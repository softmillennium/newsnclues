            Last week, Tara Eacobacci had an appointment with her doctor that was devoted exclusively to the topic of health insurance. A major change to her prescription benefits meant the medication she was using to manage her weight – a treatment that had taken years of trial and error to get right – would no longer be covered by insurance.
    


            “I'm completely outraged,” Eacobacci said. “It's not only causing me stress, but it is making me angry.”
    


            Starting Tuesday, CVS Caremark – a major pharmacy benefit manager that serves as a middleman for health insurers, large employers and other payers to manage their prescription drug plans – will stop covering Eli Lilly's Zepbound, a blockbuster GLP-1 drug that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration since November 2023 for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or who are overweight.
    


            “This change is happening because there's another covered medication that's safe and effective for your condition and may cost less,” CVS Caremark said in a letter sent in May to its patients using Zepbound. “Please keep in mind, if you refill your current medication on or after 7/1/2025, you'll need to pay the full cost.”
    


An experimental drug drove people to lose 23% of their body weight. It's still seen as a disappointment



            Wegovy, the GLP-1 medication to treat obesity from Lilly competitor Novo Nordisk, will still be covered under plans managed by CVS Caremark, along with a few other medications that are generally less effective.
    


            CVS says the decision to cover Wegovy and exclude Zepbound is “forcing the drug manufacturers to compete with one another” and will encourage both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to lower prices for their products in the US.
    


            “The egregiously high list prices set by drug manufacturers of GLP-1s for weight loss are the single biggest barrier to patient access,” CVS Health said in a statement. “Our formulary strategy maintains clinically appropriate coverage while using competition to drive lower costs.”
    


            But pharmacy benefit managers – of which CVS Caremark is one of the largest – have faced scrutiny for their role in rising drug costs in the US.
    


            The coverage change applies to CVS Caremark's most common formulary template, which represents between 25 and 30 million individuals overall. When the choice was available, the subset of members who take weight-loss drugs chose Wegovy and Zepbound at roughly equivalent levels, CVS Health said.
    


            When it comes to weight loss, providers and patients argue that GLP-1 medications are not a one-for-one swap and that volatile insurance coverage contradicts the science and experience of people managing obesity as a chronic disease.
    


            “Largely across society, we don't accept obesity as a long-term chronic disease, and we're still looking for quick fixes and quick solutions where that's not the reality of the biology and disease process. The mindsets have not caught up with the science yet,” said Dr. Tracy Zvenyach, director of policy strategy and alliances at the Obesity Action Coalition, a nonprofit advocacy group.
    


            “If decision-makers do not understand obesity to be a long-term chronic disease, that's when we see these exclusionary policies or these very, very cumbersome utilization management practices that really just set up one barrier after another to prevent people from getting the care that they need. It's unacceptable. We don't do that with other chronic diseases.”
    


            It takes time to develop a treatment plan with GLP-1 drugs that works with each individual patient, said Dr. Jody Dushay, an endocrinologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Some people might have an allergic reaction at the injection site for one medication or have worse side effects – such as severe constipation, nausea or stomach pain – with one than another.
    


            Adapting to a change in medication will often interrupt a patient's weight-loss trajectory, she said, and the trial-and-error could create a lot of waste for medications that were in shortage not long ago.
    


            “As soon as these announcements [about insurance coverage changes] come out, I get flooded with messages from patients,” she said. “It's very stressful for patients who have been doing really well, who are having good tolerance and feel like they have hit their stride in terms of medication, nutrition and exercise. Everything is heading in the right direction, and then having to switch can be very disruptive.”
    


FDA crackdown on off-brand Ozempic products set to take effect, threatening supply and access for many



            When Dushay is looking through a patient's medical chart, she says, her stomach churns when she sees the little box that indicates their insurance information.
    


            “In this field of weight management, that little teeny part of the chart dictates so much of their care. For me, it's unprecedented in terms of how much insurance matters for the clinical care that I'm providing and the choices that I have,” she said.
    


            And discussing strategies to manage insurance-mandated changes in treatment infringes on clinical care.
    


            “There is barely time to ask the patient how they are feeling, about side effects and weight loss and general health updates,” Dushay said. “There is a loss of time for patient care and a huge increase in time burden outside the visit for doctors and pharmacists.”
    


            Another major insurance change coming next year will affect another large swath of Dushay's patients: In January, BCBS Massachusetts will be excluding all GLP-1s from coverage for treatment of obesity, reserving coverage for these drugs only when indicated to treat type 2 diabetes.
    


            “The nation is facing an obesity crisis. That's why we work hard to support our members achieve a healthy weight by improving access to nutritious food, physical activity programs, and quality clinical care when needed,” David Merritt, senior vice president of external affairs for the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, said in a statement. “We share the enthusiasm for the real weight loss success experienced by the countless patients taking GLP-1s. As with any new medication, there is more to learn to ensure patients are set up for success. Last year, we published a study that found roughly 60% of people do not stay on GLP-1s long enough to see meaningful weight loss. While adherence is improving, we need more data to ensure these costly medications deliver long-term value for patients and the health care system.”
    


            Zepbound and Wegovy are both effective at treating obesity and approved by the FDA to do so, but there are differences.
    


            Studies have found that people who used tirzepatide injections such as Zepbound lost more weight and were more likely to reach specific weight loss targets than those using semaglutide medications such as Wegovy. The two drugs have a different set of broader indications, with Zepbound also approved to treat sleep apnea in people with obesity, for example. Side effects can vary, too, sometimes making one medication more tolerable than the another.
    


            People who have had success with Zepbound may be able to file for an exception after the insurance coverage changes, but CVS Caremark has limited options to proactively plan for the change, leaving many patients angry and concerned about their health and well-being.
    


            For Eacobacci, the insurance changes and the sentiment behind them are enraging – and based in prejudice.
    


Popular injected weight loss medications work better for one sex. Researchers want to know why



            CVS Caremark had required that she try multiple alternate treatments and prove that they didn't work before she was approved for Zepbound this year. When she was on Wegovy, she said, her A1C glucose levels started to rise close to prediabetic levels despite consistent diet and exercise habits. This all changed once she started Zepbound.
    


            “I feel better. I'm not as bloated. My movement is definitely different. I fit into my clothes, but I also feel validated – because all of these years, doctors say to you, ‘Oh, you can't eat all that cake and candy,' and they don't believe that you're not,” Eacobacci said. “The medication actually validated some of this. Like, ‘hey, I do need support. I can't do this on my own as much as I'm trying.' ”
    


            Medication changes could have unnecessarily dangerous impacts on physical health – Eacobacci said she gained 10 pounds and saw her A1C levels spike in just one month without the medication – as well as mental health.
    


            “Weight stigma and bias has affected us nationwide,” said Eacobacci, who is worried about many people she knows who have felt depressed after the hearing the news about changes in insurance coverage. “You made me jump through hoops. I got the prior authorization you required for me, and now you're – mid-year – taking it away from me is so impactful that it should be illegal.”
    


            Although coverage exceptions may be an option, the appeals process takes time.
    


            “It gets really, really frustrating to have to justify what I want to do all the time just because of money,” Dushay said.
    


            For people who do lose coverage of Zepbound, drugmaker Eli Lilly has expanded access through LillyDirect, a company platform that helps coordinate telehealth services and fill prescriptions for patients who pay out-of-pocket. Single-dose vials are available for $499 per month through the LillyDirect Zepbound Self Pay Journey Program, with the highest doses available beginning July 7.
    


            “We're confident in Zepbound's performance and remain committed to ensuring patients have access to the treatment they need,” Lilly said in a statement.

            The Trump administration has declared that it will aggressively combat chronic disease in America.
    


            Yet in its feverish purge of federal health programs, it has proposed eliminating the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion and its annual funding of $1.4 billion.
    


            That's one of many disconnects between what the administration says about health — notably, in the “MAHA Report” that President Donald Trump recently presented at the White House — and what it's actually doing, scientists and public health advocates say.
    


            Among other contradictions:
    


            “There are many inconsistencies between rhetoric and action,” said Alonzo Plough, chief science officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a philanthropy focused on health.
    


            The report, a cornerstone of President Donald Trump's “Make America Healthy Again” agenda, was issued by a commission that includes Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other top administration officials.
    


            News organizations found that it footnoted nonexistent sources and contained signs that it was produced with help from artificial intelligence. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described the problems as “formatting issues,” and the administration revised the report.
    


            Trump ordered the report to assess causes of a “childhood chronic disease crisis.” His commission is now working on a plan of action.
    


            Spokespeople for the White House and Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions for this article.
    


            The MAHA report says environmental chemicals may pose risks to children's health. Citing the National Institutes of Health, it said there's a “need for continued studies from the public and private sectors, especially the NIH, to better understand the cumulative load of multiple exposures and how it may impact children's health.”
    


            Meanwhile, the administration has cut funding for related studies.
    


            For example, in 2020 the Environmental Protection Agency asked scientists to propose ways of researching children's exposure to chemicals from soil and dust. It said that, for kids ages 6 months to 6 years, ingesting particulates — by putting their hands on the ground or floor then in their mouths — could be a significant means of exposure to contaminants such as herbicides, pesticides, and a group of chemicals known as PFAS.
    


One of the grants — for almost $1.4 million over several years — went to a team of scientists at Johns Hopkins University and the University of California-San Francisco. Researchers gained permission to collect samples from people's homes, including dust and diapers.
    


            But, beyond a small test run, they didn't get to analyze the urine and stool samples because the grant was terminated this spring, said study leader Keeve Nachman, a professor of environmental health and engineering at Hopkins.
    


            “The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities,” the agency said in a May 10 termination notice.
    


            Another EPA solicitation from 2020 addressed many of the issues the MAHA report highlighted: cumulative exposures to chemicals and developmental problems such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obesity, anxiety, and depression. One of the resulting grants funded the Center for Early Life Exposures and Neurotoxicity at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. That grant was ended weeks early in May, said the center's director, Stephanie Engel, a UNC professor of epidemiology.
    


            In a statement, EPA press secretary Brigit Hirsch said the agency “is continuing to invest in research and labs to advance the mission of protecting human health and the environment.” Due to an agency reorganization, “the way these grants are administered will be different going forward,” said Hirsch, who did not otherwise answer questions about specific grants.
    


            In its battle with Harvard, the Trump administration has stopped paying for research the NIH had commissioned on topics such as how autism might be related to paternal exposure to air pollution.
    


            The loss of millions of dollars of NIH funding has also undermined data-gathering for long-term research on chronic diseases, Harvard researchers said. A series of projects with names like Nurses' Health Study II and Nurses' Health Study 3 have been tracking thousands of people for decades and aimed to keep tracking them as long as possible as well as enrolling new participants, even across generations.
    


NIH froze funding for clinical trials at a major university. By fall, they'll run out of funding



            The work has included periodically surveying participants — mainly nurses and other health professionals who enrolled to support science — and collecting biological samples such as blood, urine, stool, or toenail clippings.
    


            Researchers studying health problems such as autism, ADHD, or cancer could tap the data and samples to trace potential contributing factors, said Francine Laden, an environmental epidemiologist at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The information could retrospectively reveal exposures before people were born — when they were still in utero — and exposures their parents experienced before they were conceived.
    


            Harvard expected that some of the grants wouldn't be renewed, but the Trump administration brought ongoing funding to an abrupt end, said Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Chan school.
    


            As a result, researchers are scrambling to find money to keep following more than 200,000 people who enrolled in studies beginning in the 1980s — including children of participants who are now adults themselves — and to preserve about 2 million samples, Willett said.
    


            “So now our ability to do exactly what the administration wants to do is jeopardized,” said Jorge Chavarro, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Chan school. “And there's not an equivalent resource. It's not like you can magically recreate these resources without having to wait 20 or 30 years to be able to answer the questions” that the Trump administration “wants answered now.”
    


            Over the past few months, the administration has fired or pushed out almost 5,000 NIH employees, blocked almost $3 billion in grant funding from being awarded, and terminated almost 2,500 grants totaling almost $5 billion, said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, at a June 10 hearing on the NIH budget.
    


            In addition, research institutions have been waiting months to receive money under grants they've already been awarded, Murray said.
    


            In canceling hundreds of grants with race, gender, or sexuality dimensions, the administration engaged in blatant discrimination, a federal judge ruled on June 16.
    


            After issuing the MAHA report, the administration published budget proposals to cut funding for the NIH by $17.0 billion, or 38%, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by $550 million, or 12%, and the EPA by $5 billion, or 54%.
    


            “This budget reflects the President's vision of making Americans the healthiest in the world while achieving his goal of transforming the bureaucracy,” the HHS “Budget in Brief” document says. Elements of Trump's proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year clash with priorities laid out in the MAHA report.
    


            Kennedy has cited diabetes as part of a crisis in children's health. The $1.4 billion unit the White House has proposed to eliminate at the CDC — the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion — has housed a program to track diabetes in children, adolescents, and young adults.
    


            “To say that you want to focus on chronic diseases” and then “to, for all practical purposes, eliminate the entity at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which does chronic diseases,” said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, “obviously doesn't make a lot of sense.”
    


            In a May letter, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought listed the chronic disease center as “duplicative, DEI, or simply unnecessary,” using an abbreviation for diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.
    


            Within the NIH, the White House has proposed cutting $320 million from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, a reduction of 35%. That unit funds or conducts a wide array of research on issues such as chronic disease.
    


            Trump's budget proposes spending $500 million “to tackle priority activities to Make America Healthy Again,” including $260 million for his new Administration for a Healthy America to address the “chronic illness epidemic.”
    


            The MAHA report argues that corporate influence has compromised government agencies and public health through “corporate capture.”
    


            It alleges that most research on chronic childhood diseases is funded by the food, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries, as well as special interest organizations and professional associations. It says, for example, that a “significant portion of environmental toxicology and epidemiology studies are conducted by private corporations,” including pesticide manufacturers, and it cites “potential biases in industry-funded research.”
    


            It's “self-evident that cutbacks in federal funding leave the field open to the very corporate funding RFK has decried,” said Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a watchdog group focused on food and health.
    


            Lurie shared the report's concern about industry-funded research but said ceding ground to industry won't help. “Industry will tend to fund those studies that look to them like they will yield results beneficial to industry,” he said.
    


            In search of new funding sources, Harvard's school of public health “is now ramping up targeted outreach to potential corporate partners, with careful review to ensure the science meets the highest standards of research integrity,” Andrea Baccarelli, dean of the school's faculty, wrote in a June 11 letter to students, faculty, and others.
    


            “It's just simple math that if you devastate governmental funding by tens of billions of dollars, then the percentage of industry funding dollars will go up,” said Plough, who is also a clinical professor at the University of Washington School of Public Health.
    


            “So therefore, what they claim to fear more,” he said, will “become even more influential.”
    


            The MAHA report says “the U.S. government is committed to fostering radical transparency and gold-standard science.”
    


            But many scientists and other scholars see the Trump administration waging a war on science that conflicts with its agenda.
    


Unusual pushback, ‘dangerous precedent': What the first meeting of Kennedy's CDC advisers reveals about the future of vaccines in America



            In March, members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine accused the administration of “destroying” scientific independence, “engaging in censorship,” and “pressuring researchers to alter or abandon their work on ideological grounds.”
    


            In May, NIH employees wrote that the administration was politicizing research — for example, by halting or censoring work on health disparities, health impacts of climate change, gender identity, and immunizations.
    


            Recent comments by Kennedy pose another threat to transparency, researchers and health advocates say.
    


            Kennedy said on a podcast that he would probably create in-house government journals and stop NIH scientists from publishing their research in The Lancet, The New England Journal of Medicine, The Journal of the American Medical Association, and others.
    


            Creating new government outlets for research would be a plus, said Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University.
    


            But confining government scientists to government journals, he said, “would be a disaster” and “would basically amount to censorship.”
    


            “That's just not a good idea for science,” Mozaffarian said.

The results of NATO countries hiking military budgets will be “catastrophic” and lead to the bloc's collapse, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday. His remarks mirrored Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski's earlier suggestion that a boost in Moscow's defense spending could trigger the fall of the government. 

At NATO's most recent summit last month in the Hague, member states committed to spending 5% of GDP on the military – a significant rise from the previous 2% target. Poland backed the hike, arguing that failing to achieve the new benchmark “as soon as possible” would pose a ‘‘threat'‘ to the bloc considering the ongoing Ukraine conflict.

In an interview with Polish media, Sikorski drew a parallel between modern Russia and the late USSR. Referring to President Vladimir Putin, he stated that “he himself once said that the Soviet Union fell because it spent too much on armament, and now he is doing exactly the same thing.”

Meanwhile, speaking to the press at the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) Foreign Ministers Council in Kyrgyzstan, Sergey Lavrov took issue with Sikorski's characterization, countering: “Perhaps he foresees – being such a prophet – that this catastrophic, in my view, increase in NATO countries' budgets will also lead to the organization's collapse.”

Lavrov also said that Russia “plans to reduce its military spending,” which now accounts for 6.3% of GDP, and “be guided by common sense, but not made-up threats like NATO member states, including Sikorsky.”

The 5% GDP target faced opposition from some NATO members. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said his country could not allocate one-fifth of its state budget to defense, while Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called the goal “not only unreasonable but also counterproductive.”

Italian authorities are looking to classify a long-term project to construct a bridge connecting the mainland to the island of Sicily as a NATO expenditure amid their struggle to meet the bloc's spending goals, according to Politico.

The idea of creating an overpass to the largest island in the Mediterranean had been discussed in Italy for many decades, but its realization has been hampered by high costs, the difficulty of operating in a seismic zone and other issues. If built by the current government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the 3.6-km-long suspension bridge across the Strait of Messina will become the longest in the world.

In its article on Monday, Politico described Italy as “one of NATO's lowest military spenders,” with Rome investing only 1.49% of its GDP in defense last year, a far cry from the 5% goal approved at the bloc's summit in The Hague in June.

Marking the $13.5 billion bridge as a NATO spending could help Meloni meet the bloc's 5% target and, at the same time, “convince a war-wary public of the need for major defense outlays at a time when Italy is already inching toward austerity,” the article read.

An unnamed Italian government official told the outlet that no formal decision has yet been made by Rome on classifying the bridge as a security project, but further talks would likely be held soon to “see how feasible this feels.”

According to another official from the Italian Treasury, who also talked to Politico, the new designation of the project would make raising money for it easier and would also “override bureaucratic obstacles, litigation with local authorities that could challenge the government in court claiming that the bridge will disproportionately damage their land.”

The problem for Rome is that the Strait of Messina lies outside of Italy's only designated NATO military mobility corridor, the article pointed out.

However, the Italian case is backed by the fact that only 3.5% from the NATO spending target must be allocated for core military needs, while the remaining 1.5% could be steered toward broader strategic resilience projects, including infrastructure.

“Whether NATO — and more importantly, US President Donald Trump, who loves a big building project — will buy into that logic is another matter,” Politico noted.

Former warlord Ahmad al-Sharaa, who seized power in Syria last year, may abandon the country's claim to sovereignty over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in exchange for normalized ties with West Jerusalem, according to a report by Lebanese media.

Israel captured a large portion of the 1,800 square kilometer region of Syria's Quneitra Governorate during the 1967 war and effectively annexed it in 1981. Amid the turmoil during al-Sharaa's rise to power, the IDF seized additional territory.

The IDF has also carried out multiple airstrikes against Syrian troops loyal to the current government, which West Jerusalem said were intended to protect the local Druze population, an ethnoreligious minority community which inhabits the contested region.

Lebanese broadcaster LBCI reported Monday that the two countries could normalize relations as part of a broad agreement. Under the proposed deal, Israel would recognize al-Sharaa's legitimacy, withdraw troops from areas seized since his December takeover, and agree to Syria's military presence near its borders with Israel and Jordan, with certain restrictions.

In exchange, “Israel is expected to secure full sovereignty” over the Golan Heights, LBCI said, citing sources familiar with Syrian affairs. The report added that internal hardliner opposition, including from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham – the jihadist group formerly led by al-Sharaa – could derail the effort.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said Monday that Israel will maintain control of the Golan Heights under any future peace arrangement with Syria.

Al-Sharaa has sought international recognition since ousting President Bashar Assad. Under former President Barack Obama, the United States aimed to remove Assad through a combination of sanctions and covert support for anti-government armed groups labeled “moderate rebels.” On Monday, President Donald Trump lifted most US sanctions on Syria in order to facilitate the flow of foreign aid for the country's reconstruction.

SEOUL, July 1. /TASS/. A delegation from a major North Korean military school has departed for Russia, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.

The delegation led by the school's chief, Kim Kum Chol, is planning to visit the Military Academy of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces. They departed Pyongyang on June 30, and representatives of the elite North Korean military academy, and the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), and employees of the Russian embassy in North Korea saw them off at the airport. Kim Kum Chol last travelled to Russia in July 2024.

On Monday, a Russian delegation led by Culture Minister Olga Lyubimova saw sights including a state gift museum, an Orthodox church, and a Juche music and arts center, KCNA reported.

Russia and the DPRK have significantly intensified bilateral exchanges since the latter half of 2023 when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited Russia. In June 2024, the two countries signed an agreement on comprehensive strategic partnership.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

WASHINGTON, July 1. /TASS/. Tehran will return to talks with Washington as soon as it receives guarantees that the US won't attack again, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CBS News.

""I don't think negotiations will restart as quickly as that. In order for us to decide to reengage, we will have to first ensure that America will not revert back to targeting us in a military attack during the negotiations. And I think with all these considerations, we still need more time [to make a decision],"" the top diplomat told the TV channel in response to a question on whether Tehran and Washington would engage in talks this week.

According to Araghchi, during the 12-day armed conflict with Israel, Iran ""showed and proved that we have the ability to defend ourselves, and we will continue to do so should any aggression be launched against us."" When asked if it was possible to peacefully settle the conflict with the US, the Iranian foreign minister noted that ""the doors of diplomacy will never slam shut.""

""One cannot obliterate the technology and science for enrichment through bombings. If there is this will on our part, and the will exists in order to once again make progress in this industry, we will be able to expeditiously repair the damages and make up for the lost time,"" Araghchi emphasized. The top diplomat also said that the country's ""peaceful nuclear program has turned into a matter of national pride and glory.""

On June 25, President Donald Trump announced that the United States and Iran would hold nuclear talks the following week. On June 28, NBC News reported that US presidential special envoy Steve Witkoff would hold consultations with Iranian representatives in the coming days regarding a potential nuclear program agreement. According to the TV channel, the talks would address Iran halting uranium enrichment in exchange for the US easing sanctions. The Iranian authorities have repeatedly stated that they will never abandon the development of a peaceful nuclear program, which includes uranium enrichment.

From April through May, Iranian and US officials held five rounds of consultations on the nuclear program. However, the negotiation process was frozen due to Israel's subsequent military operation against Iran and US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Homeland security secretary was paid by group listed as American Resolve Police Fund, according to Politico

The US homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, failed to disclose $80,000 that she accepted while serving as South Dakota's governor, according to a report published on Monday.

The investigative news website ProPublica said tax records from 2023 show Noem was paid the sum by a group listed as American Resolve Policy Fund – but it has never made it on to her public ethics disclosures.

Noem was paid for helping the group – which does not disclose its donors – to fundraise, but the non-profit, a so-called dark money group, went on to run social media attack ads targeting local news outlets that had reported on her alleged misuse of taxpayer funds while serving as governor.

Noem, who was assigned a leading role in the immigration crackdown and related deportation efforts that Donald Trump has helmed since returning to the presidency in January, has developed a reputation for an opulent lifestyle.

As South Dakota governor in 2021, on a salary of $130,000, Noem spent $68,000 installing a sauna, chandeliers and rugs in the governor's mansion, according to the Sioux Falls Argus Leader.

She was sued in March 2024 by the consumer advocacy group Travelers United over a social media video promoting a dental practice named Smile Texas. The lawsuit alleges Noem failed to disclose any potential financial relationship with the Texas dental practice, and the Instagram video was not correctly labelled as an advertisement.

More recently, Noem raised eyebrows when she wore a $50,000 gold Rolex Cosmograph Daytona watch while visiting El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), the prison that is holding alleged Tren de Aragua members deported from the US.

Noem also made headlines when her Gucci handbag containing $3,000 in cash was stolen from a restaurant in Washington.

ProPublica does not assert that Noem broke campaign finance laws in receiving the payment from American Resolve Policy Fund. Lawmakers helping non-profits and other political groups fundraise is not uncommon.

But it is not common practice to be rewarded for doing so.

“There's no way the governor is supposed to have a private side business that the public doesn't know about,” Lee Schoenbeck, a longtime Republican attorney and lawmaker, told ProPublica. “It would clearly not be appropriate.”

The Associated Press reported in March that while Noem campaigned for Trump as South Dakota governor, the state picked up some expenses. That included trips to Palm Beach, Florida, from where Trump was then managing his victorious 2024 presidential campaign.

The outlet reported that over her six years as governor, South Dakota covered more than $640,000 in travel-related costs incurred by the governor's office – including a $7,555 air fare for a six-day trip to Paris to speak at a political event – and costs associated with a bear hunt in Canada with her niece.

Those expenses, reported on by the Dakota Scout, incensed some members of her party. Dennis Daugaard, a former Republican South Dakota governor, said the cost to taxpayers in service of raising her national profile “offends a lot of people”.

Taffy Howard, a Republican state senator who sparred with Noem over her expenses, said it “seems like an incredible amount of money”.

But the AP cautioned that there was “no indication” that the former governor had broken any laws by having the state foot her security expenses.

“Unfortunately, bad guys tend to make threats against high-profile public officials,” Noem's then spokesperson, Tim Murtaugh, said. “When it was a political or personal trip, she paid for her own travel out of her political or personal funds.”

The latest questions concerning Noem's relationship with American Resolve Policy Fund, a group that describes its mission as “fighting to preserve America for the next generation”, reflect how some quarters may view personal brand-building, via product marketing opportunities, as part of a contemporary political career. Trump, for one, has fostered that approach.

In a statement to Politico, Noem's lawyer, Trevor Stanley, said that the former South Dakota governor “fully complied with the letter and the spirit of the law”.

Stanley said the US office of government ethics, which processes disclosure forms for federal officials, “analyzed and cleared her financial information in regards to this entity”.

According to ProPublica, Stanley claimed Noem “fully disclosed all of her income on public documents that are readily available” but did not respond to further questioning.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Justice department charges 324 defendants in largest healthcare fraud initiative in its history

The US justice department said on Monday that it halted a series of healthcare fraud schemes that sought to bilk the federal government out of $14.6bn.

The operation, which the department called the largest healthcare fraud initiative in its history, led to criminal charges against 324 defendants and the seizure of more than $245m in cash, luxury cars and other assets. The actual loss to the US government totaled about $2.9bn, officials said.

“Today marks a decisive moment in our fight to protect American taxpayers from fraudsters and to defend the integrity of America's healthcare system,” Matthew Galeotti, the head of the justice department's criminal division, told reporters during a press conference.

Those charged include 93 doctors and other medical professionals accused of submitting false claims to government healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid.

Some of the schemes were run by transnational criminal organizations based outside the US, that have been perpetrating increasingly complex fraud operations targeting the American healthcare system, justice department officials said.

One such scheme, which prosecutors said was run out of Russia and eastern European countries, led to charges against 19 defendants, 12 of whom have been arrested.

The group used a network of foreign straw owners to buy dozens of US medical supply companies and, using stolen American identities, submitted more than $10bn in fraudulent claims to Medicare, according to the justice department.

Among those whose identities were compromised was Gerald Quindry, a 73-year-old retired engineer on Medicare. He was billed $15,500 for urinary catheters, though his doctor never ordered them nor did Quindry want nor receive them, as the Washington Post reported.

Quindry – who told the Post, “obviously, somebody deserves to be in jail” over the plot – had complained to Medicare, but program representatives had initially seemed unbothered.

“It's not being done by small-time operators,” said Dr Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. “These are organized syndicates who are designing to hurt America.”

Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) released on July 1 video footage showing domestically produced drones striking multiple Russian air defense assets and a fighter jet in occupied Crimea in what it described as a successful special operation.

The undated footage shows the combat use of UJ-26 drones, commonly known as Bober (Beavers), targeting high-value Russian military systems.

""These reliable weapons in the hands of HUR special forces are turning critically important Russian targets into useless scrap,"" the agency said in a statement. 

HUR added that the Bober drones are effectively ""gnawing through"" Russia's expensive air defense systems ""like barberries.""

The released footage shows that the strikes destroyed or severely damaged several Russian military assets, including a Pantsir-S1 air defense system and its crew, a Niobium-SV radar, a Pechora-3 coastal radar, a Protivnik-GE radar, and a Su-30 fighter jet stationed at the Saky airfield in occupied Crimea. 

The Kyiv Independent could not verify HUR's claims.

The strikes are part of Ukraine's ongoing efforts to degrade Russian military capabilities in Crimea, which has been under Russian occupation since 2014. Moscow reported Ukrainian drone strikes against the peninsula earlier on July 1, with the Crimean Wind Telegram channel reporting attacks in the vicinity of S-300/S-400 air defense systems.

Ukraine has increasingly deployed new drone systems to target Russian military assets on the front line and deep inside the Russian rear.

The command follows a string of Russian missile attacks against Ukrainian military training facilities that have resulted in a number of killed and injured service members.

U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Syria's interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on May 14.Saudi Royal Palace/The Associated Press

U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday ending many U.S. economic sanctions on Syria, following through on a promise he made to the country's new interim leader.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the move was designed to “promote and support the country's path to stability and peace.”

The executive order is meant to “end the country's isolation from the international financial system, setting the stage for global commerce and galvanizing investments from its neighbors in the region, as well as from the United States,” Treasury's acting undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, Brad Smith, told reporters on a call Monday to preview the administration's action.

Monday's actions do not rescind sanctions imposed on ousted former President Bashar Assad, his top aides, family members and officials who had been determined to have committed human rights abuses or been involved in drug trafficking or part of Syria's chemical weapons program.

It also leaves intact a major set of sanctions passed by Congress targeting anyone doing business with or offering support to Syria's military, intelligence or other suspect institutions. While the Trump administration has passed temporary waivers on those sanctions, known as the Caesar Act, they can only be permanently repealed by law.

Canada should reduce Syria sanctions to align with U.S. and Britain, experts say

The White House posted the text of the order on X after the signing, which was not open to the press.

The U.S. granted Syria sweeping exemptions from sanctions in May, which was a first step toward fulfilling the Republican president's pledge to lift a half-century of penalties on a country shattered by 13 years of civil war.

Along with the lifting of economic sanctions, Monday's executive order lifts the national emergency outlined in an executive order issued by former President George W. Bush in response to Syria's occupation of Lebanon and pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, Treasury officials said. Five other previous executive orders related to Syria were also lifted.

Sanctions targeting terrorist groups and manufacturers and sellers of the amphetamine-like stimulant Captagon will remain in place.

Trump met with Syria's interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in Saudi Arabia in May and told him he would lift sanctions and explore normalizing relations in a major policy shift in relations between the U.S. and Syria.

“This is another promise made and promise kept,” Leavitt said Monday.

The European Union has also followed through with lifting nearly all remaining sanctions on Syria.

Still, some restrictions remain in place. The U.S. still designates Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism and the group led by al-Sharaa as a foreign terrorist organization.

A State Department official said the department is reviewing those designations.

The best thing Canada and Prime Minister Mark Carney's government can do is just keep calm and carry on.BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images

As Forrest Gump's momma might have said, had she been a Canadian trade negotiator, dealing with Donald Trump is like a box of chocolates: You never know what you're gonna get.

Or what you'll be asked to give up. Or what, if anything, the U.S. President will offer in return. Or what will set him off, or calm him down. Or whether he's put rocks in the Turtles. Or if you make a deal, whether he'll rip it up before the ink is dry.

Late Sunday evening, Ottawa abandoned its digital services tax, just hours before it was to go into effect, after Mr. Trump said he was ending all trade talks until Canada scrapped it. The levy has been in the works for years, but the White House has long opposed it, going back to when Joe Biden was president. 

The tax is, or was, a 3-per-cent levy on income earned in Canada by major players on the web. The theory behind it is that foreign (mostly American) companies making money in Canada through the sale of digital services do so without facing taxation on earnings in this country.

Washington was always going to push for the elimination of the tax as part of a broader trade deal. And Canada, it is fair to bet, was going to be willing to give in to that demand, if it unlocked a deal. 

The digital services tax was bad policy, but killing it now makes us look terribly weak

A guide to The Globe's Canada Day coverage

Was Canada threatening to start collecting money on June 30 partly as a bargaining tactic? Had the tax become the kind of irritant you put in the window precisely because the other side wants it removed it, thereby kicking off some horse trading? 

The tax was expected to bring in about $900-million a year. That's small change. It's like a car salesman throwing in a free bottle of Turtle Wax.

Mr. Trump publicly halting negotiations until Canada dropped something it was going to drop in those negotiations may be a way for the President to look like the big man who made an opponent bend to his will. It may open the door to a trade deal, which the Trump administration will be able to sell not only as one of the promised “90 deals in 90 days,” but a victory. 

The Canadian concession is small. But if there's a trade agreement in the coming weeks, it could allow the MAGA mediasphere to proclaim that Mr. Trump has once again demonstrated his unparalleled negotiating genius and power, and used it for the benefit of an American industry.

That's the best version of how this story ends. Canada gets what it wants, which is a trade deal that largely maintains the one agreed under the last Trump administration: the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). And Mr. Trump gets what he wants, which is the appearance of dominance and the impression that he won something.

But negotiating with Mr. Trump is like a bottomless box of chocolates: There's always something else. And something else after that.

Canada made a concession that it was almost certainly prepared to concede, but what did it get in return? Are there more demands that Mr. Trump will pull out of his hat, as he's been doing since before his inauguration? 

We've faced tariffs based on an imaginary flood of cross-border fentanyl; demands for more military spending; tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum; and now this insistence that Canada rewrite domestic tax law. Any more bonbons down there?

The President was on Fox News on Sunday, once again railing against supply management, and claiming that Canada is “very nasty to deal with” and that “they cheat” on the USMCA. And of course we should be the 51st state because “Canada relies entirely on the United States.”

Until a few years ago, retailer L.L. Bean had a lifetime return policy: You could return anything, forever. Like the customers who abused that policy until it had to be ended, Mr. Trump has taken this approach to the USMCA: I signed on the dotted line, but I can un-sign at any time. 

With threats and tariffs that violate the terms of the agreement, he has started ripping it up. And he has given every sign that he wants some tariffs to remain, even in a post-USMCA deal.

The best Canada can do is what Prime Minister Mark Carney's government is trying to do: Keep calm and carry on. Focus on the things we control, like our own economy, our own ability to get things built, our own capacity to strengthen relationships with more reliable partners. 

Meanwhile, it's Canada Day – the day when the United Province of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick joined together in Confederation. Canada was not created in 1867. It was expanded and improved. Improvement and expansion continued in the years and decades after. 

We've had an evolving and continually progressing political system, unbroken by successful domestic revolution or foreign invasion, since 1763. Ours is one of the world's oldest and most stable polities.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people and businesses in Quebec put up signs that read: Ça va bien aller. It'll all work out. Even with that guy in the White House, ça va bien aller. We always find a way. Happy Canada Day.

Germany is ramping up defense spending — while cutting funds for development cooperation. Aid organizations warn of the consequences for millions of people in a world beset by wars and crises.

Germany's draft federal budget for 2025 includes sweeping cuts. The Economic Cooperation and Development Ministry (BMZ) is set to receive €10.3 billion ($12.1 billion) — nearly €1 billion less than in 2024. It's the second consecutive year that the budget has been reduced.

A glance back at 2022 underscores the scale of the decline: At that time, Germany was still spending €13.8 billion on development aid.

Michael Herbst, chair of the umbrella organization VENRO, which represents about 140 development NGOs in Germany, illustrated the human cost of these dramatic cuts amid growing global conflict. ""More than 100 million people are displaced,"" Herbst said. ""At the same time, more and more donor countries are pulling back."" That's why, he said, Germany needs to ensure stable funding for development cooperation and humanitarian aid. But the opposite is occurring.

Germany's cuts come at a time when US President Donald Trump, early in his second term, has also initiated deep reductions in development aid, reportedly slashing about 80% of funding.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization agreed at its recent summit on June 25, 2025, that each NATO member state should spend 5% of its gross domestic product on defense annually.

Against this backdrop, the global decline in development aid stands out all the more. The consequences are already becoming clear, especially in the field of humanitarian assistance.

The United States has completely withdrawn its support for the UN-administered relief fund. Faced with sweeping international cutbacks, emergency aid coordinator Tom Fletcher says he is being forced to shut down numerous programs for the world's poorest.

Weeks ago, Fletcher warned that the impact on people in need and suffering from hunger would be devastating. Instead of the originally projected $44 billion, Fletcher now expects just $29 billion to be available for distributing food, water, medicine, shelter, and other essential aid.

Fletcher said the reduced funding would enable 114 million people to be reached — down from the 180 million originally planned.

Because of the sharp reduction in the BMZ budget, Germany's official development assistance ratio fell below its self-imposed goal of 0.7% of gross national income in 2024. It had consistently remained above that threshold since 2020.

Humanitarian emergency aid is being slashed by 53%, to about €1 billion. VENRO chair, Herbst, says the move is short-sighted: ""As the world's third-largest economy, Germany can and must take responsibility here. It cannot continue cutting budgets in these areas."" However, his push for a reversal was unsuccessful.

As an export-driven nation, Germany depends on strong international ties and global stability. ""The German economy benefits from a solid reputation and reliable relationships in countries of the Global South. That helps secure jobs here at home, as well,"" Herbst points out.

The NGOs Welthungerhilfe and Terre des Hommes give the federal government a poor overall assessment. However, the coalition agreement between the governing center-right Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) and center-left Social Democratic Party describes the cuts to development and humanitarian aid as ""appropriate.""

In response, the aid organizations counter: ""That contradicts the government's own stated goal of ensuring sustainable humanitarian funding — especially at a time when other donor countries are pulling out.""

All the same, Development Minister Reem Alabali Radovan, a Social Democrat, said Germany remained committed to its global responsibilities — ""despite painful budgetary constraints on development spending imposed by the coalition agreement.""

EU subsidies for growing bananas on Mount Olympus? A scandal concerning illegally obtained EU agricultural subsidies has rocked Greece and led to a number of resignations.

Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis was unusually contrite at the weekend. ""We failed,"" he wrote on Facebook, promising to step up the fight against corruption — even within his own party, New Democracy (ND).

Mitsotakis was responding to the latest scandal concerning the misuse of EU subsidies in Greece, which is currently being investigated by the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO).

The scandal revolves around several hundred million euros in agricultural subsidies, which were paid out to applicants by the Greek government agency OPEKEPE.

Examples include subsidies for nonexistent sheep and goats on the island of Crete and banana plantations on Mount Olympus.

It is reported that this happened with the knowledge of two former agriculture ministers in Mitsotakis's government: Makis Voridis, who was in office from 2021 to 2023, and his successor, Lefteris Avgenakis, who held the post until 2024.

Voridis, who also enjoys a good reputation as a legal expert, was made migration minister in March of this year. He resigned on Friday, saying he wished to focus on ""defending his innocence.""

Three other state ministers implicated in the scandal have also submitted their resignations. 

The reports relating to OPEKEPE surfaced several months ago, and, on June 17, the European Commission imposed a fine of €415 million ($486 million) on Greece.

The EPPO lodged an official complaint in May and accused the Greek authorities on Crete of trying to obstruct investigations.

But the government did not respond to the accusations and took no action — until last week, when the EPPO sent information to the Greek parliament about the reported involvement of ministers in criminal activities.

It did so because, according to Greek law, only parliament has the authority to investigate current or former members of the government. 

This means that, for the past week, Greek lawmakers have been able to study the 3,000-page file submitted by the EPPO, which may not, however, be published.

It describes a ""criminal organization"" comprising OPEKEPE officials, lawmakers and individuals who illegally obtained EU money.

The file names 15 lawmakers — 13 from the ruling ND party and one each from the opposition parties PASOK and Syriza — as well as regional civil servants and former OPEKEPE executives.

It also describes how the organization worked — above all in Crete.

Despite the ban on publication, Greeks have been able to read in newspapers in recent days some explosive conversations between officials from the ruling party that were contained in this file.

Some of the transcripts read like mafia film scripts. 

They include discussions between high-ranking civil servants about how they could, with the help of the justice minister, keep EPPO staff members out of the investigation. 

Until the publication ban is lifted, the authenticity of these conversations cannot be proved. Mitsotakis, however, does not seem to question their authenticity.

""The dialogues that have been uncovered are causing outrage and anger,"" he wrote in his Facebook post, adding that everyone who is proved to have received EU money that they are not entitled to will be required to pay it back.

He also announced that OPEKEPE would be abolished by the end of the year.

The prime minister is trying to portray himself as a reformer and fighter in the battle against corruption and incompetence in the Greek political system. Whether the Greek public will buy it, remains to be seen.

His time in office has been overshadowed by numerous scandals, including the wiretap scandal, the deadly refugee ship tragedy off the coast of Pylos and, above all, the Tempi railway disaster.

Each time, he has pledged to get to the bottom of the scandals and that there would be consequences for those involved. None of this has happened.

This explains why over 70% of respondents in every survey conducted since the beginning of the year accuse the government of a cover-up. 

In addition, it is the EU — in the form of the European Parliament and the EPPO —  and not the Greek authorities themselves that is pushing for the resolution of the wiretap scandal, the train tragedy and now the OPEKEPE scandal.  

One thing is certain: Mitsotakis faces yet another crisis and is trying to move past it as quickly as possible, among other things with a political message to an increasingly conservative public and the right wing of his party, which is not always happy with his policies.

Mitsotakis appointed Thanos Plevris migration minister at the weekend. 

Plevris, like Voridis before him, used to be a member of the extreme right-wing Popular Orthodox Rally (LAOS). He is the only member of the conservative ND party who advocates for an even tougher stance on migration than his predecessor. 

Plevris has since 2011 had a very clear idea of how to resolve Greece's migration problem, namely by strict surveillance of the borders and deterrent measures that make the country look like ""hell"" to immigrants.

Speaking at a conference of the extreme right-wing magazine Patria at the time, he said there was no border security without victims, adding that ""border protection needs deaths.""

And, for those who did make it across the Greek border, he had another suggestion: They should get no social security, no food, no drink and no access to the health system. ""They have to have it even worse than in their own countries,"" he said, to the applause of those listening.

That was almost 15 years ago, but Plevris has never distanced himself from his xenophobic past.

George W Bush has issued a rare critique of Donald Trump over his shuttering of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

The former president joined Barack Obama and U2 singer Bono in an emotional video call farewell with staff at the agency on Monday when it officially ceased operations.

After six decades, the humanitarian organisation created by former president John F Kennedy to promote US national security by boosting prosperity and goodwill abroad, is being absorbed into the State Department under the supervision of Marco Rubio.

Speaking to thousands of agency staff on the video conference, Mr Bush took a thinly veiled swipe at cuts to USAID's HIV and aids programme. The initiative, launched under his Republican administration, is credited with saving 25 million lives around the world.

“You've showed the great strength of America through your work – and that is your good heart,'' Mr Bush told agency staffers in a recorded message. “Is it in our national interests that 25 million people who would have died now live? I think it is, and so do you.”

USAID was one of the first agencies fiercely targeted by Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) cuts to government spending, with Elon Musk branding it a “criminal organisation”.

Pushback from Congress against Doge cuts to the President's Emergency Plan for Aids (Pepfar) helped salvage significant funding to the programme.

However, the WHO has warned that Mr Trump's decision to pause US foreign aid could cause several countries to run out of HIV treatment in the coming months.

Mr Obama, who has kept a low profile during Mr Trump's second term and refrained from directly criticising the president's radical overhaul of government, described the dismantling of USAID as a “colossal mistake”.

“Your work has mattered and will matter for generations to come,” the former president told agency staff.

“Gutting USAID is a travesty, and it's a tragedy. Because it's some of the most important work happening anywhere in the world,” he added, praising government workers for saving lives and opening new US markets by boosting economic growth overseas.

The Democrat went on to predict that “sooner or later, leaders on both sides of the aisle will realise how much you are needed.”

Bono, a long term advocate for humanitarian aid across the world was announced as a surprise guest and held back tears as he recited a poem he had written to the agency.

He said: “They called you crooks. When you were the best of us.”

Donald Trump said he would “take a look” at deporting Elon Musk after the billionaire Tesla boss reignited their bitter feud.

Speaking to reporters at the White House, Mr Trump said his former ally was urging Republicans to vote against his tax and spending bill because he is upset about “losing his EV (electric vehicle) mandate”, adding that Mr Musk could “lose a lot more” than government subsidies afforded to Tesla.

Asked by reporters if he would consider deporting the South African-born businessman, Mr Trump said he would “take a look”.

The president had said earlier on Truth Social that Mr Musk would be forced to “close up shop and head back to South Africa” if he loses US government contracts.

The war of words came after Mr Musk intensified his criticism of Mr Trump's so-called “big, beautiful bill”, which pledges to slash taxes for the rich, make sweeping cuts to welfare programmes such as Medicaid, and remove incentives for Americans to buy electric cars.

Posting on X, Mr Musk said he would make it his mission to oust Republican senators who vote in favour of the legislation. The 54-year-old also threatened to put their faces on a poster, accusing them of being a “liar” and of “voting to increase America's debt” by $5 trillion.

Anyone who campaigned on the PROMISE of REDUCING SPENDING , but continues to vote on the BIGGEST DEBT ceiling increase in HISTORY will see their face on this poster in the primary next year pic.twitter.com/w13Qkm2e1A

The posts prompted a furious response from Mr Trump, who is pressuring senators to pass the legislation before his self-imposed deadline of July 4.

“Elon Musk knew, long before he so strongly Endorsed me for President, that I was strongly against the EV Mandate. It is ridiculous, and was always a major part of my campaign,” Mr Trump wrote.

He said that Mr Musk “may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far”, and that he would “probably have to head back home to South Africa” with them.

“No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE. Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!”

The president later said he could “put DOGE on Elon”, suggesting $38 billion of government contracts – which include SpaceX and Tesla – could be cut. “The monster that might have to go back and eat Elon. Wouldn't that be terrible?” he said.

He was referring to the Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting agency Mr Trump previously appointed Mr Musk to run.

The public exchange marks the collapse of a fragile truce between the pair several weeks ago, following a bitter row in which Mr Musk called for Mr Trump's impeachment and accused him of appearing in the Jeffrey Epstein files.

At the time, Mr Musk also threatened to form a rival political party, before later apologising.

That earlier dispute was also rooted in opposition to Mr Trump's “big, beautiful bill”, which will reverse a mandate that gave Americans an electric vehicle tax credit of up to $7,500, benefiting companies including Tesla.

Shares of Tesla dropped 6 per cent in the wake of the renewed row.

Mr Trump claimed last month that Mr Musk was “upset because we took the EV mandate – which, you know, was a lot of money for electric vehicles... They want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy”.

Mr Musk is understood to have spent at least $250 million supporting Mr Trump's re-election campaign, and was later appointed to lead the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, which made headlines after sacking around 120,000 federal employees.

Mr Musk, who stepped down as head of Doge last month, branded the tax bill a “disgusting abomination” for inflating the national debt. He has repeated his calls for the creation of a new “America Party” and pledged to fund it the day after the bill is passed.

He said: “How can you call yourself the Freedom Caucus if you vote for a DEBT SLAVERY bill with the biggest debt ceiling increase in history?”

Independent analysts have warned that the bill's spending cuts were not balanced by tax breaks, meaning it would add more than $2 trillion to the national debt during the next decade.

Even after an all-night session of amendment votes and wrangling behind closed doors, Senate Republicans still did not have enough support to pass their reconciliation package as of Tuesday morning, leaving party leaders scrambling to placate GOP holdovers who are purportedly nervous about the legislation's unprecedented cuts to Medicaid and federal nutrition assistance.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) argued in a social media post that the reason for the GOP's inability to quickly rally its own members around the legislation is straightforward: “Because it's a moral monstrosity.”

“We have been debating amendments for 21 hours and we are still going because through 12 hours of debate and 21 hours of amendment votes, Republicans still don't have 50 votes for their bill,” Murphy wrote at roughly 5:30 am ET, as the marathon “vote-a-rama” continued with no end in sight.

With Democrats unanimously opposed to the bill, Senate Republicans can only afford to lose three GOP votes if they are to send the measure back to the House for final approval. Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) have said they will vote against the bill in its current form, and Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) are undecided. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) also suggested he's on the fence.

Republican leaders have been working to bring Murkowski into the yes column with a proposal that would temporarily exempt Alaska and other states from the bill's massive cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), the top Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee, ripped the proposal as “absurd” and said it would reward the states with the highest SNAP error rates.

“Insanity reigns,” Klobuchar wrote on social media.

Senate Republicans' margins became more difficult after Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) announced his opposition to the legislation over the weekend, pointing to the Senate version's devastating cuts to Medicaid.

“What do I tell 663,000 people in two years or three years, when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the funding's not there anymore?” Tillis asked in a floor speech on Sunday, citing an estimate of the number of people in North Carolina who could lose health insurance under the Republican bill.

Throughout the country, nearly 12 million people would lose coverage under the Senate reconciliation bill, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

“Kicking millions off healthcare, blowing up the national debt by trillions, and devastating generational economic harms — all being written into law on the fly,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said early Tuesday morning after hours of debate and amendment votes.

Zohran Mamdani's grassroots-oriented model of political power remains incomprehensible to most political observers.

Zohran Mamdani's grassroots-oriented model of political power remains incomprehensible to most political observers.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

By now, much ink has been spilled and many takes have been shared on the resounding victory of Zohran Mamdani over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo last Tuesday in the New York City primary to become the presumptive Democratic nominee for mayor. There are many reasons for this win, including Mamdani's talents; his clear progressive message focusing on affordability in one of the most expensive cities in the country; and his excellent use of social media, earned media, and traditional ads.

Mamdani's plans were almost immediately denounced as “unrealistic” and pie in the sky by political commentators. The Atlantic suggested that his accessible, unified message of affordability — with key policies, such as free child care, free bus service, and rent freezes for New York City's 2 million rent-stabilized tenants — was a form of “magical realism.” Pundits and political elites repeatedly claimed that such universal affordability type policies did not speak to voters of color, but rather only appealed to highly educated white younger voters. Underlying the tired trope of the socialist “Bernie Bro” was the implicit idea that Mamdani's voter base would be limited only to college-educated transplants, out of touch with the experience of working-class communities of color.

Despite nearly universal opinions and polling data predicting a Cuomo victory, the underdog's victory last week revealed many of his advantages. Commentators have pointed to a plethora of explanations — Cuomo's toxicity and scandals, as well as Mamdani's charisma, political talent, clear messaging, and excellent social media strategy and ground game. The City called his tens of thousands of volunteers Mamdani's “army,” and according to the campaign, canvassers knocked on over 1 million doors.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

All of these factors undoubtedly contributed to Mamdani's win, but these were obvious factors prior to his upset victory. One factor of Mamdani's campaign that gets less attention is its grassroots nature, which goes beyond merely running an impressive ground game door-knocking operation; Mamdani's campaign is grassroots in its origins, its associations, its practice, and its theory of governance. The media does not quite understand this orientation, because most candidates and politicians are so divorced from the grassroots. The clarity of Mamdani's message and his unique talent may serve as an inspiration for other insurgents, as might his grassroots commitments.

While Mamdani's affordability agenda was mocked as unrealistic, and even out of touch with the working-class communities he needed to win the primary, this narrative ignores his “man on the street” style of campaigning that he began following Donald Trump's general election victory in November 2024. Specifically, Latino voters in the Bronx and Asian voters in Queens noticeably broke for Trump, compared to their voting behavior in 2020. Shortly after the 2024 election, Mamdani spoke with voters in the Bronx and Queens about why they chose to vote for Trump (or chose not to vote) and recorded their answers. The voters gave different responses: affordability, problems with the system, rent and food costs, general disappointment in the Democrats, and Israel's U.S.-backed genocide in Gaza. Absent were mentions of disliking immigrants (as these neighborhoods are diverse and immigrant heavy) or other so-called “woke” issues. Rather, this video captured a bottom-up desire for Democratic politicians to respond to people's immediate economic needs.

Mamdani's messaging came from countless conversations like the ones in the video. His unified message of affordability, universal programs, and solidarity wasn't just popular — it was also digestible and easy to understand. In response, Cuomo came prepared with a well-funded media campaign backed by super PACs, blanketing the airwaves with anti-Mamdani commercials and filling mailboxes with mailers, spending a record-breaking $25 million. But all this propaganda, which characterized Mamdani as dangerous and inexperienced, did not work. And part of this is because of the strength of the grassroots efforts, which went beyond canvassing.

Aaron Fernando is a member of New York City's chapter of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), a law student, and a volunteer for Mamdani's campaign. Fernando told Truthout, “With an electorate as large as New York City's, paid media like TV advertisements and mailers can get a campaign pretty far. And after [Kamala] Harris lost every swing state [in 2024] despite a gigantic field operation, many people declared that canvassing had become obsolete. But that's the wrong message to take away.”

The truth, Fernando says, is that while canvassing alone can't win large-scale elections, it can reinforce the messaging a campaign puts out and allow voters to “make the connection between the information about the candidate they've been hearing [about] and the smiling canvasser at their front door.” Canvassing can also reach unique populations, Fernando says, “like the Muslim and South Asian uncles and aunties that powered Zohran's victory.”

“Make no mistake,” Fernando concluded. “Zohran's operation of 50,000 volunteers and 1.5 million doors knocked — the end result of almost a decade of NYC-DSA's trial-and-error on our campaigns — was the difference in this election.”

In addition to the canvassing operation, Zohran Mamdani's campaign maintained strong connections to left and progressive political organizations, such as the Working Families Party, the New York City chapter of DSA, and youth climate organizations, such as TREEage and the Sunrise Movement. Many of these organizations endorsed early and provided the volunteer muscle to share the campaigns' message among diverse networks. The Mamdani campaign came out with its three key policies — free child care, buses, and rent freezes — but developed other policy platforms through collaboration with policy experts and grassroots organizations, many of which are grassroots Black and immigrant community-based.

Mamdani's dedication to openness, collaboration, and shared goals permeated his campaign. “A profound democratic sensibility extended through every aspect of the Zohran campaign — from the platform that focused on the issues that keep millions of working New Yorkers up at night; to the role played by millions of canvassing conversations with strangers about how to change our city; to the way that everyday people who had never been involved in politics before could get involved, build their skills, develop the campaign's strategy together, and become leaders,” Mamdani campaign volunteer Jeremy Cohan told Truthout.

“It's no wonder the establishment completely dismissed it, because it is totally foreign to how they operate, which is fundamentally based on treating working people as passive consumers to whom experts try to sell a political product dreamed up in a boardroom with millionaire and billionaire donors,” Cohan said. “Rather than catering to big donors, corporate consultants, and bloviating pundits, [the campaign] starts from the basic belief that most people in our society are made to feel powerless, that this is the basis of tremendous suffering — not to mention of fascist reaction — and that democracy must enfranchise and involve ordinary people on a deep level in taking control of their lives, their society, and their future.”

This message of hope and empowering everyday people, whether in their interactions with the mayoral candidate or through conversations with volunteers, created a stark contrast with the politics of fear and distrust that characterized the Cuomo campaign.

But perhaps the characteristic of the Mamdani campaign that is least understood by both professional pundits and Democratic leadership alike is the radical model of governance that informed Mamdani's tenure as an assemblymember, which has also been present in his campaign thus far. As part of the Socialist in Office co-governance committee, Mamdani, together with other socialist state legislators and city council members, has taken a social movement approach to governing, building power through mobilizing and empowering regular people to push for solutions at all levels of government. A 2022 article from The Nation noted how Mamdani helped constituents organize to solve municipal-level problems like requesting a traffic light at a busy intersection, even though he is a state-level legislator, because he treated constituent services as a way to build power and democratize local government. Even though the theory of change behind this co-governance model was clearly laid out in the article, somehow this grassroots-oriented model of political power remains incomprehensible to most political observers.

Mamdani was constantly dinged on only passing “three bills” during his time in the legislature and he never defended this record. Instead, he continued to stress his social movement, grassroots orientation to prove his effectiveness as an elected official, pointing out his organizing with indebted taxi drivers and their advocacy group, in which he engaged in a 15-day hunger strike to negotiate for city debt relief for taxi drivers. While not carrying any bills on eviction protections, working with housing activists, he was arrested for protesting the end of the COVID-era eviction moratorium in 2021. This broader movement helped pass historic “Good Cause” eviction protection in New York State in 2024. In collaboration with the Public Power campaign and DSA Ecosocialists, Mamdani and other DSA electeds rallied, marched, and organized to fight for New York's Build Public Renewables Act in 2023, touted as the country's biggest climate law. The legislation allowed for the building of publicly owned renewable energy infrastructure, although Mamdani was not listed as the bill's main sponsor. This is a non-comprehensive list that only scratches the surface of the grassroots governance that characterized Mamdani's time in the New York State Assembly. Rather than see himself as a politician at the top, this theory of governance sees electeds as playing an inside-outside strategy, clearly embedded in grassroots and social movements.

Mamdani's fellow socialist in office, New York State Assembly member and housing activist Marcela Mitaynes, told Truthout that the goal of the campaigns and socialists in office is to build movements and organizers, not just one-time voters and constituents. “[Current New York City Mayor Eric Adams] said, ‘Oh you can't have free buses, you can't tax the rich. That's on the state level.' But he doesn't understand how [our project] works. We are building the political community. …We are teaching people to do more and go beyond the typical political script,” Mitaynes said.

“In this next stage of the campaign, we'll be able to build that and that talk about governance and how it works, and then we'll be able to pass this legislation. This grassroots organizing means we can push people — city council members, state legislators — to pass the laws we want,” Mitaynes said. “To [most politicians], everything is transactional. You either have the political capital to do it or you don't. But we're building it, by building up this movement. No politician can do this by themselves. We need to join forces with the people. We can never beat the money thrown at us. That's why [we] focus on grassroots, bringing [in] people affected the most.”

When U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January 2025, many in Washington expected a rapid settlement to the war in Ukraine. On the campaign trail, Trump had boasted he could end the conflict in 24 hours. Although few analysts believed that specific promise, many speculated about the possible terms and timeline of an impending deal. The investment bank JPMorgan Chase, for example, claimed an agreement could be reached by June.

Yet as the weeks pass and diplomacy stagnates, it is becoming clear that no such resolution is imminent. As Ukraine's former Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba noted in Foreign Affairs in late May, neither Russia nor Ukraine “has much of an incentive to stop the fighting.” Ukraine refuses to surrender its sovereignty; Russia will not accept anything less than Ukrainian capitulation.

This conclusion, however, does not mean all is lost. Russia is much weaker economically than many analysts realize, and hard-hitting sanctions and export controls can still cripple its war economy. Ukraine is fighting smartly and could turn the tide on the battlefield with more high-end drones, air defense systems, long-range missiles, and munitions. With a change of strategy, Ukraine can still win the war in the near term—if both Europe and the United States decide to give it the assistance it needs.

Much of the premature optimism about a settlement earlier this year sprang from the prevailing belief that Ukraine was losing and would soon be forced to negotiate out of desperation. Trump stoked this narrative by asserting that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had “no cards” left to play. U.S. Vice President JD Vance took it a step further, declaring that Ukraine—and its foreign backers—never had any “pathway to victory.” Citing Russia's superiority in manpower and weapons, Vance argued that if the United States kept up its security assistance, it would only postpone Ukraine's inevitable defeat.

This defeatism has been supported by a second, equally pernicious assumption: that Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to subjugating Ukraine cannot be deterred. The former CIA analyst Peter Schroeder's assessment in Foreign Affairs last September exemplifies this view, describing Putin as “all in”—personally invested in keeping Ukraine from becoming a European democracy, no matter the cost. Such a narrative holds a kernel of truth, but it also dovetails too neatly with Russian propaganda. By assigning no agency to Ukraine or its foreign partners, it presumes that Ukrainian victory is a fantasy born of Western delusion, and it is a view that risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Both assumptions, meanwhile, rest on an excessively narrow reading of battlefield dynamics and a limited understanding of the policy options available to Ukraine's backers. Despite significant constraints on the aid that Europe and the United States have offered over the past three and a half years, Ukraine has achieved impressive victories. It repelled Russia's initial push toward Kyiv in March 2022 with little more than shoulder-fired antitank missiles and grit, defying the predictions of many military analysts. Later that year, in a stunning rout for Russian forces, Ukraine reclaimed nearly a thousand square miles in the Kharkiv region without the benefit of modern armor or air cover. And just weeks ago, Ukraine shocked the world by pulling off Operation Spiderweb, a surprise attack that used cheap, remote-controlled drones to inflict substantial damage on Russia's long-range aviation.

Indeed, what most consistently hindered Ukraine's war effort was not Kyiv's lack of manpower or weak resolve compared with Putin, but rather an insufficient supply of advanced military capabilities. Long after Russia had deployed its most modern tanks, fifth-generation fighter aircraft, long-range air defense systems, and cutting-edge ballistic and cruise missiles, Ukraine was still waiting for deliveries of similar capabilities from its Western partners. When some of these systems finally did arrive, Ukraine was prohibited from using them on targets inside Russia until the United States relaxed its rules of engagement in mid-2024. The truth is precisely the opposite of what the current administration has claimed. Instead of prolonging the war by giving Ukraine too much military assistance, Kyiv's foreign allies have prolonged it by giving too little, and often with significant delays. 

When it comes to punitive economic measures against Russia, the international response has been similarly half-baked. In the early days of the war, the United States and its G-7 allies crafted sanctions and export controls that were thought to pack a powerful punch but in fact had so many mitigations built in that they were robbed of their full impact. In April 2022, just after Russia's invasion, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union removed seven Russian banks from SWIFT, the dominant international payments system. Many analysts had previously touted the move as a “nuclear option” that would decimate the Russian economy.

But the delisting was so selective in its application—targeting only seven banks out of hundreds in Russia—that the Russian economy actually grew in 2023 and 2024. The gradual implementation of export controls also gave Russia time to adapt, as did numerous carve-outs for certain types of Russian banks or transactions: civil nuclear energy, aviation servicing and maintenance, and fertilizer sales, for example, could still be processed. As the saying goes, the dose makes the poison—and the insufficient dosing of punitive economic measures produced an underwhelming campaign with limited strategic effect.

Despite these missteps, victory for Ukraine—minimally defined as preserving its sovereignty and continuing to chart a course toward NATO and EU membership—is still squarely within reach. Achieving it, however, requires a fundamental shift in Western strategy, one that combines a large boost in military assistance with more robust economic measures to constrain Russia's war economy.

The linchpin for this new strategy is the West's mobilization of the approximately $300 billion in frozen Russian assets held in their jurisdictions—mostly in the EU—to support Ukraine's current fight. Thus far, the Trump administration has shown no inclination to use congressionally authorized funds to support Ukraine. So, as Wally Adeyemo and David Shimer have written in Foreign Affairs, it makes sense to seize these assets and, in effect, “make Russia pay” for Ukraine's defense. Some EU leaders have argued that these assets should be saved for reconstruction efforts after the war ends. Others worry about setting a dangerous precedent for the rule of law by seizing a country's funds—even if that country has violated international laws and is engaged in the mass murder of civilians. If Europe is to help bring this war to an end, it must set these concerns aside and act now.

These funds could serve multiple purposes. A portion could be invested in Ukraine's burgeoning defense industrial base: its drone sector, for instance, has become highly innovative but needs additional investments for industrial-scale production, sensor development, and counter-electronic warfare measures. Another portion could help Ukraine purchase long-range missiles and other weapons systems from Europe, assisting the continent in building up production lines that support both Ukraine's defense and, once the war is over, NATO deterrence. A third chunk could fund the production of U.S.-made capabilities—such as air defense systems and long-range precision fires—that Ukraine needs but Europe currently lacks in sufficient quantities. And finally, the remainder could go to distributed energy generation, the protection of critical infrastructure such as switchyards and electrical substations, and humanitarian needs.

Yet helping Ukraine win requires more than just transferring arms. Western governments must prioritize co-production agreements, intellectual property sharing, and defense manufacturing partnerships—especially in missile and ammunition manufacturing, armored vehicles, and drone and counterdrone technologies, as well as cyber, command and coordination systems, and electronic warfare systems. Such arrangements would reduce Ukraine's dependence on foreign supply chains, fortify its domestic capacity, and foster long-term interoperability with NATO forces. Equally important is for these governments to give Ukraine access to maintenance and life-cycle support technologies and software so that Western platforms can be adapted to the evolving battlefield.

Despite being outnumbered, Ukraine has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to offset its disadvantages with asymmetric tactics, such as sinking parts of Russia's Black Sea Fleet with maritime drones and missiles and denying Russia air superiority by using its limited air defenses creatively. With more sustained military, technological, and economic support, Ukraine could develop new advantages, such as better integrating drones, land mines, and long-range fires to pin down Russian forces and take out their logistics nodes.

To buttress Ukraine's military capabilities, the West must also target the economic foundations of Russia's war effort. Fortunately for Ukraine, Russia's economy remains fragile. Although the country's GDP has increased over the last two years, structural weaknesses abound in its economy: a 20 percent interest rate, a 68 percent decline in Russia's sovereign wealth fund since February 2022, and persistent inflation of around nine percent. These vulnerabilities present opportunities.

First, the West must go after Russia's primary revenue stream: energy exports. Currently, Europe is still importing roughly $23.5 billion worth of Russian oil and natural gas. If Europe is to get serious about ending the war, it must decrease Moscow's energy income and foreign currency flows. Moreover, Russia has systematically evaded the G-7's oil price cap, significantly weakening its intended impact. Western countries should impose a full embargo or steep tariffs on Russian oil and gas and should tighten regulations, engage in more systematic maritime tracking, and take stronger legal measures to strictly enforce the G-7 price cap. And if third parties flout these restrictions, the G-7 should impose sanctions on them.

The G-7 countries, meanwhile, must further isolate Russia financially. The Kremlin has taken advantage of the sanctions regime's carve-outs and has the power to direct Russian banks to process whatever payments are needed. To meaningfully disrupt Russia's trade, devalue the ruble, and increase economic uncertainty, the G-7 should remove all Russian banks from SWIFT and subject them to full blocking sanctions, which prohibit all transactions with the sanctioned entity. If financial institutions in foreign countries enable sanctions evasion, they, too, should be subjected to secondary sanctions. Only by applying the full power of these sanctions tools can Ukraine's allies succeed in weakening Russia's war machine.

Western governments can also redouble their efforts regarding export controls on high-tech components, including semiconductors, precision machine tools, optics, aviation components, and industrial software. There have been export controls on Russia for more than a decade, but these are not one-and-done solutions; meaningfully degrading the Kremlin's capacity to replenish and maintain its military equipment requires continuous enforcement whenever workarounds and third-party cutouts arise. The U.S. Commerce Department should further restrict Russia's access to “dual use” goods—products valuable in both civilian and military applications—in order to constrain its production of high-tech weapons and undermine its military-industrial complex. Similarly, Western governments can do more to zero in on Russia's defense industry by sanctioning more Russian firms that manufacture essential defense equipment such as drones, missiles, and armored vehicles.

Even after three and half years of full-scale war, Ukraine's supporters have not come close to exhausting the sanctions toolkit. If rigorously applied and internationally enforced, the combination of these sanction enhancements would cripple Russia's economy.

Yet it is also important to recognize that Russia is no longer waging this war alone. It has found steady backing from a coalition of autocratic states—backing that has allowed it to weather the bite of Western sanctions and replenish critical materiel. Only a few months into the war, Western intelligence agencies and military analysts had assessed that Russia had significantly depleted its stockpile of precision-guided munitions. As sanctions took hold and component shortages mounted, the Kremlin was forced to ration these weapons. This rationing had a real effect on the war, gradually turning the battlefield dynamics in Ukraine's favor. The tempo of Russian precision strikes declined markedly by late 2022, replaced in part by the use of unguided bombs and the repurposing of systems such as the S-300 air defense missile for ground-attack roles.

By the fall of that year, however, Iran began supplying Russia with drones. Then, by 2023, China emerged as Russia's primary supplier of dual-use technologies, including accounting for over 90 percent of imported microelectronics. North Korea, meanwhile, provided short-range ballistic missiles and, later, troops.

Confronting this axis of aggressors will require a shift in Western strategy. There is probably little Europe or the United States can do to dissuade North Korea, but Iran has been greatly weakened following its war with Israel and has less to offer now that Russia is mass-producing its own drones. That leaves China, whose inputs into the Russian defense industrial base are far more consequential than Iran's or North Korea's contributions. To constrain Chinese support for Moscow, a unified transatlantic approach is needed to raise the costs of Beijing's support. That means leveraging trade and market access—areas in which Europe holds unique influence—to apply pressure. European leaders acknowledge China's key role in enabling the Russian war effort, but they have not taken serious steps to stop it; mere expressions of disapproval are not enough. If the war in Ukraine is to be contained and ultimately resolved, Europe will have to make clear to Beijing that normal commercial relations cannot coexist with China's support for a war against the European security order.

Putin's ambition to dominate Ukraine is unlikely ever to diminish, even as Russian casualties approach a million. What can change are the battlefield and defense-industrial conditions that make Putin's ambition feasible. Western countries have the collective resources to create a situation in which trend lines turn negative for Russia. Once the strategic risks accumulate to the extent that the Kremlin has to ask difficult questions about Russia's ability to defend itself against other hostile actors, it will be compelled to reassess its approach.

Indeed, from a strategic vantage point, Russia has already lost this war. Regardless of how much additional territory changes hands, the Ukrainian nation is lost to Russia forever. No matter how many billions of dollars Moscow spends on propaganda and “reeducation,” filtration camps and torture chambers, it will never convince Ukrainians to accept its rule as legitimate. What Ukraine needs now is the time, tools, and space to prove to the Kremlin that an occupation is not just immoral but incompatible with Russia's long-term security needs.

Ukraine's allies have a choice. They can continue the current approach of transatlantic division and stillborn diplomacy, risking an expanded, longer, and far costlier war. Or they can act decisively to help Ukraine turn the tide, throttle the tempo of Russian weapons manufacturing, and empower the leadership in Kyiv to negotiate from a position of strength. A peace agreement may forever remain elusive, but once the cost of continued fighting becomes untenable, Russia can eventually be forced to settle for an armistice similar to the one that effectively ended the Korean War. Once that point is reached and the fighting diminishes, the space will emerge for Ukraine to renew its democratic mandate, resettle refugees, reconstruct infrastructure, and—perhaps most critically—finish its accession process with the EU and NATO. The return of all occupied territories may take longer, but Ukraine will have established the foundations of strategic victory.

Victory may not come quickly, cheaply, or easily. But it is still possible and will likely cost fewer lives and resources than a perpetuation of the status quo. What remains to be seen is whether the West—especially Europe—is willing to summon the political will to secure this brighter future.

 Damien Ma and Lizzi C. Lee

Competition between China and the United States has long been framed as a contest between two countries with opposite roles in the global economy: China as the world's leading producer and the United States as the world's leading consumer. Now, however, each country is attempting to become more like the other in a race to rebalance its economy. Can the United States substitute for lost production from China faster than China can substitute for lost consumption from the United States?

Uncertainty about the answer to this question has shaken Washington out of its complacency. In a recent Foreign Affairs essay, former U.S. officials Kurt Campbell and Rush Doshi warned against underestimating China and its industrial capacity. Diagnosing the United States' main deficiency as a lack of scale, which they defined as “the ability to use size to generate efficiency and productivity,” Campbell and Doshi argued that Washington must gather a team of allies to address this problem and compete with Beijing.

Assembling an economic Team America might help solve the scale problem, but it will not be enough. Scale alone won't yield the integrated supply chains the country will need to build the way China has built for the last three decades. To get there, the United States will also need to do the hard work of digging up raw materials, building infrastructure, and deploying technology inside its own borders.

If the United States wants to achieve results like China, it will have to build more like China by replicating certain aspects of how Beijing organizes and mobilizes its production economy, prioritizing speed and agglomeration. What Washington needs is an industrial policy with American characteristics.

An exemplar of China's model is its decades-long electrification push. When China launched its quest to deploy a nationwide electric-powered high-speed rail network around 20 years ago, it also needed to build the accompanying electrical infrastructure to accommodate the rail network. Later, Beijing's investment in electric vehicles further increased demand for electricity, prompting more updates to the grid and the construction of more infrastructure, such as charging stations. The creation of an electric vehicle industry catalyzed the emergence of an advanced electrification supply chain, including batteries, permanent magnets, and energy storage. At each stage of development, China invested not only in advanced technologies but also in its grid infrastructure—a decision that has proved fruitful.

China has achieved advanced electrification with astonishing speed in part because of government support and in part because of its competitive and vertically integrated firms. Consider the Chinese automaker BYD: the conglomerate's operations span the entire value chain, from securing raw materials to manufacturing batteries to producing electric vehicles. Similarly, leading Chinese solar companies such as LONGi and Trina Solar control each step of the supply chain in the manufacture of solar panels and their components. Vertical integration allows companies to rapidly iterate and optimize their processes to accelerate research and development, minimize supply disruptions, and reduce costs. As a result, solar panels are up to 65 percent cheaper to make in China than in the United States or Europe. The cost of lithium iron phosphate batteries, preferred by electric vehicle makers for their balance between power and efficiency, fell by 30 percent in 2024 alone. Industries adopt cheaper technologies more quickly, which in turn boosts production volumes and lowers costs for consumers—accelerating technological advancements.

In many cases, state support has dramatically shortened production cycles for energy technologies. Chinese central government and state-owned enterprises coordinate innovation, regulation, and deployment under a unified strategy. To develop an important next-generation nuclear technology, the small modular reactor, such firms partnered with universities to cultivate talent, directly funded labs to guide research, and aligned design and compliance timelines to speed up the regulatory process. As a result, China moved from conceptualizing to commercializing such reactors in just a decade—an unthinkable timeline in the U.S. regulatory environment.

China's model has also produced results in renewable energy. In 2024 alone, the country installed enough solar panels to produce approximately 280 gigawatts of energy, more than the entire U.S. solar capacity. China's solar capacity now exceeds one terawatt—enough to supply global demand through 2032. Partly as a result, China has more capacity to generate electricity than the United States and the European Union combined.

China's massive investment in electrification has positioned the country for success in a key front in its competition with Washington: artificial intelligence. Because AI data centers require uninterrupted baseload power, the outcome of the global AI race will depend in no small part on reliable access to large amounts of electricity. Although the United States has the most advanced chips to train frontier AI models, China is well ahead in deploying the electrification infrastructure necessary for the widespread adoption or diffusion of AI.

Another ingredient in China's recipe for manufacturing success is regional industrial clustering, a form of agglomeration in which businesses colocate to tap into concentrated labor pools and supplier networks. In this environment, firms can expand operations more quickly, increasing in value as they grow. In the Pearl River Delta, for example, the Chinese government designated special economic zones, built massive port and logistics infrastructure, and offered tax incentives to attract suppliers and assemblers. Firms benefit from reduced transaction costs and faster commercialization timelines, leading high-value manufacturers to concentrate in the zones. Companies such as Apple and the Chinese drone maker DJI, for example, have placed a significant portion of their supply chains in the region.

Industry clustering has also fueled the growth of electrification technology hubs across China. For more than a decade, China has fostered a hub dedicated to producing permanent magnets—which are used in electric vehicle motors, wind turbines, and sophisticated machines such as the F-35 fighter jet's electric drive systems—around Inner Mongolia's Baotou, a resource-rich city the government designated as a high-tech zone. As part of that designation, the government gave the Baotou-based China Northern Rare Earth High-Tech Company, the country's largest rare-earth producer, crucial access to rare-earth reserves as well as tax breaks and other incentives. Baotou is now home to a fully integrated rare-earth supply chain and seven of China's top ten magnet firms.

Similarly, in Anhui Province in eastern China, the city of Hefei has transformed from a poor backwater into a crucial hub for the electric vehicle industry. The local government coinvested with major electric vehicle companies and built a supplier park with housing and transit links. Software developers, advanced display vendors, and manufacturers have colocated in the city, creating a clustered automobile industry supply chain. Global automakers have taken notice. In 2024, Germany's Volkswagen invested $2.7 billion in its Hefei production and innovation center, reinforcing the city's emergence as a twenty-first-century Detroit.

China's model offers important lessons for U.S. policymakers embracing industrial policy for the first time in half a century. Although Silicon Valley once lived by the mantra “move fast and break things,” this principle has not transferred well to manufacturing. Moving fast in the world of atoms is much harder than in the world of bits. Unrealized projects from the Northeast Corridor's Gateway rail tunnel to California's high-speed rail no longer represent isolated failures but symptoms of a national malaise.

Policymakers should focus on developing industries in which the United States faces the most glaring scarcities. China boasts well over 150 lithium-ion battery megafactories, more than 1,000 solar manufacturers, and hundreds of permanent magnet producers of various sizes. As a result, China now produces 75 percent of batteries, 80 percent of solar panels, and 90 percent of permanent magnets globally. In contrast, the United States is home to only a single major manufacturer—whose scale pales in comparison with China's firms—in each of those sectors. These severe deficiencies cannot be remedied by allies but will require rapidly building a domestic production base.

Clustering can be an effective strategy for growing a producer base. Any effort to create clusters would require federal policymakers, who have historically left such choices to state governments and market forces, to step outside their comfort zones and designate regions with comparative advantages where supply chains can mature and technologies can commercialize. Over time, government-supported clusters would evolve into robust, self-sustaining industrial ecosystems. Policymakers can start with exploring opportunities to cluster around existing capacity in critical industries.

The Midwest, for example, could foster clustering around lithium-ion battery capacity. The critical minerals needed for batteries are abundant in the Midwest: the region holds substantial deposits of cobalt, copper, and even manganese, particularly around Lake Superior. The Chinese battery maker Gotion has already invested billions in Illinois and Michigan to build battery plants with the potential to create thousands of jobs. The United States could transform the Great Lakes region—once derided as a rust belt, similar to China's city of Hefei before its rebirth—into a “Battery Belt” stretching from Duluth, Minnesota, to Detroit, Michigan.



To create an integrated twenty-first-century electric vehicle supply chain in the United States, it will be necessary to cluster mining, manufacturing, and material science in proximity. But to make Midwest mining economically and politically feasible, policymakers will have to think big and be ready to spend. If the Trump administration follows through on its proposal to create a national sovereign wealth fund, Washington could use such a fund to support strategic industry hubs. The private sector, too, will need to invest in ramping up industrial capacity. Doing so might not produce immediate returns. But even venture capital firms, which have historically shown more interest in the high-tech sector than in extractive industries, now recognize the need to back mining. The firm Andreessen Horowitz, for example, has called for the United States to build a new kind of vertically integrated “national mining champion” to secure critical mineral resources.

With ample resources to mine and refine within its own borders, the United States has the capacity to become more self-reliant with respect to critical metals, including rare earths. Although allies may be able to supplement U.S. supplies, such efforts require slow and unwieldy coordination with countries in which production is often expensive. Even as the United States continues to work with allies, it must prioritize building its own capacity in various segments of the supply chain.

Yet simply designating clusters will be insufficient. The U.S. government must go further to become an agent of acceleration. Streamlining compliance and cutting environmental review timelines are necessary first steps, but Congress must also give federal agencies such as the Departments of Energy and Transportation the authority to accelerate project timelines: for example, there is no reason that it should take more than a decade to build a nuclear power plant, as it currently does. Executive agencies should collaborate to establish “green lanes” to streamline permitting for strategic industrial projects in designated clusters. Governors and mayors in turn must work with federal counterparts to create task forces that can fast-track utility, land-use, and workforce arrangements.

The United States cannot and should not organize its economy exactly like China's. It would be prudent, however, for Washington to learn from the world's manufacturing colossus. Borrowing best practices from competitors is not without precedent: at the height of Japan's challenge to U.S. industry in the 1980s, the United States leaned in to competition while also adopting elements of the Japanese approach. U.S. auto manufacturers adopted Toyota's inventory management practices—for example, organizing supply and production “just in time” to meet demand, minimizing factory stockpiles—and American business schools embraced the concept.

Underestimating China would be a grave error, but underestimating the United States would be equally foolish. History has shown that when properly mobilized, the United States can retool with astonishing speed and ingenuity. Nearly a century ago, the country completed the Hoover Dam ahead of schedule and under budget. The United States' dynamic innovation system—renowned research institutions, deep and open capital markets, and high concentrations of global talent—remains an enduring advantage. It is arguably easier for the United States to build like China than it is for China to innovate like the United States.

To convert these advantages into productive capacity, the United States should selectively emulate today's preeminent manufacturing powerhouse and rediscover its own ability to build fast and build well. The U.S. government must make industrial investment attractive once again, not only to businesses but also to investors, workers, and communities.

Reindustrialization is not about nostalgia but about renewal. The United States can no longer rest on its reputation as the country that invents the future but must build the infrastructure and deploy the technologies to deliver that future. The United States does not need to become China—nor is that even possible. But China has grasped a crucial point: economic prosperity for future generations hinges on investing in a twenty-first-century industrial base. Now, it is time for the United States to do the same.

Follow:


            Astronomers in Australia picked up a strange radio signal in June 2024 — one near our planet and so powerful that, for a moment, it outshined everything else in the sky. The ensuing search for its source has sparked new questions around the growing problem of debris in Earth's orbit.
    


            At first, though, the researchers thought they were observing something exotic.
    


            “We got all excited, thinking we had discovered an unknown object in the vicinity of the Earth,” said Clancy James, an associate professor at Curtin University's Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy in Western Australia.
    


            The data James and his colleagues were looking at came from the ASKAP radio telescope, an array of 36 dish antennas in Wajarri Yamaji Country, each about three stories tall. Normally, the team would be searching the data for a type of signal called a “fast radio burst” — a flash of energy blasting forth from distant galaxies.
    


            “These are incredibly powerful explosions in radio (waves) that last about a millisecond,” James said. “We don't know what's producing them, and we're trying to find out, because they really challenge known physics — they're so bright. We're also trying to use them to study the distribution of matter in the universe.”
    


            Astronomers believe these bursts may come from magnetars, according to James. These objects are very dense remnants of dead stars with powerful magnetic fields. “Magnetars are utterly, utterly insane,” James said. “They're the most extreme things you can get in the universe before something turns into a black hole.”

            But the signal seemed to be coming from very close to Earth — so close that it couldn't be an astronomical object. “We were able to work out it came from about 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles) away. And we got a pretty exact match for this old satellite called Relay 2 — there are databases that you can look up to work out where any given satellite should be, and there were no other satellites anywhere near,” James said.
    


            “We were all kind of disappointed at that, but we thought, ‘Hang on a second. What actually produced this anyway?'”
    


            NASA launched Relay 2, an experimental communications satellite, into orbit in 1964. It was an updated version of Relay 1, which lifted off two years earlier and was used to relay signals between the US and Europe and broadcast the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.
    


            Just three years later, with its mission concluded and both of its main instruments out of order, Relay 2 had already turned into space junk. It has since been aimlessly orbiting our planet, until James and his colleagues linked it to the weird signal they detected last year.
    


            But could a dead satellite suddenly come back to life after decades of silence?
    


            To try to answer that question, the astronomers wrote a paper on their analysis, set to publish Monday in the journal The Astrophysical Journal Letters.
    


            They realized the source of the signal wasn't a distant galactic anomaly, but something close by, when they saw that the image rendered by the telescope — a graphical representation of the data — was blurry.
    


            “(T)he reason we were getting this blurred image was because (the source) was in the near field of the antenna — within a few tens of thousands of kilometers,” James said. “When you have a source that's close to the antenna, it arrives a bit later on the outer antennas, and it generates a curved wave front, as opposed to a flat one when it's really far away.”
    


            This mismatch in the data between the different antennas caused the blur, so to remove it, the researchers eliminated the signal coming from the outer antennas to favor only the inner part of the telescope, which is spread out over about 2.3 square miles in the Australian outback.
    


            “When we first detected it, it looked fairly weak. But when we zoomed in, it got brighter and brighter. The whole signal is about 30 nanoseconds, or 30 billionths of a second, but the main part is just about three nanoseconds, and that's actually at the limit of what our instrument can see,” James said. “The signal was about 2,000 or 3,000 times brighter than all the other radio data our (instrument) detects — it was by far the brightest thing in the sky, by a factor of thousands.”
    


            The researchers have two ideas on what could have caused such a powerful spark. The main culprit was likely a buildup of static electricity on the satellite's metal skin, which was suddenly released, James said.
    


            “You start with a buildup of electrons on the surface of the spacecraft. The spacecraft starts charging up because of the buildup of electrons. And it keeps charging up until there's enough of a charge that it short-circuits some component of the spacecraft, and you get a sudden spark,” he explained. “It's exactly the same as when you rub your feet on the carpet and you then spark your friend with your finger.”
    


            A less likely cause is the impact of a micrometeorite, a space rock no bigger than 1 millimeter (0.039 inches) in size: “A micrometeorite impacting a spacecraft (while) traveling at 20 kilometers per second or higher will basically turn the (resulting) debris from the impact into a plasma — an incredibly hot, dense gas,” James said. “And this plasma can emit a short burst of radio waves.”
    


            However, strict circumstances would need to come into play for this micrometeorite interaction to occur, suggesting there's a smaller chance it was the cause, according to the research. “We do know that (electrostatic) discharges can actually be quite common,” James said. “As far as humans are concerned, they're not dangerous at all. However, they absolutely can damage a spacecraft.”
    


            Because these discharges are difficult to monitor, James believes the radio signal event shows that ground-based radio observations could reveal “weird things happening to satellites” — and that researchers could employ a much cheaper, easier-to-build device to search for similar events, rather than the sprawling telescope they used. He also speculated that because Relay 2 was an early satellite, it might be that the materials it's made of are more prone to a buildup of static charge than modern satellites, which have been designed with this problem in mind.
    


            But the realization that satellites can interfere with galactic observations also presents a challenge and adds to the list of threats posed by space junk. Since the dawn of the Space Age, almost 22,000 satellites have reached orbit, and a little more than half are still functioning. Over the decades, dead satellites have collided hundreds of times, creating a thick field of debris and spawning millions of tiny fragments that orbit at speeds of up to 18,000 miles per hour.
    


            “We are trying to see basically nanosecond bursts of stuff coming at us from the universe, and if satellites can produce this as well, then we're going to have to be really careful,” James said, referring to the possibility of confusing satellite bursts with astronomical objects. “As more and more satellites go up, that's going to make this kind of experiment more difficult.”
    


            James and his team's analysis of this event is “comprehensive and sensible,” according to James Cordes, Cornell University's George Feldstein Professor of Astronomy, who was not involved with the study. “Given that the electrostatic discharge phenomenon has been known for a long time,” he wrote in an email to CNN, “I think their interpretation is probably right. I'm not sure that the micrometeoroid idea, pitched in the paper as an alternative, is mutually exclusive. The latter could trigger the former.”

            Ralph Spencer, Professor Emeritus of Radio Astronomy at the University of Manchester in the UK, who was also not involved with the work, agrees that the proposed mechanism is feasible, noting that spark discharges from GPS satellites have been detected before.
    


            The study illustrates how astronomers must take care to not confuse radio bursts from astrophysical sources with electrostatic discharges or micrometeoroid bursts, both Cordes and Spencer pointed out.
    


            “The results show that such narrow pulses from space may be more common than previously thought, and that careful analysis is needed to show that the radiation comes from stars and other astronomical objects rather than man-made objects close to the Earth,” Spencer added in an email.

            Lara Trump, President Donald Trump's daughter-in-law, is the leading potential candidate to run for Senate from North Carolina with Donald Trump's backing, multiple sources tell CNN.
    


            Sen. Thom Tillis' announcement that he won't seek reelection next year opens a prize opportunity for North Carolina Republicans. Multiple Trump allies looking to enter the race have begun reaching out to the president's aides, potentially seeking an endorsement that would all but lock out other challengers in a GOP primary.
    


            But Lara Trump, the former Republican National Committee co-chair and a key campaign surrogate last year, has the right of first refusal on an endorsement by her father-in-law, those sources say. Should she decide not to run, Republicans aligned with Donald Trump plan to conduct a full assessment of candidate possibilities in a race Democrats will contest as a potential opportunity to cut into the GOP's majority.
    


            “It would be great for her to run,” one source who has spoken to the president about the prospect told CNN.
    


            A source familiar with Lara Trump's thinking said she's been fielding calls from Republicans encouraging her to run and is considering it.
    


            “There is a lot for her to factor into this decision, like losing time with her kids,” the source said, noting that she had taken those factors into consideration when weighing running for Senate from North Carolina in 2022 and from Florida last year when then-Sen. Marco Rubio was nominated for secretary of state.
    


            Lara Trump is a native of North Carolina and a graduate of North Carolina State University.
    


            “There are a ton of conversations happening in every direction, but the reality is everything hinges on the decision Lara Trump makes,” said Republican strategist and North Carolina native Doug Heye.
    


            Some other potential candidates have already begun scheduling meetings in the meantime with the White House, including Rep. Pat Harrigan.
    


            Michael Whatley, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, has also expressed interest privately about a potential Senate run, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            Whatley has a close relationship with the Trump administration and political machine after Trump endorsed the former North Carolina Republican Party Chairman to succeed Ronna McDaniel as Republican National Committee chair. Trump promoted Lara Trump for the role of co-chair of the RNC at the same time.
    


            Reps. Richard Hudson and Brad Knott are also considered contenders for a Trump endorsement.
    


            “If she declines, I was told the president will decide between Whatley, Harrigan and Knott,” said one source who has closely worked with Republicans at all levels in North Carolina.
    


            Heye noted that despite her roots in the state, Lara Trump would be running her first campaign in a state Democrats see as a prime pickup opportunity.
    


            “We know she's good on TV, we know she can raise money. How will she be on the stump when she goes to New Bern? How aggressively will she be campaigning? We call them first-time candidates for a reason, because they are untested,” added Heye.
    


            However, Raleigh-based Republican consultant Jonathan Felts says he's seen Lara Trump's campaign chops up close.
    


            “We looked at Lara early in 2022, in the race to replace (former Sen. Richard) Burr, and we've stayed in contact with her over the years,” said Felts, who served as the senior adviser to the eventual GOP candidate and winner of that Senate seat, Ted Budd.
    


            “I think people might be surprised,” he said. “She genuinely connects with grassroots audiences. People here have home-state pride in her. She'll be a legitimate candidate if she decides to run.”

Follow:


            The British royal family's train will be retired by 2027, as part of a cost-saving measure announced by Buckingham Palace on Monday after “a thorough review into its use and value for money.”
    


            The monarchy has been using its own rail travel since Queen Victoria first boarded a specially built carriage from Slough, England, to London Paddington Station in 1842. The current royal train, which has nine carriages that include sleeping quarters and an office, was introduced in 1977 for Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee.
    


            But the costs of royal rail travel rack up quickly, according to the Royal Household's annual accounts report, which showed that a visit by the King to the English county of Staffordshire in February cost £44,822 ($61,800). Another trip to the Cheshire headquarters of luxury automaker Bentley last year cost more than £33,000 ($45,700). There are also hefty costs associated with storing the royal train at a secure facility in Wolverton, England.

            The decision to decommission the train was partly due to “the significant level of investment which would be required to keep the Royal Train in operation beyond 2027,” the report said. Meanwhile, two helicopters provide “a reliable alternative,” it stated. The royals took more than 140 helicopter journeys over the year, with an average cost per trip of around £3,370 ($4,600).
    


            The announcement of the train's retirement was part of the annual financial statement released by the British Royal Household, which revealed that the annual lump sum it received from the government remained at £86.3 million ($118.50 million).
    


            The sum, called the Sovereign Grant, pays for the upkeep of royal palaces and the royals' official duties and is funded by British taxpayer money. In return, the monarch hands over all profits from the Crown Estate — which includes vast swathes of central London property, the Ascot Racecourse and the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland — to the government, in an arrangement dating back to 1760.
    


            The Sovereign Grant functions like an expense account for the monarch and their representatives, covering the costs of their public duties, including travel, staff, and upkeep of historic properties. Notably, it excludes funding for security, which also incurs a high cost given the royals' numerous public engagements and events.
    


            Royal family members undertook more than “1,900 public engagements in the UK and overseas, while more than 93,000 guests attended 828 events at Official Royal Palaces,” the annual Sovereign Grant Report said. 



            The total grant of £86.3 million ($118.50 million), which by law remains the same as the three previous financial years, is comprised of a £51.8 million ($71.1 million), core grant and £34.5 million ($47.4 million) to fund the refurbishment of Buckingham Palace.
    


            Buckingham Palace, a top tourist attraction in central London, is undergoing a major modernization project that will see upgrades to electric cabling, pipework, elevators and accessible bathrooms.
    


            The report also said the Royal Household will increase its use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and continue the electrification of its fleet of vehicles.

            Last year, the Royal Household announced it aimed to transition to an “almost fully electric” fleet of vehicles, without providing a target date. Britain's PA Media reported that the King's two Bentleys would be modified to run on biofuel.
    


            The royal family's three main sources of income are the Sovereign Grant, the Duchy of Lancaster and Duchy of Cornwall estates and their personal property and investments.
    


            The level of funding for the British royal family has long fueled criticism, with one anti-monarchy group calling for the Sovereign Grant to be abolished and for the British public to keep all the profits of the Crown Estate.
    


            “The grant system is mad. Funding goes up not because of any need for extra money, but because the grant is linked to government profits from land managed by the Crown Estate,” Graham Smith, a campaigner for the group Republic, said in a statement earlier this year. “The palace has recycled the excuse of needing the money for refurbishment of Buckingham Palace, an excuse used to double the grant ten years ago.”
    


            “It's time that half a billion pounds was put to good use, that there was proper accounting for the cost of the monarchy and for that cost to be slashed to just a few million pounds,” Smith added.
    


            The Keeper of the Privy Purse, James Chalmers, said in a statement on Monday as the report was released: “Soft power is hard to measure but its value is, I believe, now firmly understood at home and abroad, as the core themes of the new reign have come into even sharper focus, and the Royal Family have continued in their service to the nation, Realms and Commonwealth.”

            President Donald Trump is threatening to impose higher tariffs on Japanese exports to the United States over what he claims is the country's unwillingness to buy American-grown rice.
    


            “They won't take our RICE, and yet they have a massive rice shortage. In other words, we'll just be sending them a letter, and we love having them as a Trading Partner for many years to come,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.
    


            Trump's claim that Japan “won't take” rice from the US isn't true. The country bought $298 million worth of rice from the US last year, according to US Census Bureau trade data. Between January and April of this year, Japan bought $114 million worth of rice.
    


            However, it's unclear if Japanese officials involved in ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries have said they will stop buying rice from the US in the future. On Tuesday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said that trade talks between the two sides are ongoing, and that the Japanese government is aware of Trump's claim, though he declined to comment on it.
    


            “While we refrain from disclosing the specifics of our discussions with the US, Japan will continue to vigorously pursue sincere and honest discussions with the aim of achieving an agreement that will benefit both Japan and the US,” he said.
    


            A 2021 report published by the Office of the United States Trade Representative under former President Joe Biden stated that “Japan's highly regulated and nontransparent system of importation and distribution for rice limits the ability of US exporters to have meaningful access to Japan's consumers.” A source familiar with Trump's thinking told CNN that's what he was referring to in his post.
    


            Trump has said recently that his administration plans to send some foreign countries letters advising them of what their new tariff rates could be, following the pause of his April “reciprocal” tariffs on US trading partners.
    


            And in a Fox News interview that aired on Sunday, Trump singled out Japan as one of the possible countries set to receive a letter.
    


            “Dear Mr. Japan, here's the story: You're going to pay a 25% tariff on your cars,” he said.
    


            Trump's Truth Social message comes with just days to go until the July 9 deadline when his 90-day pause on those “reciprocal” tariffs expires. It's unclear what will happen to tariff rates for the dozens of impacted countries.
    


            Before Trump announced the pause, Japanese exports were briefly subjected to a minimum tariff rate of 24%. Since the pause went in effect, they've been subject to the universal 10% rate.
    


            White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on Monday suggested that negotiations with Japan are ongoing.
    


            “Nothing is over,” Hassett told reporters at the White House. “I know what he just posted, but there'll still be discussions right up till the end. Even if we get a framework, then there's still gonna be things to finalize.”

LONDON (AP) — Three senior leaders at the English hospital where nurse Lucy Letby was convicted of murdering seven babies and trying to kill seven others were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, police said Tuesday.

The unnamed suspects being investigated for gross negligence manslaughter were arrested after a corporate manslaughter probe was expanded following Letby's 2023 convictions for the infant deaths at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England, said Detective Superintendent Paul Hughes of the Cheshire Constabulary. The three were released on bail.

“This focuses on senior leadership and their decision-making to determine whether any criminality has taken place concerning the response to the increased levels of fatalities,” Hughes said.

Letby, 35, is serving multiple life sentences after being convicted of seven counts of murder and attempting to murder seven other infants between June 2015 and June 2016 while working as a neonatal nurse at the hospital.

Prosecutors said she harmed babies in ways that left little trace, including injecting air into their bloodstreams, administering air or milk into their stomachs through nasogastric tubes, poisoning them with insulin and interfering with breathing tubes.




Letby, who testified that she never harmed a child, has continued to proclaim her innocence and support for her has grown as legal and scientific experts have questioned the circumstantial and statistical evidence used at her trial. A panel of international medical experts disputed the evidence against her and her lawyer said she was wrongly convicted.

A judge who oversaw a public inquiry seeking accountability of staff and management at the hospital is expected to publish her findings this fall. Justice Kathryn Thirlwall said at the outset of the inquiry that she would not review Letby's conviction, but take a deeper look into how failures led babies to repeatedly be harmed at the hospital.

As that inquiry was underway earlier this year, an independent panel of more than a dozen medical experts issued a report that found no sign of a crime and concluded natural causes or bad medical care led to the demise of each of the newborns.

“In summary, then, ladies and gentlemen, we did not find any murders,” Dr. Shoo Lee, a retired neonatologist from Canada, said at a London news conference in February. 

Letby's lawyers and three former executives at the hospital unsuccessfully petitioned Thirlwall to halt the public inquiry after the medical panel released its findings. They argued that if the convictions are overturned, the inquiry might reach the wrong conclusions and waste more than 10 million pounds ($13.8 million) in taxpayer funds.

Letby, who lost two bids to appeal her convictions, now has her case before the Criminal Case Review Commission, which reviews possible miscarriages of justice and could lead to one another shot at an appeal.

The Crown Prosecution Service has said two juries convicted Letby and three appellate judges had rejected her arguments that the prosecution expert evidence was flawed.

While the medical panel said there was no evidence Letby intentionally harmed any babies, they did find that medical workers at the hospital were not properly skilled in resuscitation and inserting breathing tubes, lacked an understanding of some basic procedures, misdiagnosed ailments and acted slowly in treating acutely ill babies.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland will temporarily reinstate border controls with neighboring Germany and Lithuania, in response to border restriction taken by Germany to discourage asylum-seekers, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Tuesday. 

The decision comes after new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz made tougher migration policy a pillar of his election campaign in February. After he took office in May, Germany stationed more police at the border and said some asylum-seekers trying to enter Europe's biggest economy would be turned away.

Even before that, Merz's predecessor in February had extended by six months the border checks Germany had imposed on all its frontiers last fall as it attempted to cut the number of migrants arriving in the country. 

Tusk said that “the German side refuses to allow migrants to enter its territory. ... The change in practice introduced tensions and a sense of asymmetry,” according to Polish state broadcaster TVP.

He said he had discussed the issue with Merz, “informing him that the patient position of Poland is slowly being exhausted.” 

The European Union has a visa-free travel area known as Schengen that allows citizens of most member states to travel easily across borders for work and pleasure. Switzerland also belongs to Schengen although it is not an EU member.

According to the EU, member states are allowed to temporarily reintroduce border controls in cases of a serious threat, like internal security. It says border controls should be applied as a last resort in exceptional situations, and must be limited in time.




In the past, Tusk has repeatedly denounced Germany's temporary border measures as “unacceptable.” 

Several of Germany's neighbors have also recently expressed dismay at the enforced border controls by Berlin, saying it slows down cross-border traffic of daily commuters and threatens visa-free Schengen travel.

Tusk said Tuesday the temporary measures will come into force on Monday, the Polish news agency PAP reported. 

Just before Tusk's announcement, Merz had told reporters at a press conference in Berlin that his government was in very close contact with the Polish government to keep the impact of Germany's border controls with Poland “as low as possible.”

Germany's government coordinator for German-Polish relations and cross-border cooperation expressed concern about the German-Polish border controls.

“The German border controls are necessary as a political signal that migration policy in Germany has changed,” Knut Abraham told the German daily Welt. “But we can also see that the controls are putting a massive strain on coexistence in the border region.”

“The solution cannot be to push migrants back and forth between Poland and Germany or to cement border controls on both sides,” he said.

BERLIN (AP) — A man suspected of gathering information on Jewish locations and individuals in Berlin for Iranian intelligence, possibly with a view to attacks, has been arrested in Denmark, German prosecutors said Tuesday.

The Danish national, identified only as Ali S. in line with German privacy rules, was arrested on Thursday in the Danish city of Aarhus, federal prosecutors said in a statement.

The man was tasked by an Iranian intelligence service early this year with gathering information on “Jewish localities and specific Jewish individuals” in Berlin, prosecutors said. They didn't elaborate.

He spied on three properties in June, “presumably in preparation of further intelligence activities in Germany, possibly including terrorist attacks on Jewish targets,” prosecutors said.

German Justice Minister Stefanie Hubig said that “if this suspicion is confirmed, we are dealing with an outrageous operation,” adding in a statement that “the protection of Jewish life has the highest priority for the German government.”

German security authorities stepped up protection for Jewish and Israeli facilities after a 12-day war broke out between Israel and Iran in June.

The suspect is accused of working for an intelligence service of a foreign power. The information leading to his arrest came from Germany's domestic intelligence service, prosecutors said.

He will be brought before a judge in Germany to determine whether he's kept in custody pending formal charges after extradition from Denmark. It wasn't immediately clear when that will happen.




Iranian Ambassador Majid Nili Ahmadabadi was summoned to the German Foreign Ministry after prosecutors announced the arrest.

The Iranian Embassy in Berlin rejected what it called “unfounded and dangerous allegations” of an apparent plan for an attack on Jewish facilities. It said in an emailed statement that they “appear to be part of a deliberate campaign” to divert attention from “the recent aggression of the Israeli regime against Iranian territory” and the killing of Iranians. 

Germany is a staunch ally of Israel and has a history of tense relations with Tehran, though it has been one of the three leading European powers trying to engage Iran in diplomacy over its nuclear program. 

In October, Germany ordered the closure of all three Iranian Consulates in the country in response to the Iranian judiciary's announcement of the execution of Iranian German prisoner Jamshid Sharmahd, who lived in the United States and was kidnapped in Dubai in 2020 by Iranian security forces. That left the Islamic Republic with only its embassy in Berlin.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Former Texas congressman Colin Allred launched another run for the U.S. Senate on Tuesday after the Democrat's challenge against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz last year broke records for spending but did not deliver his party the breakthrough it has sought for decades in the state.

This time, Allred is seeking the seat of Republican Sen. John Cornyn, who is facing a primary challenge from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in what is likely to be one of the GOP's most contentious contests in 2026.

Allred's announcement comes just seven months after he lost by nearly 9 percentage points to Cruz. That race was one of the most expensive in the country last cycle, with Democrats spending more than $130 million trying to unseat Cruz.

A former NFL linebacker and attorney, Allred is the first high-profile Democrat to declare himself a candidate in the race that Democrats see as their best shot next year at ending a 30-year drought in statewide elections in Texas. Another former Democratic congressman, Beto O'Rourke, who came within 3 percentage points of defeating Cruz in 2018, also hasn't ruled out a run.

In a video announcing his candidacy, Allred took aim at both Cornyn and Paxton and cast himself as a fighter for those struggling to get ahead.

“I get it. Real change might feel impossible,” Allred said. “But I'm not giving up.”

In response to the announcement, Paxton criticized Allred's positions on immigration and LGBTQ issues.




“Texans have already rejected your liberal values once,” the attorney general said Tuesday on X. “Now it's time for Texas voters to say no to your vision and values once more.”

Allred tried to position himself as a moderate in last year's race and made protecting abortion rights a centerpiece of his campaign. His supporters included Texas women who had serious pregnancy complications after the state's abortion ban took effect.

But his campaign drew criticism early on from some Democrats who grew restless with Allred's strategy of not packing his schedule with raucous rallies or investing more in smaller corners of Texas, including cities along the border with Mexico.

In the end, Texas Democrats' streak of losses in statewide races continued while Republicans kept making gains along the predominately Hispanic border with Mexico, which had long been a Democratic stronghold. 

Allred played four seasons in the NFL, all with the Tennessee Titans, after being undrafted out of Baylor University. He entered Congress after flipping a Republican district in Dallas in 2018. 

Former astronaut Terry Virts also entered the U.S. Senate race as a Democratic candidate. 

Looming over the GOP primary between Cornyn and Paxton is whether and when President Donald Trump will make an endorsement. In April, Trump praised both candidates and said he would make a decision later.

NEW YORK (AP) — Zohran Mamdani has won New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, a new vote count confirmed Tuesday, cementing his stunning upset of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and sending him to the general election. 

The Associated Press called the race after the results of the city's ranked choice voting tabulation were released and showed Mamdani trouncing Cuomo by 12 percentage points.

In a statement, Mamdani said he was humbled by the support he received in the primary and started turning his attention to the general election. 

“Last Tuesday, Democrats spoke in a clear voice, delivering a mandate for an affordable city, a politics of the future, and a leader unafraid to fight back against rising authoritarianism,” he said. “I am humbled by the support of more than 545,000 New Yorkers who voted for our campaign and am excited to expand this coalition even further as we defeat Eric Adams and win a city government that puts working people first.”

Mamdani's win had been widely expected since he took a commanding lead after the polls closed a week ago, falling just short of the 50% of the vote needed to avoid another count under the city's ranked choice voting model. The system allows voters' other preferences to be counted if their top candidate falls out of the running.

Mamdani, who declared victory the night of the June 24 primary, will face a general election field that includes incumbent Mayor Eric Adams as well as independent candidate Jim Walden and Republican Curtis Sliwa. 






Cuomo conceded defeat just hours after the polls closed last week but is contemplating whether to run in the general election on an independent ballot line. After the release of Tuesday's vote count, Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi said “We'll be continuing conversations with people from all across the city while determining next steps.”

“Extremism, division and empty promises are not the answer to this city's problems, and while this was a look at what motivates a slice of our primary electorate, it does not represent the majority,” Azzopardi said. “The financial instability of our families is the priority here, which is why actionable solutions, results and outcomes matter so much.”

Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist and member of the state Assembly, was virtually unknown when he launched his candidacy centered on a bold slate of populist ideas. But he built an energetic campaign that ran circles around Cuomo as the older, more moderate Democrat tried to come back from the sexual harassment scandal that led to his resignation four years ago.

The results, even before they were finalized, sent a shockwave through the political world.

Mamdani's campaign, which was focused on lowering the cost of living, claims it has found a new blueprint for Democrats who have at times appeared rudderless during President Donald Trump's climb back to power.

The Democratic establishment has approached Mamdani with caution. Many of its big players applauded his campaign but don't seem ready to throw their full support behind the young progressive, whose past criticisms of law enforcement, use of the word “genocide” to describe the Israeli government's actions in Gaza and “democratic socialist” label amount to landmines for some in the party.

If elected, Mamdani would be the city's first Muslim mayor and its first of Indian American decent. He would also be one of its youngest.

For Republicans, Mamdani has already provided a new angle for attack. Trump and others in the GOP have begun to launch broadsides at him, moving to cast Mamdani as the epitome of leftist excess ahead of consequential elections elsewhere this year and next.

“If I'm a Republican, I want this guy to win,” said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University. “Because I want to be able to compare and contrast my campaign as a Republican, in a national election, to the idea of, ‘This is where the Democratic party is.'”

New York City's ranked choice voting model allows voters to list up to five candidates on their ballots in order of preference. If a single candidate is the first choice of more than 50% of voters, then that person wins the race outright. Since no candidate cleared that bar on the night of the primary, the ranked choice voting process kicked in. The board is scheduled to certify the election on July 15.

Mamdani has been a member of the state Assembly since 2021, and has characterized his inexperience as a potential asset. His campaign promised free city buses, free child care, a rent freeze for people living in rent-stabilized apartment, government-run grocery stores and more, all paid for with taxes on the wealthy. Critics have slammed his agenda as politically unrealistic.

Cuomo ran a campaign centered on his extensive experience, casting himself as the only candidate capable of saving a city he said had spun out of control. During the campaign, he focused heavily on combating antisemitism and leaned on his name recognition and juggernaut fundraising operation rather than mingling with voters.

Confronted with the sexual harassment allegations that ended his tenure as governor, he denied wrongdoing, maintaining that the scandal was driven by politics and that voters were ready to move on.

Cuomo did not remove his name from the November ballot last week, ahead of a procedural deadline to do so, and has said he is still considering whether to mount an actual campaign for the office.

Adams, while still a Democrat, is running in the November election as an independent. He dropped out of the Democratic primary in April after he was severely wounded by his now-dismissed federal bribery case. Though he had done little in the way of campaigning since then, he reignited his reelection operation in the days after Mamdani declared victory, calling it a choice between a candidate with a “blue collar” and one with a “silver spoon.”

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — The fate of Argentina's state-run oil company was thrown into doubt Monday as a U.S. judge ordered the cash-strapped country to give up its 51% controlling stake in YPF in partial compensation for seizing the shares of former investors during its 2012 nationalization of the energy group.

The ruling — a dramatic effort to enforce a $16 billion U.S. court judgement against Argentina — presents a new headache for libertarian President Javier Milei, the ideological foil for left-wing former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner who oversaw Argentina's contentious takeover of YPF and ensuing legal battles during her tenure (2007-2015). Milei vowed to appeal the ruling. 

Fernández's abrupt move to seize control of YPF at the time helped bring serial defaulter Argentina further infamy for abandoning its global financial obligations. Milei inherited an economy in shambles after decades of reckless state spending and campaigned on pledges to privatize state companies.

In granting the request of former shareholders largely represented by Burford Capital, which finances litigation in return for a share of the winnings, Judge Loretta Preska of the Southern District of New York gave Argentina two weeks to transfer its shares in YPF to Bank of New York Mellon Corp, the major U.S. custody bank, according to the ruling seen by The Associated Press. 

Because YPF is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the plaintiffs could file the lawsuit in a U.S. district court. Shares of YPF closed down 5.6%. 




The judgement stems from a long-running legal case that in 2023 saw Judge Preska find Argentina liable for $16.1 billion in damages and interest. The plaintiffs argue that the government should have launched a tender offer for stakes held by minority shareholders. 

Milei, whose government has struggled to build up depleted foreign reserves, has vowed to appeal the ruling “to defend national interests” and blamed the problem on his political rivals.

“More than 10 years have passed, and we Argentines continue to suffer the consequences of the worst government in Argentine history,” he wrote on social media platform X.

Marcelo J. García, Director for the Americas at the New York-based Horizon Engage risk consultancy, said the ruling was “a reminder for the Milei administration that the country's problems will not go away just because he blames the opposition for them.”

“Control of YPF is important for Milei; that's why an appeal is the only option for him,” he added.

Paying up and losing the controlling stake in YPF — which has become a pillar of the economy — would cripple Argentina at a crucial moment for Milei's government.

YPF has accelerated its drive to develop the country's huge reserves of shale gas in the Vaca Muerta field in Argentine Patagonia. Crude production at Vaca Muerta has steadily climbed, hitting record production in May at 448,000 barrels per day, 22.5% more than the same month in 2024, according to official data. 

In 2024, YPF notched a net profit of almost $2.4 billion, up from a $1.3 billion loss the year before.

Milei has hoped to leverage investments in the Vaca Muerta field to cure the nation's long-standing fiscal weakness and pay its massive deficits.

Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D. expresses his certainty that the 'big, beautiful bill' will reach President Donald Trump's desk by the deadline and the changes the Senate has made on 'Fox Report.'

Senate Republicans rallied to send President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" back to the House, notching a major victory in their record-shattering march toward getting the legislation signed into law.

Nearly every Republican in the upper chamber coalesced to advance Trump's $3.3 trillion megabill, save for Sens.Thom Tillis, R-N.C., Rand Paul, R-Ky, and Susan Collins, R-Maine. No Senate Democrat crossed the aisle to support the bill.

DEM DELAY TACTIC ENDS, DEBATE BEGINS ON TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

Vice President JD Vance's tie-breaking vote was needed to push the bill across the finish line – unlike on Saturday, when the Ohio Republican descended on Capitol Hill in anticipation of a tight vote to proceed with debate on the bill.

That comes after Republican leadership tried to win over the votes of Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, with sweeteners in the final, amended version of the bill. 

The bill now heads to the House, where fiscal hawks in the House Freedom Caucus are frustrated with what they say are shallow spending cuts, and moderates are concerned over cuts to Medicaid. All have warned that they may not support the bill. 

Still, Republican leaders have made clear that they intend to have the bill on Trump's desk by Friday.

Many House Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called on the Senate to change as little as possible. A product that could pass the House was front of mind for some Senate Republicans as the day dragged on. 

""We're talking to the House,"" Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said. ""We know they're going to have some issues over there, just like we had some issues when it came over here, too. But we think we're going to pass a bill that they can pass.""

House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith, the chief tax writer in the House, said he was ""optimistic"" about the bill on his way to the Senate floor Tuesday morning. 

""We're moving to the point that we're getting more balance, and what I've said all along is let's have balance in the bill,"" the Missouri Republican said. ""We're going to get this done, we're going to get this to the president by July 4."" 

Republicans pushed the chamber from the end of June to the beginning of July after a marathon weekend that saw a high drama unfold on the Senate floor, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., bleed time, hours of mostly one-sided debate, the occasional protest in the Senate gallery, a grueling blast of amendments and the penultimate vote to move the ball forward for the president's ambitious agenda.

The blur from Monday to Tuesday, like the weekend slog before it, was not without its own dramatics.  

Senate Democrats tried numerous times to shelve the legislation during the ""vote-a-rama,"" while Republicans sought to revive certain measures that were scrapped – like provisions that would have booted illegal immigrants from Medicaid – or amendments to sate key Republican holdouts. 

And before the bill was put on the floor for a final vote, last-minute deals were struck and changes made in a ""wraparound"" amendment to attract holdouts. 

Included was the doubling of the rural hospital fund to $50 billion, which was pushed by Collins, and a rollback of the start date of supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) work requirements for states with higher payment error rates, like Alaska. 

Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" is crammed with his and congressional Republicans' legislative priorities, including billions for the Pentagon and to bolster the White House's border and immigration agenda, the permanent extension of his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, deep spending cuts and an effort to reform Medicaid.

Senate Republicans have pitched the bill as a way to both turbocharge the economy and as a means to prevent Trump's first-term tax cuts from expiring. They have simultaneously used it as a vehicle to achieve deep spending cuts in the neighborhood of $1.5 trillion.

But Senate Democrats have railed against the package for the millions it could boot off of Medicaid and the trillions it could add to the federal deficit.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released two sets of scores Saturday and Sunday that reflected both current policy and current law. Under current policy, the bill would tack on just over $507 billion over the next decade. But under current law, the package would add roughly $3.3 trillion.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Reuters)

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., countered that when it came to spending, Senate Democrats were being hypocritical. 

""I've been here a long time,"" Thune said. ""And I've not been involved in a single spending debate and fight in which Republicans were trying to spend less, and Democrats were trying to spend more, with one exception. 

""And that's national security,"" he continued. ""Democrats are always willing to cut defense but never want to cut anywhere else.""

But Schumer accused Trump of ""lying"" about the bill, particularly over the nature of proposed cuts to Medicaid and the economic growth potential tied to the tax package. 

And in one final act of defiance ahead of the bill's final passage, Schumer had the official title of the legislation ""The One Big, Beautiful Bill Act"" nixed. ""The American people will not forget what Republicans do in this chamber today,"" Schumer said.

FIRST ON FOX: Two Chinese nationals face serious charges after they allegedly acted as agents of the People's Republic of China's government to collect intelligence about U.S. Navy service members and bases, while also recruiting other military members to carry out tasks for the country's main foreign intelligence service, the Ministry of State Security (MSS).

The Department of Justice (DOJ) said Chinese national Yuance Chen, who resides in Happy Valley, Oregon, and Liren Lai, who traveled to Houston on a tourist visa in April 2025, were arrested on Friday. Both individuals face charges of overseeing and carrying out various clandestine intelligence tasks in the U.S. on behalf of the Ministry of State Security.

Along with assisting with the recruitment of potential MSS assets and gathering intel about service members and bases, the two men are accused of facilitating a ""dead drop"" payment of cash on behalf of the MSS.

The FBI arrested both men on Friday – Chen was arrested in Happy Valley while Lai was arrested in Houston – with help from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS).

""Today's arrests reflect the FBI's unwavering commitment to protecting our national security and safeguarding the integrity of our military,"" FBI Director Kash Patel told Fox News Digital. ""The individuals charged were acting on behalf of a hostile foreign intelligence service — part of the Chinese Communist Party's broader effort to infiltrate and undermine our institutions. Thanks to outstanding coordination with our partners, including NCIS, we disrupted those efforts and sent a clear message: the United States will not tolerate espionage on American soil. Our counterintelligence operations remain focused, vigilant, and relentless.""

Citing a criminal complaint filed in the Northern District of California, the DOJ said the government of the PRC conducts intelligence activities against the U.S. using various means, including the MSS, which is involved with collecting intelligence on civilians. The MSS is also responsible for foreign intelligence, counterintelligence and political security.

The complaint alleges that Lai recruited Chen to work for the MSS in 2021.

The two men were in Guangzhou, China in January 2022, when they allegedly collaborated to facilitate a dead-drop payment of at least $10,000 on behalf of the MSS. The operation involved working with others in the U.S. to leave a backpack with the cash at a day-use locker in Livermore, California.

Lai and Chen continued working on behalf of the MSS after the cash drop payment and helped with identifying Navy individuals who might be willing to work on behalf of the MSS as well.

The DOJ said in 2022 and 2023, the two visited a U.S. Naval installation in Washington State as well as a Navy recruitment center in San Gabriel, California.

While at the recruitment center, Chen allegedly took photos of a bulletin board that contained the names, programs and hometowns of Navy recruits. The majority of those listed on the board noted that their hometown was ""China,"" and the photos appeared to be transmitted to an MSS intelligence officer in China, the DOJ claimed.

The DOJ also alleged that the MSS gave Chen instructions on what to say to potential recruits when it came to payment that could be made by the MSS, preferred Naval job assignments for potential recruits and methods to minimize Chen's risk of being exposed.

Chen ultimately began to communicate with a member of the Navy on social media, the DOJ alleges, and arranged for a tour of the USS Abraham Lincoln in San Diego with the employee. Chen also sent information about the employee to the MSS, the complaint said.

In April 2024 and March 2025, Chen traveled to Guangzhou where he met with MSS intelligence officers, the complaint alleged, to discuss pay for specific tasks.

Lai also allegedly traveled to Houston in April 2025 and claimed the purpose of the visit was related to his business as an online retailer. He also claimed he would be staying in Houston for two weeks.

But on May 9, 2025, which was more than four weeks after he arrived in the U.S., Lai was seen traveling in a car with a companion from Houston to California, and back to Junction, Texas, on May 15.

Chen and Lai have been charged with operating in the U.S. as an agent of a foreign government without notifying the U.S. attorney general. If convicted, both men face a fine of up to $250,000 and up to 10 years behind bars.

""Hostile foreign intelligence services like the PRC's Ministry of State Security dedicate years to recruiting individuals and cultivating them as intelligence assets to do their bidding within the United States,"" Assistant Attorney General John Eisenberg of the Justice Department's National Security Division said. ""Under my leadership, the National Security Division will continue to defend our nation and way of life by rooting out and exposing our adversaries' clandestine spy networks.""

President Donald Trump discusses his solution to allowing law-abiding, working illegal immigrants to remain in U.S. and pay taxes on 'Sunday Morning Futures.' 

The Justice Department issued a memo directing US attorneys to ""prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings"" as part of an effort by the Trump administration to crack down on crime. 

The memo from Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate states that denaturalization cases against ""individuals who pose a potential danger to national security, including those with a nexus to terrorism, espionage, or the unlawful export from the United States of sensitive goods, technology, or information raising national security concerns"" are one of the key priorities. 

""The benefits of civil denaturalization include the government's ability to revoke the citizenship of individuals who engaged in the commission of war crimes, extrajudicial killings, or other serious human rights abuses; to remove naturalized criminals, gang members, or, indeed, any individuals convicted of crimes who pose an ongoing threat to the United States; and to prevent convicted terrorists from returning to U.S. soil or traveling internationally on a U.S. passport,"" Shumate wrote. 

""The Department of Justice may institute civil proceedings to revoke a person's United States citizenship if an individual either ‘illegally procured' naturalization or procured naturalization by ‘concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation,'"" he added in the June 11 directive, as first reported by Fox News Digital.

Shumate said the Justice Department's Civil Division should ""prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings in all cases permitted by law and supported by the evidence."" 

The memo said attorneys should pursue denaturalization cases against individuals who ""committed human trafficking, sex offenses, or violent crimes"" and those who ""engaged in various forms of financial fraud against the United States (including Paycheck Protection Program (‘PPP') loan fraud and Medicaid/Medicare fraud).""

It also calls for attorneys to initiate cases against ""individuals who further or furthered the unlawful enterprise of criminal gangs, transnational criminal organizations, and drug cartels"" and ""individuals who engaged in fraud against private individuals, funds, or corporations."" 

Overall, the memo lists ten priority categories for denaturalization.

Two days after issuing the memo, the Justice Department said it ""secured the denaturalization of a convicted collector and distributor of child sexual abuse material.""

Oliver Gibson, a former NFL defensive lineman who played for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cincinnati Bengals, has died, his family and Notre Dame announced.

He was 53.

Gibson played nine seasons in the NFL after the Steelers selected the former Fighting Irish star in the fourth round of the 1995 draft. He was in the same draft class as Mark Bruener, Kordell Stewart and Brenden Stai.

""We are deeply saddened by the passing of Oliver Gibson. We send our condolences to his family and friends,"" Notre Dame said in a statement on Monday.

Gibson played in 133 games and recorded 17.5 sacks along with 243 combined tackles. The best season of his career came in 1999, when he put together 4.5 sacks with 41 tackles. He played all 16 games with the Bengals that year.

Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Fahey assesses President Donald Trump's big Supreme Court victories on ‘Fox Report.'

Senior Democratic Party officials vowed Monday to ""fight tooth and nail"" to keep in place federal campaign spending limits up for Supreme Court review this fall — describing the GOP-led effort to repeal the limits as unprecedented and dangerous ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to review the case, National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission, taking up a challenge filed by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee, and on behalf of two Senate Republican candidates, including now-Vice President JD Vance, following the 2022 elections.

In a statement Monday, the Democratic campaign groups vowed to fight back against what they characterized as the GOP's attempt to ""sow chaos and fundamentally upend our campaign finance system, which would return us to the pre-Watergate era of campaign finance.""

SUPREME COURT TO HEAR REPUBLICAN CHALLENGE THAT COULD SHAKE UP US ELECTIONS

At issue are federal spending limits that restrict the amount of money political parties can spend on behalf of certain candidates — and which Republicans argue run afoul of free speech protections under the First Amendment of the Constitution.

A decision from the Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority could have major implications on campaign spending in the U.S., further eroding the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, a law Congress passed more than 50 years ago with the aim of restricting the amount of money that can be spent on behalf of candidates.

That law, and subsequent amendments, restricts the amount of money that political parties can funnel into certain campaigns.

Senior Democratic Party officials described the GOP-led effort Monday as the latest effort by Republicans to claw back campaign spending limits and erode some 50 years of federal election law.

""Republicans know their grassroots support is drying up across the country, and they want to drown out the will of the voters,"" DCCC chair Suzan DelBene, DSCC chair Kirsten Gillibrand, and DNC chair Ken Martin said in a joint statement Monday.

The case is almost certain to be one of the most high-profile cases heard by the Supreme Court this fall.

Adding to the drama is the involvement of the Trump-led Justice Department, which said in May that it planned to side with the NRSC in the case — putting the Trump administration in the somewhat unusual position of arguing against a law passed by Congress.

Justice Department officials cited free speech protections as its basis for siding with the NRSC, which they said represents ""the rare case that warrants an exception to that general approach"" of backing federal laws."" 

Meanwhile, the Democratic groups sought to go on offense with their message, describing the GOP efforts as the latest iteration of a decades-long effort to ""rewrite"" election laws in ways that benefit the party. They cited another Republican-led challenge to campaign spending limits brought more than 20 years ago, in Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC. 

That challenge was ultimately rejected by the high court, DNC officials noted.

""To date, those efforts have failed at every turn, ensuring a stable, predictable campaign finance structure for party committees and political candidates across the country,"" DNC officials said.

Meanwhile, Republican officials praised the Supreme Court's decision to take up the case, which they described as helping the GOP ensure they are in ""the strongest possible position"" ahead of the 2026 midterms and beyond.""

""The government should not restrict a party committee's support for its own candidates,"" Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C. who chair the NRSC and NRCC, respectively, said Monday.

""These coordinated expenditure limits violate the First Amendment, and we appreciate the court's decision to hear our case,"" they added.

National Review editor-in-chief Rich Lowry and FOX Business' Liz Claman join 'MediaBuzz' to discuss Hegseth's heated press conference where he called out the media's 'hatred' of President Donald Trump. 

Donald Trump must be feeling pretty powerful.

He's even demanding that Israel cancel the criminal trial of Bibi Netanyahu.

By any objective analysis, whether you like the president or not, he has been on an incredible winning streak for the last two weeks. Everything seems to be breaking his way.

And as he racks up these victories, from the powder keg of the Middle East to the staunchly conservative Supreme Court, he seems to grow bigger and stronger, like some comic book superhero, and then zap his next adversary.

TRUMP SLAMS BIBI OVER CEASEFIRE VIOLATIONS, DENOUNCES CABLE CHANNELS OVER SKEPTICISM

By hitting Iran's nuclear sites with 30,000-pound bombs – even as we debate the impact – Trump took a risk that stunned the world.

With media liberals and Democrats still in full resistance mode, the coverage has been largely negative, but that doesn't matter. Since his days as a New York developer, he has been boosted by critical coverage because that drives the news agenda and gets everyone chattering about his preferred topic. 

But telling another country to drop criminal charges against its leader is a whole new level of what his native city calls chutzpah.

One must admit – President Trump has had a good two weeks. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)

Trump posted the following: ""It is terrible what they are doing in Israel to Bibi Netanyahu. He is a War Hero, and a Prime Minister who did a fabulous job working with the United States to bring Great Success in getting rid of the dangerous Nuclear threat in Iran.""

Netanyahu is in ""the process of negotiating a Deal with Hamas, which will include getting the Hostages back,"" and Trump wonders how the Israelis could force him ""to sit in a Courtroom all day long, over NOTHING.""

TRUMP PRESSURES ISRAEL TO END GAZA CONFLICT AS HE EYES ABRAHAM ACCORDS EXPANSION

As Axios points out, Netanyahu is charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust:  

""He's accused of accepting more than $200,000 in gifts from wealthy businessmen, and of granting regulatory benefits worth hundreds of millions of dollars to a telecom tycoon in exchange for favorable news coverage.""

The trial has dragged on for four years, thanks to Netanyahu's delaying tactics, and there was this war thing that intervened. 

So now Trump has called for the trial to be canceled or Netanyahu granted a pardon – and done it quite openly. 

Imagine if a foreign head of state urged this country to drop charges against a major political figure. But, Trump doesn't play by everyone else's rules.

What's more, the stock market just hit record highs.

Another Trumpian tactic is to make a big move immediately after a major uproar, when the public and press barely has time to digest the previous controversy. 

So the president cut off trade talks with Canada to protest its taxation of major American tech companies such as Amazon and Google. This involves revenue they earn from online marketplaces, data and social media involving Canadian users.

Before the weekend was out, Canada caved and rescinded the taxes. It's another case of Trump's tough-guy negotiating tactics getting instant results.

The not-so-beautiful budget bill in the Senate is another classic case. Elon Musk – did you really think he'd stay quiet for long? – calls it ""utterly insane"" and ""political suicide for the Republican Party."" The CBO says it would add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over a decade. The Senate measure would also make deep cuts in Medicaid, which Trump has vowed to protect. 

Here's the point: One of the loudest Republican critics is Sen. Thom Tillis, who has been voting against a bill he says would betray the president's promise to protect those on Medicaid. Trump has trashed him, saying he will recruit a challenger to oust him from the Senate in next year's primary. 

The next day, literally, Tillis announced that he would not run for reelection. 

So Trump can save his money. He knocked out the North Carolina lawmaker with a couple of postings.

And then there's the Supreme Court.

By ruling that local judges cannot issue nationwide injunctions, the court has immensely increased the power of Trump and the executive branch. The 6-3 decision came in the birthright citizenship case, though not on the merits, and tore down one of the last guardrails against unchecked presidential power.

It applies to Democratic presidents too, though far more of these injunctions – 40 – have been brought against Trump just in the opening months of his second term. Joe Biden faced 14 in the first three years of his term.

These injunctions – which have always seemed unfair to me, on both sides – also extend Trump's winning streak in the high court. He has, after all, appointed three of the six justices that make up the conservative majority.

JOHN YOO: TRUMP SCORES HISTORIC WIN AS SUPREME COURT REINS IN LOWER COURTS' OVERREACH

And that's not all. SCOTUS ruled that parents with religious objections can pull their children out of public school classrooms when books with LGBTQ themes are being taught.

In yet another decision, the court upheld a Tennessee law banning some forms of transition surgery for transgender youths. Trump has ordered transgender members of the military to leave the service.

Sonia Sotomayor read two blistering dissents from the bench, especially in the birthright citizenship case: ""Today's decision is not just egregiously wrong, it is also a travesty of law…No right is safe."" 

Trump has made clear that he will use expanded powers to be even more aggressive than in the past. Throw in his pressure tactics and funding freezes against elite law firms and Ivy League universities and you have an emboldened president even more determined to stick it to his opponents and detractors.

Of course, even Trump has his limits. The effort to derail Netanyahu's corruption trial was destined to fail. 

Oh wait.

An Israeli court yesterday canceled this week's hearings on diplomatic and national security grounds, based on classified information provided by the prime minister and the Mossad spy agency.

The Senate is on track to make history with its “vote-a-rama” session that started Monday morning and continued into Tuesday. During the marathon voting session, lawmakers proposed dozens of amendments to President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The previous record for the most roll-call votes during a vote-a-rama was 44 from 2008, but Democrats, with the help of some Republicans, appear to have broken the record on Tuesday. Around 7:30 a.m. Tuesday, senators took their 45th roll-call vote, when counting a pair of procedural votes that started the session on Monday.

GOP BRACES FOR DEMOCRATIC ‘VOTE-A-RAMA' BLITZ AS SENATE NEARS FINAL VOTE ON ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said Democrats would bring “amendment after amendment after amendment to the floor,” so Republicans “can try to explain their massive cuts to Medicaid, to people back home.” 

Here is a rolling list of all the amendments that come up on Monday and Tuesday and whether they have passed or failed:

Essentially a technical question on whether the “one big, beautiful bill” follows budgetary rules. It was presented by Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), and its resulting vote was 53-47, indicating the decision of the chair stands. This vote affirms the GOP decision that Trump's tax extension should not count against the current policy baseline and should not add more spending.

It was presented by Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and its resulting vote of 53-47 indicates that the budget accounting assumptions used in the changes to the House-passed reconciliation bill are correct; no budget rules have been violated.

It was presented by Schumer, who pushed back against rising costs for healthcare to fund billionaire tax cuts and proposed sending the bill back to the Finance Committee, ultimately delaying its passage. The resulting vote was 47-53, indicating the motion was denied.

It was presented by Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), who pushed back against cuts to Medicare and Medicaid and was concerned about hospital closures. Markey followed Schumer's lead and proposed sending the bill back to the Finance Committee to delay its passage. The resulting vote was 49-51, and the motion was denied.

It was presented by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who advised against cuts to the SNAP program and raised concerns on budget rules. The resulting vote was 51-48 to waive Klobuchar's point of order, and the motion passed.

It was presented by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), who voiced his support for sending the bill back to the Finance Committee to strike its Medicare and Medicaid cuts. The resulting vote was 47-53, and the motion was denied.

It was presented by Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), who stressed the bill would result in massive cuts to Medicaid and other programs, tying people up in “red tape” that would result in them losing their healthcare. The resulting vote was 48-52, and the motion was denied.

It was presented by Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), who urged lawmakers to send the bill back to the Finance Committee because of its “harmful” proposed cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. The resulting vote was 49-51, and the motion was denied.

It was presented by Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI), who claimed nursing homes would be at risk of closing or would have to reduce space if this bill passed, arguing it should be sent back to the Finance Committee for revisions. The resulting vote was 48-52, and the motion was denied.

It was presented by Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA), who asked lawmakers not to let Affordable Healthcare Act provisions expire with the passage of this bill. The individual tax rate would be increased for those making over $10,000,000 per year. The motion needed at least 60 affirmative votes to pass, but the final vote came to 47-53, and the motion was denied.

It was presented by Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), whose motion rejected cuts to Medicaid because it funds vital hospital services, especially those for maternal care and infants. Medicaid covers 40% of total births nationwide and roughly 50% of births in rural communities. The resulting vote was 48-52, and the motion was denied.

Presented by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), the motion would strike the reduction in the funding cap for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The resulting vote was 47-53, and the motion was denied.

Presented by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), the motion was intended to decrease federal Medicaid expansion to states that provide state-funded coverage for undocumented immigrants who have been charged with or convicted of certain crimes. It needed at least 60 affirmative votes to pass. The resulting vote was 56-44, and the motion was denied.

Presented by Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), the motion was intended to prevent cryptocurrency corruption. It needed at least 60 affirmative votes to pass, but the resulting vote was 47-53, and the motion was denied.

Presented by Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), the motion was intended to overturn the provision to defund Planned Parenthood. It needed at least 60 affirmative votes to pass, but the resulting vote was 49-51, and the motion was denied.

Offered by Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), the amendment was intended to close a loophole that allows illegal immigrants to receive Medicaid coverage for up to 90 days until their citizenship is verified. It needed at least 60 votes to pass, but the resulting vote was 53-47 and failed.

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) offered this motion to prohibit any federal agency from terminating more than 1% of its employees, if any of the terminated employees is a veteran. The motion failed by a 47-53 vote.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) wanted to prohibit the Department of Defense from using any funds appropriated by Congress to accept, retrofit, or transfer a plane given by a foreign government, such as Qatar, for use as Air Force One under President Donald Trump. The effort failed by a 47-53 vote.

Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) sought to send the bill back to committee with instructions to strike any provisions that may cut Medicaid payments for substance use disorder treatment. The motion failed in a 47-53 vote. 

Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH) offered a motion to send the bill back to the Finance Committee with the stated goal of ending the trade war with Canada and protecting Americans from cost increases. The motion failed 48-52.

Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD) sought to send the bill back to committee with instructions to strike any provision that reduces taxes on people making more than $10 million. Senators took a voice vote, and the “no's” prevailed.

Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) filed a motion to have the bill go back to committee and strike provisions that reduce the average tax liability of people making more than $100 million. The motion failed by a voice vote.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) brought a motion to instruct the Finance Committee to take out portions of the bill that would reduce taxes on those making more than $500 million. The senators voted by voice, and the “no's” overpowered. The motion failed.

Sen. Angus King (I-ME) offered the motion to direct the committee to strike any provision that reduces tax liabilities for those with an income above $1 billion. It failed by voice vote. 

Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) sought to send the bill back to committee to ensure it did not increase the deficit. The motion was not agreed to in a 47-53 vote. 

Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) offered a motion to revise the bill in committee to increase the amount and availability of the child tax credit. The motion failed in a 47-53 vote. 

Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) brought an amendment to increase to 39.6% the income tax rate for people making more than $25 million and provide additional funding to the Rural Health Transformation Program, doubling the rural hospital fund to $50 million. The amendment failed 22-78.

Sen. Andy Kim (D-NJ) sought to strike a provision relating to limiting Medicaid payments to home care workers. The motion failed 48-52.

Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) introduced an amendment to bar unemployment benefits from being distributed ot “jobless” millionaires. The motion passed through a voice vote.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) brought an amendment to reduce the cost of prescription drugs in Medicare and expand dental, vision, and hearing coverage. The vote, which needed 60 votes to pass, failed 47-53.

Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) moved to strip her provision over artificial intelligence regulation after a deal over the amendment fell through. The motion to strip language aimed at stopping states from developing AI regulations passed overwhelmingly, 99-1. Sen. Thom Thillis (R-NC) was the lone “no” vote.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Elon Musk goes off again","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/daily-memo/3459184/elon-musk-goes-off-again-big-beautiful-bill/","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 12:25:43 GMT","

ELON MUSK GOES OFF AGAIN. Has it really been less than a month since Elon Musk flew off the handle, trashed his benefactor, the president, pledged to kill the administration's top legislative priority, and, on top of all that, called to have the president impeached? It seems like years ago, but it has actually been less than 30 days. That's how quickly Musk disappeared from national politics when he left his position at the Department of Government Efficiency and returned to his valuable work at SpaceX and Tesla, among other companies.

Now, though, Musk is at it again. With President Donald Trump's top legislative priority — Trump calls it the “big, beautiful bill” — in a critical stage on Capitol Hill, Musk has stepped in again to threaten the president and the Republican Party with political ruination. What a good friend!

Musk's relapse is important because of 1) who he is, 2) how much money he has, and 3) the importance of passing the bill to Trump's influence and legacy. Legislatively speaking, the “big, beautiful bill” is the embodiment of everything Trump has done as president. It would make permanent the premier legislative achievement of his first term, the Trump tax cuts. It would fulfill the top unfulfilled promise of the first term, the border wall. It would make good on promises made during the 2024 campaign, such as no tax on tips and greater border security. It is one long expression of Trump's priorities as president. For the last five months, Trump has achieved many things by using his executive authority. Now, the “big, beautiful bill” is teed up to be Trump's big achievement in legislation.

And his close friend Elon is trying to kill it. Starting on Monday afternoon, Musk, who overpromised and underdelivered on his self-perceived abilities to cut government spending, began a series of posts in which he urged, and then threatened, House Republicans who planned to vote for the bill.

At 3:08 p.m., Musk posted, “It is obvious with the insane spending of this bill, which increases the debt ceiling by a record FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS that we live in a one-party country — the PORKY PIG PARTY!! Time for a new political party that actually cares about the people.”

At 3:36, he posted, targeting House conservatives, “How can you call yourself the Freedom Caucus if you vote for a DEBT SLAVERY bill with the biggest debt ceiling increase in history?” He included the names of Reps. Andy Harris (R-MD) and Chip Roy (R-TX).

At 4:02, he posted, “Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame! And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.”

At 6:02, he posted, “If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day. Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a VOICE.”

At 9:41, he posted an illustration of a puppet on fire with the heading LIAR. Musk wrote, “Anyone who campaigned on the PROMISE of REDUCING SPENDING, but continues to vote on the BIGGEST DEBT ceiling increase in HISTORY will see their face on this poster in the primary next year.”

The tweeting continued as Monday turned into Tuesday. At 12:52 a.m., Musk posted, “Hitting the debt ceiling is the only thing that will actually force the government to cut waste and fraud. That's why the debt ceiling legislation exists!”

A few minutes later, a follower posted, “Just rein in spending and the Republicans could keep Elon on board.” At 1:04 a.m., Musk answered, “All I'm asking is that we don't bankrupt America.”

At 1:06, he posted, “What's the point of a debt ceiling if we keep raising it?”

At 1:32, he posted his support of Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), who has opposed Trump at virtually every turn. Musk also posted the results of a self-generated X poll in which he said 80% of participants favored his threatened new political party. “VOX POPULI, VOX DEI,” Musk posted.

Obviously, Trump would have to respond. So at 12:44 a.m., in the midst of Musk's rant, Trump posted on Truth Social: “Elon Musk knew, long before he so strongly endorsed me for president, that I was strongly against the EV mandate. It is ridiculous, and was always a major part of my campaign. Electric cars are fine, but not everyone should be forced to own one. Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more rocket launches, satellites, or electric car production, and our country would save a FORTUNE. Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!”

Trump's point — recipient of massive government subsidies decries massive federal spending — was entirely clear. Yes, Musk's space company does great things and performs services that the government needs. But the same cannot be said for the electric vehicle mandate, and if that is what Musk is upset about, then he has simply run afoul of Republican orthodoxy on Capitol Hill. Of course, Musk also angered Democrats during his brief stint in Washington, so it is unclear where he will go for help on that.

But the big picture is this: At a critical moment in Donald Trump's presidency, and in the workings of the Republican Congress, Elon Musk stepped in, again, to try to kill the GOP's top priority. He appears to believe that he has too much money to ignore, and that is probably true. But that doesn't mean he will be taken seriously when he does the same thing in the future.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

EVERGLADES, Florida — President Donald Trump on Tuesday will tour Alligator Alcatraz, a newly completed, federally run immigrant detention facility in the heart of Florida swampland, following hours of constant construction in the lead-up to his arrival.

Dozens of dump trucks were seen on Monday going in and out of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in Ochopee, roughly 50 miles west of coastal Miami. Trucks and construction crews rushed to complete the tentlike structures and infrastructure for the new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention site with less than 24 hours before the commander in chief's arrival.

MASS EXODUS OF 9/11 HIRES THREATENS TRUMP'S BORDER SECURITY MISSION

A Secret Service agent stood by the site's entrance, approving or denying vehicles that attempted to pass through the gated entrance off of Tamiami Trail, a one-lane road that links Miami to the Gulf Coast city of Naples.

The agent was supported by several Florida National Guard members who stood nearby a Humvee.

The normally remote town of fewer than 150 residents was buzzing Monday as vehicles drove on the narrow road along the alligator-infested inlets. Several reporters were on site, with more press and protesters expected Tuesday as Trump shows up to inspect the rush job of building an emergency ICE jail.

Several dozen activists and protesters who oppose the expansion of the regional airport gathered along the road over the weekend with signs calling for the project to end and warning it would damage the environment.

The Washington Examiner reported Sunday evening that Trump would make an appearance at the facility, which was confirmed Monday by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

“President Trump will travel to the great state of Florida to attend the opening of a new illegal alien detention center located at Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, alongside [Homeland Security] Secretary Kristi Noem, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), congressman Byron Donalds, and other state and local leaders,” Leavitt said Monday afternoon during a briefing at the White House. 

Leavitt touted the site's remoteness as a security feature that would deter detained immigrants from attempting to escape from federal custody.

“There's only one road leading in, and there is the only way out,” Leavitt said. “It is isolated and surrounded by dangerous wildlife in unforgiving terrain. The facility will have up to 5,000 beds to house, process, and deport criminal illegal aliens. This is an efficient and low-cost way to help carry out the largest mass deportation campaign in American history.”

Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, a Republican, proposed the project earlier in June and touted that the tent facility would not require much of a barrier surrounding the site because if immigrants were to escape, “there's not much waiting for them, other than alligators and pythons.”

DeSantis took executive action in late June, greenlighting an expeditious effort to stand up the soft-sided facilities at the mostly unused airport strip. During remarks Monday celebrating the state's fiscal 2025-2026 budget, DeSantis said the multipurpose airport and detention center created an “effective way” to increase ICE deportations.

“The federal government can fly right on the runway right there,” DeSantis told reporters at a press conference in Wildwood. “You literally drive them 2,000 feet, put them on a plane, and then they're gone. It's very logistically simple.”

As a candidate, Trump promised to carry out the largest-ever deportation operation, but his administration has struggled to achieve such a feat without enough ICE officers or detention space nationwide.

Although DeSantis was an opponent of Trump in the 2024 GOP presidential primary, he has been a supporter of the deportation operation. Earlier this year, DeSantis allowed state and county law enforcement to work directly with ICE to arrest illegal immigrants at a faster rate.

DeSantis has increased his state's cooperation with this latest move on expediting a detention space in his state.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, previewed Trump's visit with a press release issued Monday that highlighted how some of the “worst of the worst criminal aliens” have already been arrested in Florida as part of the Trump administration's plan to go after and deport criminal illegal immigrants.

“Alligator Alcatraz, and other facilities like it, will give us the capability to lock up some of the worst scumbags who entered our country under the previous administration,” Noem said in a statement. “We will expand facilities and bed space in just days thanks to our partnership with Florida. Make America safe again.”

ICE, not state authorities, will run the site.

The property is nearly identical to structures that the Border Patrol erected amid the record-high influx of illegal immigrants who came over the southern border during the Biden administration. The tents are massive in size and include large rooms for families, adult men, and adult women to be housed. 

The facility also includes laundry machines, bathrooms and showers, and a dining area.

The DHS listed illegal immigrants arrested by ICE in Florida who had been convicted of homicide, kidnapping, sexual assault of a minor, aggravated assault of a police officer, arson, and support of a foreign terrorist organization. DeSantis estimated on Monday that the state had 50,000 illegal immigrant residents who had been previously ordered by a federal immigration judge to be deported but had not left the country.

DeSantis revealed that the state is also looking at setting up another ICE detention center at Camp Blanding, a Florida National Guard site in northeast Florida.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

In partnership with more than a dozen left-wing activist groups, the “sanctuary city” of Providence, Rhode Island, is sending illegal immigrants instructions by mail on how to navigate Immigration and Customs Enforcement encounters and effectively evade capture.

According to a press release announcing the citywide direct-mail campaign, the all-Democrat Providence City Council created the postcard advisories in response to “the brutal and unconstitutional enforcement tactics currently being undertaken by the far-right federal administration.”

“By taking this unprecedented action to protect our immigrant communities, councilors are sending a clear message: every Providence resident has a right to lead a dignified life free from state-sponsored intimidation and terrorization,” the announcement said.

Once processed, the informational “Know Your Rights” flyers will be directly distributed via postal service to every household in Providence. Printing and postage reportedly cost $17,000 for the over 62,500 residences expected to receive the postcards.

The 6×11 cards consist of two sections. In the top portion, illegal immigrants are advised of actions to take if an ICE agent appears at their home. “DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR,” the instructions say. “DO NOT ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR SIGN ANYTHING.”

‼️📢KNOW YOUR RIGHTS📢‼️Today, in direct response to the brutal and unconstitutional enforcement tactics currently being undertaken by the far-right federal administration, Providence City Council President Rachel Miller announced that a “Know Your Rights” mail piece will be… pic.twitter.com/zcUsuaRbEx

The lower pocket-sized segment, which declares “I will not open the door for an ICE administrative warrant,” can be cut off, stored in a wallet, and presented to immigration officers. “If you are inside your home, slide it under the door or press it against a window,” the notice tells illegal immigrants.

Activist groups have distributed versions of the red card widely to illegal immigrants across the country since Trump's return to office. 

Residents are also told to report Providence Police Department (PPD) officers if they witness officers assisting federal immigration authorities without a court order. “It is against Providence Police policy to cooperate with ICE without a judicial warrant,” the guide says. If you see an officer violating this, REPORT THEIR NAME AND BADGE NUMBER to the city.”

Signed in 2017, the Community-Police Relations Act prohibits Providence police officers from aiding federal agencies in enforcing U.S. Civil Immigration Law. In late May, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley (D-RI) reaffirmed the city's non-cooperation policy after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security designated it as a “sanctuary” jurisdiction that is deliberately obstructing federal deportation operations. “Providence will not proactively collaborate with ICE to provide information,” said Smiley.

DHS PUBLISHES LIST OF SANCTUARY JURISDICTIONS OBSTRUCTING IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

The mailers at issue additionally list free-of-charge legal assistance resources, such as a 24/7 helpline operated by Dorcas International, which is sponsored in part by council-allocated funds, and the bilingual Deportation Defense Line of Rhode Island run by the Alliance to Mobilize Our Resistance, which alerts “trained responders” to suspected ICE presence in the region.

Dorcas International is Rhode Island's largest, low-cost immigration legal services provider offering deportation defense. Its team of immigration law attorneys represents illegal immigrants facing removal proceedings in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. A recipient of government grant money from Providence since 2022, Dorcas International appears on the city's social services list under “Social Mobility” and “Race Relations.”

AMOR, a defund-the-police nonprofit organization lobbying for legislative bans on such intragovernmental agreements, works to dismantle ICE contracts with detention centers. According to AMOR's 2024 mid-year report, roughly 95% of its casework aids illegal immigrants who seek monetary help and administrative support. AMOR receives funding from several Democratic-aligned organizations, including the Tides Foundation, a major grantmaking entity on the activist Left.

HOW THE LEFT FUNDS THE LEGAL INDUSTRY SHIELDING MIGRANTS FROM DEPORTATION

Dorcas International and AMOR were both part of a pilot equity-based guaranteed income program that provided monthly “no-strings-attached” cash transfers to a targeted portion of Providence's population, regardless of immigration status, with special preference allotted toward “people of color.” Among other organizations, Dorcas and AMOR offered application assistance for those seeking to receive these recurring payments totaling $990,000 over a year-and-a-half period.

In a statement, City Council President Rachel Miller said they worked collaboratively on the mailers with the listed local immigration advocacy organizations “in the face of fear and uncertainty that pervades our city's immigrant communities due to the reckless cruelty of the Trump administration.”

DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said such rhetoric vilifying federal immigration officers is inciting violence against ICE agents.

“Council President Miller's comments calling immigration enforcement ‘state-sponsored intimidation and terrorization' are despicable,” McLaughlin told the Washington Examiner. “This kind of garbage has led to a more than 500% increase in assaults against our ICE law enforcement officers. Providence City Council is putting violent criminal aliens above the safety of their own constituents—it is shameful and embarrassing. President Trump and Secretary Noem are restoring the rule of law and putting the safety of Americans first.”

Meanwhile, the Republican Party of Rhode Island is accusing the city council of trying to raise taxes by 8% in order to cover the initiative's costs. A bill, signed into law last week by Democratic Gov. Dan McKee, allows Providence to exceed the 4% tax levy cap for fiscal 2026 by up to double the state-mandated maximum.

“The optics are blinding: tax the people more, then use their hard-earned money to hand out lawbreaking instructions,” the Rhode Island GOP, which is calling for an investigation into the mass mailing effort, said in a press release. “Providence residents should be outraged and demand that every Council member involved refund the cost of these mailers—personally.”

The Providence City Council did not respond to an inquiry into whether the initiative was solely taxpayer-funded or financed through the various organizations cited as community partners.

On social media, the city council's chief of staff, June Rose, promoted the campaign “[b]rought to you by…the movement.”

Rose, a prominent street-level activist organizer, has been racking up protest-related arrests over the past year. In March, Rose was arrested outside Trump Tower at a demonstration denouncing ICE's detention of pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil. In July 2024, Rose was arrested in the U.S. Capitol building alongside anti-Israel activists protesting against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address before Congress.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

It's a bit of a trope in this year of our Lord 2025 to say that we, whoever we are, are living in unprecedented times. Cultural, political, and social change ran amok between 2010 and 2025. The rise of Black Lives Matter, the transgender movement, Trumpism, COVID-19, and more have made the world very different from that of millennials, Generation X, or baby boomers.

The problem with the claim that we are living in “unprecedented” times is that each of those respective generations I just mentioned defined their own precedents. It's better just to say things are different. I know different doesn't sound quite as spicy, or as urgent, as unprecedented does, but it does have the virtue of being truer. And it has the truth of being a real part of a real history of a real people, rather than fever dreams of utopians always pining for a better world that is just beyond the horizon, if the old order could only be finally gotten rid of.

Every single generation is convinced, it seems, that their revolution will work, and their moment is uniquely in need of revolution. This was the belief that drove the Southern states to secede from the Union in 1860 and 1861. In the summer of 1860, my great-great-grandfather, Robert Morisey, was born in eastern North Carolina on a sizable plantation. Infant Rob lived among people who believed that Abraham Lincoln and the Republican Party represented an unprecedented threat to the slaveholding order. When Abraham Lincoln called up soldiers to prosecute the Civil War, baby Rob's part of North Carolina answered the call enthusiastically.

For four years, he and his family lived on a war footing. And in the third week of March, something happened to Rob and his family that has no precedent for any American living in the United States since the 19th century: An actual army, bent on actual political conquest and the subjugation of Rob's family, invaded. Some 60,000 Union soldiers came from the South, an army of blue-clad soldiers whose chief had a perhaps unearned but terrifying reputation. General William Tecumseh Sherman rolled through Sampson County and nearly obliterated the Confederate Army sent to stop him.

Baby Rob's neighbors were there fighting. And they all were defeated. This wasn't a defeat of a small colonial force or an American army doing a peacekeeping mission, or even nation-building. This was the type of defeat that the civilian population could feel and smell. In what turned out to be the last large-scale battle of the American Civil War, 4,200 men were injured or killed. One month later, Rob's family was a conquered people.

The conquerors were not going to let the slaveholding aristocrats of the South ever rebel again, and to ensure the region was largely pacified, 10 of the 11 Confederate states were put under martial law and de facto military dictatorships. North Carolina and South Carolina were transformed overnight into the Second Military District, governed by one of the most morally loathsome Union generals, Daniel Sickles, most famous for murdering Francis Scott Key's son in broad daylight and then being the first person to use the temporary insanity defense successfully. Ulysses S. Grant loathed Sickles, so the only way he retained any political patronage was by courting the most extreme Radical Republicans who wanted to revolutionize Southern society through congressional-led Reconstruction.

It was to that military district, not a state in the union, but a military government, that Kate Patterson was born in June 1867. She was not legally considered a U.S. citizen. A quarter-century went by. The U.S. reunited politically, and it was the Gilded Age era of American imperial and industrial strength. Sometime in the early 1890s, grown-up Rob met Kate Patterson, and in 1894, they married. They had children and lived as most people of that era did.

But like most Americans in that era, they lived in a world before the medical miracles we take for granted were readily accessible, even if they existed. Kate got sick and died, most likely from the viral or bacterial infections that stalked the South in the late 19th and early 20th Century. In 1878, for example, a yellow fever epidemic decimated New Orleans and Memphis. Five thousand people died in New Orleans, and 25,000 of the Memphis population of 45,000 people left the city. Death was still a constant, right up until the turn of the century.

Rob remarried after Kate's death. His sons were just old enough to be drafted into what was the largest military conflict mankind had ever known: World War I. President Woodrow Wilson's use of government to get America into the war and then sustain the war effort defies imagination. The Committee on Public Information and the 1917 Espionage Act created a network of thousands of de facto domestic spies. The War Industries Board assumed near-total control of the U.S. economy. The late Arthur A. Ekirch, a conservative intellectual and professor at Columbia University, argued that World War I saw near total unanimity in American society in support of the suppression of basic civil and religious liberties. And to top it all off, 117,000 Americans died in the 14 months of combat, which many Americans saw as completely unnecessary.

By contrast, the U.S. deaths in eight years of war in Iraq were 4,400, and 20 years of war in Afghanistan brought about 2,400 deaths. If the war deaths of what was then called the Great War were not enough, another enemy began quietly stalking the globe in 1917. A deadly strain of influenza hit Allied Armies, and the summer of 1918 arrived on the U.S.'s Atlantic Seaboard. By the fall, the Spanish Flu, as it came to be known, made its way to North Carolina. Rob Morisey, a hale 58-year-old father with a friendly smile and a full handlebar mustache, got sick. His 20-year-old daughter, Mattie, tended him and experienced the awful sight of watching her father die the excruciating death that comes from influenza.

Perhaps it's the fact that I knew Mattie that makes this story all so real to me. She was a formal but friendly woman, nearly 90 years old by the time I knew her as my Nana. She died in 1993. I look at my own life — that of what comedian Iliza Shlesinger riffs on as the life of elder millennials — compared to Nana's, and I see relative peace, prosperity, and communal health.

The decline in U.S. religiosity is over. The transgender moment, it seems, is over. The inflation rates of the Biden years, which got to 7%, never approached the nearly 15% the U.S. saw in 1980. Bowling Green State University noted that marriage rates, declining for 50 years, began to increase after 2022. Why then do baby boomers, Gen X, millennials, and Zoomers see each other as so different, and why do Zoomers think they're living through unprecedented times?

King's College London professor Bobby Duffy notes that young people aren't unusual: “What's really changed is the more fractious political and media context: The internet and social media have given us the tools to communicate our differences at scale.”

SOCIAL MEDIA IS CRIPPLING GEN Z

Which makes me wonder what Rob, Kate, and Mattie might have done had they had access to Facebook, Instagram, or X. I imagine that each of them might have felt they experienced something unprecedented. As for me, and for American Zoomers, we live in an era that is undeniably different from the ones that came before.

We've never been invaded by an actual army, and have never been drafted into an unpopular war. We've generally had access to healthcare. We've generally not experienced healthy adults die en masse from uncontrollable disease. For all these reasons, we might give the generations that preceded us a measure of respect. Our problems are different. But hardly “unprecedented.”

This Canada Day, Trump is fueling a very different kind of nationalism.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Canada Day is usually no big deal. The country takes off July 1 for the same reason that Americans take off July 4. There are fireworks, and maybe a parade, but you certainly don't have to show up for either. The established ritual for commemorating Canada's founding is to drive to the quietest place you can near a body of water and drink beer while staring at it.

This year, though, Canada Day is not quiet. It is not peaceful. This year, Canada is trying to make sure there's a Canada Day next year.

By now, the shock of American betrayal has worn off. Donald Trump's threats of annexation by means of economic debilitation are no longer surprising. Unlike many Americans, Canadians have no option but to take these threats seriously. That's why two months ago, in the most extraordinary election of my lifetime, Canadians chose Mark Carney to lead them away from America.

“The system of open global trade anchored by the United States, a system that Canada has relied on since the Second World War—a system that, while not perfect, has helped deliver prosperity to our country for decades—is over,” Carney said in his victory speech. He has not backed down since his election. “A new imperialism threatens,” he said recently. “Middle powers must compete for interests and attention, knowing that if they're not at the table, they're on the menu.” Canada is still figuring out how to stay off the menu.

Trump has caused an extraordinary surge in Canadian nationalism. This nationalism is also new in kind. In the 1960s, Canada's nationalists feared America's power—its military strength, yes, but also its cultural cohesion—and wanted to form a corresponding Canadian identity. They started a movement that posed foundational political questions and ultimately resulted in the “patriation” of the country's constitution (transferring legislative authority from Britain's Parliament to Canada's) and the signing of a charter of rights and freedoms in 1982. Today's Canadian nationalism, by contrast, arises from darker and more practical concerns. The United States is declining into authoritarianism and threatening Canada's sovereignty. How can Canada ensure that its political, military, and economic institutions survive?

Philippe Lagassé: Canada's military has a Trump problem

The problem with Canadian nationalism is that Canada is very new. Before 1982, Canada Day was called “Dominion Day” and celebrated the country's status upgrade to a dominion, rather than a possession, of the British empire. Canada was a product of international and colonial systems before it possessed its own independence. Until it confederated in 1867, it was a series of colonies. After confederation, Canada strove to be the most British dominion in the British empire. Both parties, Liberal and Conservative, have sought to integrate Canada with international trade and security systems. Canada has always lived by the global rules-based order, whichever global rules-based order happened to be around.

Because Canada has relied so much on other countries' systems, it didn't fully develop its own. Our military was constructed to complement America's, not to protect Canada. (Peacekeeping is the kind of military engagement we're most comfortable with. In fact, we practically invented it.) Thanks to the oceans on either side of us, the frozen wasteland to the north, and a gentle behemoth to the south, no one thought much about having to defend our borders. Now the north is melting. So is the south.

As the rules-based order ebbs, Canada has discovered the extent of its own vulnerability. Canadians need answers to questions they've never had to ask, and fast. How do you fight a trade war with an economy that's more than 10 times the size of your own? What kind of military would Canada need to survive, or even to resist, an American annexation? Should the country become a nuclear power? Recently, I've been asking some of those questions as part of an audio series called Gloves Off and have been shocked by just how unprepared Canadians are to address them. Our country's security services are small and domestically focused. Our economic infrastructure is largely designed to get natural resources to American manufacturers. This is the result of naivete: Who would want to hurt little old us? Nobody needs to imagine anymore.

Now Canada is increasing its defense spending and re-arming with Europe, not America. Trump didn't give us much choice. In March, he announced the next generation of American fighter jets, which Canada has long purchased, by noting that he would sell an inferior version to other countries: “We like to tone them down about 10 percent, which probably makes sense because someday maybe they're not our allies, right?” The idea that the American military would turn against Canada once seemed absurd. But the absurd has become almost predictable at this point. If the U.S. Marines are coming for American citizens, surely they could come for Canada too.

Fewer Canadians are traveling to the United States than in the past. Official data from April show that the number of Canadians driving across the border had dropped 35 percent from the previous year. Air travel fell 20 percent. Some are boycotting their southern neighbor, but for others, avoiding it is just a matter of common sense. Why put yourself in the position of being a foreigner in Trump's America? The Canadian government issued a travel advisory in March, but many Canadians already understood the risk. Similarly, even before our government pulled U.S. products from liquor stores, many Canadians had stopped buying American. Some even turned U.S. brands upside down on supermarket shelves so that others would know not to purchase them.

David Frum: Make smuggling great again

The U.S. ambassador to Canada, Pete Hoekstra, has called the product bans “outrageous” and an “insult” to America. “We have not done anything like that,” Hoekstra told one interviewer in May, neglecting to mention that the U.S. had just launched a trade war. Canada has made some necessary adjustments in response to Trump's tariffs, by the way: In March, Canadian exports to the United States declined 6.6 percent compared with the month before but rose in the rest of the world to 25 percent, making up nearly the entire difference. By April, though, the figures were more dire. Exports to America fell a staggering 16 percent and increased elsewhere by only 2.9 percent.

If recent months are any indication, the debate that most Canadians will have this July 1—between fireworks, beside the water—won't be about Canada. It will be about the United States: Is Trump the one driving America off the cliff, or is it the American people? The more hopeful among us will argue that it's Trump, and that at some point in the future, the alliance between our two countries might return to some semblance of normalcy. But for now, Canada has to figure out what to do with its terrible new freedom. We must make ourselves into something, or disappear.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

“Beautiful” it is not.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Donald Trump's signature second-term domestic legislative package, is winding its way through Congress. Republicans in the Senate and House are working on their versions, and the president hopes to sign the act into law by Independence Day.

If enacted, the OBBBA would be among the most consequential pieces of legislation in recent memory. It would cost more than Trump's COVID-rescue bill, Joe Biden's COVID-rescue bill, Trump's first-term tax cut, George W. Bush's tax cut, or Barack Obama's stimulus package; it would dwarf the Affordable Care Act in its budget impact. Still, two in three Americans say they have heard little or nothing about it.

I cannot definitively say what will end up in the legislation; no one can at this point. Elected Republicans are actively negotiating, and the Senate parliamentarian—a nonpartisan official who determines whether individual precepts are permissible, according to Congress's technical rules—is scrutinizing the proposal. Still, the OBBBA's broad strokes are clear.

The legislation is, first and foremost, a tax cut. The proposal extends the temporary tax breaks Trump enacted in his first term and creates new ones, meaning the federal government would raise roughly $4 trillion less in revenue over the coming decade. The proposal would permanently fix the top income-tax rate at 37 percent and make a number of other fiddly changes, including giving a tax break to high-income households in high-tax states and exempting mammoth inheritances from taxation. If you're looking to give $29,999,999 to your heirs, this bill is for you.

The tax code would become more regressive. By one estimate, households in the top 0.1 percent of the income distribution would get a $296,160 annual tax break. Families in the top 1 percent would retain $78,650 a year. The average family in the bottom fifth of the income distribution would get a tax cut of $160.

On the campaign trail, Trump promised to get rid of taxes on Social Security benefits. The bill does not do that. Trump also promised “no taxes on tips.” The bill creates a profession-specific, fine-print loophole for tipped income. But many hairdressers and barbacks do not earn enough to pay federal income taxes anyway, and tax professionals figure that rich people will exploit the provision by making their earnings look like tips. As the OBBBA makes the tax code more regressive, it also makes it more complicated, a boon for multinational corporations employing creative accountants and a blow for American business dynamism.

To pay for these tax cuts for rich people, the bill destabilizes the American medical system, guts anti-hunger programs, hikes utility costs, and makes education more expensive.

The bill is likely to cut billions of dollars in Medicare funding, though Trump swore he would not touch the program. It strips coverage from authorized immigrants and might trim Medicare's savings programs, which help poor seniors afford care. An older couple earning $21,000 a year could spend $8,340 more a year on premiums and out-of-pocket costs, according to one projection.

The legislation eviscerates Medicaid, stripping it of $1 trillion in financing and shrinking it by more than 10 million enrollees. The proposal would require 19 million childless adults to demonstrate that they were working or volunteering in order to qualify, and would force them to reenroll twice as often as they do now. Studies have shown that Medicaid work requirements do not raise the employment rate, because most adults on Medicaid already work if they can. They just don't have fancy white-collar jobs that come with health coverage, such as senator or president.

The proposal would limit states' ability to tax health-care providers to pay for Medicaid. The hospitals that actually pay such taxes say this is a bad idea, because it would put coverage at risk. The OBBBA would prevent states from distributing extra money to hospitals and doctors to achieve public-health goals, such as keeping remote clinics open or reducing the infant mortality rate. Republicans are currently debating a financing change that would lead to the Medicaid program more or less collapsing in nine states.

As a result of the legislation, millions of Americans will forgo medical care. A new study published in Annals of Internal Medicine estimates that 1.9 million people would lose their primary-care doctor, 1.3 million would not receive necessary medication, and 380,270 women would miss out on a mammogram, thanks to the bill. Hundreds of health clinics, hospitals, nursing homes, and long-term-care facilities would close. Republicans are scrambling to create a $25 billion fund to support rural clinics and prevent the formation of care deserts. Common sense suggests that $25 billion won't do much to offset $1 trillion in health spending cuts.

Each year, the legislation would kill 51,000 Americans, researchers at Yale have estimated.

The bill raids the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The legislation forces veterans, homeless people, and former foster youths to comply with a work requirement, and forces the states to shoulder more of the program's cost. It is likely to slash benefits for every single SNAP recipient, including 16 million children and 8 million seniors. As many as 16 million kids could lose access to free school meals too.

Similarly, the OBBBA gets rid of billions of dollars in federal financing for Americans attending college and graduate school. The Senate version of the legislation would require typical borrowers with college degrees to pay $2,929 more a year for their loans. Students who anticipated their debt being forgiven in a decade might end up having to make payments for 30 years. The legislation trashes the public-service loan-forgiveness program, which encourages nurses, doctors, and dentists to work in underserved areas.

Finally, the bill quashes the production of green energy, ripping back billions in financing Congress approved just a few years ago. Money for home-energy audits, green renovations, advanced manufacturing plants, heat pumps, electric vehicles: all gone. The bill penalizes firms constructing new solar and wind farms unless they use parts from non-Chinese manufacturers—an impossibility given China's role in the supply chain. Even a tax program for bicycle commuters gets the axe.

The bill would spur “extraordinary economic growth,” Speaker Mike Johnson argues. “That's reality.” It is not reality. The bill would have a muted effect on GDP, forecasters estimate.

The bill would pay for itself, the White House argues. It would not. The Congressional Budget Office finds that the legislation would increase the deficit by $2.8 trillion over a decade. Americans would pay billions more a year in borrowing costs.

The “big, beautiful bill” finances largesse for the rich with austerity for the poor. It will kill tens of thousands of Americans and impoverish millions more to grant million-dollar tax cuts to Trump and other billionaires. It will gut the Affordable Care Act to enrich corporations that move jobs overseas. And it will do nothing to solve the cost-of-living crisis that propelled Trump into office.

How Claire McCardell changed women's fashion

Listen to more stories on hark

Claire McCardell hated being uncomfortable. This was true long before she became one of America's most famous fashion designers in the 1950s, her influence felt in every woman's wardrobe, her face on the cover of Time magazine.

As a young girl growing up in Maryland, she hated wearing a dress when climbing trees, and didn't understand why she couldn't wear pants with pockets like her brothers—she had nowhere to put the apples she picked. At summer camp, she loathed swimming in the cumbersome full-length stockings women were expected to wear, so she ditched hers and went bare-legged in the lake, even though she knew she'd get in trouble. When she was just starting out as a fashion designer, in the 1930s, she went on a ski trip to New Hampshire and one evening saw a woman shivering in a thin satin dress. Why, McCardell wondered, couldn't an evening gown be made out of something warmer, so a woman could actually enjoy herself?

McCardell made a career out of asking such questions, and helped transform American fashion in the process, as Elizabeth Evitts Dickinson details in her lively and psychologically astute biography, Claire McCardell: The Designer Who Set Women Free. The young designer who came home from New Hampshire and devised a blue wool evening dress was often dismissed by her bosses for her “crazy” ideas—wool was for coats, not parties! She was told to keep copying the latest looks from Paris, as was customary in the American garment trade at the time. In those early years, McCardell didn't have the clout to design apparel her way. But she had a core conviction, and she never abandoned it: Women deserve to be comfortable—in their clothes, and in the world.

Almost a century later, “we owe much of what hangs in our closets to Claire McCardell,” Dickinson writes, and yet she is not among the fashion figures “we all remember.” That's an understatement. How is it that McCardell, once a household name, is now known only to fashion cognoscenti and costume historians? Dickinson offers a portrait of a revolutionary, if a private and pragmatic one, and examining McCardell's story helps expand our sense of what revolution can look like.

A glance at a list of McCardell's innovations provides a crash course in just how limited—and limiting—fashion options once were for American women. McCardell insisted on putting pockets in women's clothing; previously, pockets were reserved almost exclusively for men. (McCardell knew that pockets were good for more than holding things—they could help, she once wrote, if you were “standing in front of your boss's desk trying to look casual and composed.”) She put fasteners on the side of her clothes rather than the back, so women could get dressed without a husband or a maid. She partnered with Capezio to popularize the ballet flat—and the idea that women didn't always have to wear heels. When air travel became possible, and steamer trunks were replaced with slim suitcases, McCardell developed separates: tops and bottoms you could mix and match so that you didn't have to bring a bulky parade of dresses for every occasion. She patented the wrap dress, mainstreamed the leotard, stripped linings out of swimsuits so that women didn't have to sit sodden and cold on the beach. Ever worn denim? McCardell is the one who ignored its provenance as a humble workingman's textile and brought it to women's wear.

These ideas won McCardell early acclaim and autonomy, and though she died young (in her early 50s, of colon cancer, in 1958), she was a dominant force in American fashion for nearly 20 years. At 27, she earned the title of head designer at Townley Frocks; at 35, she negotiated to get her name on the label. She was free to unleash her most unorthodox ideas (one boss called them crazy so many times that she began wryly referring to her favorite concepts as “my crazies”). And because they were in fact quite sensible, many of them were commercial hits. She was hailed not just as a progenitor of the “American Look” but as an arbiter of American preferences: By the 1950s, she was regularly enlisted to endorse a wide spectrum of products, including playing cards, hair dye—even bourbon. When McCardell died, her New York Times obituary ran on the front page.

From her birth, in Frederick, Maryland, in 1905, she didn't lack for life's comforts, financial or otherwise, and was given unusual opportunities, as Dickinson's thoroughly researched account makes clear. McCardell's family was prosperous; her grandfather ran a candy business, her father was a banker, and her mother could afford regular trips to the local general store for fabric and seasonal visits from a seamstress who let a curious young McCardell watch every stitch she made. Fortunately, her parents believed in education for women, and they eventually agreed to supplement her stint at nearby Hood College, where she reluctantly studied home economics: In 1925, she enrolled at the New York School of Fine and Applied Art (which later became the Parsons School of Design) and headed off to study clothing illustration in New York and Paris.

What stands out in Dickinson's account is McCardell's clarity of vision, even early on. When her angora sweater left squiggles of lint on her high-school date's suit, she made note: Good clothes shouldn't create nagging little embarrassments. When she was studying in Paris and got possession of a discounted dress by the couturier Madeleine Vionnet, she immediately “took a seam ripper to it,” Dickinson writes, dismantling the precious garment so that she could understand it better, then sewing it together again. When she was back in New York, McCardell, lanky and confident, found work as a model at B. Altman, showcasing dresses on the shop floor. She ditched the prim and regal posture common at the time and walked instead with a casual, loping slouch that made each outfit look easy and appealing. Shoppers bought what she wore. (McCardell is still sometimes credited as the originator of the way models walk today.)

McCardell never approved of the then-prevailing practice of copying French designs. In the early 20th century, French designers would release new looks each season, and American merchandisers would either purchase originals to imitate, license designs they were allowed to copy, or (more often) send young women to sketch and steal the French ideas, whether from seasonal shows in Paris or from American department stores. For McCardell, the theft rankled. When one of her first bosses sent her to surreptitiously sketch French designs at Bergdorf Goodman, she snuck out to a Central Park bench to draw from her imagination instead.

She also saw that copying the French was producing a lot of bad clothes. French haute couture was custom-made, but by the 1920s, more and more American clothes were manufactured at scale and sold ready-to-wear. That meant fine French details—such as a carefully set shoulder or a delicate row of functional buttons—could be only clumsily reproduced. The effect was gawky at best, and it reinforced McCardell's focus on developing a new fashion vernacular. The question was how to get her bosses to listen.

In Dickinson's telling, Dale Carnegie himself helped McCardell cultivate her powers of persuasion. McCardell first heard Carnegie's self-improvement spiel at a gathering of the Fashion Group, a trade association for women in the industry, and then signed up for courses at his Institute of Effective Speaking. Just after these lessons, in 1938, she scored her first big win. (Dickinson can't resist extracting perhaps too-tidy significance from other encounters with 20th-century heroes as well: When McCardell watches Charles Lindbergh's plane land in Paris after his pioneering transatlantic flight, for example, she finds her faith in American pluck and ingenuity buoyed.)

Carnegie-inspired or not, McCardell's first triumph came when she was lead designer at Townley, constantly battling pushback from her boss there, Henry Geiss. He fought her on pockets. When she declined to include shoulder pads, the French vogue, he had the workroom tuck them in later. Her newest idea: a voluminous dress, narrow at the shoulders and wide at the hem, simple to cut and easy to manufacture, that could be belted in a number of ways and would be flattering to women of all shapes and sizes. When a woman wore it, she felt effortless, elegant, and free. On the hanger, though, it looked like a sack. Geiss said it would never sell and refused to include it in the line.

And so, Dickinson recounts, on the day a buyer from Best & Co., a New York department store, was in the showroom, McCardell turned up in her own trapeze-style dress, cut in a rich red wool, and strode through bearing coffee as the buyer was packing up. “You didn't show me that one,” the buyer from Best & Co. said, and ordered 100 on the spot. (Whether this encounter was coincidence or contrived is open to interpretation, and Dickinson acknowledges in a footnote that the tale has “several versions”; she relies on her archival work and the analysis of previous biographers to support the staged-coffee-run version of events.) However it was discovered, the dress, which became known as the “Monastic” because its loose cut recalled a monk's robe, sold out in a day and became a national sensation. “Geiss is such a dope,” McCardell told her friends.

Soon after, Townley went out of business: Geiss had spent a year in combat with copycats rather than encouraging McCardell to come up with the next great idea. A year later, he revived the brand with a new partner, Adolph Klein, and asked McCardell to return. When she insisted on having her name on the label, and final say on the designs, Klein and Geiss agreed. The year was 1940. The Germans had invaded France, Parisian fashion had shut down, and manufacturers and merchandisers were wondering: Could America get dressed by itself?

McCardell thrived because of her timing, and because her new partner, Klein, was a marketing whiz who knew how to sell her distinctive designs. It may have helped, too, that she waited until she was established to marry and never had children of her own. But she succeeded above all because she never stopped thinking about how her customers would feel in their clothes. “When you're uncomfortable, you are likely to show it,” she told a radio interviewer in 1947. Clothes should be easy to wear, “so there is no temptation to be forever pulling, pinching, and adjusting them, which spoils your own fun and makes everyone else fidgety. You never look really well-dressed when you're over-conscious of what you have on.”

Fashion historians tend to agree that McCardell had a distinctively elegant and inventive knack for bringing American women new freedom of movement. She rejected anything restricting—even when Christian Dior burst onto the French scene with his “New Look” after World War II and began trussing women back into corsets with 18-inch waists. Dior described women as flowers, to be admired and plucked. McCardell saw women as doers, and designed accordingly. She often used kimono or dolman sleeves, favoring the loose arm openings that allowed a woman to “raise her arm above her head to hold a strap on the subway or hail a taxi without worrying about ripping a seam,” as Dickinson writes. Her cuts were unusual and modern, which is why costume institutes prize her work and fashion instructors still pore over her techniques.

Whether McCardell was really “the designer who set women free” in a broader sense is a more complicated question. During McCardell's lifetime, women certainly gained sartorial freedom: more casual and comfortable options; more economical ones; more revealing ones; and in general, more choice about how they might acceptably present themselves to the world. But McCardell was part of a cohort of American designers who helped invent American sportswear—casual clothes suited to Americans' active lives. Dickinson carefully nods at this landscape, introducing us to other influential innovators in fashion such as the Lord & Taylor executive Dorothy Shaver, who featured female American designers' lines in her store windows long before McCardell made her name. The 1955 Time cover story that featured McCardell cites a list of even more forgotten peers who were pushing fashion forward as well, none of whom gets more than scant mention in Dickinson's account: Sydney Wragge, who is also sometimes credited with inventing modern separates; Clare Potter, who popularized two-piece swimsuits; Vera Maxwell, who also thought clothes should be comfortable; Carolyn Schnurer, who told The New York Times that pockets give women “something to do with their hands.”

Perhaps McCardell is best thought of not as a singular visionary but as a leading voice in a chorus of designers, all responding to the growth of mass manufacturing; to the uniquely American assumption—both democratic and consumerist—that women up and down the income scale deserved to dress well; and to the huge opportunity presented when France went dark during the war. The changing lives of American women gave rise to the demand for these new clothes, and if McCardell had not existed, another talent would no doubt have seized the moment.

That doesn't make her any less of a revolutionary, and she is semiregularly reexamined by the fashion world because her geometrically novel designs appeal to the eye in different eras. Three years ago, Tory Burch launched a collection inspired by McCardell and wrote the foreword to a rerelease of What Shall I Wear?, a fashion-advice book that McCardell published (and wrote at least some of) in 1956.

The real reason the larger world doesn't know McCardell's name is that, unlike her rival and contemporary Christian Dior, she did not designate a successor or make any plan for her line to continue after her death. Dior also died at 52, just a few months before McCardell, having appointed Yves Saint Laurent to carry on his work and safeguard his name. But it's worth considering what a fashion legacy entails: Do we know Dior's name because we understand his art? Or have we merely seen it on the side of sunglasses and in bus-shelter perfume ads?

Perhaps fashion is better understood not as art, but as a form of industrial design. I don't know the name of the man who invented the potato peeler, but I benefit from his efforts at least twice a week. McCardell fought for recognition in her lifetime, but she seemed to want it less for glory and more because it gave her the power to operate as she liked. She might take a look at our modern closets, our ballet flats and wrap dresses, separates and side zippers, and conclude that she did enough, whether we know her name or not.

But McCardell is worth remembering as an example of the persistence called for, in any field, to see the world as it is—and to fight for the world as it should be. In 2021, her hometown in Maryland installed a statue of her in a local park. She slouches in her signature posture, confident and at ease, leaning back against a dressmaker's form. It's striking to see an official statue that looks so relaxed; she's not staring at the horizon as though meeting the queen, or setting the coordinates for an artillery attack. She looks, above all, comfortable.

Protests show people they are not alone in caring about an issue.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

A protest can be a fine way to get people's attention—particularly the attention of those in positions of power. But one of the most important, and most overlooked, functions of protest is to prevent the dreaded “spiral of silence,” which can begin when people wrongly believe that their own point of view is not widely shared.

When political speech is considered socially sensitive or politically dangerous, people are more likely to sit out protests, mute themselves online, and keep quiet in everyday conversation. These small acts of silencing may seem merely polite or indifferent, but they can easily spiral.

People sometimes take as many cues from silence as they do from noise. And because people interpret silence to mean quiet acceptance or approval of the status quo, they use it to inform their own decisions about whether to speak out. Silence begets silence, which begets further misunderstanding about what a society actually collectively believes or wants.

Political and psychological scientists like me who study this phenomenon have found that a “spiral of silence” is one way that unpopular policies and regimes persist. One major reason is a muted, acquiescent public—the proverbial people watching the naked emperor's parade.

Recent psychological research on public opinion regarding climate change has shown how wrong Americans can be about one another's beliefs. For example: What percentage of Americans is at least somewhat concerned about climate change? Recently, a representative group of more than 6,000 Americans answered this question. On average, they guessed that less than half of Americans—only 43 percent—worry about climate change. In their eyes, a clear majority of Americans is unconcerned. This is not true, however. In actuality, 66 percent of Americans report worrying about climate change.

Listen: Who really protests–and why?

This massive underestimate also extends to Americans' perceptions of support for various climate policies aimed at slowing climate change. The survey, fielded by an interuniversity team of psychologists led by the psychologist Gregg Sparkman, asked people to estimate the amount of support among Americans for a carbon tax, mandates that electricity be generated by renewable energy, wind and solar infrastructure on public lands, and support for the Green New Deal. Average guesses for support of these policies ranged from 37 to 43 percent. In reality, 66 to 80 percent of Americans support these policies. The researchers noted in their findings that supporters of climate policies “outnumber opponents two to one, while Americans falsely perceive nearly the opposite to be true.” Americans are living in a “false social reality,” they concluded, when it comes to climate-change opinions.

By now, we all know something about reality's tenuousness—we're bombarded with information but very frequently left grasping to figure out what is actually true. Layer on uncertainty about what others believe, and you'll find yourself in a “false social reality” where you conclude that you are in the minority of people who care about a given issue. Such a misperception can make you lose hope for solutions, or discourage you from speaking up or acting. In the case of climate change, Americans also lose hope because they believe that opposition to climate policy is based on hostile partisan polarization. But hostile partisan polarization on this issue also turns out to be larger in perception than in reality.

In another study, this one by the psychologists David Sherman and Leaf Van Boven, participants guessed that Americans would support two climate policies—cap-and-trade and revenue-neutral carbon policy—if their own party proposed them, but not if they were proposed by the other party. This is a reasonable assumption in a highly polarized society. But for Democrats, this was incorrect—Democratic participants reported support for the climate policies whether they were proposed by a Democratic or a Republican lawmaker. Republican participants were unsupportive of climate policies if they were proposed by a Democrat, but Democratic participants overestimated their opposition, which was closer to “no support” than “active opposition.”

The fact that organized protest can break the spiral of silence, and correct our impressions of what other Americans think, is one of the most immediate and important values of protesting in the first place. My own research and the research of other social scientists have repeatedly documented instances from recent American history in which protest updated our impressions of what other citizens believe.

For example, about three years ago, on June 24, 2022, protests broke out after the Supreme Court ruled, in Dobbs v. Jackson, that the federal government should not guarantee a right to legal access to abortion, overturning the precedent set by Roe v. Wade 50 years prior. A group of my colleagues and I, led by Chelsey Clark, had already been surveying Americans regarding their personal beliefs about abortion (Do you support legal access to abortion?) and other Americans' beliefs (How many Americans do you think support access to abortion?). We found that following the Supreme Court decision, Americans' beliefs about abortion barely budged, but their perceptions of other Americans' beliefs were different. Despite the fact that the Court had just ruled against legal access to abortion, Americans were more likely to perceive that other Americans supported legal access.

What caused people to update their impressions of what Americans believe? In my research, we connected this change to their exposure to protest and dissent. Social media and traditional media were filled with images of people marching against the ruling. Analyzing millions of Twitter impressions and tweets, we found that the sentiment of tweets about the ruling were much more negative than positive. It also helped that more than 4 million of the tweets shared links to polling data indicating that a majority of Americans supported legalized abortion access, a fact that journalistic institutions also reported widely at the time.

Scholars of the Supreme Court have theorized that Court rulings can change public opinion, and even our impressions of what other Americans think. In fact, in our own prior work, led by Margaret Tankard, we studied the public-opinion impact of the Supreme Court's Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, which legalized same-sex marriage. Across the partisan divide and among older and younger men and women, our survey respondents did not change their own beliefs about same-sex marriage. However, their perceptions of other Americans' beliefs changed: In the days and months following the ruling, they perceived that other Americans had increased their approval of same-sex marriage. This shift in their perception of other Americans was big—as big as the actual shift in personal opinions approving of same-sex marriage over the past 15 years among Baby Boomers.

You might recall that in the days following the ruling, there was another kind of American demonstration. Or, at least, you might remember the rainbows. Americans' social-media feeds lit up in rainbows; Google posted a rainbow banner across its search page; and at night, the White House was bathed in rainbow lights. There was a great deal of media coverage of weddings (which also featured rainbows). Long-time couples rushed to courthouses and city halls, and local news was full of videos and pictures of happy couples crying and holding hands. The celebrations were hard to miss.

In both cases, Americans heard about the Supreme Court ruling, and then looked around at the people in the streets, on their televisions, and on social media. After Obergefell v. Hodges, people observed the immediate, widespread celebrations and perceived more support for same-sex marriage than they had before the ruling. After Dobbs v. Jackson, Americans again looked around at their social world and inferred from the widespread protest, discontent, and polling evidence shared on Twitter that Americans were more supportive of legal access to abortion than they'd previously thought.

Neither of these studies assessed whether Americans' perception had updated to a perfectly accurate view of public opinion—we did not ask participants to estimate the percentage of supporters for either issue. Rather, these studies imply that Americans' perceptions of public opinion changed in the direction of the public demonstrations, not in the direction of the Court rulings. Another recent data collection—by me and my colleagues—reinforces this point. After the Supreme Court ruled in two cases—Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina—against the use of race-based affirmative action in higher education, there was very little public protest. We found that survey participants again updated their perceptions of what Americans think about affirmative action—immediately after the ruling, they thought that Americans supported it less. In this case, the Court ruling was accompanied by relative silence. People take cues from silence.

Read: Do protests even work?

Michael Suk-Young Chwe is a political scientist who studies how public rallies, demonstrations, and parades can all be used to build “common knowledge”—not just a shared understanding of what is true but an awareness of both other people's opinions and the fact that those people know our opinions. Because rallies and demonstrations are a form of “symbolic resistance,” they can be underestimated, Chwe acknowledges. But they build our common knowledge, because we are all observing one another watch the spectacle.

There is a class of people who do not underestimate symbolic gatherings in public: those who wish to seize and retain power. Evidence for this point stretches back to the Tudor kings and queens of 16th-century England, who paraded to various locations outside their court to be seen by their subjects. Although anthropologists have analyzed these local processions (or “progresses,” to use the term favored by historians) as direct acts of power in which monarchs such as Queen Elizabeth I marked each outlying territory as belonging to the Crown. Chwe points out that the underappreciated value of these parades were the “crowds of astonished peasants.” The audiences that gathered were not just watching the Queen—they were watching other people watch the Queen.

American leaders also believe in common knowledge. Many Americans can still recall President Richard Nixon's famous 1969 speech asserting that a “silent majority” supported his Vietnam War policy, in contrast to the loud minority showing up to anti-war protests. President Barack Obama, in his 2009 speech presenting his health-care plan to a joint session of Congress, reminded the public that “a strong majority of Americans still favor a public insurance option.” Today, President Donald Trump reflexively advertises and exaggerates the size of the crowds at his rallies and inaugurations, and introduces rumors with the phrase many people are saying.  In advance of his Washington, D.C., military parade, which coincided with the nationwide “No Kings Day” protests, Trump claimed that he “hadn't heard of any protests,” but threatened a “very heavy response” to any protesters at his parade.

Of course, not all types of protests cause the public to update their impressions of public opinion in the direction of their cause. Violent protests, or media coverage that falsely frames protests as violent when they are not, can lead the public to view protesters as representatives of fringe or extremist viewpoints. As the political scientist Omar Wasow finds in the context of the civil-rights movement, protester-initiated violence can backfire in subsequent elections. It is for this reason that elites who are being challenged through protest often seek to frame protesters as violent or, Nixon-like, as part of a “vocal minority.” The challenge for protest organizers is to present a large, peaceful show of opinion that is not easily reframed or misrepresented by elites or by the echo chambers of social and partisan mass media.

In his book Rational Ritual: Culture, Coordination, and Common Knowledge, Chwe quotes the renowned social theorist Jürgen Habermas: “The fundamental phenomenon of power is not the instrumentalization of another's will, but the formation of a common will.” What do other Americans believe? To know, we look around for a public signal.

Politics is a challenge for human coordination. People want to participate in political action only if others do as well. Those who believe in self-governance must signal to other people that they wish to participate, that they believe in one form of politics or another. We must watch one another—not just through social media or a news channel—to learn what we believe. And we must be willing to speak up ourselves. This is the way to form common knowledge about what other Americans truly think and want. And this is the underappreciated value of protests. To paraphrase the political scientist Diana Mutz: they don't tell us what to think, but they tell us what other people think.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

A noirish novel set in the world of strip clubs and BDSM dungeons ventures beyond titillation and into the daily grind.

Twenty years ago, a reader looking for taboo sex in print had to slink to the back of the bookstore and make whispered inquiries. Today, kinky books make up an established genre, one that shares front-table space with other major releases and possesses its own classics and conventions. This robust menagerie encompasses pulpy household names, including E. L. James's Fifty Shades of Grey, which in 2011 vaulted BDSM onto the New York Times fiction best-seller list. It has a literary canon—Marquis de Sade's Justine, Pauline Réage's Story of O—and elevated LGBTQ smut standards such as Patrick Califia's Macho Sluts. Over in the nonfiction aisle are more practical selections, a hefty cascade of volumes that explore kink from all angles: how-to, history, philosophy, psychology, memoir.

The expansion of the genre tracks the broadening acceptability of erotic inclinations that were previously pathologized (and, at times, criminalized). The 2013 edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) hastened this shift by redefining certain practices, including “BDSM, fetishism, and transvestic fetishism (a variant of cross-dressing),” as behaviors rather than illnesses, according to an Atlantic article: “Consenting adults were no longer deemed mentally ill for choosing sexual behavior outside the mainstream.”

As stigma recedes, the subculture meets the marketplace. While fiction continues to revel in fantasy and the forbidden, nonfiction is bending toward demystifying and normalizing BDSM. The latter form tends to emphasize the community credo of being “safe, sane, and consensual.” It also participates in a broader project: staking out a claim to legitimacy by assuring the public that deviance is, paradoxically, normal. Redefining the transgressive as conventional might feel self-contradictory, but the pursuit of acceptance is as strong a human impulse as the appetite for risk. Call it a respectability kink.

Fiction still offers more freedom to roam outside the bounds of propriety, and the most ambitious kink novels venture beyond titillation. The author Brittany Newell sails over the guardrail between fantasy and reality with her second novel, Soft Core, by centering it on a protagonist, Ruth, and a setting, San Francisco's sex industry, that are both lively and deeply believable. Ruth is known as “Baby” at the strip club where she works, an ever-chugging factory of arousal in which wigs and fake names and alternative personas are accessed on the fly to suit customer caprice. All this quick-change artistry offers her a welcome distraction from her existential fears, including the anxiety that her master's thesis, on surveillance, ghosts, and reality TV, was a waste of time. Having started out as something of an accidental sugar baby at 24, she is now 27. “Youth made my general aimlessness cute,” she thinks. “Without it, I was just a bad investment.”

As someone with professional knowledge of Bay Area strip clubs and dungeons—having worked in them during that same phase of my own life—I understood that although Ruth is haunted by many things, chief among them is the ticking of the clock. Slipping from Ruth to “Baby” at the club gives her both an escape hatch from her Saturn-return blues and a whole new set of problems.

Read: BDSM versus the DSM

Strip clubs aren't really on the kink continuum, but I'd argue that the customer-dancer dynamic is its own form of advanced, high-stakes role-playing. BDSM is definitely an element, for instance, in Baby's relationship with her client Simon, a lonely cipher who PayPals her $800 a month for outré sexual indulgences, then later beseeches her to delete him from her phone.

Newell's gifts for sensory details (a dancer “smelled like crème brûlée”; a woman's mouth is “like a Slurpee: endless, red and wet”) and for tracing the wavy contours of human connection make her work feel like that of a glitter-bomb David Lynch. Things get wavier still when she wakes one morning to find that her ex-boyfriend Dino, a dashing, fastidious ketamine dealer who loves his dogs and lounges around in elegant women's lingerie, has vanished from the Victorian flat they share.

Within a week of Dino's disappearance, the gamine and eerily familiar Emeline starts dancing at Ruth's club. Like a pampered duckling, Emeline imprints on Ruth, even hunting down her signature perfume—the titular Soft Core, which, as a besotted customer once gushed, makes Ruth “smell like a library in ancient Egypt.” Newell's story begins to simmer with noirish detail: mysterious notes appearing in Ruth's belongings; bizarre anonymous emails materializing in her inbox; fast drives on twisty streets; fog rolling in and out, an enigmatic character unto itself. Ruth keeps thinking that she spies Dino everywhere. But does she?

To fill the empty hours without Dino, Ruth takes on an additional hustle as “Sunday,” a dominatrix for hire at the Dream House, which is not so much a dungeon as “a pea-green four-bedroom house in a quiet cul-de-sac.” There, she broadens her client base as a compassionate consort to men who prefer to indulge darker fantasies. These include Albert. In front of Ruth, he takes on an alternative persona, named “Allie,” who claims that Albert is her sugar daddy. Ruth doesn't remark on the irony of tending to an affluent sex-work client who is cosplaying as a sex worker.

Ruth assumes—incorrectly—that she can take Dino's disappearance in stride by overworking, given, as she puts it, her “native ability to absorb any trauma like it was just one more step in my skin-care routine. Wake up at five, wash face, stare into void, moisturize.” (I snort-laughed in recognition.) She learns, as the days pass, that dissociative endurance is not necessarily a positive attribute, and that sadness can seep into any space—VIP room, dungeon chamber—as if rising through the floorboards.

Although her rootlessness and sorrow originate from experiences that predate her lover's departure, Ruth wonders if these haunting feelings are exacerbated by her profession. “Maybe my work was partly to blame,” she thinks. “I'd been method-acting as a dream girl, and now I couldn't touch back down to earth.” Newell skillfully renders the exhaustion of sex work, especially the weird repetitiveness of trying to keep things exciting and new for clients. Years ago in Los Angeles, one friend of mine, a kink impresario who was winding down from a draining day of video shoots by sorting through a rucksack full of black and red leather floggers, sighed to me: “It's not the sex; it's the work.”

In interviews, Newell has shared that the scenes set at the Dream House are modeled on her own experience. As a Stanford graduate who published her first novel, Oola, an obsessive love story, when she was 21, Newell might strike the reader as a hyper-literate Persephone: equally adept at chronicling the velvety, narcotic appeal of the “libidinal underworld” and the bell-clang wake-up calls that chase off the escapist high. Her admixture of emotion, intellect, and erotic perceptivity achieves what nonfiction writers—sincere sex positivists and edgy academics alike—often fail at: an explication of the psychology of kink that maintains the heat of intrigue.

Soft Core is more a study in feeling-tones than a tightly plotted thriller. It's a trippy excursion down the rabbit hole into a particular substratum of culture, maintaining a tether to the “real” world while burrowing out to the misty shoreline where it's hard to tell horizon from sky. Each subplot sounds a distant foghorn of loneliness.

As Ruth turns 28, she begins to see that she can't be sustained by a hail of compliments and cash and evanescent male companions. That's not a life; that's a never-ending ghost hunt. This book's growth arc doesn't depend on Ruth/Baby/Sunday finding someone or something she's looking for; it lands on her figuring out what she herself lacks. Transactional fascination pales next to devotion—but you need the eyes to see it.

Read: Is one of the most-cited statistics about sex work wrong?

Soft Core is also a novel about a city. San Francisco has always been a frontier town—a place to pursue an outlier dream. Before it became, as Ruth observes, a “seasick city of data and drugs” that drew hordes of gentrifying tech evangelists, people came seeking queer liberation and a vibrant leather community. And before that: punks, hippies, Beats, and on back to prospectors panning for gold. Many San Francisco seekers find themselves contending with the sour note of the utopian quest. As a canny cartographer of want, Newell takes her place among the city's storied sexual intelligentsia. Though at times her eye for the awkwardness of interrelation points to Mary Gaitskill, she's more a descendent of Danielle Willis, the latex-clad poet whose Zeitgeist Press book, Dogs in Lingerie, gave voice to San Francisco's spooky, kink-conversant stripper narrators 30-plus years ago.

Outsiders often deride kink for both its earnestness and its deviance. The same can be said of sex work. In the words of the San Francisco–based sexologist Carol Queen, “Trashing other people's sexual vision is so common. It's the highbrow's lowest road.” But the elusiveness of something (respect, satiety, understanding) often only makes you crave it more, and Soft Core shows us the magnetizing, if at times humbling, pull of raw need. “Nothing lasts forever,” Ruth muses. “Except, of course, longing.” That is a frontier that some of us will always be chasing. I guess some girls are just kinky that way.

Kids on bikes once filled the streets. Not anymore.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Walk down a quiet American street a few decades ago, and chances were good that you'd come across a vision of the Spielbergian sort: a gaggle of school-age children charging down the block on bikes, armed with a steely sense of purpose, and without any protective headwear.

You're less likely to catch that kind of scene today. Over the course of the 1990s, an average of 20.5 million children ages 7 to 17 hopped on a bike six or more times a year, according to data from the National Sporting Goods Association, a sports-equipment trade group. Only a few decades later, that number has fallen by nearly half, to about 10.9 million in 2023. Of those kids, according to the association, just less than 5 percent rode their bikes “frequently.”

With this decline, kids are losing more than a potential mode of transport. Biking supports children's independence and overall health in a way that many activities cannot. It's a great way to get moving and build strength, and can improve coordination and balance. Like many types of fitness, it can help reduce children's future chances of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. But compared with some of the other ways that children get exercise, such as team sports, it's much more affordable (especially if you buy a used bike) and, crucially—once kids are trained—doesn't require as much effort from adults.

The thought of their kids traveling solo might get some parents wringing their hands, and for good reason. Biking can be risky, and finding an appropriate place to practice can be tricky in the city or in the suburbs. But if parents can find safe environments for teaching their children to navigate streets confidently on their own, the amount of freedom those kids will gain is invaluable. On a bike, a child gets to choose where to go and how to get there without having to check in with a parent, which lets them practice making decisions. As they ride more, the activity can even start to rewire their brain, helping them form spatial maps of their neighborhood and develop the kind of competence and knowledge that can seed lasting resilience and self-esteem.

Kids aren't the only ones who benefit when they start getting around on two wheels. When enough children bike—or simply get outside—whole neighborhoods can be transformed. Research has shown that when children play in the open, whether they're riding a bike, kicking a ball, or merely puttering, parents feel more of a connection to their neighbors, and many people begin to feel safer.

Read: What adults lost when kids stopped playing in the street

As fewer kids venture out, however, neighborhoods can lose those social ties. Many people blame smartphones for this trend. But as Esther Walker, the research leader at the nonprofit youth-cycling organization Outride, told me, “I've never read or heard a student say they just would prefer to be on their phone.” Kids do want to bike, Nancy Pullen-Seufert, the director of the government-funded program the National Center for Safe Routes to School, told me—but conditions on many streets don't exactly inspire confidence. Walker regularly speaks with middle schoolers in Outride's programs, and she told me that although they crave mobility, many also say that the traffic in their neighborhood makes riding too dangerous or that their parents won't let them go on their own.

In many places, this fear is well founded. American roadways have gotten faster and busier. Since the 1990s, speed limits have ticked upward. Each year (minus a few temporary dips), drivers have progressively clocked more collective miles and driven ever larger cars. According to a 2023 report by the nonprofit Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, “Over the past 30 years, the average U.S. passenger vehicle has gotten about 4 inches wider, 10 inches longer, 8 inches taller and 1,000 pounds heavier.” These machines may be protecting drivers and passengers, but they can be much more intimidating to people on bikes. The annual number of children killed on bikes has actually fallen, a 2021 CDC report found, but the report acknowledges that this is likely in part because fewer kids are out riding. The decrease in kids' deaths seems reflective not of streets' safety—an SUV, the most dominant car in the U.S. market, is eight times more likely than a sedan to kill a child—but rather of parents' understanding of the danger that big cars pose.

Families haven't always had to be this vigilant. Children in previous decades may not have had designated bike lanes, complete sidewalks, or other protective features now common on many American roads. But they had more space to wander, fewer and slower cars to contend with, and safety in numbers as throngs of children dependably roamed about the neighborhood. It wasn't until public planning began to prioritize cars that children lost not only areas to play but also the freedom to get to places on their own. Tellingly, the share of K–8 students walking or biking to school fell from 48 percent in 1969 to just 13 percent in 2009, according to a 2011 report prepared by the National Center for Safe Routes to School.

Read: An e-bike transformed my family's life

By adding more bike-friendly infrastructure—lower traffic speeds, separated bike lanes, calmer intersections—local governments could encourage children and other residents to start riding again. In the interim, teaching children how to share the road with drivers is mostly up to caregivers. Finding safe-enough spots for practice might be tough in some cities. But with a little creativity, parents can track down dead ends, streets closed to cars, unused parking lots, or parks with paved pathways to let their kids spread out and find their bearings in relatively calm surroundings.

Putting in that work may demand more of parents in the short term. But as a mom whose 9-year-old recently began riding, I would argue that the investment of time and attention is worth it. In my reporting, I've heard over and over from parents about how desperately they want to raise confident and resilient kids. Many opt for a packed calendar of extracurriculars, most of which require an adult to act as chauffeur and supervisor. Yet kids don't tend to flourish when they're being shuttled around and monitored by adults. What many need is a bit more freedom: time to do as they please, to peddle aimlessly—until, one day, they're ready to take off.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

It combines budget-busting tax cuts and painful social program cuts.

Republicans are barreling ahead to try to pass President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” — legislation that somehow manages to combine massive fiscal irresponsibility with devastating spending cuts.

The bill would keep the “Trump tax cuts” originally passed in 2017 in place, while adding some new tax breaks and new spending on immigration enforcement and the military.

It would also make deep cuts to government spending on Medicaid, the clean energy industry, student loans, and food stamps, though exactly how deep these cuts will be isn't yet clear, as the GOP continues to debate the bill.

Yet under any scenario, these cuts will be insufficient to get anywhere near covering the bill's massive cost — one estimate suggests it will add $3.9 trillion to the debt.

Republicans are trying to rely on only their party's votes to pass it through Congress and hope to send it to Trump's desk this week. Democrats are uniformly opposed.

On Monday, the Senate began considering amendments on its version of the bill (the House passed its own version last month). But much remains unsettled as they attempt to hammer out a final compromise.

Trump is pushing hard to ram this bill through because he wants to take care of four things at once.

First, if Congress does nothing, the lower income tax rates Trump signed into law in 2017 are set to expire at the end of this year. That would mean higher taxes for practically everyone — a political disaster.

Second, the bill fulfills a few Trump campaign promises by creating some tax breaks, such as new tax deductions for tip wages and overtime pay.

Third, the bill includes new spending on immigration enforcement (such as Trump's border wall) and certain military priorities (like his planned “Golden Dome” missile defense shield).

Fourth, the bill raises the US debt ceiling — the limit on new debt the government can issue, which Congress periodically squabbles over raising — by $5 trillion.

All of this tax cutting and new spending is very expensive — it amounts to about $5 trillion over the next decade. So the bill also does some spending cuts: about $1 trillion. These cuts are overwhelmingly targeted at Democratic or liberal-coded priorities and constituencies.

For one, Medicaid would be cut deeply — perhaps by as much as 18 percent, due to new work reporting requirements and other changes that the Congressional Budget Office estimates would push 12 million people off the program.

The clean energy industry would also be hammered. The current Senate bill not only rolls back Biden-era tax credits but also imposes a painful new tax on wind or solar projects using Chinese components.

Student loans and food stamps are the other areas that would face particularly steep cuts. 

The exact extent of all these cuts is yet to be determined. Some in the GOP are seeking to soften the Medicaid and clean energy cuts at least somewhat, but conservative hardliners are pressing to slash spending even more. 

The public spectacle this week will be on the Senate floor as amendments get votes, but the real action will happen behind the scenes as GOP leaders attempt to cut a deal that can win over nearly every House and Senate Republican.

Beware of the biting midge.

Oropouche virus disease was a relatively rare illness for decades, lurking on the margins of tropical rainforests in the Caribbean and South America. 

Sporadic reports of an infection causing fevers, coughs, chills, and body aches emerged among people living near or moving into the jungle. A tiny insect called a midge spreads the disease, and the earliest known case dates back to 1955 in a forest worker near a village called Vega de Oropouche in Trinidad. Since most people who were infected with the virus recovered on their own and since cases were so infrequent, it barely registered as a public health concern. 

But a few years ago, something changed. 

A major Oropouche fever outbreak beginning in 2023 infected at least 23,000 people across Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Peru. It wasn't just confined to remote wilderness areas but was spreading in metropolises like Rio de Janeiro. In some cases, travelers were infected and then brought the virus home: So far, Oropouche fever has sprung up in the US, Canada, and Europe in people returning from the afflicted region. The outbreak has killed at least five people. 

The sudden rise of Oropouche disease startled scientists and health officials. Since its discovery, there have only been around 500,000 known cases. By contrast, there are upward of 400 million dengue infections each year. It's likely then that many more Oropouche infections have gone undetected, especially since its symptoms overlap with those from other diseases and there's little active screening for the virus. 

Now, researchers are looking back at the outbreak to try to find out what they missed and what lessons they can apply to get ahead of future epidemics. Oropouche virus is a critical case study in the complicated factors that drive vector-borne diseases. Dynamics like deforestation, urban sprawl, international travel, and gaps in surveillance are converging to drive up the dangers from infections spread by animals. 

And as the climate changes, new regions are becoming more hospitable to the blood suckers that spread these diseases, increasing the chances of these seemingly-remote infections making it to the US and getting established. That means more people will face threats from illnesses that they may never have considered before. 

“It's very likely that these public health problems that people before called ‘tropical disease' are not so tropical anymore and are basically everywhere,” said William de Souza, who studies arboviruses — viruses spread by arthropods like insects — at the University of Kentucky. “Vector-borne disease is not a local problem; this is a global problem.”

The rising specter of Oropouche fever comes at a time when the United States is cutting funding for research at universities, pulling back from studying vector-borne disease threats, and ending collaborations with other countries to limit their risk.

The Oropouche virus belongs to the family of bunyaviruses. They appear as spheres under a microscope, and they encode their genomes in RNA, rather than DNA as human cells do. RNA viruses tend to have high mutation rates, making it harder to target them with vaccines and increasing the odds of reinfection. Oropuche's relatives include the viruses behind Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, spread by ticks, and Rift Valley fever, spread by mosquitoes. 

Oropouche spreads mainly through the bites of a 1- to 3-millimeter-long insect called, appropriately, a biting midge (Culicoides paraensis). Midges are sometimes called sand flies or no-see-ums in the US, and they breed in damp soil, rotting vegetation, and standing water. Like mosquitoes, they feed on blood to drive their reproduction, but their minuscule bodies can easily slip through mosquito nets. When a midge bites an infected host, it can pass on the pathogen to a human during a subsequent bite. There's also evidence that the virus may be sexually transmissible, but no such cases have been documented yet. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that male travelers from regions where Oropouche is spreading should not have sex for six weeks if they show symptoms of the disease. 

Vector-borne diseases like Oropouche continue to surprise us because there are so many variables that have to align in order to spread them — the pathogens, the vectors, the hosts, and the environment. 

Unlike diseases like Covid-19 or influenza, vector-borne illnesses don't spread directly from person to person. Instead, they require an animal, often arthropods like ticks, midges, and mosquitoes. The range, reproduction, and behavior of these organisms add another confounding factor in the spread of the diseases they carry. Globally, vector-borne diseases account for 17 percent of infectious diseases, leading to more than 700,000 deaths per year, according to the World Health Organization. But not every part of the world is equally vulnerable. 

In cooler regions, vector-borne infections are often a minor public health concern, but in countries like Brazil, “it's at the top,” said Tatiane Moraes de Sousa, a researcher at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) in Rio de Janeiro. “Oropouche before 2024 was concentrated just in the Amazon. Last year, we saw the spreading of Oropuche in almost all Brazilian states.”

That gets to the first obstacle in tracking Oropouche: Which animals are the reservoirs for the virus and where are they? So far, researchers have detected the virus in animals including sloths, capuchin monkeys, marmosets, domestic birds, and rodents. These organisms form what's known as the sylvatic, or forest, cycle of the virus. How the virus jumps between all these animals and which ones are most concerning for people is not known. 

Additionally, it may be possible that other insects may be able to carry the Oropouche virus, but it's not clear whether they can spread it to humans. 

The pattern that does emerge is that when people spend more time inside and around the fringes of tropical rainforests, where the animals that harbor the virus and the insects that spread them reside, they're more likely to get infected. With deforestation and development, more people are moving into areas where the disease naturally spreads. 

“This is a classical example of how human behavior can lead to the emergence of a pathogen,” said Natasha Tilston, who studies Oropouche virus at the Indiana University School of Medicine. 

People can travel great distances, and as people move back and forth from the wilderness to cities, they can unwittingly carry viruses like Oropouche. If enough of them gather in cities where vectors are present, they can trigger an urban epidemic cycle as the virus travels from person to midge to person. This was likely the pattern in the 2023–2024 outbreak in major cities in South America. 

It's also true that more health workers were on guard for Oropouche and thus identified more infections. “The outbreak is probably a combination of one, there are more cases, and two, we're also looking for a lot more than we did before,” Tilston said, noting that some past outbreaks of dengue may have actually been Oropouche as well. 

One factor is that the virus likely evolved. Viruses mutate all the time, and most mutations are either inconsequential or detrimental to the virus, slowing or stopping its reproduction. But occasionally, a change can confer an advantage or make the pathogen more destructive. The Oropouche virus has a genome structure that makes it even more prone to a type of mutation called reassortment. 

“Reassortment is when you have two similar viruses infect the same cell and they mix genomes,” explained University of Kentucky's de Souza. “People previously infected by the old virus are now susceptible to new infection. This could help explain why the Amazon region, where this has been circulated for a long time, saw this emerge, because people were probably reinfected.” 

The strain behind the outbreak appears to reproduce faster and cause more severe illness than prior varieties as well. 

Part of the reason this outbreak racked up so many infected people is that health officials were starting to deploy the tools to identify on a wider scale. Particularly in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, more health departments across the region built up their tools to detect viruses.

But researchers still aren't sure exactly what spurred the virus to spread so suddenly across so many countries. Travel restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic started relaxing in 2023 and made it easier for people to move back and forth from the rural areas where the virus is endemic to the cities where it became established. 

The 2023–2024 outbreak also coincided with a powerful El Niño event that brought gargantuan amounts of rain and triggered unprecedented flooding across many parts of South America. These were also years that set new temperature records. Higher temperatures can speed up the reproduction of the virus inside midges. But scientists aren't exactly sure how this heat and water affected the vectors, though Brazil has seen outbreaks of other infectious diseases in the aftermath of floods. 

“El Niño and other climate phenomena have been associated with the change of the patterns of many different vector-borne diseases,” de Souza said. “For Oropouche specifically, we don't have the answers yet, but the likelihood of impact is very high.” 

On top of all this, there aren't any specific ways to keep an outbreak in check once it ignites. There are no vaccines or treatments for Oropouche fever yet. So when all the factors align to spread the disease, there isn't much people can do to target the disease, and when it reaches a new area, there aren't as many people with immunity and few health workers who know what they're dealing with. 

Fortunately, the Oropouche outbreak has died down, but a variety of infections are gaining a toehold in new places as infected people travel and as vectors move into new habitats, and the US is increasingly vulnerable. According to the CDC, the number of vector-borne disease cases per year has doubled in the US since 2001.

Last year, the US saw transmission of mosquito-borne diseases like Eastern equine encephalitis and West Nile virus. Malaria, a disease once eradicated across the country, saw the first local infections in 20 years in 2023 in Florida and Texas. Vectors like the Asian tiger mosquito are spreading further north as the climate changes and expands favorable conditions for its survival. 

With travelers moving back and forth from regions where diseases are endemic, many will unwittingly bring back dangerous souvenirs, whether a stowaway insect in their luggage or an infection in their blood. And with midges, mosquitoes, and ticks spreading to new regions, dangerous pathogens are extending their reach. 

There are ways to slow the spread of these diseases, however, and the US has managed to do so before. The US famously launched a successful campaign to eradicate malaria within its borders.

The first step is to simply acknowledge the threat. As Oropouche showed, there may be diseases lurking closer than we realized that we simply haven't bothered to look for. 

It's fairly simple to do things like dump standing water where insects can breed or spray insecticides on midge breeding grounds. But some places are getting creative, working to build up habitats for fish, bats, birds, and dragonflies that are natural predators of mosquitoes and midges to limit their spread. Limiting the destruction and development in wilderness areas can reduce the likelihood of diseases spilling over from animals into humans. 

Some regions are looking at even more drastic ways to stymie vectors. One measure that's gaining traction is deploying sterile male mosquitoes. When they mate, they produce eggs that won't hatch, thus reducing the population of the insect. Brazil recently inaugurated a factory that breeds mosquitoes to carry a bacterium known as Wolbachia that prevents the mosquitoes from reproducing easily, slowing the viruses that cause dengue, Zika, and chikungunya, a disease that can cause fever and joint pain, now established in the Americas. Hawaii is using these mosquitoes to arrest the spread of avian malaria.

Vaccines and treatments are critical tools for addressing the diseases directly. Many pathogens can be controlled with these measures, but because they more commonly spread in poorer countries, there is less investment in containing them. Many vector-borne diseases like Oropouche are considered “neglected,” and so when they do spread beyond their typical range, there isn't much available to help those who get sick. But the growing burden of these diseases demands a new generation of tools that can target multiple threats. “We are seeing so many outbreaks that we need broad vaccines,” said Fiocruz's Sousa. 

Additionally, vector-borne diseases aren't each waiting for their turns. Countries can have multiple outbreaks at the same time on top of all the other health concerns that emerge during severe weather like extreme heat or the health care disruptions in the wake of a disaster like a major storm. “We are seeing cumulative threats because we are seeing not just one vector-borne disease,” Sousa said. “In a lot of scenarios, we are also maintaining high levels of communicable diseases.”

Right now, some health departments are being proactive, keeping an eye out for sick travelers, collecting mosquitoes in the wild to see what kinds of germs they're carrying, and coordinating with researchers across the country. 

“We've been having biweekly meetings with CDC to talk about the potential for Oropouche coming into the US and spreading,” said Bethany Bolling, zoonotic virology group manager at the Texas Department of State Health Services. “We've seen in the past that Florida and Texas are some of the primary areas where these new viruses start to establish, so in Texas, we're trying to be aware of Oropouche and what the vectors are.”

For the US, Brazil's experience with Oropouche is an important lesson that could help health officials prepare and counter the disease when it inevitably arrives.

“There is a real threat to the United States,” Tilston said. “I think we have all the right settings, and I think it's just a matter of everything being in the right place at the right time. With climate change, it's just really a matter of when it's going to happen.”

What the debate over “clarification” laws reveals about America three years out from Roe.

By the time Republican Rep. Kat Cammack arrived at a Florida emergency room, she was facing an urgent medical crisis: Her pregnancy, then five weeks along, had become ectopic and now threatened her life. It was May 2024, and though Florida's new and particularly restrictive six-week abortion ban did allow abortion in cases like hers, Cammack said she spent hours convincing hospital staff to administer the standard treatment for ending nonviable pregnancies. Doctors expressed fears about losing their licenses, prompting Cammack to pull up the legislation on her phone to show them that her case fell within legal parameters. 

Now pregnant again, Cammack recently described her experience to the Wall Street Journal, accusing the political left of “fearmongering” and creating confusion among health care providers that ultimately puts patients at risk. Her view — that confusion stems from abortion rights advocates, not the laws themselves — has become a rallying point for anti-abortion leaders.

Christina Francis, the head of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, blames mainstream medical groups like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) for misleading doctors about when they can provide abortions in states with bans. 

“They've…stated that doctors couldn't intervene in those [life-threatening] situations or they would face prosecution, and in fact, they're still peddling that lie,” she told Vox. “They [just] put out posts on the anniversary of Dobbs saying the same thing, and they have a ‘Blame the Bans' campaign where they're actively lying to practicing physicians and telling them that they have to wait until their patient is actively dying.”

But doctors argue they're scared for good reason. The laws create genuine legal risk in complex medical situations, particularly when state officials contradict the courts' interpretations of medical exceptions. That uncertainty played out dramatically in late 2023 in the case of Kate Cox, a Texas woman whose pregnancy developed fatal fetal abnormalities; a judge ruled the law's exception permitted her abortion, but the state's attorney general threatened to prosecute any doctor who performed the procedure. (Cox ultimately crossed state lines to end her pregnancy.) Other high-profile cases of doctors hesitating to provide emergency care have surfaced in the media, adding significant pressure on anti-abortion lawmakers who insist there's no legislative ambiguity to be found.

Partly in response, red state lawmakers have been moving to address — or at least signal they're addressing — gray areas in their laws, passing “clarifications” to give doctors more concrete guidance on when they can provide emergency abortions and how criminal penalties would kick in. The Guttmacher Institute found that this is one of the top legislative trends for reproductive health care this year, with 42 bills introduced across 12 states. Three of those bills — in Texas, Kentucky, and Tennessee — were signed into law, and Texas's took effect earlier this month. 

Most Americans — across parties, genders, and regions — favor allowing abortion when the pregnancy endangers the mother's life or results from rape or incest, and strong majorities also back exceptions for severe fetal anomalies or serious health problems. All state abortion bans currently include exceptions to “prevent the death” or “preserve the life” of the pregnant patient, and many also include some sort of health exception, typically to prevent “permanent” damage to a “major” bodily function. The new clarification bills could help prevent the death of some patients but do little to expand access to some of the abortion exceptions voters support. 

The new bills proposing amendments to abortion bans are fueling debates over whether incremental improvements are worth the risk of creating false confidence that major legal obstacles have been resolved. This year's fight in Kentucky clearly captured that disagreement. 

The state's local ACOG chapter helped craft the legislative language and supported the proposed clarification bill, calling it an “acceptable short-term solution.” However, the national ACOG organization, along with Planned Parenthood and some OB-GYNs with Kentucky Physicians for Reproductive Freedom, successfully urged Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, to veto it. “Although supporters of House Bill 90 claim it protects pregnant women and clarifies abortion law in Kentucky, it actually does the opposite,” Beshear declared. (The legislature overrode the governor's veto two days later.) 

As confusion mounts, supporters of abortion restrictions have doubled down on the argument that this is really not a big deal. Francis, the head of the anti-abortion OB-GYN group, argues that the bans are clear and don't need to be rewritten — doctors simply need better education. “So many of these state laws have been in place for either three years or close to three years, and there's not been a single doctor prosecuted for intervening when a woman's life would be in danger,” she said. 

But Francis also acknowledged that physicians were left without reliable guidance from hospitals, state agencies, and professional associations, institutions with attorneys who are themselves uncertain. A Washington Post investigation from late 2023 found that hospital lawyers and compliance teams often hesitated to advise doctors definitively, leaving physicians unsure when and how they could legally act.

Some anti-abortion leaders have gone so far as to allege that physicians are deliberately withholding abortion care to make a political point. Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti of Tennessee argued it wasn't his state's ban that was harming women, but “other factors like doctors' independent choices not to provide permissible abortions.”

Still, even as conservatives double down on their accusations of fearmongering, Republican-led states have been quietly adjusting their laws to ease doctors' fears of being prosecuted for providing emergency care. 

Utah lawmakers rewrote their emergency exception so doctors do not need to wait for an “immediate” threat to a patient to provide an abortion. Some states, like Idaho, have moved to scrap their “affirmative defense” provisions — meaning doctors would no longer have to be charged with a crime first and then prove in court that the abortion was medically necessary. Tennessee moved this year to provide specific examples of what constitutes a permissible exception, including PPROM (the rupture of fetal membranes before 24 weeks of gestation), severe preeclampsia (a high blood pressure disorder), and other infections risking uterine rupture. 

Texas's changes to its abortion law took effect on June 20. Its legislation, like Utah's, clarifies that doctors can perform abortions when a pregnant patient faces a life-threatening condition caused or worsened by pregnancy without waiting for that risk to become “imminent.” The law also standardizes the definition of “medical emergency” across various state statutes, and it requires training for doctors and lawyers to learn more about these exceptions.

“We all thought it is important that the law be crystal clear,” state Sen. Bryan Hughes, who introduced Texas's clarification bill this year, said in the legislature. Last fall he defended his state's abortion ban, which he also authored, as “plenty clear” and blamed news organizations for muddying the waters.

The new Texas bill was backed by the Texas Medical Association, the Texas Hospital Association, and leading anti-abortion groups like the Texas Right to Life. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, one of the largest national anti-abortion lobbying groups, praised the passage of Texas's law, stating it will “end the confusion caused by the abortion lobby through direct education to doctors.” 

Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America also championed a South Dakota law passed last year that required the state to produce a video on how doctors can legally perform abortions to save the life of a pregnant woman. In the state's subsequent six-minute video, the South Dakota Department of Health secretary says a patient does not need to be “critically ill or actively dying” for a doctor to end a pregnancy. (Abortion rights supporters have blasted the video, which they say provides no real guidelines or legal clarity to practicing physicians.)

Some legal advocates for abortion rights warn the reforms will fail to resolve the underlying confusion.

The bills are “not to clarify anything. This is just so politicians can say they fixed it,” Molly Duane, a senior attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told Vox. “The reason I know this is because the anti-abortion lobby has been pretty open about the fact that they were the ones drafting the bills. For a lawyer like me that spends all day, every day, looking at these, it's quite obvious that there's no additional language here that addresses the questions the doctors actually have.”

ACOG also opposed Texas's bill, and the group's general counsel Molly Meegan wrote last month that “the solution to a bad law is not to further legislate that law. It is to get rid of the law.”

One of the hard realities abortion rights advocates face is that in order to secure more legal protection for physicians working under vague abortion bans, they often must accept language crafted by anti-abortion lobbyists that could make things worse in the future. That controversial language can limit what types of procedures get classified as abortion or can introduce ideological terms like “maternal-fetal separation,” which are not standard in mainstream medical practice and can help justify or require medical alternatives to abortion, like cesarean deliveries and inductions of labor, that carry greater risk for patients.

While such semantic distinctions may offer doctors some short-term legal protection, activists warn they risk reinforcing a false moral hierarchy between “good” and “bad” abortions and stigmatize some forms of care rather than helping the public understand that all these procedures fall under the same broader category of abortion. 

Some of the bills also codify new “fetal personhood” language, which is part of an effort to extend constitutional protections to embryos. Abortion advocates warn this sort of language could help anti-abortion lawmakers strip patients and doctors of additional rights down the line. Beshear echoed these concerns in his veto announcement, blasting the clarification bill for using “new definitions that have been advanced by advocates who oppose in vitro fertilization and birth control.” He warned that using such language sets “a stage for future legislation and litigation” that put health care options at risk. Many physicians say they do not feel reassured by these clarifications. If anything, they feel more confused and nervous. 

The push for clearer laws reveals a fundamental tension: Abortion rights advocates say exceptions like “ectopic pregnancy” with no further detail are too vague, yet also argue that the practices of medicine are too complex to codify in law. Republican lawmakers point to legislative language granting deference to physicians' “reasonable medical judgment,” but advocates say that standard is still too open-ended. More precise language might help in typical cases but risks excluding the edge cases where doctors need protection most.

Given these trade-offs, abortion rights supporters are left grappling with a basic strategic question: whether imperfect progress is worth the potential costs.

“I think that's the age-old question,” said Kimya Forouzan, a state policy researcher at the Guttmacher Institute, which has been tracking legislative trends. “If one person could get help getting an abortion that's great but at the same time these [clarification] bills are not causing the problem that abortion bans create to go away.”

Sarah Osmundson, a maternal-fetal medicine physician in Tennessee, captured the challenge of working with patients facing high-risk pregnancies in a state with a strict abortion ban. Writing in the New York Times in 2023, she explained why she supported modest changes to her state's abortion ban, even as she understood the arguments of fellow abortion rights supporters that such imperfect amendments come with risks. “I worry that reproductive rights advocates may be digging into untenable positions and failing to listen to those affected most by the current reality,” she wrote. “Do we support incremental changes that provide minimum safety for pregnant women and physicians?”

Ultimately, lawmakers drafting clarification bills have been careful to not expand access to care in any significant way. Many still exclude abortions for rape and incest — despite polling showing that majorities of Americans want those carve-outs — and almost no state allows abortion for mental health reasons, despite mental health conditions accounting for over 20 percent of pregnancy-related deaths in the US. Many European countries permit mental health as an acceptable health exception to abortion bans.

Looking ahead, Americans should expect to see more incremental legislative tweaks coupled with state-mandated training, as anti-abortion leaders hail the passage of such medical education, or “med ed,” laws. Whether this strategy proves durable may depend on how much evidence accumulates that the core problems — criminal penalties, prosecutorial discretion, hospital risk management — run deeper than confusion about legal language. 

The med ed campaigns represent an acknowledgment that something needed fixing. The remaining question is this: What happens when the fixes don't fix it?

President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” is the centerpiece of his legislative agenda, and the stakes are high.

The bill has four major pillars: renewing his 2017 tax cuts, implementing new tax cuts, spending billions on a border wall, US Customs and Border Protection, and the military, and increasing the debt ceiling. The bill itself is a smorgasbord of policy and could also affect clean energy programs, student loans, and food assistance, but perhaps the most consequential changes will be to Medicaid.

The bill was approved by the House in May and passed a key Senate vote on Saturday. Republicans are divided over competing priorities; some want to extend Trump's tax cuts and boost immigration and defense spending, while others worry about the $2.6 trillion cost and cuts to Medicaid. Republican lawmakers aim to pass the bill by Friday using budget reconciliation, but it's unclear if all 53 Republican senators will agree.

This is a developing story. Follow along here for the latest news, explainers, and analysis.

Andrew Prokop

Republicans are barreling ahead to try to pass President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” — legislation that somehow manages to combine massive fiscal irresponsibility with devastating spending cuts.

The bill would keep the “Trump tax cuts” originally passed in 2017 in place, while adding some new tax breaks and new spending on immigration enforcement and the military.

Nicole Narea

Three years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Republicans in Congress are poised to further erode access to abortion and reproductive care.

President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” would not only directly threaten reproductive care by defunding Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers, it would also incentivize insurers for Affordable Care Act plans in some states to drop abortion coverage or make it significantly more expensive.

Eric Levitz

The Republican Party's saving grace is supposed to be its commitment to economic growth and consumer abundance. 

Sure, the GOP may see unemployed cancer patients as shiftless mooches — and the Lorax as literature's greatest villain — but for precisely those reasons, Republicans are allegedly able stewards of industrial development: Unconstrained by concerns about inequality, the environment, or social justice, the GOP will unleash the private sector's productive potential. Republicans won't balance Americans' hunger for cheap gasoline against their enlightened interest in cleaner air or a cooler planet — they'll get you the cheap fuel now. And they won't weigh America's stake in technological supremacy against the risks of unregulated innovation — they'll give cutting-edge companies whatever they need to achieve global dominance. 

Dylan Scott

While public attention has largely been focused on the Middle East and on President Donald Trump's immigration policy, Republicans in Congress are on the verge of passing massive Medicaid cuts as part of a budget bill that could lead to millions of Americans losing their health insurance benefits and, according to one recent estimate, thousands of unnecessary deaths every year.

While the GOP's so-called “big, beautiful” bill is a smorgasbord of policy — potentially including everything from blocking AI regulation to restricting the power of the federal courts — perhaps the most consequential changes would be to Medicaid. The program, which covers low-income Americans of all ages, is now the country's single largest insurer, covering more than 70 million people. The legislation approved by House Republicans, which is now being debated and amended by the Senate, would cut Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years. The upshot is that 10.3 million fewer people would be enrolled in the program by 2034.

Sean Illing

For more than half a century, the American right has preached the virtues of free markets and low taxes and deregulation. But a new wave of conservative thinkers are now arguing that Republicans have been wrong — or at the very least misguided — about the economy. 

This new economic thinking represents a break from what we've come to expect from the American right. Its proponents argue for a new strain of economic populism, one that departs from the GOP's past allegiance to big business and focuses instead on the working class. 

Nicole Narea

The fight over President Donald Trump's so-called big, beautiful bill is turning ugly.

After passing the GOP-controlled House, the bill has moved to the Senate, where Republicans are facing a bitter divide over how to balance their competing priorities.

Abdallah Fayyad

If the “big, beautiful bill,” President Donald Trump's signature legislative priority, eventually becomes law, it would gut some social programs that many people rely on. As my colleague Dylan Scott wrote in a thorough explainer, the package, which House Republicans passed last month, could result in millions of people losing their health care because of proposed work requirements on Medicaid.

There's also another part of the bill that really stands out when it comes to how Trump's domestic policy package will hurt low-income families: its overhaul of student loan programs. From changing eligibility requirements for Pell Grants, which help low-income students pay for college, to capping how much money students can borrow to cover the cost of tuition, the legislation would put a college education further out of reach for many Americans.

Dylan Matthews

To pass a law in the United States, you need to jump through a lot of hurdles. 

A bill has to first clear a committee in the House or Senate. (In the case of Republicans' tax legislation this year, its components had to clear 11 different committees.) The House Rules Committee has to agree for it to come to the floor for a vote. It has to pass that vote. In the Senate, it has to get 60 votes to beat a potential filibuster, or else obey a set of byzantine rules allowing it to pass with a simple majority.

Welcome to The Logoff: President Donald Trump is one step closer to getting his “big, beautiful bill” after it passed the House in a close vote early this morning.

Andrew Prokop

Editor's note, May 22, 8:30 am ET: The House passed a version of Trump's bill early Thursday morning. It now goes to the Senate, where Republicans say they want more changes to the bill. This story was originally published on Monday.

President Donald Trump's second term has so far been dominated by his aggressive use of executive power — but now, he's finally trying to get something through Congress.

Li Zhou

With President Donald Trump's second administration just weeks away, congressional Republicans are gearing up to execute on a wide-ranging legislative agenda touching on everything from taxes to immigration to fossil fuels. In a Monday interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump noted that his preference for doing so was “one big, beautiful bill,” but said he'd be open to two. 

To accomplish that, Republicans intend to use a process known as budget reconciliation, which allows them to approve budget-related legislation with a simple majority in the Senate. Doing so enables them to bypass filibuster rules, which would otherwise require a bill to garner 60 votes to advance in the upper chamber. (In this case, with the Senate divided 53-47 in favor of Republicans, passing a bill through normal order would also require Democratic votes.)

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Andy Jassy says AI will eliminate some Amazon jobs — but create more in at least 2 areas","https://www.businessinsider.com/andy-jassy-ai-eliminate-jobs-create-more-robotics-2025-7","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 07:19:00 GMT","

AI isn't all doom and gloom for jobs, said Amazon's Andy Jassy.

In an interview with CNBC published on Monday, the Amazon CEO deemed AI ""the most transformative technology in our lifetime."" He said that it would change things not only for Amazon customers but also for its employees.

Jassy said that AI technologies would create jobs in at least two areas of the company.

""With every technical transformation, there will be fewer people doing some of the jobs that the technology actually starts to automate,"" he said. ""Are there going to be other jobs? We're going to hire more people in AI and more people in robotics, and there are going to be other jobs that the technology wants you to go higher that we'll hire over time too.""

Jassy said that AI agents, which do tasks like coding, research, analytics, and spreadsheet work, would also change the nature of every employee's job.

""They won't have to do as much rote work,"" he said. ""Every single person gets to start every task at a more advanced starting spot.""

On LinkedIn, Amazon has added at least 500 open roles worldwide with the keyword ""robotics"" in the job title in the past month. Roles span internships to senior applied scientist positions.

The Amazon robotics senior applied scientist job description includes tasks like ""developing machine-learning capabilities and infrastructure for robotic perception and motion"" and ""building visualization tools for analyzing and debugging robot behavior.""

Jassy's comments came in response to a question about his June 17 memo, which outlined how AI would change the company's workforce.

""It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,"" he wrote.

Some Amazon employees were not happy with Jassy's message. In internal Slack channels, some called for leadership to share in the fallout, while others saw it as a layoff warning, Business Insider reported.

""There is nothing more motivating on a Tuesday than reading that your job will be replaced by AI in a few years,"" one person wrote in Slack.

Amazon employs about 1.5 million workers, according to its website, and has cut almost 28,000 jobs since the start of 2022, per Layoffs.fyi.

From Jassy's memo and Monday's interview, it is unclear which or how many Amazon employees would be affected by AI-driven job changes.

Other tech CEOs have raised the alarm on AI-related job cuts, especially for white-collar and entry-level roles.

In April, Micha Kaufman, the CEO and founder of the freelance-job site Fiverr, wrote in an email to employees that: ""It does not matter if you are a programmer, designer, project manager, data scientist, lawyer, customer support rep, salesperson, or a finance person — AI is coming for you.""

In late May, Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, suggested AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs.

""We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming,"" Amodei told Axios in an interview. ""I don't think this is on people's radar.""

Microsoft said its medical AI system diagnosed cases more accurately than human doctors by a wide margin.

In a blog post published on Monday, the tech giant said its AI system, the Microsoft AI Diagnostic Orchestrator, diagnosed cases four times as accurately as a group of experienced physicians in a test.

Microsoft's study comes as AI tools rapidly make their way into hospitals and clinics, raising questions about how much of medicine can or should be automated and what role doctors will play as diagnostic AI systems get more capable.

The experiment involved 304 case studies sourced from the New England Journal of Medicine. Both the AI and physicians had to solve these cases step by step, just like they would in a real clinic: ordering tests, asking questions, and narrowing down possibilities.

The AI system was paired with large language models from tech companies like OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic, and Google. When coupled with OpenAI's o3, the AI diagnostic system correctly solved 85.5% of the cases, Microsoft said.

By contrast, 21 practicing physicians from the US and UK — each with five to 20 years of experience — averaged 20% accuracy across the completed cases, the company added. In the study, the doctors did not have access to resources they might typically tap for diagnostics, including coworkers, books, and AI.

The AI system also solved cases ""more cost-effectively"" than its human counterparts, Microsoft said.

""Our findings also suggest that AI reduce unnecessary healthcare costs. US health spending is nearing 20% of US GDP, with up to 25% of that estimated to be wasted,"" it added.

""We're taking a big step towards medical superintelligence,"" said Mustafa Suleyman, the CEO of Microsoft's AI division, in a post on X.

He added that the cases used in the study are ""some of the toughest and most diagnostically complex"" a physician can face.

Suleyman previously led AI efforts at Google.

Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Microsoft said in the blog post that AI ""represents a complement to doctors and other health professionals.""

""While this technology is advancing rapidly, their clinical roles are much broader than simply making a diagnosis. They need to navigate ambiguity and build trust with patients and their families in a way that AI isn't set up to do,"" Microsoft said.

""Clinical roles will, we believe, evolve with AI,"" it added.

Tech leaders like Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates have said that AI could help solve the long-standing shortage of doctors.

""AI will come in and provide medical IQ, and there won't be a shortage,"" he said on an episode of the ""People by WTF"" podcast published in April.

But doctors have told BI that AI can't and shouldn't replace clinicians just yet.

AI can't replicate physicians' presence, empathy, and nuanced judgment in uncertain or complex conditions, said Dr. Shravan Verma, the CEO of a Singapore-based health tech startup.

Chatbots and AI tools can handle the first mile of care, but they must escalate to qualified professionals when needed, he told BI last month.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Trump just threatened to turn DOGE on Elon Musk as their fight over the 'big, beautiful bill' escalates. Here's the latest.","https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-is-ripping-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-again-2025-7","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 15:39:00 GMT","

Elon Musk and Donald Trump are not done fighting over the president's ""Big Beautiful Bill.""

Musk started criticizing Trump's spending bill on June 5 but walked back the attacks just days later. Musk said in an X post on June 11 that some of his remarks on Trump had gone ""too far.""

But the argument is heating up again, with Trump suggesting the cost-cutting DOGE, which Musk previously led, would now be turned to focus on his companies.

Tesla stock fell almost 6% in early-hours trading Tuesday as the fight continued.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note that the feud was ""a soap opera that remains an overhang on Tesla's stock"" as investors fear Trump taking a more hawkish line on Musk's companies.

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO reignited his attacks on the bill over the weekend, and Trump hit back with his own post on Truth Social.

On Saturday, Musk wrote on X that the president's signature tax bill ""will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country.""

""Utterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,"" he continued.

GOP lawmakers hope to send the bill, which is pending a vote in the Senate, to Trump's desk by Friday. Musk, however, said he would defeat politicians who voted for the bill if it passed and form his own political party.

""It is obvious with the insane spending of this bill, which increases the debt ceiling by a record FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS that we live in a one-party country — the PORKY PIG PARTY!!"" Musk wrote in an X post on Monday.

""Time for a new political party that actually cares about the people,"" he said.

Musk said in a follow-up post, published just an hour later, that any politician who voted for the bill after campaigning on cutting government spending should ""hang their head in shame.""

""And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth,"" he added.

Musk said later that a new party, the ""America Party,"" would be formed the day after the ""insane spending bill passes.""

""Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a VOICE,"" Musk added.

Trump responded early Tuesday morning with a Truth Social post.

He said Musk knew Trump was ""strongly against"" the EV mandate, the Biden-era incentives to buy EVs that the president's bill threatens to roll back.

""Elon Musk knew, long before he so strongly Endorsed me for President, that I was strongly against the EV Mandate,"" he said.

Trump then suggested getting DOGE to take a ""good, hard, look"" at Musk's companies.

""Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE,"" he said.

Less than an hour later, Musk wrote a series of X posts, doubling down on his opposition to the spending bill.

""Hitting the debt ceiling is the only thing that will actually force the government to cut waste and fraud,"" Musk wrote. ""That's why the debt ceiling legislation exists!""

In another post minutes later, Musk added: ""All I'm asking is that we don't bankrupt America.""

He followed up with a question to lawmakers: ""What's the point of a debt ceiling if we keep raising it?""

At the White House on Tuesday morning, Trump told reporters Musk was ""upset"" at losing the EV mandate, adding, ""he could lose a lot more than that, I can tell you right now.""

A reporter asked Trump if he would deport Musk. Trump replied, ""I don't know. We'll have to take a look. We might have to put DOGE on Elon. You know what DOGE is? The monster that might have to go back and eat Elon. Wouldn't that be terrible? He gets a lot of subsidies.""

Musk then said on X, ""So tempting to escalate this. So, so tempting. But I will refrain for now.""

After arriving in Florida, Trump told reporters, ""DOGE is going to look at Musk. If DOGE looks at Musk, we're going to save a fortune. 

""I don't think he should be playing that game with me,"" he added.

Musk and the White House did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

The move comes amid growing concerns from content creators and publishers that AI giants are exploiting their work without consent or compensation.

Historically, search engines have indexed content in a way that drives traffic and ad revenue back to original sources. But AI bot crawlers, used for training large language models, harvest vast amounts of data and send much less traffic back to the original creators of this content. These bots are used by industry giants including Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic.

Cloudflare, which manages and protects traffic for about 20% of the web, initially rolled out an optional one-click AI crawler blocking system in 2024. More than a million customers enabled it. Now, this becomes the default: AI companies will now be required to obtain explicit permission from websites before scraping, flipping the script on passive data harvesting.

""Original content is what makes the internet one of the greatest inventions in the last century, and we have to come together to protect it,"" Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said.

""AI crawlers have been scraping content without limits,"" he added. ""Our goal is to put the power back in the hands of creators, while still helping AI companies innovate. This is about safeguarding the future of a free and vibrant internet with a new model that works for everyone.""

As part of its broader push toward a permission-based internet, Cloudflare also rolled out Pay Per Crawl on Tuesday. This new feature lets select publishers and creators charge AI companies for accessing their content. Participants can set pricing for individual crawlers, granting full control over how and whether their work is used in AI model training.

Cloudflare hopes to create a transparent, consent-driven marketplace that helps creators decide whether to allow all AI crawlers, permit specific ones, or set their own access fees, turning previously unmonetized content usage into new revenue streams.

For AI companies, Pay Per Crawl offers a streamlined interface to browse access terms, view pricing, and choose whether to pay or walk away without the data.

Pay Per Crawl is currently available to a select group of partners, with broader access available through this sign-up page.

Major publishers have signed on or expressed support for Cloudflare's latest move to block AI bot crawlers by default, including Gannett, Time, BuzzFeed, The Atlantic, and the Associated Press. Other companies, such as Stack Overflow, have endorsed the initiative.

At its core, Cloudflare's moves are an attempt to reset the internet's economic model for the new age of generative AI. This initiative doesn't halt AI innovation, but encourages it to grow responsibly by paying for intellectual property and rewarding the creators behind the data.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Generative AI is making running an online business a nightmare","https://www.businessinsider.com/america-small-business-owners-swamped-by-scammers-generative-ai-2025-7","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 08:09:00 GMT","

Sometime last year, Ian Lamont's inbox began piling up with inquiries about a job listing. The Boston-based owner of a how-to guide company hadn't opened any new positions, but when he logged onto LinkedIn, he found one for a ""Data Entry Clerk"" linked to his business's name and logo.

Lamont soon realized his brand was being scammed, which he confirmed when he came across the profile of someone purporting to be his company's ""manager."" The account had fewer than a dozen connections and an AI-generated face. He spent the next few days warning visitors to his company's site about the scam and convincing LinkedIn to take down the fake profile and listing. By then, more than twenty people reached out to him directly about the job, and he suspects many more had applied.

Generative AI's potential to bolster business is staggering. According to one 2023 estimate from McKinsey, in the coming years it's expected to add more value to the global economy annually than the entire GDP of the United Kingdom. At the same time, GenAI's ability to almost instantaneously produce authentic-seeming content at mass scale has created the equally staggering potential to harm businesses.

Since ChatGPT's debut in 2022, online businesses have had to navigate a rapidly expanding deepfake economy, where it's increasingly difficult to discern whether any text, call, or email is real or a scam. In the past year alone, GenAI-enabled scams have quadrupled, according to the scam reporting platform Chainabuse. In a Nationwide insurance survey of small business owners last fall, a quarter reported having faced at least one AI scam in the past year. Microsoft says it now shuts down nearly 1.6 million bot-based signup attempts every hour. Renée DiResta, who researches online adversarial abuse at Georgetown University, tells me she calls the GenAI boom the ""industrial revolution for scams"" — as it automates frauds, lowers barriers to entry, reduces costs, and increases access to targets.

The consequences of falling for an AI-manipulated scam can be devastating. Last year, a finance clerk at the engineering firm Arup joined a video call with whom he believed were his colleagues. It turned out that each of the attendees was a deepfake recreation of a real coworker, including the organization's chief financial officer. The fraudsters asked the clerk to approve overseas transfers amounting to more than $25 million, and assuming the request came through the CFO, he green-lit the transaction.

Business Insider spoke with professionals in several industries — including recruitment, graphic design, publishing, and healthcare — who are scrambling to keep themselves and their customers safe against AI's ever-evolving threats. Many feel like they're playing an endless game of whack-a-mole, and the moles are only multiplying and getting more cunning.

Last year, fraudsters used AI to build a French-language replica of the online Japanese knives store Oishya, and sent automated scam offers to the company's 10,000-plus followers on Instagram. The fake company told customers of the real company they had won a free knife and that all they had to do was pay a small shipping fee to claim it — and nearly 100 people fell for it. Kamila Hankiewicz, who has run Oishya for nine years, learned about the scam only after several victims contacted her asking how long they needed to wait for the parcel to arrive.

It was a rude awakening for Hankiewicz. She's since ramped up the company's cybersecurity and now runs campaigns to teach customers how to spot fake communications. Though many of her customers were upset about getting defrauded, Hankiewicz helped them file reports with their financial institutions for refunds. Rattling as the experience was, ""the incident actually strengthened our relationship with many customers who appreciated our proactive approach,"" she says.

Rob Duncan, the VP of strategy at the cybersecurity firm Netcraft, isn't surprised at the surge in personalized phishing attacks against small businesses like Oishya. GenAI tools now allow even a novice lone wolf with little technical know-how to clone a brand's image and write flawless, convincing scam messages within minutes, he says. With cheap tools, ""attackers can more easily spoof employees, fool customers, or impersonate partners across multiple channels,"" Duncan says.

Though mainstream AI tools like ChatGPT have precautions in place when you ask them to infringe copyright, there are now plenty of free or inexpensive online services that allow users to replicate a business's website with simple text prompts. Using a tool called Llama Press, I was able to produce a near-exact clone of Hankiewicz's store, and personalize it from a few words of instructions. (Kody Kendall, Llama Press's founder, says cloning a store like Oshiya's doesn't trigger a safety block because there can be legitimate reasons to do so, like when a business owner is trying to migrate their website to a new hosting platform. He adds that Llama Press relies on Anthropic's and OpenAI's built-in safety checks to weed out bad-faith requests.)

Text is just one front of the war businesses are fighting against malicious uses of AI. With the latest tools, it takes a solo adversary — again with no technical expertise — as little as an hour to create a convincing fake job candidate to attend a video interview.

Tatiana Becker, a tech recruiter based in New York, tells me deepfake job candidates have become an ""epidemic."" Over the past couple years, she has had to frequently reject scam applicants who use deepfake avatars to cheat on interviews. At this point, she's able to discern some of their telltale signs of fakery, including a glitchy video quality and the candidate's refusal to switch up any element of their appearance during the call, such as taking off their headphones. Now, at the start of every interview she asks for the candidates' ID and poses more open-ended questions, like what they like to do in their free time, to suss out if they're a human. Ironically, she's made herself more robotic at the outset of interviews to sniff out the robots.

Nicole Yelland, a PR executive, says she found herself on the opposite end of deepfakery earlier this year. A scammer impersonating a startup recruiter approached her over email saying he was looking for a head of comms, with an offer package that included generous pay and benefits. The purported person even shared with her an exhaustive slide deck, decorated with AI-generated visuals, outlining the role's responsibilities and benefits. Enticed, she scheduled an interview.

During the video meeting, however, the ""hiring manager"" refused to speak, and instead asked Yelland to type her responses to the written questions in the Microsoft Teams chat section. Her alarm bells really went off once the interviewer started asking her to share a series of private documents, including her driver's license.

Yelland now runs a background check with tools like Spokeo before engaging with any stranger online. ""It's annoying and takes more time, but engaging with a spammer is more annoying and time-consuming; so this is where we are,"" she says.

While videoconferencing platforms like Teams and Zoom are getting better at detecting AI-generated accounts, some experts say the detection itself risks creating an vicious cycle. The data these platforms collect on what's fake is ultimately used to train more sophisticated GenAI models, which will help them get better at escaping fakery detectors and fuel ""an arms race defenders cannot win,"" says Jasson Casey, the CEO of Beyond Identity, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in identity theft. Casey and his company believe the focus should instead be on authenticating a person's identity. Beyond Identity sells tools that can be plugged into Zoom that verify meeting participants through their device's biometrics and location data. If it detects a discrepancy, the tools label the participants' video feed as ""unverified."" Tramèr Florian, a computer science professor at ETH Zurich, agrees that authenticating identity will likely become more essential to ensure that you're always talking to a legitimate colleague.

It's not just fake job candidates entrepreneurs now have to contend with, it's always fake versions of themselves. In late 2024, scammers ran ads on Facebook for a video featuring Jonathan Shaw, the deputy director of the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne. Although the person in it looked and sounded exactly like Dr. Shaw, the voice had been deepfaked and edited to say that metformin — a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes — is ""dangerous,"" and patients should instead switch to an unproven dietary supplement. The fake ad was accompanied by a fake written news interview with Shaw.

Several of his clinic's patients, believing the video was genuine, reached out asking how to get a hold of the supplement. ""One of my longstanding patients asked me how come I continued to prescribe metformin to him, when 'I' had said on the video that it was a poor drug,"" Shaw tells me. Eventually he was able to get Facebook to take down the video.

Then there's the equally vexing and annoying issue of AI slop — an inundation of low-quality, mass-produced images and text that is flooding the internet and making it ever-more difficult for the average person to tell what's real or fake. In her research, DiResta found instances where social platforms' recommendation engines have promoted malicious slop — where scammers would put up images of items like nonexistent rental properties, appliances, and more that users were frequently falling for it and giving away their payment details.

On Pinterest, AI-generated ""inspo"" posts have plagued people's mood boards — so much so that Philadelphia-based Cake Life Shop now often receives orders from customers asking them to recreate what are actually AI-generated cakes. In one shared with Business Insider, the cake resembles a moss-filled rainforest, and features a functional waterfall. Thankfully for cofounder Nima Etemadi, most customers are ""receptive to hearing about what is possible with real cake after we burst their AI bubble,"" he says.

Similarly, AI-generated books have swarmed Amazon and are now hurting publisher sales.

Pauline Frommer, the president of the travel guide publisher Frommer Media, says that AI-generated guidebooks have managed to reach the top of lists with the help of fake reviews. An AI publisher buys a few Prime memberships, sets the guidebook's ebook price to zero, and then leaves seemingly ""verified reviews"" by downloading its copies for free. These practices, she says, ""will make it virtually impossible for a new, legitimate brand of guidebook to enter the business right now."" Ian Lamont says he received an AI-generated guidebook as a gift last year: a text-only guide to Taiwan, with no pictures or maps.

While the FTC now considers it illegal to publish fake, AI-generated product reviews, official policies haven't yet caught up with AI-generated content itself. Platforms like Pinterest and Google have started to watermark and label AI-generated posts, but since it's not error-free yet, some worry these measures may do more harm than good. DiResta fears that a potential unintended consequence of ubiquitous AI labels would be people experiencing ""label fatigue,"" where they blindly assume that unlabeled content is therefore always ""real."" ""It's a potentially dangerous assumption if a sophisticated manipulator, like a state actor's intelligence service, manages to get disinformation content past a labeler,"" she says.

For now, small business owners should stay vigilant, says Robin Pugh, the executive director of Intelligence for Good, a non-profit that helps victims of internet-enabled crimes. They should always validate they're dealing with an actual human and that the money they're sending is actually going where they intend it to go.

Etemadi of Cake Life Shop recognizes that for as much as GenAI can help his business become more efficient, scam artists will ultimately use the same tools to become just as efficient. ""Doing business online gets more necessary and high risk every year,"" he says. ""AI is just part of that.""

Donald Trump's $3.3 trillion tax and spending cut bill passed the Senate Tuesday after a furious push by Republican leaders to persuade holdouts to back the legislation and hand the president a political win.

Senators voted 51-50 to pass the bill, with three Republicans — Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky, defying Trump to oppose the legislation. Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote. The package, which now goes to the House, combines $4.5 trillion in tax cuts with $1.2 trillion in spending cuts.

Japan's efforts to maintain a steady, friendly approach to trade negotiations are being tested as President Donald Trump ramps up pressure for a deal ahead of a looming tariff deadline. 

With higher US tariffs set to take effect on July 9, Tokyo's cautious strategy has yet to deliver a breakthrough, raising the risk that it could become an easy target in the Trump administration's push for fast wins. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

The Senate on Tuesday passed President Donald Trump's megabill after days of negotiations and a marathon amendment session that at times appeared to imperil the domestic policy package.

The final vote was 51-50, with Vice President JD Vance casting a final, tie-breaking vote. Republican Sens. Thom Tillis, N.C., Rand Paul, Ky., and Susan Collins, Me., all broke with their party and voted against the massive spending bill.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune's victory in the upper chamber may be short-lived, however, as the megabill now goes to the House, where it faces an uncertain future amid firm GOP hold-outs.

The House, which just squeaked out its version of the bill, must accept the Senate's substantial changes to the package, a daunting task especially as some GOP lawmakers have expressed continued concerns over the bill's impact on the deficit.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects the bill will add at least $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.

Some House Republicans reluctantly voted for the package in May, and now, with the Senate changes, which include deeper Medicaid cuts, lawmakers are expressing continued resistance.

With his narrow majority, House Speaker Mike Johnson can only afford to lose three votes in his chamber to pass the legislation in a party-line vote.

Still, Republican senators are hailing the vote passage in their chamber as a victory, following a weekend session of work and a record-breaking vote-a-rama, which lasted 24 hours.

Senators have voted on dozens of amendments to the bill in a marathon sessions. 

Behind the scenes, GOP leaders have been negotiating with hold-outs in their conference who, for days,  threatened to sink Trump's bill.

Ultimately, none of the amendments fundamentally changed the bill, but Democrats seized on the process to force their GOP colleagues to go on the record on some politically tenuous positions.

As the bill heads back to the House, lawmakers are rushing to try to get the package to Trump's desk before a self-imposed July 4 deadline.

The package, which seeks to codify Trump's sweeping domestic policy agenda, faces a tenuous path in the lower chamber.

Hard-line conservative House members, such as Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, have voiced frustration over what they view as the Senate using the July 4 deadline to force a vote in the lower chamber, despite persistent opposition. 

""Rumor is Senate plans to jam the House with its weaker, unacceptable OBBB before 7/4,"" Roy wrote on X last week, referring to Trump's ""one big, beautiful bill,"" which was renamed right before the vote.

""This is not a surprise but it would be a mistake,"" Roy said, adding that he ""would not vote for it as it is.""

The Senate passage comes as Trump last week ramped up his pressure campaign on lawmakers to pass the bill before July 4, increasing the stakes of the self-imposed deadline 

""To my friends in the Senate, lock yourself in a room if you must, don't go home, and GET THE DEAL DONE THIS WEEK,"" he wrote on Truth Social.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank would have eased monetary policy by now if not for President Donald Trump's tariff plan.

When asked during a panel if the Fed would have lowered rates again this year had Trump not announced his controversial plan to impose higher levies on imported goods earlier this year, Powell said, ""I think that's right.""

""In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,"" Powell said at European Central Bank forum in Sintra, Portugal.

Powell's admission comes as the Fed has entered a holding pattern on interest rates despite mounting pressure from the White House.

The Fed last month held the key borrowing rate steady once again, keeping fed funds at the same range between 4.25% and 4.5% where it's been since December.

The central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee indicated via its so-called dot plot of members' projections that there could be two cuts by the end of 2025. However, Powell also said at a press conference last month that the Fed was ""well positioned"" to remain in a wait-and-see mode.

On Tuesday, Powell was asked if July would be too soon for markets to expect a rate cut. He answered that that he ""really can't say"" and that ""it's going to depend on the data."" Fed funds futures traders are pricing in a more than 76% likelihood that the central bank once again holds rates steady at the July policy gathering, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

""We are going meeting by meeting,"" Powell said during Tuesday's panel. ""I wouldn't take any meeting off the table or put it directly on the table. It's going to depend on how the data evolve.""

The Fed's unrelenting position to keep rates where they are for now has caught the ire of Trump and his administration, who have publicly admonished Powell for the central bank's failure to lower borrowing costs. Trump last week called Powell ""terrible"" and said he was a ""very average mentally person.""

When asked on Tuesday if he would stay on as Fed governor after his term as chair ends next year, Powell responded, ""I have nothing for you on that today."" Powell's term as a Fed chair ends in 2026, while his position as governor is set to run into 2028. 

Global trade policy and Trump's attacks on Powell took center stage at Tuesday's event, where the U.S. Fed chief was flanked on the panel by other leaders of central banks from around the globe. International central bank leaders fielded questions ranging from whether they'd act as Powell if they were in his shoes, to whether nations are breaking away from the U.S.

Trump's on again, off again tariff policy has put global markets and monetary policy makers on edge. The president first unveiled a plan for steep levies on imported goods in early April, before delaying many of the steepest tariffs shortly after when U.S. markets tumbled.

The U.S. stock market has more than regained losses recorded in the wake of Trump's initial announcement, with the S&P 500 hitting all-time highs in recent days for the first time since February. But investors and monetary policymakers still report feeling uncertain about the future of global trade and its impact on global economic growth, profits and stock markets. 

""All I want — and all anybody at the Fed wants — is to deliver an economy that has price stability, maximum employment, financial stability,"" Powell said. ""What keeps me awake at night is: How do we get that done? I want to hand over to my successor an economy in good shape.""

Televangelist Jimmy Swaggart, whose multimillion-dollar ministry and huge audience dwindled following his prostitution scandals, has died. He was 90.

Swaggart death was announced Tuesday on his public Facebook page. A cause wasn't immediately given, though Swaggart had been in ill health.

The Louisiana native was best known for being a captivating Pentecostal preacher with a massive following before being caught on camera with a prostitute in New Orleans in 1988, one of a string of successful TV preachers brought down in the 1980s and '90s by sex scandals. He continued preaching for decades, but with a reduced audience.

Swaggart encapsulated his downfall in a tearful 1988 sermon, in which he wept and apologized but made no reference to his connection to a prostitute.

""I have sinned against you,"" Swaggart told parishioners nationwide. ""I beg you to forgive me.""

He announced his resignation from the Assemblies of God later that year, shortly after the church said it was defrocking him for rejecting punishment it had ordered for ""moral failure."" The church had wanted him to undergo a two-year rehabilitation program, including not preaching for a full year.

Swaggart said at the time that he knew dismissal was inevitable but insisted he had no choice but to separate from the church to save his ministry and Bible college.

From poverty and oil fields to a household name

Swaggart grew up poor, the son of a preacher, in a music-rich family. He excelled at piano and gospel music, playing and singing with talented cousins who took different paths: rock-'n'-roller Jerry Lee Lewis and country singer Mickey Gilley.

In his hometown of Ferriday, Louisiana, Swaggart said he first heard the call of God at age 8. The voice gave him goose bumps and made his hair tingle, he said.

""Everything seemed different after that day in front of the Arcade Theater,"" he said in a 1985 interview with the Jacksonville Journal-Courier in Illinois. ""I felt better inside. Almost like taking a bath.""

He preached and worked part time in oil fields until he was 23. He then moved entirely into his ministry: preaching, playing piano and singing gospel songs with the barrelhouse fervor of cousin Lewis at Assemblies of God revivals and camp meetings.

Swaggart started a radio show, a magazine, and then moved into television, with outspoken views.

He called Roman Catholicism ""a false religion. It is not the Christian way,"" and claimed that Jews suffered for thousands of years ""because of their rejection of Christ.""

""If you don't like what I say, talk to my boss,"" he once shouted as he strode in front of his congregation at his Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, where his sermons moved listeners to speak in tongues and stand up as if possessed by the Holy Spirit.

Swaggart's messages stirred thousands of congregants and millions of TV viewers, making him a household name by the late 1980s. Contributors built Jimmy Swaggart Ministries into a business that made an estimated $142 million in 1986.

His Baton Rouge complex still includes a worship center and broadcasting and recording facilities.

The scandals that led to Swaggart's ruin

Swaggart's downfall came in the late 1980s as other prominent preachers faced similar scandals. Swaggart said publicly that his earnings were hurt in 1987 by the sex scandal surrounding rival televangelist Jim Bakker and a former church secretary at Bakker's PTL ministry organization.

The following year, Swaggart was photographed at a hotel with Debra Murphree, an admitted prostitute who told reporters that the two did not have sex but that the preacher had paid her to pose nude.

She later repeated the claim — and posed nude — for Penthouse magazine.

The surveillance photos that crippled Swaggart's career apparently stemmed from his rivalry with preacher Marvin Gorman, whom Swaggart had accused of sexual misdeeds. Gorman hired the photographer who captured Swaggart and Murphree on film. Swaggart later paid Gorman $1.8 million to settle a lawsuit over the sexual allegations against Gorman.

More trouble came in 1991, when police in California detained Swaggart with another prostitute. The evangelist was charged with driving on the wrong side of the road and driving an unregistered Jaguar. His companion, Rosemary Garcia, said Swaggart became nervous when he saw the police car and weaved when he tried to stuff pornographic magazines under a car seat.

Swaggart was later mocked by the late TV comic Phil Hartman, who impersonated him on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live.""

Out of the public eye but still in the pulpit

The evangelist largely stayed out of the news in later years but remained in the pulpit at Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, often joined by his son, Donnie, a fellow preacher. His radio station broadcast church services and gospel music to 21 states, and Swaggart's ministry boasted a worldwide audience on the internet.

The preacher caused another brief stir in 2004 with remarks about being ""looked at"" amorously by a gay man.

""And I'm going to be blunt and plain: If one ever looks at me like that, I'm going to kill him and tell God he died,"" Swaggart said, to laughter from the congregation. He later apologized.

Swaggart made few public appearances outside his church, save for singing ""Amazing Grace"" at the 2005 funeral of Louisiana Secretary of State Fox McKeithen, a prominent name in state politics for decades.

In 2022, he shared memories at the memorial service for Lewis, his cousin and rock 'n' roll pioneer. The pair had released ""The Boys From Ferriday,"" a gospel album, earlier that year.

In this article

Lululemon has filed a lawsuit against Costco that accuses the wholesale club operator of selling lower-priced duplicates of some of its popular athleisure clothing.

Lululemon Athletica claims in its lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California that Costco has ""unlawfully traded"" on its reputation, goodwill and sweat equity by selling unauthorized and unlicensed apparel that uses knockoff, infringing versions of its patents.

Lululemon alleges that Costco is known to use manufacturers of popular branded products for its private label Kirkland brand, but that the company and the manufacturers don't tell consumers of the connection between them for many of the Kirkland-branded products. Because of this, Lululemon claims this leads at least some shoppers to believe that Kirkland-branded products are made by the authentic supplier of the ""original"" products. Lululemon claims Costco doesn't try to dispel the ambiguity.

""As an innovation-led company that invests significantly in the research, development, and design of our products, we take the responsibility of protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights very seriously and pursue the appropriate legal action when necessary,"" a Lululemon company spokesperson said in a statement.

Some of the products Lululemon says Costco is making duplicates include its popular Scuba hoodies, Define jackets, and ABC pants.

Lululemon claims one of the duplicates that Costco sells is the Hi-Tec Men's Scuba Full Zip, with the lawsuit showing a screenshot image of Costco's website showing the item priced at $19.97. Lululemon sells several men's jackets that cost more than $100 each.

Costco, based in Issaquah, Washington, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

Lululemon is requesting a jury trial and wants Costco to stop selling the products that it considers to be duplicates. It is also seeking an unspecified amount in monetary damages.

Lulemon was in a similar legal dispute with Peloton in 2021. Two years later the companies announced a five-year partnership that included Lululemon becoming the primary athletic apparel partner to Peloton.

In this article

Shares of Tesla were under pressure on Tuesday after President Donald Trump said in a late-night social media post that the federal government should look into cutting subsidies for Elon Musk's companies.

""Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE. Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!"" the Truth Social post said.

""DOGE"" refers to the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk led early in Trump's administration before leaving his government role in late May

Tesla's stock was down nearly 5% on Tuesday. Some of Musk's other ventures, including SpaceX and Starlink, are heavily reliant on government policy decisions.

Trump appeared to reiterate his idea to cut the subsidies when speaking to reporters on Tuesday morning.

""He's upset that he's losing his EV mandate ... but he can lose a lot more than that, I can tell you. Elon can lose a lot more than that,"" Trump said.

Trump expanded on his comments again later Tuesday morning.

""I think what's going to happen is DOGE is going to look at Musk. And if DOGE looks at Musk, we're going to save a fortune. ... I don't think he should be playing that game with me,"" Trump told reporters.

Musk, who campaigned with Trump in 2024, has been publicly critical of the tax and spending bill making its way through Congress. The legislation appears set to cut government support for green energy and electric cars while raising the projected federal deficit, relative to current law.

On social media site X, Musk responded to a screenshot of Trump's post with ""I am literally saying CUT IT ALL. Now.""

Musk's criticism of the administration's spending plans appeared to be one reason for a public feud in early June, which led to a sell-off in Tesla's stock. Then, tensions appeared to cool, and Tesla shares had rebounded more than 11% since June 5.

However, the Tesla CEO has started his criticism of the tax bill again, and also taken aim at the Republican Party. On Monday, Musk said on X that it was ""time for a new political party that actually cares about the people.""

In this article

Internet firm Cloudflare will start blocking artificial intelligence crawlers from accessing content without website owners' permission or compensation by default, in a move that could significantly impact AI developers' ability to train their models.

Starting Tuesday, every new web domain that signs up to Cloudflare will be asked if they want to allow AI crawlers, effectively giving them the ability to prevent bots from scraping data from their websites. The company will also allow publishers to charge AI crawlers for access using a new ""pay per crawl"" model.

Cloudflare is what's called a content delivery network, or CDN. It helps businesses deliver online content and applications faster by caching the data closer to end-users. They play a significant role in making sure people can access web content seamlessly every day.

Roughly 16% of global internet traffic goes directly through Cloudflare's CDN, the firm estimated in a 2023 report.

""AI crawlers have been scraping content without limits. Our goal is to put the power back in the hands of creators, while still helping AI companies innovate,"" said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare, in a statement Tuesday.

""This is about safeguarding the future of a free and vibrant Internet with a new model that works for everyone,"" he added.

AI crawlers are automated bots designed to extract large quantities of data from websites, databases and other sources of information to train large language models from the likes of OpenAI and Google.

Whereas the internet previously rewarded creators by directing users to original websites, according to Cloudflare, today AI crawlers are breaking that model by collecting text, articles and images to generate responses to queries in a way that users don't need to visit the original source.

This, the company adds, is depriving publishers of vital traffic and, in turn, revenue from online advertising.

Tuesday's move builds on a tool Cloudflare launched in September last year that gave publishers the ability to block AI crawlers with a single click. Now, the company is going a step further by making this the default for all websites it provides services for.

OpenAI says it declined to participate when Cloudflare previewed its plan to block AI crawlers by default on the grounds that the content delivery network is adding a middleman to the system.

The Microsoft-backed AI lab stressed its role as a pioneer of using robots.txt, a set of code that prevents automated scraping of web data, and said its crawlers respect publisher preferences.

""AI crawlers are typically seen as more invasive and selective when it comes to the data they consumer. They have been accused of overwhelming websites and significantly impacting user experience,"" Matthew Holman, a partner at U.K. law firm Cripps, told CNBC.

""If effective, the development would hinder AI chatbots' ability to harvest data for training and search purposes,"" he added. ""This is likely to lead to a short term impact on AI model training and could, over the long term, affect the viability of models.""

WATCH: AI engineers are in high demand — but what is the job really like?

Half of that sum was clinched through secured notes and term loans, while a separate $5 billion was secured through strategic equity investment, the bank said Monday.

The funding gives xAI more firepower to build out infrastructure and develop its Grok AI chatbot as it looks to compete with bitter rival OpenAI, as well as with a swathe of other players including Amazon-backed Anthropic.

In May, Musk told CNBC that xAI has already installed 200,000 graphics processing units, or GPUs, at its Colossus facility in Memphis, Tennessee. Colossus is xAI's supercomputer that trains the firm's artificial intelligence. Musk at the time said that his company will continue buying chips from semiconductor giants Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices and that xAI is planning a 1 million GPU facility outside of Memphis.

Addressing the latest funds raised by the company, Morgan Stanley that ""the proceeds will support xAI's continued development of cutting-edge AI solutions, including one of the world's largest data center and its flagship Grok platform.""

XAI continues to release updates to Grok and unveiled the Grok 3 AI model in February. Musk has sought to boost the use of Grok by integrating the AI model with the X social media platform, formerly known as Twitter. In March, xAI acquired X in a deal that valued the site at $33 billion and the AI firm at $80 billion. It's unclear if the new equity raise has changed that valuation.

XAI was not immediately available for comment.

Last year, xAI raised $6 billion at a valuation of $50 billion, CNBC reported.

Morgan Stanley said the latest debt offering was ""oversubscribed and included prominent global debt investors.""

Competition among American AI startups is intensifying, with companies raising huge amounts of funding to buy chips and build infrastructure.

OpenAI in March closed a $40 billion financing round that valued the ChatGPT developer at $300 billion. Its big investors include Microsoft and Japan's SoftBank.

Anthropic, the developer of the Claude chatbot, closed a funding round in March that valued the firm at $61.5 billion. The company then received a five-year $2.5 billion revolving credit line in May.

Musk has called Grok a ""maximally truth-seeking"" AI that is also ""anti-woke,"" in a bid to set it apart from its rivals. But this has not come without its fair share of controversy. Earlier this year, Grok responded to user queries with unrelated comments about the controversial topic of ""white genocide"" and South Africa.

Musk has also clashed with fellow AI leaders, including OpenAI's Sam Altman. Most famously, Musk claimed that OpenAI, which he co-founded, has deviated from its original mission of developing AI to benefit humanity as a nonprofit and is instead focused on commercial success. In February, Musk alongside a group of investors, put in a bid of $97.4 billion to buy control of OpenAI. Altman swiftly rejected the offer.

U.S. President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" — or officially, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — is a controversial piece of legislation, but some banks are in favor of it, saying it's the shot in the arm the economy needs.

It was advanced in a narrow 51-49 vote in the U.S. Senate late Saturday, moving the large spending measure closer to the president's desk.

The bill, which is characterized by sweeping tax reforms and targeted incentives and is forecast to add to the federal deficit, has triggered warnings from credit agencies and drawn criticism.

But some banks say they think the bill could boost the U.S. economy.

In a letter published Sunday, the American Bankers Association said it ""strongly supports"" many provisions within the bill for the ""much needed tax relief"" they offer.

""I think the OBBB would almost unquestionably be good for the US economy over the next couple of years compared to passing nothing,"" said David Seif, Nomura's chief economist for developed markets, given that taxes will rise substantially next year following the expiry of many provisions under Trump's 2017 tax bill.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed in 2017, includes lower income tax rates, greater child tax credits and generous deductions for businesses. Without congressional action, many provisions under the act are set to expire by the end of 2025 — a shift analysts said could shrink household consumption and corporate investment. The short-term appeal of the big beautiful bill lies in its ability to avert a sharp fiscal contraction in 2026, they said.

""The most important thing OBBB does for the next few years is renew most of those expiring tax provisions, preventing a major and sudden fiscal contraction from occurring,"" Seif told CNBC. ""Provisions of OBBB allowing for faster business expensing of capital investments may raise investment over the next couple of years, though likely at the expense of investment in later years,"" he added.

Citi strategists, likewise, said in a note published last Wednesday that the passing of the bill will be an economic tail wind. ""In the near term, trade deals (UK, China, eventually Japan, India, Europe, etc) and the passing of the (net stimulatory) Big Beautiful Bill in July should improve growth sentiment,"" they wrote.

Citi also expects the Federal Reserve will loosen its monetary policy, bolstering growth sentiment, and said ""we do not see a bond vigilante moment during 2025/2026 as the BBB delta is largely funded by tariff revenues.""

Others, however, flagged serious drawbacks. 

The debt load is a central concern for many critics. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects the big, beautiful bill will add at least $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.

Although Morgan Stanley noted in early June that the bill's pro-growth tax provisions may benefit businesses and individuals, as well key equity sectors such as communication services, industrials and energy, it said it could raise concerns about fiscal sustainability.

Similarly, Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at Tax Foundation's Center for Federal Tax Policy, said, ""It is fiscally irresponsible, significantly increasing budget deficits and debt even when accounting for growth.""

York said many of the tax cuts are complicated and poorly designed, giving tax cuts to certain types of workers and leaving others out.

On top of that, because of the bill, which includes many narrowly tailored tax rules, the Internal Revenue Service will need to spend more time and resources updating forms, guidance and enforcement tools, adding to the administrative burden of an already stretched agency, she added.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is set to speak at a European Central Bank forum on Tuesday.

The panel, which is slated for 9:30 a.m. ET, focuses on the global economy amid policy shifts. It takes place in Sintra, Portugal.

Powell's commentary comes after the U.S. Federal Reserve once again held interest rates steady at its policy gathering last month. Despite pressure from President Donald Trump to lower borrowing costs, Powell said recently that the central bank was ""well positioned"" to wait on a rate cut.

His remarks also come ahead of closely watched jobs data due later this week.

The European Central Bank's latest period of monetary policy interventions to bring inflation in check is ""done,"" the institution's chief economist Philip Lane told CNBC on Tuesday.

""We do think the last cycle is done, bringing inflation down from the peak of 10[%], back to 2%, that element is over, but on a forward-looking basis we do need to stand ready to make sure that any deviation we see does not become embedded, does not change the medium-term picture,"" Lane said in an interview with CNBC's Annette Weisbach at the ECB's annual forum in Sintra, Portugal.

The euro zone inflation rate came in at 1.9% for May, below the central bank's 2% target. Its key interest rate has meanwhile been cut to 2% from a peak of 4% over the last year, with money market pricing currently suggesting expectations for a further quarter-point rate trim to 1.75% by the end of the year.

Asked what it meant to be ""done"" with the cycle, Lane said it meant the ECB had managed to remove the price shocks of 2021 and 2022 — which stemmed from the energy crisis and supply chain restrictions — from the system. However, he cautioned there were already ""new shocks hitting the system"" that monetary policy would need to adapt to, and that it remained possible that ""there might be some cyclical movements a bit lower.""

Rather than dealing with a price shock, the ECB is now monitoring a mix of energy market moves, exchange rates and inflation expectations to ensure it does not ""overreact"" to small deviations in inflation. It is also on the watch to not overlook any medium-term changes to the outlook or ""persistent"" factors impacting the domestic economy.

Also in Sintra, Belgian central bank chief Pierre Wunsch told CNBC that risks to inflation and growth in the euro area are now tilted to the downside.

""There is a broad consensus that we are very close to [the ECB's 2% inflation] target now, the job is mostly done,"" Wunsch said on Monday evening. Europe has seen two years of ""relatively slow growth,"" but any recovery may be delayed by global uncertainty, he also noted.

He added that ""if we have to move more it probably will be to the downside, a further cut. I'm not pleading for one, but I think if there is any discussion it's more in that direction.""

The ECB will be monitoring economic data in the coming months to see if there are any improvements in euro zone growth, particularly in production — and the central bank may need to be ""a bit more supportive"" if it doesn't, Wunsch said.

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune.

The Trump family's crypto business is increasingly becoming a bet on Bitcoin. On Monday afternoon, American Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency mining and holding company backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., announced that it had raised $220 million. The firm plans to use the new capital to acquire more of the world's largest cryptocurrency, and to buy more miners, which are computer servers that process Bitcoin transactions in exchange for crypto.

About $10 million of the private stock sale was immediately converted into Bitcoin. The announcement did not say how many or which investors bought shares of the Trump sons' company.





American Bitcoin is a subsidiary of Hut 8, a publicly traded Bitcoin miner. A representative for Hut 8 did not immediately respond to a request for comment.





In March, Hut 8 announced that it was giving “substantially all” of its Bitcoin mining equipment to American Bitcoin in exchange for 80% of the newly formed company's stock. Eric and Donald Trump Jr. are investors in American Bitcoin, but Hut 8 did not disclose whether the two sons of President Donald Trump exclusively owned the other 20%. 





In May, American Bitcoin announced that it was going public through a reverse merger with the company Gryphon Digital Mining. The company plans to trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker $ABTC as early as the third quarter, according to a press release. 




American Bitcoin is just one of a slew of Trump crypto businesses announced this past year. And it's not the only one to raise hundreds of millions to accumulate Bitcoin.





In a nod to Michael Saylor, whose company Strategy has pumped up its share prices by accumulating over $60 billion in Bitcoin, Trump's publicly traded media business announced in May that it planned to raise $2.5 billion to establish its own Bitcoin treasury. And Trump Media and Technology Group has filed to launch its own Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or ETF, which lets investors gain exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency without owning it themselves.





Trump's other crypto businesses are also raking it in. The 47th president has his own memecoin, which has a market capitalization of more than $1.7 billion. And then there's World Liberty Financial, a sprawling crypto project that includes a yet-to-be-released app for decentralized finance—a term for banking services like lending and borrowing conducted on a blockchain. 





Moreover, World Liberty Financial has its own stablecoin, or cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. Its market capitalization is now $2.2 billion.

 Bitcoin exchange reserves drop to a seven-year low, signaling a potential supply shock as institutional buying from ETFs continues. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin's percent supply on exchanges has dropped below 15% for the first time since 2018.

Depleting exchange supply and OTC balances, pointing to “supply shock” and long-term accumulation.

BTC price must remain above $100,000 to secure the upside.

Bitcoin exchange reserves have fallen below 15%, suggesting a supply shock as institutional demand from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) grows.

Bitcoin (BTC) percent supply on exchanges has dropped to near seven-year lows, falling to 14.5% for the first time since August 2018, Glassnode data shows.

Diminishing Bitcoin supply on exchanges may signal an incoming price rally fueled by a “supply shock,” which occurs when strong buyer demand meets decreasing available BTC.

Related: Bitcoin hashrate down 15%, 26 firms add BTC to balance sheets: June in charts

This trend usually signals rising investor confidence and a shift toward long-term holding. For example, BTC is typically transferred to cold storage or self-custody wallets, reducing the liquid supply available for trading. 

Whales often withdraw BTC after buying, signalling ongoing accumulation. With fewer coins available for sale, short-term sell pressure diminishes.

Over-the-counter (OTC) desks, which facilitate large, private cryptocurrency trades, are also experiencing a tightening supply. These desks typically match buyers and sellers but depend on maintaining BTC reserves for swift and reliable trade execution.

The cumulative balance of BTC held in known OTC addresses is at historic lows. CryptoQuant data shows a 21% decline in OTC address balances linked to miners since January, now down to an all-time low of 155,472 BTC. 

This figure reflects inflows from over two unique “1-hop” addresses tied to mining pools, excluding miners and centralized exchange addresses. This data aggregates inflows from over two distinct “1-hop” addresses connected to mining pools, excluding miners themselves and centralized exchange addresses.

This increasing scarcity on exchanges and OTC desks can amplify price surges as demand outstrips supply.

“The Bitcoin balance available OTC is in freefall,” Crypto Chiefs said in a recent X post, adding:

Bitcoin remained strong above the key $100,000 psychological support, a level it has held since May 28, despite seeing 2.85% losses over the last two days. 

Bitcoin's resilience above the $100,000 mark is backed by “strong institutional demand” and “shrinking,” according to Focusw3b Agency founder, Lau.

This demand is most evident in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, which have recorded 15 days of consecutive inflows. 

According to data from SoSoValue, the streak began on June 9, with inflows of over $386 million and continued through Monday, with an additional $102 million in inflows. In total, over $4.7 billion in capital moved into spot Bitcoin ETFs over the past 15 days.

Maintaining the $100,000 psychological support will be critical for securing Bitcoin's upside and avoiding significant downside volatility.

A potential Bitcoin correction below $100,000 would liquidate over $6.42 billion worth of cumulative leveraged long positions across all exchanges, CoinGlass data shows.

Numerous analysts say that Bitcoin dropping below $100,000 is becoming less likely, setting optimistic targets for the rest of 2025 ranging from $140,000 to above $200,000.

The fast rise of XRP's popularity and its place as a top 5 cryptocurrency has seen it emerge as a major competitor for Ethereum. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency in the industry and the largest altcoin, has always led the way for an altcoin season when it begins to outperform Bitcoin. However, it seems the tides may be turning as one crypto analyst has suggested that XRP could be the altcoin to lead the next altcoin season ahead of Ethereum.

According to crypto analyst Cyptoinsightuk, there are a number of developments that point at a possible altcoin season being on the horizon. The first of these is the performance of Bitcoin as it continues to rally ahead of the rest of the crypto market. So far, with the volume rising, the leading cryptocurrency has been pushing toward new all-time highs.

The next step from here is that the Bitcoin price does push upwards into areas with denser liquidity, which could trigger a renewed rally. In the charts shared, this area of dense liquidity is placed at $114,000, reaching which would mean a new all-time high for the Bitcoin price and a continued rise in the dominance before it tops. Once a top is reached on the Bitcoin dominance chart, the altcoin season is expected to start in full bloom.

Instead of Ethereum being expected to lead the start of the altcoin season, the crypto analyst points to how the XRP price has often reacted to moves like this in the past. Notably, despite the Bitcoin price leading the market into deep losses, the XRP price has refused to break below the $2 support.

The range that has plagued the altcoin began back in 2024 and has been around for six months. Previously, when the XRP price has ranged this much, it has often ended in a breakout, similar to what was seen back in October 2024.

Cryptoinsightuk explains that if Bitcoin is able to break out of this range, then it would be the catalyst for the XRP price to take off. Furthermore, the market has now plunged toward what the analyst refers to as the “Previous Alt Season Start Point”, suggesting a reset that could mean the start of the next altcoin season is around the corner.

The crypto analyst also pointed out the fact that there have been weeks of bearish divergence on the Bitcoin dominance chart. Given this, they believe the dominance will begin to fall soon and will do so quickly. In this case, the prices of altcoins like XRP are expected to rip higher, bringing in the next altcoin season. “Just to put things into context of how mental alt coins could go, the “XRP Move” box looks like just a blip, this equated to a 462% rise in $XRP price,” the analyst said.

Bitcoin and Ethereum both posted modest gains in the past week, with BTC rising 6.2% and ETH up by 9.6%. However, momentum appears to have paused at the start of the new week.

As of Monday, Bitcoin trades just above $107,000 after a slight 0.6% daily dip, while Ethereum has remained flat over the past 24 hours. Analysts have turned to blockchain data and macro signals for cues on where the market may head next.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Onchain Trend

Recent insights from CryptoQuant Quicktake platform contributor Amr Taha provide some context behind the price action. In a detailed post, Taha noted that Ethereum inflows to Binance have continued for five consecutive days, a trend that could suggest either rising sell pressure or repositioning by major players.

At the same time, data from Bitcoin's short-term holder (STH) Net Position Realized Cap shows a notable reversal, increasing from negative $49 billion to over $5 billion.

This pattern is typically associated with increased activity from retail investors, especially during periods of upward price movement. Taha noted:

Historically, spikes in (STH) occur near potential market tops, as retail investors tend to FOMO into Bitcoin rallies.

While this doesn't necessarily signal a reversal, it has often preceded short-term corrections or periods of sideways consolidation. Bitcoin's steady climb in June, despite occasional pullbacks, appears to have encouraged smaller investors to re-enter the market.

In the case of Ethereum, another CryptoQuant analyst, “crypto sunmoon,” pointed to continued accumulation by long-term holders during last month's price consolidation.

This suggests a different dynamic is at play on the Ethereum side, with more patient capital building positions amid ongoing price suppression. Long-term holder accumulation often indicates growing confidence in an asset's future, even if current market conditions appear lackluster.

US Policy and Macro Risk Add Layers to Market Outlook

Beyond market behavior, external factors may also shape crypto price action. Amr Taha highlighted recent political developments in the United States, particularly former President Donald Trump's announcement of a proposed Senate bill promising wide-reaching tax cuts.

The bill, which excludes taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security income, could lead to an increase in consumer liquidity. If passed, this could impact investor appetite across both traditional and digital markets by temporarily boosting household spending power.

However, not everybody is convinced of the bill's long-term implications. Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned that the measure, if not accompanied by spending cuts, could expand the federal deficit and lead to economic instability over time.

Large fiscal imbalances often have ripple effects on monetary policy, potentially affecting interest rates, inflation expectations, and risk sentiment, all of which can influence investor behavior in crypto markets. Taha concluded:

Geopolitical disturbances can significantly impact investor sentiment. In response, investors might reconsider their positions in asset markets, possibly moving away from riskier assets and equities toward more stable options like bonds or safe-haven currencies.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum advance cautiously in a calm market, it is Solana that steals the spotlight. In one week, its price soared by 16.5 %, eclipsing the performance of the two historic pillars. This breakthrough is no trivial matter : it fits into a context of returning to fundamentals, where investors are once again scrutinizing technical signals and the solidity of projects. Solana, long relegated to the background, now seems to reposition itself as a serious contender for leadership in the next cycle.

Solana's surge this week is explained by a well-identified fundamental element: the progress of the regulatory process towards the creation of a spot ETF backed by SOL in the United States.

This news has been the main driver of the 16.5 % rise, which pushed the crypto to $158.12. Solana is the star of the week among the top ten cryptos by market capitalization, thus taking precedence over Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of performance.

This enthusiasm comes as financial markets, eased by the Fed's rate hold and the drop in oil prices, offer a more favorable environment for risky assets.

On the technical side, several key signals strengthen this momentum, although the underlying trend remains to be confirmed :

These elements show that while the current impulse is real, it rests on a combination of favorable regulatory news and positive but still fragile technical signals.

Beyond the announcement effect linked to the crypto ETF, it is the analysis of on-chain technical data that provides the keys to interpret the next phase of the movement. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) has risen to 59, signaling a “moderate bullish momentum”, without yet being in the overbought zone, traditionally above 70.

This level suggests there is still room for growth before technical profit-taking might slow the momentum. Furthermore, the Squeeze Momentum Indicator shows an “ON” status, indicating that volatility remains compressed despite the strong price rise.

Historically, this type of compression on a weekly timeframe can precede more sustained major moves.

Moreover, the importance of trading volume during this market phase plays a decisive role. Solana surpassed $140 “on rising volume”, and the $100 to $120 zones are now identified as “high volume accumulation areas”, which strengthens the support's solidity within this range.

However, the $160 to $180 level represents a first significant barrier, regularly tested since 2024. A break above this zone, coupled with an ADX rebound above 20, would be seen by analysts as a trigger for a more structured bullish cycle.

In the short term, the market seems to grant Solana the benefit of the doubt in a context where the major cryptos are still searching for direction. If the spot ETF were to materialize and push the price to new records, it could be a major catalyst capable of firmly establishing SOL in the institutional asset landscape. However, as long as trend indicators are not validated, the scenario of a simple technical rebound within a broad consolidation range cannot be ruled out.

Although the cryptocurrency market has seen a slight decline in recent days, Bitcoin continues to dominate. This has resulted in altcoins recording their weakest performance against BTC in years.

The total market capitalization excluding Bitcoin recovered by nearly 10% last week. Sitting at a critical support level of $1 trillion, the new week has started calmly for altcoins. If this support zone holds across the altcoin market, it could indicate that the capital flowing into crypto—currently dominated by Bitcoin—may begin to shift towards altcoins. In particular, expectations around ETFs, the possibility of early Fed rate cuts, and the launch of new altcoin-based products could support this transition.

Several developments within the internal dynamics of the crypto market may also gradually shift investor sentiment in favor of altcoins. The ongoing ETF progress for Ethereum, the launch of a staking-integrated ETF for Solana, and rising institutional interest in Bitcoin Cash are just some examples of this growing momentum toward altcoins.

Ethereum, which leads the altcoin market, continues to face pressure—most recently from the SEC's decision to delay the Ethereum staking ETF proposed by Bitwise.

The SEC's approval of the spot Ethereum ETF last year was a major milestone. Now, the potential inclusion of staking could mark another turning point for ETH. The possible returns from introducing staking into ETFs, along with broader spot ETF approvals, remain powerful catalysts for Ethereum over the medium to long term.

At the same time, increased activity on the Ethereum network and recent upgrades are contributing to its stability. The expansion of institutional Ethereum products in the second half of the year could also bring ETH back into focus. In the short term, however, ETH remains under technical pressure.

Ethereum recently rebounded alongside the broader market following a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. As a result, ETH recovered the support level we've been monitoring at $2,430, driven by renewed buying interest.

Currently, ETH is trading sideways above the $2,430 support, but ongoing pressure is making it difficult to break into the $2,500 region. If ETH manages to secure daily closes above $2,500, this could open the door for a move towards $2,700. The resistance at $2,730 has remained unbroken since May. A high-volume breakout above this level could trigger a rally towards the $3,000–3,400 range.

However, if ETH—already under pressure—falls below the $2,430 support without any shock developments, we could see an increase in selling pressure. If that happens, and ETH dips below the 3-month EMA at $2,380, the likelihood of a move towards $2,000 increases significantly.

Solana's REX-Osprey SOL+Staking ETF is the first spot ETF to integrate staking rewards. Launching on July 2, 2025, this product offers investors exposure to both SOL price action and passive staking income. This first-of-its-kind ETF has been met with short-term positive sentiment.

However, this ETF development coincides with a weakening of Solana's network fundamentals. Stablecoin value on the network has declined since the start of the year, and revenues have also fallen. This suggests waning interest in Solana, which is also making it technically difficult for SOL to break out of its short-term downtrend. At this stage, sustained interest in the ETF could boost demand for SOL again. For stronger price action, we'll need to see a recovery in network usage and an increase in institutional fund flows.

Recent buying activity in Solana helped break the short-term downtrend. However, following the ETF news, the typical “sell the news” reaction in crypto kicked in, and the SOL price now appears to be retesting the trendline.

Accordingly, $148 is a key support level for SOL. If buyers can defend this level, it would confirm the continuation of the uptrend. In this case, we could see Solana advancing toward price targets of $165, $183, and $202, respectively.

Conversely, if daily closes fall below the $148 support, a pullback toward the $130 level becomes likely.

Bitcoin Cash has recently emerged as one of the market's standout assets. BCH, currently trading at $523, is revisiting levels not seen since December 2024.

After beginning its uptrend in April, BCH was only marginally affected by the May correction and managed to maintain its positive momentum through June. The recent divergence in BCH—both technically and in terms of investor interest—positions it as a notable option for short-term speculative trading. That said, the sustainability of this uptrend will depend on broader market conditions and macroeconomic developments.

Technically, the Stochastic RSI on the daily chart indicates that BCH may continue its upward move. Based on the last bearish wave (from December 2024 to April 2025), the nearest resistance lies at $544 (Fib 0.786). If BCH can close above this level on a weekly basis, it could continue its momentum toward the $620 resistance, followed by a medium-term target range of $720–840.

If BCH fails to break above $544, profit-taking may accelerate. In that case, a retreat to the $485 support (Fib 0.618) would be the likely first stop.

An analyst known for attaining the “Master Trader” rank on the crypto exchange Bybit believes that rallies are in sight for Solana (SOL).

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 321,400 followers on the social media platform X that he's now bullish on the native asset of the layer-1 protocol after moving above a diagonal resistance that has kept SOL bearish since late May.









The trader thinks that Solana and other coins operating on its network will witness rallies this week, at the very least.
“Nice downtrend break on SOL overnight, I think we're in for a good week [this] week. SOL ecosystem [coins] also starting to perk up and look real good again.
I think we're back, baby.”

At time of writing, SOL is worth $152.
One Solana coin that's on the trader's radar is the non-fungible token (NFT) project Pudgy Penguins (PENGU). According to the analyst, PENGU looks primed to surge after breaking out from a falling wedge structure, which is a bullish reversal pattern.
“Absolute monster breakout on PENGU here overnight.
Absolutely amazing chart here and will go much higher, in my opinion.
Looking like a standout leader, also never had a proper price discovery run yet, so expecting this one to be a banger.”

Based on the trader's chart, he seems to predict that PENGU will hit $0.025. At time of writing, PENGU is worth $0.014, up over 6% in the past day.
As Bluntz flips bullish on Solana and PENGU, he is also hinting that altcoins are on the verge of outperforming Bitcoin (BTC). The trader shares the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart, which tracks how much of the crypto market cap belongs to BTC.
Based on the trader's chart, he seems to suggest that BTC.D is flashing a bearish divergence on the three-day chart, suggesting that a bearish reversal is in play. A bearish BTC.D chart indicates that altcoins are gaining value faster than Bitcoin.

The fast rise of XRP's popularity and its place as a top 5 cryptocurrency has seen it emerge as a major competitor for Ethereum. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency in the industry and the largest altcoin, has always led the way for an altcoin season when it begins to outperform Bitcoin. However, it seems the tides may be turning as one crypto analyst has suggested that XRP could be the altcoin to lead the next altcoin season ahead of Ethereum.

According to crypto analyst Cyptoinsightuk, there are a number of developments that point at a possible altcoin season being on the horizon. The first of these is the performance of Bitcoin as it continues to rally ahead of the rest of the crypto market. So far, with the volume rising, the leading cryptocurrency has been pushing toward new all-time highs.

The next step from here is that the Bitcoin price does push upwards into areas with denser liquidity, which could trigger a renewed rally. In the charts shared, this area of dense liquidity is placed at $114,000, reaching which would mean a new all-time high for the Bitcoin price and a continued rise in the dominance before it tops. Once a top is reached on the Bitcoin dominance chart, the altcoin season is expected to start in full bloom.

Instead of Ethereum being expected to lead the start of the altcoin season, the crypto analyst points to how the XRP price has often reacted to moves like this in the past. Notably, despite the Bitcoin price leading the market into deep losses, the XRP price has refused to break below the $2 support.

The range that has plagued the altcoin began back in 2024 and has been around for six months. Previously, when the XRP price has ranged this much, it has often ended in a breakout, similar to what was seen back in October 2024.

Cryptoinsightuk explains that if Bitcoin is able to break out of this range, then it would be the catalyst for the XRP price to take off. Furthermore, the market has now plunged toward what the analyst refers to as the “Previous Alt Season Start Point”, suggesting a reset that could mean the start of the next altcoin season is around the corner.

The crypto analyst also pointed out the fact that there have been weeks of bearish divergence on the Bitcoin dominance chart. Given this, they believe the dominance will begin to fall soon and will do so quickly. In this case, the prices of altcoins like XRP are expected to rip higher, bringing in the next altcoin season. “Just to put things into context of how mental alt coins could go, the “XRP Move” box looks like just a blip, this equated to a 462% rise in $XRP price,” the analyst said.

 Four North Koreans posed as remote developers for US and Serbian blockchain firms, stealing almost $1 million in crypto to fund the regime's illicit programs. 

Four North Korean nationals were charged in the state of Georgia with wire fraud and money laundering after posing as remote IT workers at US and Serbian blockchain companies and stealing almost $1 million in crypto, prosecutors said Monday.

According to the US Department of Justice (DOJ), Kim Kwang Jin, Kang Tae Bok, Jong Pong Ju and Chang Nam Il posed as remote IT developers using fake and stolen identities to conceal their North Korean citizenship.

The group initially operated from the United Arab Emirates in 2019 before securing jobs at an Atlanta-based blockchain startup and a Serbian virtual token company between late 2020 and mid-2021.

Prosecutors said Kim and Jong submitted fraudulent documents, including stolen and fabricated IDs, to secure their positions, a tactic US Attorney Theodore S. Hertzberg called a “unique threat” to businesses hiring remote IT workers.

Once inside, the defendants used their privileged access to steal substantial sums. In February 2022, Jong siphoned about $175,000 in crypto. The following month, Kim exploited the source code of smart contracts to steal $740,000.

The stolen funds were then laundered through mixers and sent to exchange accounts controlled by Kang and Chang, all set up using fraudulent Malaysian IDs, investigators said.

“These schemes target and steal from US companies and are designed to evade sanctions and fund the North Korean regime's illicit programs, including its weapons programs,” said John A. Eisenberg, assistant attorney general for national security.

The case was part of the DOJ's DPRK RevGen: Domestic Enabler Initiative, a program launched in 2024 targeting North Korea's illicit revenue streams and US-based enablers.

In another incident, federal agents also conducted coordinated raids across 16 states, seizing almost 30 financial accounts, over 20 fraudulent websites and about 200 computers from so-called “laptop farms” that enabled North Korean operatives to appear as though they were working from the US.

The DOJ announced Sunday that the schemes involved North Korean IT workers posing as US citizens, using stolen identities to gain jobs at over 100 American companies, funneling millions to Pyongyang and even accessing sensitive military data.

Last month, the DOJ filed a civil forfeiture complaint to seize $7.74 million in crypto allegedly earned by North Korean IT workers posing as remote blockchain contractors by using fake identities.

Mastercard is deepening its push into crypto with plans to hire two senior leaders focused on digital assets and blockchain.

The payments giant is recruiting for a Vice President, Head of Digital Assets Ecosystem Growth, and a Vice President, Head of Financial Institutions (FI) Growth, both based in  the U.S.

“Excited to share two open roles on my team as Mastercard continues to build the next generation of payments and drive innovation across digital assets,” Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard's head of crypto and blockchain, wrote in a LinkedIn post.

The first role will oversee strategic partnerships across the digital asset sector, working with issuers, infrastructure providers and startups to scale solutions like Mastercard's Multi-Token Network (MTN) and Crypto Credential. The second role will focus on collaborating with financial institutions to develop blockchain uses, such as business payments, cross-border transactions and tokenized assets.

Mastercard has been among the most active traditional finance firms exploring crypto, establishing ties across the ecosystem for years. Most recently, the company announced plans to integrate more stablecoins into its global payments network, building on existing support for Circle's USDC. It is also rolling out stablecoin-based cross-border transactions through Mastercard Move.

In an interview with CoinDesk earlier this year, Dhamodharan said Mastercard's goal is to act as a bridge between blockchain networks and traditional finance, providing regulatory clarity while enabling new business models.

He added that financial institutions need to “be very open to making [crypto] available as broadly as possible.”

What if using blockchain technology was as simple as saying ""I want to buy concert tickets"" instead of navigating through multiple wallets, bridges, and complex transaction sequences? What if the blockchain could understand your intentions and execute them seamlessly across multiple networks without you having to think about gas fees, slippage, or technical complexities?

This isn't a distant dream—it's the reality that Anoma is building today. In a world where using cryptocurrency still feels like performing digital surgery for most people, Anoma is pioneering an ""intent-centric"" approach that could finally make blockchain technology as intuitive as sending a text message.

The Problem with Today's Blockchain Experience

Let's be honest: using decentralized applications today is like trying to order a coffee by explaining the molecular structure of caffeine. Want to swap some Bitcoin for Ethereum? You'll need to understand gas fees, choose the right bridge, worry about slippage, and pray you don't accidentally send your tokens to the wrong address.

The current blockchain ecosystem is fragmented across dozens of networks, each with its own rules, tokens, and user interfaces. Users need multiple wallets, must understand the intricacies of each blockchain, and often lose money to failed transactions or human error. It's no wonder that despite blockchain's revolutionary potential, mainstream adoption remains elusive.

This fragmentation isn't just inconvenient—it's fundamentally limiting what's possible with decentralized technology. Developers are forced to choose between chains, liquidity is scattered, and users are trapped in isolated ecosystems.

Enter the Intent Revolution

Anoma's solution is elegantly simple in concept but revolutionary in execution: instead of forcing users to specify exactly how they want something done, let them simply express what they want to achieve.

Think of it like the difference between giving someone turn-by-turn directions to a restaurant versus just telling them you want to have dinner there. With traditional blockchain transactions, you're forced to provide the turn-by-turn directions. With Anoma's intent-centric model, you just say ""I want dinner,"" and the system figures out the best route.

In practical terms, this means a user could express an intent like ""I want to buy an NFT using my Bitcoin"" without needing to understand that this requires converting Bitcoin to Ethereum, bridging to the right network, approving multiple smart contracts, and executing the purchase. Anoma's network handles all of that complexity behind the scenes.

The Technology Behind the Magic

Anoma's innovation rests on what they call the ""Intent Machine""—a sophisticated system that processes user intentions and converts them into executable actions across multiple blockchains. But the real magic happens in the decentralized solver network.

Imagine a global network of problem-solvers constantly scanning for ways to fulfill user intents. When you express an intent to swap tokens, these solvers compete to find the most efficient path, often discovering opportunities you never would have found on your own. They might find arbitrage opportunities, better exchange rates, or more efficient routing that actually saves you money while fulfilling your intent.

Privacy by Design

What sets Anoma apart from centralized solutions is its commitment to privacy. Using advanced cryptographic techniques including zero-knowledge proofs, Anoma ensures that your financial intents and transactions remain private. You control exactly what information gets shared and when, maintaining the privacy principles that make decentralized finance revolutionary.

This isn't just about hiding your transaction history—it's about programmable data sovereignty. You can specify complex privacy preferences: ""I want to trade these tokens, but don't reveal my identity unless the counterparty meets certain criteria,"" for example.

True Interoperability

While other projects have attempted to solve blockchain interoperability, most solutions feel like digital duct tape—functional but clunky. Anoma takes a different approach by creating what they call a ""distributed operating system"" that treats all connected blockchains as a single, unified environment.

This means developers can build applications that seamlessly operate across Ethereum, Bitcoin, Cosmos, and any other compatible blockchain without having to understand the technical complexities of each network. For users, it means the blockchain wars become irrelevant—you just use the best application for your needs, regardless of which chain it lives on.

The Numbers Tell a Story

Anoma's vision has attracted serious attention from the investment community. The project has raised $60.25 million across multiple funding rounds, with backing from heavyweight investors like Polychain Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Electric Capital, and Delphi Digital.

But what's particularly interesting about Anoma's funding structure is how it balances institutional investment with community ownership. While 32% of tokens are allocated to backers, significant portions are reserved for the ecosystem (17%) and future public programs (16.3%), suggesting a commitment to decentralized ownership rather than pure venture capital control.

Community-Driven Innovation

Recent developments show Anoma's commitment to building a genuine community rather than just attracting speculators. The project has allocated 1% of its total token supply as rewards for community engagement, with 0.7% going to active community promoters and 0.3% supporting the broader ecosystem.

This approach recognizes that blockchain technology succeeds or fails based on network effects—the more people using and building on the platform, the more valuable it becomes for everyone. By incentivizing genuine community participation rather than just token holding, Anoma is investing in its long-term sustainability.

Real-World Applications

The potential applications of intent-centric blockchain technology extend far beyond simple token swaps. Imagine:

Complex DeFi Strategies: Instead of manually managing liquidity across multiple protocols, you could express an intent like ""maximize my yield while keeping risk below X%"" and let the network optimize your positions automatically.

NFT and Gaming: ""Buy the best weapon for my character under $100"" could trigger a search across multiple NFT marketplaces and gaming platforms, finding options you never knew existed.

Event Tickets and Real-World Assets: ""Get me two tickets to the concert next week"" could automatically search across multiple platforms, compare prices, verify authenticity, and complete the purchase using whatever tokens you have available.

Automated Philanthropy: ""Donate 2% of my portfolio gains to climate projects"" could automatically execute regular donations based on your portfolio performance, finding the most effective organizations and handling all the technical details.

Challenges and Skepticism

Not everyone is convinced that intent-centric blockchain is ready for prime time. Critics point to the complexity of building secure solver networks and the potential for unintended consequences when systems try to interpret human intentions.

Recent community discussions have also raised questions about whether Anoma will prioritize community members who test and support the network or focus on institutional partnerships and exchange listings. With $60+ million in funding, some community members worry about the project's commitment to decentralization principles.

These concerns aren't trivial. The history of blockchain is littered with projects that started with decentralization principles but gradually centralized as they scaled. Anoma's challenge will be maintaining its community-first ethos while delivering on its technical promises.

The Philosophical Shift

Beyond the technical innovations, Anoma represents a fundamental philosophical shift in how we think about blockchain technology. Instead of viewing blockchains as separate, competing networks, Anoma envisions them as components of a larger, unified system.

This shift from competition to cooperation could unlock possibilities we haven't even imagined yet. When developers can build across all blockchains simultaneously, when users can access all of DeFi through simple intentions, and when privacy and interoperability are built-in rather than bolted-on, we might finally see blockchain technology fulfill its promise of financial sovereignty and programmable money.

Looking Ahead

As we move deeper into 2025, Anoma continues to develop its technology and grow its community. The project's open-source approach means developers worldwide can contribute to its evolution, while its intent-centric model could make blockchain technology accessible to the billions of people who currently find it too complex to use.

The success of Anoma won't just be measured in token price or market capitalization—it'll be measured by whether it actually makes blockchain technology disappear into the background, becoming as invisible and intuitive as the internet infrastructure we rely on every day.

The Bottom Line

Anoma isn't just another blockchain project—it's a bet on a fundamentally different future for decentralized technology. If successful, it could be the bridge that finally connects blockchain's revolutionary potential with mainstream usability.

For the crypto community, Anoma represents an evolution from the technical complexity that has defined the space toward the user-friendly applications that could drive mass adoption. For the broader technology world, it's a glimpse of what happens when we stop forcing humans to speak computer and start building computers that understand human intentions.

Whether Anoma can deliver on its ambitious vision remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: projects like this are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with decentralized technology. In a space often dominated by speculation and hype, Anoma's focus on solving real usability problems offers hope that blockchain technology might finally be growing up.

The intent-centric future may still be developing, but if Anoma succeeds, using blockchain technology could soon be as natural as expressing a wish—and watching it come true.

Crypto World News

July 2, 2025 by Tina Fatima 

Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has become an unusual exception in the crypto space that has gone sideways and is indecisive. The meme token has registered an impressive 50% appreciation over the last week, with a further 8% appreciation over the last 24 hours. 

That strong pricing has even caught the attention of traders and NFT enthusiasts. As of now, PENGU is being exchanged for $0.01470 against a market capitalization of $924.67 million. 

Its 24-hour volume has registered a decline of 14% to $554.9 million. Despite this decline in volume, optimism for the token remains strong, mainly due to fresh interest in the token NFT community.

Also Read: PENGU Forms Bullish Double Bottom: Breakout Toward $0.01650 in Sight

One of PENGU's key momentum drivers has been an uptick of fresh interest in its parent Pudgy Penguins NFT protocol. CryptoSlam data revealed a 38% increase in NFT volumes that collectively earned a total of $1.5 million in volumes last week. 

The spike has caused a crucial shift in market attention to the protocol. Additionally, volumes of transactions expanded 36%, buyers expanded 48%, and sellers expanded 32%. 

Strong participation in the base demonstrates that trust in the brand of the token expanded considerably to make it the 10th most traded NFT series during this period. It fell behind bluechip projects like CryptoPunks and Gods Unchained but outpaced a few others in their industry.

Cryptanalyst Honey explained that PENGU has been one of the most stable and profitable tokens to hold in recent months, especially when pitted against other alts that have not been able to maintain their prices. 

Honey explained that even with most of the altcoin space being in a downtrend, the token has consistently registered gains, a sign of strength and relative leadership in the market.

The analyst also commented that it's a favored strategy to maintain winning trades like tokens in these market circumstances and hoped that the token would bounce back toward the $0.025 resistance point in the coming days if bullish momentum continues.

That argument accompanies growing support among technical traders and community members in hopes of seeing additional potential for an upward move.

While lower trading volume can suggest a short-term correction, the token's fundamental strengths of brand value, meme factor, and high sentiment of the community are intact. 

These remaining strong and consistent, PENGU can not only challenge but even cross the $0.020 to $0.025 value threshold in the days to come.

The top team of the new Information Commission is starting to take shape after current deputy chief executive and chief operating officer Paul Arnold has been named the first CEO of the future regulator.
Under changes laid out in the Data (Use & Access) Act, the watchdog's governance structure will be brought in line with other UK regulators, which have more of a corporate composition. Out will go the Commissioner and in will come a chair (current commissioner John Edwards), a CEO and a board of non-executive directors.
It is claimed the move will make the organisation more resilient as a regulator, increasing the diversity of its strategic leadership.
Arnold has been appointed following a recruitment process that concluded in May of this year. His immediate priority is to ensure a smooth transition for the ICO to the new Commission. He will also be ensuring that the first strategy is developed effectively and that the ICO's ongoing transformation continues during the transition.
With over 25 years' experience, the past 15 at the ICO, Arnold insists his approach to regulation combines supporting economic growth while protecting people from harm. This means empowering people to confidently share their information to use the products and services that drive our economy and our society, while helping organisations to responsibly use information to invest and innovate.
He has overseen the development and transformation of the ICO through many periods of societal and economic change. These include the evolution of cloud computing and online services, the rise of social media platforms, the implementation of GDPR and changes to how people live and work following a global pandemic.
As a severely visually impaired person, Arnold is passionate about equality of access to opportunity and showcasing the importance and potential of people like him, doing jobs like his, making it easy for others to expect to do the same. He is also a trustee of RNIB and chair of the National Visually Impaired Football League.
Recognising that a permanent CEO cannot be appointed until the Commission board is in place, Arnold's appointment is for a maximum two-year interim period until a permanent recruitment process is then undertaken.
Arnold said: “I believe we have a fantastic opportunity to demonstrate how effectively protecting and safeguarding people also enables responsible businesses and organisations to innovate and grow.”
The recruitment process for the non-executive directors to join the future Information Commission board is a public appointments process, recently launched by Department for Science, Innovation & Technology.

Business Stablecoin hype dims BOK's CBDC ambition

Central bank's 'Han River' project loses traction due to high cost, low feasibility

South Korea is poised to take a major step in digital finance with the push for a stablecoin tied to the Korean won. But as enthusiasm for private-led innovation grows, the Bank of Korea's central bank digital currency project appears to have lost steam.

The shift underscores the country's lack of a coherent roadmap for integrating digital assets into its financial system, even as the transition to digital finance approaches a pivotal moment.



BOK backs off

The BOK recently notified local banks that the second phase of its central bank digital currency testing program, titled “Project Han River,” has been put on hold.

In April, the central bank launched the first phase of a pilot program to test the feasibility of a digital currency. Over a three-month test period, participants used tokenized deposits to purchase goods and services.

The second leg of the pilot project was to take place in the fourth quarter, testing additional features such as person-to-person transfers and a simplified verification process. But the BOK has suspended the plan.

""We plan to resume testing after thoroughly reviewing institutional changes, such as the clarification of stablecoin-related legislation. Once the uncertainties are somewhat resolved, we will discuss effective testing measures with participating institutions,"" a BOK official said.

The suspension stems from the participating banks' uneasiness about the project, burdened by the costs of setting up the infrastructure for testing. The banks reportedly spent a combined 30 billion won ($22 million), a significant amount considering the absence of a clear timeline for full-scale implementation.



Are stablecoins, CBDCs at odds?

While banks remain doubtful about the implementation of a CBDC, they are eager to take the lead in the won-backed stablecoin market.

In recent weeks, banks have been competitively filing trademark applications, combining KRW, the currency code for the Korean won, with abbreviations of their names. They are also launching task forces and seeking to launch joint ventures with tech partners.

""Stablecoins are not a far-fetched idea. They have already become a part of the economy,"" an official from a local lender said. ""Stablecoins allow for more concrete business discussions, while the institutionalization of CBDCs remains uncertain.""

Both stablecoins and CBDCs function as forms of payment, with stable values pegged to a fiat currency. However, they are also fundamentally different: CBDCs are state-issued payment instruments, while stablecoins are operated by the private sector.

“CBDCs are advantageous in terms of financial stability and settlement finality, while stablecoins excel in technological innovation and global scalability,” Lee Jung-su, associate professor of international financial transactions, said at a policy meeting held in May.

“The closed nature of CBDCs poses limitations in terms of international interoperability and geopolitical risks. In contrast, stablecoins offer greater flexibility with cost efficiency and cross-chain compatibility.”

Though the two digital currencies are not mutually exclusive, the growing momentum for stablecoins could delay the rollout of a CBDC. If a stablecoin establishes itself as a major component of the digital asset market, the CBDC could lose ground.



On the verge

With a CBDC set aside for the moment, the question now lies in who will be allowed to issue won-backed stablecoins.

The ruling Democratic Party of Korea has proposed allowing nonbanking entities to issue them. The BOK remains cautious on the move, however, as the unchecked issuance of won-based stablecoins by nonbanking entities could undermine the effectiveness of the bank's policy tools.

Experts highlight that Korea is at a crucial turning point in shaping its digital finance landscape.

“When it comes to changes in the financial sector, it is always a question of finding a balance between stability and innovation. For the time being, Korea is on the brink of transformation,” said Lee Hyo-seob, a senior research fellow at Korea Capital Market Institute.

“Now is the time to prioritize innovation and from that perspective, nonbanking institutions can play a bigger role.”

The Bank of Korea (BOK) has reportedly halted its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project following the South Korean government's focus on stablecoins. The shift has left project participants with “no long-term roadmap” and banks pivoting to this sector.

On Sunday, local news outlet Yonhap News Agency reported that the Bank of Korea had notified banks participating in the Han River Project that the second phase of CBDC testing would be suspended.

The BOK and seven banks began the first phase of testing in April, targeting 100,000 financial consumers and planning to complete it by June 30. Originally, the project was scheduled to start its second phase at the end of the year, testing peer-to-peer transfers, expanding payment merchant locations, and simplifying authentication methods.

However, banks reportedly raised concerns about the “excessive cost burden without concrete plans for commercialization,” leading to the project's pause. Notably, the banking sector is bearing the cost of the project and recently demanded that the Bank of Korea provide a clear long-term roadmap with plans for commercialization.

Banks requested the BOK to “establish a ‘CBDC General User Real-Transaction Test Task Force' involving all relevant departments of the Bank of Korea and banks to develop a long-term roadmap including post-test commercialization plans, and then realistically adjust the project schedule based on this roadmap.”

As a result, the BOK has concluded that it must clarify its internal stance and schedule regarding digital assets, as stablecoin momentum grows and discussions in the National Assembly and the private sector intensify.

According to a senior official at a commercial bank, the Bank of Korea explained that it would “wait and see how the situation develops, given that the legalization of stablecoins is currently underway, while it is unclear how CBDC, stablecoins, and deposit tokens differ and can coexist.”

Similarly, another senior official affirmed that the atmosphere is shifting toward stablecoins, detailing that “Until the dinner meeting between Bank of Korea Governor Lee Chang-yong and bank presidents on the 23rd, the atmosphere was not like this, but the situation has changed significantly since then.”

Nonetheless, the Han River Project could be reconsidered in 2026, according to another bank official, who claimed that the Bank of Korea mentioned the possibility of revisiting CBDC testing and “pushing forward with it around the first half of next year.”

Following this development, banks participating in the CBDC project are expected to shift to stablecoin issuance as related legislation gains support, preparing for issuance with other banks or non-bank entities.

 At the start of the month, a member of South Korea's ruling party, Min Byeong-deok, introduced a comprehensive bill to establish a more structured regulatory framework for crypto assets in the country.

As reported by Bitcoinist, the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) lawmaker proposed the Digital Assets Basic Act to complement the Virtual Asset Investor Protection Act and offer a broader legal foundation for the industry.  Additionally, it focuses on implementing a licensing system for stablecoin issuers and clear rules.

The banking sector is considering a business model in which banks establish a joint venture to collectively issue stablecoins, while contacting various non-bank companies to prepare for the legalization and issuance of stablecoins.

A bank official affirmed that “It is unclear whether banks or big tech (large IT companies) and fintech (financial technology companies) will be the issuers of stablecoins,” adding that they “have no choice but to prepare for both scenarios before legalization.”

Another bank official stated that it is necessary to collaborate with fintech companies for scalability, explaining that banks are “not only discussing stablecoins with the Bank of Korea and other banks, but also meeting regularly with ‘payment' companies, cryptocurrency exchanges, and blockchain companies to prepare for the issuance of stablecoins.”

Project Han River halted amid cost concerns and regulatory uncertainty over digital currency framework.

South Korea's central bank has temporarily paused its wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) and tokenized deposit project following pushback from participating commercial banks, according to multiple Korean press reports on Monday. 

The Bank of Korea's Project Han River, which involved seven major banks in digital currency trials, has been put on hold as the same institutions pivot toward launching their own stablecoin consortium.

The pause comes after the completion of the first phase of tokenized deposit trials, which concluded on June 30 and involved experiments with 100,000 participants using tokenized deposits for consumers and wholesale CBDC for bank settlements. The project was scheduled to advance to a second phase later this year, but discussions about the next round of tests have been temporarily suspended.

Commercial banks were reportedly informed of the delay on June 26, though the Bank of Korea has not made a formal public announcement. The seven participating institutions—KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Hana, Woori, NH NongHyup, Industrial Bank of Korea, and one additional bank—had collectively spent approximately 35 billion won ($26 million) on the initial testing phase.

The project faces pressure from two directions: financial constraints and regulatory uncertainty. Banks have expressed concerns about the high costs of participation with unclear commercialization prospects. Central bank Governor Rhee Chang-yong personally visited the CEOs of each participating bank last month, offering to cover some costs for phase two, but financial considerations represent only part of the challenge.

A senior commercial bank official told Yonhap news that the Bank of Korea's explanation centers on legislative uncertainty: ""Since the legislation of stablecoins is currently in progress while it is not clear how CBDC, stablecoins, and deposit tokens differ and can coexist, they will wait and see how the situation develops.""

The central bank is also grappling with technical questions, including whether to allow tokenized deposits on public blockchains. Discussion of the project may resume in the first half of 2026, according to reports.

With the Korean government moving to enable broader stablecoin issuance, the same banks struggling with CBDC costs are now planning their own stablecoin consortium. This shift suggests financial institutions view private digital currencies as a more commercially viable path forward than government-backed alternatives.

The banking consortium represents one of two major stablecoin initiatives emerging in Korea. Large crypto investor Hashed is simultaneously creating a separate consortium involving crypto exchanges and securities firms, similar to the Paxos Global Dollar initiative but denominated in Korean won.

Korea's experience may signal broader trends in digital currency development worldwide. European banks have voiced similar concerns about the high costs associated with a digital euro retail CBDC, with some also exploring stablecoin alternatives. The contrast highlights how private stablecoins are gaining momentum while central banks wrestle with complex technical, coordination, and regulatory challenges.

The timing coincides with peak interest in stablecoins globally, including reports of major corporations like Amazon and Walmart considering their own digital currency initiatives. This development comes as Bank for International Settlements, led by a committee chaired by Governor Rhee Chang-yong, appeared to harden its stance toward stablecoins last week, characterizing them as ""unsound money.""

The Korean experience suggests that CBDCs and stablecoins may not simply coexist but actively compete, with private alternatives potentially holding first-mover advantages and lower implementation costs. This dynamic could reshape how countries approach digital currency strategies, particularly as regulatory frameworks for both CBDCs and stablecoins continue to evolve.

Local reports indicate that South Korea's central bank has suspended its central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot program, pivoting the nation's focus toward a private, bank-led stablecoin initiative.

The Bank of Korea (BOK) halted its “Project Han River,” following mounting pressure from commercial banking partners who cited prohibitive costs and the absence of a viable business model, as The Korea Herald reported.

The project launched earlier this year was a two-tier system involving a wholesale CBDC for interbank settlement and tokenized deposits for retail use by 100,000 citizens. However, the seven participating banks collectively spent nearly 35 billion won (about $26 million) on the initial three-month phase and were unwilling to proceed without a clear path to profitability.

A last-minute offer from BOK Governor Rhee Chang-yong to cover half the costs for the project's second phase was rejected, signaling that the banks' concerns were fundamental to the business case, not just the expense.

In the vacuum left by the state-led project, a consortium of eight major commercial banks, including KB Kookmin, Shinhan, and Woori, has formed to develop a won-pegged stablecoin. This initiative is actively supported by the Korea Financial Telecommunications and Clearings Institute (KFTC) and aims for a public launch in late 2025 or early 2026.

The banks see a clear commercial advantage in issuing their own stablecoins, leveraging their customer base to create new revenue streams and prevent disintermediation from fintech rivals or a state-run currency.

This strategic pivot was enabled by a shift in government policy under President Lee Jae-myung, who campaigned on a pro-crypto platform that included a promise to approve won-pegged stablecoins.

President Lee's administration is fast-tracking the “Digital Asset Basic Act,” legislation that provides a legal framework for stablecoins. The act notably grants primary regulatory authority to the Financial Services Commission (FSC), not the Bank of Korea, and sets a low capital requirement of ₩500 million (about $370,000) to encourage competition.

The private sector has moved aggressively to secure its position. KB Kookmin, the nation's largest bank, filed for 17 different trademarks for potential stablecoin tickers like KBKRW, which it called a “preemptive move.” Meanwhile, Shinhan Bank has been preparing for this moment for years, conducting international remittance proofs-of-concept with stablecoins as far back as November 2021.

While BOK Governor Rhee has publicly conceded that won-backed stablecoins are necessary, he and other central bank officials continue to express grave concerns. They warn that a proliferation of private stablecoins could undermine monetary policy, create systemic risk reminiscent of the 2022 Terra/Luna collapse, and accelerate capital flight as users swap won-stablecoins for dollar-pegged alternatives.

The volume of USD-pegged stablecoin transactions in Korea reached ₩56.95 trillion ($41.6 billion) in the first quarter of 2025 alone.

The central bank has advocated for a more cautious rollout, preferring that only highly regulated banks be allowed to issue stablecoins initially before expanding to non-bank entities.

In the meantime, the BOK has framed its suspended CBDC work as a potential “countermeasure to stablecoins,” a public option to be revived if the private market proves too volatile.

Circle, the company behind the $USDC stablecoin announced on June 30 that it has applied for a national trust bank charter.

With a blockchain banking revolution on the horizon, which altcoins could be poised to benefit?

Circle's trust banking license aspirations follow its landmark IPO that valued the company at approximately $18B.

Circle's USDC reserves, currently held and managed by BNY Mellon and BlackRock, would now benefit from in-house oversight, increasing credibility with institutional players.

Compliance with the license demands that it not cross into deposit-taking or lending. This could be subject to change, of course, as the regulatory environment in the US clarifies.

So far, meeting compliance standards has led Circle to prioritize seeking licenses:

CEO Jeremy Allaire emphasized Circle's commitment to building ‘an internet financial system that is transparent, efficient, and accessible.'

The timing of the move isn't just about the IPO; it also aligns well with US regulatory currents, including the GENIUS stablecoin bill now advancing through Congress.

That bill mandates clear reserve structures and full transparency to help normalize stablecoin use within legacy financial institutions.

TradFi is increasingly exploring blockchain as a remedy to its woes.

Aave founder Stani Kulechov highlighted the benefits blockchain brings to TradFi: unmatched global reach, instant access to digital financial products, and a global customer base.

Hurdles remain, of course. Fragmented interoperability between tokens and blockchains hampers liquidity and cross-chain transactions. There are proposed solutions, though, such as Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which aims to knit together disparate blockchains as logically as the internet connects different networks.

Kulechov envisions a future where DeFi protocols like Aave serve as global financial utilities, unhindered by siloed systems.

Reports that a banking consortium including JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo is considering issuing its own stablecoin overlook a salient point:

TradFi will also have to overcome an increasingly strong first-mover advantage wielded by Circle and others. As Todd Ruoff, CEO of Autonomys, said, ‘the rules were written by crypto natives.'

Circle is covered by licenses in 46 US states, plus by New York BitLicense, along with a $USDC market cap hovering around $61B. That's a big hurdle for any new TradFi/crypto banks to overcome.

While the banks plan their entry into blockchain, these three altcoins are poised to make big gains.

The key to First National Digital Assets Bank could rest in your crypto wallet. That's why you need the toughest crypto wallet around.

Best Wallet provides a simple, secure, and straightforward way to store and use crypto. With MPC and biometric security and the ability to create multiple wallets, you can buy, store, and swap crypto securely, all within a single, powerful Web3 wallet.



When you load it up with the native $BEST token, you get even more utility from your wallet, including:

Select crypto presales are available directly within the Best Wallet app, making researching and purchasing the hottest crypto presales easier than ever.

Learn how to buy Best Wallet Token and see why our own price prediction sees $BEST moving from its current $0.025265 to a potential $0.62 by 2026.

Visit the presale page to buy or learn more.

You want meme coins — the frenetic energy, crazy gains, and potential for wild swings that every degen craves.

But you won't find those on your mainstream CEXs – at least, not very often. Most of the time, the best action comes from low-cap tokens trading underground on sites like Telegram. But how do you find them?

That's where Snorter Bot and the $SNORT token come in.



What is Snorter? It's the best way to hunt down the best Solana meme coins, with all the tools you need to trade with confidence. This includes:

And with the $SNORT token you'll get lower trading fees and better access to new tokens. It's one of the reasons our $SNORT price prediction sees the token climbing to $0.94 from its current $0.0967, delivering 872% gains by the end of 2026.

Learn how to buy Snorter Token and visit the presale page.

Donald Trump has gone big on crypto, both in his administration and personally. World Liberty Financial, his official crypto project, is one of his biggest moves.

There was a World Liberty Financial presale for its governance token, $WLFI, a few months ago, but the biggest offering from the project so far has been $USD1, a dollar-based stablecoin.

There's no room for big gains with $USD1 itself, but the token could anchor a much more significant crypto ecosystem from a US president who already has a stablecoin and his own meme coin.

In the meantime, $WLFI recently attracted a $100M investment from the UAE as international investors see the potential benefits of Trump's global crypto aspirations.

Circle's trust bank charter application is under regulatory review; approval would mark a significant milestone in bridging the TradFi and blockchain worlds.

With Circle's bank charter bid, regulatory advances, DeFi's global potential, and the rise of institutional stablecoins, all the elements are emerging for an intertwined financial ecosystem.

These three altcoins could be in line to benefit, but always do your own research. This isn't financial advice.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Paxos launches Global Dollar USDG in the EU","https://www.ledgerinsights.com/paxos-launches-global-dollar-usdg-in-the-eu/","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 07:50:47 GMT","

Paxos, the issuer of the Global Dollar stablecoin (USDG) has launched it in the EU in compliance with the local MiCA regulations. Some of the initial distributors in Europe include Kraken and Gate. The issuer shares most of the revenues it earns on the stablecoin's reserves with distribution partners, a model that represents a departure from industry norms.

“USDG is a fully regulated global USD-stablecoin that is compliant with MiCA and now available in the EU, a testament to our commitment to offering global digital assets that are supervised by prudential regulators and also meet the highest standards of consumer protection,” said Walter Hessert, Head of Strategy at Paxos.  “We're excited to partner with some of the leading players in Europe to bring this leading standard of compliance to more than 450 million consumers in the European Union.”

On a global basis, USDG has several high profile distribution partners including Anchorage Digital, Fiserv, Kraken, Mastercard, Robinhood and Worldpay. But it's still early days for the stablecoin, with a total issuance of $320 million.



The digital currency was originally issued under Singapore laws, where Paxos is also regulated. Last year the company acquired Finland's Membrane Finance with an existing MiCA license to operate across Europe, which has been re-named to Paxos Issuance Europe.

Today's launch touches on a topical area – how same brand stablecoins are fungible across jurisdictions. The EU has particular requirements for stablecoin reserves, demanding that smaller stablecoins such as USDG hold 30% as cash in local bank accounts. This regulatory framework creates operational complexities for global stablecoin management.

Despite holding separate backing assets for the EU issued electronic money tokens (EMTs) there is only one smart contract on each blockchain representing stablecoins issued globally. In practice this is managed by re-balancing reserves. The EU requires crypto exchanges to report to EMT issuers on a daily basis, so Paxos will know roughly how many stablecoins are issued in the EU, except for self hosted balances. Hence, it can ensure sufficient data to manage reserve rebalancing, and its white paper said it will rebalance on at least a weekly basis. At the current scale that makes sense, but as it grows it will probably be more regular.

EU parliamentarians are not happy about this rebalancing process as they worry that in a crisis non EU residents will redeem via Europe because it's cheaper and available direct from the issuer. When drafting MiCA they deliberately chose not to recognize third country stablecoin issuance and they believe this methodology is tantamount to doing so.

Avery Ching, co-founder and CEO of Aptos Labs, has joined CFTC's digital asset market subcommittee, which includes experts from major financial institutions like BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and Citadel to advise on digital asset regulations. This partnership will pave the way for a broader institutional framework for crypto and other digital currencies. 

Avery Ching's Collaboration With CFTC

On June 30, Aptos Labs, a blockchain technology company, announced its partnership with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) Global Market Advisory Committee ( GMAC) to explore the complex landscape of cryptocurrency. 

Aptos Labs states– 

“Avery will collaborate with other leaders from Web3 and financial services to help shape digital asset regulations.”

The collaboration aims to boost Web3 and financial services while shaping the framework for digital assets. Ching's partnership with CFTC is poised to reshape the crypto regulatory playbook. 

Avery Ching's CFTC Collaboration Signals New Era For Crypto

Formerly, Ching helped in developing a Layer 1 blockchain infrastructure at Aptos, which gained him recognition for his rare technological and leadership experience. His experience in engineering and regulatory navigation will set him apart in the CFTC panel, which was long dominated by finance professionals. 

This collaboration represents a strategic move towards a balanced crypto regulatory landscape, which allows him to navigate both technological and regulatory domains. His former experience with Meta Diem equips him to contribute to the ongoing discussions regarding decentralized finance, digital asset classification, and risk management.  [post_titles_links postid=""477301""] 

Aptos's Evolution in the Digital Assets Space

While the CFTC subcommittee is intensifying scrutiny on stablecoins and central bank digital currency (CBDC), Ching's insights may shape the outcomes as Aptos engages with US states and federal regulators. The company is gaining governmental relevance as Wyoming selected Aptos for its WYST stabecoins. 

Besides, WYST, Bitwise also filed for an Aptos-linked ETF, while the company already holds three USD-pegged stablecoins. This signals the growing interest in the platform, which can be further shaped with Ching's insights on digital currencies. 

Final Thought 

With all these digital currencies in the momentum, Ching is poised to influence the development of pragmatic innovation-friendly regulations, particularly around stablecoins and ETFs. Avery Ching's insights could be a precedent for the rest of the world to follow in regulating cryptocurrency.

FAQs

Avery Ching's role is expected to significantly influence future US crypto regulations by bringing a unique ""builder's"" perspective to the CFTC. His deep technical expertise in blockchain infrastructure and decentralized finance will help bridge the gap between technology and policy, fostering more pragmatic and innovation-friendly rules for digital assets.

Ching's insights are particularly relevant for stablecoin policies. Given Aptos's involvement with Wyoming's WYST stablecoin and the platform hosting other USD-pegged stablecoins, his collaboration with the CFTC is poised to shape clear and balanced regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, focusing on classification, risk management, and market integration.

This partnership suggests a pivotal shift towards deeper integration between crypto and traditional finance. Having a blockchain technology CEO like Avery Ching advising a major financial regulator like the CFTC indicates a growing recognition that ""Web3 builders"" are essential for shaping the future of finance, promoting collaboration over pure enforcement.

                            CBEX used a ""brandjacking"" tactic, claimed to be licensed in the US, and said that a firm called ST Technologies International was responsible for the AI trading signals.
                        

mbarrassed and in debt, Edwin was left reeling after losing US$16,000 to CryptoBridge Exchange (CBEX), one of the crypto-trading platforms preying on investors in Africa.

Edwin, a Kenyan government worker who only gave his first name out of shame, first encountered CBEX on Telegram, a messaging app.

He was lured with promises of guaranteed monthly returns made possible by AI-powered trading systems, with lucrative referral bonuses, classic hallmarks of Ponzi schemes.

""I had very big plans. But I was conned both by the platform and an agent who lied he could help recover my money,"" Edwin told AFP.

When he began investing last August, there were initial returns, leading him to invest more despite lacking prior cryptocurrency trading experience.

In total, he believes he lost roughly 2.1 million shillings ($16,000), mostly from a bank loan he is now worried about needing to repay.

With exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, ""Prospects"" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape.

Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis says some $9.9 billion was lost to crypto scams globally last year.

Such scams are not new in Africa, but their scale and sophistication has grown as cryptocurrency spreads.

CBEX collapsed in April, leaving scores of investors like Edwin ruined, mainly in Kenya and Nigeria, according to media reports.

But AFP has confirmed from accessing messages on CBEX's private Telegram groups that it has since rebooted its operations despite ongoing investigations and warnings by authorities.

I'm broke

Abby, another Kenyan investor, carries the guilt of introducing 25 family and friends to CBEX.

""(They) invested so much, and it all disappeared,"" he told AFP. ""I would really love to help them recover but I'm broke.""

In Nigeria, news of CBEX's collapse led to attacks on CBEX-affiliated offices, which have since closed.

Adeoye, a Nigerian victim, lost N700,000 (about $450).

""The offer was juicy,"" he said. ""I knew it was a risk, but I thought I would be lucky to cash out before anything happened.""

CBEX used the ""brandjacking"" tactic, adopting an acronym similar to the China Beijing Equity Exchange to give it legitimacy.

The platform claimed to be licensed in the US and said ST Technologies International was responsible for the AI trading signals, allowing it to operate in Nigeria under the corporate identity of ST Technologies International Ltd (Smart Treasure/Super Technology).

It even obtained an anti-money laundering certificate from Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) this January, though the EFCC has clarified that this was only for ""consultancy services"", not for currency exchanges.

Build trust

To add further legitimacy, CBEX claimed it was established a decade ago and the ST team eight years ago. In reality, it began operations in Nigeria last July, according to local media, before spreading to Kenya.

""If you check CBEX wallet addresses on-chain, they were only operating for about a year before the collapse,"" Kenyan cryptocurrency investigator Wycklife Sewe told AFP.

While pretending to actively trade, CBEX actually moved funds out of investors' wallets via TRON (a decentralised blockchain network), said Sewe.

The assets then underwent complex routing through multiple wallets and cryptocurrency conversions to obscure the audit trail.

""They have designed their system using code to fool you that your money is still there and you can see it growing. But your money is moved immediately after you deposit,"" Sewe said, adding that CBEX was also running other scams.

CBEX has changed its website domain several times to avoid attracting attention. AFP found at least four registered by it.

International warnings

In April 2024, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, an independent market regulator, issued a public alert against ""CBEX Group"". 

A recent investigation by crypto analyst Specter linked CBEX's withdrawal wallets to darknet marketplace Huione Guarantee, a Cambodia-based platform known for providing illicit tools to facilitate crypto crime.

The US Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) designated Huione Group a ""primary money-laundering concern"" in May, saying that it had facilitated more than $4 billion in illegal transactions between August 2021 and January 2025.

Following CBEX's collapse, Kenya's Capital Markets Authority issued an ""Investor Alert"" about unregulated platforms, and parliament is discussing a bill to regulate virtual assets.

Never again

Nigeria's EFCC says it has arrested two people and put out warrants for eight others in Nigeria and Kenya. A new Investments and Securities Act expressly prohibits and criminalises Ponzi schemes.

But investigations are lengthy and expensive.  

In May, the EFCC said a ""reasonable sum"" of lost funds had been recovered, without stating the amount, highlighting the complexity of converting cryptocurrencies back to national currency.

A Telegram spokesman told AFP that ""scam content is removed when discovered and offending users banned"". AFP found some CBEX Telegram groups were now labelled as scams on the platform.

On June 10, CBEX, which had previously blamed hackers for the missing funds, claimed on its Telegram channels to have ""compensated"" the lost money.

But it asked affected users to complete ""verification"" by paying a fee, a common re-scamming tactic.

For victims like Abby, the way forward is easy.

""Never, ever again! I am done,"" he said.

ARK Invest offloaded nearly $43.8 million worth of shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) on Monday.

The sale follows similar moves last week for a total of 270,984 COIN shares offloaded in the last three trading days, worth just under $95 million based on Monday's closing price of $350.49.

Coinbase shares surged to a record high of over $380 on June 26, which necessitated the sales from ARK. Cathie Wood's investment managing firm has a target weighing of its exchange-traded funds (ETFs), whereby no individual holding exceeds 10% of its total value.

This leads to a trend of ARK selling large numbers of particular shares when their prices rally and acquiring them when they dip.

ARK holds COIN in three of its ETFs: Innovation (ARKK), Next Generation Internet (ARKW) and Fintech Innovation (ARKF).

Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this article has shares in Strategy (MSTR)Strategy's (MSTR) perpetual preferred shares may be anticipating the bitcoin-accumulation company's inclusion in the S&P 500 index after the largest cryptocurrency posted a record-high monthly close at a price some analysts calculate lifted quarterly earnings to a level that qualifies it for the U.S. equity benchmark.

That may not be the only reason for their popularity, however. The stocks all offer yields above the Federal Reserve's target rate of 4.25%-4.5% at levels that may be enough to attract investor interest, especially given President Donald Trump's calls for U.S. interest rates to be lowered.

While the official announcement regarding S&P 500 inclusion is not due until September. Still, on Monday, MSTR rose 5%, pushing the stock above $400, its highest since May 22. More notable gains came from the perpetual preferred shares, STRK, which climbed 15% and STRF, which added 7.5%. The STRD shares rose 3%.

Bitcoin BTC$106,157.55 ended June at $107,750, a level that translates into a positive earnings impact of about $11 billion for Tyson Corner, Virgina-based Strategy, and boosts earnings per share to around $39.50, according to MSTR analyst Jeff Walton. That's enough for it to post a net positive figure from the most recent four quarters, the last barrier it faced to be added to the S&P 500.

Shares often rise when they join, or are expected to join, the benchmark because membership opens up greater demand from institutions who are not allowed to invest in companies that haven't made the cut.

STRK's advance pushed the price to $121 with an effective yield of 6.6%. Since its Feb. 6  launch, STRK has delivered a 42% return, outperforming both bitcoin's 11% jump and the S&P 500's 2%. The figures exclude dividend payments associated with these products. STRF now offers an effective yield of 8.8% and STRD 11.1%.

Altogether, these developments raise the question of whether recent market moves represent front running ahead of a possible inclusion of MSTR in the S&P 500 alone.

 Centrifuge partners with S&P Dow Jones Indices to launch the first tokenized S&P 500 Index fund, enabling programmable onchain index-tracking products. 

Blockchain infrastructure platform Centrifuge has teamed up with S&P Dow Jones Indices (S&P DJI) to bring the S&P 500 Index onchain for the first time, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph.

The collaboration introduces proof-of-index infrastructure for tokenized products and the debut of the first tokenized S&P 500 Index fund, per the announcement.

Built on Centrifuge's blockchain-native platform, the fund uses official S&P DJI index data to offer programmable index-tracking funds via smart contracts.

“Today is the start of an exciting chapter that extends The 500™ into new use cases and users across the globe,” said Cameron Drinkwater, chief product officer at S&P Dow Jones Indices.

The initiative clears the way for S&P DJI-licensed asset managers to launch onchain funds that align with institutional standards while harnessing the flexibility and transparency of decentralized finance.

Web3 native asset manager Anemoy Capital has secured the first license to build the Janus Henderson Anemoy S&P 500 Index Fund Segregated Portfolio. S&P DJI index data and Centrifuge power the index exposure and smart-contract infrastructure.

Nick Cherney, Janus Henderson's head of innovation, said their earlier tokenized funds with Centrifuge have gained notable traction, with one strategy reaching $1 billion in assets under management faster than any previous tokenized fund.

The S&P 500 is central to global markets, with over $1 trillion traded daily in ETFs, derivatives and other products. Bringing the index onchain will allow investors to buy, hold, trade, use it as collateral or automate portfolio strategies.

“It's about taking everything we learned in traditional markets and reimagining it with programmability, transparency, and global, 24/7 accessibility,” Centrifuge's Anil Sood said.

The tokenized S&P 500 fund will officially launch on Tuesday at the Centrifuge RWA Summit in Cannes, alongside Centrifuge's proof-of-index infrastructure, which aims to standardize tokenized index products.

Centrifuge's move to bring the S&P 500 onchain comes as industry leaders warn that tokenization alone isn't enough. Kevin de Patoul, CEO of Keyrock, told Cointelegraph that tokenization “needs actual utility” to thrive.

“If there isn't something I can do with the asset in a tokenized form that I couldn't do before, then it's just friction and cost,” he said.

De Patoul added that liquidity is also crucial for tokenized markets, noting that consistent market-making turns tokenized assets into usable financial tools.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Bitcoin ‘vertical acceleration' off the table for now: Bitfinex","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-uptrend-lagging-onchain-metrics-traders-analysts","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 03:48:07 GMT","

 Bitfinex analysts say declining Bitcoin spot volume may indicate a “local top” but all eyes will be on the performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs this week. 

Bitcoin's nearly three-month rally may be losing steam as buying pressure weakens and more traders start taking profits, crypto analysts say.

“For the first time in that uptrend, momentum has begun to fade,” Bitfinex analysts said in a markets report on Monday. 

Since Bitcoin (BTC) fell to its year-to-date low of $73,273 on April 9, it has surged almost 41% to $107,380 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.

However, the analysts warned that order flow data and onchain metrics signal that Bitcoin may be entering a period of consolidation or reaching a local top “rather than continued vertical acceleration.”

“Spot volume has cooled, taker buy pressure has weakened, and profit-taking has intensified — especially among short-term holders who rode the move from sub-$80,000 levels,” they added.

The analysts say Bitcoin's next move will depend on macro factors and ongoing institutional demand, especially from ETF inflows.

US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs have posted inflows for 14 consecutive trading days straight since June 9, amounting to $4.63 billion net inflows as of June 27, according to Farside data. 

Economist Timothy Peterson described last week's $2.2 billion inflows as “massive” and expects the streak to continue this week. “70% chance next week will be positive too, which generally correlates to upward price pressure,” Peterson said.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin traders will closely watch the Federal Reserve's July 30 interest rate decision, as lower rates are typically bullish for the crypto. The market currently estimates a 19% chance that the Fed will lower rates at that meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

Despite short-term uncertainty, analysts say the broader market structure remains strong, with higher time frame support levels still holding. “The current data points to a transition phase,” they said.

Some analysts remain bullish. Economist Donald Dean said, “Bitcoin is getting ready to move higher with tight consolidation at the volume shelf.”

Related: Bitcoin price will make history with $109K weekly, monthly close

Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards recently argued that long-term holder selling pressure has stunted the growth of Bitcoin's price despite recent moves from institutions and corporations to buy the asset.

“People are wondering why Bitcoin has been stuck at $100K so long, despite the institutional FOMO,” adding that this is mainly due to Bitcoin OGs — long-term holders — who have been “dumping on Wall Street” and “unloading their positions” since the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds launched in January 2024.

See Earth's Forests as Never Before in Biomass Satellite's First Images

New images from the European Space Agency's Biomass mission show how the satellite uses advanced radar to map flows of carbon through our planet's most precious and remote ecosystems

By Emma R. Hasson edited by Lee Billings

This image features a section of the Bolivian rainforest. Each color represents a distinct ecological feature sensed by the radar, including forests, bodies of water, wetlands, and grasslands.

Just two months after its launch, the European Space Agency (ESA) Biomass satellite is already showing us Earth in a whole new light.

On June 23 the ESA released the mission's first images, which showcase its unique capability to peer through dense vegetation to study our planet's forests and other ecosystems as never before. Using cutting-edge radar technologies, the satellite is on a five-year mission to survey forests across sprawling swaths of the globe, looking beneath their canopies to accurately assess their total woody biomass—trunks, limbs, stems, and so on. By measuring all that material and how it's changing over time, scientists can better monitor deforestation trends and track the flow of carbon through ecosystems to enhance our understanding of Earth's rapidly changing climate. The satellite is still in its six-month-long commissioning phase, but now we have a taste of what is to come.

The image shown above displays a section of the Amazon rainforest in Bolivia with the Beni River meandering through. Each color represents a different ecosystem feature: black for rivers and lakes, pink for wetlands and floodplains, green for rainforests, and purple for grasslands. The World Resources Institute's Global Forest Review ranks Bolivia among the top 10 countries with the most tree cover loss between 2001 and 2024. During this time, Bolivia lost the equivalent of 15 percent of the total forest cover it had in 2000, in large part to encroaching agricultural plots and cattle ranches. These images and their associated data can help researchers keep careful tabs on deforestation and its impacts on local and global ecosystems.

The image below highlights the satellite's power by comparing its observations with those gathered by a Biomass predecessor, ESA's Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, in the same location. The new pictures represent a significant increase in detail that is primarily owed to Biomass's main instrument: the P-band synthetic aperture radar. P-band radio waves are longer than others more typically used in such radar systems, allowing them to pass through layers of foliage, soil and other materials to create accurate three-dimensional maps of otherwise hidden landscape features.

This image from the Biomass satellite (bottom) contains a significant amount of detail not represented in the Copernicus Sentinel-2's image of the same location (top).

Because of engineering challenges as well as diplomatic ones, this is the first time P-band radar has been used in orbital Earth observations—the P-band radio frequency is typically reserved for American and European missile-detection systems. (In order to ensure it will not interfere with the U.S. Department of Defense's space-object-tracking radar systems, Biomass will not observe North and Central America, Europe, and some Arctic regions.)

The next three images below demonstrate just how deep the P-band radar can go. They display topographic features of rainforests in Indonesia, the Sahara Desert in Chad and the Transantarctic Mountains adjacent to the Nimrod Glacier in Antarctica, respectively.

Pictured above is Indonesia's mountainous Halmahera rainforest, featuring rugged topography shaped by outpourings from the numerous volcanoes that pockmark the region. One of them, the active volcano Mount Gamalama, can be seen off the coast on the far left.

The Biomass satellite's radar can reach as deep as five meters into dry sand, demonstrated in this image showing the Tibesti mountain range located in the Sahara desert in the extreme north of Chad.

Though the main goal of the Biomass satellite is to catalog forests, it will also study other environments.

Above is a portion of the Tibesti Mountains situated in the central Sahara Desert in northern Chad. Able to map features as far as five meters beneath dry sand, the satellite can reveal ancient geologic details, such as dried-up riverbeds and lakes, now buried below the Sahara's ever-shifting dunes. These data can help researchers understand past ecological changes in such regions—and could even help unearth hidden pockets of precious groundwater in arid, remote deserts.

Biomass can also penetrate into ice, pictured below, and collect information about ice-sheet structure and movement that could be used to better understand what controls the slide of glaciers into the sea.

The final image shown here, below, is the very first one the satellite produced. It displays a portion of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, highlighting the topography of the region alongside features such as rivers, wetlands and grasslands.

Only a small portion of the vast Amazon has been studied in-depth and on the ground. This is largely because of its scale and the associated difficulty of reaching some of its most remote regions. Innovative satellites like Biomass could greatly increase our knowledge of these overlooked places and similar ones around the world, helping researchers better understand—and protect—our changing planet and its myriad beautiful ecosystems.

Astronomers Brace for 10 Million Alerts a Night from Rubin Observatory

Astronomers have never had this much data available this quickly before

By Meghan Bartels edited by Lee Billings

Made from over 1,100 images captured by NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the video begins with a close-up of two galaxies then zooms out to reveal about 10 million galaxies. Those 10 million galaxies are roughly .05% of the approximately 20 billion galaxies Rubin Observatory will capture during its 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory

Bang! Whiz! Pop! The universe is a happening place—full of exploding stars, erupting black holes, zipping asteroids, and much more. And astronomers have a brand-new, superpowerful eye with which to see the changing cosmos: the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile.

The Rubin Observatory released its first images last week, and they're stunning—vast, glittering star fields that show off the telescope's massive field of view and spectacularly deep vision. But two of the endeavor's most compelling aspects are difficult to convey in any individual image, no matter how spectacular: the sheer amount of data Rubin will produce and the speed with which those data will flood into astronomers' work.

“We can detect everything that changes, moves and appears,” says Yusra AlSayyad, an astronomer at Princeton University and Rubin's deputy associate director for data management. Any time something happens in Rubin's expansive view, the observatory will automatically alert scientists who may be interested in taking a closer look. The experience will be like receiving personalized notifications from the universe.

That sounds straightforward enough—until you hear the numbers. “We're expecting approximately 10,000 alerts per image and 10 million alerts per night,” AlSayyad continues. “It's way too much for one person to manually sift through and filter and monitor themselves.” AlSayyad compares Rubin's data stream to a dashcam or a video doorbell that constantly films everything in its view. “You can't just sit there and watch it,” she says. “In order to make use of that video feed, you need data management.”

For Rubin, that means building a static image of the sky—a background template, so to speak—against which any changes will be easy to spot. The telescope will construct this static view within the first year or so of regular operations.

Once the background image for a particular section of the sky is ready, the real flood will begin. As the telescope snaps its gigantic photographs, algorithms will first automatically correct for effects such as stray light from the sky and image-blurring atmospheric turbulence. Then the algorithms will compare those tweaked images with the static template, marking every little difference—an expected 10,000 in each snapshot. There will be approximately 1,000 images per night, night after night, for as long as Rubin remains in operations.

Astronomers love data, but no one has that kind of time in a day. So each individual scientist (amateurs can sign up, too) must first enroll with the Rubin Observatory's so-called alert brokers. Users can request alerts about supernovae or asteroids, for example, then set constraints on just how interesting an event should be to trigger a notification.

Such limitations are important because, again, fielding 10 million alerts per night is an untenable prospect for anyone. “It really is a kind of overwhelming scale of data,” says Eric Bellm, an astronomer at the University of Washington and Rubin's alert production science lead.

And that flood will continue for 10 years straight as the Rubin Observatory executes its signature project, dubbed the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). During this period, the telescope will zip its view across the sky in a carefully choreographed dance that will ultimately produce the best high-definition movie of the heavens that humanity has ever conceived.

During its primary mission the Rubin Observatory will take about a thousand images every night, allowing it to scan the entire visible Southern Hemisphere sky every three to four nights.

NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory

Rubin's scientists have already sketched the basic survey, says Federica Bianco, an astronomer and data scientist at the University of Delaware and deputy project scientist at the Rubin Observatory. But many details will be worked out along the way, which will let them program the telescope to adapt to the astronomical community's interests, as well as any sudden celestial surprises.

“Ten years ago we were not really seriously thinking of gravitational-wave counterparts, which is all the rage today,” Bianco says. (These counterparts are the light-emitting sources of gravitational waves, the ripples in spacetime that scientists first measured in September 2015 using the twin Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors.)

“We truly believe that LSST itself will discover new things, will transform the way in which we think about the universe,” she adds. That means making the observatory responsive to the cosmos. “If that is true, then we need to enable changes that allow us to capture these new physics, these new phenomena.”

For some science, the discoveries will be limited by whatever the sky is gracious enough to give—a star must explode for the Rubin Observatory to spot a new supernova, for example. But a particularly intriguing case comes from planetary science within our own solar system. For centuries, astronomers have snagged observations of asteroids and comets—respectively, rocky and icy objects that swarm between and around the planets as all orbit the sun.

All that effort has put more than 1.3 million asteroids in our catalogs, but astronomers expect Rubin to identify perhaps three times that many new objects—practically without trying. When the LSST survey is running at full capacity, alerts for potential newfound asteroids will be sent straight to an international group called the Minor Planet Center, which tends a database of all such space rocks.

“We just sort of sit back and these objects will be discovered and reported to us,” says Meg Schwamb, an astronomer at Queen's University Belfast. Schwamb co-chairs the LSST Solar System Science Collaboration and has worked to estimate what the telescope will find in our cosmic neighborhood.

And because these space rocks are already out there, rattling through the solar system, Rubin will rack up discoveries quickly, Schwamb and her colleagues predict—with some 70 percent of new objects discovered during the survey's first two years.

“That, I think, is mind-blowing. That really allows us to start being able to watch these objects,” Schwamb says. “There's instant gratification.”

Not everything Rubin will study is so speedy and unsubtle; the observatory will also be an astonishingly powerful tool for probing the enigmatic dark matter that produces no light yet holds galaxies together and outweighs the normal, familiar matter we know in our daily lives. One way astronomers study this lightless stuff is to measure how dark matter gravitationally warps light from more distant objects. Researchers use that telltale effect to map the enigmatic substance's distribution across the universe.

Decades ago Anthony Tyson, now an astrophysicist at the University of California Davis, wanted to do just that. “I proposed a project to [what was then] the biggest telescope, the biggest camera that was in existence, and got turned down,” he recalls. In the long run, that failed proposal sent him down the path to build his own superlative telescope, which boasts the biggest digital camera in the world, at the Rubin Observatory, where he was founding director and is now chief scientist.

In the short run, however, he took an approach that now seems prophetic. “I decided maybe I should make another application to take the same data but for a different purpose,” he says. He and his colleagues wrote up a different proposal for the same telescope, this time pitching a study of radio-bright plasma jets emanating from around the supermassive black holes at the core of galaxies. He got the observing time—as well as the warped light from invisible clumps of dark matter strewn along the telescope's line of sight. “That was the scam,” he quips.

Now, decades later, the Rubin Observatory is opening astronomers' eyes to a new view of the universe. And while it won't observe radio light, it certainly will observe oodles of active galactic nuclei—by the tens of millions, in fact, repaying Tyson's slyly earned telescope time many times over.

Though controversy erupted when a shipwreck was declared to be the HMS Endeavour back in 2022, a new published report officially confirms it to be.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

This story is a collaboration with Biography.com

In a new report put out by the Australian National Maritime Museum, a shipwreck off the coast of Rhode Island has officially been confirmed to be the HMS Endeavour. Otherwise known as the HMB Endeavour (short for His Majesty's Bark) and later the Lord Sandwich, the sunken vessel had long been sought since it was purposefully sunk in 1778. Now, the wreckage once labeled RI 2394 has been confirmed to be that same ship, once made famous by Captain James Cook.

But if you feel like you'd actually read this same story years ago, it's not just deja vu.

As PopMech reported back in 2023, RI 2394 had previously been announced by the Australian National Maritime Museum to be the HMS Endeavour all the way back in February of 2022. But at that time, their research partners involved in the project, the Rhode Island Maritime Archeology Project, questioned the announcement, feeling that while RI 2394 was certainly a strong candidate, more research was needed to officially declare it the Endeavour.

Then, in December of 2023, the Australian National Maritime Museum reasserted their declaration, pointing to further evidence gleaned from the wreckage's pump well and bow. At that time, they stated that they “...call on the preponderance of evidence where we've got a whole series of things that tie into Endeavour. And so far, we've found lots of things that tick the boxes for it to be the Endeavour and nothing on the list which says it's not.”

Yet, only now, in this new final report for 2025, has the Rhode Island Maritime Archeology Project come to see eye to eye with the Australian National Maritime Museum. In the report's executive summary, written by Kieran Hosty & James Hunter and published by the Australian National Maritime Museum, they state that:

So now, there is no dispute. The long-sought Endeavour wreckage has officially (or officially-officially-officially) been identified.

What made the search for the Endeavour such enduring one across these centuries? As the report writes, “His Majesty's Bark (HMB) Endeavour is a significant vessel in Australian maritime history,” though they concede that it is “one that elicits mixed opinions.”:

They note that, even for those in Australia deeply aware of Captain Cook, they might not know the other role the Endeavour played, that of a “British troop transport and prison ship caught up in the American War of Independence.” Hence why the then-named Lord Sandwich was sunk near Rhode Island, only just now to be officially, formally found.

This final definitive declaration identifying the vessel isn't just the resolution of an announcement controversy from a few years back; it's the culmination of what the reports notes was “a 26-year program of archival and archaeological research.” The collaboration between the two organizations began in 1999, due in part to the state of Rhode Island having claim over all wrecks which had been scuttled in Newport Harbor in 1778, which would include whichever wreck proved to be the Endeavour.

Building on the archival research of Australian historians Mike Connell and Des Liddy and the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project's Dr Kathy Abbass, the report notes that this collaboration “led to a series of archaeological expeditions in Newport Harbor in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2004.” These endeavors to find the Endeavour consisted of “remote sensing of the seafloor, underwater survey by divers, and analysis of samples of stone, coal, timber, and sediment raised from a range of shipwreck sites of 18th-century vintage.” But none of the wreckages exhibited characteristics which could be indicative of the Lord Sandwich.

Their efforts resumed in 2015, and by 2016 they had narrowed down where in the harbor the ship had been scuttled. That allowed them to narrow a group of 13 ships sunk in 1778 down to just 5, which were, in absence of proper identification, labelled as RI 2396, RI 2397, RI 2578, RI 2393, and RI 2394.

“The two largest shipwreck sites, RI 2578 and RI 2394, were considered the most likely candidates for the remains of Lord Sandwich,” the report continues. But further analysis determined that RI 2578 didn't demonstrate enough of the requisite characteristics to be the Lord Sandwich. 

In investigating RI 2394, however, the team found a number of characteristics that looked promising, including “dimensions of a range of structural timbers” which “compare favourably with measurements taken when Endeavour was surveyed by the Royal Navy in 1768,” and procured timber samples which suggest repairs made with European timber, much in the same fashion as the Endeavour/Sandwich, “which underwent significant repairs in 1776, shortly after being sold out of naval service.”

So, after much, much analysis, all parties involved can now confidently conclude that RI 2394 is, in fact, Captain Cook's long lost HMS Endeavour/HMB Endeavour/Lord Sandwich. Now, should anyone else have any reason why this wreckage should not be identified as such, speak now or forever hold your peace.

Scientists have found that eating too much dairy could ruin your sleep. Researchers questioned more than 1,000 students about the quality of their sleep, their eating habits, and any perceived link between the two, and found a strong association between nightmares and lactose intolerance -- potentially because gas or stomach pain during the night affects people's dreams.

""Nightmare severity is robustly associated with lactose intolerance and other food allergies,"" said Dr Tore Nielsen of Université de Montréal, lead author of the article in Frontiers in Psychology. ""These new findings imply that changing eating habits for people with some food sensitivities could alleviate nightmares. They could also explain why people so often blame dairy for bad dreams!""

Sweet dreams? 

Although folk beliefs have long held that what you eat affects how you sleep, there's very little evidence to prove or disprove them. To investigate, researchers surveyed 1,082 students at MacEwan University. They asked about sleep time and quality, dreams and nightmares, and any perceived association between different kinds of dreams and different foods. They also asked about participants' mental and physical health and their relationship with food.

About a third of respondents reported regular nightmares. Women were more likely to remember their dreams and to report poor sleep and nightmares, and nearly twice as likely as men to report a food intolerance or allergy. About 40% of participants said that they thought eating late at night or specific foods affected their sleep; roughly 25% thought particular foods could make their sleep worse. People who ate less healthily were more likely to have negative dreams and less likely to remember dreams.

""We are routinely asked whether food affects dreaming -- especially by journalists on food-centric holidays,"" said Nielsen. ""Now we have some answers.""

Cheesy culprits 

Most participants who blamed their bad sleep on food thought sweets, spicy foods, or dairy were responsible. Only a comparatively small proportion -- 5.5% of respondents -- felt that what they ate affected the tone of their dreams, but many of these people said they thought sweets or dairy made their dreams more disturbing or bizarre.

When the authors compared reports of food intolerances to reports of bad dreams and poor sleep, they found that lactose intolerance was associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, nightmares, and low sleep quality. It's possible that eating dairy activates gastrointestinal disturbance, and the resulting discomfort affects people's dreams and the quality of their rest.

""Nightmares are worse for lactose intolerant people who suffer severe gastrointestinal symptoms and whose sleep is disrupted,"" said Nielsen. ""This makes sense, because we know that other bodily sensations can affect dreaming. Nightmares can be very disruptive, especially if they occur often, because they tend to awaken people from sleep in a dysphoric state. They might also produce sleep avoidance behaviors. Both symptoms can rob you of restful sleep.""

Eat well to sleep well? 

This could also explain why fewer participants reported a link between their food and their dreams than in a previous study by Nielsen and his colleague Dr Russell Powell of MacEwan University, conducted eleven years earlier on a similar population. Improved awareness of food intolerances could mean that the students in the present study ate fewer foods likely to activate their intolerances and affect their sleep. If this is the case, then simple dietary interventions could potentially help people improve their sleep and overall health.

However, besides the robust link between lactose intolerance and nightmares, it's not clear how the relationship between sleep and diet works. It's possible that people sleep less well because they eat less well, but it's also possible that people don't eat well because they don't sleep well, or that another factor influences both sleep and diet. Further research will be needed to confirm these links and identify the underlying mechanisms.

""We need to study more people of different ages, from different walks of life, and with different dietary habits to determine if our results are truly generalizable to the larger population,"" said Nielsen. ""Experimental studies are also needed to determine if people can truly detect the effects of specific foods on dreams. We would like to run a study in which we ask people to ingest cheese products versus some control food before sleep to see if this alters their sleep or dreams.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This virus infects millions—and we just discovered its secret weapon","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250630073443.htm","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 03:42:17 GMT","

New research from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and La Jolla Institute for Immunology, published today (June 30) in Nature Microbiology, reveals an opportunity for developing a therapy against cytomegalovirus (CMV), the leading infectious cause of birth defects in the United States.

Researchers discovered a previously unappreciated mechanism by which CMV, a herpes virus that infects the majority of the world's adult population, enters cells that line the blood vessels and contributes to vascular disease. In addition to using molecular machinery that is shared by all herpes viruses, CMV employs another molecular ""key"" that allows the virus to sneak through a side door and evade the body's natural immune defenses.

The finding might explain why efforts to develop prophylactic treatments against CMV have, so far, been unsuccessful. This research also highlights a new potential avenue for the development of future antiviral drugs and suggests that other viruses of the herpes family, such as Epstein-Barr and chickenpox, could use similar molecular structures to spread from one infected cell to the next while avoiding immune detection.

""If we don't know what weapons the enemy is using, it is hard to protect against it,"" said senior author Jeremy Kamil, Ph.D., associate professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at Pitt. ""We found a missing puzzle piece that represents one possible reason why immunization efforts against CMV have been unsuccessful.""

In the United States, approximately one in every 200 babies is born with congenital CMV infection. Of the babies infected, one in five will have birth defects, such as hearing loss, or go on to have long-term health challenges. For most adults, CMV infections are asymptomatic. But a CMV infection during pregnancy presents significant health risks to the unborn child and could be deadly for people who are immunosuppressed, including organ transplant recipients.

Because of the large size of its genome and its complicated molecular machinery, CMV long evaded attempts to develop prophylactic treatments. Similar to other herpes viruses, CMV relies on a protein called gH to enter cells of the vessel lining. But unlike other herpes viruses, which use a protein partner called gL to facilitate infection, the new study found that CMV replaces gL with another partner called UL116 and recruits a protein called UL141. The resulting complex of gH-UL116-UL141, called GATE by the authors, then becomes an alternative tool for breaking into cells lining the blood vessels and causing internal damage while simultaneously preventing the body's own immune system from recognizing the signs of infection.

The newly discovered GATE could become a potential vaccine target for CMV and other herpes viruses.

""Previous attempts to generate a CMV vaccine have failed, but that was before we identified the GATE complex. We hope that new strategies targeting GATE will improve our chances to combat CMV infection, and also perhaps cleanse our bodies of this lifelong infection,"" said Chris Benedict, Ph.D., associate professor at La Jolla Institute for Immunology and co-senior author of the study with Kamil and LJI professor, president & CEO Erica Ollmann Saphire, Ph.D., MBA. ""If we can develop antiviral drugs or vaccines that inhibit CMV entry, this will allow us to combat the many diseases this virus causes in developing babies and immune-compromised people.""

Other authors of this research are Michael Norris, Ph.D., of the University of Toronto; Lauren Henderson, Mohammed Siddiquey, Ph.D., both of Louisiana State University Health Shreveport; and Jieyun Yin, Ph.D., Kwangsun Yoo, Ph.D., Simon Brunel, Ph.D., Michael Mor, Ph.D., and Erica Ollmann Saphire, Ph.D., all of La Jolla Institute for Immunology.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Is that really ADHD? Why flawed trials may be misleading millions","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250701020645.htm","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 14:14:44 GMT","

Originally developed for children, the diagnosis of ADHD is often difficult to make in adults. This is partly because the diagnostic criteria are based on behaviour in children. When diagnosing adults, however, these criteria are often based on adults' subjective experiences, e.g., of having difficulty concentrating or being very impulsive.

""The rising number of adults diagnosed with ADHD raises important questions about diagnostic validity -- especially since many were never identified in childhood and are now seeking help, sometimes prompted by ADHD content on social media. That made us curious: how have randomized controlled trials on ADHD dealt with this diagnostic challenge?"" Dr. Igor Studart explains.

Moreover, ADHD shares its symptoms with a number of other mental disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, making it crucial to exclude these disorders when diagnosing ADHD. This requires a thorough diagnostic assessment by an experienced psychologist or psychiatrist.

But it is not always the case that such a thorough assessment is made. A new study from the University of Copenhagen and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil now shows that even psychiatric research into ADHD often neglects this fundamental work.

""We have examined how 292 of the most credible studies in evidence-based medicine -- the so-called randomised controlled trials -- diagnosed their adult subjects,"" says Professor of Psychiatry and Consultant Psychiatrist Julie Nordgaard, who conducted the study together with Associate Professor and Senior Researcher Mads Gram Henriksen and Dr. Igor Studart.

She continues:

""We conclude that half of the studies did not ensure a broad and thorough diagnostic assessment of the patients before the trial to rule out other disorders. This means that they can't actually know, if their subjects have other mental disorders such as depression or schizophrenia. And that's not all. More than half of the studies included subjects, who have also been diagnosed with other mental disorders, making the diagnosis even more difficult to allocate,"" Julie Nordgaard explains.

According to the researchers, these methodological shortcomings are problematic, because they imply that it is impossible to know which disorders and symptoms the treatment investigated in these trials potentially had an effect on.

""This makes the research results from many of these clinical trials difficult to utilise. Yet, the results of randomised controlled trials are considered particularly trustworthy, and they may inform the guidelines we use to treat adult ADHD patients, even though the results from many of these trials should be assessed very carefully,"" says Mads Gram Henriksen.

A need for consistent and robust diagnoses

According to the researchers, one of the problems with the diagnostic assessment in many of the clinical trials is that it seems to have been carried out by people who are not trained to do so. And often with methods that are not thorough enough.

""In 61% of the studies, they do not state who diagnosed the subjects. In only 35% of the studies, it is stated that a psychiatrist or psychologist made the diagnosis. But diagnostic assessment should always be performed by an experienced professional with the necessary training to ensure that the diagnosis is made correctly, and this should be stated in the studies' method section,"" explains Mads Gram Henriksen.

In some cases, the assessment and thus the diagnosis was made by the subject themselves, and in one particularly egregious case, it was done with the help of a computer, the researchers explain.

""In psychiatry, we really need that all diagnoses, not just ADHD, are made with the same uniform criteria and by trained professionals. Otherwise, we cannot rely on the results or compare them across studies,"" says Julie Nordgaard and concludes:

""Especially in a situation where a diagnosis such as ADHD in adults is increasing, we need to be very thorough and have a solid foundation. Otherwise, we risk too many people getting a wrong diagnosis and not being able to give them the most effective treatment. Or they risk receiving unnecessary treatment that causes side-effects.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Citizen scientists spot rare exploding star in real-time","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250701030209.htm","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 08:26:16 GMT","

Previously described as playing astronomical 'spot the difference,' Kilonova Seekers asks the public to compare the latest images of a section of night sky to an image of the same section of space taken on previous nights. Their goal - to spot new stars or significant changes in light intensity that may indicate that something remarkable has happened in space.

Published today (July 1) in Astronomy & Astrophysics, the project has announced its first published major discovery - a bright exploding star.

The object underwent an extreme brightening (increasing by 2500 times) that was not seen when compared to the image taken 2 days earlier. The quick response and diligent work of the public allowed the object to be studied and classified early in its evolution, identifying it as a cataclysmic variable star, and given the name GOTO0650.

Co-lead of Kilonova Seekers, Dr. Tom Killestein, Warwick Prize Fellow in the Astronomy and Astrophysics group, University of Warwick said: ""Kilonova Seekers is a unique opportunity for members of the public to take part in true real-time astrophysics. Remarkably, public volunteers identified this star as an object of interest within 3 1/2 hours of the image being taken by the GOTO telescopes - this discovery could have been missed among many other objects without their efforts.

""The involvement of the volunteers didn't stop there, as there was a huge follow-up response from the public. It was flagged for further observations from the Swift and Einstein Probe space observatories, and GOTO0650 was bright enough for amateur astronomers to take impressively high-quality observations of with their own equipment, which formed a key part of the paper and really helping us understand the object.""

Cataclysmic variable stars sporadically increase in brightness by large amounts before dropping back to normal levels. They are compact binary star systems, consisting of a white dwarf star stealing matter from its companion donor star. Periodically, material from the donor star hits a critical density and temperature within the disc of gas that surrounds the white dwarf, which causes an explosive outburst and bright flashes of light.

The fast response of the public enabled the team to get an unusually highly complete dataset on the star, including spectroscopy, X-ray, and UV measurements, supplemented by the impressively high-quality observations of the amateur astronomers. These observations suggest it is a period bouncer, the final state of a cataclysmic variable star, and a rare object to find even in the age of widespread wide-field imaging surveys.

Co-lead of Kilonova Seekers, Dr Lisa Kelsey, Leverhulme Early Career Fellow, Institute of Astronomy and Kavli Institute for Cosmology, Cambridge said: ""Citizen science is a powerful way to make novel serendipitous discoveries in vast datasets that would normally need to be analysed in depth by scientists.

""With over 2.8 million classifications so far, the discovery of GOTO0650 is really the pinnacle of 2 years of consistent hard work from our volunteers. Without the Kilonova Seekers volunteers flagging this object, rapid follow-up would not have been possible, and this object may have been missed entirely.""

The Kilonova Seekers Project is approaching its two-year anniversary of inviting members of the public to analyse near real-time data collected from the Warwick-led Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) project. This project takes all-sky survey images of space from two arrays of telescopes located on opposite sides of the planet -- in Spain and Australia.

The vast numbers of observations taken in these imaging surveys will soon be beyond the capacity of individual and small teams of scientists to label and validate. Citizen Science is a viable, mutually beneficial solution to avoid objects like GOTO0650 being missed.

As a shining example of such efforts, Kilonova Seekers has provided over 3,500 members of the public with the opportunity to discover supernovae and variable stars using real data. With volunteers from around the world, there is almost always someone online looking at the data in real-time.

Svetoslav Alexandrov, Kilonova Seekers Volunteer based in Bulgaria said: ""Traffic in Sofia, Bulgaria, is always awful during the mornings so I have to pass time on the bus somehow, and contributing to citizen science is an excellent way to do that! Kilonova Seekers is on the top of my list, because it's mobile-friendly and most importantly, it offers us fresh imagery almost every single day.

""I literally screamed with joy when I saw that I was going to be a co-author of the research paper. I'm certain that people on the street raised their eyebrows when they saw me screaming and dancing, but I didn't care. I knew I am a co-discoverer of something significant, and this was all that mattered""

Cledison Marcos da Silva, Kilonova Seekers Volunteer based in Brazil said: ""This discovery was very important to me, as I was going through a serious health problem and the citizen science we do at Kilonova Seekers was distracting me from my situation. I never imagined that we would discover such a bright transient, so it was a huge surprise, and we were very happy when we found out. This discovery shows the importance of citizen science, both scientifically and personally. Even from your bed, or on the street with your cell phone, there is the possibility of making a very important discovery.""

Mayahuel Torres-Guerrero, Kilonova Seekers Volunteer based in Mexico said: ""The journey from the discovery of GOTO0650 to the publication of the paper in Astronomy & Astrophysics has been personally rewarding. I had the opportunity to learn how to download data from LCO telescopes and to produce light curves that allowed us to monitor echo outbursts. It was very exciting when GOTO0650 produced an echo outburst on Christmas Day and New Year's Day! It was a great journey for someone who has studied social sciences like me!""

GOTO is a network of telescopes that is principally funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and operated by the University of Warwick at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma, Spain, and Siding Spring Observatory in NSW, Australia, on behalf of a consortium including the University of Warwick, Monash University, Armagh Observatory & Planetarium, the University of Leicester, the University of Sheffield, the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand (NARIT), the University of Turku, the University of Portsmouth, the University of Manchester and the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias (IAC).

Novel research has revealed that adolescent vaping of current delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), and synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) has increased between 2021 and 2023. Also, adolescents are increasingly unsure about the substances they vaped in their e-cigarettes. A new study appearing in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, published by Elsevier, sheds light on this alarming trend and contributes to informing evidence-based public health policies and harm reduction strategies aimed at protecting youth from the long-term consequences of vaping.

Vaping of substances other than nicotine has become increasingly popular among adolescents in the United States. The current study analyzed national trends of adolescent cannabis vaping from the National Youth Tobacco Survey for 2021, 2022, and 2023, comprising a total of 69,899 US middle and high school students (aged 11 to 18 years).

Lead investigator Jack Chung, BApsych (Hons), National Centre for Youth Substance Use Research, and School of Psychology, Faculty of Health and Behavioural Sciences, The University of Queensland, says, ""We found a significant increase in adolescent vaping of THC, CBD, and SCs from 2021 to 2023. THC vaping peaked in 2022 while the use of SCs continued to increase. Adolescents increasingly expressed uncertainty about the substances they were vaping; for example, uncertain respondents answering 'don't know' if they have vaped SCs tripled across the years. Our results also showed that females had a higher prevalence of THC, CBD, and SCs vaping compared to males.""

In 2023, it is estimated that 7.4% (or 2.55 million) of US adolescents were currently vaping THC, while 2.9% (or 999,000) were vaping CBD, and 1.8% (or 620,000) were vaping SCs. Individuals who vape cannabis exhibit more mental health symptoms compared to those who use traditional combustion methods of dry herbs and flowers. SCs are typically lab-synthesized to mimic the effects of naturally occurring cannabinoids and often bind more strongly to brain receptors, leading to more intense and unpredictable health consequences.

Mr. Chung remarks, ""One of the most unexpected findings from our study was the continued rise in adolescent use of SCs. This trend is particularly alarming given that these substances are often accessed through unregulated, illicit markets, where there are no safety standards or quality controls. The growing popularity of SCs among youth raises serious concerns about potential health risks and highlights the urgent need for targeted public health interventions and regulatory oversight. These synthetic cannabinoids products could potentially be deadly, with many adolescents unknowingly vaping these harmful and synthetic substances.""

Co-investigator Gary C.K. Chan, PhD, National Centre for Youth Substance Use Research, Faculty of Health and Behavioural Sciences, The University of Queensland, adds, ""We still know very little about the long-term health effects of cannabis vaping, which makes it even more important to understand what's in your vape.""

This study is one of the first to track national adolescent vaping prevalence of THC, CBD, and SCs independently, given that most recent studies categorized various cannabinoids vaping under the umbrella term ""cannabis vaping,"" despite their vastly different psychological and health effects.

Mr. Chung concludes, ""Experimentation with substance use among teenagers is often driven by peer influence, curiosity, and a desire for social acceptance. This age group may also be increasingly exposed to cannabis-related marketing on social media platforms such as TikTok and YouTube, as well as social media influencers and celebrities. I hope this study will raise awareness of youth cannabis vaping and divert public health resources into better psychoeducation on adolescent vaping, as well as tailored harm reduction interventions to protect our young generations.""

A pioneering study has provided unprecedented insights into the immune response following pig-to-human kidney xenotransplantation.1 

The findings, presented today at the ESOT Congress 2025, mark a significant step forward in overcoming the biggest challenge in xenotransplantation: rejection by the human immune system.

Using cutting-edge spatial molecular imaging, researchers mapped how human immune cells interact with pig kidney tissue in transplanted organs, revealing critical early markers of rejection and potential intervention strategies. The study, led by Dr. Valentin Goutaudier and a collaborative international research team (Paris Institute for Transplantation and Organ Regeneration & NYU Langone Transplant Institute), highlights key molecular mechanisms that could shape the future of xenotransplantation.

One of the most striking discoveries was that human immune cells were found in every part of the pig kidney's filtering system after the transplant. Researchers observed early molecular signs of antibody-mediated rejection as soon as Day 10 and peaking at Day 33, reinforcing previous findings that rejection begins rapidly but progresses over time.2 By tracking these immune responses for up to 61 days, the team identified a crucial window for targeted therapeutic intervention.

""Our study provides the most detailed molecular map to date of how the human immune system engages with a transplanted pig kidney,"" explained Dr. Goutaudier. ""By pinpointing specific immune cell behaviours and gene expressions, we can refine anti-rejection treatments and improve transplant viability.""

The study's innovative approach used a bioinformatic pipeline to distinguish human immune cells from pig structural cells, allowing for precise mapping of immune infiltration patterns. Notably, macrophages and myeloid cells were the most prevalent immune cell types across all time points, further confirming their role as key mediators in xenograft rejection.

When targeted therapeutic interventions were introduced, immune-mediated signs of rejection were successfully weakened. Combined with novel spatial insights into how immune cells interact with pig kidney tissue, this marks a major breakthrough -- paving the way for more refined anti-rejection strategies. These advances come at a pivotal time as the first US-based clinical trials of pig kidney transplantation into living human recipients begin in 2025.

With xenotransplantation poised to address the global organ shortage crisis, these findings bring researchers one step closer to making genetically modified pig kidneys a viable long-term solution. The next phase will focus on optimising anti-rejection treatments, refining genetic modifications in donor pigs, and developing early detection protocols to monitor and manage rejection responses.

""Understanding the specific immune interactions at a molecular level allows us to develop targeted interventions that can prevent rejection before it escalates,"" explained Dr. Goutaudier. ""This research lays the groundwork for safer and more effective pig-to-human transplants in the near future.""

As scientific progress accelerates, researchers remain cautiously optimistic that genetically modified pig kidneys could become a routine transplant option within the next decade. However, regulatory approvals will require consistent demonstration of safety and efficacy in diverse patient populations.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent pollutants that pose major environmental and health concerns. While few environmental bacteria have been reported to bind PFAS, the interaction of PFAS with human-associated gut bacteria is unclear. Here we report the bioaccumulation of PFAS by 38 gut bacterial strains ranging in concentration from nanomolar to 500 μM. Bacteroides uniformis showed notable PFAS accumulation resulting in millimolar intracellular concentrations while retaining growth. In Escherichia coli, bioaccumulation increased in the absence of the TolC efflux pump, indicating active transmembrane transport. Cryogenic focused ion beam secondary-ion mass spectrometry confirmed intracellular localization of the PFAS perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) in E. coli. Proteomic and metabolomic analysis of PFNA-treated cells, and the mutations identified following laboratory evolution, support these findings. Finally, mice colonized with human gut bacteria showed higher PFNA levels in excreted faeces than germ-free controls or those colonized with low-bioaccumulating bacteria. Together, our findings uncover the high PFAS bioaccumulation capacity of gut bacteria.

Environmental contamination by manufactured chemicals has, by some estimates, exceeded the safe planetary boundary1,2. Due to the widespread contamination of water and agricultural systems, a vast number of chemical pollutants make it into food and, hence, into the human body3,4,5,6,7,8. The gut microbiota is particularly susceptible to exposure, and adverse interactions therein could cause systemic effects owing to the critical role of the microbiota in host physiology9,10,11. While the effect of chemical pollutants on bacterial growth is being mapped12, the impact of gut bacteria on chemicals remains largely an open question.

Among the chemicals of greatest concern are per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are often referred to as ‘forever chemicals'. This group of chemicals includes >4,700 compounds13 that are used in a wide range of industrial and consumer products, including firefighting foams, waterproof clothes and nonstick cookware. The widespread use of PFAS owes to their exceptional stability resulting from the strength of C–F bonds14, and surfactant-like properties due to the presence of strong hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups. Yet, these same properties have made PFAS a concern for environmental and human health1,4,6,15,16,17,18,19. The annual health-related cost of PFAS exposure is estimated to be 50–80 billion Euros across Europe20. Studies in Europe and the United States have found high prevalence of PFAS in blood7,21. Legislative actions are therefore planned to control PFAS levels in drinking water and to restrict usage22,23,24,25. However, such efforts are not global and, with long environmental half-lives and no efficient route for their removal, PFAS pose a challenge for human and environmental health. Chemical methods to degrade PFAS have had limited success. Most methods show slow kinetics, require multiple processing steps and focus on non-perfluorinated compounds that have some carbon atoms linked to, for example sulfur26,27. For reducing PFAS in the human body, ion-exchange resins have been shown to be effective but also exhibited side effects28.

Environmental bacteria, such as Pseudomonas sp. strains isolated from PFAS-contaminated sites, have been reported to bioaccumulate a sulfur-containing PFAS (perfluorohexane sulfonate, PFHxS). However, the kinetics was slow and solvent preconditioning was needed to facilitate sequestration29. Furthermore, due to the surfactant-like properties of PFAS, the molecules are believed to interact with and accumulate mainly in the lipid bilayers30,31,32. Similarly, the interaction of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)—an 8-C PFAS with a sulfonic acid functional group—with Lactobacillus strains was noted as ‘bio-binding'33 suggesting binding to the cell surface. Intracellular localization thus remained an open question. As the gut microbiota is a critical interface between exposure and the human body, we investigated how gut bacteria interact with PFAS.

To assess the potential impact of food-borne pollutants on commensal gut bacteria, we started with a community-based screening approach. We assessed the ability of two mixtures (synthetic communities) of gut bacterial strains to sequester pollutant compounds during 4 h of exposure (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Each synthetic community consisted of 10 human gut bacterial strains (Supplementary Table 1). Allocation of strains to the communities was based on similarity in growth rates. In total, 42 common pollutants were selected for testing against these communities based on reported occurrence in food and for representation of different classes including pesticides, food contact materials and industrial chemicals (Supplementary Table 2). A total of 13 pollutants were found to be depleted by more than 20% by one or both synthetic communities (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Of these compounds, 10 were then tested for depletion by 14 individual strains during a 24-h growth period (Extended Data Fig. 1c). These strains are a subset of the 20 strains forming the two synthetic communities and were selected for their prevalence and abundance in a healthy population, and for phylogenetic and metabolic representation34,35 (Supplementary Table 1). In the test with individual strains, 7 pollutants were found to be depleted to more than 20% by at least one of the bacterial strains (Fig. 1a).

Asterisks denote bioaccumulating bacteria (Supplementary Tables 16 and 17).

By comparing the whole culture and supernatant concentrations to compound controls, we were able to distinguish the observed sequestration between bioaccumulation and biotransformation. Bioaccumulation—storage of the pollutant without modification—was defined as compound sequestration to at least 20% from the supernatant but recovery from the whole culture sample, whereas biotransformation was defined as both supernatant and whole culture sample showing more than 20% depletion.

The pollutants bioaccumulated by gut bacteria included perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), which belong to the chemical group of PFAS. Of the tested bacterial species, nine—Bacteroides caccae, Bacteroides clarus, Bacteroides dorei, Bacteroides stercoris, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis, Odoribacter splanchnicus, Parabacteroides distasonis and Parabacteroides merdae—bioaccumulated PFNA and/or PFOA. The degree of bioaccumulation over 24 h for 20 μM (9.3 mg l−1) PFNA exposure varied from 25% (P. distasonis) to 74% (O. splanchnicus) and for 20 μM (8.3 mg l−1) PFOA from 23% (P. merdae) to 58% (O. splanchnicus). Given the widespread presence of PFAS in the environment, we further investigated PFAS bioaccumulation in gut bacteria to understand its underlying mechanisms.

Human gut bacteria are known to harbour extensive intraspecies genomic and functional variability across individuals, including for bioaccumulation of drugs36. To assess the differences in intra- and interspecies bioaccumulation capabilities, we tested 89 microbial strains for PFNA sequestration (Supplementary Table 3). We selected PFNA as it is one of the long-chain PFAS that are excreted via faeces and thus are more likely to be encountered by the gut bacteria than short-chain PFAS that are excreted mainly via urine37. The 89 strains, which include the 14 strains from the above screen, covered all major bacterial phyla (Fig. 1b) and included 66 human gut commensal strains, 10 probiotic strains, and 10 bacterial and 3 yeast strains isolated from kefir. The 66 gut bacterial strains represent, on average, circa 70% of the abundance of the healthy human gut microbiota34. PFNA accumulation showed distinct grouping by phylum, with Bacteroidota showing the highest accumulation (Fig. 1b), and a bimodal distribution that could be divided into two groups using a Gaussian mixture model: low accumulating (51 strains) and high accumulating (38 strains) (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Low-accumulating strains were predominantly Gram positive (43 of 51; 84%), and high-accumulating strains, Gram negative (29 of 38; 76%) (Extended Data Fig. 2b).

Gram-negative bacteria generally have a higher lipid content38, which could be a factor underlying PFAS accumulation31. However, the divide between the bioaccumulation capacity of Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria is not definitive, with notable exceptions including Escherichia coli. To further test the influence of lipid content, we tested three yeast species (Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Candida californica and Kluyveromyces marxianus) that have a high lipid content39 comparable to Gram-negative bacteria. The tested yeasts showed only about 5% sequestration (Fig. 1b), suggesting that additional factors beyond lipid content influence bioaccumulation.

To characterize the kinetics of PFAS bioaccumulation, we selected high-accumulating B. uniformis, a prevalent gut bacterium34,35. PFNA accumulation scaled with cell density, both in non-growing suspension cultures and during bacterial growth (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). We next probed the kinetics of PFNA uptake using stationary-phase cultures or cells suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). In both cases, bioaccumulation occurred within the timescale of sampling (<3 min) (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 2f). Notably, for B. uniformis, no PFNA was released back into the supernatant over the course of 7 days (Fig. 1e).

We next asked whether the fraction of PFAS sequestered was dependent on the exposure concentration. For this, we tested sequestration of PFNA by B. uniformis over a broad range of concentrations (0.01–500 μM (4.64 µg l−1 to 232 mg l−1)). The degree of sequestration remained constant around 50%, both in growing cultures and resting cells (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 2h,i). Furthermore, the degree of bioaccumulation by B. uniformis increased with increasing PFAS chain length, from none for perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA, 7C) to 60% in the case of perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA, 10C) (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 2g). Despite this high degree of bioaccumulation, B. uniformis as well as other abundant gut bacterial strains grew well even at high micromolar concentrations (Fig. 1h). Thus, PFAS bioaccumulation occurs within 3 min without inhibiting bacterial growth up to concentrations orders of magnitude higher than known contamination levels of circa 1 nM (refs. 5,6,15,40).

To investigate how PFAS is bioaccumulated, we first tested whether inactive cell mass (that is, dead, lysed cells) could bioaccumulate PFAS. In resting cell assays, both live and inactivated B. uniformis and O. splanchnicus cells bioaccumulated PFOA, PFNA and PFDA to the same extent (~20%, ~55% and ~85%, respectively). By contrast, live E. coli bioaccumulated much lower levels of PFOA, PFNA and PFDA (~5%, ~25% and ~40%, respectively), while inactivated cells bioaccumulated to a similar degree as B. uniformis and O. splanchnicus (Fig. 2a). This suggests that PFAS bioaccumulation is not solely a passive phenomenon driven by attachment to membrane lipid bilayers. To test this, we measured bioaccumulation in E. coli mutants that lacked one or more genes coding for efflux pump proteins (∆acrA-acrB, ∆tolC) or altered permeability (imp4213) (Fig. 2b). Efflux pumps are a common mechanism used by several bacterial species to reduce intracellular concentration of toxic compounds41,42. We reasoned that E. coli did not bioaccumulate PFNA to the same extent as other tested Gram-negative bacteria because it could, at least to some extent, pump out the PFAS. As gene deletions can exhibit different phenotypes in different strain backgrounds43, we used two E. coli strains, viz. BW25113 and C43 (DE3). Mutants lacking TolC showed circa 1.5-fold increase in PFDA and circa 5-fold increase in PFNA bioaccumulation (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Consistent with the increased bioaccumulation, these mutants showed increased growth inhibition at higher PFAS exposure levels (Extended Data Fig. 3b). These results show that E. coli strains use a TolC-dependent mechanism to limit PFAS bioaccumulation.

Efflux mutants E. coli BW25113 ∆tolC and E. coli C43 (DE3) ∆acrAB-tolC showed a ~1.5-fold increase in PFDA and ~5-fold increase in PFNA bioaccumulation. OD600 = 3.75; exposure concentration = 20 µM (PFNA, 9.3 mg l−1; PFDA, 10.3 mg l−1); two-sided t-test; *P value < 0.05; **P value < 0.01 compared with the corresponding wild type; n = 3 technical replicates (Supplementary Table 19). d, PFNA bioaccumulation by B. uniformis at 0.34 nM (160 ng l−1) exposure.

The bars depict the median concentration based on pellet weight; the error bars show standard error; n = 3 technical replicates shown as circles (Supplementary Table 23).

We next tested whether bacterial cells could bioaccumulate PFAS at very low exposure levels. B. uniformis cells were exposed to 0.34 nM (160 ng l−1) PFNA, a PFAS concentration observed in water samples across Europe and the United States15,40 and below average blood levels6. We validated the applicability of our liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) method for low-concentration samples using the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) method44,45 and using another, independently developed, LC–MS/MS method (Methods). At this low exposure level, B. uniformis bioaccumulated 37% of PFNA into the bacterial pellet, concordant with depletion from the supernatant (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3c). The estimated concentration within the bacterial pellet (wet biomass) was circa 17.7 nM (8,200 ng l−1), a 50-fold increase (Extended Data Fig. 3d). In another experiment with 5 µM (PFHpA, 1.82 mg l−1; PFOA, 2.07 mg l−1; PFNA, 2.32 mg l−1; PFDA, 2.57 mg l−1) exposure, the concentration within the wet pellet of B. uniformis and E. coli BW25113 ∆tolC ranged from circa 13 µM (5 mg l−1) for PFHpA, 50 µM (21 mg l−1) for PFOA, 130 µM (60 mg l−1) for PFNA, to 250 µM (129 mg l−1) for PFDA, that is, 3-, 8-, 25- and 60-fold increase, respectively (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 3e). As these estimates are based on wet pellet weight, intracellular concentrations will be higher. Considering the estimated number of cells per optical density (OD) unit (0.6–2 × 109 cells ml−1 OD600−1 (ref. 38)) and 1 µm3 cell volume38, the enrichment of PFAS in bacterial cells would be 1.2–7 times higher than in the wet pellet. These results show the large capacity of bacterial cells to bioaccumulate and concentrate PFAS from their surrounding environment.

Environmental contamination often contains a mixture of multiple PFAS compounds. We therefore investigated the bioaccumulation capacity of bacteria exposed to a mixture of 14 PFAS (C4–C14, and three sulfonated variants), each at a concentration of 1 mg l−1 (circa 2 µM for PFNA). Many of these compounds, such as PFNA, PFOA, PFOS, PFDA and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA), are among the chemicals of high concern as per the National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The results confirm increasing bioaccumulation with increasing chain length (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 3f). While the E. coli wild type showed minimal bioaccumulation, E. coli ∆tolC and B. uniformis bioaccumulated almost 100% of PFAS with chain length above 10C. The percentage of bioaccumulated PFAS for individual compounds is comparable to a single compound exposure. Thus, at 1 mg l−1 per compound, PFAS bioaccumulation is additive across different molecules with minimal mixture effects.

Intracellular PFNA concentration in B. uniformis at 250 µM (116 mg l−1) exposure level would be circa 5–10 mM (2.3–4.6 g l−1), well above that of most native metabolites46. At these concentrations, the observed degree of bioaccumulation, if considered to be membrane associated only, would imply one molecule of PFNA per two lipid molecules in the cell membrane, which is physiologically improbable. How do cells cope with such high intracellular levels of highly effective surfactants such as PFAS and maintain their growth? To begin to answer this, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to visualize B. uniformis, O. splanchnicus, E. coli wild type and E. coli ∆tolC mutant exposed to PFNA. Consistent with their observed levels of bioaccumulation, all cells except E. coli wild type showed disruption and condensation of cytoplasmic content (Extended Data Fig. 4). Similar morphological features have previously been observed in Clostridium perfringens exposed to lauric acid, which also has surfactant properties47. We quantified cytoplasmic condensation using automated image processing (Methods). B. uniformis and O. splanchnicus showed significantly increased mean pixel intensity and number of condensates upon PFNA and PFDA exposure (Extended Data Fig. 5). However, TEM imaging can show artefacts due to extensive sample processing, including resin embedding. Therefore, to confirm PFNA localization inside the bacterial cells, we performed cryogenic focused ion beam time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (FIB-SIMS) imaging of E. coli ∆tolC cells exposed to 250 µM PFNA. This method circumvents the need to embed the specimen in resin, preserving the cells in a near-native state in vitreous ice. Voxel-by-voxel three-dimensional analysis of the bacterial cell composition uncovered a strong fluorine signal localized inside the bacterial cells, corresponding to intracellular PFNA bioaccumulation (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 6). In total, 2 biological replicates were analysed, comprising 120 E. coli ∆tolC cells exposed to 250 µM PFNA and 44 control cells. All 120 cells exposed to PFNA showed a clear fluorine signal within the bacterial cell, while 43 control cells showed no fluorine signal, and one control cell showed a very low fluorine signal. Furthermore, intracellular PFNA was unevenly distributed with a distinct tendency for aggregation. The intracellular aggregation suggests either interaction of PFAS with cytosolic contents, such as proteins and other macromolecules, or phase separation of PFNA and cytosolic contents within the bacterial cell.

A given area of the sample is imaged by scanning over it repeatedly with a gallium focused ion beam and analysing the chemical composition of the ablated material using FIB-SIMS. Shown is one of 120 cells imaged (additional images in Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Data). a, Secondary electron images (formed by secondary electrons resulting from the FIB scanning) of three different Z-frames of the sample, that is, at three different positions along the z-stack, provide spatial images of the imaged cells. The cells are fully embedded in ice in the first panel (frame 1), the second panel (frame 10) shows the interior of the cell and the last panel (frame 34) features the substrate with the cell almost completely removed. b–e, Top (b) and side (c) views of the three-dimensional stack of SIMS data for a mass-to-charge ratio of 19, corresponding to fluorine (F−), in which the colour scale represents the ion count per extraction. The top view (b) shows the lateral distribution (x–y) of fluorine within the imaged area that is inside the cells. The side view (c), corresponding to an x–z slice through the stack: for the first few frames, there is a fluorine signal from the whole field of view, stemming from the thin ice layer covering the sample (white arrow in c). The fluorine signal away from the cells drops to zero within the first frames. As the cells are initially covered in ice, in the first frames, no highly localized fluorine signal is observed from the cells, as shown by the top view generated from the initial frames (d). Once the ion beam mills into the cell, a fluorine signal from the cell can be seen both in the side view (c, marked by a white rectangle) and in the top view generated from the corresponding slices (e), confirming that the fluorine signal originates from inside the cell.

We next reasoned that if the cells had mechanisms to modulate bioaccumulation and/or to cope with high intracellular levels, resistance to inhibitory PFAS exposure would rapidly evolve under natural selection. We therefore evolved, through serial transfer, B. uniformis, B. thetaiotamicron, P. merdae, C. difficile and E. coli ΔtolC in a medium with 500 μM (182 mg l−1) PFHpA, 500 μM (207 mg l−1) PFOA, 250 μM (116 mg l−1) PFNA or 125 μM (64 mg l−1) PFDA (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Within 20 transfers (20 days)—corresponding to circa 100 generations—P. merdae (PFDA), B. uniformis (PFNA, PFDA) and E. coli ΔtolC (all tested PFAS) showed between 1.3- and 46-fold increase in growth (Extended Data Fig. 7b–d). Notably, the evolved cells retained the bioaccumulation capability of the respective parental strains (Extended Data Fig. 7e). Genome sequencing of evolved B. uniformis populations identified 55 variants linked to PFNA and PFOA exposure (Supplementary Table 4). More than half of the variants are in non-coding regions, suggesting that changes in gene expression contribute to the adaptation of B. uniformis to PFAS.

To characterize how intracellular localization of PFNA affects the molecular physiology of the bioaccumulating cells, we measured their proteomic and metabolic response. The proteome profile of the bioaccumulating E. coli ΔtolC mutant exposed to PFNA showed more changes than the non-accumulating wild type. Most PFNA-impacted proteins are either membrane- or stress response-related (Extended Data Fig. 8). B. uniformis cells exposed to PFNA also showed changes in membrane-related proteins, with the top three being efflux pumps, viz. R9I2M9 efflux transporter resistance–nodulation–cell division (RND) family, R9I2R1 NodT family efflux transporter and R9I2L8 hydrophobe/amphiphile efflux-1 (HAE1) family RND transporter (Fig. 4a). Missense variants of the latter RND transporter (R9I2L8) were also identified in all four PFNA-evolved B. uniformis populations with high (>0.92) allele frequencies. The proteomic and genomic changes together show the involvement of efflux pumps in B. uniformis in cellular interaction with PFAS, as we also found for E. coli. To identify proteins interacting with PFNA, we used thermal proteome profiling (TPP), which allows proteome-wide assessment of structural changes (stabilization or destablization) upon ligand binding48,49. We thus compared E. coli wild type and ΔtolC mutant exposed to PFNA, with the exposure before or after cell lysis, with the latter removing the membrane barrier for PFNA–protein interactions. The bioaccumulating ΔtolC mutant featured 10-fold more PFNA-interacting proteins (Supplementary Table 5). Furthermore, the thermal proteomic responses in the lysate and the live cells are more similar for the mutant than for the wild type, consistent with increased intracellular PFNA bioaccumulation in the ΔtolC mutant (Fig. 4b,c).

a, Proteomics analysis shows proteins that are differentially abundant between B. uniformis treated with 20 µM PFNA and those treated with DMSO. The red and green dots mark proteins with a log2(abundance ratio) > 1 or < −1 (that is, twofold increase or decrease) and a multiple-testing corrected P value of less than 0.05; n = 6 biological replicates (Supplementary Table 24). The circle marks a protein from the RND efflux system (gene ID 962 corresponds to protein R9I2L8), for which nine missense variants within the coding region of the gene were identified in populations evolved under high PFAS concentrations (Supplementary Table 4). P values were calculated using analysis of variance followed by Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple testing. b,c, TPP analysis of E. coli BW25113 wt (wild type; low-PFNA bioaccumulating) (b) and E. coli BW25113 ΔtolC (high-PFNA bioaccumulating) (c). Lysate and live cells incubated with PFNA look more similar for E. coli BW25113 ΔtolC mutant compared with the wild type, supporting increased bioaccumulation in ΔtolC mutants. Each data point represents the summed log2(FC) across all temperatures for a specific protein.

P values were calculated using two-sided t-test and corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method.

The proteomic changes in efflux pump and other membrane-related proteins could be expected to result in altered levels of cellular metabolites. To test this, we used a targeted metabolomics method aimed at broadly conserved metabolites, including amino acids and vitamins. Metabolic changes were observed only for the bioaccumulating strains. B. uniformis, one of the highest bioaccumulators, showed a distinct metabolic response to PFNA exposure (Fig. 4d,e and Extended Data Fig. 9). Metabolites with altered levels include amino acids aspartate, glutamate and glutamine, and kynurenine, a metabolite implicated in the gut–brain axis50,51. Increased cadaverine levels, along with decreased glutamate and glutamine levels, indicate B. uniformis response like that observed in acid stress52,53,54.

To determine whether bacterial PFAS bioaccumulation occurs in an in vivo context, we tested C57BL/6J mice colonized with a community of 20 human gut bacterial strains (Com20)55 (Supplementary Table 6) against germ-free (GF) controls. The animals were administered a one-time oral dose of PFNA (10 mg kg−1 body weight) by gavage. This initial dose was selected based on previous reports indicating it causes no adverse effects in mice56, while still allowing for reliable detection in their faeces. Faecal samples were collected over the following 2 days, and on day 3, colon and small intestine content samples were taken post-mortem (Fig. 5a). Faecal microbiota analysis using 16S rRNA sequencing showed that 17 of the 20 strains colonized the mice and PFNA treatment had no effect on the microbiota composition (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). Colonized mice showed a significantly higher faecal PFNA concentration at all follow-up time points (3 h, P = 0.009, fold change (FC) = 7.9; 1 day, P = 0.001, FC = 2.6; 2 days, P < 0.0001, FC = 2.8; 3 days (colon), P = 0.0004, FC = 3.1; 3 days (small intestine), P = 0.007, FC = 1.9) (Fig. 5b). Next, we tested whether microbial communities containing high- versus low-accumulating species would cause differences in faecal PFNA excretion. GF mice were colonized with a community of either five high- or five low-PFNA-accumulating strains (LC: Akkermansia muciniphila, Collinsella aerofaciens, Enterocloster bolteae, E. coli and Ruminococcus gnavus; HC: Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, Lacrimispora saccharolytica and Phocaeicola vulgatus; Supplementary Table 6). PFNA treatment had no effect on gut microbiota composition (Extended Data Fig. 10c); however, LC-colonized mice showed circa twofold higher colonization compared with HC-colonized mice (Extended Data Fig. 10d,e). HC-colonized mice showed increased faecal excretion of PFNA, normalized by bacterial biomass, on days 1 and 2 (1 day, P = 0.02, FC = 2.4; 2 days, P = 0.009, FC = 3.8) (Fig. 5c). We also carried out a GF versus colonized comparison using a 100× lower PFNA dose (0.1 mg kg−1 body weight PFNA), which showed the same trend of increased excretion for the colonized mice (Extended Data Fig. 10f). Together, the mouse experiments show the contribution of gut bacterial bioaccumulation to faecal PFAS excretion.

Our study reveals the capacity of gut bacteria to bioaccumulate PFAS and has fundamental implications for understanding how PFAS interact with biological systems. We find that bioaccumulation is characterized by high capacity and rapid kinetics. We observe >50-fold enrichment of PFAS within bacterial pellets implying intracellular concentration in the mM range. The internalization of PFAS is supported both by analytical and biological evidence. The latter includes multi-omics analyses, imaging, phylogenetic grouping of bioaccumulators and increased bioaccumulation in the E. coli efflux-pump mutant.

How do the bioaccumulating cells maintain their viability and growth given the surfactant-like properties of PFAS? Cryogenic FIB-SIMS imaging shows that the bioaccumulated molecules aggregate in dense clusters (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Sequestration of PFAS into dense intracellular aggregates appears to minimize interference with vital cellular processes, which may explain the bacterial viability and growth. This is supported by the relatively limited impact of PFAS on the bacterial proteome and metabolome. Yet, these changes may have implications in a community or host context. We observe changes in the expression of membrane proteins, including transporters, and reduced the secretion of amino acids that can reduce cross-feeding opportunities in microbial communities57. Studies in synthetic and ex vivo communities would be needed to investigate how PFAS-induced changes in bacterial physiology impact fellow community members. Redistribution of bioaccumulated PFAS following cell division also remains an open question. FIB-SIMS analysis of growing cells in the presence of PFAS could help elucidate the redistribution of PFAS during cell division.

It is unlikely that bacteria have evolved a specific tolerance mechanism for PFAS given the relatively low fitness cost and complex selection pressures in the gut environment. We postulate that the cellular entry and cytosolic aggregation are consequences of the physicochemical properties of PFAS allowing interaction with non-membrane cellular components. The interaction of PFAS with proteins has been noted in the case of human serum58. Furthermore, studies in aqueous solution have shown self-aggregation of PFAS molecules59. Our conjecture is further supported by the observation that bioaccumulation capacity is phylogenetically segregated and could be genetically modulated in E. coli. Another indication for the key role of PFAS biophysical properties is the positive correlation between chain length and the bioaccumulation (Fig. 1g). In support, a recent study investigating the kinetics of PFAS compounds ingested by a volunteer found that long-chain PFAS bioaccumulate most in the human body37. Together, the biophysical considerations and our data suggest that interactions with transporters and self-aggregation in the cytosol, possibly facilitated by binding to proteins, underlie the observed PFAS condensates inside the bacterial cells. Thus, PFAS bioaccumulation inside the cells is likely to be a consequence of biophysical properties of PFAS rather than an active, regulated, bacterial process.

A key open question is the mechanism of PFAS uptake. Given their surfactant-like properties as well as our data showing active export in E. coli, passive diffusion across the membrane appears unlikely. There is no correlation between PFAS bioaccumulation by gut bacteria and the previously observed drug bioaccumulation data36, indicating distinct import mechanisms. Indeed, higher PFAS bioaccumulation by Gram-negative bacteria is in contrast with their generally lower susceptibility to drug and xenobiotic uptake60,61. The rapid kinetics of PFAS uptake by gut bacteria (timescale of minutes; Extended Data Fig. 2f) contrasts with the slower accumulation reported in environmental bacteria, which occurs over days29. This difference may reflect differences in bacterial membrane composition, surface properties, or transporter properties and expression. Thus, identifying gut bacterial transporters involved in PFAS import through, for example, functional genomic approaches, will be critical to fully elucidate microbial PFAS sequestration.

By uncovering microbial PFAS bioaccumulation in molecular detail, this study provides a framework for investigating microbial contribution to PFAS toxicokinetics. Our gnotobiotic mouse studies show that gut bacteria bioaccumulate PFAS in an in vivo context. However, these experiments were done using a one-time dosage while most populations experience low chronic exposure. Therefore, cohort studies tracking PFAS intake, blood levels, urine and faecal excretion, and microbiota composition over a prolonged period will be an important next step.

Strains were selected to represent prevalent and abundant members of the healthy human gut microbiota34,35 (Supplementary Tables 1 and 3). E. coli mutants were obtained from the Typas laboratory (EMBL Heidelberg, BW25113 wild type, BW25113 ∆tolC, BW25113 imp4213::FRT) and Luisi laboratory (University of Cambridge, C43 (DE3) wild type, C43 (DE3) ∆acrAB-tolC, C43 (DE3) ∆acrAB). All bacterial experiments were performed in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products) filled with 2% hydrogen and 12% carbon dioxide in nitrogen. The chamber was equipped with a palladium catalyst system for oxygen removal, a dehumidifier and a hydrogen sulfide removal system. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in modified Gifu anaerobic medium (mGAM, HyServe, produced by Nissui Pharmaceuticals), prepared according to the instructions from the manufacturer and sterilized by autoclaving. Bacteria for starting cultures were grown for 1 or 2 days (depending on the growth rate) in 10 ml of media in 15-ml plastic tubes, which were inoculated directly from frozen glycerol stocks. Cultures were then diluted 100-fold and incubated again for the same amount of time before the start of the experiments. Unless otherwise specified, the screening plates and tubes with cultivation medium were prepared the day before at 2× compound concentration (2% DMSO) and placed into the chamber overnight to ensure anaerobic conditions for inoculation. Inoculation was performed 1:1 with a bacterial culture, and plates were sealed with AlumaSeal II film (A2350-100EA) to avoid evaporation during incubation.

For all measured compounds, including PFHpA, PFOA, PFNA and PFDA, pure standards were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Merck KGaA). All compounds were dissolved in DMSO, with the exception of NMOR, MDMA and methamphetamine, which came dissolved in methanol, and cocaine and heroin, which came dissolved in acetonitrile. A mix containing 14 PFAS compounds was purchased from Agilent (ITA-70). Labelled standards of PFNA and a mix of 13 PFAS standards were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories and Greyhound Chromatography (CLM-8060-1.2, MPFAC-C-ES).

On the day of the screen, communities were assembled by pooling together second passages of individual strains according to their OD600 values (Supplementary Table 1). Assembled communities were then centrifuged at 25 °C and 3,202 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was resuspended in PBS buffer to create a community with OD600 of 7.5 (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Each well was inoculated 1:1 with the community in PBS to reach a starting OD600 of 3.75 and a compound concentration of 20 µM (1% DMSO). For compound control wells, bacteria-free PBS was added to the respective wells. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, after which they were centrifuged at 21 °C and 3,202 × g for 15 min. The supernatant and compound controls were transferred to fresh 96-well plates and stored at −80 °C until extraction.

Ten compounds selected based on the ‘Community-based screening approach' were tested for sequestration by individual strains (Supplementary Table 7). On the day of the screen, each well was inoculated 1:1 with a second-passage culture to reach a starting OD600 of 0.05 and a compound concentration of 20 µM (1% DMSO) (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1c). For compound control wells, bacteria-free mGAM was added to the respective wells. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, after which they were removed from the anaerobic chamber for sample collection. Whole culture, supernatant and compound control samples were collected and stored at −80 °C until extraction.

Each well was inoculated 1:1 with a culture in PBS to reach the desired starting OD600 of 3.75, unless otherwise specified (Figs. 1b,c,g and 2c, and Extended Data Figs. 2a–d,g,i and 3a). For compound control wells, bacteria-free PBS was added to the respective wells. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, after which they were removed from the anaerobic chamber for sample collection. Whole culture, supernatant and compound control samples were collected and stored at −80 °C until extraction.

On the day of the screen, each well was inoculated 1:1 with a second-passage culture to reach a starting OD600 of 0.05 (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 2h). For compound control wells, bacteria-free mGAM was added to the respective wells. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, after which they were removed from the anaerobic chamber for sample collection. Whole culture, supernatant and compound control samples were collected and stored at −80 °C until extraction.

On the day of the screen, each tube was inoculated 1:1 with a second-passage culture to reach a starting OD600 of 0.05 and a concentration of 20 µM (9.3 mg l−1) PFNA (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2e). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 11 h. Bacteria-free mGAM was added to compound control samples. OD600 was measured every hour, and supernatant, whole culture and compound control samples for PFNA analysis were collected also every hour and stored at −80 °C until extraction.

On the day of the screen, each well was inoculated 1:1 with a culture in PBS to reach a starting OD600 of 3.75 and a concentration of 20 µM (9.3 mg l−1) PFNA (Fig. 1e). Samples were incubated at 37 °C. Bacteria-free PBS was added to compound control samples. Supernatant, pellet, whole culture and compound control samples for PFNA analysis were collected at 0 h, 4 h, 1 day, 2 days, 4 days and 7 days and stored at −80 °C until extraction. The aim of this experiment was to see whether B. uniformis would release PFAS after a prolonged period irrespective of the viability or cell death. Therefore, the viability of the B. uniformis culture was not assessed.

A total of 1.5 ml of stationary second-passage cultures of B. unifomis or pure mGAM was spiked with 15 μl of 2 mM PFNA in DMSO (final concentration 20 µM (9.3 mg l−1) PFNA, 1% DMSO) (Extended Data Fig. 2f). Whole culture, supernatant and compound control samples were collected at 0, 15, 30 and 60 min and stored at −80 °C until extraction.

On the day of the screen, each well was inoculated 1:1 with a live, heat-inactivated or lysed culture in PBS to reach a starting OD600 of 3.75 (Fig. 2a). Second-passage cultures were spun down, and the pellet was resuspended in PBS to an OD600 of 7.5. Each culture was split up into three aliquots: live, heat inactivated and lysed cultures. Live cultures were used as is. Bacteria were heat inactivated at 70 °C for 40 min, and lysed cultures were additionally freeze-thawed three times and sonicated for 3 min. After the respective cultures or bacteria-free PBS was added to the respective wells, the plates were sealed and incubated at 37 °C. After 4 h, whole culture, supernatant and compound control samples were collected and stored at −80 °C until extraction.

Three biological replicates of B. uniformis were grown over the course of 2 days (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). On the day of the experiment, the OD600 of the second-passage cultures was measured, and the equivalent of 2 × 0.5 l of OD600 of 3.75 of each replicate was centrifuged at 3,202 × g for 15 min and the supernatant removed. One pellet per biological replicate was kept as negative control and stored at −80 °C until extraction. The other pellet was resuspended in 0.5 l of 160 ng l−1 PFNA in PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in HDPE bottles (Buerkle 10531712). A total of 3 × 0.5 l of 160 ng l−1 PFNA in PBS without a bacterial pellet was used as the compound control and incubated for the same amount of time. For collection, samples were removed from the anaerobic chamber and centrifuged at 3,202 × g for 15 min. Supernatant and pellet samples were stored separately at −80 °C until extraction.

To determine pellet concentration based on pellet weight across four PFAS compounds (PFHpA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA), a resting cell assay and growth assay were conducted at an exposure concentration of 5 µM in 0.5 ml volume (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 3e). On the day of the screen, each well was inoculated 1:1 with a second-passage culture to reach a starting OD600 of 0.05 in mGAM or a starting OD600 of 3.75 in PBS and a starting concentration of 5 µM of the respective PFAS compound (0.5 ml total volume). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h (mGAM) or 37 °C for 4 h (PBS), after which they were removed from the anaerobic chamber for sample collection. Supernatant was collected for LC–MS analysis, and the pellets were weighed and also collected for LC–MS analysis.

In the resting assay, B. uniformis and E. coli pellets weighed ~8 mg and ~5 mg, respectively, meaning bacterial cells contribute only circa 1–2% to total culture weight and volume.

On the day of the screen, each well was inoculated 1:1 with a culture in PBS to reach a starting OD600 of 3.75 (1 mg l−1 for each PFAS compound: perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), PFHxS, PFHpA, PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA), perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA) and perfluorotetradecanoic acid (PFTA)) (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 3f). Bacteria-free PBS was added to the respective compound control wells. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, after which they were removed from the anaerobic chamber for sample collection. Whole culture, supernatant, pellet and compound control samples were collected and stored at −80 °C until extraction.

A total of 20 µl of a second-passage culture was added to 380 µl of PFAS in mGAM to reach a starting concentration of 20 µM PFNA or PFDA (Extended Data Fig. 7e). Bacteria-free mGAM was added to compound control samples. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, after which whole culture, compound control and supernatant samples were collected for LC–MS analysis.

For all PFAS assays, either mGAM or PBS with 1% DMSO was used. To test whether the solubility of PFAS compounds could affect our assays, we measured the solubility of PFNA and PFDA in mGAM (1% DMSO), PBS (1% DMSO) and 80% methanol (1% DMSO). PFNA was soluble in all conditions up to 500 µM, while PFDA was soluble up to 500 µM in 80% methanol (1% DMSO) and mGAM (1% DMSO), and up to 100 µM in PBS (1% DMSO) (Supplementary Fig. 1a).

For the ‘Community-based screening approach', 70 μl of supernatant was extracted with 140 μl of ice-cold methanol:acetonitrile (1:1) containing the internal standard (IS; 20 µM caffeine, 60 µM ibuprofen) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. For the ‘Single strain-xenobiotic screen', a 50-μl sample was extracted with 200 μl of ice-cold methanol:acetonitrile (1:1) containing the IS (100 µM caffeine, 60 µM ibuprofen) and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min. For other follow-up in vitro assays, a 50-μl sample was extracted with 200 μl of ice-cold methanol:acetonitrile (1:1) containing the IS (60 µM ibuprofen or 20 µM caffeine) and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min. For the PFAS-mix assay, all samples were diluted 1:1 with water and 10 µl of diluted sample was extracted with 90 µl of ice-cold methanol:acetonitrile (1:1) containing the IS (final IS concentration 20 µg l−1 for each IS) at 4 °C for 15 min. Sample plates were then centrifuged at 4 °C and 3,202 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were transferred to 96-well plates for LC–MS analysis. Samples for concentration calibration and bacteria-free compound controls were processed in the same way.

Supernatant and pellet samples were extracted according to the EPA 3rd Draft Method 1633 for analysis of PFAS in aqueous, solid, biosolid and tissue samples44 and the corresponding Agilent application note45 (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). In short, 500 ml of supernatant or compound control samples were weighed and spiked with a known concentration of an IS (1 ml of 50 µg l−1 13C9-PFNA). Pellet samples underwent three freeze–thaw cycles to ensure bacterial lysis. Samples were weighed, resuspended in 20 ml of 0.3% methanolic ammonium hydroxide, spiked with a known concentration of an IS (1 ml of 50 µg l−1 13C9-PFNA) and shaken for 30 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 1,569 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh sample tube. The remaining pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of 0.3% methanolic ammonium hydroxide, shaken for 30 min and centrifuged again. The supernatant was added to the same collection tube, and the pellet underwent the same process again using 10 ml of 0.3% methanolic ammonium hydroxide. To the combined supernatants from each pellet, circa 10 mg carbon (Agilent 5982-4482) was added. Samples were handshaken for up to 5 min and then centrifuged for 10 min at 1,569 × g. The supernatants were collected in a fresh sample tube. Agilent solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges (Agilent 5610-2150) were loaded with silanized glass wool (Agilent 8500-1572) fitted with large volume adaptors (Agilent 12131012 and 12131001) and conditioned with 15 ml of 1% methanolic ammonium hydroxide followed by 5 ml of 0.3 M formic acid. Samples were then loaded into SPE cartridges and set to a low flow rate of circa 5 ml min−1, followed by a rinse with 10 ml reagent water and 5 ml of 1:1 0.1 M aqueous formic acid:methanol, before being dried under the vacuum. Sample bottles were rinsed and eluted with 5 ml of 1% methanolic ammonium hydroxide. Then, 25 µl of acetic acid was added to each sample and each sample was vortexed. To each supernatant and compound control eluate, 10 mg carbon (Agilent 5982-4482) was added, and samples were handshaken for up to 5 min and then centrifuged for 10 min at 1,569 × g. All samples were filtered through a nylon syringe filter (Agilent 9301-6476, 5190-5092) into a collection tube for LC–MS analysis.

Frozen faecal samples were weighed out into tubes with beads, and 250 μl extraction buffer (methanol + 0.05 KOH + 15 μM caffeine (Fig. 5b) or 0.01 mg l−1 M9PFNA (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 10f)) was added. Tubes were then homogenized at 1,500 rpm (SPEX SamplePrep LLC) for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 16,900 × g and 4 °C for 5 min. Then, 20 μl supernatant was added to 80 μl water + 0.1% formic acid, and the mixture was vortexed, incubated at 4 °C for 15 min and centrifuged at 16,900 × g and 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to LC–MS vials with inserts. Samples for concentration calibration were processed in the same way.

LC–MS analysis was performed on an Agilent 1290 Infinity II LC system coupled with an Agilent 6546 LC/Q-TOF. The quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) MS scan was operated in positive or negative MS mode using four different collision energies (0 V, 10 V, 20 V, 40 V) (30–1,500 m/z), depending on the xenobiotic targeted for measurement (Supplementary Table 2). The source parameters were as follows: gas temperature, 200 °C; drying gas, 9 l min−1; nebulizer, 20 psi; sheath gas temperature, 400 °C, sheath gas flow, 12 l min−1; VCap, 3,000 V; nozzle voltage, 0 V; fragmentor, 110 V; skimmer, 45 V; and Oct RF Vpp, 750 V. The online mass calibration was performed using a reference solution (positive: 121.05 and 922.01 m/z; negative: 112.99 and 1033.99 m/z). The compounds were identified based on their retention time, accurate mass and fragmentation patterns. For all measured compounds, pure standards were used for method development, compound identification and calibration.

Five different LC methods were applied.

The source parameters were as follows: gas temperature, 230 °C; gas flow, 6 l min−1; nebulizer, 20 psi; sheath gas temperature, 355 °C; sheath gas flow, 10 l min−1; VCap, 3,500 V (positive) or 2,500 V (negative); and nozzle voltage, 2,000 V (positive) or 0 V (negative). Pure standards (Agilent ITA-70) and labelled standards (Wellington Laboratories MPFAC-C-ES) were used for method development, compound identification and calibration (Supplementary Fig. 1c).

Analysis was performed (Imperial College London; Extended Data Fig. 3c) using a Shimdazu Nexera X2 LC-system coupled to an LCMS-8060 triple quadrupole system with an electrospray ionization source operated in negative ionization mode (Shimadzu). Separations were performed at 0.5 ml min−1 using a Force C18 column (50 × 2.1 mm, 3 µm, Thames Restek) fitted with a matching guard column (Force C18, 5 × 2.1 mm, 5 µm), and a delay column (50 × 2.1 mm, 5 µm, Thames Restek) was installed between the mobile phase mixer and the autosampler. Sample order was randomized throughout the batch with an injection volume of 10 µl, and the autosampler was held at 4 °C for the entire analysis. The elution programme is as follows: an initial hold at 30% mobile phase B (MPB, MeOH; MPA—10 mM ammonium acetate (aq)) for 0.51 min, then an increase to 60% MPB by 1.5 min, followed by another increase to 90% MPB at 5 min, a hold at 95% MPB from 6 to 7 min, followed by a 3-min re-equilibration period at initial conditions. A 90:10 (MeOH:H2O) needle wash was used to rinse the outside of the needle before and after sample aspiration. Three transitions were monitored for both PFNA (463.05 > 419.00, 463.05 > 219.25 and 463.05 > 169.30) and M9PFNA (472.00 > 427.15, 472.00 > 223.10 and 472.00 > 172.25). Refer to Supplementary Table 30 for the voltages and collision energies (optimized) used in each of the quadruples for each transition of PFNA and M9PFNA. Analysis of all extracts was accompanied by quality control samples (0, 1 and 10 µg l−1 in methanol, 1% ammonium hydroxide, 0.5% acetic acid) and mobile phase blanks to account for instrumental contamination and to mitigate carryover.

A deep-well plate containing 1,180 µl PFNA in mGAM was inoculated with 10 µl second-passage culture to create a final concentration of 20 µM PFNA (Fig. 4d,e and Extended Data Fig. 9). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, after which 1 ml bacterial culture was transferred to a fresh tube and centrifuged at 4 °C and 3,202 × g for 3 min. The supernatant and pellet were collected and kept at −80 °C until extraction. Pellet samples and 100 µl of supernatant per sample were extracted with 800 µl of 1:1 methanol:water and vortexed; 200 µl chloroform was added to each sample and samples were incubated at −20 °C for 1 h for protein precipitation. Samples were then centrifuged at 4 °C and 3,202 × g for 2 min, and the water phase was transferred to LC–MS vials for analysis.

Amino acids and vitamins were quantified using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry as described previously62. On an Agilent 1290 Infinity II system, analytes were separated using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography with a Waters Acquity BEH Amide 1.7 µm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm column operated at 35 °C. A binary buffer system of buffer A (50% acetonitrile, 10 mM ammonium formate, 0.176% formic acid) and buffer B (95:5:5 acetonitrile:methanol:water, 10 mM ammonium formate, 0.176% formic acid) was used at a constant flow rate of 0.9 ml min−1 and the following gradient: 0 min: 85% B, 0.7 min: 85% B, 2.55 min: 5% B, 2.9 min: 5% B, 2.91 min: 85% B and 3.5 min: stop time. The Agilent triple quadrupole 6470 instrument with JetStream ion source (AJS-ESI) was used in dMRM mode with a cycle time of 320 ms. The source parameters were as follows: gas temperature, 325 °C; gas flow, 10 l min−1; nebulizer, 40 psi; sheath gas temperature, 350 °C; sheath gas flow, 11 l min−1; capillary (positive), 3,500 V; capillary (negative), 3,500 V; nozzle voltage (positive), 1,000 V; and nozzle voltage (negative), 1,000 V. The injection volume was 0.25 µl. A serially diluted external calibration standard, blanks and a pooled quality control sample were injected at regular intervals between samples. Data were analysed using MassHunter Workstation Quantitative Analysis for QQQ v10.1.

The Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis 10.0 software was used to qualify the selected xenobiotic standards. Total ion chromatogram (TIC), extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) and EIC-fragment graphs were extracted for each compound. The Agilent MassHunter TOF Quantitative Analysis (version 10.1) or Agilent MassHunter QQQ Quantitative Analysis software (version 10.1) was used to quantify the xenobiotic compounds in each sample.

Calibration curves based on pure compound standards were used to estimate the concentrations of target compounds. Raw response values were used for concentration calculations for most analysis. Exceptions were the ‘Single strain-xenobiotic screen', data represented in Extended Data Fig. 2i, low concentration experiment per EPA Draft Method 1633, PFAS-mix experiment and mouse faecal analysis, in which the ratio of the compound response to internal standard response was used. Data analysis was performed in RStudio Version 1.3.1093. The median of each sample group was compared with the median of the compound controls, and an appropriate reduction of more than 20% was chosen as cut-off, to ensure relevant reduction compared with the compound control distribution. In addition, statistical comparison was performed using t-test (two sided), and P values were false discovery rate (FDR) corrected (when a t-test was performed, the adjusted P values are given in the respective figures). An adjusted P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.

In the ‘Single strain-xenobiotic screen', bioaccumulation was defined as compound sequestration to at least 20% from the supernatant but not from the whole culture sample, whereas biodegradation was defined as both supernatant and whole culture sample showing more than 20% compound sequestration.

Concentration in samples extracted according to EPA Draft Method 1633 was calculated based on the ratio with the labelled IS, which was spiked into the sample at a known concentration of 100 ng l−1.

Plates (Corning 3795) containing 50 μl mGAM with 2× PFAS (2% DMSO) concentration were prepared the evening before and placed into the anaerobic chamber overnight to ensure anaerobic conditions for inoculation (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 3b). On the day of the screen, each well was inoculated with 50 μl of a second-passage culture to reach a starting OD600 of 0.05. The plates were sealed with a gas-permeable membrane (Breath-Easy, Merck, catalogue number Z380059), which was additionally pierced with a syringe to prevent gas build-up. The plates were stacked without lids and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in a stacker–incubator system (Biostack 4, Agilent BioTek) connected to a plate reader (Epoch 2, Agilent BioTek) to record the OD600 (ref. 63).

Growth curve analysis was performed in RStudio version 1.3.1093. First, for each growth curve, the minimum OD value was set to 0. Then, the raw area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each well using ‘bayestestR' package and area_under_curve() function. Further processing of growth curves was done by plate. AUC values were normalized by median AUC of all control wells (DMSO controls) on the respective plate to determine percentage growth inhibition.

On the day of the experiment, each tube containing 2× concentration of PFAS was inoculated 1:1 with a second-passage culture to reach a starting OD600 of 0.05 (Extended Data Fig. 4). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, after which bacterial cultures were spun down and the supernatant was removed. The bacteria were then fixed with a half Karnovsky fixative as 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4 with NaOH) for a few hours at room temperature. For conventional TEM64, the post-fixation was performed with a mixture of 1% osmium tetroxide and 1% potassium ferrocyanide in the cacodylate buffer. The bloc was stained with 5% aqueous uranyl acetate solution. The dehydration with a series of ethanol and the resin infiltration were completed for the plastic embedding in TAAB epoxy resin. After the polymerization at 65 °C for a few days, the ultrathin sections (∼60 nm) were cut using an ultramicrotome (Leica EM UCT/UC7/Artos-3D), mounted on formvar-carbon films on EM copper grids and stained with lead citrate. The bacterial ultrastructure was observed using a FEI Talos F200C 200 kV transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a Ceta-16M CMOS-based camera (4k × 4k pixels under a 16-bit dynamic range) and a JEM-1400 Flash TMP (JEOL) with TVIPS TemCam-XF416 CMOS (Tietz Video and Image Processing Systems) as described previously65.

Electron microscopy images were converted to an 8-bit format using FIJI66 (Extended Data Fig. 5). Only images with the same magnification level were analysed. The segmentation and quantification of these images were performed using CellProfiler 4.2.6 (Stirling, DR, BMC Bioinformatics, 202167). Individual cells were segmented as primary objects based on their intensity and size after the application of a Gaussian blur filter. Within each cell, condensates were also segmented based on intensity and size. Mean pixel intensity and number of condensates were quantified for each cell and their corresponding condensates, and the results were exported as CSV files. Cells touching the edges of the images were not considered for this quantification. Images showing the segmented areas were saved as TIFF files. All sectioned cells and aggregates were manually checked, and wrong sectioned cells and cells that were identified in duplicate were excluded from further analysis.

Cryogenic FIB-SIMS imaging68 was performed on a focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (Zeiss Crossbeam 550) equipped with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Tofwerk; Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 6). During FIB-SIMS imaging, the sample is scanned by a gallium focused ion beam, which ablates material at each pixel. The secondary ions resulting from the interaction of the ion beam and sample are extracted at each scanning position and are analysed by time-of-flight secondary electron mass spectrometry. The method hence allows a pixel-by-pixel visualization of the sample's chemical composition, in which the colour scale represents the ion count. The simultaneous detection of secondary electrons yields spatial images of the sample (FIB images, Fig. 3a). As material is continuously removed during the imaging process, repeated scanning of a given sample area provides three-dimensional information regarding both spatial features and chemical composition of the sample, thus creating a volume with a mass spectrum for each voxel. This not only allows this method to show the lateral localization of elements of interest, but also provides depth information: each two-dimensional image resulting from a full scan of the observed area can be considered as a slice of the sample (frame) within a Z-stack (Fig. 3) while the distribution along the Z-axis can be extracted as X–Z slices. To retain a near-native state of the sample, E. coli ∆tolC cells were plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher) after applying 2.5 µl of sample to a cryo-EM grid (Quantifoil Cu/Rh R3.5/1, UltrAuFoil R 1.2/1.3) as described previously69.

A deep-well plate containing 1,180 µl PFNA in mGAM was inoculated with 10 µl second-passage culture to create a final concentration of 20 µM PFNA (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 8). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, after which bacterial cultures were spun down and the supernatant was removed.

The bacterial cell pellets were lysed in 100 mM triethyl ammonium bicarbonate containing 0.1% RapiGest surfactant by sonication on ice (50J ×5, 30% amplitude) after denaturing by two rounds of incubation at 80 °C for 10 min with intermittent cooling. The solubilized protein content was estimated using Pierce 660 nm assay as per the manufacturer's instructions. Then, 50 µg of protein from each sample was reduced with 4 mM dithiothreitol, alkylated with 14 mM iodoacetamide and further digested with trypsin at 1:50 protease to protein ratio for 16 h at 37 °C. The peptide content was estimated at 1:10 dilution using Pierce quantitative colorimetric assay as per the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of peptides from respective bacterial samples were labelled with TMT in a randomized fashion to ensure that the reporter ion isotopic distribution is spread across the replicates following the manufacturer's guidelines (Thermo Fisher Scientific). An equal volume of the respective tandem mass tag (TMT)-labelled peptides was pooled together and desalted to remove unbound labels. The desalted peptides were further subjected to fractionation based on their reverse-phase chromatographic properties under basic pH using an analytical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The 12 concatenated fractions collected were vacuum dried, resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing 3% acetonitrile and taken for LC–MS/MS analysis.

LC–MS/MS analysis was carried out in RTS-SPS-MS3 mode for TMT reporter ion quantification. An equal amount of predetermined sample load from each of the 12 fractions was analysed using an Orbitrap Eclipse mass spectrometer with an Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano chromatography system coupled in-line. The peptides were loaded onto the trapping column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PepMap100, C18, 300 μm × 5 mm), using partial loop injection, washed for 3 min at a flow rate of 15 μl min−1 with 0.1% formic acid (FA). The peptides were resolved on an analytical column (Easy-Spray C18 75 µm × 500 mm; 2 µm particle size) at a flow rate of 300 nl min−1 using a gradient in which the percentage of B is raised from 3–25 over 140 min and then to 40% for an additional 13 min. The column was washed in 90% B for 12 min and re-equilibrated in 3% B for 15 min before next injection. Subsequently, 0.1% FA in water was used as mobile phase A and 0.1% FA in 80% acetonitrile was used as mobile phase B. Data were acquired using three field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) compensation voltages (−45 V, −60 V and −75 V). For each FAIMS experiment with a maximum cycle time of 2 s, mass spectrum acquisition was carried out in RTS-SPS-MS3 mode. In this mode, full-scan MS was acquired in the mass range of 415–1,500 m/z at 120,000 resolution with a maximum ion injection time of 30 ms (AGC target 2e5 ions). Precursors selected for MS/MS were isolated using an isolation width of 0.7 m/z and fragmented by HCD using collision energy of 32%. An MS/MS scan was performed on the ion trap at a turbo scan rate (AGC 5e4 ions) with a maximum ion injection time of 22 ms. To avoid repeated selection of peptides for MS/MS, the programme used a 40-s dynamic exclusion window. Real-time search parameters were set as follows using respective fasta databases: Uniprot B. uniformis database, UP000014212 (downloaded on 21 June 2023, contains 3,957 sequences); Uniprot O. splanchnicus database, UP000006657 (downloaded on 21 June 2023, contains 3,479 sequences); and Uniprot E. coli K12 database, UP000000625 (downloaded on 21 June 2023, contains 4,362 sequences). Protease: trypsin, static modifications: cysteine carbamidomethylation (+57.0215) and TMT (+229.163) or TMTPro (+304.207) on lysine and N-terminus, variable modification: methionine oxidation (+15.99491). One missed cleavage was allowed, and FDR filtering was enabled. Only 5 peptides per protein were allowed per basic reverse-phase fraction (using the close-out option), and the maximum search time for RTS was set to 35 ms. Ten of the most abundant peptide fragments were selected for SPS-MS3, and the MS3 spectrum was acquired at 120,000 resolution on the mass range 100–500 m/z with an AGC target of 500% and a maximum injection time of 246 ms.

Data were processed using Proteome Discoverer v3.0 using the protein databases mentioned above. The spectrum identification was performed with the following parameters: MS accuracy, 10 ppm; MS/MS accuracy, 0.6 Da for spectra acquired in an ion trap mass analyser; missed cleavage, up to 2; fixed modifications, carbamidomethylation of cysteine and TMT/TMTpro on lysine and on peptide N-terminus; and variable modifications, oxidation of methionine. An intensity-based rescoring of PSMs identified in SequestHT node was performed by Inferys before false discovery rate estimation using Percolator. Only rank 1 peptide identifications with high confidence (FDR < 1%) were accepted for identification and quantification reporting. Quantification was carried out on the S/N values of reporter ions for the identified peptides that are unique to the proteins. The protein abundance was enumerated by summing the abundances of the connected peptide groups matching to respective proteins. Data normalization was carried out using the TMT channel with the highest total protein abundance as the reference channel. The normalized abundance values are reported for comparison across datasets.

TPP was performed as previously described36,70 (Fig. 4b,c). In brief, cells were grown anaerobically at 37 °C for 48 h. Cells were then washed twice with anaerobic PBS. For the live cell experiments, cells were treated with eight different concentrations of anaerobic PFNA (twofold dilutions starting at 10 µM including DMSO control) for 30 min at 37 °C in the anaerobic chamber. Aliquots of treated cells were then incubated in 10 different temperatures for 3 min. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 µg ml−1 lysozyme, 1 mM MgCl2, complete protease inhibitors, 0.25 U µl−1 benzonase in PBS) with 0.8% NP-40 and lysed with 5 freeze–thaw cycles. Aggregates were then removed and soluble proteins were prepared for mass spectrometry. For the lysate experiments, cells were lysed as above but without the presence of NP-40. NP-40 was added after the heat treatment before the aggregate removal.

Proteins were digested as previously described71,72. Eluted peptides were labelled with TMT16plex, pooled (all treatments of each two adjacent temperatures per experiment) and pre-fractionated into six fractions under high-pH conditions. Samples were then analysed with liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, as previously described70.

All raw files were converted to mzmL format using MSConvert from Proteowizard, using peak picking from the vendor algorithm. Files were then searched using MSFragger v3.7 (ref. 73) in Fragpipe v19.0 against the Uniprot proteome UP000000625 containing common contaminants and reversed sequences.

Data analysis was performed using R. Only proteins with at least two identified peptides were kept for the analysis, and outlier conditions were removed altogether. For the correlation analysis, per experiment, protein intensities across all concentrations within each temperature were normalized using variance stabilization normalization74 and the cumulative fold change across temperatures and concentrations per protein was calculated. For the hit calling, the data were preprocessed using the TPP package49 and analysed using the TPP2D package75 with an alpha of 0.1.

B. uniformis, B. thetaiotamicron, O. splanchnicus, P. merdae and E. coli BW25113 ∆tolC were evolved for 20 days in 500 μM PFHpA, 500 μM PFOA, 250 μM PFNA and 125 μM PFDA (Extended Data Fig. 7). DMSO was used as a control. For each PFAS compound 4 and for the DMSO controls 8 replicate lineages were evolved in parallel. Subsequently, 2-ml deep-well stock plates containing a 100× stock of each PFAS in DMSO were prepared before the experiment and stored at −80 °C until use. On day 0, each well was inoculated with a second-passage culture to reach a starting OD600 of 0.05. On each of the following days, 50 μl of grown culture was transferred to a fresh compound plate containing PFAS–DMSO in mGAM. Every 5 days, the growth of the strains in the presence of PFAS was measured by transferring 100 μl of starting culture to a clear-bottom plate, measuring and analysing it as described in the section ‘PFAS–Bacteria Growth Screens'. On day 20, glycerol stocks were prepared from each lineage and stored at −80 °C.

Genomic DNA of B. uniformis after evolving in PFNA, PFOA and DMSO control was extracted with the QIAamp PowerFecal Pro DNA kit (Qiagen; 51804) and quantified using Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kits (Q33230). On average, 74.38 ng µl−1 of DNA was obtained and sequenced by Illumina NovaSeq 6000 with a library insert size of 350 bp, resulting in 6.50 to 9.95 million paired reads (mean = 8.68 million) with a length of 150 bp. Sequencing reads were then filtered with fastp (v 0.32.2)76 using default parameters. We called the variants in evolved strains using snippy pipeline (https://github.com/tseemann/snippy). Filtered reads from PFNA-, PFOA- and DMSO-evolved populations were aligned to the reference genome with BWA, and variants were called by freebayes77 using parameters ‘–mincov 10–basequal 30–fbopt '-C 3 -p 1 -F 0.01'' defined through snippy. Afterwards, those variants appearing in both PFNA–PFOA and DMSO control samples were removed.

Animal experiments were approved by the local authorities (Regierungspräsidium Tübingen, H 02/20 G) (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 10). GF C57BL/6J mice were bred in house (Gnotobiotic Mouse Facility). Mice were housed under GF conditions in flexible film isolators (Zoonlab) and transferred to the Isocage P system (Tecniplast) to perform the experiments. The housing conditions were 12:12-h light–dark cycles; temperature, 22 °C ± 2 °C; and humidity, 50–56%. Mice were supplied with autoclaved drinking water and γ-irradiated maintenance chow for mice (Altromin) ad libitum. Female and male mice between 5 and 6 weeks old were randomly assigned to experimental groups. Mice were kept in groups of three per cage during the experiment. All animals were scored daily for their health status.

The Com20 and high- and low-accumulating communities (Supplementary Table 6) were prepared under anaerobic conditions (Coy Laboratory Products; 2% H2, 12% CO2 and the remainder was N2). Consumables, glassware and media were pre-reduced at least 2 days before inoculation of bacteria. Each strain was grown in monoculture overnight in 5 ml of their respective growth medium at 37 °C. The next day, bacteria were subcultured (1:100) in 5 ml fresh medium and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C, except Eggerthella lenta, which was grown for 2 days. OD at 578 nm was determined, and bacteria were mixed together in equal ratios to a total OD of 0.5 in a final volume of 10 ml. After 2.5 ml of 50% glycerol (with a few crystals of palladium black (Sigma-Aldrich)) was added, 200-µl aliquots were prepared in glass vials (2 ml; Supelco, ref. 29056-U) and directly frozen at −80 °C. Frozen vials were used within 3 months.

Inoculation of GF mice was performed according to a previous study55. In short, cages were transferred to an ISOcage Biosafety Station (IBS) (Tecniplast) through a 2% Virkon S disinfectant solution (Lanxess) dipping bath. Glycerol stocks of the frozen communities (one per mouse) were kept on dry ice before being thawed during transfer into the IBS. Mixtures were used directly after thawing with a minimal exposure time to oxygen of maximum 3 min. Mice were inoculated by oral gavage (50 µl) and inoculation was repeated after 48 h using the same protocol. The GF control group was left untreated. The IBS was sterilized with 3% perchloracetic acid (Wofasteril, Kesla Hygiene AG).

Mice were orally gavaged with PFNA (10 mg kg−1 or 0.1 mg kg−1 in 25% DMSO) in a volume of 50 µl 10 days after the second inoculation with Com20, or high- or low-accumulating communities. The human equivalent dose of 0.1 mg kg−1 is 8.1 µg kg−1 (ref. 78), which amounts to 486 µg PFNA for a 60-kg person. Given the EU drinking water limit for individual PFAS at 0.1 µg l−1 and an estimated daily water intake of 4 l, this dose corresponds to approximately 3 years of exposure.

Fresh faecal samples were collected before treatment and 3 h, 1 day and 2 days after treatment in sterile 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and immediately frozen at −80 °C. On day 3 after treatment, mice were euthanized using CO2 and cervical dislocation and dissected, and intestinal contents were taken from the colon and the small intestine.

DNA extraction from faecal samples was performed in house using a MagMAX Microbiome Ultra Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit in bead tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A42358) and the KingFisher Flex (MAN0018071) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, DNA integrity was verified using agarose gel electrophoresis and the DNA concentration was determined using a Qubit dsDNA BR assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q32853) in combination with the Varioskan LUX plate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

A two-step PCR protocol was used to prepare 16S amplicons. A single amplicon was generated using V4 primer pairs (515F/806R) for the first mouse experiment (10 mg kg−1 PFNA, Com20 versus GF) and V4 and V5 primer pairs (515F/926R) for the second mouse experiment (10 mg kg−1 PFNA, high- versus low-accumulating community). In the first step PCR, primers with overhang adapter sequences were added; afterwards, in the second PCR, Illumina sequencing adaptors and dual‐index barcodes were added to the amplicon target for pooling. Pooled samples are sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument using a 2 × 250 PE protocol at the Genomics Core Facility (EMBL Heidelberg).

In total, 1,086,628 pair-end reads for the first mouse experiment and 6,531,459 for the second mouse experiment (an average of 10,061 pairs per sample in the first experiment and 56,306 pairs per sample in the second experiment) with 250 bp were generated. Raw sequencing reads were truncated and filtered using the DADA2 pipeline (v1.26.0)79 with the following parameters: ‘truncLen=c(230,210), maxN=0, maxEE=c(2,2), truncQ=2, rm.phix=TRUE'. Afterwards, error rates were learned from filtered reads, and corrected reads were merged as ASVs. A self-defined reference was used for alignments of ASVs and calculation of relative abundances.

All data analysis was performed using open-source packages accessed from RStudio (version 1.3.1093). The Agilent MassHunter TOF Quantitative Analysis (version 10.1) or Agilent MassHunter QQQ Quantitative Analysis software (version 10.1) was used to quantify the xenobiotic compounds in each sample. All t-tests are two sided. All P values are FDR corrected. Biological replicates refer to different inoculation cultures, while technical replicates refer to experiments starting with the same inoculation culture. None of the data points correspond to repeated measurements of the same sample. Fold changes refer to the ratio of medians.

No randomization was used in microbiological experiments. In animal experiments, female and male mice were housed in separate cages, and subsequently, cages were randomly assigned to experimental groups. Each experimental group included mice from both sexes.

Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes. Sample sizes were chosen on previous experience and according to those reported in previous publications36,56.

During cryogenic FIB-SIMS imaging, the vitrified sample is scanned by a Gallium focused ion beam (FIB) and time-of-flight secondary electron mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) is performed on the secondary ions created by the interaction of ion beam and sample at each scanning position. Thus, the chemical composition of the sample can be visualised pixel-by-pixel. a-c. E. coli ∆tolC exposed to 250 µM PFNA. d-f. E. coli ∆tolC exposed to DMSO control. For both cases, a spatial image of a cell resulting from the secondary electrons created during FIB imaging is shown on the left (a,d). Please note that because the specimens were frozen on a holey cryo-EM grid, round holes in the film are additionally observed, in addition to the elongated cells. On the right (b,c,e,f), ToF-SIMS images of the same cell are shown for mass-to-charge ratios 19 and 63, corresponding to F− and PO2−, respectively. The colour bars indicate ion count, that is, regions shown in red are those where the most ions of the particular species were detected. F− signal indicates the presence of PFNA, PO2− was chosen as a comparison as it occurs in most bacterial cells and hence is a reliable marker for cells in negative SIMS imaging mode. In E. coli ∆tolC cells exposed to PFNA, a strong F− signal is observed within the cell (b), which is not the case for the DMSO treated cells (e), in which a faint background signal can only be observed when adjusting the colour scale by several orders of magnitude.

a. Gut microbiota composition of mice colonised with 20 human gut bacterial strains (Com20) and exposed to 10 mg/kg body weight by oral gavage on day 0. 17 out of 20 gut bacteria colonised the mice with 7 strains making up 90% of bacterial composition (P. vulgatus, R. gnavus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, A. rectalis, Veillonella parvula, Dorea formicigenerans). The composition in the small intestine differed from that in the feces and colon, with the dominating species being R. gnavus and V. parvula (Supplementary Table 42). b. In the colon and fecal samples 70% of bacteria were classified as high-PFNA accumulating strains, while in the small intestine only 20% of bacteria were classified as high-PFNA accumulating (Supplementary Table 43). c. Gut microbiota composition of mice colonised with a community of five high-PFNA accumulating strains (HC) and five low-PFNA accumulating strains (LC) exposed to 10 mg/kg body weight by oral gavage on day 0. All gut bacteria colonised the mice, but A. muciniphila was present in both HC and LC colonised mice (Supplementary Table 44). d. LC (low-PFNA accumulating community) colonised mice showed higher DNA yields after DNA extraction compared to HC (high-PFNA accumulating community) colonised mice (1.96-fold change, p-value = 0.002), indicating higher bacterial content in LC colonised mice; two-sided t-test; Boxplot: centre = 50th percentile, bounds of box = 25th and 75th percentile, lower/upper whisker = lower/upper hinge −/+ 1.5 * inter quartile range; n = 54 samples per group (Supplementary Table 28). e.

Two-sided t-test; Boxplot: centre = 50th percentile, bounds of box = 25th and 75th percentile, lower/upper whisker = lower/upper hinge −/+ 1.5 * inter quartile range; Subset of 76 samples (Supplementary Table 45). f. Mice colonised with a community of 20 human gut bacterial strains (Com20) show higher PFNA excretion after 0.1 mg/kg body weight PFNA exposure compared to germfree (GF) controls; Boxplot: centre = 50th percentile, bounds of box = 25th and 75th percentile, lower/upper whisker = lower/upper hinge −/+ 1.5 * inter quartile range; two-sided t-test; p-values are FDR corrected; n = 6 mice per group; y-axes are on log10 scale (Supplementary Table 46).

Several chemotherapeutic agents act by increasing DNA damage in cancer cells, triggering cell death. However, there is limited understanding of the extent and long-term consequences of collateral DNA damage in normal tissues. To investigate the impact of chemotherapy on mutation burdens and the cell population structure of normal tissue, we sequenced blood cell genomes from 23 individuals aged 3–80 years who were treated with a range of chemotherapy regimens. Substantial additional somatic mutation loads with characteristic mutational signatures were imposed by some chemotherapeutic agents, but the effects were dependent on the drug and blood cell types. Chemotherapy induced premature changes in the cell population structure of normal blood, similar to those caused by normal aging. The results show the long-term biological consequences of cytotoxic agents to which a substantial fraction of the population is exposed as part of disease management, raising mechanistic questions and highlighting opportunities for the mitigation of adverse effects.

Over the course of a lifetime, one in two people develops cancer. A long-standing approach to cancer treatment is systemic administration of a diverse group of cytotoxic chemicals, often termed ‘chemotherapy', which includes alkylating agents, platinum compounds, antimetabolites, topoisomerase inhibitors, vinca alkaloids and cytotoxic antibiotics1. Some of these agents exert their therapeutic effects by causing damage to DNA that, in turn, triggers the death of malignant cells2. Approximately 30% of individuals with cancer, and thus approximately 10% of the whole population in developed countries, are exposed to chemotherapy at some point in their lifetime (www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics-for-the-uk), providing considerable exposure of normal tissues to the actions of these drugs.

Chemotherapy can have long-term side effects on normal tissues. It confers an increased risk of cancers of the blood3,4,5,6, lung, bladder and colon7,8 and is sometimes toxic to the kidney, blood, heart, brain, gastrointestinal tract, peripheral nervous system and gonads, engendering long-term deterioration in organ function9,10,11,12,13,14. There is limited understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying these sequelae. It is plausible that some are related to the consequences of DNA damage and thus could be elucidated through the genome sequences of normal tissues, which may reveal changes in somatic mutation burdens or clonal composition immediately or decades following chemotherapy.

Sequencing of cancers arising after chemotherapy treatment has revealed variably elevated somatic mutation loads, in some instances characterized by distinct mutational signatures15,16,17,18. However, there is little direct information concerning the mutagenic effects of chemotherapy on normal tissues in vivo. Studies of a small number of individuals show that normal colorectal epithelium, blood and sperm can exhibit additional somatic mutations after chemotherapy19,20. Furthermore, chemotherapy can alter the clonal structure of normal cell populations, as illustrated in the blood, where treatment increases the incidence of clonal hematopoiesis, favoring clones with driver mutations in the DNA damage response genes PPM1D, TP53 and CHEK2 (refs. 21,22,23).

To survey the long-term impacts of chemotherapeutic agents on normal body tissues, we here investigate their effects on normal blood by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of cells from chemotherapy-exposed individuals. The blood offers several desirable features in this regard, including ease of randomly sampling cells from the whole tissue, predictable mutation accumulation in unexposed individuals24, opportunities to interrogate different cell subtypes and maturation states, and feasibility of surveying changes in cell population clonal structure.

To conduct a primary survey of chemotherapy effects on normal blood cell genomes, we analyzed 23 individuals with hematological or solid malignancies who had collectively been exposed to multiple chemotherapy classes and multiple members of each class, with variable time intervals since exposure. These individuals were aged 3–80 years and had been treated with commonly used chemotherapy regimens for hematological malignancies (Hodgkin lymphoma, n = 2; follicular lymphoma, n = 5; diffuse large B cell lymphoma, n = 2; lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, n = 1; marginal zone lymphoma, n = 1; multiple myeloma, n = 1; acute myeloid leukemia (AML), n = 1) and solid cancers (colorectal carcinoma, n = 9; neuroblastoma, n = 1; lung cancer, n = 1). One individual had been treated with chemotherapy for both multiple myeloma and colorectal carcinoma. The individual with AML had also been treated with chemotherapy for Behcet disease, a noncancer condition (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). Most had received a combination of agents and, collectively, had been exposed to 21 drugs from all of the main chemotherapy classes, including alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, n = 8; chlorambucil, n = 2; bendamustine, n = 5; procarbazine, n = 2; melphalan, n = 1), platinum agents (oxaliplatin, n = 7; carboplatin, n = 2; cisplatin, n = 1), antimetabolites (capecitabine, n = 7; 5-fluorouracil, n = 6; gemcitabine, n = 1; cytarabine, n = 1), topoisomerase I inhibitors (irinotecan, n = 5), topoisomerase II inhibitors (etoposide, n = 4; doxorubicin, n = 4; daunorubicin, n = 1; mitoxantrone, n = 1), vinca alkaloids (vincristine, n = 7; vinblastine, n = 1; vinorelbine, n = 1) and cytotoxic antibiotics (bleomycin, n = 1). The time intervals from chemotherapy exposure to tissue sampling ranged from less than 1 month to 6 years for most cases. However, one individual sampled at age 48 years had been treated for Hodgkin lymphoma at ages 10 and 47 years. Additionally, the individual sampled at age 43 years following induction chemotherapy for AML had also received long-term chlorambucil for Behcet disease diagnosed at age 13 years. Seven patients had also received localized radiotherapy (Supplementary Table 1). We endeavored to exclude a chemotherapy agent being administered in the context of only a single cancer type to avoid any confounding effects, but this was not always possible (Fig. 1a). Results were compared to those from nine healthy, non-chemotherapy-exposed individuals (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1).

Three experimental designs for detecting and analyzing somatic mutations were used. First, 189 single-cell-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) colonies from the 23 chemotherapy-exposed individuals and 90 colonies from the 9 controls were expanded and individually subjected to WGS at 23-fold average coverage to compare mutation burdens and mutational signatures (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Second, from six individuals exposed to a range of chemotherapeutic agents, a further 589 single-cell colonies underwent WGS (41–259 colonies per individual; mean sequencing depth 15-fold). These phylogenies were compared to similar-sized phylogenies (608 colonies) from five normal individuals across a similar age range to survey the effect of chemotherapy on the clonal structure of the HSPC population. Third, flow-sorted subpopulations of B cells, T memory cells, T naive cells and monocytes from whole-blood samples from 18 chemotherapy-exposed individuals and 3 unexposed normal individuals (Fig. 1b) underwent WGS using duplex sequencing, which allows reliable identification of somatic mutations in polyclonal cell populations25.

Somatic single-base substitution (SBS) mutations in HSPCs from normal adults accrue constantly at a rate of ~18 per year, leading to a burden of ~1,500 SBSs in 80-year-old individuals24. HSPCs from 17 of the 23 chemotherapy-exposed individuals showed elevated mutation burdens compared to those expected for their ages (P < 2.2 × 10−16, mixed-effects model) (Fig. 2). Four showed large increases of >1,000 SBSs (Fig. 2a), thirteen showed more modest increases of 200–600 SBSs (Fig. 2b), and six showed no increases (Extended Data Fig. 1c–f). The burdens of small indels in HSPCs were also increased in the four individuals with the greatest elevations in SBS burdens (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Increases in structural variant and copy number changes were not observed, including in those individuals exposed to topoisomerase II inhibitors, which have been implicated in the development of secondary malignancies driven by specific oncogenic rearrangements26 (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). However, the small number of individuals may have limited the statistical power to identify minor differences.

Source data

Nineteen of the twenty-three chemotherapy-treated individuals received multiple agents. Therefore, in many cases, it was uncertain which agents were responsible for the elevated mutation loads. To address this, we extracted mutational signatures from the SBS and indel mutation catalogs of chemotherapy-exposed individuals and controls and estimated the contribution of each signature to the somatic mutations in the blood cells of each individual (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3). We used prior knowledge of previously described mutational signatures attributed to normal endogenous mutational processes and to some mutagenic exposures27, as well as the specific chemotherapy regimens received by each individual, to associate each signature with its putative causative agent.

Twelve SBS mutational signatures were extracted (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 2). Four were composed of known signatures of normal HSPCs and mature lymphocytes (Supplementary Table 3). The first was predominantly constituted by SBS1, characterized by C>T mutations at CG dinucleotides, together with a contribution from SBS5, which is relatively flat and featureless. SBS1 and SBS5 are found in most normal cell types thus far studied. The second was SBSBlood, a blood-specific signature predominant in HSPCs28,29. The third was SBS7a, an ultraviolet light-caused signature found in memory T cells that have presumably resided in the skin during life30. The fourth was SBS9, a signature of somatic hypermutation found in B cells (Fig. 2c). Three indel mutational signatures were extracted (Supplementary Table 4). Two were similar to known indel signatures and were present in both normal and chemotherapy-exposed individuals: the first comprised ID1, and the second was a composite of ID3, ID5 and ID9 (ID3/5/9; Extended Data Fig. 3).

Eight SBS mutational signatures were interpreted as being present exclusively in chemotherapy-treated individuals (Fig. 2c), based on the observation that they accounted for <1% of mutations in HSPCs from adult controls (Extended Data Fig. 4). Four of these have not been reported previously and are not represented in the COSMIC SBS mutational signature database. SBSA is likely due to the triazene alkylating agent procarbazine. There were three similar but distinct signatures relating predominantly to specific nitrogen mustard alkylating agents: SBSC to chlorambucil, SBSD to bendamustine and SBSE to melphalan. SBSF is associated with the platinum agents cisplatin and carboplatin, and SBSG is associated with the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil or its prodrug capecitabine. The etiologies of SBSB and SBSH are less clear-cut and are discussed further below. Excess SBSs and specific SBS mutational signatures were not obviously associated with topoisomerase inhibitors (which cause DNA strand breaks), vinca alkaloids (which inhibit microtubule formation during cell division) and the cytotoxic antibiotic bleomycin (which is thought to bind and cleave DNA). Only one high-confidence indel mutational signature was found exclusively in chemotherapy-treated individuals: IDA, associated with procarbazine exposure.

SBSA contributed substantial additional mutation loads to blood cells from two individuals treated for Hodgkin lymphoma (PD50308 and PD47703) (Fig. 3). The only chemotherapy common to their treatment regimens was the alkylating agent procarbazine; no other individuals had been treated with procarbazine, and HSPC phylogenies indicated that SBSA mutations occurred early during PD47703's life, consistent with procarbazine treatment at age 10 years (Extended Data Fig. 5a). The observed mutational signatures were compared to those previously reported, using a combination of visual inspection, data review and the cosine similarity between trinucleotide mutation profiles. Cosine similarities >0.90 between two mutational signatures are highly unlikely to occur by chance, and a cosine similarity of >0.95 generally suggests the same underlying process. SBSA exhibits similarity to COSMIC signature SBS25 (cosine similarity 0.84), which has previously been associated with procarbazine19,31. An indel signature (IDA) was also identified as being most likely attributable to procarbazine, being found only in the two individuals treated with procarbazine (Extended Data Fig. 3). Alkylating agents cause alkyl DNA adducts, resulting in base mispairing and DNA breaks. Procarbazine is a triazene/hydrazine monofunctional alkylating agent.

Phylogenies were constructed using shared mutation data and the algorithm MPBoot (Methods). Branch lengths correspond to SBS burdens (x axes). A stacked bar plot represents the signatures contributing to each branch, with the color code below the trees. SBSUnassigned indicates mutations that could not confidently be assigned to any reported signature. Drugs in parentheses are those received by the individual at the same time but not believed to be the mutagenic agents.

SBSB was found predominantly in the individual exposed to chlorambucil, procarbazine and bendamustine (PD47703). SBSB, like SBSA (procarbazine), is predominantly composed of T>A substitutions, with a cosine similarity to SBSA of 0.82 and cosine similarities to SBSD (bendamustine; 0.82) and SBSC (chlorambucil; 0.74) suggesting that it is unlikely to be due to any of these in isolation. It is also present at low levels in the T memory cells of the other procarbazine-exposed individual who was also exposed to cyclophosphamide (PD50308). It seems plausible that SBSB may result from an interaction between two classes of alkylating agents.

Of the nitrogen mustard-associated signatures, SBSC contributed all mutations to the individual who received chlorambucil from childhood (PD37580); SBSD contributed all excess mutations to one of the individuals exposed to only bendamustine (PD60010) and was also present at a much lower burden in a subset of cyclophosphamide-exposed individuals; SBSE was found only in the single individual exposed to low-dose melphalan (PD47699). Nitrogen mustard alkylating agents have two reactive sites and are, in consequence, bifunctional, forming intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links in addition to simple adducts. The SBSC and SBSD signatures identified here are similar to a recently published mutational signature found in the germlines of two individuals whose fathers had been treated with two different nitrogen mustard agents (chlorambucil and ifosfamide)20,32, and SBSE is similar (cosine similarity 0.84) to the previously described signature in multiple myeloma genomes with prior melphalan exposure33,34,35.

SBSF was found in individuals treated with carboplatin or cisplatin and in a subset of oxaliplatin-treated individuals in whom it was present at much lower burdens. It is highly similar to COSMIC SBS31 (cosine similarity 0.95), which has previously been associated with prior platinum exposure in cancer genomes32,36 (Fig. 3). Platinum compounds act by binding DNA and forming intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, in a similar manner to bifunctional alkylating agents. However, SBSF/SBS31 is different from the bifunctional nitrogen mustard signatures, indicating that the patterns of DNA damage and/or DNA repair induced by platinum agents and nitrogen mustards differ.

SBSG is highly similar to COSMIC SBS17 (cosine similarity 0.93), which has previously been found in the genomes of cancers exposed to 5-fluorouracil37 and in the normal intestine of one 5-fluorouracil-exposed individual19. It was undetectable in HSPCs and found at the highest burdens in lymphoid cells from individuals treated with 5-fluorouracil or its prodrug capecitabine (Fig. 4). 5-Fluorouracil is a pyrimidine analog misincorporated into DNA in place of thymine, consistent with causing a mutational signature characterized predominantly by thymine mutations.

Stacked bar plots represent the absolute contributions of each SBS mutational signature to the SBS mutation burden across cell types (left), compared to the proportionate contribution of each signature (right). HSPC data were generated by pooling HSPC WGS colony data from each individual. Mature blood cell data were generated using duplex sequencing of ~40,000 cells of each type. For the normal unexposed individuals, the T cell subset data are from CD4+ T cells; for the chemotherapy-exposed individuals, the T cell subsets contain both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. SBSUnassigned indicates mutations that could not confidently be assigned to any reported signature. SBSNA indicates that duplex sequencing data are unavailable for this subset. In seven individuals, granulocyte mutation profiles were available, which were not discernibly different from the mutational spectra observed in HSPCs and monocytes from those individuals. Due to the lack of availability of this cell type for most patients, the data are not shown.

Source data

SBSH was detectable only in the T cells of a single individual who was also the only person to have received gemcitabine, a cytosine analog. However, the origin of SBSH remains uncertain.

The isolation of multiple HSPC colonies from each individual allowed for assessing the variation in mutagenic exposures across each of their HSPC populations. Although there was some variability in the mutation burdens attributable to cisplatin/carboplatin, procarbazine, chlorambucil and bendamustine (the most highly mutagenic agents) across HSPCs from each individual (Fig. 3), the evidence suggests that there were no HSPCs completely protected from DNA damage. The multiple HSPCs from each individual also allowed the formation of phylogenetic trees, permitting the timing of mutagenic impacts. The phylogenetic timings were in keeping with the known periods of exposure: PD47703 with both early-life exposure to procarbazine and chlorambucil and later-life exposure to bendamustine, PD37580 with both early- and late-life exposure to chlorambucil, and PD47699 with late-life exposure to melphalan (Fig. 3).

Although limited numbers of individuals, different drug combinations and different dose regimens preclude definitive evaluation, the inclusion of individuals treated with different members of the same chemotherapy class enabled a preliminary comparison of their effects. Among the nitrogen mustard alkylating agents, chlorambucil, bendamustine and melphalan caused substantially greater alkylating agent-associated mutation burdens in normal blood cells than cyclophosphamide, which engendered only minimal (<5% and hence not shown in the figures) increases in mutation load (Fig. 3, Extended Data Fig. 5b and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). Similarly, carboplatin and cisplatin caused much higher SBSF mutation burdens than oxaliplatin, which conferred SBSF mutation burdens of <5% in all cases, despite prolonged oxaliplatin treatment (up to 22 cycles) in some individuals (Fig. 3, Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). Therefore, chemotherapeutic agents of the same class, some used interchangeably in cancer treatment, may confer substantially different mutation burdens in normal blood cells.

Flow sorting of monocytes, B cells, T memory cells and T naive cells enabled us to investigate the responses of different cell types to identical chemotherapy exposures. Overall, the patterns of SBS signature burdens in monocytes were similar to those in HSPCs, whereas the patterns in B and T lymphocytes showed differences for some agents (Supplementary Table 7). For example, SBSG, caused by 5-fluorouracil/capecitabine, contributed additional mutation burdens in B lymphocytes (P = 0.0), T naive cells (P = 0.0097) and T memory lymphocytes (P = 0.0014), but was undetectable in HSPCs and monocytes (Fig. 4). In contrast, SBSF, caused by the platinum agents, contributed larger mutation burdens in HSPCs, monocytes and B cells than in T naive and T memory cells, although we only have T cell data for one carboplatin-exposed individual (Fig. 4). The mutation loads contributed by SBSA, caused by procarbazine, were similar across cell types. Therefore, some chemotherapeutic agents engender different mutation burdens in different cell types.

To investigate the effect of chemotherapies on the architecture of cell populations, we generated extensive phylogenies of HSPCs from six chemotherapy-exposed individuals and compared them to the HSPC phylogenies of nonexposed individuals of similar ages. An exemplar HSPC phylogeny of a normal, non-chemotherapy-exposed 48-year-old individual showed only one barely detectable clonal expansion and no ‘driver' mutations in cancer genes (Fig. 5a). Such trees are typical of healthy middle-aged adults24.

a,b, Phylogenies for two normal unexposed donors: one young adult (a) and one older adult (b). c,d, Phylogenies for two young adult chemotherapy-treated individuals, both with more than one chemotherapy exposure. Phylogenies were constructed using shared mutation data and the algorithm MPBoot (Methods). Branch lengths reflect the number of mutations assigned to the branch, with the terminal branches adjusted for sequence coverage; the overall root-to-tip branch lengths have been normalized to the same total length (because all colonies were collected from a single time point). The y axis represents the number of SBSs accumulating over time. Each tip on a phylogeny represents a single colony, with the respective numbers of colonies of each cell and tissue type recorded at the top. Onto these trees, we have layered clone- and colony-specific phenotypic information. We have highlighted branches on which we have identified known oncogenic drivers in 1 of 18 clonal hematopoiesis genes (Supplementary Table 2) color-coded by gene. A heat map at the bottom of each phylogeny highlights colonies from known driver clades colored by gene and the expanded clades (defined as those with a clonal fraction of >1%) in blue. In the individual in d, the AML was derived from the biallelic TP53-mutated clade carrying TP53 p.I195F and TP53 p.C176Y. Drugs not highlighted in bold text are those received by the individual at the same time but not believed to be the mutagenic agents.

Given that changes in the clonal composition of the HSPC population due to chemotherapy-induced bottlenecks and positive selection may take many years to become apparent, we focused on two individuals sampled 30 and 39 years after their earliest exposure to chemotherapy (PD37580 and PD47703; Fig. 5c,d). In contrast to normal middle-aged individuals, a 48-year-old woman (PD47703) treated for Hodgkin lymphoma with chlorambucil and procarbazine at age 10 years and bendamustine at age 47 years showed multiple independent clonal expansions carrying ‘driver' mutations in the DNA damage response gene PPM1D (Fig. 5c). A similar pattern, with expanded PPM1D and TP53 mutant clones, was observed in a 43-year-old woman (PD37580) after long-term chlorambucil treatment (Fig. 5d). This pattern of multiple, large clonal expansions is characteristic of normal individuals aged >70 years24. However, in healthy older adults, clonal expansions exhibit predominantly DNMT3A and TET2 driver mutations or no apparent driver (Fig. 5b). While TP53 and PPM1D mutations can also be observed in the context of normal aging, the pattern of dozens of parallel clonal expansions harboring these mutations is likely to reflect the unique selective landscape induced by some chemotherapies.

Chemotherapy could induce this prematurely aged HSPC cell population profile by increasing mutation loads and/or by altering microenvironmental selection. Chemotherapy favors the survival of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) clones with driver mutations in PPM1D, TP53 and CHEK2 (ref. 21), which usually predate the chemotherapy. Similarly, the HSPC phylogenetic tree of PD37580 indicates that at least two PPM1D driver mutations arose before the chemotherapy given during childhood (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Furthermore, in PD47703, a comparison of two samples taken 1 year apart, during which additional chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and vincristine) had been administered, revealed an approximately 50% increase in the size of preexisting PPM1D mutated clones and no new mutant clones (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Thus, chemotherapy-induced changes in selection appear more influential than chemotherapy-induced creation of new driver mutations in generating the prematurely aged HSPC profile.

The prematurely aged architecture of the HSPC population was not observed in two young adults (PD50308 aged 29 years and PD50307 aged 40 years) who received chemotherapy that caused substantial increases in mutation loads and was administered 2 years or less before sampling (Extended Data Fig. 8). It was also not observed in two further individuals who were treated with cyclophosphamide and oxaliplatin (PD44579 aged 63 years and PD47537 aged 61 years) and exhibited minimally increased mutation loads (Extended Data Fig. 9). Therefore, it is conceivable that multiple and/or prolonged chemotherapeutic exposures are required to generate the prematurely aged architecture. However, it is also possible that chemotherapy-engendered clonal expansions require decades to become detectable, as already demonstrated for clones under positive selection during normal aging24,38.

Changes in clonal architecture resulting from chemotherapy exposure are relevant for two reasons: first, PPM1D mutant clones may themselves reduce the regenerative ability of the bone marrow21,39, or the presence of PPM1D clones may simply be a marker of a more general state of reduced hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function after chemotherapy. One may speculate that the presence of many such clones had a role in the development of cytopenias and infections in PD47703 following autograft treatment. Second, the selection of TP53 mutant clones confers a high risk of developing secondary myeloid malignancies, including AML as seen in PD37580, whose disease was treatment-refractory and carried biallelic TP53 mutations and a complex karyotype.

This initial survey demonstrates that some commonly used chemotherapies, at dose regimens used in clinical practice, increase somatic mutation burdens and alter the population structure of normal blood cells. Individuals with elevated mutation burdens have likely experienced very high mutation rates over short periods. For example, an additional 1,000 SBSs acquired in an HSPC due to chemotherapy administered during the course of 1 year is equivalent to an approximately 50-fold increase in the average mutation rate over the year, and it is plausible that mutation rates within hours or days of chemotherapy are even higher. The additional long-term mutation loads are also sometimes considerable. A 3-year-old boy treated for neuroblastoma had more than tenfold the number of somatic SBSs expected for his age, exceeding the burden in normal 80-year-old individuals.

The additional mutation burdens differed substantially both between chemotherapy classes and between agents of the same class. As an important mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of many chemotherapies is thought to be DNA damage induction, it is notable that different agents of the same class, at their therapeutic doses, have such different impacts on mutation generation in normal cells. The reasons for this are unclear but may reflect subtle differences between agents in the nature of the DNA damage caused, the repairability of the damage, the extent of induction of normal cell death and the levels of normal cell exposure. For example, cyclophosphamide is thought to relatively spare HSPCs due to their higher levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme that inactivates a cyclophosphamide intermediary40. However, it may also be the case that the extent of DNA damage does not directly correlate with the level of cytotoxicity of some chemotherapies.

The additional mutation burdens caused by chemotherapies are characterized by distinct mutational signatures, often shared by agents of the same class. The signatures are similar to those induced by the same agents in cancer cells, suggesting that the patterns of induced DNA damage, and its processing into mutations through DNA repair and replication, are similar in normal and cancer cells, even if the tolerance of DNA damage by normal and cancer cells differs.

Increases in mutation loads imposed by chemotherapies differed between blood cell types, and the profile of differences between cell types differed between chemotherapeutic agents. The mechanisms underlying these complex landscapes are uncertain but may reflect intrinsic differences in the metabolic capabilities, DNA repair capacities and cell division rates of the different cell types.

Changes in hematopoietic clonal architecture characterized by increasing dominance of large clones, often with driver mutations in cancer genes, are a feature of normal aging. Chemotherapy caused a similar pattern of change prematurely, although with a different repertoire of mutated genes. However, these changes were not observed in all individuals. Whether these chemotherapy-induced changes in population architecture are contingent on the long duration and/or multiplicity of treatment, or simply occur with the passage of decades after treatment (which may allow clones with limited growth advantage under normal conditions to become detectable), requires further investigation.

This study has limitations. In addition to the small number of individuals, solid tumors were predominantly colorectal carcinoma, hematological cancers were predominantly of lymphoid origin, and not all mutagenic chemotherapies may have been included. We were unable to address the role of multiple other plausible factors influencing mutation burdens and selective effects, such as the pharmacokinetics of drug administration. We acknowledge that the in vitro culture of HSPCs may have introduced an unintended sampling bias, and future studies should address how the observed changes in the clonal composition of HSPCs following chemotherapy translate to differences in circulating mature blood cells.

Together with other work17,32,41, our study points to a future agenda for systematic genomic analysis of normal tissues after chemotherapy. These studies could incorporate a wider range of at-risk normal tissues, sampled before and after treatment, after short and long periods, and across the full range of chemotherapies. Within the single-disease setting of clinical trials, this approach could aim to improve combination chemotherapeutic regimens and address dose–mutation relationships. Comprehensive prospective surveys of this nature would improve the understanding of the consequences of widespread, self-administered mutagenic exposure in human populations and provide a scientific basis for optimizing long-term patient health.

In conclusion, some chemotherapies impose additional mutational loads and change the cell population structure of normal blood. Both impacts plausibly contribute to long-term consequences, including second malignancies, infertility and loss of normal tissue resilience. Clinical data support this view, with the most mutagenic agents in this study having measurably greater long-term treatment toxicities. For example, of the bifunctional alkylating agents, melphalan and chlorambucil are associated with higher risks of secondary malignancies than cyclophosphamide3,42,43. In addition, procarbazine has been associated with a particularly high risk of second cancer and infertility and is, for this reason, no longer used in the treatment of pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma44. Given that, in many cancer types, chemotherapeutic agents within a single class can be used interchangeably to achieve similar clinical outcomes45,46,47, it may be possible to prospectively use these types of data when improving existing regimens or developing new treatment protocols. In patients previously exposed to chemotherapy, knowledge of their altered mutational and clonal landscape could also prompt discussions as to suitability for standard treatment protocols, particularly in the autologous transplant setting, and allow exploring alternative options where appropriate.

Our research complies with all relevant ethical regulations as approved by the National Health Service (NHS) Cambridgeshire 4 Research Ethics Committee, Cambridge East Ethics Committee and the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board (see additional information below).

No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size. We removed a total of 96 colonies from the dataset of 931 previously unpublished colonies: 32 for being technical duplicates, 29 for showing evidence of nonclonality or contamination and 23 due to low coverage. The experiments were not randomized, and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

Blood or bone marrow samples from individuals unexposed to chemotherapy were obtained from three sources: (1) STEMCELL Technologies provided frozen mononuclear cells (MNCs) for the cord blood sample that had been collected with written informed consent, including for WGS (catalogue number 70007); all data were previously published. (2) Cambridge Blood and Stem Cell Biobank provided fresh peripheral blood samples taken with written informed consent from two patients at Addenbrooke's Hospital (NHS Cambridgeshire 4 Research Ethics Committee reference 07/MRE05/44 for samples collected before November 2019 and Cambridge East Ethics Committee reference 18/EE/0199 for samples collected from November 2019 onward); all data were previously published. (3) Cambridge Biorepository for Translational Medicine provided frozen bone marrow samples with or without peripheral blood MNCs taken with informed consent from seven deceased organ donors. Samples were obtained at the time of abdominal organ collection (Cambridgeshire 4 Research Ethics Committee reference 15/EE/0152); data were previously published from four individuals, with new data generated from an additional two individuals (PD49236 and PD49327).

Blood samples from individuals previously exposed to chemotherapy were obtained from two sources: (1) Cambridge Blood and Stem Cell Biobank provided fresh peripheral blood samples taken with written informed consent from 22 patients at Addenbrooke's Hospital (NHS Cambridgeshire 4 Research Ethics Committee reference 07/MRE05/44 for samples collected before November 2019 and Cambridge East Ethics Committee reference 18/EE/0199 for samples collected from November 2019 onward); all data were unpublished. One chemotherapy-exposed individual, PD47703, had two samples taken at time points a year apart. All others were sampled at a single time point. (2) Baylor College of Medicine provided single-cell-derived hematopoietic colonies from the bone marrow taken following written informed consent from one patient from MD Anderson Cancer Center (Research Ethics Committee of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board reference PA12-0305 (genomic analysis protocol) and LAB01-473 (laboratory protocol)).

Details of the individuals studied and the samples they provided are listed in Fig. 1a, with additional information in Supplementary Table 1. All participants provided written informed consent to have their anonymized details published. Participants did not receive compensation for taking part in the study.

Whole blood was diluted 1:1 with PBS, after which MNCs were isolated using Lymphoprep density gradient centrifugation (STEMCELL Technologies). Red cell lysis was performed on the MNC fraction using one incubation at 4 °C for 15 min with red blood cell lysis buffer (BioLegend).

For all the unexposed normal samples and the PD47703 second-time-point sample, single-cell colony expansion in vitro was undertaken in liquid culture, exactly as previously described1.

Peripheral blood and cord blood MNC samples underwent CD34+ cell selection using the EasySep human whole blood CD34-positive selection kit (STEMCELL Technologies), with only a single round of magnetic selection. Bone marrow MNCs were not selected for CD34+ cells before sorting.

MNC or CD34-enriched samples were stained (30 min at 4 °C) in PBS/3% FBS containing the following antibodies: CD3 FITC (1 in 500), CD90 PE (1 in 50), CD49f PE-Cy5 (1 in 100), CD38 PE-Cy7 (1 in 100), CD19 A700 (1 in 300), CD34 APC-Cy7 (1 in 100), CD45RA BV421 (1 in 100) and Zombie Aqua (1 in 2,000) (Supplementary Table 8). Cells were then washed and resuspended in PBS/3% FBS for cell sorting. Either a BD Aria III or BD Aria Fusion cell sorter (BD Biosciences) was used to sort ‘HSC/MPP' pool cells (Lin−, CD34+, CD38−, CD45RA−) at the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) Cell Phenotyping Hub. Supplementary Fig. 1 illustrates the gating strategy used.

Single phenotypic HSPCs were index-sorted into single wells of 96-well plates containing StemPro medium (STEMCELL Technologies), StemPro Nutrients (0.035%, STEMCELL Technologies), l-glutamine (1%, ThermoFisher), penicillin–streptomycin (1%, ThermoFisher) and cytokines (stem cell factor, 100 ng ml−1; FLT3, 20 ng ml−1; thrombopoietin, 100 ng ml−1; erythropoietin, 3 ng ml−1; interleukin-6 (IL-6), 50 ng ml−1; IL-3, 10 ng ml−1; IL-11, 50 ng ml−1; granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor, 20 ng ml−1; IL-2, 10 ng ml−1; IL-7, 20 ng ml−1; lipids, 50 ng ml−1) and expanded into colonies. Cells were incubated at 37 °C, and the colonies that formed were topped up with 50 μl StemPro medium plus supplements at 14 ± 2 days as necessary. At 21 ± 2 days, colonies were collected. DNA extraction was performed using either the DNEasy 96 blood and tissue plate kit (Qiagen) or the Arcturus PicoPure DNA extraction kit (ThermoFisher) per the manufacturer's instructions.

For the chemotherapy-exposed peripheral blood samples, single-cell colonies were expanded in MethoCult (H4435 or H4034, STEMCELL Technologies). MNCs were plated at a density of 7.5–45 × 104 cells per ml in MethoCult and incubated at 37 °C for 14 days. The cell suspensions were made up in StemSpan II (STEMCELL Technologies) before being mixed thoroughly with MethoCult and plated into a SmartDish (STEMCELL Technologies). Individual BFU-E (burst-forming unit erythroid) or CFU-GM (colony-forming unit granulocyte–macrophage) colonies were picked, added to 17 μl proteinase K (PicoPure DNA extraction kit, Fisher Scientific; with each vial of lyophilized proteinase K resuspended in 130 μl reconstitution buffer), and incubated at 65 °C for 6 h and at 75 °C for 30 min to extract DNA in preparation for sequencing.

Previous studies have shown that there is no difference in mutation burden between HSCs and hematopoietic progenitor cells24 and that there is a mutation burden difference of only approximately 30 SBS mutations between HSCs and mature granulocytes25.

WGS libraries were prepared from 1–5 ng of extracted DNA from each colony using a low-input enzymatic fragmentation-based library preparation method48,49. WGS was performed on the NovaSeq platform (Illumina). Paired-end reads of 150 bp were aligned to the human reference genome (National Center for Biotechnology Information build 37) using BWA-MEM.

The method for substitution calling involved three main steps: mutation discovery, filtering and genotyping, as described previously19 (Supplementary Methods).

For the creation of the larger phylogenies (a subset of six chemotherapy-exposed and five unexposed individuals with >40 sequenced colonies), a binomial filtering strategy could be applied as previously described24 (https://github.com/emily-mitchell/normal_haematopoiesis/2_variant_filtering_tree_building/scripts/).

For the subset of colonies sequenced at the highest depth (four to ten colonies per individual), we were unable to use binomial filtering approaches due to the low sample number. Instead, the following filters were applied to the data using a custom R script: (1) variants present in more than half the samples from an individual were removed as being most likely germline. (2) Variants were only called as present in a given sample if they had two or more supporting reads and were present at a variant allele fraction (VAF) of ≥0.2 in autosomes or ≥0.4 for sex chromosomes. (3) High- and low-depth sites with a mean depth of >50 or <8 across all samples from an individual were removed.

This variant filtering approach was validated using samples from the normal individuals, in whom both the binomial and nonbinomial filtering strategies were applied to the same samples, giving comparable results (Supplementary Fig. 2). This dataset, comparable across all the individuals in the study, was used for the analysis of SBS and indel mutation burdens.

We removed a total of 96 colonies from the dataset of 931 previously unpublished colonies: 32 for being technical duplicates, 29 for showing evidence of nonclonality or contamination and 23 due to low coverage. Visual inspection of the VAF distribution plots was performed, and a peak VAF threshold of <0.4 was used (after the removal of in vitro variants) to identify colonies with evidence of nonclonality.

Due to the difficulty in correcting for sequencing depth when only a small number of samples are sequenced per individual, SBS and indel burden analysis was performed on raw data from the subset of chemotherapy-exposed and unexposed samples sequenced at a relatively high depth (four to ten samples per individual; mean coverage 23×, range 13–33×). We have previously shown that sequencing depth has little impact on the SBS mutation burden over this higher range24. There were minor differences in sequencing depth when comparing the chemotherapy and normal cohorts or when comparing sequencing depth by chemotherapy exposure, but these would not be expected to affect the interpretation of the results presented (Extended Data Fig. 1).

Given the known influence of age on mutation burden, we built a linear mixed-effect model to quantify how age and chemotherapy treatment influence mutation burdens. Patient ID (PDID) was added as a random effect to the model, which was as follows:

MPBoot, a maximum parsimony tree approximation method50, was used to build and annotate phylogenetic trees of the relationships between the sampled HSPCs, as previously described24 (Supplementary Methods).

The key steps to generate the phylogenies shown in Fig. 5 and Extended Data Figs. 8 and 9 are as follows:

Generate a ‘genotype matrix' of mutation calls for every colony within a donor. Our protocol, based on WGS of single-cell-derived colonies, generates consistent and even coverage across the genome, leading to very few missing values within this matrix (ranging from 0.005 to 0.034 of mutated sites in a given colony across different donors within our cohort). This generates a high degree of accuracy in the constructed trees.

Reconstruct phylogenetic trees from the genotype matrix. This is a standard and well-studied problem in phylogenetics. The low fraction of the genome that is mutated in a given colony (<1 per million bases), coupled with the highly complete genotype matrix, means that different phylogenetic methods produce reassuringly concordant trees. We used the MPBoot algorithm for the tree reconstruction, as it proved both accurate and computationally efficient for our dataset.

Correct terminal branch lengths for sensitivity to detect mutations in each colony. The trees generated in the previous step have branch lengths proportional to the number of mutations assigned to each branch. For the terminal branches, which contain mutations unique to that colony, variable sequencing depth can underestimate the true numbers of unique mutations, so we correct these branch lengths for the estimated sensitivity to detect mutations based on genome coverage.

Make phylogenetic trees ultrametric. After step 3, there is little more than Poisson variation in the corrected mutation burden among colonies from a given donor. As these colonies were all derived from the same time point, we can normalize the branch lengths to have the same overall distance from root to tip (known as an ultrametric tree). We used an ‘iteratively reweighted means' algorithm for this purpose.

Scale trees to chronological age. As the mutation rate is constant across the human lifespan, we can use it as a ‘molecular clock' to linearly scale the ultrametric tree to chronological age.

Overlay phenotypic and genotypic information on the tree.

Overlay phenotypic and genotypic information on the tree. The tip of each branch in the resulting phylogenetic tree represents a specific colony in the dataset, meaning that we can depict phenotypic information about each colony underneath its terminal branch (the colored stripes along the bottom of Fig. 5 and Extended Data Figs. 8 and 9). Furthermore, every mutation in the dataset is confidently assigned to a specific branch in the phylogenetic tree. This means that we can highlight branches on which specific genetic events occurred (such as DNMT3A or other driver mutations).

To estimate the number of somatic mutations that may have already been acquired by PD37580 by age 13 years (before commencing chlorambucil), we used the linear mixed model defined by Mitchell et al. This model estimates an intercept of 54.57 (that is, the mean number of somatic mutations present at birth), with a slope of 16.832 representing the mean number of somatic mutations acquired each year of life. This results in an expected mean somatic mutation burden of 273 at age 13 years. Assuming that this mutation burden is Poisson distributed provides a 95% prediction interval of 241–306.

The variants identified were annotated with VAGrENT (Variation Annotation GENeraTor) (https://github.com/cancerit/VAGrENT) to identify protein-coding mutations and putative driver mutations in each dataset. Supplementary Table 9 lists the 18 genes we have used as our top clonal hematopoiesis genes (those identified in ref. 38 as being under positive selection in a targeted sequencing dataset of 385 older individuals, with CHEK2 added as being an additional gene commonly under positive selection in chemotherapy-exposed individuals). ‘Oncogenic' mutations (as assessed by E.M.) are shown in Fig. 5 and Extended Data Figs. 8 and 9.

MNCs were stained for 30 min at 4 °C in PBS/3% FCS containing the following antibodies: Zombie Aqua (1 in 400), CD3 APC (1 in 80), CD19 AF700 (1 in 80), CD45RA PerCP-Cy5.5 (1 in 80), CCR7 BV711 (1 in 80) and CD14 BV605 (1 in 80). Cells were then washed and resuspended in PBS/3% FBS for sorting. Either a BD Aria III or BD Aria Fusion cell sorter (BD Biosciences) was used to sort various mature cell compartments (B cells, T naive cells, T memory cells and monocytes) at the NIHR Cambridge BRC Cell Phenotyping Hub. For each cell type, approximately 40,000 cells were sorted into Eppendorf tubes containing 50 μl PBS. Further details are provided in Supplementary Table 10 and Supplementary Fig. 3.

MNCs were stained for 30 min at 4 °C in PBS/3% FCS containing the following antibodies: CD3 APC (1 in 80), CD4 BV785 (1 in 80), CD8 BV785 (1 in 40), CD14 BV605 (1 in 80), CD19 AF700 (1 in 80), CD20 PE-Dazzle (1 in 80), CD27 BV421 (1 in 80), CD34 APC-Cy7 (1 in 27), CD38 FITC (1 in 80), CD45RA PerCP-Cy5.5 (1 in 80), CD56 PE (1 in 80), CCR7 BV711 (1 in 80), IgD PE-Cy7 (1 in 100) and Zombie Aqua (1 in 400). Cells were then washed and resuspended in PBS/3% FBS for sorting. Either a BD Aria III or BD Aria Fusion cell sorter (BD Biosciences) was used to sort various mature cell compartments (B cells, CD4+ T naive cells, CD4+ T memory cells, CD8+ T naive cells, CD8+ T memory cells and monocytes) at the NIHR Cambridge BRC Cell Phenotyping Hub. For each cell type, approximately 40,000 cells were sorted into Eppendorf tubes containing 50 μl PBS. Further details are provided in Supplementary Table 11 and Supplementary Fig. 4.

Approximately 40,000 cells of each mature cell type from the above sorts (suspended in 200 μl PBS) were added to single wells of a 96-well PCR plate and centrifuged. Pellets were resuspended in 17 μl proteinase K (PicoPure DNA extraction kit, Fisher Scientific; with each vial of lyophilized proteinase K resuspended in 130 μl reconstitution buffer) and incubated at 65 °C for 6 h and at 75 °C for 30 min to extract DNA in preparation for sequencing.

Extracted DNA (1–5 ng) from bulk cell sorts was submitted to the NanoSeq pipeline for library preparation and sequencing, as has been described previously25 (Supplementary Methods).

The HDP (https://github.com/nicolaroberts/hdp), based on the Bayesian HDP, was used to extract mutational signatures. The HDP was run without priors on SBSs derived from phylogenetic trees obtained from HSPCs and mutations from NanoSeq samples. The NanoSeq mutations were corrected for the trinucleotide context abundance for each sample (Supplementary Methods).

The COSMIC (v3.4)27 signatures identified were SBS1, SBS5, SBS7a, SBS9 and SBS17. One of the HDP components corresponded to the SBSBlood signature previously reported30. Eight components were de novo signatures called predominantly in individuals with chemotherapy exposure. Only signatures with a contribution of >5% of the mutations of the sample's burden were considered.

Eight chemotherapy-related signatures derived from the HDP (SBSA–SBSH) were examined for their occurrence in exposed versus nonexposed individuals. The proportions of the signatures contributing to the samples in the exposed versus nonexposed group were compared using the t test for independent samples, with an equal variance assumption. The test was performed in two ways: (1) per cell type (Supplementary Table 5) and (2) by combining the samples across cell types for each individual (Supplementary Table 6). The P values were adjusted for multiple testing corrections using the false discovery rate and Bonferroni methods.

Indel signatures were extracted from small indels called from the HSPC dataset using two different methods. First, mSigHdp was run, identifying three distinct indel signatures (https://github.com/steverozen/mSigHdp)51. To investigate whether the extracted de novo signatures were composed of reference COSMIC signatures, we used the SigProfilerAssignment decompose tool (https://github.com/AlexandrovLab/SigProfilerAssignment)52. Two signatures were successfully decomposed, the first into ID1 and ID2 with a reconstructed cosine similarity of 0.99 (compared to the de novo signature). The second signature was decomposed into ID3, ID5 and ID9 with a reconstructed cosine similarity of 0.93. The final signature, IDA, was initially decomposed into ID2 and ID18 with a reconstructed cosine similarity of 0.88. ID18 is a signature associated with colibactin exposure19, which is unlikely in this context. This, in combination with the lower cosine similarity and strong support from the mutation spectra of individuals treated with procarbazine, led to this decomposition being rejected.

Pathogenic mutations in PPM1D have been highlighted (pink) to facilitate comparison of clone sizes at each timepoint. In addition a loss of function mutation in CSF3R has been highlighted (blue), which could also be contributing to loss of haematopoietic reserve and cytopenias. Red bars show the size of clonal fractions at each timepoint. Terminal branches have been adjusted for sequence coverage, and overall root-to-tip branch lengths have been normalized to the same total length (because all colonies were collected from a single time point).

The y-axis represents the number of SBSs accumulating over time. Each tip on a phylogeny represents a single colony, with the respective numbers of colonies of each cell and tissue type recorded at the top.

One of the most influential scientific societies in the United States is in turmoil. Budget cuts by the administration of President Donald Trump have forced the US National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) into a wholesale reorganization. At the same time, many members are arguing that academy leaders have gone too far to accommodate the Trump administration — and done too little to defend science.

Since Trump took office in January, his administration has cancelled or suspended tens of millions of dollars' worth of contracts for advisory reports crafted by academy members and other scientists for sponsors including the US government. Meanwhile, the pipeline of contracts for future reports has largely dried up. These realities have already pushed the academies' operations and publication branch, the National Research Council (NRC), to pare 50–100 people from its roughly 1,200-person staff, and hundreds more are expected to be laid off.

“We are a target”: scientific society under pressure after Trump DEI crackdown

“We are a target”: scientific society under pressure after Trump DEI crackdown

NASEM members who spoke to Nature acknowledge the challenges facing leaders trying to preserve the institution, but some have accused the NASEM leadership of a lack of transparency, silence in the face of historic attacks on science and even censorship. In the latest example, critics cite internal guidance issued in March suggesting that the NRC will no longer permit research assessments “on topics explicitly related” to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility — principles disfavoured by the Trump administration.

The upheaval has spurred talk of a no-confidence vote in Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences and chair of the NRC. “What's the point in preserving the NRC as an organization if it loses its scientific integrity?” asks Charles Manski, an academy member and an economist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.

In an interview with Nature, McNutt sympathized with her critics' views, but said she is confronted with a “Faustian dilemma” in which challenging the administration, as many members advocate, could bring about the end of the organization, which depends on federal contracts for its existence. “What we are hoping is that sanity will prevail again some time in the future,” she says. “If it does, I'm not sure I want to be in the position where I have put the academy out of business.” 

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Every year, the NRC releases about 200 reports on topics ranging from the best pavement materials to the future of high-energy particle physics. These are authored by specialists including NASEM members, who are elected for their contributions to the sciences. US federal agencies, such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), commission many NRC studies, which policymakers regard as gold-standard advice. Last year, contracts with federal agencies supplied 59% of the NRC's roughly $360-million budget.

Last month, the organization announced a plan to consolidate internal divisions and reduce the number of NRC advisory boards, which guide study projects. McNutt says the current expectation is a 15% reduction in budget and staff by the end of August and a 30% reduction by the end of the year.

Most academy members — as well as NRC staff members, who are in danger of being laid off — have been cut out of the process, says Elissa Newport, an academy member and neuroscientist at Georgetown University in Washington DC.

On 18 June, Newport sent an e-mail signed by more than a dozen academy members to McNutt and the NRC leadership, calling on them to consult with employees, board members and rank-and-file members about the reorganization. McNutt's response — that leadership has consulted some members and does not have time to seek broader input — failed to satisfy. “They feel that the timeline requires an urgent process that must be kept confidential, and we strongly disagree with that,” Newport says.

On his first day in office, Trump banned federal programmes and contracts about diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA). Within a month, biomedical news outlet STAT reported that the academies were removing terms such as ‘health equity' from reports to placate the administration.

On 7 March, NASEM acknowledged these concerns in internal guidance documents summarizing institutional policies. One controversial provision clarified that although foreign assistance and climate change remained acceptable topics, despite being on the Trump team's chopping block, anything explicitly related to DEIA would be prohibited. “It does not matter if the potential sponsor is federal or private,” the document states.

Have Trump's anti-DEI orders hit private funders? HHMI halts inclusive science programme

“That would be censorship, and that would be the NRC selling its soul,” Manski says. The academy's critics argue that Trump's ban focuses on progammes that actively promote diversity and does not prevent the NRC from doing research on equity.

McNutt concedes the point about censorship, but argues that a new DEI study would probably be the NRC's last. “I'm completely sympathetic to [critics'] views” about censorship, she says, but “that is exactly what is being imposed on us.”

To understand how aging affects functional decline and increases disease risk, it is necessary to develop measures of how fast a person is aging. Using data from the Dunedin Study, we introduce an accurate and reliable measure for the rate of longitudinal aging derived from cross-sectional brain magnetic resonance imaging, that is, the Dunedin Pace of Aging Calculated from NeuroImaging (DunedinPACNI). Exporting this measure to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, UK Biobank and BrainLat datasets revealed that faster DunedinPACNI predicted cognitive impairment, accelerated brain atrophy and conversion to diagnosed dementia. Faster DunedinPACNI also predicted physical frailty, poor health, future chronic diseases and mortality in older adults. When compared to brain age gap, DunedinPACNI was similarly or more strongly related to clinical outcomes. DunedinPACNI is a next-generation brain magnetic resonance imaging biomarker that can help researchers explore aging effects on health outcomes and evaluate the effectiveness of antiaging strategies.

Aging is the gradual, progressive and correlated decline of multiple organ systems over decades. Longitudinal studies provide evidence for substantial individual variation in the rate of aging; people born in the same year can age slower or faster than their peers1,2,3. Furthermore, aging itself is increasingly regarded as a potentially preventable cause of chronic disease. Accordingly, accurate and reliable measures of how fast a person is aging are needed to effectively study how individual variation in the rate of aging contributes to disease risk and to evaluate interventions intended to slow aging before irreversible decline4,5,6,7,8.

Age-sensitive alterations in DNA methylation, referred to as epigenetic clocks, are currently the most widely used measures for estimating individual differences in aging4,9,10. First-generation epigenetic clocks were trained on chronological age11,12, but the more precisely they predicted chronological age, the less well they predicted clinical outcomes13,14. In response, second-generation clocks were trained on measures of health that predict mortality in older people15,16,17. However, these clocks were trained on cross-sectional phenotypes in multiage samples, not on longitudinal observations of the same person as recommended in geroscience5,18. This limitation led to the development of a third-generation longitudinal approach to measuring aging.

We previously adopted this longitudinal approach in the Dunedin Study, which has followed a population representative sample of 1,037 people born in the same year (1972–1973) from birth to age 45 (ref. 19). Across two decades (ages = 26, 32, 38 and 45 years), we repeatedly measured 19 biomarkers of cardiovascular, metabolic, renal, immune, dental and pulmonary functioning. By averaging the decline in the trajectories of these biomarkers, we operationalized the theoretical construct of biological aging into a specific measure that we called the Pace of Aging2. We subsequently developed an epigenetic clock that accurately and reliably estimates the Pace of Aging: the Dunedin Pace of Aging Calculated from the Epigenome (DunedinPACE)20. Because DunedinPACE is calculated from a single time point measurement of DNA methylation, it has been rapidly adopted by studies on aging, where it has been associated with signs of accelerated brain aging, morbidity and mortality20,21,22,23,24,25. However, it has not been possible to export DunedinPACE or other epigenetic clocks to studies lacking DNA methylation data. This includes many neuroimaging studies of brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Current neuroimaging-based approaches to measure aging, akin to first-generation epigenetic clocks, involve training models to predict chronological age from variability in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of brain structure in large multiage samples26,27,28,29,30. Researchers then typically quantify a brain age gap, which reflects the difference between a participant's predicted and actual chronological age. A positive brain age gap is interpreted as evidence of accelerated brain aging. As with first-generation epigenetic clocks, these age deviation approaches unavoidably mix model error (for example, historical differences in environmental exposures, survivor bias, disease effects, measurement bias) with a person's true rate of biological aging31,32,33.

In this study, using a single T1-weighted MRI scan collected at age 45 in the Dunedin Study, we describe the development and validation of a brain MRI measure for the Pace of Aging (Fig. 1a–c). We call this measure Dunedin Pace of Aging Calculated from NeuroImaging (DunedinPACNI). Using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we evaluated the test–retest reliability of DunedinPACNI. Exporting the measure to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), UK Biobank (UKB) and Latin American Brain Health Institute (BrainLat) datasets, we conducted a series of preregistered analyses (https://rb.gy/b9x4u6) designed to evaluate the utility of DunedinPACNI for predicting multiple aging-related health outcomes (Fig. 1d). To benchmark our findings, we compared the effect sizes for DunedinPACNI to those for brain age gap34. DunedinPACNI is a brain-based measure trained to directly estimate longitudinal aging of non-brain organ systems. Therefore, if DunedinPACNI indeed estimates individual differences in the rate of aging, it would add evidence for close links between brain integrity and whole-body aging and establish neuroimaging as a powerful tool for measuring aging, that is, not just of the brain but of the entire body35.

Hypothetical individual trajectories are shown for people with relatively slow, average and fast Pace of Aging from ages 26 to 45 years. b, Distribution of Pace of Aging scores in Dunedin Study members at age 45. Warmer colors represent a faster Pace of Aging; cooler colors represent a slower Pace of Aging. c, A single T1-weighted MRI scan collected from 860 Dunedin Study members at age 45 years was used to train an elastic net regression model to predict the Pace of Aging. We call the resulting measure DunedinPACNI. d, Regression weights from the DunedinPACNI model developed in the Dunedin Study were applied to T1-weighted MRI scans collected in the ADNI and UKB datasets to derive DunedinPACNI scores. Those scores were then related to aging-related phenotypes. AL, attachment loss; Apo, apolipoprotein; BMI, body mass index; FEV1, forced expiratory volume in 1 s; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; HbA1c, glycated hemoglobin; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; hsCRP, high sensitivity C-reactive protein; VO2max, maximal oxygen uptake.

Source data

We trained an elastic net regression model to predict the longitudinal Pace of Aging measure using T1-weighted MRI scans collected in a subsample of 860 Dunedin Study members when they were 45 years old. This subsample maintains the population representativeness of the full cohort (Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2). Specifically, the elastic net regression model used 315 MRI-derived structural measures for each study member, including regional cortical thickness (CT), surface area (SA), gray matter volume (GMV) and gray:white signal intensity ratio (GWR), as well as subcortical gray matter and ventricular volumes36. We performed tenfold cross-validation to identify the optimal tuning parameters37. This optimized model was used to create DunedinPACNI.

The in-sample correlation between DunedinPACNI and the longitudinal Pace of Aging was r = 0.60 (Fig. 2a). We performed a cross-validation analysis by splitting the sample into training and testing subsets 100 different times. Each time, we used 90% of the sample for training and held out the remaining 10% for testing. Across all 100 different splits, the average correlation between DunedinPACNI and Pace of Aging in the testing sample was r = 0.42. This prediction accuracy is in line with next-generation epigenetic biomarkers of aging15,20,38. For both DunedinPACNI and the longitudinal Pace of Aging, higher scores indicate faster aging. Note that DunedinPACNI is a quantitative variable that indexes relative differences between people without clear units. For this reason, we restricted our interpretation to directional comparisons within studies. Associations between faster DunedinPACNI scores and measures of physical functioning, cognitive functioning and facial aging were similar to those previously observed with Pace of Aging2. In these analyses, we controlled for sex but not age because all Dunedin Study members have the same chronological age. The DunedinPACNI effect sizes for 12 of the 15 measures were within the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the original Pace of Aging (Fig. 2b; full results in Supplementary Table 1). This was expected given the high internal correlation between DunedinPACNI and Pace of Aging. Dunedin Study members with faster DunedinPACNI scores had worse balance, slower gait, weaker lower-body and upper-body strength, and poorer coordination; they also reported worse health and more physical limitations; performed more poorly on tests of cognitive functioning; experienced greater childhood-to-adulthood cognitive decline; and looked older. These results indicate that DunedinPACNI accurately estimates the longitudinal Pace of Aging in the Dunedin Study dataset.

Of the 315 brain features used in model training, 216 were set equal to zero because of the high correlation between brain measures and to reduce overfitting. The 99 features included in the final model are visualized in Supplementary Fig. 1. Warmer colors represent features that positively covaried with DunedinPACNI scores (that is, a larger value indicates faster aging), while cooler colors represent features that negatively covaried with DunedinPACNI scores (that is, a larger value indicates slower aging). Features that did not contribute to the estimation of DunedinPACNI predictions are shown in gray. CC, corpus callosum; DC, diencephalon; IQ, intelligence quotient; L, left; R, right.

The optimized model used to derive DunedinPACNI included 99 regional brain measures. Because of difficulties in interpreting multivariable model coefficients, we used the Haufe transformation to estimate feature importance scores from the covariance between each brain measure and Pace of Aging39. Given that many of the MRI-derived measures are highly correlated, our elastic net model reduced overfitting by setting the weights for many of them to zero (visualized in Supplementary Fig. 1). Faster Pace of Aging covaried with thinner cortex, smaller cortical SA, smaller cortical GMV, lower cortical GWR, smaller subcortical GMV and larger ventricular volumes (Fig. 2c). We also observed positive covariance between calcarine CT and GWR, although not calcarine GMV. This is probably due to known aging-related effects on gray and white matter signal intensity that have been demonstrated previously40,41,42,43. These structural features overlap with the MRI signatures of both normal brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases44,45,46,47,48, suggesting that faster DunedinPACNI reflects, at least in part, canonical patterns of brain aging.

If DunedinPACNI is to be used as a measure of aging, it must exhibit sufficient measurement reliability when exported to new datasets. We used test–retest MRI data (n = 45) from the HCP49 to estimate the reliability of DunedinPACNI. The test–retest reliability was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.89 to 0.97; Supplementary Fig. 2).

Having established both internal validity and test–retest reliability, we sought to examine whether DunedinPACNI generalizes to new datasets to detect aging-related outcomes. Specifically, we first tested for associations with cognitive impairment in ADNI and cognitive functioning in UKB. We generated DunedinPACNI scores from T1-weighted MRI scans collected in 1,737 ADNI participants (mean age = 74.3 years, s.d. = 7.2, range = 52–97 years) and 42,583 UKB participants (mean age = 64.4 years, s.d. = 12.7, range = 44–82 years). In ADNI, participants with faster DunedinPACNI showed greater impairment on mental status examinations used to screen for dementia, as well as tests of memory, psychomotor speed and executive functioning. They also reported more impairment in cognitively demanding activities of daily living (ADLs), such as maintaining finances or preparing a meal (Fig. 3a). Absolute standardized effect sizes across all cognitive measures in ADNI ranged from β = 0.18 to 0.39 (all P < 0.001; full results in Supplementary Table 2). Similarly, UKB participants with faster DunedinPACNI performed more poorly on tests of executive functioning and psychomotor speed (Fig. 3b). Absolute standardized effect sizes across all cognitive measures in UKB ranged from β = 0.05 to 0.12 (all P < 0.001; full results in Supplementary Table 3). Associations in UKB were not driven by individuals with early cognitive decline or APOE ε4 homozygotes, who have heightened genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease and show earlier onset of cognitive decline50 (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4). These, and all subsequent analyses presented in this article, control for sex and chronological age.

We next tested if DunedinPACNI differentiates between normal and clinically impaired cognitive functioning in ADNI (Fig. 3c). Participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) had faster DunedinPACNI compared to cognitively normal (CN) participants (β = 0.27, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.18 to 0.35). Participants with dementia had faster DunedinPACNI than both participants with MCI (β = 0.54, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.43 to 0.65) and CN participants (β = 0.81, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.69 to 0.92).

We further tested whether DunedinPACNI predicts future cognitive decline in people without cognitive impairment. Specifically, we analyzed a subsample of 624 ADNI participants who were CN at the time of their first scan (mean age = 72.4 years, s.d. = 6.3 years, range = 52.7–89.9 years), 112 of whom converted to either MCI or dementia during up to 16 years of follow-up (mean follow-up = 4.90 years). CN participants with faster DunedinPACNI at baseline were more likely to develop MCI or dementia and to do so earlier during the follow-up window (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.49, P = 0.005, 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.97; Fig. 3d), meaning that those in the top 10% had a 61% increased risk of developing MCI or dementia compared to participants with an average DunedinPACNI. We conducted a similar analysis in the 701 participants who were diagnosed with MCI at the time of their first scan (mean age = 72.8 years, s.d. = 7.3 years, range = 55.0–88.8 years), 271 of whom converted to dementia during up to 16 years of follow-up (mean follow-up = 4.10 years). Participants with MCI with faster DunedinPACNI at baseline were more likely to convert to dementia (HR = 1.44, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 1.26 to 1.65). These effect sizes were similar when controlling for the number of APOE ε4 alleles, a well-established genetic risk allele for sporadic, late-onset AD (baseline CN: HR = 1.49, P = 0.005, 95% CI = 1.13 to 1.96; baseline MCI: HR = 1.42, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 1.23 to 1.62). Because only a very small number of UKB participants with MRI data received diagnoses of dementia during the follow-up observation (n = 73), we were underpowered to report parallel results in this dataset.

As an estimate of how fast a person is aging, DunedinPACNI should reflect longitudinal trajectories of brain decline33. We tested whether faster baseline DunedinPACNI predicted accelerated hippocampal atrophy, which is an established risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia onset in older adults51. Specifically, we computed longitudinal trajectories of hippocampal atrophy among 1,302 ADNI participants who had MRI data at multiple time points (average number of scans = 4.4, range = 2–13 scans) as well as 4,601 UKB participants who had MRI data at two time points (Fig. 4a). Participants with faster baseline DunedinPACNI exhibited accelerated hippocampal atrophy in both ADNI (β = −0.15, P < 0.001, 95% CI = −0.21 to −0.10; Fig. 4b) and UKB (β = −0.09, P < 0.001, 95% CI = −0.12 to −0.05; Fig. 4b). This result was consistent while controlling for number of APOE ε4 alleles (Supplementary Table 5).

As a measure of aging derived from longitudinal assessments of multiple biomarkers, DunedinPACNI should capture instances of declining health across all organ systems, not just the brain. To test this hypothesis, we used UKB to map DunedinPACNI scores onto measures of frailty, subjective overall health, incident aging-related chronic diseases and all-cause mortality.

We used the Fried Frailty Index to quantify the degree of vulnerability to common stressors associated with aging-related decline in energy reserves and functioning. When treating index scores as a continuous measure ranging from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater frailty52,53, we found that participants with faster DunedinPACNI were frailer (n = 42,583; β = 0.17, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.16 to 0.18). Participants with faster DunedinPACNI also self-reported poorer overall health (n = 42,235; β = −0.17, P < 0.001, 95% CI = −0.18 to −0.16; Fig. 5a), which predicts mortality even independently of objective health measures54. These associations were not driven by individuals with early cognitive decline or high genetic risk for AD (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4).

Similar patterns emerged when considering clinical diagnoses of chronic aging-related diseases, including myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia and stroke. Participants with a lifetime prevalence of one of these chronic diseases had faster DunedinPACNI compared to those with no diagnoses (β = 0.19, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.16 to 0.23). Participants with a lifetime prevalence of two or more chronic diseases had faster DunedinPACNI than those with a single chronic disease (β = 0.25, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.12 to 0.38) and those with no chronic disease (β = 0.44, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.31 to 0.57; Fig. 5b).

Extending beyond contemporaneous associations, we assessed whether faster DunedinPACNI at baseline predicted future myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia or stroke in UKB participants who were diagnosis-free at the time of scanning (n = 40,753). A total of 827 participants reported a new diagnosis of at least one of these aging-related chronic diseases over a maximum follow-up period of 9.7 years after scanning (that is, baseline). Consistent with the contemporaneous associations, healthy participants with faster DunedinPACNI at baseline were more likely to be later diagnosed with chronic aging-related diseases (HR = 1.14, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.23; Fig. 5c), that is, those in the top 10% had an 18% or greater increased risk of developing a chronic disease compared to participants with average DunedinPACNI. These associations were not driven by individuals with early cognitive decline or high genetic risk for AD (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4).

Given the increased mortality rates among people with chronic aging-related diseases, we asked if baseline DunedinPACNI scores predicted all-cause mortality. Of the 42,583 UKB participants included in our dataset, 757 died over the follow-up period after their baseline MRI scan. Participants with faster baseline DunedinPACNI scores died earlier (HR = 1.32, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 1.22 to 1.43; Fig. 5d), that is, those in the top 10% were at least 41% more likely to die compared to participants with average DunedinPACNI. These associations were not driven by individuals with early cognitive decline or high genetic risk for AD (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4). Taken together, these findings suggest that DunedinPACNI is useful for gauging general physical health and assessing the risk for future chronic disease and death.

People who are less advantaged in their socioeconomic position experience a wide range of chronic diseases and earlier mortality55,56,57; DunedinPACNI should reflect such gradients of health inequities. We used information about educational attainment and income to test this prediction. Faster DunedinPACNI was observed for participants who either had fewer years of formal education (ADNI: β = −0.10, P < 0.001, 95% CI = −0.15 to −0.05]; UK Biobank: β = −0.09, P < 0.001, 95% CI = −0.10 to −0.08) or lower income (UKB: β = −0.06, P < 0.001, 95% CI = −0.07 to −0.05), reflecting the expected socioeconomic health gradient (Fig. 5e,f). These associations were not driven by individuals with early cognitive decline or high genetic risk for AD (Extended Data Fig. 3).

Brain-based predictive algorithms often fail when applied to groups that demographically differ from the training sample58. Most cognitive and brain aging studies are collected in high-income countries in North America and Europe; this may limit the generalizability of brain-based models to people in low-income and middle-income countries59,60,61. Latin Americans are underrepresented in biomedical research60,62 and may experience distinct social and environmental influences on brain aging compared to people in high-income countries in North America and Europe60. To test the generalizability of DunedinPACNI in Latin Americans, we calculated DunedinPACNI scores in a sample of 369 adults from Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru from the BrainLat dataset63. A total of 162 BrainLat participants were diagnosed with AD, 84 were diagnosed with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and 123 were healthy controls. When controlling for age and sex, BrainLat participants with AD and FTD had faster DunedinPACNI scores compared to healthy controls (AD: β = 0.70, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.48 to 0.91; FTD: β = 0.79, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.55 to 1.04; Fig. 6a). Notably, these effect sizes are comparable to the difference between participants with dementia and CN participants in ADNI (Fig. 6b). In addition, 191 BrainLat participants also completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). In this subset, BrainLat participants with faster DunedinPACNI scores had poorer scores on the MoCA (β = −0.35, P < 0.001, 95% CI = −0.49 to −0.20). Notably, this effect was similar to the association between DunedinPACNI and MoCA scores in ADNI participants (β = −0.32, P < 0.001, 95% CI = −0.38 to −0.25; Fig. 6c).

The linear associations between MoCA scores and DunedinPACNI scores were similar in a sample of Latin Americans (BrainLat) and North Americans (ADNI).

Lastly, we compared DunedinPACNI with existing approaches for measuring aging using brain MRI data. Specifically, we compared the effect sizes for DunedinPACNI from all of the aforementioned analyses in ADNI, UKB and BrainLat with brain age gap generated using brainageR34. We selected this algorithm because of its high accuracy and test–retest reliability compared to other brain age gap algorithms64. DunedinPACNI and brain age gap were only modestly correlated (ADNI: r = 0.17, P < 0.001; UKB: r = 0.31, P < 0.001; BrainLat: r = 0.32, P < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 3). Compared to brain age gap, the effect sizes for DunedinPACNI were similar or larger across measures of cognitive function, cognitive decline, brain atrophy, frailty, disease risk, mortality and socioeconomic health gradients (Fig. 7 and Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6; full results are shown in Supplementary Tables 2, 3 and 6–11). Commensurate with the low correlation between these measures, when we included both DunedinPACNI and brain age gap in a single model, each measure explained unique variance in clinical outcomes, with only minor reductions in effect sizes. Moreover, using both DunedinPACNI and brain age gap together in a single model generally increased the prediction of these outcomes (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6). For example, the combined HR of DunedinPACNI and brain age gap predicting mortality risk was 1.50 (95% CI = 1.36 to 1.65), compared to the independent HRs of 1.32 for DunedinPACNI and 1.24 for brain age gap.

Note that for visualization, the signs of some outcomes were flipped, such that higher scores for all outcomes reflected worse performance or health. Raw effect sizes are presented in Supplementary Tables 2, 3, 7 and 9. b, Forest plots of DunedinPACNI and brain age gap HRs in ADNI and UKB.

Source data

In addition, we investigated how DunedinPACNI differs from commonly reported MRI-based measures of brain aging, namely hippocampal volume and ventricular volume. To test this, we compared the effect sizes for DunedinPACNI with the effect sizes for bilateral hippocampal volume and bilateral ventricular volume in UKB and in CN participants in ADNI. In both datasets, we observed that a faster DunedinPACNI was generally more strongly and more consistently associated with poor cognition, poor health and frailty, as well as risk of dementia, disease and mortality. Furthermore, DunedinPACNI explained incremental variance in these outcomes over and above hippocampal volume and ventricular volume alone (Extended Data Figs. 7–9 and Supplementary Tables 12–14).

DunedinPACNI is an accurate and reliable measure of how fast a person is aging derived from a single brain MRI scan. Using 50,106 scans from people ranging from 22 to 98 years old across the HCP, ADNI, UKB and BrainLat datasets, we demonstrate that people with faster DunedinPACNI had not only worse cognitive and brain health (that is, poorer cognition, faster hippocampal atrophy and greater dementia risk) but also worse general health (that is, greater frailty, poorer self-reported health, greater risk of chronic disease and mortality). This indicates that patterns of aging detected during midlife are clinically useful among people in advanced age, including people with neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, DunedinPACNI showed evidence of generalization to a sample of Latin American adults with and without dementia. Across all analyses, the effect sizes for DunedinPACNI were similar or larger than the effect sizes for brain age gap, an existing age deviation measure estimated using the same structural MRI data. Moreover, DunedinPACNI and brain age gap were only weakly correlated, and DunedinPACNI accounted for incremental variance in aging-related health outcomes. While weak correlations between neuroimaging-based measures of aging may appear surprising, they mirror findings that different epigenetic clocks are also weakly correlated, and that multiple clocks are useful for predicting disease and death65,66. It is possible that biomarkers of aging trained in midlife samples more closely detect the earlier stages of aging compared to biomarkers of aging trained in samples of advanced age. This may partially explain the modest correlations observed between aging biomarkers. Aging remains a construct in search of measurement tools4,5, and DunedinPACNI represents a next-generation measure of aging that is distinct from existing approaches.

DunedinPACNI is not without limitations. First, the Dunedin Study, ADNI and UKB consist of data collected primarily from participants of European ancestry. Furthermore, ADNI and UKB oversample participants from higher socioeconomic backgrounds67. There is growing awareness that lack of representativeness in neuroimaging research may hinder clinical translation68,69, including clinical translation of brain-based predictive models58. To address this, we replicated associations with DunedinPACNI in a sample of Latin Americans, as well as low-income and non-White UKB participants. (Supplementary Tables 15 and 16). Additionally, our findings in ADNI, UKB and BrainLat demonstrate that DunedinPACNI generalizes well to older adults. This suggests that early differences in aging can be detected in brain MRI measures collected at age 45 years that are clinically useful in people who are decades older. At the same time, it is also possible that an analogous aging biomarker trained in older adults may generalize more readily to other samples of older adults. A priority for future work is to further evaluate the generalizability of DunedinPACNI to people of diverse demographics and backgrounds. Second, DunedinPACNI only uses structural brain measures derived from a T1-weighted MRI scan. We chose this strategy because these scans are collected in nearly every MRI study, thereby maximizing the potential adoption of DunedinPACNI. It is possible that the performance accuracy reported in this study could be improved by including additional structural or functional MRI measures (for example, white matter microstructural integrity from diffusion-weighted images, blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal from T2*-weighted images). Relatedly, while elastic net is widely used to measure biological age11,12,15,16,20, future research should evaluate whether predictive performance accuracy could be increased by more complex, nonlinear models. Third, by design, DunedinPACNI is a measure of the longitudinal rate of the aging of the body derived from a single MRI scan and is not designed to replace longitudinal measurement of brain aging through repeated MRI assessments. Fourth, DunedinPACNI is estimated through observed correlations between measures of brain structure and longitudinal aging, which could reflect multiple causal pathways. For example, faster aging of non-brain organs might cause poorer brain health or vice versa. Alternatively, both may be driven by a third factor. Fifth, although we found robust associations with aging phenotypes across both ADNI and UKB, we generally observed larger effect sizes in ADNI. This could suggest that DunedinPACNI is sensitive to dysfunction in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases. Further evaluation is needed to establish the degree to which DunedinPACNI is sensitive to individual organ systems. Sixth, DunedinPACNI is currently a quantitative tool for comparison of individuals within datasets but not between datasets. Future research, potentially through data harmonization and normative modeling approaches, should establish normative reference values and ranges that can aid in the clinical interpretation of DunedinPACNI scores. Seventh, as is true for all MRI-based measurements, the derivation of DunedinPACNI may be compromised in low-quality scans, such as those with high levels of head motion. In the analyses presented in this study, we followed standard practice by excluding low-quality scans (Supplementary Figs. 4–7). Future research should adopt methods to improve data quality in high-motion participants to help maximize generalizability70,71.

Currently, DunedinPACNI and general aging biomarkers are research tools that require further validation before potential translation to the clinic5. Nonetheless, we believe that DunedinPACNI and other biomarkers of general aging have several promising uses that differ from, and are complementary to, biomarkers of specific diseases (for example, hippocampal atrophy and AD72 or high blood pressure and stroke73). For example, biomarkers of general aging could help identify a broad risk for many age-related diseases earlier in the lifespan, when individuals may benefit most from health and antiaging intervention23. Biomarkers of general aging could also help establish a person's prognosis after the onset of a specific disease or establish how interventions or insults may change how fast a person is aging25,74,75. Lastly, biomarkers of general aging are necessary to mechanistically link exposures (for example, low socioeconomic status) to aging or to link the rate of aging to outcomes such as increased disease risk4. While detecting or diagnosing a specific disease requires a proximal, specific biomarker of that disease, biomarkers of general aging could be used to measure the distal risk for a broad array of diseases. This difference allows for clinical applications of biomarkers of aging such as DunedinPACNI alongside biomarkers of specific diseases.

Several unique features of the Dunedin Study contribute advantages to DunedinPACNI compared to other biomarkers of aging. First, DunedinPACNI was developed in a cohort of people all born in the same year and studied at the same ages throughout their lives, thereby avoiding biases that are introduced by differences in historical exposures across generations and across time. Second, DunedinPACNI was trained on 19 biomarkers that were each assessed over nearly two decades and thus are not influenced by short-term illnesses that can cause aberrant biomarker signals at a single assessment. Third, DunedinPACNI was derived from participants followed from birth to age 45 years—before the onset of chronic, aging-related diseases that cause divergence from typical trajectories of aging. Other biomarkers of aging are typically derived from multiage samples in which many of the older members already have chronic diseases that have altered their body and brain, so those measures may inadvertently repackage disease instead of aging. Fourth, because the Dunedin Study cohort is a population representative cohort with very low attrition and mortality rates, DunedinPACNI does not suffer from oversampling of healthy volunteers, attrition bias (that is, people with worse health being more likely to drop out) or survivor bias (that is, people with worse health dying earlier). Indeed, our results align with prior research showing that DunedinPACE, which like DunedinPACNI was trained on the longitudinal Pace of Aging, is associated with dementia, morbidity and mortality20,22,23. Our results, alongside the fast-growing literature on DunedinPACE, suggest that these unique design characteristics of the Dunedin Study make it a powerful training sample for longitudinal biomarkers of aging.

The scope of geroscience has rapidly expanded with the proliferation of omic clocks that can measure how fast people age10. DunedinPACNI is poised to further this growth by allowing individual differences in the rate of longitudinal aging to be estimated from a single noninvasive MRI scan that can be collected in just a few minutes. Indeed, the requisite MRI data to estimate DunedinPACNI have already been collected in many psychiatric, neurological and brain health cohorts, from tens of thousands of research participants across the lifespan and around the world. DunedinPACNI offers an opportunity to enrich such studies and deepen our understanding of the causes of individual differences in the rate of longitudinal aging, including genetics76, childhood adversities77, environmental exposures (for example, lead78,79) and lifestyle factors (for example, physical inactivity, social isolation80). DunedinPACNI may also be adopted as a surrogate endpoint to accelerate our ability to develop, prioritize and evaluate potential antiaging interventions that slow aging and prevent disease81,82. The algorithm for DunedinPACNI is publicly available to the research community to facilitate these and other future research directions (https://github.com/etw11/DunedinPACNI).

This research complies with all relevant ethical regulations; all study protocols were approved by the relevant ethical review boards. The specific ethical review boards are detailed in the description of each dataset. The premise and analysis plan for this study were preregistered (https://rb.gy/b9x4u6). All analyses and code were checked for accuracy by an independent analyst. Analyses were conducted on data collected through the Dunedin Study, HCP, ADNI, UKB and BrainLat. The details of each study and dataset are described below.

Participants are members of the Dunedin Study, a longitudinal investigation of health and behavior in a population-representative birth cohort. The 1,037 participants (91% of eligible births, 48% female) were all people born between April 1972 and March 1973 in Dunedin, New Zealand, who were residents in the province and who participated in the first assessment at age 3 years19. The cohort represented the full range of socioeconomic status in the general population of New Zealand's South Island and, as adults, matched the New Zealand National Health and Nutrition Survey on key adult health indicators (for example, BMI, smoking and general practitioner visits) and the New Zealand Census of citizens of the same age on educational attainment19,83. Study members are primarily of New Zealand European ethnicity; 8.6% reported Māori ethnicity at age 45 years.

General assessments were performed at birth as well as ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, 26, 32 and 38 years, and most recently (completed April 2019) at age 45 years, when 938 of the 997 living study members (94.1%) participated. At each assessment, study members were brought to the Dunedin Study Research Unit at the University of Otago for interviews and examinations. In addition, staff provided standardized ratings; informant questionnaires were sent to people who the study members nominated as people who knew them well, and administrative records were searched. The Dunedin Study was approved by the University of Otago Ethics Committee and study members gave written informed consent before participating.

As a component of the assessments at age 45 years, study members were scanned using a Siemens MAGNETOM Skyra (Siemens Healthineers) 3T scanner equipped with a 64-channel head/neck coil at the Pacific Radiology Group imaging center in Dunedin, New Zealand. High-resolution T1-weighted images were obtained using an MP-RAGE sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2,400 ms; echo time (TE) = 1.98 ms; 208 sagittal slices; flip angle, 9°; field of view (FOV), 224 mm; matrix = 256 × 256 px; slice thickness = 0.9 mm with no gap (voxel size 0.9 × 0.875 × 0.875 mm); and total scan time = 6 min and 52 s. Three-dimensional (3D) fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images were obtained with the following parameters: TR = 8,000 ms; TE = 399 ms; 160 sagittal slices; FOV = 240 mm; matrix = 232 × 256 px; slice thickness = 1.2 mm (voxel size 0.9 × 0.9 × 1.2 mm); and total scan time = 5 min and 38 s. Additionally, a gradient echo field map was acquired with the following parameters: TR = 712 ms; TE = 4.92 and 7.38 ms; 72 axial slices; FOV = 200 mm; matrix = 100 × 100 px; slice thickness = 2.0 mm (voxel size 2 mm isotropic); and total scan time = 2 min and 25 s. Of the 938 study members seen at phase 45, 63 declined to participate in MRI scanning, that is, 875 study members completed the MRI scanning protocol. Scanned study members did not differ from other living participants in terms of childhood neurocognitive functioning or childhood socioeconomic status (see the attrition analysis in Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2). Of these 875 study members for whom data was available, four were excluded because of major incidental findings or previous injuries (for example, large tumors or extensive damage to the brain or skull), nine because of missing FLAIR or field map scans, one because of poor surface mapping yielding and one because of missing the Pace of Aging variable. This yielded a final training sample of 860 study members (see Supplementary Fig. 4 for the inclusion details).

Structural MRI data were processed using FreeSurfer v.6.0 (ref. 36). Specifically, T1-weighted images were processed and refined with 3D FLAIR images using the recon-all pipeline.

Participants' pace of biological aging was measured as changes in 19 biomarkers of study members' cardiovascular, metabolic, pulmonary, kidney, immune and dental systems across ages 26, 32, 38 and 45 years. This measure quantifies participants' rate of aging in year-equivalent units of physiological decline per chronological year. The average participant experienced 1 year of physiological decline per year, that is, a mean (s.d.) Pace of Aging of 1 (0.3)2. See the ‘Statistical analysis' section for more details.

One-legged balance was measured using the unipedal stance test as the maximum time achieved across three trials of the test with eyes closed84,85,86. Gait speed (meters per second) was assessed with the 6-m-long GAITRite Electronic Walkway (CIR Systems) with 2-m acceleration and 2-m deceleration before and after the walkway, respectively. Gait speed was assessed under three walking conditions: usual gait speed (walk at a normal pace from a standing start, measured as a mean of two walks) and two challenge paradigms, dual-task gait speed (walk at a normal pace while reciting alternate letters of the alphabet out loud, starting with the letter ‘A', measured as a mean of two walks) and maximum gait speed (walk as fast as safely possible, measured as a mean of three walks). Gait speed was correlated across the three walk conditions87. To increase reliability and take advantage of the variation in all three walk conditions (usual gait and the two challenge paradigms), we calculated the mean of the three highly correlated individual walk conditions to generate our primary measure of composite gait speed. The step in place test was measured as the number of times the right knee was lifted to mid-thigh height (measured as the height half-way between the knee cap and the iliac crest) in 2 min at a self-directed pace88,89. Chair rises were measured as the number of stands with no hands completed in 30 s from a seated position88,90. Handgrip strength was measured for each hand (elbow held at 90°, upper arm held tight against the trunk) as the maximum value achieved across three trials using a Jamar digital dynamometer91,92. Analyses using handgrip strength controlled for BMI. Visuomotor coordination was measured as the time to completion of the grooved pegboard test. Scores were reversed so that higher values corresponded to better performance. Physical limitations were measured with the RAND 36-Item Health Survey 1.0 physical functioning scale. Responses (‘limited a lot', ‘limited a little', ‘not limited at all') assessed difficulty with completing several activities (for example, climbing several flights of stairs, walking more than 1 km, participating in strenuous sports). Scores were reversed to reflect physical limitations so that a high score indicates more limitations.

We obtained reports about study members' health and age appearance from three sources: self-reports; informant impressions; and staff impressions. For self-reports, we asked study members about their own impressions of how old they looked: ‘Do you think you look older, younger, or about your actual age?' Response options were younger than their age, about their actual age, or older than their age. We also asked study members to rate their age perceptions in years: ‘How old do you feel?' For informant impressions, informants who knew a study member well (94% response rate) were asked: ‘Compared to others their age, do you think they (the study member) look younger or older than others their age? Response options were: ‘much younger', ‘a bit younger', ‘about the same', ‘a bit older' or ‘much older'. For staff impressions, four members of the Dunedin Study unit staff completed a brief questionnaire describing each study member. To assess age appearance, staff used a seven-item scale to assign a ‘relative age' to each study member (1 = young-looking, 7 = old-looking). Correlations between self-ratings, informant ratings and staff ratings ranged from 0.34 to 0.52. All reporters rated the study member's general health using the following response options: excellent, very good, good, fair or poor. Correlations between self-ratings, informant ratings and staff ratings ranged from r = 0.48 to r = 0.55.

The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition was administered at age 45 years, yielding the adult IQ. In addition to full-scale IQ, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition yields indexes of four specific cognitive functional domains: processing speed; working memory; perceptual reasoning; and verbal comprehension. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised was administered at ages 7, 9 and 11 years. To increase the baseline reliability, the three scores were averaged, yielding the childhood IQ. We measured cognitive decline by studying adult IQ scores after controlling for childhood IQ scores. We focused on change in overall IQ given evidence that aging-related slopes are correlated across all cognitive functions, indicating that research on cognitive decline may be best focused on a highly reliable summary index, rather than focused on individual functions93.

Facial age was based on two measurements of perceived age by an independent panel of eight people. First, age range was assessed by an independent panel of four raters, who were presented with standardized (non-smiling) digital facial photographs of study members when they were 45 years old. Raters, who were kept blind to the actual age of study members, used a Likert scale to categorize each study member into a 5-year age range (that is, from 20 to 24 years old and up to 70+ years old). Interrater reliability was 0.77. The scores for each study member were averaged across all raters. Second, relative age was assessed by a different panel of four raters, who were told that all photos were of people aged 45 years old. These raters then used a 7-item Likert scale to assign a ‘relative age' to each participant (that is, 1 = ‘young-looking' to 7 = ‘old-looking'). Interrater reliability was 0.79. The measure of perceived age at 45 years (that is, facial age) was derived by standardizing and averaging age range and relative age scores.

The HCP is a publicly available dataset that includes 1,206 participants with extensive MRI data49. HCP data access is managed by the WU-Minn HCP consortium. All participants provided written informed consent. Specifically, we used data from 45 participants who completed the scan protocol a second time (with a mean interval between scans of approximately 140 days) allowing for the calculation of test–retest reliability. All participants were free of current psychiatric or neurological illness and were between 25 and 35 years of age. The mean age of the HCP test–retest sample analyzed was 30.3 years (s.d. = 3.3 years, range = 22–35 years) at the first time point.

Structural MRI data were analyzed using the HCP minimal preprocessing pipeline94. Briefly, T1-weighted images were processed using a custom FreeSurfer recon-all pipeline optimized for structural MRI with a higher resolution than 1 mm isotropic. Details on HCP MRI data acquisition have been described elsewhere94.

The primary goal of ADNI is to test whether serial MRI, positron emission tomography, other biological markers and clinical and neuropsychological assessments can be combined to measure the progression of neurodegeneration in participants with MCI, AD and CN older adults (adni.loni.usc.edu)95. Cognitive and diagnostic data were downloaded on 12 June 2022. MRI data curated from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project collection were downloaded on 7 December 2023. ADNI was approved by the institutional review boards of all the participating institutions. All participants provided written informed consent. The ADNI sample demographic information can be found in Supplementary Table 17.

T1-weighted scans were collected using either 1.5T or 3T scanners. MRI acquisition parameters varied across ADNI sites and waves; however, the targets for acquisition were isotropic 1-mm3 voxels96. Raw T1-weighted images were processed using longitudinal FreeSurfer v.6.0. Scans were excluded for low quality if they did not have a quality control rating of ‘pass' from the ADNI investigators or if segmentation failed visual inspection. Scans were also excluded if participants were missing demographic data, such as age, sex or diagnosis (Supplementary Fig. 5). Further details on the MRI methods in ADNI can be found at adni.loni.usc.edu.

ADNI participants completed several cognitive and behavioral assessments at the time of scanning. The ADAS-Cog is a structured scale that evaluates memory, reasoning, language, orientation, ideational praxis and constructional praxis97. Delayed word recall and number cancellation are included in addition to the 11 standard ADAS items98. The test is scored for errors, ranging from 0 (best performance) to 85 (worst performance). The MMSE is a screening instrument that evaluates orientation, memory, attention, concentration, naming, repetition and comprehension, and ability to create a sentence and to copy two overlapping pentagons99. The MMSE is scored as the number of correctly completed items ranging from 0 (worst performance) to 30 (best performance). The MoCA is designed to detect people at the MCI stage of cognitive dysfunction100. The scale ranges from 0 (worst performance) to 30 (best performance). The RAVLT is a list learning task that assesses learning and memory. On each of five learning trials, 15 unrelated nouns are presented orally at the rate of one word per second and immediate free recall of the words is elicited. After a 30-min delay filled with unrelated testing, free recall of the original 15-word list is elicited. Both immediate recall and percentage forgotten are used. The LogMem tests I and II (delayed paragraph recall) are from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised. Free recall of one short story is elicited immediately after being read aloud to the participant and again after a 30-min delay. The total bits of information recalled after the delay interval (maximum score = 25) are analyzed. The Trail Making Test, Part B, consists of 25 circles, either numbered (one through 13) or containing letters (A through L). Participants connect the circles while alternating between numbers and letters (for example, A to 1, 1 to B, B to 2, 2 to C). Time to complete (300 s maximum) is the primary measure of interest. The FAQ is a self-report measure of instrumental ADLs, such as preparing meals, performing chores, keeping a schedule and traveling outside of one's neighborhood101. Each unique cognitive testing measure was paired with the participant's most temporally proximate brain scan within 6 months of cognitive testing.

ADNI participants were classified into CN, MCI or dementia groups by ADNI study physicians based on subjective memory complaints, multiple neurocognitive and behavioral assessment scores, and level of impairment in ADLs. Complete diagnostic criteria can be found at adni.loni.usc.edu. Each individual scan was categorized according to the most temporally proximate cognitive diagnosis received by that participant.

Education level was measured according to self-reported years of education. For the purposes of visualization in Fig. 5e, participants were grouped according to the following thresholds: less than high school: <12 years; high school: 12 years; some college: 12–15 years; college: 16 years; more than college: >16 years.

UKB is a UK population-based prospective study of 502,486 participants between the ages of 40 and 69 at baseline assessment102. We analyzed data from 42,583 participants who underwent brain MRI. The data used in these analyses were downloaded in April 2023. UKB was approved by the North West Multi-centre for Research Ethics Committee. All participants provided written informed consent. UKB sample demographic information can be found in Supplementary Table 17.

MRI methods for UKB have been described in detail elsewhere103. Briefly, MRI data were collected using three identical 3T Siemens Skyra scanners with a 32-channel Siemens head coil. T1-weighted images were obtained using a 3D MP-RAGE with the following parameters: TR = 2,000 ms; inversion time = 880 ms; 208 sagittal slices, matrix = 256 × 256 px; slice thickness = 1 mm with no gap; and total scan time = 4 min and 52 s. Our study made use of imaging-derived phenotypes generated using an image-processing pipeline developed and run on behalf of UKB103. As part of this pipeline, raw T1-weighted images were processed using the cross-sectional FreeSurfer v.6.0. All brain measures used in the cross-sectional analyses presented in this study were derived from the outputs of this FreeSurfer pipeline. We excluded UKB participants with a very low signal-to-noise ratio and highly unusual summary morphometrics indicative of low-quality reconstruction (Supplementary Fig. 6).

To measure change in hippocampal volume in the subset of UKB participants with longitudinal MRI data, we reprocessed all T1-weighted images for this subset of participants using the longitudinal FreeSurfer v.6.0 pipeline104. This allowed us to avoid the known biases that can be introduced by different processing stages of the longitudinal pipeline in different hardware and software environments. Specifically, we reprocessed both time points of each participant's T1-weighted scans with the cross-sectional recon-all pipeline105. Then, we built an unbiased within-participant template106 using robust, inverse, consistent registration107 and reprocessed each T1-weighted scan through the automated longitudinal pipeline104.

UKB participants completed a battery of cognitive tests at the time of MRI. We investigated cognitive functioning using the following measures: Reaction Time (field ID = 20023), Fluid Intelligence (field ID = 20016), Numeric Memory (field ID = 4282), Trail A (field ID = 6348) and Trail B (field ID = 6350), symbol digit substitution (field ID = 23324), Tower Rearranging (field ID = 21004) and Matrix Completion (field ID = 6373). The details of these cognitive tests have been described elsewhere108.

To further investigate aging-related health, we used the Fried Frailty Index53. Briefly, the Fried Frailty Index is based on meeting the criteria for declining functioning across five domains: unintentional weight loss; exhaustion; weakness; physical inactivity; and slow walking speed. Index scores range from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater frailty109. During their imaging visit, UKB participants were also asked to rate their overall health as ‘poor', ‘fair', ‘good' or ‘excellent'. We used these ratings to investigate self-reported overall health (field ID = 2178).

To assess the influence of DunedinPACNI on aging-related disease and mortality risk in UKB, we used variables from algorithmically defined health outcomes. Briefly, algorithmically defined outcomes are generated by combining information from baseline assessments (self-reported medical conditions, operations and medications) with linked data from hospital admissions and death registries. Because of the relatively small number of aging-related disease diagnoses at the follow-up, we defined aging-related morbidity as being diagnosed with myocardial infarction (field ID = 42000), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (field ID = 42016), dementia (field ID = 42018) or stroke (field ID = 42006). Furthermore, we defined the risk of chronic disease as the emergence of one or more of these diagnoses among participants who were healthy at the time of scanning (that is, baseline). Mortality was quantified during the follow-up from death records (field ID = 40000).

To test the association between DunedinPACNI and socioeconomic gradients of health, we tested whether UKB participants differed in DunedinPACNI scores as a function of educational attainment and household income. We grouped participants into three categories according to their self-reported educational qualifications (field ID = 6138) following prior work110. Specifically, these groups were: high (college or university degree); medium (A/AS level or equivalent or O level/GCSE or equivalent); and low (none of these). We also tested whether UKB participants differed in DunedinPACNI scores as a function of household income (field ID = 738).

We also conducted sensitivity analyses while restricting the UKB sample to either only low-income or only non-White participants. We considered participants as having a low income if they reported making less than £18,000 per year in household income. We considered participants to be non-White if they did not report their ethnic background (field ID = 21000) as ‘any other White background', ‘British', ‘do not know', ‘Irish', ‘prefer not to answer' or ‘White'.

BrainLat is a multimodal neuroimaging dataset of patients with neurodegenerative diseases and healthy adult controls collected in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru63. We analyzed neuroimaging data from 368 individuals who were either cognitively healthy or diagnosed with AD or behavioral variant FTD. The BrainLat study was approved by the institutional ethical boards of each recruitment site. All participants, or their legal representatives, provided written informed consent. The BrainLat demographic data can be found in Supplementary Table 17.

The MRI methods for BrainLat have been described in detail elsewhere63. Briefly, T1-weighted MP-RAGE scans were collected on either 1.5 or 3T scanners. Acquisition parameters varied across sites, but scans most frequently had isometric 1-mm3 voxels. Scans were downloaded and then processed using FreeSurfer v.6.0. Participants were excluded if they failed the automated FreeSurfer quality metrics or a visual quality check of segmentation output (Supplementary Fig. 7).

All participants included could speak fluent Spanish and had adequate visual and auditory capacity for testing. Participants were classified as CN if they had a modified clinical dementia rating of 0, an MMSE score above 25 and lacked a history of substance abuse, and neurological or psychiatric disorders. Patients were classified into the AD or FTD groups according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke–Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders working group for probable AD or probable behavioral variant FTD. Diagnosis was supported using appropriate MRI or positron emission tomography imaging when needed63.

BrainLat participants were evaluated with the MoCA. The MoCA is designed to detect people at the MCI stage of cognitive dysfunction100. The scale ranges from 0 (worst performance) to 30 (best performance).

The derivation of Pace of Aging has been described elsewhere1,2. Briefly, we measured a panel of the following 19 biomarkers (Fig. 1a) at ages 26, 32, 38, and 45 years: BMI, waist/hip ratio, HbA1c, leptin, blood pressure (mean arterial pressure), cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max), forced vital capacity ratio (FEV1/FVC), FEV1, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, lipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein B100/A1 ratio, eGFR, blood urea nitrogen, hsCRP, white blood cell count, mean periodontal AL and the number of dental-caries-affected tooth surfaces (tooth decay). To calculate each study member's Pace of Aging, we first transformed the biomarker values to a standardized scale. For each biomarker at each wave, we standardized values according to the age 26 distribution. Next, we calculated each study member's slope for each of the 19 biomarkers using a mixed-effects growth model that regressed the biomarker's level on age. Finally, we combined information from the 19 slopes of the biomarkers using a unit-weighting scheme. We calculated each study member's Pace of Aging as the sum of age-dependent annual changes in biomarker z-scores. Biomarker standardization was performed separately for men and women.

A schematic of DunedinPACNI model development can be found in Fig. 1. We trained an elastic net regression model to estimate the Pace of Aging from structural neuroimaging phenotypes in 860 Dunedin Study members at age 45 years (for the attrition analysis and inclusion criteria see Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2 and Supplementary Fig. 4). We selected 315 FreeSurfer measures as predictors from the following categories: regional CT, regional cortical SA, regional cortical GMV, regional cortical GWR and ‘ASEG' volumes (that is, regional subcortical GMV, ventricular volumes and bilateral volume of white matter hypointensities). All cortical data were parcellated according to the Desikan–Killiany Atlas111. Note that although many ADNI scans do not pass quality control (Supplementary Fig. 5), FreeSurfer is a robust segmentation method, especially in healthy individuals112. Four phenotypes from the ‘ASEG' volumes were excluded because of insufficient variance in the Dunedin Study (left and right white matter hypointensities, left and right non-white matter hypointensities). Model training was performed using the caret package in R. We conducted a grid search across a range of α and λ values. We used 100 repetitions of tenfold cross-validation to estimate model performance in held-out participants. The effect of sex was regressed from the Pace of Aging before model training. To prevent information leak during cross-validation, we regressed sex from each training set and applied the resulting β weights to each test set. This approach ensured that our model only used information from the training set, including covariate regression, when calculating predictions in each test set. We selected optimal tuning parameters according to the highest variance explained and lowest mean absolute error. The optimal tuning parameters were α = 0.214 and λ = 0.100. Using these parameters, we fitted the model to the entire n = 860 sample. The raw elastic net regression model weights can be found in Supplementary Table 18.

To generate DunedinPACNI scores in HCP, ADNI, UKB and BrainLat participants, we applied the regression weights from the DunedinPACNI model to FreeSurfer-derived phenotypes in each dataset and summed the products and model intercept. In ADNI, UKB and BrainLat, DunedinPACNI scores were correlated with chronological age (ADNI: r = 0.37; UKB: r = 0.50; BrainLat: r = 0.37; Supplementary Fig. 8).

In addition, we conducted the same procedure again without GWR because this measure is not always distributed in public datasets. We observed slightly reduced model accuracy when GWR was not included. DunedinPACNI estimates without GWR phenotypes showed excellent test–retest reliability in HCP. DunedinPACNI estimates were similar with and without GWR phenotypes in ADNI, UKB and BrainLat (see Supplementary Figs. 2 and 9 for more details).

We submitted raw T1-weighted images from ADNI, UKB and BrainLat to the publicly available brainageR algorithm (v.2.1). This model, which has been described in detail elsewhere113, is trained to predict chronological age in a sample of healthy, cognitively unimpaired individuals aged 18–92 years. This algorithm was selected because it generates highly reliable estimates among published algorithms64. Briefly, brainageR is estimated by first segmenting and normalizing T1-weighted images using SPM12. Next, coefficients derived from a Gaussian process regression model predicting chronological age in a training dataset (n = 2,001) are applied to morphometric features from brain segmentations to predict participants' chronological age. Brain age gap was subsequently estimated by subtracting actual chronological age from predicted age113. Notably, 15 ADNI scans failed the brain age gap pipeline (14 failed visual inspection of segmentation, one error when computing the predicted age). These scans were excluded from all brain age gap analyses, including comparative analyses with DunedinPACNI.

To first test the validity of DunedinPACNI in the Dunedin Study training sample, we tested for linear associations between DunedinPACNI scores and one-legged balance, gait speed, step in place, chair stands, grip strength, visuomotor coordination, subjective physical limitations, subjective health, cognitive function, child-to-adult cognitive decline and facial aging while controlling for sex. We compared these effect sizes to associations between each of these measures and the original, longitudinal Pace of Aging.

We used the HCP dataset to assess the test–retest reliability of DunedinPACNI. Reliability was quantified using a two-way mixed-effects intraclass correlation coefficient (3,1) with session modeled as a fixed effect, participant as a random effect and the test–retest interval as an effect of no interest114.

We first used linear regression models to test for associations between DunedinPACNI and scores on tests of cognition, physical function and health in ADNI and UKB. All analyses controlled for age and sex. In ADNI, we calculated robust standard errors to account for nonindependence from repeated observations. We also tested the standardized differences in DunedinPACNI scores between three groups based on cognitive status: CN, MCI and dementia. All group difference comparisons controlled for age and sex. We again calculated robust standard errors to account for nonindependence and conduced a sensitivity analysis while controlling for APOE ε4 carriership. We repeated these analyses with brain age gap. Notably, when conducting analyses on the combined effects of DunedinPACNI and brain age gap on cognitive outcomes in ADNI, we restricted the sample to the first time point of each measure. These analyses included only one observation per participant, allowing us to more easily combine effect sizes and CIs.

We conducted a Cox proportional hazards regression using the baseline DunedinPACNI scores of ADNI participants to predict their probability of cognitive decline or clinical conversion to dementia during the follow-up window. Conversion in CN participants was defined as having a diagnosis of CN at baseline but a diagnosis of MCI or dementia at the end of the follow-up. Conversion in participants with MCI was defined as having a diagnosis of MCI at baseline and a diagnosis of dementia by the end of the follow-up. Participants who had a baseline diagnosis of dementia or transitioned from MCI to CN were not included in this analysis. The analysis controlled for sex, age at baseline and length of the observation window. We investigated the influence of AD genetic risk on these results by conducting all analyses while additionally controlling for APOE ε4 carriership. We repeated these analyses for brain age gap.

We used repeated MRI measurements from ADNI (n = 1,302) and UKB (n = 4,601) to generate estimates of change in hippocampal GMV. We used longitudinal ComBat on ADNI MRI data to remove differential scanner effects115. Next, using all available time points for each participant, we generated multilevel linear models for bilateral hippocampal volume with random effects for both participant and age. Using these models, we derived trajectories to track change in hippocampal GMV for each participant. We then tested whether each participant's baseline DunedinPACNI scores could predict their subsequent rate of hippocampal atrophy. These analyses controlled for age, sex and length of the observation period. We investigated the influence of AD genetic risk on these results by conducting these analyses while additionally controlling for APOE ε4 carriership. We repeated these analyses for brain age gap.

To investigate the association between DunedinPACNI and morbidity, we used UKB data to calculate the standardized differences in DunedinPACNI scores between three groups based on the number of lifetime chronic disease diagnosis (0, 1, 2+). Next, we conducted a Cox proportional hazards regression using UKB participants' baseline DunedinPACNI scores to predict the onset of a chronic aging-related disease (n = 827 emergent diagnoses: myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia or stroke) in participants who had never previously received any of these diagnoses at the time of scanning (n = 40,753). Similarly, to investigate the association between DunedinPACNI and mortality, we conducted a Cox proportional hazards regression using UKB participants' baseline DunedinPACNI scores to predict death (n = 757 deaths). Both models controlled for baseline age, time to onset and sex. We repeated these analyses for brain age gap.

To investigate whether DunedinPACNI reflected gradients of socioeconomic inequality57, we first tested for linear relationships between DunedinPACNI and years of education in ADNI and UKB. We also tested for a linear relationship between DunedinPACNI and household income in UKB. These analyses controlled for sex and age. In ADNI, we included only the first MRI observation per participant.

To investigate whether DunedinPACNI generalizes to samples of individuals who are underrepresented in neuroimaging research59, we tested whether the degree of acceleration in DunedinPACNI among ADNI participants with dementia was similar in BrainLat participants with dementia. We tested for standardized differences by comparing the AD and FTD groups to the CN group, respectively. We also tested for linear associations between DunedinPACNI and MoCA scores. All analyses in this sample controlled for age and sex. We then compared the magnitude of acceleration among BrainLat participants with dementia to the previously identified acceleration among ADNI participants with dementia. Lastly, we compared the strength of the linear association between DunedinPACNI and MoCA scores in BrainLat participants to the previously identified association in ADNI participants.

We investigated how DunedinPACNI differs from two commonly used MRI-based measures of brain aging: hippocampal volume and ventricular volume. We calculated hippocampal volume as the sum of left and right hippocampal GMV measures derived from FreeSurfer. Likewise, we calculated ventricular volume as the sum of the left and right lateral ventricular volume measures. We first repeated cross-sectional associations with cognition, frailty and poor health in UKB, substituting DunedinPACNI with hippocampal volume or ventricular volume. Next, we conducted this same procedure with our Cox proportional hazards regression models of chronic disease and mortality risk in UKB, and cognitive decline risk among CN ADNI participants. Lastly, we compared coefficients for all analyses while including DunedinPACNI and either hippocampal volume or ventricular volume in the respective models. All analyses controlled for age and sex.

All visualizations were generated using the R package ggplot2 (ref. 116).

No significant differences in childhood IQ were found between the full cohort, those still alive, those seen at Phase 45, or those scanned at Phase 45. Those who were deceased by the Phase 45 data collection had significantly lower childhood IQ's than those who were still alive (t = 2.09, p = 0.04). Center lines of boxes represent the median. Lower and upper hinges of boxes represent the 25th and 75th percentiles. Whiskers show the range. The red line connects the means of each distribution. We report childhood IQ because it is known to be a strong predictor of late-life health outcomes, as shown by many cohort studies from many nations. Childhood IQ predicts health and social outcomes in adulthood, and these outcomes include physical functions, cognitive decline, mental health, inflammation, metabolic syndrome, disease incidence, dementia, mortality, and also neuroimaging-based, genomic, and epigenetic indicators of health. Based on the literature, we report three groups: study members who died before age 45, and thus could not have taken part in data collection, study members who were alive and thus could take part, and study members who actually did take part. We compared these three groups to the original birth cohort. The figure shows that the small group of study members who had died before age 45 had significantly lower mean childhood IQ as a group. Some of the early deaths were Dunedin Study members who had more disadvantages in their lives leading to poorer health and increased risk of early mortality. Study members who died of childhood diseases may have been already unwell at the time of IQ testing, which could have lowered their scores. However, cohort members who are still alive and cohort members who took part in data collection did not differ from the full original cohort on their mean childhood IQ; they still represent population variation on this key health risk factor. Abbreviations: IQ = intelligence quotient.

We report childhood SES because it is known to be a strong predictor of late-life health outcomes, as shown by many cohort studies from many nations. Childhood SES separately predicts health and social outcomes in adulthood, and these outcomes include physical functions, cognitive decline, mental health, inflammation, metabolic syndrome, disease incidence, dementia, mortality, and also neuroimaging-based, genomic, and epigenetic indicators of health.

Nature Climate Change

                         (2025)Cite this article


Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. Yet, little is known about the relationship between exposure to extreme events, subjective attribution of these events to climate change, and climate policy support, especially in the Global South. Combining large-scale natural and social science data from 68 countries (N = 71,922), we develop a measure of exposed population to extreme weather events and investigate whether exposure to extreme weather and subjective attribution of extreme weather to climate change predict climate policy support. We find that most people support climate policies and link extreme weather events to climate change. Subjective attribution of extreme weather was positively associated with policy support for five widely discussed climate policies. However, exposure to most types of extreme weather event did not predict policy support. Overall, these results suggest that subjective attribution could facilitate climate policy support.

Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (defined as an event that is rare at a particular place and time of year1), which puts a substantial proportion of the global population at physical and economic risk1. The cost of extreme weather events attributable to climate change is estimated at US$143 billion per year2. The impacts of extreme weather events are disproportionately felt in countries in the Global South3. Even though the Global South is at greater risk, attribution studies and social science research on human responses to such events overwhelmingly focus on countries and populations in the Global North4,5,6.

Mitigative action is needed to slow climate change and mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events. So far, global efforts have been insufficient, which calls for more stringent climate policies. Public support for climate policies is important because such support can drive governmental policy outputs7 and policymakers often respond to public demand for climate policies8.

The psychological distance of climate change (that is, the perception that climate change is spatially, temporally and socially distant) may help explain societal inaction on this issue9. If so, public awareness and understanding of climate change may increase as more people experience extreme weather events for themselves10,11,12,13,14,15. However, previous studies on the relationship between experiencing extreme weather events and climate change action and beliefs have produced inconsistent findings. In particular, some studies have found that experiencing extreme weather events increases climate change belief16, concern11,17,18,19, support for climate policies and green parties17,20,21,22,23, and climate change adaptation24, while other studies found no relationship6,25,26,27. Studies using aggregate objective measures of exposure to and impacts of extreme weather events often find no effect of extreme weather experience on climate change attitudes25,26,28. For example, one US study found that living in an area with higher fatalities from extreme weather events was associated with perceiving more climate risks29, while another US study found that fatalities from extreme weather events were not associated with opinions about climate change30. However, these studies used different definitions and measurements of extreme weather events, and these extreme weather events were compared with different psychological and behavioural outcomes27. Further, most studies have focused on a single country31 or a single type of extreme weather event (for example, heatwaves), which limits the comparability of the impacts of different types of extreme weather event. This limitation is considerable, as a meta-analysis found notable differences in effect sizes depending on the type of extreme weather event32.

The inconsistency of previous studies might also be explained by another important factor: whether people attribute the extreme weather event to climate change6,11,31,33,34,35. Recent studies support this hypothesis: people who attribute extreme weather events to climate change are more likely to perceive climate change as a risk and to report engaging in mitigation behaviour36,37. For example, a study in the United Kingdom found that the subjective attribution of floods to climate change is a necessary condition for the experience of floods to translate into climate change threat perception36. However, no cross-country evidence exists on the subjective attribution of extreme weather events to climate change.

We combined natural and social science approaches to examine how extreme weather events and their attribution to climate change relate to support for widely discussed climate change mitigation policies across 68 countries (N = 71,922). This study employed an interdisciplinary design by triangulating data on exposed populations computed using the probabilistic CLIMADA risk modelling platform38,39 with global survey data on subjective attribution of extreme weather events and support for climate policies collected in the Trust in Science and Science-related Populism (TISP) study40. We used a standardized metric to comparatively assess the relationship between the size of exposed populations to several extreme weather events—river floods, heatwaves, European winter storms, tropical cyclones, wildfires, heavy precipitation and droughts—and climate policy support. Specifically, we modelled how many people in a country were exposed to extreme weather events over the past few decades relative to the total population. We referred to this as the ‘exposed population' (see Online Methods).

Our preregistered study addressed the following research questions: (1) Does exposure to extreme weather events on the population level relate to climate policy support? (2) Do subjective attribution and exposed population have an interactive effect on policy support? In addition, we addressed the following non-preregistered questions: (1) What is the level of public support for five climate policies across countries? (2) To what degree do people attribute extreme weather events to climate change across countries (subjective attribution) and is subjective attribution related to policy support?

We hypothesized that people who live in countries with higher exposure would show stronger support for mitigative climate policies, and that the relationship between exposed population and policy support would be stronger for individuals with higher subjective attribution. We also hypothesized that the relationship between exposed population and policy support is associated with people's income and residence area (urban vs rural), which might relate to their adaptation potential to extreme events. Note that not all preregistered questions are addressed in this paper.

We assessed support for the following five climate policies with a 3-point scale (1 = not at all, 2 = moderately, 3 = very much): Increasing taxes on carbon-intense foods, raising taxes on fossil fuels, expanding infrastructure for public transportation, increasing the use of sustainable energy, and protecting forested and land areas. In line with previous research, increasing carbon taxes received the lowest support41,42, with only 22% and 29% of people, respectively, indicating they very much support increased taxes on carbon-intensive foods and fossil fuels (Fig. 1a). Protecting forested and land areas, by contrast, was a popular policy option, with 82% supporting it very much and only 3% not supporting it at all. The second most-supported policy was increasing the use of sustainable energy, with 75% supporting it very much, and only 5% not supporting it at all. For further analyses, we combined responses to the five policy options into an index (α = 0.61; see factor analysis in Supplementary Table 12 and non-preregistered analyses with policy subscales in Supplementary Fig. 7).

a, Weighted response probabilities for single items measuring support for climate policies. b, Mean support for climate policies in 66 countries (climate policy support was not measured in Argentina and Malaysia). Participants were asked: “Please indicate your level of support for the following policies.” Response option ‘not applicable' is not shown. No data were available for countries shaded in light grey.

A clear majority supported climate policies in all countries (global mean (M) = 2.37, s.d. = 0.43 on a scale from 1 = Not at all, 2 = Moderately and 3 = Very much). These findings are in line with a previous study showing that 89% of participants demand intensified political action on climate change43. We calculated mean support by averaging participants' support for five policies (see Online Methods and Fig. 1). This mean value is representative in terms of gender, age and education due to post-stratification weighting (see Online Methods). We found strong differences in support across countries and policies (Fig. 1b). Support for climate policies was particularly high in African and Asian countries, average in Australia, Costa Rica and the United Kingdom, and below the global average in several European countries, such as Czechia, Finland and Norway (Supplementary Figs. 1–6). Non-preregistered analyses comparing our aggregate measure with policy support subscales (that is, support for taxes, support for green transition) can be found in Supplementary Fig. 7. Our results for the aggregate measure and policy subscales were mostly consistent.

Participants who identified as men, were younger, more religious, had higher education, higher income, left-leaning politics and who lived in urban areas were more likely to support climate policies (Supplementary Tables 1–7 and Fig. 8), in line with previous studies44,45.

Participants indicated subjective attribution by rating the degree to which they believed that climate change has increased the impact of six extreme weather events—droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, heavy rain, floods, heavy storms—in their country over the past decades (1 = Not at all, 5 = Very much). Responses to the six items were mean averaged (α = 0.92). Globally, subjective attribution of extreme weather events to climate change was well above the scale midpoint in all countries (M = 3.80, s.d. = 1.02). In line with a previous study36, non-preregistered analyses showed that subjective attribution was positively related to identifying as a woman, being older, more religious, having higher education and higher income, living in an urban (vs rural) area and self-identifying as politically liberal and left-leaning (Supplementary Table 8).

There was little variation in subjective attribution across extreme event types. Subjective attribution appeared relatively lower for wildfires (M = 3.67, s.d. = 1.28) and higher for heatwaves (M = 3.94, s.d. = 1.16). However, subjective attribution varied across global regions (Fig. 2). Participants in South American countries most strongly agreed that the occurrence of extreme weather events has been affected by climate change over the past decades, especially in Brazil and Colombia (Supplementary Fig. 9). Subjective attribution was lowest in Northern European and African countries (Supplementary Fig. 9). Lower subjective attribution in African countries could be explained by the fact that climate change awareness and belief in human-caused climate change are still relatively low across African countries46.

Data from 67 countries. Subjective attribution was not assessed in Albania. No data were available for countries shaded in light grey.

The size of the exposed population varied by the type of extreme event (Fig. 3). While almost all the sampled populations were exposed to heatwaves and heavy precipitation over the past decades at least once, fewer populations had been exposed to droughts, wildfires and floods. Our fully anonymous data did not allow geospatially matching participants to certain areas where extreme events occurred; we therefore do not know whether participants were personally exposed to those events and cannot test whether exposure at the individual level relates to policy support. However, we can reliably estimate whether exposure at the population level relates to policy support.

Exposed population refers to the average annual proportion of a country's total population exposed to a specific weather-related hazard and averaged over the past few decades. The exact time frame varies slightly across events. Exposed population is modelled for the 68 countries included in the survey. a, Exposed population to droughts. b, Exposed population to European winter storms. c, Exposed population to heatwaves. d, Exposed population to heavy precipitation. e, Exposed population to river floods. f, Exposed population to tropical cyclones. g, Exposed population to wildfires. No data were available for countries shaded in light grey.

We investigated whether exposure at the country level and subjective attribution of extreme events at the individual level were associated with stronger climate policy support. Since we were interested in studying how the relationships vary between different types of extreme weather event and policy support, we ran seven blockwise multilevel regression models—one for each type of extreme weather event—predicting an index of climate policy support. Because participants were clustered within countries, our models included random intercepts across countries. Step 1 of the blockwise regression included socio-demographic variables and exposed population. In Step 2, we added subjective attribution for the specific event and three interaction terms: exposed population × subjective attribution, exposed population × income and exposed population × residence area.

Belief that climate change has impacted local extreme weather events predicted support for climate policy (Fig. 4). Random effects models show that the relationship between subjective attribution and policy support was significantly stronger in North America, Australia and in several European countries than the mean global effect, and significantly weaker in Peru and South Africa (Supplementary Figs. 10–16).

Summary of seven multilevel models, one for each type of extreme weather event, with random intercepts across countries predicting climate policy support and controlling for socio-demographic variables and two additional interaction terms. Models include data from 65 countries. Error bars denote 95% confidence intervals. Circles denote standardized estimates. Filled circles denote significant effects at P < 0.05. Exact P values for non-significant effects of exposed population: droughts: P = 0.275; European winter storms: P = 0.466; heatwaves: P = 0.369; river floods: P = 0.278; tropical cyclones: P = 0.409. Full models for each event type can be found in Supplementary Tables 1–7.

For five out of the seven extreme weather events, exposed population size did not predict policy support (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Tables 1–7). However, people in countries more exposed to wildfires were more supportive of climate policies (Supplementary Table 5). Conversely, people in countries more exposed to heavy precipitation were less supportive of climate policies (Supplementary Table 3). We conducted additional exploratory, non-preregistered robustness checks to investigate whether exposed population and land area, as well as exposed population and climate change belief at the country level had an interactive effect on policy support. Since climate change belief was not assessed in this study, we relied on country-level data from another study47, available for 48 countries included in this study. The relationship between exposure to heavy precipitation/wildfires and policy support was no longer statistically significant when controlling for beliefs and land area, while the relationship between subjective attribution and policy support remained significant (Supplementary Fig. 17). Therefore, the relationship between exposure to wildfires/heavy precipitation and policy support should be interpreted with caution.

We tested whether exposed population size and subjective attribution interacted to predict policy support, as investigated in previous studies33,36,37. We found that the relationship between exposed population and policy support was stronger for participants with higher attribution of heatwaves and tropical cyclones, whereas the relationship between exposed population and policy support was weaker for participants with higher attribution of heavy precipitation and European winter storms. However, we found the opposite interaction effect for river floods, droughts and wildfires: as subjective attribution increases, the relationship between exposed population and policy support weakens. In other words, for individuals with high subjective attribution, support for policies is already high and less dependent on exposure to these extreme events. In contrast, for individuals with low subjective attribution, support for policies increases with higher exposure to droughts, floods and wildfires (Fig. 5).

The lines represent varying levels of subjective attribution at −1s.d, the mean and +1 s.d., with shaded regions indicating 95% confidence intervals. The x axis shows the standardized exposed population size.

These findings are in tension with the results of previous studies, which reported a positive moderation effect for flooding36, a negative moderation effect for hurricanes33 and no moderation effect for wildfires37.

Our seven multilevel models each included interaction effects for exposed population × income and exposed population × residence area. We found significant interactions with small effect sizes for river floods and wildfires, but not for any other events. For river floods, we found a negative interaction effect with income and a positive interaction with urban areas (Supplementary Table 4). This indicates that the relationship between exposed population size and policy support was stronger for individuals with lower income as well as for individuals who live in urban areas. For wildfires, we found a positive statistical effect for income, meaning that the relationship between exposed population and policy support was stronger for richer individuals (Supplementary Fig. 18).

This study provides global evidence that subjective attribution of extreme weather events to climate change is associated with greater policy support for climate mitigation. Overall, different extreme weather events appear to have different relationships with climate policy support. This pattern highlights the importance of comparative analyses that consider different types of event.

We additionally provide evidence that subjective attribution is high, and particularly so in Latin America. This might be explained by the fact that belief in human-caused climate change and self-reported personal experience of extreme weather events are high in Latin America48, and that people in Latin American countries were among the most likely to report that climate change will harm them and future generations a great deal and that climate change should be a high priority for their government49. The finding that the relationship between subjective attribution and policy support was weaker in some Latin American countries might therefore be due to a ceiling effect

In line with previous studies36, we also found that subjective attribution interacts with exposure to European winter storms, heatwaves, heavy precipitation and tropical cyclones to predict climate policy support. Mere exposure to extreme weather events might therefore not suffice to increase policy support unless individuals link these events to climate change30. While larger exposure to extreme events was not found to be related to policy support (except for wildfires), we cannot rule out that changes in the frequency of extreme weather events over time might be sufficient to shift support. Nevertheless, our data suggest that if individuals attribute extreme weather events to climate change, support for climate policies is higher regardless of whether the events are more frequent. The reverse causal relationship is also possible: people who are supportive of climate policies are more likely to attribute extreme weather to climate change. Longitudinal panel studies are needed to investigate the nature and direction of this relationship.

These findings might also help explain previous inconsistent results on the relationship between extreme weather event experience and mitigation behaviour. Few of these studies assessed whether participants linked these events to climate change, therefore missing a key controlling variable. Consequently, we strongly recommend that future studies assess subjective attribution. We found a negative relationship between exposed population to heavy precipitation and policy support in our preregistered model. Subjective attribution was relatively low for heavy precipitation. This corroborates previous findings that people often fail to link extreme rainfall with climate change10. In line with this argument, a media analysis that investigated themes in climate change coverage in 10 countries (2006–2018) found that media reporting on extreme weather events mostly focused on weather anomalies, as well as fires, hurricanes and storms50. Countries more exposed to heavy precipitation might therefore be less willing to support climate policies because they are less likely to link those events to climate change. Our moderation analyses show that the negative effect of heavy precipitation exposure on policy support is strongest for people with low subjective attribution. This further highlights the need for more research on climate change communication on types of extreme weather event that are not typically associated with climate change, such as heavy precipitation, as these events might serve as ‘teachable moments'15. However, it should be noted that the relationship between exposure to heavy precipitation and policy support was no longer significant in our exploratory analyses that included the interactions of exposed population with land area and climate change belief. This finding should therefore be interpreted with caution.

Wildfires are the only type of extreme weather event that positively predicts climate policy support when controlling for subjective attribution, although this effect was no longer significant in models that included interaction effects for exposure with land area and climate change belief. Several previous studies similarly reported a positive relationship between wildfire exposure and climate policy support23,37,51,52. This positive relationship could be explained by the fact that wildfires often result in extensive and visible damage51, and are linked to personal health concerns due to smoke exposure53. Another study found that among Australian adults who directly experienced wildfires, 45% increased individual climate activism, providing further evidence of the effects of wildfires on behavioural intentions54.

Contrary to our hypothesis, the relationship between exposed population and policy support was weaker for individuals with higher subjective attribution of droughts, floods and wildfires. One possible explanation is that these three types of extreme weather event allow for management strategies that can directly reduce the hazard itself, such as man-made flood protections, irrigation systems, prescribed burn-offs and land-use policies. Therefore, people may be more likely to support policies pertaining to law enforcement or economic regulations instead of climate change mitigation55,56. In contrast, although heavy precipitation, storms and heatwaves are exacerbated by climate change and can be mitigated by addressing it, once they occur, we can only manage their impacts, not prevent their occurrence. Future research should investigate these interactions and explore the possibility that the size of the exposed population moderates the relationship between subjective attribution and policy support, rather than subjective attribution moderating the effect between the size of the exposed population and policy support.

Our measure of exposed population has strengths and limitations. While the standardized metric of exposed population allows the comparison of the impacts of different events across countries, it is a relative measure (that is, to a country's total population) and does not reflect the severity of exposure or the potential for individuals to be repeatedly exposed to different events. Further, the measure does not consider the exposure to compound events57, that is, when two or more events occur in an interacting combination. No conclusions can be drawn as to whether the participants in the study were directly exposed to these events. This measure therefore reflects the broader population-level exposure to these events, rather than individual-level exposure. The data cannot speak to whether exposure at the individual level relates to policy support. However, it can be reliably concluded that exposure at the population level did not relate to policy support. Some extreme weather events are less likely to be experienced directly (for example, floods or hurricanes), but they still receive widespread media coverage. The approach of analysing exposure at the population level therefore allows the study of effects that go beyond individual exposure to events. It should be noted that for some extreme weather events (for example, heatwaves and heavy precipitation), variance was very low, given that most people were affected by these events at some points over the past few decades (Supplementary Table 9).

Since the measure of exposed population included the past few decades, the estimates here are probably conservative for the effects of exposure. Researchers have found that temporal proximity of an event matters for climate change concern: the more recent an event, the larger the impact on climate change concern18. Since some of these events occur infrequently (for example, tropical cyclones), longer time frames such as in this study have the advantage that they allow the comparison of the effects of several different events in a global context58.

With the use of a measure of exposure to extreme weather events at the population level, this article finds that subjective attribution predicts climate policy support, while exposure to five out of the seven extreme events considered in this study does not predict policy support. Overall, ensuring subjective attribution might be an important way to increase support for climate policies37. Experimental research could focus on finding effective communication strategies to increase subjective attribution among the public to help develop causal models (for example, ref. 59). Extreme weather events are increasingly linked to climate change in news and social media50,60,61,62,63, but more research is needed to study communication of extreme weather events and their attribution in the Global South62,64.

This study relies on the dataset collected for the TISP Many Labs study40. Detailed information on the data collection strategy can be found in ref. 65. Participants were asked to carefully read a consent form (approved under IRB protocol number IRB22-1046), which included some general information about the study and the anonymity of the data. Only participants who consented to participating in the study were allowed to proceed with the study.

Data were collected in surveys that used quotas for age (five bins: 20% 18–29 years, 20% 30–39 years, 20% 40–49 years, 20% 50–59 years, 20% 60 years and older) and gender (two bins: 50% men, 50% women). To generate models with parameters that are representative for target populations in terms of gender, age and education, and have more precise standard errors, we used post-stratification weights. Specifically, we computed post-stratification weights at country level, sample size weights for each country, post-stratification weights for the complete sample, and rescaled post-stratification weights for multilevel analyses.

Participants were asked: “Many countries have introduced policies to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change. This can include the implementation of laws aiming to reduce greenhouse gases, for example. Please indicate your level of support for the following policies: 1) Raising carbon taxes on gas and fossil fuels or coal, 2) Expanding infrastructure for public transportation, 3) Increasing the use of sustainable energy such as wind and solar energy, 4) Protecting forested and land areas, 5) Increasing taxes on carbon intense foods (for example, beef and dairy products).” Response options ranged from 1 = Not at all, 2 = Moderately, 3 = Very much, and 4 = Not applicable. Response option 4 was coded as missing for the analyses.

Participants were asked: “The next questions are about climate change and weather events. When you answer them, please think about your country. To what extent do you think that climate change has increased the impact of the following weather events over the last decades? 1) Floods, 2) Heatwaves, 3) Heavy storms, 4) Wildfires, 5) Heavy rain, 6) Droughts.” Response options ranged from 1 = Not at all, to 5 = Very much.

See ref. 65 for a detailed overview of the other measures.

We submitted a detailed preregistration including research questions, hypotheses and an analysis plan to OSF (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/G23A7) before data collection on 15 November 2022.

To estimate the relationships between subjective attribution, exposed population and three interaction terms (exposed population × subjective attribution; exposed population × income log (US$); exposed population × residence area (urban vs rural)), we used blockwise multilevel regression models with random intercepts across countries. In addition, we computed models with random effects to estimate how the effects of subjective attribution on climate policy support varied across countries. We scaled all independent variables by country means and country s.d.s, except for the country-level variable ‘exposed population', which we scaled with grand means and grand s.d.s.

We estimated the reliability of our two scales: subjective attribution and climate policy support. Scale reliability of subjective attribution in the global sample was very high, with Cronbach's alpha = 0.92 and omega = 0.92. An overview of the reliability of subjective attribution across 67 countries (ranging from omega = 0.74 to omega = 0.95) can be found in Supplementary Table 10. Scale reliability of climate policy support in the global sample was acceptable, with Cronbach's alpha = 0.61 and omega = 0.62. An overview of the reliability of climate policy support across 66 countries (ranging from omega = 0.40 to omega = 0.75) can be found in Supplementary Table 11. To further assess the robustness of our policy support scale, we ran a polychoric parallel analysis with principal axis factoring to inspect how many factors should be retained for an exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The parallel analysis determined that two factors should be kept for an EFA. We therefore ran an EFA with unweighted least squares factoring and promax oblique rotation to inspect two factor loadings (Supplementary Table 12). Our items clearly loaded on two factors, with items relating to the expansion of public transport, protected areas and increasing renewable energy loading on Factor 1 (labelled as ‘Green transition') and the two items related to increasing taxes on meat and dairy and fossil fuels loading on Factor 2 (labelled as ‘Taxes'). The Taxes subscale had good internal reliability (omega = 0.73). The Green transition subscale had moderate, but still acceptable reliability (omega = 0.61), comparable with the reliability of the aggregate scale (omega = 0.62).

We further conducted three non-preregistered robustness checks. Specifically, we examined whether our results are robust to the inclusion of an interaction between land area of countries (in square kilometres) and exposed population, an interaction between country-level climate change belief and exposed population, and across the two climate policy support subscales (Taxes and Green Transition). Data on climate change belief were retrieved from the Climate Many Labs study as processed by Our World in Data66, while data on land area were retrieved from multiple sources compiled by World Bank (2024) and processed by Our World in Data67. Data on land area for Taiwan was retrieved from ref. 68. The term ‘country' in this Article refers to both sovereign states and territories not recognized as such.

In this study, we used the open-source, probabilistic CLIMADA (CLIMate ADAptation) risk modelling platform38,39 for the spatially explicit computation of exposed population from different hazards on a grid at 150 arc-seconds (~4.5 km at the equator) resolution. CLIMADA was designed to simulate the interaction of climate and weather-related hazards, the exposure of assets or populations to this hazard, and the specific vulnerability of exposed infrastructure and people in a globally consistent fashion. The platform has been developed and maintained as a community project, and the Python 3 source code is openly available under the terms of the GNU General Public License (v.3)39.

We used the Gridded Population of the World (GPW) dataset v.4.11, published in 2020 (CIESIN, 2018)69, to map population exposure across the 68 countries. The GPW dataset was chosen for its high spatial resolution and its comprehensive and consistent coverage, providing population count estimates at a granularity of 30 arc-seconds (~1 km at the equator), which we aggregated to match the 150-arc-second resolution used in our risk model.

Seven types of extreme weather event were analysed in this study: droughts, river floods, heatwaves, heavy precipitation, tropical cyclones, wildfires and European winter storms, which form the input hazard layer in our risk model. We computed the exposed population to these events. Detailed information on the definition of each event, data sources, the years covered and other relevant details for each type of extreme weather event are provided in Supplementary Table 13.

Each hazard in this study was defined on the basis of its unique characteristics and the potential impact it has on the exposed population, with the chosen underlying datasets ensuring consistent coverage across all countries involved. Some of these hazards were evaluated in an event-based perspective (for example, tropical cyclones, wildfires), while others were assessed as annually aggregated measures (for example, river floods, heatwaves). Hazards were inferred either from historical records (tropical cyclones, European winter storms, wildfires), climate reanalyses of a reference period (heatwaves, heavy precipitation) or historical climate modelling (droughts, river floods). In instances where multiple (climate) models contribute to the hazard modelling, we computed the multimodel median impact on the exposed population.

For drought, we utilized a ‘long-term' definition based on soil moisture70, a methodology that primarily captures agricultural impacts, potentially leading to indirect effects on populations. Furthermore, the dataset provides annual maxima, without representing single drought events, which potentially limits the depth of our risk analysis for certain areas.

In the case of river floods, the datasets used in this study represent large rivers and fluvial floods, while coastal or pluvial floods are not included70,71. We note that ‘heavy precipitation' as a different hazard may serve as a proxy for pluvial or flash floods. Besides, there was a potential overestimation of affected areas due to the methodology of considering full grid cells as affected.

For heatwaves and extreme precipitation events, we characterized the hazards on the basis of deviations from the 20-year reference period 1980–1999. We utilized ERA-5 reanalysis data to display observed trends as changes between the reference period and the more recent 20-year period 2000–201972. Finally, changes were displayed as the multimodel median.

Wildfires of the historical period 2000–2019 were assessed using satellite imagery to derive thermal anomalies. A grid cell was considered affected if the temperature exceeded 300 K73. The historical period is determined by the data availability through the MODIS satellite mission. The approach does not distinguish between intentional and unintentional fires, and the dataset captures gridpoint-specific annual maxima only.

Finally, in our preregistration, we broadly categorized tropical cyclones and European winter storms under the umbrella term ‘storms'. Typically, tropical cyclones prevail in tropical and subtropical regions, while our modelled winter storms are predominantly observed in Europe. Given their distinct geographical occurrences, the impacts of these two storm types can be considered additive or complementary. However, tropical cyclone impacts in higher latitudes, where storms often undergo extratropical transition (for example, Sandy in 2012, Dorian in 2019, Fiona in 2020), were included in the tropical cyclone category due to their origin. While this classification ensured consistency with our framework, modelling these exposures carries higher uncertainty compared with the tropics and subtropics. In addition, storm impacts are expressed relative to population size, which may lead to disproportionately high exposure percentages in regions with low population density compared with densely populated areas experiencing similar storm frequencies. We relied on historical records to assess the impacts of both storm hazards74,75, and readers should interpret the results for higher latitudes with these considerations in mind.

In this study, we defined ‘exposed population' as the average annual proportion of a country's total population exposed to a specific weather-related hazard within a given time period. An overview of time periods can be found in Supplementary Table 13. This was calculated by summing the number of individuals in each 150-arc-second grid cell who have experienced the hazard at least once during the study period and then dividing this sum by the country's total population, based on the GPW dataset. Therefore, this metric is relative and does not reflect the severity of exposure or the potential for individuals to be repeatedly impacted by different events. In addition, in large countries such as the United States, different hazards may affect different regional populations (for example, wildfires on the West Coast versus tropical cyclones in the East) which, unfortunately, is not captured in our country-level aggregation. The exposed population is presented as a percentage of the total population, providing a standardized measure for comparative analysis across the 68 countries included in our study.

The bacterial flagellar motor, which spins a helical propeller for propulsion, has undergone evolutionary diversification across bacterial species, often involving the addition of structures associated with increasing torque for motility in viscous environments. Understanding how such structures function and have evolved is hampered by challenges in visualizing motors in situ. Here we developed a Campylobacter jejuni minicell system for in situ cryogenic electron microscopy imaging and single-particle analysis of its motor, one of the most complex flagellar motors known, to subnanometre resolution. Focusing on the large periplasmic structures which are essential for increasing torque, our structural data, interpreted with molecular models, show that the basal disk comprises concentric rings of FlgP. The medial disk is a lattice of PflC with PflD, while the proximal disk is a rim of PflB attached to spokes of PflA. PflAB dimerization is essential for proximal disk assembly, recruiting FliL to scaffold more stator complexes at a wider radius which increases torque. We also acquired insights into universal principles of flagellar torque generation. This in situ approach is broadly applicable to other membrane-residing bacterial molecular machines.

How evolution innovates remains a fundamental question. While innovations in eukaryotes often arise by rewiring existing gene transcriptional netwoks1, examples of the emergence of evolutionary novelty at the molecular-scale focus on small protein complexes2,3,4,5. What is needed is a comprehensive case study of a family of molecular machines that have diversified, so we can infer how their diversity evolved.

Bacterial flagella, helical propellers rotated by cell-envelope-embedded rotary motors, are icons of the evolution of molecular novelty6 (Fig. 1a). The flagellum, best studied in model organisms Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Escherichia coli, is composed of a ring of inner-membrane motor proteins (‘stator complexes') that harness ion flux to rotate a large cytoplasmic rotor ring (the ‘C-ring'). Torque is transmitted through a chassis (the ‘MS-ring') and periplasm-spanning axial driveshaft (the ‘rod') to an extracellular propeller structure that generates thrust. Structures of the C-ring7,8,9, parts of stator complexes10,11, MS-ring and rod12,13, and axial structures14,15 have recently been determined from purified subcomplexes.

a, Schematic of the flagellar motor6. Proton flux through the stator complexes drives rotation of the C-ring, MS-ring, rod and hook/filament. In C. jejuni and other Campylobacterota, a basal disk and periplasmic scaffold have evolved that scaffold a wider ring of additional stator complexes thought to increase motor torque17. IM/OM, inner/outer membrane. b, Wildtype C. jejuni cells used in previous studies17 typically provide 1 flagellar motor per field of view (arrowhead) as compared with c, many motors per field of view in our minicell strain (arrowheads), greatly increasing throughput and reducing sample thickness for higher-quality electron micrograph acquisition. Note that curvature of minicells is comparable to wildtype cells. The 51781 raw micrographs are available from EMPIAR90 (https://doi.org/10.6019/EMPIAR-11580). d, Periplasmic and cytoplasmic features are evident in single-particle analysis 2D classes of manually picked motors. e, Cross-section through an isosurface rendering of a C17 whole-motor 3D reconstruction (deposited as EMD-16723). f, Map from e segmented and exploded along the z axis to highlight component substructures.

Source data

Because flagella may pre-date the emergence of the bacteria, their age renders understanding how these core structures first evolved challenging. More tractable is the promise of understanding how recent diversifications evolved. Many flagellar motors have recruited additional proteins that scaffold more stator complexes than the ~11 seen in model motors16,17,18. By increasing the number of stator complexes and increasing the radius at which they exert leverage to rotate the C-ring, these adaptations increase the magnitude of the motor's maximum torque output17: while Salmonella and E. coli motors deliver torque up to ~1,300 pN nm, spirochaete motors (with 16 stator complexes and substantially wider C-ring) deliver up to 4,000 pN nm19, and Campylobacterota motors (with 17 or 18 stator complexes and wide C-ring) up to 3,600 pN nm20. Such adaptations probably facilitated species with high-torque motors to inhabit viscous environments such as mucous21. Understanding the architecture of these relatively recently evolved adaptations is a prerequisite to understanding how they evolved.

The Campylobacterota, a phylum that includes gastrointestinal pathogens Campylobacter jejuni and Helicobacter pylori17,21, feature some of the most complex motors known, incorporating additional proteins that scaffold their wider ring of stator complexes to generate greater torque than E. coli and Salmonella18. Comparisons of diverse Campylobacterota motors and contextualization against the C. jejuni motor, the best-studied Campylobacterota motor, have suggested a stepwise evolutionary recruitment of these scaffolding proteins18. First, inner-membrane-associated periplasmic proteins (PflA and PflB, from ‘paralyzed flagellum' proteins A and B) were recruited to template assembly of a wider ring of the stator complex motor proteins17. This wider ring could exert greater leverage on a correspondingly wider C-ring to increase the motor's torque, an adaptation that may have enabled lifestyles in the highly viscous gut mucous that many contemporary Campylobacterota species inhabit17,21. Independently, a large (~100-nm-wide) outer membrane-associated ‘basal disk' of FlgP evolved17,18,22, which we recently found is needed for buttressing the motor while the flagellar filament wraps and unwraps from the cell23. We have speculated that these structures were initially independent but subsequently became co-dependent for assembly18. The physical basis for this and the origins of these new proteins remain unclear.

Understanding how and why these additional proteins were incorporated into the motor and how they contribute to function requires molecular-scale models, but their size, intimate membrane association and multiple moving parts have hampered structural determination. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) subtomogram average structures at 16–18 Å resolution12,24 and structures of purified flagellar motors by single-particle analysis cryoEM lacking dynamic components7,8,9,12,13 do not study the molecular architecture of the additional structures. Meanwhile advances in imaging membrane proteins in situ are most often in spherical liposomes rather than in their native context25,26.

To address these challenges, we engineered C. jejuni minicells for subnanometre-resolution structure determination of the flagellar motor in situ. The quality of our map enabled us to assemble a molecular model of its evolutionary elaborations. Our model provides insights into the contributions of new proteins, reveals distant homologies, identifies previously unknown components, contextualizes adaptations of pre-existing core machinery and acquires observations informative of how flagellar motors generate rotation.

To increase particle number for high-resolution structure determination, we exploited the multiply flagellated, still-motile minicell phenotype produced by a ΔflhG mutation27, but removed the flagellar filament by deleting filament-encoding genes flaA and flaB for centrifugal purification (Fig. 1b,c). The resulting ~200-nm-diameter minicells are more homogeneous than ~350-nm-diameter minicells from Enterobacteriaceae such as E. coli, Shigella and Salmonella28. The polar curvature remains comparable to wildtype cells, meaning motor structures are unperturbed (Fig. 1b,c).

We acquired micrographs of minicells for in situ single-particle analysis. Initial two-dimensional (2D) classification revealed features including the stator complexes and their periplasmic scaffold, basal disk, C-ring, MS-ring and rod (Fig. 1d). Classification and refinement applying the dominant C17 symmetry17 yielded a reconstruction to 9.4 Å resolution by gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) using 32,790 particles (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1). The majority of the periplasmic structures exhibited 17-fold symmetric features consistent with discrete proteins (Fig. 1e,f). The basal disk is composed of concentric rings, but while the first ring featured 17-fold symmetry, subsequent rings were cylindrical averages, indicating that they do not share the 17-fold symmetry of the other periplasmic structures. The symmetry-mismatched core structures were also cylindrical averages. Given that these symmetry-mismatched regions comprise universally conserved structures (such as the P-, L-, MS- and C-rings) and the stator complexes which have already been structurally characterized7,8,9,10,11,12,13, we focused on C. jejuni's relatively recently evolved 17-fold symmetric periplasmic scaffold structures. Focused refinement resolved this region to 7.9 Å (Fig. 2a,b, and Extended Data Figs. 1d–f and 2a–c), sufficient to resolve α-helices and β-sheets.

a, Left: focused C17 refinement of the periplasmic scaffold and inner ring of the multi-ring basal disk (deposited as EMD-16724) shows that the scaffold attaches to the innermost 5 concentric rings of the basal disk. Right: 1 asymmetric unit of the periplasmic scaffold. Asterisks denote densities beneath the first 5 rings. Only the innermost ring (dashed box) is 17-fold symmetric; subsequent rings were not part of the focused refinement. b, AlphaFold2 (ref. 29) structures of FlgP oligomers reveal that the innermost basal disk ring is composed of 51 FlgP monomers as 17 trimers. c, Fit of a FlgP trimer and interaction with the 17-fold symmetric density of the medial disk (asterisks). d, Top view of a fit of 7 FlgP monomers. e, Density of 10 concentric basal disk rings (left) and fitted FlgP models (right). f, The SHS2-like fold of FlgP (dashed box) is shared with dodecin30 (PDBID: 1MOG), Helicobacter pylori Lpp20 (ref. 31) (PDBID: 5OK8) and Vibrio alginolyticus FlgT49 (PDBID: 3W1E). FlgP uniquely features the ring-forming β-hairpin insert. g, AlphaFold2 (ref. 29) model of FlgQ structurally resembles a 2-FlgP repeat. h, 100 × 100 nm slice through the subtomogram average structure of a motor in which FlgQ was fused to mCherry is indistinguishable from the WT motor (deposited as EMD-17419). i, The C. jejuni LP-rings have comparable diameters to the 26-fold symmetric Salmonella LP-rings. The density map of the Salmonella LP-rings12 (EMD-12183) was low-pass filtered to 15 Å resolution and cylindrically averaged for comparison with the C. jejuni LP-rings (Additional data for EMD-16723). The C. jejuni L- and P-rings are of comparable diameters to those from Salmonella. Green arrowhead indicates Salmonella YecR, blue arrowhead an unidentified C. jejuni density. j, Support for the C. jejuni LP-rings having comparable stoichiometry to E. coli and Salmonella from ~26 steps in flagellar rotation. Top: kernel density estimation of bead position as a function of rotation. Bottom: weighted power spectrum of angular position; grey dashed line highlights 26. Inset: x,y-position histogram with density represented by darkness of coloration (Extended Data Fig. 5 shows 10 other traces).

The basal disk forms a concave cup that pushes the outer membrane away at greater disk radii (Fig. 2a). We focused on the first, 17-fold symmetric ring. These 17 repeats were composed of 3-repeat units, making a ring of 51 similar subunits in 17 trimeric repeats. Knowing that the disk is composed of FlgP17,22, we predicted monomeric and multimeric structures of FlgP, excluding the N-terminal signal sequence and linker22 to the membrane23, using AlphaFold2 (ref. 29). Oligomers laterally associated to form a continuous β-sheet, with interaction of 1 FlgP with the next 2 protomers. Bending the arc of these oligomers demonstrated that 17 trimeric repeats, that is, 51 protomers, fit into the 51 periodic densities of the innermost ring of the basal disk, with a map-model FSC of 9.9 Å at FSC = 0.5 (Fig. 2a–d, and Extended Data Figs. 2d, 3a and 4a). Each trimeric repeat also featured an additional medial disk-facing density (Fig. 2a–c). Although we could not discern the symmetries of rings beyond the first, assembly of the disk is entirely reliant upon flgP17. Subsequent rings all have comparable cross-section densities, making them unlikely to be composed of another protein. On the basis of ratios of circumferences, we predict that each subsequent ring adds 11 protomers, explaining the symmetry mismatch with the 17-fold symmetric structures (Fig. 2e). Attempts at focused refinement of discrete rings failed, possibly due to insufficient signal from the 11.5 kDa FlgP subunits that lack prominent features to assist alignment.

FlgP features a modified SHS2 domain fold from InterPro family IPR024952, with a three-stranded β-sheet and an α-helix spanning one face30 (Fig. 2f). Structural similarity searches revealed that this fold is also present in dodecin30, Helicobacter Lpp20 (ref. 31), and γ-proteobacterial FlgT, a flagellar component from sodium-driven flagellar motors (Fig. 2f). FlgP, however, features an additional C-terminal helix and long β-hairpin insert between the SHS2 α-helix and the second SHS2 β-strand. This β-hairpin insert extends 35 Å at a ~42° angle to the vertical axis and is the basis of the continuous β-sheet in the inner face of each FlgP concentric ring.

We have previously found that FlgQ is required for basal disk assembly, so wondered whether it is also a basal disk component22. We predicted its structure using AlphaFold2 (ref. 29), finding that it resembles a 2-protomer FlgP repeat (Fig. 2g). To clarify its location, we fused an mCherry tag to FlgQ and determined a subtomogram average structure. Although the mutant was motile, the structure featured no additional densities (Fig. 2h). We conclude that FlgQ is a low-abundance or irregular component, or an assembly chaperone.

The basal disk is adjacent to the outer face of the P-ring. While ascertaining the symmetry of the L- and P-rings was beyond the resolution of our map, cross-sections through L- and P-ring densities showed comparable radii to Salmonella12,13 (Fig. 2i). We cylindrically averaged our map by applying arbitrary high-order symmetry during focused refinement and compared these to low-pass filtered structures of similarly cylindrically averaged Salmonella LP-rings. The C. jejuni L- and P-rings have similar width to Salmonella (103% and 104% as wide, respectively) (Fig. 2i), and their sequences lack insertion and deletions, suggesting comparable stoichiometries. To experimentally probe the C. jejuni LP-ring stoichiometries, we looked for steps in flagellar rotation—in Salmonella and E. coli, interactions between the asymmetric rod and 26-fold symmetric LP-rings impose 26 steps on flagellar rotation12. We attached beads to truncated flagella, and upon slowing rotation by de-energizing cells with carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), observed 25 to 27 phase-invariant dwell positions (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 5). Taking these structural and biophysical observations together, we conclude that the C. jejuni LP-rings have not expanded to match the symmetry of the basal disk or other more recently evolved components and have a symmetry similar to the 26-fold symmetry of the Salmonella LP-rings. Although our density maps show close association of the P-ring with the basal disk, we previously showed that the basal disk can assemble even if pushed out of axial register with the P-ring by increasing the length of the FlgP N-terminal linker23. Together with their 17:26 symmetric mismatch, this indicates that the basal disk and P-ring do not form a stable complex, despite their proximity.

We neither saw evidence of YecR, which in Salmonella forms a belt around the LP-rings12, nor found a homologue in the C. jejuni genome, although an unidentified adjacent density hints at an as-yet-unidentified analogue (Fig. 2i).

We speculated that our map might help us understand the medial disk, a lattice between the basal and proximal disks of unknown composition (Fig. 3a). Our unpublished transposon insertion sequencing-based infection screen using C. jejuni NCTC11168 (ref. 32) revealed that polarly localized Cj1643 and Cj0892c are required for motility but not flagellar filament assembly, suggesting them as potential candidates. Co-immunoprecipitation with proximal disk component PflA in C. jejuni 81–176 recovered orthologues CJJ81176_1634 and CJJ81176_0901, respectively (Supplementary Table 1), which we renamed PflC and PflD (Paralyzed flagellum C and D) after subtomogram average structures revealed destablization of the proximal and medial disks upon deletion of pflC, and loss of a peripheral cage-like structure between the medial and proximal disks upon deletion of pflD (Fig. 3b).

PflC is a 364-residue periplasmic protein featuring an N-terminal serine protease domain followed by two PDZ-like domains. Generating an AlphaFold2 (ref. 29) model revealed 2 folding regions, PflCN (protease and PDZ1, residues 16–252) and PflCC (PDZ2, residues 265–364), connected by a proline-rich linker. By separately rigid-body docking PflCN and PflCC, we located 17 copies of PflC in the densities projecting from each third FlgP subunit of the first basal disk ring, yielding a map-model FSC of 9.3 Å at FSC = 0.5 (Fig. 3c, and Extended Data Figs. 2e, 3a,b and 4b). PflCC docks to the underside of the first ring of FlgP, while PflCN forms the inner band of the medial disk; a density corresponding to the linker bridges adjacent PflC protomers, indicating that the PflCC domain of one chain assembles with the PflCN domain of another in a daisy chain of domain-swapped protomers (Fig. 3c). PDZ domains usually interface with binding partners via a hydrophobic pocket, but PflCC interactions are unlikely to be mediated by canonical binding33 as its ligand-binding groove is oriented away from FlgP, lacks the conserved binding loop34, and is predicted to be occupied by residues from its own chain.

The remainder of the medial disk is a lattice of α-helices that we could interpret with 17 asymmetric units of 6 additional PflCN protomers in a lattice (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 2f). PflCN protomers could be docked into our density map with a map-model FSC of 9.7 Å at FSC = 0.5 (Extended Data Figs. 3a,c and 4c). We refer to the subunits in one asymmetric unit as PflC2–7; PflC2–6 form radial spokes with a slight twist, while PflC7 connects adjacent spokes. Pulldowns using FLAG-tagged PflC verified interactions with FlgP, while coIPs of FLAG-tagged proximal disk components PflA and PflB co-purified PflD (Fig. 3e). Supporting our modelling of PflC, we noted an additional rodlike density protruding from the location of N239 in all PflC protomers, which in a homolog from a closely related species is glycosylated with an N-linked heptasaccharide35 (red asterisks, Fig. 3f).

The PflC lattice consists of diverse oligomerization interfaces (Fig. 3f). Three types of symmetric dimerization interface have rotational axes perpendicular to the plane of the lattice: one in PflC2:PflC3 and PflC4:PflC5; one in PflC3:PflC4 and PflC5:PflC6; and a third in PflC3:PflC7, although the latter is substantially distorted. The remaining interfaces (PflC1:PflC1, PflC1:PflC2, PflC2:PflC7 and PflC7:PflC4) are asymmetric and differ in each case. Based on our findings with PflC1, the densities on the underside of the basal disk are probably the C-terminal PDZ domains of PflC2–7 (asterisks in Fig. 2a, opaque teal in 3a), although the lack of C17 symmetry renders linker helices invisible.

These promiscuous self–self interfaces predicted that PflC oligomerizes ex situ. Curiously, however, size exclusion chromatography (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b) and mass photometry (MP) (Extended Data Fig. 6c) of purified PflC revealed mainly monomers. This suggested that the domains of discrete PflC polypeptides might self-associate until the context of the motor facilitates correct assembly. To test this, we removed PflCC, which might inhibit oligomerization. Consistent with our speculation, PflC∆236–349 formed substantially more dimers than full-length PflC (Extended Data Fig. 6d–f). We speculate that interaction of PflCN and PflCC from the same polypeptide prevents cytoplasmic oligomerization, and binding to the basal disk facilitates medial disk assembly only in the context of the assembled motor. This would explain why we have never seen isolated PflC lattices in C. jejuni tomograms.

To better understand the origin of the PflC-based medial disk, which is absent from other Campylobacterota species, we performed a DALI search of PflC's predicted structure against the Protein Databank. Our search revealed that its protease:PDZ:PDZ domain architecture is similar to trypsin-like HtrA serine proteases36 (Fig. 3g). Indeed, despite 20% and 27% sequence identity between the N- and C-terminal regions of PflC and HtrA, respectively, PSI-BLAST of PflC against the non-redundant protein sequence database returned hits to serine proteases from the first iteration, and a hidden Markov model derived from PSI-BLAST alignments returned four significant hits in the C. jejuni proteome, with the highest confidence to PflC and HtrA (e-values of 2.4 × 10−108 and 3 × 10−57, respectively; HtrA is CJJ81176_1242). The two other hits were also to proteases (CJJ81176_1086 and CJJ81176_0539, with e-values of 6.7 × 10−8 and 3.2 × 10−6, respectively). Sequence-guided structural alignment of PflCN to C. jejuni HtrA yielded alignment of a core of 118 pruned residue pairs (of 216) with root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 2.448 Å (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Because PflCC is connected to PflCN by a flexible linker, we aligned it separately to the C-terminal PDZ domain of HtrA with RMSD between 42 pruned residue pairs (of 64) of 1.425 Å. The region of PflCN corresponding to the active site cleft of the serine protease domain is most divergent from HtrA (Extended Data Fig. 7c) and PflC lacks the catalytic triad residues His119, Asp150 and Ser224: the large loop that His119 occupies has been lost in PflC, Asp150 is replaced by Asn65, and although Ser224 aligns with PflC's Ser122, these residues do not align structurally (Extended Data Fig. 7d). This atrophy of the catalytic triad region, however, is the most substantial difference, and the global topologies of the two proteins are otherwise similar (Extended Data Fig. 8).

The second candidate medial disk component, PflD, is a 162-residue periplasmic protein that pulls down with PflA of the proximal disk (Supplementary Table 1). We inspected the peripheral part of the medial disk adjacent to PflC4 which disappeared when we deleted pflD, and found that a model of PflD was consistent with this density, despite the lower resolution of this area of our map yielding only a modest mean main chain correlation coefficient of 0.63 (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 3b). This location is consistent with our co-purification of PflD with both PflA and PflB (Fig. 3e).

Finally, we sought to interpret our density map of the proximal disk, which contains PflA, PflB and stator complex protein MotB17. Consistent with this, the proximal disk features the extensive short antiparallel α-helical motifs characteristic of the repetitive TPR motifs37,38 predicted for PflA and PflB (Fig. 4a).

Dashed red box denotes the asymmetric unit in c. c, Every asymmetric unit features 1 PflA, 1 PflB, 4 FliL and 1 stator complex (composed of 5 copies of MotA and 2 copies of MotB). PflA (light green) forms spokes whose N-terminal domain interacts with a rim of PflB (dark green) at the periphery of the scaffold. An arc of FliL (red) and periplasmic domain of MotB (pink, residues 68–247) are also evident at lower confidence.

To model PflA and PflB, we sought to fit their AlphaFold2 (ref. 29) predictions into our map. PflA was predicted to form an elongated superhelix consisting of 16 TPR motifs connected to an N-terminal β-sandwich domain by an unstructured linker, while PflB was mainly α-helical except two 5-residue β-strands. The predicted structure of a PflAB heterodimer (Extended Data Fig. 4d) indicated that PflA's N-terminal domain and linker wraps around PflB. We flexibly fitted these structures into our map, resulting in a structure in which 17 radial spokes of PflA position a continuous rim of 17 PflBs (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 2g). PflA fitted the map with a map-model FSC of 9.1 Å at FSC = 0.5 (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Similar to PflC, PflA is a glycoprotein, with N-linked glycans attached at N458 and N497 (ref. 39), and this modelling is validated by densities consistent with N-linked heptasaccharides emanating from our modelled locations of both residues (Fig. 4c, red atoms). The resolution of PflB was lower, presumably because it is more peripheral and flexible, with map-model mean main chain correlation coefficient of 0.71 (Extended Data Fig. 3b).

To test the prediction that PflAB heterodimer formation is mediated by the linker between the N- and C-terminal domains of PflA binding a TPR-superhelical groove in PflB, with the N-terminal β-sandwich domain wrapping around PflB and the C-terminal α-helical PflA spoke pointing toward the motor axis (Fig. 4c), we measured their interaction using mass photometry. PflAB heterodimerized even at nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 4e), while deleting the linker and β-sandwich domain of PflA (residues 16–168) abolished dimer formation (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 9). A subtomogram average structure of the motor in a PflAΔ16–168 mutant confirmed that PflB was unable to assemble into the motor (Fig. 4e), although the C-terminal end of PflA remained evident, unlike a full pflA deletion17 (Fig. 4g). Together with PflAB interaction seen in pulldowns40, we conclude that PflAB dimerization is essential for completion of proximal disk assembly.

Although our previous work and the topology of the globular periplasmic MotBC dimer make its location unambiguous17, the resolution of this region was low; this is presumably due to flexibility between this domain and the periplasmic portion of the helical linker between globular MotBC and its N-terminal transmembrane helix, meaning we could only crudely position a MotB model. This is consistent with the MotBC domain not being resolved in recent structures of purified MotA5B2 complexes10,11. The linker itself, however, was evident (Fig. 4c inset).

An arc of density partially encircling the periplasmic portion of the helical MotBN linker had similar radius and location as the tertiary structures of complete circles of FliL in other motors41,42; we found that a curved tetrameric homology model of FliL fitted into this arc with a mean main chain correlation coefficient of 0.61 (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 3b). Co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that FliL is found in pulldowns of PflA and PflB (Supplementary Table 1), suggesting that the FliL arc is augmented by PflB and PflA to scaffold MotB, and explains why PflA and PflB are both required for the high occupancy or static anchoring of stator complexes into the C. jejuni motor17. Indeed, we found that deletion of fliL in C. jejuni had only a modest impact on motility (Fig. 4d) in contrast to H. pylori where FliL is essential, reinforcing that FliL's role is partially fulfilled by PflA and PflB in C. jejuni. The presence of the stator complexes in the C. jejuni structure, in contrast to their absence in Salmonella, indicates either high occupancy or static anchoring, probably mediated by their interactions with PflA, PflB, FliL and unidentified cytoplasmic proteins.

We could not assign identities to three remaining densities in the scaffold: the so-called E-ring that spaces the MS-ring from PflA, a cage previously observed in H. pylori41 on the periphery of the PflB rim that extends through the membrane to wrap around the stator complexes, and a small density adjacent to PflD (Fig. 4a, opaque regions, single, double and triple asterisks, respectively).

To better understand the conserved torque-generation machinery, we focused on the stator complexes, C-ring and MS-ring. By symmetry expansion and classifying stator complexes from our whole-motor map, we observed a pentameric structure in contact with the C-ring that is directly beneath the periplasmic peptidoglycan-binding domain of MotB (Fig. 5a–c). In cross-section, the dimensions and shape of this density match MotA5 from the purified C. jejuni stator complex11 (Fig. 5c). The consistent rotational register of this pentameric density even after symmetry expansion and classification, with a pentameric corner pointing toward the C-ring, indicates that stator complexes are most frequently in this rotational register.

Both maps were low-pass filtered to 15 Å resolution and cylindrically averaged for like-for-like comparison with Bottom: cross-section through a composite map of the whole-motor C. jejuni map, with superimposed corresponding cross-sections through focused, cylindrically averaged C. jejuni MS-ring and C-ring maps (deposited as Additional data for EMD-16723), highlighting the wider 62-Å-radius β-collar.

We wondered how the C. jejuni rotor components, that is, the C-ring, MS-ring and rod, have adapted to interact with a wider ring of stator complexes. The C. jejuni C-ring is wider than that of Salmonella17; to ascertain its stoichiometry, we determined its structure by subtomogram averaging. To remove the strong 17-fold signal of MotA, we used a motile C. jejuni mutant whose stator complexes have lower occupancy than WT motors. Our subtomogram average revealed a 38-fold periodic structure whose vertical post-like architecture resembles that of the near-atomic-resolution Salmonella C-ring7,8,9 (Fig. 5d–f).

C-ring diameter is reliant on templating on the C terminus of the MS-ring protein FliF8,43. To examine possible mechanisms behind templating a wider C-ring, we compared the C. jejuni MS-ring to that from Salmonella. The distinctive FliF β-collar has a radius of ~51 Å in Salmonella (Fig. 5g, top). Focused refinement of the C. jejuni MS-ring with imposed C38 symmetry expected from 1:1 stoichiometry of FliF and FliG43,44 demonstrated a 62-Å-radius FliF β-collar (Fig. 5g, bottom). We could not resolve azimuthal features corresponding to discrete FliF subunits, but imposition of other arbitrary high-order symmetries did not alter the radius of FliF's β-collar. We conclude that the wider C-ring is achieved by C. jejuni assembling a wider MS-ring, which in turn templates the wider C-ring.

This study provides a near-complete structural inventory of the proteins incorporated into the C. jejuni motor during evolution of higher-torque output and adaptations of pre-existing components, providing insights into evolutionary origins and the universal principles of flagellar rotation (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 2). This work lays the foundation for understanding where these new proteins came from and how they became incorporated into a pre-existing machine.

A partial cut-away schematic of the structure of the C. jejuni flagellar motor contextualizing the protein components modelled in this study. The basal disk is formed of FlgP; the medial disk of PflC and PflD; and the proximal disk of PflA, PflB and FliL together with stator complex components MotA and MotB.

Our structures explain how the C. jejuni motor produces approximately three times the torque of the E. coli and Salmonella motors. We previously inferred from E. coli and Salmonella that a single stator complex exerts a force of 7.3 pN17. Given the approximation that torque from multiple stator complexes is additive45, the number of stator complexes, together with our force estimate and the radius at which stator complexes exert force on the C-ring make predictions that nicely explain observations of 3,600 pN nm torque for Campylobacterota flagellar motors (our structure-based prediction is 3,288 pN nm) versus observations ranging from 1,260 to 2,000 pN nm45,46 for E. coli and Salmonella flagellar motors (our structure-based prediction is 1,606 pN nm). For the C. jejuni motor to build this wider ring of additional stator complexes to produce its higher torque, the spoke-and-rim scaffold of PflA and PflB, anchored by PflC and PlflD, positions stator complexes in their wider ring. This scaffold facilitates the static positioning (or high occupancy) of the C. jejuni stator complexes17; the radius of the MS-ring is correspondingly larger than that of Salmonella to template a wider C-ring to maintain contact with the larger stator ring.

The structures of PflA and PflB hint at their possible origins. Both are composed of arrays of TPR motifs, which are widespread building blocks of structural scaffolds. The widespread nature of TPR motifs would have made them available for co-option to form PflA or PflB. Intriguingly, other flagellar proteins are homologous to parts of the widespread Tol/Pal cell-envelope maintenance system6, and the Tol/Pal component YbgF features TPR motifs47, making it tempting to contemplate a scenario in which PflA and PflB originated from another Tol/Pal co-option. Our structures support our previous speculation that PflA may be widespread among other species such as Bdellovibrio18.

In C. jejuni, the PflAB-containing proximal disk is linked to the basal disk by the PflC-composed medial disk, while other species lack a medial disk and have separate proximal and basal disks. Our structure provides a foundation for understanding the function and mechanism of the relatively recent evolution of the medial disk17. We recently showed that the basal disk buttresses the motor when unwrapping flagellar filaments from the cell body23. Here we identify PflC as the mediator of the extensive connections between the proximal and basal disks (Figs. 3 and 4). PflC's shared domain organization and structure with HtrA-family enzymes suggests that the medial disk originated as a co-option of an ancestral member of the HtrA family48. Indeed, HtrA family proteins are periplasmic, meaning that they already co-localized with the flagellar motor. Curiously, HtrA also forms higher-order oligomers36, suggesting that this oligomerization tendency may have been a pre-existing property easily exapted for its role as a structural scaffold.

The basal disk is comparatively ancient. While the basal disk protein FlgP comes from a broad protein family, ring oligomerization in the family correlates with the subset of sequences that feature a sequence insertion between the SHS2 α-helix and the second β-strand, as seen with outer membrane-associated rings formed by FlgT49. Curiously, the basal disk from Wolinella has been proposed to form a spiral, not concentric rings50, raising the possibility that FlgP forms concentric rings only in the presence of a medial disk.

Our study also provides clues to the universal mechanism of flagellar rotation. In our averaged structure, MotA5 pentamers all have similar rotational orientations relative to the C-ring, meaning that the majority of MotA pentamers are in this orientation, as averaging an unbiased range of orientations would yield a circle. This, on face value, is inconsistent with the dominant ‘cogwheel' model of the flagellar rotation mechanism, which posits that rotation of a MotA5 pentamer around its MotB anchor enables the pentamers to act as cogs that drive rotation of the larger C-ring cogwheel. This meshing means that MotA5 pentamers would always be engaged with the C-ring, that is, they would have a ‘high duty ratio'. Because the number of small cogs (17 in C. jejuni, 11 in E. coli and Salmonella) has a symmetry mismatch with the number of teeth in the big cog (38 in C. jejuni, 34 in E. coli and Salmonella), once assembled, each of the small cogs, which are evenly distributed around the circumference of the larger cog, would need to be rotationally orientated differently to enable all to mesh simultaneously with the symmetry-mismatched teeth of the larger cog. Thus in an averaged structure, MotA5 would appear as smooth circles, inconsistent with our observation.

We can imagine two explanations for this inconsistency. First, the symmetry mismatch might be capacitated by structural tolerances, such as flexibility in the so-called FliGC ‘torque helix' (a ‘tooth' of the large cog) that interacts with MotA, which would enable all pentamers to retain the same orientation while the FliGC cogteeth distort to facilitate maintaining the interface. Previous models of high-duty-ratio stator complexes cite tolerance from an elastic linker from peptidoglycan through MotB to MotA51, although this could not be universal, as species such as C. jejuni have stator complexes held rigidly in proteinaceous cages. With such tolerances, all cogs would rotate in unison to drive a single rotational step of the C-ring, all starting and finishing a work cycle in the orientation that we observe. Alternatively, the tolerances might be insufficiently broad to enable engagement of all stator complexes, in which case the duty ratio might be lower than a naïve interpretation of the cogwheel model suggests. A second explanation is that the cogwheel model does not adequately describe the mechanism underlying flagellar rotation. Indeed, a recent study hints that previous results suggesting a high stator complex duty ratio derived from artefacts from stator complex dissociation at low load, and that stator complexes actually have a low duty ratio52.

While our single-particle analysis approach achieves substantially higher resolution than previous studies, our approach is not without limitations. Our study focused on the 17-fold rotationally symmetric periplasmic scaffold, but flagella feature diverse symmetry-mismatched subcomponents. The approach can in principle identify arbitrary symmetries, but we did not resolve other substructures such as the C-ring, which instead required a subtomogram averaging approach, probably due to excess noise owing to the size, heterogeneity and the in situ context. Different data acquisition schemes are needed to understand how to extract signal. Nevertheless, using minicells to study polar machinery has promise for increases in resolution in other systems, including Tad pili53 in Caulobacter crescentus minicells54, type II secretion systems55 in Pseudomonas minicells56, chemoreceptors in C. jejuni57 and flagellar motors in other polar flagellates58,59.

Our approach builds a foundation to study molecular evolution mechanisms and provides information on how torque is generated. Our approach confirms that imaging protein machines in situ can provide subnanometre resolution without sectioning, and lays a foundation for future studies expanding to other symmetry elements and structures.

Plasmids and strains generated in this study (see Supplementary Table 3) are available from the lead author.

C. jejuni 81–176 or NCTC11168 were cultured from frozen stocks on Mueller–Hinton (MH) agar (1.5% w/v) supplemented with trimethoprim (10 μg ml−1) (MHT) for 1–2 days at 37 °C under microaerophilic conditions (5% O2, 10% CO2, 85% N2) in a Heracell 150i trigas incubator (Thermo Fisher). Additional antibiotics were added to the agar medium when required: kanamycin at 50 μg ml−1, streptomycin at 2 mg ml−1. All 81–176 mutants were constructed in DRH212 (ref. 60), a streptomycin-resistant derivative of C. jejuni 81–176, which is the reference wildtype strain in this work unless otherwise stated. When working with E. coli, cultures were grown at 37 °C on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates (1.5% w/v) or in LB medium with agitation, both supplemented with carbenicillin at 100 μg ml−1. Please see Supplementary Table 3 for details of strains and plasmids used in this study.

The minicell (∆flhG ∆flaAB) and PflA truncation (pflAΔ18–168) strains were constructed as described previously60,61. Briefly, aphA-rpsLWT cassettes flanked by ~500 bp overhangs with homology to the targeted chromosomal loci and EcoRI sites at the 5' and 3' termini were synthesized by ‘splicing by overlap extension' PCR. Linear DNA fragments were methylated at their EcoRI sites with EcoRI methyltransferase (New England Biolabs) and transformed into C. jejuni using the biphasic method62. Transformants were selected for on MH agar supplemented with 50 µg ml−1 kanamycin. Replacement of the aphA-rpsLWT with the desired mutation was achieved using the same method, but with transformants being selected for on MH agar supplemented with 2 mg ml−1 streptomycin sulphate. Kanamycin-sensitive, streptomycin-resistant transformants were single-colony purified and checked by Sanger sequencing (Source Bioscience). For the minicell background, in-frame deletion of flhG left the first and last 20 codons intact, while the ∆flaAB allele spanned from 20 base pairs upstream of the flaA translational start site to codon 548 of flaB.

To construct the C. jejuni fliL mutant, we made a cat insertional knockout and confirmed absence of polar effects. To preserve expression of the essential acpS gene downstream of fliL, we constructed a fliL mutant that disrupted fliL with an antibiotic-resistance cassette containing an intact flaA promoter positioned to maintain expression of acpS. First, the fliL locus from C. jejuni 81–176 was PCR amplified with an HpaI site engineered within the fliL coding sequence. This fragment was then cloned into the BamHI site of pUC19 to create pDAR1712. The flaA promoter and start codon were PCR amplified from C. jejuni 81–176 and cloned into the XbaI and BamHI sites of pUC19 to create pDAR2039. The chloramphenicol-resistance cassette containing cat was digested as a PstI fragment from pRY109 and cloned into PstI-digested pDAR2039 to create pDAR2045. The cat-flaA promoter was then digested from pDAR2045 as an EcoRI-BamHI fragment, treated with T4 DNA polymerase to create blunt ends and cloned into the HpaI site of pDAR1712 to create pDAR2072. pDAR2072 was verified to contain the cat-flaA promoter in the correct orientation to maintain expression of acpS. DRH212 was then electroporated with pDAR2072 and chloramphenicol-resistance transformants were recovered. Colony PCR verified creation of a fliL mutant (DAR2076).

Deletion mutants of C. jejuni NCTC11168 were constructed by double-crossover homologous recombination with an antibiotic-resistance cassette to remove most of the coding sequence using overlap PCR products. As an example, deletion of cj1643 (pflC) is described. First, ~500 bp upstream of the cj1643 start codon was amplified using CSO-3359/3360 and ~500 bp downstream of the cj1643 stop codon was amplified with CSO-3361/-3362 from genomic DNA (gDNA) of the wildtype strain (CSS-0032). A non-polar kanamycin-resistance cassette (aphA-3, KanR) was amplified from pGG1 (ref. 63) with primers HPK1/HPK2. To fuse the up- and downstream regions of cj1643 with the resistance cassette, the three fragments were mixed and subjected to overlap-extension PCR with CSO-3359/3362. PCR products were electroporated into the WT strain as previously described64. The final deletion strain (CSS-4087; NCTC11168 ∆cj1643) was verified by colony PCR with CSO-3363/HPK2. Deletion of cj0892c (pflD) in C. jejuni strain NCTC11168 was generated in a similar fashion: cj0892c::aphA-3 (CSS-4081; NCTC11168 ∆cj0892c).

To fuse sfgfp to the penultimate codon of cj0892c (pflD), its coding sequence was first amplified with CSO-3611/3612, digested with NseI/ClaI and inserted into similarly digested pSE59.1 (ref. 65), which had been amplified with CSO-0347/CSO-0760, to generate pSSv106.5, where cj0892c transcription was driven from the metK promoter. The plasmid was verified by colony PCR with CSO-0644/3270 and sequencing with CSO-0759. Next, sfgfp was amplified from its second codon from pXG10-SF66 with CSO-3279/3717, digested with ClaI and ligated to pSSv106.5 (amplified with CSO-3766/0347 and also digested with ClaI). This generated pSSv114.1, which was verified by colony PCR with CSO-0644/0593 and sequencing with CSO-0759/3270. The fusion of rdxA::PmetK-cj0892c-sfGFP was amplified from pSSv114.1 with CSO-2276/2277 and introduced into the rdxA locus of ∆cj0892c (CSS-4081) by electroporation. Clones were verified via colony PCR and sequencing with CSO-0349 and CSO-0644. Colony PCR was also used to confirm retention of the original deletion with CSO-3343 and HPK2.

Similar to construction of deletion mutants, C-terminal epitope-tagged strains were generated by homologous recombination at the native locus by electroporation of a DNA fragment. The 3×FLAG sequence was fused to the penultimate codon of the coding sequence to allow in-frame translation of the tag. The DNA fragment contained ~500 bp upstream of the penultimate codon of the gene of interest, the sequence of the epitope tag, a non-polar resistance cassette and the ~500 bp downstream sequence of the gene. As an example, 3×FLAG tagging of PflA (CSS-5714) is described. The upstream fragment was amplified with CSO-4224 and CSO-4225 from C. jejuni NCTC11168 WT gDNA. The downstream fragment was amplified using CSO-4226 and CSO-4227. The fusion of the 3×FLAG tag with the gentamicin-resistance cassette was amplified from fliW::3xFLAG-aac(3)-IV63 using CSO-0065 and HPK2. Next, a three-fragment overlap PCR using CSO-4224 and CSO-4227 was performed and the resulting PCR product was electroporated into CSS-4666. The obtained clones were validated by PCR using CSO-4223 and HPK2 and by sequencing using CSO-4223. PflB-3×FLAG (CSS-5716) and PflC-3×FLAG (CSS-4720) were generated similarly. The 3×FLAG with a non-polar kanamycin-resistance cassette was amplified from csrA::3×FLAG-aphA-3 (ref. 63).

To construct a FlgQ-mcherry fusion protein for expression, a 76-bp DNA fragment containing the cat promoter and start codon with an in-frame BamHI site from pRY109 was amplified by PCR and cloned into the XbaI and XmaI sites of pRY112 to create pDAR1003. PCR was then used to amplify mcherry from codon to the stop codon, which was then inserted into XmaI and EcoRV sites of pDAR1003 to create pDAR1006. This plasmid contains a start codon that is in-frame with DNA for BamHI and XmaI sites followed by the mcherry coding sequence. Primers were then designed and used for PCR to amplify flgQ from codon 2 to the stop codon from C. jejuni 81–176. This fragment was inserted in-frame into the BamHI site of pDARH1006 to create pDRH7476, which was then conjugated into DRH2071 to result in DRH7516.

C. jejuni ΔflhG ΔflaAB cells were grown on MH plates and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4). Cells were spun at 1,500 × g for 20 min to pellet whole cells. The minicell-enriched supernatant was removed and spun in a tabletop microcentrifuge at 21,000 × g for 5 min to pellet the minicells. The pellet was then resuspended to a theoretical optical density (OD)600 of ~15.

Minicells were vitrified on QUANTIFOIL R0.6/1 or R1.2/1.3 holey carbon grids (Quantifoil Micro Tools) using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher).

For electron cryo-tomography and subtomogram averaging, whole cells were grown on MHT agar, restreaked on fresh plates and grown overnight before use. Freshly grown cells were suspended into ~1.5 ml of PBS buffer and concentrated to an approximate theoretical OD600 of 10 by pelleting at 1,500 × g for 5 min on a tabletop microcentrifuge and resuspending appropriately. Of the concentrated cell sample, 30 μl was mixed with 10 nm gold fiducial beads coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Of this mixture, 3 μl was applied to freshly glow-discharged QUANTIFOIL R2/2, 300 mesh grids. Grids were plunge frozen in liquified ethane–propane using a Vitrobot mark IV.

Micrographs of the minicell sample were collected using 300 keV Thermo Fisher Titan Krios TEMs across two sessions using EPU acquisition software. The first dataset was collected on a microscope with a Falcon III direct electron detector (Thermo Fisher), the second dataset using a K2 direct electron detector equipped with a GIF energy filter (Gatan), using a slit width of 20 eV. Due to our large particle size relative to that of the holes, we collected one shot per hole. Gain correction was performed on the fly. Details of data-collection parameters are described in Extended Data Table 1.

Tilt series of motors in pflAΔ18–168 were collected using a 300 keV Titan Krios TEM (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a K2 direct electron detector and a GIF energy filter (Gatan) using a slit width of 20 eV. Data were collected in Tomography 5 (Thermo Fisher) using a dose-symmetric tilt scheme across ±57° in 3° increments. We used a dose of 3 e− Å−2 per tilt, distributed across 4 movie frames. Pixel size was 2.2 Å and defocus range from −4.0 to −5.0 μm. To determine the C. jejuni C-ring architecture, tilt series of 194 motors in DRH8754 were collected using a 200 keV Glacios TEM (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a Falcon 4 direct electron detector and a Selectris energy filter (Thermo Fisher) using a slit width of 10 eV. Data were collected in Leginon automated data-collection software using a dose-symmetric tilt scheme across ±51° in 3° increments. We used a dose of 2.7 e− Å−2 per tilt, distributed across 5 movie frames. Pixel size was 1.9 Å and defocus was −4.0 μm. All other tilt-series datasets were acquired on a 200 keV FEI Tecnai TF20 FEG transmission electron microscope (FEI) equipped with a Falcon II direct electron detector camera (FEI) using Gatan 914 or 626 cryoholders. Tilt series were recorded from −57° to +57° with an increment of 3° collected defocus of approximately −4 μm using Leginon automated data-collection software at a nominal magnification of ×25,000 and were binned two times. Cumulative doses of ∼120 e− Å−2 were used. Overnight data collection was facilitated by the addition of a 3 litre cold-trap Dewar flask and automated refilling of the Dewar cryoholder triggered by a custom-written Leginon node interfaced with a computer-controlled liquid nitrogen pump (Norhof LN2 Systems).

Movie frames were aligned and dose weighted according to exposure, as implemented in MotionCor2 (v.2.1)67. All subsequent processing was done in RELION (3.1)68,69. Contrast transfer function (CTF) correction was performed using CTFFIND4 (ref. 70), using the RELION wrapper. Flagellar motor positions were picked manually, yielding 79,287 particle coordinates for the K2 dataset and 14,605 particle coordinates for the F3 dataset.

The two datasets were first processed separately in RELION 3.1 before merging for a final round of refinement. For the K2 dataset, 79,287 particles were extracted at a box size of 800 px. A round of 2D classification removed junk and membrane particles, and an initial model was created using these particles with imposed C17 symmetry, which is known from past structural characterization of the motor by subtomogram averaging17. A round of mask-free 3D classification and refinement with applied C17 symmetry produced the first consensus refinement. A total of 27,164 particles were then re-extracted, centring on the periplasmic structures. After another round of 3D classification, 19,736 particles were refined in C17 symmetry to produce a whole-motor reconstruction at 9.88 Å using gold-standard refinement. For the F3 data, 14,605 particles were extracted at a box size of 1,000 px rescaled to 500 px. They underwent 2D classification to remove junk, 3D classification and refinement to arrive at an initial consensus 3D structure. The particles were again recentred on the periplasmic structures and underwent another round of refinement. Finally, the 13,054 particles were re-extracted at an unbinned 1,000 px box size for a final round of refinement. The two recentred refined datasets were merged, assigning them different RELION 3.1 optics groups, and refined to a global resolution of 9.36 Å (32,790 total particles).

Signal subtraction was used to further refine the structure of the periplasmic scaffold. A mask encompassing the regions of interest was made by segmenting and smoothing the whole-motor map using UCSF Chimera (1.16)71,72 and its Segger plugin73, binarizing and adding a soft-edge in RELION 3.1. The mask included the periplasmic scaffold and first ring of the basal disk, as the scaffold appears to attach onto it. This mask was used to computationally remove signal outside of the periplasmic regions of interest, as implemented in RELION 3.1. The signal subtraction and subsequent masked classification and refinement were conducted for the combined dataset, as well as K2 and F3 datasets separately. The highest resolution was reached with the merged data, with the periplasmic scaffold map reaching 7.68 Å from 32,790 particles.

The periplasmic scaffold map was post processed using LAFTER74 as implemented in the CCP-EM 1.6.0 software suite75 to suppress noise and enhance signal between the half maps. The LAFTER-filtered map of the scaffold was used for docking and modelling of periplasmic regions.

After convergence of the full-motor refinement in C17 symmetry, focused refinement of the MS-, LP- and C-rings was carried out using a lathed map lacking azimuthal features. The C17 map was lathed by applying C360 symmetry using EMAN2, producing a map with axial and radial features but no azimuthal features. This map was used as a reference for asymmetric refinement, so that no bias towards a particular cyclic symmetry could be imposed.

For the LP-ring, a tubular mask covering the LP-ring was used for signal subtraction and focused refinement. Subtracted particles were recentred on the LP-ring in a smaller 256-pixel box. A recentred subvolume of the full lathed map was used for the initial reference. Refinement with imposition of C26 symmetry produced the LP-ring localized reconstruction.

For the MS-ring, a tubular mask covering the MS-ring was used for signal subtraction and focused refinement. Subtracted particles were recentred on the MS-ring in a smaller 256-pixel box. A recentred subvolume of the full lathed map was used for the initial reference. Refinement with imposition of C38 symmetry produced the MS-ring localized reconstruction.

For the C-ring, a toroidal mask covering the C-ring was used for signal subtraction and focused refinement against the full-size lathed motor map. Refinement with imposition of C38 symmetry produced the C-ring localized reconstruction. This map was then post processed and sharpened with an empirically determined B factor of −1,200 Å−2.

From the full-motor refinement in C17 symmetry, particles were symmetry expanded and rewindowed into a smaller 360-pixel box centred on a stator complex, with subtraction of the surrounding signal using a spherical mask encompassing a triplet of neighbouring stator complexes. Classification without alignment produced the stator maps shown.

Fiducial models were generated and tilt series were aligned for tomogram reconstruction using the IMOD package76. Tomo3D77 was used to reconstruct tomograms with the SIRT (Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique) method due to approximately 1 particle per tomogram. All steps were automated by in-house custom scripts.

Subtomogram averaging was performed using the Dynamo package78 unless otherwise stated. Motors were picked using 3dmod from the IMOD suite and imported into Dynamo as ‘oriented particles' using an in-house script, and subtomograms were extracted for averaging. For each structure, an initial model was obtained by reference-free averaging of the oriented particles, with randomized Z-axis rotation to alleviate missing wedge artefacts. This initial model was used for a first round of alignment and averaging steps, implementing an angular search and translational shifts, with cone diameter and shift limits becoming more stringent across iterations. The resulting average was used as a starting model for a round of masked alignment and averaging. In this round, custom alignment masks were implemented, focusing on the periplasmic and inner-membrane-associated parts of the motor. This excluded dominant features that would otherwise drive the alignment, most prominently the outer membrane and extracellular hook. A 17-fold rotational averaging was applied. The final pflAΔ18–168 average was derived from 103 particles, the ∆pflC average from 101 particles, ∆pflD average from 195 particles, and the flgQ-mCherry average from 155 particles.

The C. jejuni C-ring subtomogram average using DRH8754 used the PEET package79. Tomograms were CTF corrected using IMOD, motors picked using 3dmod and subtomograms extracted for averaging in PEET. After an initial C1 whole-motor alignment, a subsequent alignment recentred on the tightly masked C-ring was performed. To capitalize on the redundancy of C-ring archecture and to increase the number of particles, each motor was then symmetry expanded so that the C-ring beneath each of the 17 asymmetric units could be treated as a separate particle. Subsequent alignment and classification to remove poorly aligned particles yielded the final structure.

Signal sequences predicted with SignalP (6.0)80 were removed from all sequences before modelling. ColabFold81, the community-run implementation of AlphaFold2 (ref. 29), was used to create structural models of PflA, PflB, a dimer of PflA-PflB, PflC, PflD, FlgP (as a monomer, trimer and heptamer), FlgQ, FliL and a dimer of MotBC (with transmembrane residues 1–67 removed).

The PflAB dimer model was created by merging two predicted structures: that of a dimer of PflA residues 16–455 and PflB residues 113–820, and full-length PflA.

For regions where α-helices and β-sheets were resolved, we refined our AlphaFold-predicted protein models into the scaffold map using ISOLDE82 in UCSF Chimera X 1.6. We imposed torsion, secondary structure and reference distance restraints in our modelling due to resolution limitations. The PflB chain of the PflAB dimer was rigidly docked into the map, the PflA chain was refined into the appropriate density and any clashes resolved. Models of FlgP multimers showed that each subunit interacts with subunits i − 1 and i − 2. To avoid artefacts due to this, a heptamer of FlgP was docked into the innermost basal disk ring and then refined into the map. Two subunits were then removed from each end, resulting in a fitted FlgP trimer. The PflC model was first separated into three domains, PflCN (residues 16–252), linker (253–263) and PflCC (264–364). Each domain was rigidly docked into its appropriate density, the three chains merged and the resulting protein was fitted using ISOLDE to resolve clashes or poor geometry at merging points. Six copies of PflCN were rigidly docked into an asymmetric unit of PflC lattice in the medial disk, forming PflC2–7. PflD, MotB and an arc of FliL were rigidly docked into the LAFTER-filtered scaffold map.

We used ‘phenix.validation_cryoem' of the Phenix package83 to evaluate map and model quality for PflA, PflB, PflC, PflC2–7, PflD, FlgP trimer, MotB dimer and FliL. For each model, a soft mask of the region was first created and applied to the map. The resulting masked volume and corresponding structural model were input to ‘phenix.validation_cryoem' which generated map-model FSC plots or cross-correlation scores.

WT C. jejuni and DAR2076 were grown from freezer stocks on MH agar containing trimethoprim for 48 h in microaerobic conditions at 37 °C. Strains were restreaked on MH agar containing trimethoprim and grown for 16 h at 37 °C in microaerobic conditions. After growth, strains were resuspended from plates and diluted to an OD600 of 0.8. Strains were then stabbed in MH motility agar (0.4% agar), incubated at 37 °C in microaerobic conditions for 30 h and assessed for migration from the point of inoculation.

The C. jejuni bead assay strain was constructed by deleting flaA (to shorten the flagellar filament), making a cysteine substitution in flaB (to allow for filament biotinylation via a malemide-PEG2-biotin linker (Thermo Scientific)) making an alanine substitution in flhF (which moves motors to a subpolar position permitting better bead coupling), and deleting cheY (to prevent motor switching). From frozen stocks, this strain was cultured on MH agar (1.4% w/v) supplemented with trimethoprim (10 μg ml−1) overnight at 37 °C in a pouch with a gas-controlling sachet (EZ CampyPouch System BD, 260685) and a damp paper towel. The growth from this culture was restreaked onto another plate and grown in the same conditions overnight. Passages to new plates on the following 2 days were optionally made to propagate the culture for multiple days of experiments.

After growth, bacteria were washed off the plate with MH broth and washed twice with PBS (centrifuged for 2 min at 8,900 × g) to create a 500 μl suspension of OD600 = 2. Next, 25 μl of 20 mM malemide-PEG2-biotin linker in PBS was added and left to react for 10 min. The bacteria were then washed twice more in PBS. A custom tunnel slide composed of a slide with two drilled holes, a parafilm spacer and another glass slide was constructed and connected to a peristaltic pump (Lambda Multiflow) to draw flow through the slide. Poly-l-lysine solution (Sigma-Aldrich, P4707) was flowed into the slide channel and left for 5 min to coat the glass surface. Excess poly-l-lysine was flushed with PBS. Bacteria were added and left for 5 min to settle on the surface. Unattached bacteria were flushed sequentially with PBS and MH broth. Beads (1,300 nm diameter, streptavidin-coated) (Sigma-Aldrich, 49532) were washed once in PBS and dispersed in MH broth. Beads were added to the flow slide and left for 5 min to settle and conjugate to filaments. Excess beads were flushed away with MH broth. Spinning beads were observed with a bright-field microscope with a high numerical aperture (NA) objective (×100, 1.46 NA, Zeiss, 420792-9800-720) and recorded with a high-speed scientific complementary metal-oxide semiconductor camera (Optronis CL600X2-FULL-M-FM). Positions of slowly rotating beads attached to cells treated with CCCP at concentrations of 0–5 μM in MH broth revealed preferred phase-invariant dwell positions.

C. jejuni proteins for recombinant expression in E. coli were cloned into the pLIC plasmid backbone, which confers resistance to ampicillin and places the gene of interest under an isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible T7 promoter for high levels of controlled expression. We used WT C. jejuni genomic DNA as template for gene amplification (extracted using the Wizard genomic DNA purification kit by Promega), and the Gibson Assembly method84 to seamlessly assemble all plasmid constructs. For all constructs, primer pairs were designed to amplify (1) the pLIC backbone and (2) the gene to be expressed, while also introducing a 25~30 bp complementary overlap between the two fragments. The pLIC plasmid primers also introduced an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. After vector linearization and purification of PCR product, it was digested with DpnI (New England Biolabs) to remove template vector.

The resulting linear DNA fragments were assembled using the Gibson Assembly master mix (New England Biolabs). Of the mix, 5 μl was added to 15–20 fmol of linearized vector and 4× excess of insert, and topped up to 10 μl with double-distilled water (ddH2O). The tube was incubated at 50 °C for 15 min and kept on ice until transformation.

Before transformation, 30 μl of ddH2O was added to the 10 μl reaction. Of the diluted Gibson mix, 2 μl was added to 25 μl of chemically competent E. coli DH5α and transformed using the heat shock method85. The entire volume of the tube was then plated onto a carbenicillin-supplemented LB agar plate.

After confirmation by Sanger sequencing (Source Bioscience), each assembled construct was isolated from the cloning strain (QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit, QIAGEN) and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for recombinant overexpression.

All proteins encoded on pLIC expression vectors were purified using the same protocol. A small (5 ml) overnight liquid culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying the appropriate expression vector was prepared and diluted 1:50 in 1,000 ml of LB medium. Shaking at 37 °C, the culture was grown to OD600 of 0.4–0.6, after which protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mM IPTG. Temperature was reduced to 18 °C and protein was expressed overnight.

Cells were collected at 5,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. All subsequent steps were done on ice using buffers chilled to 4 °C. The cell pellet was gently resuspended in ~35 ml of wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, pH 7.5). DNase and protease inhibitor were added (cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Roche). Cells were lysed using a LM10 Microfluidizer Processor cell disrupter (Analytik) at 15,000 psi. Lysate was centrifuged at 17,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min to pellet debris. The resulting supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter (Whatman).

A 5 ml HisTrap HP affinity chromatography nickel column (Cytiva) was first equilibrated with wash buffer. Supernatant was loaded onto the column with a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 3 ml min−1 The column was washed with 50 ml of wash buffer and then transferred onto a Fast protein liquid chromatography system (Bio-Rad). The column was further washed until the UV trace was flat. Then, protein was eluted from the column using a high-imidazole buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH 7.5) at a flow rate of 2 ml min−1 using ‘reverse flow'.

The purified protein was kept at 4 °C or flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for longer-term storage before characterizing them by mass photometry.

Analytical size exclusion of PflC and PflCN (∆236–349) was performed with an ENrich SEC 650 column (Bio-Rad), equilibrated with 1× PBS at a flow rate of 0.1 ml min−1 and a total sample injection volume of 400 µl. The column was calibrated using the Protein Standard Mix 15–600 kDa (Supelco, 69385). Absorption was recorded at 280, 220 and 495 nm to follow elution profiles and plotted using GraphPad Prism.

C. jejuni PflC (CJJ81176_1634) was used as seed for a PSI-BLAST search86 against the NCBI clustered non-redundant protein sequence database (nr_clustered, 5 December 2024) using default settings. After four iterations using default settings, the top 500 hits were used to build an HMM using hmmbuild from the hmmer 3.3 package87. This HMM was then used with hmmsearch to search predicted proteins from C. jejuni 81–176 (ASM1552v1).

Microscope coverslips (24 × 60 mm, Carl Roth) and CultureWell Gaskets (CW- 50R-1.0, 50-3 mm diameter × 1 mm depth) were cleaned with alternating ddH2O and 100% isopropanol washes, then dried roughly with pressurized air and left to dry further overnight at room temperature. Before use, gaskets were assembled onto coverslips and placed on the lens of a OneMP mass photometer (Refeyn) with immersion oil.

For each measurement, a gasket was first filled with 18 μl of PBS buffer and the instrument was focused. Then, 2 μl of sample was added to the droplet and rapidly mixed by pipetting. Measurements were then started using AcquireMP v.1.2.1 (Refeyn). For each measurement, data were acquired for 60 s at 100 frames per second. Mass photometry data were processed and analyzed in DiscoverMP software v.1.2.3 (Refeyn).

Measurements were conducted using affinity chromatography-purified proteins diluted to 200–800 nM, calculated from absorption at 280 nm. Of sample, 2 μl was added to 18 μl PBS droplet and mixed. For measurements of hetero-oligomers, the different proteins were first combined and mixed in a separate tube and subsequently applied to the PBS droplet. MP measurements were calibrated against molecular masses of commercial NativeMark unstained protein standards (Thermo Fisher). A volume of 1 μl of NativeMark was diluted 30-fold in PBS and 2 μl of this solution was added to 18 μl PBS for measurement. Detected peaks corresponded to 66 kDa, 146 kDa, 480 kDa and 1,048 kDa, and were used to calibrate subsequent measurements in DiscoverMP.

Chromosomally epitope-tagged fusions of PflC-3×FLAG (CSS-4720) or PflA-3×FLAG and PflD-sfGFP (CSS-5714), and PflB-3×FLAG and PflD-sfGFP (CSS-5716) were used together with the untagged C. jejuni NCTC11168 WT (CSS-0032) and PflD-sfGFP only (CSS-4666) as controls for immunoprecipitation. Co-purification of FlgP or PflD-sfGFP was investigated by western blot (WB) analysis using FlgP-specific antisera22 or an anti-GFP antibody (Roche, 11814460001, RRID: AB_390913), respectively. In brief, strains were grown to an OD600 of 0.6, and 60 OD600 of cells were collected (4,600 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) and washed in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 mM MgCl2, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol). In parallel, 1 OD600 of cells was collected as ‘culture' control and boiled in 1× protein loading buffer (PL; 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.01% (w/v) bromophenol blue; 8 min at 95 °C, shaking at 1,000 r.p.m.). Next, 60 OD600 cell pellets were lysed with a FastPrep system (MP Biomedical, matrix B, 1 × 4 m s−1, 10 s) in 1 ml lysis buffer [buffer A including 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche), 20 U DNase I (Thermo Fisher), 200 U RNase Inhibitor (moloX and Triton X-100, 2 µl ml−1 lysis buffer)]. Cleared lysates (14,500 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) were incubated with 35 µl anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804-1MG, RRID: AB_262044) for 30 min at 4 °C with rotation. Before and after incubation, a 1 OD600 aliquot was taken aside as lysate and supernatant 1 samples. Lysates with anti-FLAG antibody were then incubated for an additional 30 min (4 °C, rotating) with 75 µl per sample pre-washed (3× in buffer A) Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich, P6649). Afterwards, the supernatant/unbound fraction was removed after centrifugation (15,000 × g, 1 min, 4 °C; supernatant 2) and Protein A-Sepharose beads with bound proteins were washed 5× with buffer A. Elution of the bound proteins was performed with boiling of the beads in 400 µl 1× PL (8 min at 95 °C, 1,000 r.p.m.). Six volumes of acetone were used to precipitate eluted proteins overnight at −20 °C. Next, precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation (21,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C), air-dried and resuspended in 1× PL. Culture, lysate, supernatants 1 and 2, wash (aliquots corresponding to 0.1 OD600) and eluate samples (corresponding to 10 OD600) were analysed by WB. Western blots were performed as described previously63 and probed with the appropriate primary antibodies (anti-FLAG, anti-GFP (1:1,000 in 3% BSA/TBS-T)) or FlgP antisera (1:20,000 in 3% BSA/TBS-T) and secondary antibodies (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-conjugate (1:10,000) in 3% BSA/TBS-T; GE Healthcare, RPN4201 and RPN4301, respectively).

Plasmids were constructed with specific promoters for expression of FLAG-tagged proteins in C. jejuni mutants for co-immunoprecipitation experiments. To express a C-terminal FLAG-tagged PflA protein, a 206-base-pair DNA fragment from C. jejuni 81–176 (containing the promoter for flaA encoding the major flagellin with its start codon and an in-frame SpeI restriction site followed by an in-frame BamHI restriction site) was amplified by PCR. This fragment was cloned into the XbaI and BamHI sites of pRY108 to result in pDAR1425. Primers were then constructed to amplify DNA from codon 2 to the penultimate codon of pflA from C. jejuni 81–176 with an in-frame C-terminal FLAG tag epitope and stop codon. This DNA fragment was then cloned into the BamHI site of pDAR1425 so that pflA-FLAG was expressed from the flaA promoter to create pDAR3417. As a control, a 229-base-pair DNA fragment from C. jejuni 81–176 (containing the promoter for flaA encoding the major flagellin with its start codon and DNA encoding an in-frame FLAG tag epitope followed by an in-frame BamHI restriction site) was cloned into the XbaI and BamHI sites of pRY108 to create pDAR1604. pDAR1604 and pDAR3417 were then moved into DH5a/pRK212.1 for conjugation into DAR1124. Transconjugants were selected for on media with kanamycin and verified to contain the correct plasmids to result in DAR3447 and DAR3477.

To express a C-terminal FLAG-tagged PflB protein, primers were constructed to amplify DNA from codon 2 to the penultimate codon of pflB from C. jejuni 81–176 with an in-frame C-terminal FLAG tag epitope and stop codon. This DNA fragment was then cloned into the BamHI site of pECO102 so that pflB-FLAG was expressed from the cat promoter to create pDAR3414. pDAR965 and pDAR3414 were then moved into DH5a/pRK212.1 for conjugation into DAR981. Transconjugants were selected for on media containing chloramphenicol and verified to contain the correct plasmids to result in DAR3451 and DAR3479.

C. jejuni ΔpflA and ΔpflB mutants containing plasmids to express a FLAG-tag alone or C-terminal FLAG-tagged PflA or PflB proteins were grown from freezer stocks on MH agar containing chloramphenicol for 48 h in microaerobic conditions at 37 °C. Each strain was restreaked onto two MH agar plates containing chloramphenicol and grown for 16 h at 37 °C in microaerobic conditions. After growth, strains were resuspended from plates in PBS and centrifuged for 10 min at 5,210 × g. Each cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of PBS. Formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 0.1% and suspensions were gently mixed for 30 min at room temperature to crosslink proteins. After crosslinking, 0.4 ml of 1 M glycine was added to each sample and suspensions were then gently mixed for 10 min at room temperature to quench the crosslinking reaction. Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 5,210 × g. Cells were then disrupted by osmotic lysis and FLAG-tagged proteins with associated interacting proteins were immunoprecipitated with α-FLAG M2 affinity resin as previously described88,89.

To identify potential proteins interacting with PflA and PflB, resin with immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in SDS-loading buffer and electrophoresed on a 4–20% TGX stain-free gel (Bio-Rad) for 10 min. The gel was then stained with Coomassie blue for 30 min and then destained overnight. After equilibration of the gel in dH2O for 30 min, a 1 cm region of the gel containing a majority of the co-immunoprecipitated proteins was excised and diced into 1 mm pieces and then submitted for analysis by LC–MS/MS. After identification of proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with the FLAG-tagged bait protein and with the resin from the FLAG-tag only sample (the negative control), a ratio for each protein was determined by dividing the abundance of each protein detected in the FLAG-tagged bait protein sample by the abundance of each protein in the negative control. The top 20 proteins with the highest ratios for co-immunoprecipitation with the FLAG-tagged bait proteins are reported. The top 20 proteins that co-immunoprecipitated only with the FLAG-tagged bait proteins and were not detected in the negative control samples are also reported with their respective raw abundance counts.

(a) Simplified flowchart showing the generation of cryoEM volumes. (b) Central slice through the refined whole-motor structure. (c) FSC curve for B. (d) and (e) show slices through the volume of the refined, signal-subtracted periplasmic scaffold. (f) FSC curve for D, E.

(a) Context of the periplasmic scaffold focussed refinement map (EMD-16724) in the context of the whole motor map (EMD-16723). (b) Structure of the periplasmic scaffold density in isolation. (c) Location of one asymmetric unit from the 17-fold-symmetric periplasmic scaffold in pink as depicted in Figs. 2a, 3a, 4a, and 6. (d) Innermost basal disk ring of 51 FlgP as depicted in Fig. 2. (e4) Innermost basal disk ring of 51 FlgP and innermost medial disk ring of 17 PflC1 as depicted in Fig. 3c. (f) Innermost basal disk ring of 51 FlgP and medial disk lattice of 17 PflC1–7 as depicted in Fig. 3d, f. (g) Proximal disk of 17 PflAB FliL4 as depicted in Fig. 4b, c.

(a) Map-model FSC curves for protein models refined into the scaffold map: FlgP, PflA, PflC1, and PflC2–7 calculated in Phenix83, alongside images of excised pieces of the density map corresponding to individual proteins. High and low isosurface thresholds are denoted by solid and mesh surfaces, respectively, to illustrate fit of models into secondary structure densities. (b) Cross-correlation per residue plots of proteins docked into the map: PflB, FliL, MotB, PflD, calculated using Phenix. Mean CC values are shown with dashed line and in text inset.

(a) AlphaFold2 (ref. 29) prediction of FlgP (dark grey) required bending of the oligomer to fit the curvature of the first ring of the basal disk (purple). (b) AlphaFold2 prediction of PflC1 required independent rigid-body docking of the N- and C-terminal domains (magenta). (c) The resulting N-terminal domain of PflC was rigid-body docked into density multiple times for PflC2–7. C-terminal domains were not modelled. Higher thresholds required for more peripheral, and presumably more flexible, components. (d) PflA and PflB AlphaFold2 models (dark grey) required bending to fit into density maps (pale and dark green for PflA and PflB, respectively).

(a) Kernel density estimation bead position plots over many rotations for 11 cells. Measurements were of duration 20 to 240 s, substantially de-energized by CCCP to slow rotation. Their (x,y) histograms, a kernel density of the angular position, and the weighted power spectrum are depicted. The top left is the trace shown in Fig. 2. (b) Weighted power spectrum of all 11 traces.

(a) Size Exclusion Chromatography of PflC (red) along with protein standards (grey) showing elution volume. (b) Calibration graph showing a dimer of PflC (red) corresponding to retention times during elution. (c) Mass photometry measurements of purified PflC (replicates). (d) Size Exclusion Chromatography of PflCN (∆236–349, green) along with protein standards (grey) showing elution volume. (e) Calibration graph of PflCN (green) corresponding to retention times during elution. (f) Mass photometry measurements of purified PflCN. Theoretical masses are shown in the inserts. The instrument's limit of detection is 35 kDA, meaning the monomer mass is larger than expected.

(a) Needleman-Wunsch global sequence alignments of Campylobacter jejuni PflCN and PflCC with C. jejuni HtrA from ChimeraX MatchMaker91 using default parameters. Asterisks highlight HtrA His-Asp-Ser catalytic triad not conserved in PflC. Coloured boxes indicate pruned residue pairs between PflCN:HtrAN (red) and PflCC:HtrAC (green) from MatchMaker algorithm using a 4 Å RMSD cutoff (b) Core folds of PflC and HtrA from ChimeraX structural alignment using pruned residue pairs of PflCN and PflCN (left) to HtrA (right) (PDBID: 6Z0536) guided by the global alignment in panel A. Pruned core residues are depicted in colour, while non-core residues are depicted in grey. (c) RMSD of PflC alignment to HtrA depicted on the structure of PflC as worm diameter and colour (blue: 0 Å, white: 4 Å, red: 8 Å). (d) Left panel shows PflC and HtrA oriented as with the PflC protomer in Fig. 3c Right panels depict PflC and HtrA rotated similarly to reveal the HtrA active site cleft. Close-up boxes include stick representation of residues, highlighting HtrA's H119:D150:S224 catalytic triad, and PflC's N65 and S122 residues that sequence align to D150 and S224, revealing divergence and atrophy of the active site region in PflC.

(a) Automated secondary structure annotation of HtrA using the ChimeraX implementation of the Defining the Secondary Structure of Proteins algorithm (top); and PflC (bottom) with HtrA nomenclature transferred based on structural correspondence. (b) Topology diagram of HtrA and PflC generated using PDBsum92. Note that due to algorithmic nuances, PDBsum's secondary structure definitions do not exactly correspond to those of DSSP. Locations of the three catalytic triad residues H119, D150 and S224 are labelled.

(a–d) Mass photometry measurements of purified PflA and PflB constructs show the proteins are mainly monodisperse. There is a dimer peak present for the PflAΔCter construct, likely due to a reduction in stability and solubility. (e–g) Mass photometry measurements of mixtures of PflB and PflA variants. Dimer peaks appear only when β-sandwich and linker domain of PflA is present. In panels E and G, monomer peaks of PflA and PflB are not resolved due to their similar molecular weights. In the bottom panel, the 54 kDa peak corresponds to PflAΔCter, and the 79 kDa peak to PflB. Broadly, monomer peaks have a yellow background, dimer peaks red.

Ageing is a complex biological process whose underlying mechanisms remain contentious. Nonetheless, due to an ageing global population and the rising incidence of age-related diseases, understanding why we age is one of the most important scientific questions of our time, with profound medical implications. Here, I explore the fundamental nature of the ageing process and provide an overview of modern mechanistic theories. I critically examine two main groups of ageing theories: error-based and program-based theories. I discuss the relevance of these theories in the context of ageing patterns, genetic manipulations and longevity drugs, highlighting how experimental challenges and technological limitations have hindered progress. Overall, there is a pressing and unmet need for a robust theoretical framework in ageing research. Elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of ageing would be crucial for developing effective interventions that slow the ageing process and prevent its associated diseases.

Last year, internet infrastructure firm Cloudflare launched tools enabling its customers to block AI scrapers. Today the company has taken its fight against permissionless scraping several steps further. It has switched to blocking AI crawlers by default for its customers and is moving forward with a Pay Per Crawl program that lets customers charge AI companies to scrape their websites.

Web crawlers have trawled the internet for information for decades. Without them, people would lose vitally important online tools, from Google Search to the Internet Archive's invaluable digital preservation work. But the AI boom has produced a corresponding boomlet in AI-focused web crawlers, and these bots scrape web pages with a frequency that can mimic a DDoS attack, straining servers and knocking websites offline. Even when websites can handle the heightened activity, many do not want AI crawlers scraping their content, especially news publications that are demanding AI companies to pay to use their work. “We've been feverishly trying to protect ourselves,” says Danielle Coffey, the president and CEO of the trade group News Media Alliance, which represents several thousand North American outlets.

So far, Cloudflare's head of AI control, privacy, and media products, Will Allen, tells WIRED, over 1 million customer websites have activated its older AI-bot-blocking tools. Now millions more will have the option of keeping bot blocking as their default. Cloudflare also says it can identify even “shadow” scrapers that are not publicized by AI companies. The company noted that it uses a proprietary combination of behavioral analysis, fingerprinting, and machine learning to classify and separate AI bots from “good” bots.

A widely used web standard called the Robots Exclusion Protocol, often implemented through a robots.txt file, helps publishers block bots on a case-by-case basis, but following it is not legally required, and there's plenty of evidence that some AI companies try to evade efforts to block their scrapers. “Robots.txt is ignored,” Coffey says. According to a report from the content licensing platform Tollbit, which offers its own marketplace for publishers to negotiate with AI companies over bot access, AI scraping is still on the rise—including scraping that ignores robots.txt. Tollbit found that over 26 million scrapes ignored the protocol in March 2025 alone.

In this context, Cloudflare's shift to blocking by default could prove a significant roadblock to surreptitious scrapers and could give publishers more leverage to negotiate, whether through the Pay Per Crawl program or otherwise. “This could dramatically change the power dynamic. Up to this point, AI companies have not needed to pay to license content, because they've known that they can just take it without consequences,” says Atlantic CEO (and former WIRED editor in chief) Nicholas Thompson. “Now they'll have to negotiate, and it will become a competitive advantage for the AI companies that can strike more and better deals with more and better publishers.”

AI startup ProRata, which operates the AI search engine Gist.AI, has agreed to participate in the Pay Per Crawl program, according to CEO and founder Bill Gross. “We firmly believe that all content creators and publishers should be compensated when their content is used in AI answers,” Gross says.

Of course, it remains to be seen whether the big players in the AI space will participate in a program like Pay Per Crawl, which is in beta. (Cloudflare declined to name current participants.) Companies like OpenAI have struck licensing deals with a variety of publishing partners, including WIRED parent company Condé Nast, but specific details of these agreements have not been disclosed, including whether the agreement covers bot access.

Meanwhile, there's an entire online ecosystem of tutorials about how to evade Cloudflare's bot blocking tools aimed at web scrapers. As the blocking default rolls out, it's likely these efforts will continue. Cloudflare emphasizes that customers who do want to let the robots scrape unimpeded will be able to turn off the blocking setting. “All blocking is fully optional and at the discretion of each individual user,” Allen says.

Whether you're posting on Reddit, Discord, or Github, there's only one way to add formatting: Markdown. If you want to add a link, bold some text, or even split text into paragraphs, you will need to know the basics of this text-based formatting system.

Does that sound scary? Trust me, it's not. Markdown has just a few rules for formatting text the way you want, and you only need to learn the rules for the formatting you actually use.

Let's go over the simple rules, talk about why Markdown is useful, then take a look at a few resources you can use to go further with Markdown.

Markdown is a way to apply rich formatting to plaintext by adding certain characters to it. On platforms like Discord or Reddit, where messages are short and relatively simple, you really only need to learn a few basics:

The above five tips are more than enough for things like Reddit and Discord. Even though you're typing what looks like code, when your post is published, all you'll see is the rich-text formatting, complete with links and images.

If you're using Markdown to write entire documents, though, you're going to need a few document-specific tools. Here are the key ones:

That covers most of what you need to know in order to write a document in Markdown. If you're confused about how this formatting will look, it helps to play around and see the results. A great website to do this on is MarkdownLivePreview.com. The left panel shows the Markdown while the right side shows how that will look. Try different things there for a bit and you'll feel a lot more comfortable.

This all might have you asking: Why are sites forcing people to learn a slightly esoteric way to format text? And the answer is that this system, even if a little bit confusing at first, is very straightforward and clear once you get used to it.

Most people get used to writing on a computer using tools like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. There are both word processors, meaning they are built to represent a printed page on your screen. They also both are called “what you see is what you get” editors—or WYSIWYG editors—meaning that the formatting is shown on the screen directly. If you bold some text, you see it as bold on the screen; if you add a link, you see the linked text get underlined and turn blue like it would on a web page. There is no way to tell, by looking at the text itself, where bolding begins and ends or what the destination of the link is.

This might seem intuitive, and to be fair there is a simplicity to it. But that simplicity is made possible by code that the user does not see, and the fact that the code is kept behind the scenes can be confusing in some ways. Anyone who has tried to add a few words to the end of a link, or right after a link, knows that this ambiguity can be frustrating—you'll end up either accidentally making the link longer than you intended, or doing the opposite and adding text that's not linked. This doesn't happen while writing in Markdown because you can clearly see where all the formatting begins and ends.

Markdown files are also future-proof. Because all of the text formatting, linking, and document structure schema is written in plaintext, a format that hasn't changed in decades and isn't owned by any one company, you can be reasonably certain that anyone who finds a Markdown file in 50 years is going to be able to make sense of it. The same can't be said about Microsoft Office files.

And, finally, there's speed. I personally find writing in Markdown a lot faster. I've used it for thousands of articles published online at many publications, including the one you're reading now. As I write, I appreciate that I can do all of my formatting without using menus and toolbars, and without even moving my fingers from the keyboard. As an editor, I appreciate knowing exactly where formatting begins and ends.

You can argue whether this is worth the trade-offs of the more familiar WYSIWYG editor, and many people have. But for many, myself included, Markdown is simpler to use while writing for the web.

This article is intended as an introduction to Markdown, not a full guide. If you want to learn more, I highly recommend checking out MarkdownGuide.org, a website that takes the time to walk you through how Markdown works and why you might want to use it.

The real fun, though, comes when you start playing with Markdown editors. I mentioned MarkdownLivePreview.com, and that's a great starting point. There are also excellent editors for your computer. Typora is a very nice $15 application that lets you type in Markdown and see the formatting in real time. The very popular (and free) note-taking application Obsidian, which I personally use for writing and productivity, works the same way but with a lot more bells and whistles. Or, if you want something simple for editing single files, Markedit is quite good on the Mac, and MarkDownPad works well on Windows.

Learning Markdown is a bit of work up front, granted, but it can really speed up writing once you get used to it—and the right tools make it easier.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Senator Blackburn Pulls Support for AI Moratorium in Trump's ‘Big Beautiful Bill' Amid Backlash","https://www.wired.com/story/ai-moratorium-trump-megabill-blackburn/","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 01:18:00 GMT","

As Congress races to pass President Donald Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill,” it's also sprinting to placate the many haters of the bill's “AI moratorium” provision which originally required a 10-year pause on state AI regulations.

The provision, which was championed by White House AI czar and venture capitalist David Sacks, has proved remarkably unpopular with a diverse contingent of government officials, ranging from 40 state attorneys general to the ultra-MAGA representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Sunday night, Senator Marsha Blackburn and Senator Ted Cruz announced a new version of the AI moratorium, knocking the pause from a full decade down to five years and adding a variety of carve-outs. But after critics attacked the watered-down version of the bill as a “get-out-of-jail-free card” for Big Tech, Blackburn reversed course Monday evening.

“While I appreciate Chairman Cruz's efforts to find acceptable language that allows states to protect their citizens from the abuses of AI, the current language is not acceptable to those who need these protections the most,” Blackburn said in a statement to WIRED. “This provision could allow Big Tech to continue to exploit kids, creators, and conservatives. Until Congress passes federally preemptive legislation like the Kids Online Safety Act and an online privacy framework, we can't block states from making laws that protect their citizens.”

For those keeping track at home, Blackburn initially opposed the moratorium, then worked with Cruz on the five-year version of the provision, then changed her mind again to oppose her own compromised version of the law.

She has historically championed regulations that protect the music industry, which is a major economic player in her home state of Tennessee. Last year, Tennessee passed a law to stop AI deepfakes of music artists. Her proposed AI provision included an exemption for this kind of law, which expands the legal right to protect one's likeness from commercial exploitation. The version of the moratorium she and Cruz proposed on Sunday also had carve-outs for state laws dealing with “unfair or deceptive acts or practices, child online safety, child sexual abuse material, rights of publicity, protection of a person's name, image, voice, or likeness.”

Despite these carve-outs, the new AI provision received fierce opposition from a wide array of organizations and individuals, ranging from the International Longshore & Warehouse Union (“dangerous federal overreach”) to Steve Bannon (“they'll get all their dirty work done in the first five years.”)

The moratorium's carve-out language comes with a caveat that the exempted state laws cannot place “undue or disproportionate burden” on AI systems or “automated decision systems.” With AI and algorithmic feeds embedded in social platforms, critics like Senator Maria Cantwell see the provision's language as creating “a brand-new shield against litigation and state regulation.”

Many advocacy groups and legal experts who focus on these issues, including kid safety rules, say that the new AI provision remains incredibly damaging. Danny Weiss, the chief advocacy officer at the nonprofit Common Sense Media, says that this version is still “extremely sweeping” and “could affect almost every effort to regulate tech with regards to safety” because of the undue burden shield.

J.B. Branch, an advocate for consumer rights nonprofit Public Citizen, called the updated moratorium “a clever Trojan horse designed to wipe out state protections while pretending to preserve them” in a statement, and argued that the undue burden language rendered the carve-outs “meaningless.”

On Monday, Cantwell and Senator Ed Markey introduced an amendment to remove the AI moratorium from the bill altogether, condemning the version proposed Sunday evening as “a wolf in sheep's clothing,” according to a statement from Markey. “The language still allows the Trump administration to use federal broadband funding as a weapon against the states and still prevents states from protecting children online from Big Tech's predatory behavior,” he said. (The moratorium ties access to funding from the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment program to compliance with the five-year pause.)

In another twist, on Monday night, Cantwell and Blackburn introduced their own amendment to strip the AI moratorium from the bill. “Blackburn is now co-sponsoring Senator Cantwell's amendment, and Cantwell agreed to cosponsor Blackburn's new amendment,” said Tricia Enright, communications director for the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, in an email to WIRED

The Trump Administration has urged Congress to vote on the Big Beautiful Bill before the break for the Fourth of July holiday.

Update 6/30/25 9:39 pm ET: This story has been updated to include information about the new amendment Cantwell and Blackburn introduced Monday night.

Another week, another Chinese electric car poised to deliver an extinction event to Western automakers.

This time it's Xiaomi, a Beijing-based tech firm best known for smartphones and the company behind the Porsche Taycan–baiting SU7, which in late-2024 was so popular that Xiaomi increased its sales forecast three times in a matter of months.

Now Xiaomi is back, and this time it has an electric SUV up its sleeve. Resembling the love child of a Ferrari Purosangue and an Aston Martin DBX707 described down a patchy phone line, the YU7 hits all of the benchmarks you'd expect from an EV in 2025.

The $35,000 YU7 has top specs for low money: 0-62 mph in 5.88 seconds and 800-volt electric architecture.

There are three models, ranging from the YU7 Standard, a single-motor car with 235 kW and a 0-62 mph time of 5.88 seconds, through the more potent, dual-motor YU7 Pro and, leaning into smartphone nomenclature, headed by the YU7 Max. That model has 508 kW of power—38 more than the electric Porsche Macan Turbo—and a supercar-like 0-62 mph time of 3.23 seconds.

Using China's somewhat generous CLTC test cycle, range claims span from 472 miles for the Max to a whopping 518 miles from the less powerful Standard. Xiaomi claims the car's 800-volt electric architecture delivers a 10 to 80 percent charge time of just 12 minutes, or can add 385 miles of range in 15 minutes.

All very impressive, but especially so when you consider the Chinese market price. The YU7 starts at 253,500 yuan, which is about $35,000 in the US—the exact price Tesla briefly achieved with its first-generation Model 3 in early-2019, before heading back up to the $40,000 mark. The Pro and Max versions of the Xiaomi YU7 are priced at 279,900 yuan ($39,000) and 329,900 yuan ($46,000) respectively, while Tesla's Model Y starts at 263,500 yuan ($36,500).

Meanwhile, Tesla has just missed its own deadline for putting more affordable cars into production. Despite canning its so-called Model 2, the company said at the start of 2025: “Plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.” We're into July now and still waiting.

A tech-laden interior includes a windscreen-wide HyperVision panoramic display, plus Xiaomi's ecosystem also allows for its Pad 7S Pro tablet to be attached to the rear of the front seats.

Small wonder that increasingly patriotic Chinese car buyers descended on Xiaomi's website in huge numbers when the YU7 went on sale last week. The company claimed 200,000 preorders in the first three minutes and 289,000 within an hour of the order books opening. If all those $700 paid preorders turn into actual sales, that's more than what the entire UK car industry produces in four months. It also smashes the 90,000 preorders Xiaomi's SU7, its first EV, earned in its initial 24 hours last year.

But, as Elon Musk will tell you, preorders are one thing and deliveries can be quite another.

Should we take the huge YU7 preorder figures with a pinch of salt? You can if you like, but Xiaomi already has impressive form here, having delivered more than 250,000 examples of its SU7 saloon since an almost equal number of preorders arrived just a year earlier. The company said in March how it expects to deliver 350,000 vehicles this year, suggesting the new YU7 could add at least 100,000 sales to what Xiaomi is already managing with the SU7. In response to the YU7 orders, Xiaomi's share price has soared.

The new Chinese SUV is priced to directly take on the recently refreshed Tesla Model Y.

Compare this to the Cybertruck, which pulled in a claimed 146,000 reservations in its first 36 hours, back in 2019. This soon passed 250,000, and Musk went on to claim that “over one million” orders had been placed between the 2019 unveiling and when production finally began some five years later. But, according to data associated with a March recall issued because Tesla used the wrong glue on its stainless steel body panels, fewer than 50,000 Cybertrucks appeared to have been sold in 14 months.

One million preorders and 46,000 sales doesn't sound great, but is roughly in line with the 2 to 16 percent conversion rate the automotive industry aims for. While that doesn't say much about the Cybertruck's sales performance, it further underscores the phenomenal early success of Xiaomi's auto business. The world's third-largest smartphone company only started making cars 18 months ago, and so far offers just two models, in the SU7 and newer YU7, yet is already braced for enormous growth, both at home and overseas.

As well as reporting a near-50 percent jump in fourth-quarter revenue, Xiaomi said in March 2025 that it plans to open 10,000 of its Mi Home stores in foreign markets over the next five years, almost doubling the number of stores it already operates in China.

These brick-and-mortar shops stock everything from Xiaomi's smartphones and tablets, to wearables, smart-home devices, televisions, computers, home appliances, luggage and, yes, electric cars. Although tariffs mean US expansion remains on ice, Xiaomi president Lu Weibing said there is great potential for Xiaomi's products overseas, and that it aims to start shipping cars abroad in 2027.

Little else is known about Xiaomi's plans to follow in the tire tracks of BYD, Nio, and other Chinese car brands that have expanded to Europe and elsewhere. Xiaomi's last shot across the bow of Western automakers came in late June, when it was announced that a modified version of its SU7 Ultra had become the third-fastest car to ever lap the Nürburgring Nordschleife.

Wearing slick tires and reinforced with a motorsport-spec roll cage, the car topped 210 mph and completed the course in 6 minutes, 22.091 seconds, lowering its previous best time by 24 seconds and slotting in behind only the Porsche 919 Evo and Volkswagen ID.R on the track's overall leaderboard.

The YU7's front seats have one-touch reclining and 10-point massage, while rear seats can also go back to a 135-degree “lounge position.”

Such a feat may be of less interest to Chinese buyers who are, rightly, more concerned with smartphone connectivity. But to a European audience accustomed to seeing performance brands like Mercedes-AMG and Porsche tout Nurburgring times in the same breath as wheel size and truck capacity, it's a big deal.

As for the new YU7, just like the SU7 before it, Xiaomi seeks to pack in a lot of bang for its buyers' buck. Every model gets double-laminated glass and what the company describes as industry-leading airtightness that's claimed to reduce outside noise to a level “surpassing even million-[yuan] level luxury models.”

As with any new Chinese car, connectivity is king. Xiaomi's operating system, called HyperOS, gives its cars a smartphone-like user interface but also lets passengers access controls for other Xiaomi products, like robotic vacuum cleaners, air purifiers, door locks, and home security cameras.

User profiles and associated content like music playlists are synced in the cloud across multiple Xiaomi devices, including cars, phones, and computers. Fully invest in the Xiaomi ecosystem, and a meeting added to your phone calendar will supposedly trigger the car to pre-condition its cabin ahead of your drive and tell the robotic vacuum to clean up while you're out. Xiaomi's ecosystem also allows for its Pad 7S Pro tablet to be attached to the rear of the front seats.

Another dose of innovation comes from Xiaomi's “Human X Car X Home” ecosystem, which uses nine magnetic powered mounting points for installing action cameras and wireless phone chargers in the YU7. They can also be used for adding accessories such as tissue boxes, glasses cases and physical buttons for controlling the infotainment system—the latter being Xiaomi's ingenious answer for drivers who prefer tactile switchgear to touchscreens.

The company even offers a 4K camera, attached to a gimbal, which mounts to the rearview mirror and can be used for on-the-go video calls or for checking on pets left in the car.

The YU7 Max has 508 kW of power—38 more than the electric Porsche Macan Turbo—and a supercar-like 0-62 mph time of 3.23 seconds.

Xiaomi would rather drivers use one of its phones, but iPhone users aren't left out in the cold. Remote unlocking over UWB (ultrawide band) is supported, along with iOS Control Center shortcuts and an option to use the iPhone's Action Button as a remote lock/unlock switch.

CarPlay is here too—unlike in any Tesla—but instead of taking over the entire display, it can be pinned as a desktop widget, leaving space on the rest of the 16.1-in touchscreen for the car's own apps. Apple Music is baked into Xiaomi's own OS, and there's also an Apple Watch app.

Xiaomi's driver-assistance tech looks impressive on paper, too, with lidar, an Nvidia Drive AGX Thor chip with 700 TOPS (trillion operations per second) computing power, millimeter-wave radar, 11 HD cameras, and 12 ultrasonic sensors. But, although it too uses the “autopilot” name,  Xiaomi stops short of calling its cars autonomous—and, after a fatal SU7 crash earlier this year, in which the ADAS system was reportedly enabled, its approach to self-driving is more cautious than Tesla's.

When he revealed the second-generation Tesla Roadster, all the way back in 2017, Elon Musk described its significance as “a hardcore smackdown” to the rest of the industry. Eight years later, with the Roadster little more than vaporware, Cybertruck sales falling well short of initial demand, and more affordable cars still nowhere in sight, it's Xiaomi that's landed the haymaker.

More than a decade after the acclaimed Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, DK is returning with Donkey Kong Bananza to add some much-needed variety to the Switch 2 lineup.

The Switch 2 is the fastest-selling console in Nintendo's history; days after release, it had already sold more than 3.5 million units across the world. Its initial launch lineup—though filled out with third-party games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Yakuza 0 Director's Cut—has been light on Nintendo first-party games, relying heavily on Mario Kart World to sell console bundles.

Although the Switch 2's backward compatibility means the majority of its Switch library is easily accessible, the Switch 2 doesn't have much in the way of exclusive games. It essentially exists as a hardware upgrade, rather than a must-own in order to play a new generation of titles. Donkey Kong Bananza, launching July 17, is the console's next heavy hitter: an action-adventure game starring the tie-wearing gorilla, made by the developers behind Super Mario Odyssey in 2017. The game signals a welcome shift in Switch 2's lineup, moving from competition with friends into more classic exploration and puzzle solving.

Odyssey's DNA is all over Bananza's colorful, expansive world. Donkey Kong is on the hunt for giant, golden bananas as he makes his way to the planet's core with the help of a young singer named Pauline. (An adult version of Pauline is also present in Super Mario Odyssey.) During a demo event held in New York, WIRED spent some hands-on time with the game, including exploring different environments in its subterranean layers and the game's co-op mode.

Much of Bananza is about smashing things. The environments are highly destructible, from top to bottom, and it's therapeutic to spend your time windmilling DK's hammy arms through the floor itself. The more you destroy, the more likely you are to find treasure or more areas to explore, so it's worth treating the game's world like a rage room. The demo we played included some light puzzles, most of which involved pulling out chunks of explosive materials to break open new paths or kill enemies—straightforward, but still satisfying.

Donkey Kong's sidekick Pauline is an important part of his adventure, both in story and practice. Her singing powers can temporarily transform DK into other animals, like an ostrich that grants you the ability to glide through the air. The game has a light leveling system that you can sink points into to expand DK's powers, including his animal abilities. Pauline, too, is playable, albeit in a different way. She's constantly glued to DK's back, and she attacks by absorbing elements around her and shooting them back out in word-shaped attacks.

Pauline, on top of playing a smaller role in co-op, is also trickier to control. Where DK can be maneuvered at the player's discretion, Pauline is at the mercy of where it is DK wants to go. During a boss fight, this proved especially tricky. While my DK-playing partner ran around, I tried to charge up attacks and fire them off fast enough to land a hit. Our demo focused on the console's mouse controls, which made the whole experience feel far more frantic than focused for me as someone who prefers to use a controller.

Donkey Kong Bananza is goofy, easily digestible, and enjoyable to spend time with. The game's world is beautiful and fun to destroy, while the true depths of it seem impressive. Although Nintendo's lack of first-party games that would make the console a must-own so far doesn't seem to have hurt its sales, industry analyst Mat Piscatella tells WIRED that a new console's real test is about the months after launch, especially around the first holiday season. “Donkey Kong Bananza should certainly help over the summer months, when the available supply of Switch 2 hardware should finally catch up to demand,” he says. “But the big question is what's coming for the holiday window.”

Piscatella points to games such as Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, the long-awaited follow-up to Metroid Prime 3: Corruption that's expected to launch this year after years of troubled development, but still has no release date. “It would likely be helpful if a few more big releases were announced for the holiday period to continue the launch momentum,” he says. “It's tough to find too many nits to pick on a system that just set a new all-time launch sales record.”

Donkey Kong Bananza, the DK-centric game since 2014, feels like the type of action-adventure game the Switch 2 is so desperately missing; not exactly a Mario title, but close enough.

Grammarly announced Tuesday the acquisition of email client Superhuman in a push to build out its AI for its productivity suite. Neither companies provided details about the financial terms of the deal.

Superhuman was founded by Rahul Vohra, Vivek Sodera, and Conrad Irwin. The company raised more than $114 million in funding from backers including a16z, IVP, and Tiger Global, with its last valuation at $825 million, according to data from venture data analytics firm Traxcn.

“With Superhuman, we can deliver that future to millions more professionals while giving our existing users another surface for agent collaboration that simply doesn't exist anywhere else. Email isn't just another app; it's where professionals spend significant portions of their day, and it's the perfect staging ground for orchestrating multiple AI agents simultaneously,” Shishir Malhotra, CEO of Grammarly, said in a statement. 

With this deal, CEO Vohra and other Superhuman employees are moving over to Grammarly.

“Email is the main communication tool for billions of people worldwide and the number-one use case for Grammarly customers. By joining forces with Grammarly, we will invest even more in the core Superhuman experience, as well as create a new way of working where AI agents collaborate across the communication tools that we all use every day,” Rahul Vohra, CEO of Superhuman, said in a statement. 

In the last few months, Superhuman has released AI-powered features related to scheduling, replies, and categorization. In its announcement, Grammarly said that it wants to build AI agents for emails using Superhuman's tech. The company said that email remains one of the top use cases for Grammarly.

Last year, Grammarly acquired collaborative productivity software Coda, and as part of the deal, promoted Coda's co-founder, Shishir Malhotra, to CEO. 

In May, Grammarly raised $1 billion from General Catalyst in a non-dilutive investment. Rather than giving up equity, the company will pay back General Catalyst the money with a capped percentage of revenue it creates using the venture firm's money.

U.S. senators voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to remove a controversial 10-year ban on states' abilities to regulate AI from the Trump administration's “Big Beautiful Bill,” reports Axios.

The provision to the reconciliation bill was introduced by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX). Many prominent Silicon Valley executives — including OpenAI's Sam Altman, Anduril's Palmer Luckey, and a16z's Marc Andreessen — were in favor of the so-called “AI moratorium,” which they said would prevent states from forming an unworkable patchwork of regulation that could stifle AI innovation.

Opposition to the provision became a bipartisan issue, as most Democrats and many Republicans warned that the ban on state regulation would harm consumers, and let powerful AI companies operate with little oversight. Critics also objected to Cruz's plan to tie compliance with federal broadband funding.

After going back and forth over the provision, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) on Monday offered an amendment to strip the provision alongside Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA). 

Blackburn (pictured above) originally opposed the provision, but came to an agreement with Cruz over the weekend that shortened the proposed ban from 10 years to five. Blackburn then pulled her support for the provision entirely on Monday.

The Senate voted 99-1 to strip the AI moratorium.

WhatsApp is adding more AI features to its business suite. The company on Tuesday announced it's introducing the ability for large businesses to reach customers through voice calls, which will allow the app to explore the use of AI-powered voice agents. 

The company is also looking into using AI to recommend products to users.

WhatsApp Business, which has over 200 million monthly users, has been a notable revenue driver for Meta, as its executives noted in the last few quarterly earnings calls. The company earns money through its click-to-WhatsApp ads and charges merchants for messaging features on the platform. 

While the company doesn't charge for its AI features at the moment, there is a possibility that it could put a price tag on that after it achieves scale.  

Today, small business accounts can already chat with customers over voice on WhatsApp, but larger business accounts haven't yet had the ability. In the next few weeks, larger businesses will be able to access this feature via the API. This will allow customers to place voice calls to businesses and allow businesses to call back customers. (The latter wasn't available during earlier tests last year, but is now.)

WhatsApp said it will soon add a way for customers to send and receive voice messages from businesses, too.

By enabling voice pipelines, companies could set up an AI-enabled voice agent through a startup like Vapi, ElevenLabs, Coval, or Phonic to run their customer service over WhatsApp.

In addition, an AI-powered chat-based customer support and outreach feature that began testing last year is now being expanded to more merchants in Mexico.

In addition, WhatsApp is looking to AI to power product recommendations on a merchant's site. 

Today, there are multiple venture-backed startups that are using AI to fuel personalized product suggestions for sellers. Similarly, Meta said after an initial recommendation or conversation, its AI could answer follow-up questions or provide updates via WhatsApp.

The updates are rolling out starting today to business customers with the general release and will reach the wider user base over the coming weeks.

Genesis AI, a startup that aims to build a foundational model for powering all kinds of robots, has emerged from stealth with a giant $105 million seed round co-led by Eclipse Ventures and Khosla Ventures.

Founded last December by Zhou Xian (pictured above, left), who holds a PhD in robotics from Carnegie Mellon University, and Théophile Gervet (pictured above, right), a former research scientist with the French AI lab Mistral, the startup wants to build a general-purpose model that will enable robots to automate a wide range of repetitive tasks, from lab work to housekeeping.

Large language models are trained on vast datasets of text, but AI models for robotics must be trained on data on the physical world. However, acquiring that real-world data makes for a costly and time-consuming endeavor. 

To overcome that, Genesis is turning to synthetic data, which it generates using a proprietary physics engine that, it says, is capable of accurately modeling the physical world.

Genesis' synthetic data engine originated from an academic project that Xian led in collaboration with researchers from 18 universities. Several participants from that project have since joined Genesis, making up its current staff of over 20 researchers who specialize in robotics, machine learning, and graphics.

Genesis claims its proprietary simulation engine allows it to develop models faster, a distinct advantage over competitors who rely on Nvidia's software.

Other companies working on developing general-purpose AI models for robots include Physical Intelligence, which raised a $400 million round, and Skild AI, which was valued at $4 billion earlier this year.

“It's a big unknown: Will anybody have a large robotics foundation model that will generalize across tasks? That's a bet we want to go after,” Kanu Gulati, a partner at Khosla Ventures, told TechCrunch. 

“Of all the teams we have seen, we like [Genesis'] approach for going after robotics foundation models,” she added.

Genesis is developing its synthetic data and building the foundational model across two offices, in Silicon Valley and Paris.

As the next milestone, Genesis plans to release its model to the robotics community by the end of the year.

Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, has raised $10 billion in debt and equity, Morgan Stanley confirmed on Monday.

In a post on X, the financial giant said xAI had raised $5 billion in debt and another $5 billion in a separate strategic equity transaction.

“The combination of debt and equity reduces the overall cost of capital and substantially expands pools of capital available to xAI. The proceeds will support xAI's continued development of cutting-edge AI solutions, including one of the world's largest data center [sic] and its flagship Grok platform,” Morgan Stanley wrote. 

xAI did not immediately return a request for comment outside regular business hours. 

This latest funding follows a $6 billion round that the company raised in December from a slate of big-name investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Blackrock, Fidelity, Lightspeed, MGX, Morgan Stanley, OIA, QIA, Sequoia Capital, Valor Equity Partners, Vy Capital, Nvidia, AMD, and Kingdom Holdings, a Saudi conglomerate.

The new equity round brings xAI's total capital raised to about $17 billion.

Cloudflare, a cloud infrastructure provider that serves 20% of the web, announced Tuesday the launch of a new marketplace that reimagines the relationship between website owners and AI companies — ideally giving publishers greater control over their content.

For the last year, Cloudflare has launched tools for publishers to address the rampant rise of AI crawlers, including a one-click solution to block all AI bots, as well as a dashboard to view how AI crawlers are visiting their site. In a 2024 interview, Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince told TechCrunch these products were laying a foundation for a new type of marketplace in which publishers could distribute their content to AI companies and be compensated for it.

Now, Cloudflare is bringing that marketplace to life.

It's called Pay per Crawl, and Cloudflare is launching the “experiment” in private beta on Tuesday. Website owners in the experiment can choose to let AI crawlers, on an individual basis, scrape their site at a set rate — a micropayment for every single “crawl.” Alternatively, website owners can choose to let AI crawlers scrape their site for free, or block them altogether. Cloudflare claims its tools will let website owners see whether crawlers are scraping their site for AI training data, to appear in AI search responses, or for other purposes.

At scale, Cloudflare's marketplace is a big idea that could offer publishers a potential business model for the AI era — and it also places Cloudflare at the center of it all. The launch of the marketplace comes at a time when news publishers are facing existential questions about how to reach readers, as Google Search traffic fades away and AI chatbots rise in popularity.

There's not a clear answer for how news publishers will survive in the AI era. Some, such as The New York Times, have filed lawsuits against tech companies for training their AI models on news articles without permission. Meanwhile, other publishers have struck multi-year deals to license their content for AI model training and to have their content appear in AI chatbot responses.

Even so, only large publishers have struck AI licensing deals, and it's still unclear whether they provide meaningful sources of revenue. Cloudflare aims to create a more durable system where publishers can set prices on their own terms.

The company also announced Tuesday that new websites set up with Cloudflare will now, by default, block all AI crawlers. Site owners will have to grant certain AI crawlers permission to access their site — a change Cloudflare says will give every new domain “the default of control.”

Several large publishers, including Conde Nast, TIME, The Associated Press, The Atlantic, ADWEEK, and Fortune, have signed on with Cloudflare to block AI crawlers by default in support of the company's broader goal of a “permission-based approach to crawling.” 

The business model that many of these publishers relied on for decades is slowly becoming unreliable. Historically, online publishers have allowed Google to scrape their sites in return for referrals in Google Search, which translated to traffic to their sites, and ultimately, ad revenue. 

However, new data from Cloudflare suggests that publishers may be getting a worse deal in the AI era than in the Google Search era. While some websites cite ChatGPT as a major traffic source, that doesn't appear to be the case broadly.

This June, Cloudflare says it found that Google's crawler scraped its websites 14 times for every referral it gave them. Meanwhile, OpenAI's crawler scraped websites 17,000 times for every one referral, while Anthropic scraped websites 73,000 times for every referral.

Meanwhile, OpenAI and Google are building AI agents that are designed to visit websites on behalf of users, collect information, and deliver it back to users directly. A future in which these tools are mainstream has huge implications for publishers that rely on readers visiting their sites.

Cloudflare notes that the “true potential” of  Pay per Crawl may emerge in an “agentic” future.

“What if an agentic paywall could operate at the network edge, entirely programmatically? Imagine asking your favorite deep research program to help you synthesize the latest cancer research or a legal brief, or just help you find the best restaurant in Soho — and then giving that agent a budget to spend to acquire the best and most relevant content,” Cloudflare said in a blog post.

To participate in Cloudflare's experimental marketplace, AI companies and publishers must both be set up with Cloudflare accounts. In their accounts, both parties can set rates at which they'd like to buy and sell a “crawl” of the publisher's content. Cloudflare acts as the intermediary in these transactions, charging the AI company and distributing the earnings to the publisher.

Cloudflare spokesperson Ripley Park tells TechCrunch there are no stablecoins or cryptocurrency involved in Pay per Crawl at this time, even though many have suggested digital currency would be perfect for something like this.

Cloudflare's marketplace feels like a bold vision for the future that requires a lot of publishers and AI companies to get on board. Still, there's no guarantee publishers will get a good deal, and convincing AI firms to participate could be tough, given they're currently scraping content for free.

Nevertheless, Cloudflare seems like one of the few companies in a position to make a marketplace like this happen.

The inbox->outbox flow turns into the way to clear the inbox. It's not about better communication, it's about speedrunning their way to inbox zero.The worst case was a person who would respond to everything with a one-sentence question, then respond to the response with another one-sentence question, and repeat all day long. He could turn a brief e-mail into a thread with 15 one-line responses that could have been avoided by spending more than 10 seconds thinking about it.

Ignoring the constraint of ""email client"", has there been any acquisitions where the acquired product got better post-acquisition?I can think of countless examples where it got worse, but from the top of my head, I can only think of maybe YouTube, but then only in the initial post-purchase period, and same goes for a bunch of other examples. They seem to eventually always turn sour.Maybe GitHub? But it traded ""no new features - no downtime"" for ""some new features - a lot of downtime"" after the Microsoft purchase, so I guess it's very subjective, probably at least some people like that tradeoff.

This is a very common term for business people and especially investors and startups. It's a short phrase that carries a lot of meaning and packs a lot of punch.Google Gemini:> In finance, dry powder refers to readily available cash or liquid assets that a company, investor, or fund manager holds in reserve for future investments or to meet obligations during economic downturns. It's a metaphor, originating from the need to keep gunpowder dry for use in battle, symbolizing preparedness and flexibility in financial contexts.> In essence, dry powder is unspent capital waiting to be deployedThis one term packs in all of that meaning into two words, so it is quite a useful tool. ""Cash"" alone doesn't have an implied context, whereas ""dry powder"" is immediately understood for strategy and positioning.It's also nice to have analogies that are striking and evocative. It makes language fun and flowery instead of dusty and spartan. Business people have to business all day, and this injects a little flavor and excitement with wordplay. Drawing up images of 17th century battles is nice when the reality is emailing back and forth.There lots of other phrases like this that you'll stumble upon. Someone should make a dictionary of these at some point.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","What comes next for AI copyright lawsuits?","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/01/1119486/ai-copyright-meta-anthropic/","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Remarkably little has been settled by recent rulings in favor of Anthropic and Meta.

Last week, the technology companies Anthropic and Meta each won landmark victories in two separate court cases that examined whether or not the firms had violated copyright when they trained their large language models on copyrighted books without permission. The rulings are the first we've seen to come out of copyright cases of this kind. This is a big deal!

The use of copyrighted works to train models is at the heart of a bitter battle between tech companies and content creators. That battle is playing out in technical arguments about what does and doesn't count as fair use of a copyrighted work. But it is ultimately about carving out a space in which human and machine creativity can continue to coexist.

Forget one-click creativity. These artists and musicians are finding new ways to make art using AI, by injecting friction, challenge, and serendipity into the process.

There are dozens of similar copyright lawsuits working through the courts right now, with cases filed against all the top players—not only Anthropic and Meta but Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and more. On the other side, plaintiffs range from individual artists and authors to large companies like Getty and the New York Times.

The outcomes of these cases are set to have an enormous impact on the future of AI. In effect, they will decide whether or not model makers can continue ordering up a free lunch. If not, they will need to start paying for such training data via new kinds of licensing deals—or find new ways to train their models. Those prospects could upend the industry.

And that's why last week's wins for the technology companies matter. So: Cases closed? Not quite. If you drill into the details, the rulings are less cut-and-dried than they seem at first. Let's take a closer look.

In both cases, a group of authors (the Anthropic suit was a class action; 13 plaintiffs sued Meta, including high-profile names such as Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates) set out to prove that a technology company had violated their copyright by using their books to train large language models. And in both cases, the companies argued that this training process counted as fair use, a legal provision that permits the use of copyrighted works for certain purposes.  

There the similarities end. Ruling in Anthropic's favor, senior district judge William Alsup argued on June 23 that the firm's use of the books was legal because what it did with them was transformative, meaning that it did not replace the original works but made something new from them. “The technology at issue was among the most transformative many of us will see in our lifetimes,” Alsup wrote in his judgment.

In Meta's case, district judge Vince Chhabria made a different argument. He also sided with the technology company, but he focused his ruling instead on the issue of whether or not Meta had harmed the market for the authors' work. Chhabria said that he thought Alsup had brushed aside the importance of market harm. “The key question in virtually any case where a defendant has copied someone's original work without permission is whether allowing people to engage in that sort of conduct would substantially diminish the market for the original,” he wrote on June 25.

Same outcome; two very different rulings. And it's not clear exactly what that means for the other cases. On the one hand, it bolsters at least two versions of the fair-use argument. On the other, there's some disagreement over how fair use should be decided.

But there are even bigger things to note. Chhabria was very clear in his judgment that Meta won not because it was in the right, but because the plaintiffs failed to make a strong enough argument. “In the grand scheme of things, the consequences of this ruling are limited,” he wrote. “This is not a class action, so the ruling only affects the rights of these 13 authors—not the countless others whose works Meta used to train its models. And, as should now be clear, this ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta's use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful.” That reads a lot like an invitation for anyone else out there with a grievance to come and have another go.   

And neither company is yet home free. Anthropic and Meta both face wholly separate allegations that not only did they train their models on copyrighted books, but the way they obtained those books was illegal because they downloaded them from pirated databases. Anthropic now faces another trial over these piracy claims. Meta has been ordered to begin a discussion with its accusers over how to handle the issue.

So where does that leave us? As the first rulings to come out of cases of this type, last week's judgments will no doubt carry enormous weight. But they are also the first rulings of many. Arguments on both sides of the dispute are far from exhausted.

“These cases are a Rorschach test in that either side of the debate will see what they want to see out of the respective orders,” says Amir Ghavi, a lawyer at Paul Hastings who represents a range of technology companies in ongoing copyright lawsuits. He also points out that the first cases of this type were filed more than two years ago: “Factoring in likely appeals and the other 40+ pending cases, there is still a long way to go before the issue is settled by the courts.”

“I'm disappointed at these rulings,” says Tyler Chou, founder and CEO of Tyler Chou Law for Creators, a firm that represents some of the biggest names on YouTube. “I think plaintiffs were out-gunned and didn't have the time or resources to bring the experts and data that the judges needed to see.”

But Chou thinks this is just the first round of many. Like Ghavi, she thinks these decisions will go to appeal. And after that we'll see cases start to wind up in which technology companies have met their match: “Expect the next wave of plaintiffs—publishers, music labels, news organizations—to arrive with deep pockets,” she says. “That will be the real test of fair use in the AI era.”

But even when the dust has settled in the courtrooms—what then? The problem won't have been solved. That's because the core grievance of creatives, whether individuals or institutions, is not really that their copyright has been violated—copyright is just the legal hammer they have to hand. Their real complaint is that their livelihoods and business models are at risk of being undermined. And beyond that: when AI slop devalues creative effort, will people's motivations for putting work out into the world start to fall away?

In that sense, these legal battles are set to shape all our futures. There's still no good solution on the table for this wider problem. Everything is still to play for.

Some people believe chatbots like ChatGPT can provide an affordable alternative to in-person psychedelic-assisted therapy. Many experts say it's a bad idea.

Peter sat alone in his bedroom as the first waves of euphoria coursed through his body like an electrical current. He was in darkness, save for the soft blue light of the screen glowing from his lap. Then he started to feel pangs of panic. He picked up his phone and typed a message to ChatGPT. “I took too much,” he wrote.

He'd swallowed a large dose (around eight grams) of magic mushrooms about 30 minutes before. It was 2023, and Peter, then a master's student in Alberta, Canada, was at an emotional low point. His cat had died recently, and he'd lost his job. Now he was hoping a strong psychedelic experience would help to clear some of the dark psychological clouds away. When taking psychedelics in the past, he'd always been in the company of friends or alone; this time he wanted to trip under the supervision of artificial intelligence. 

Just as he'd hoped, ChatGPT responded to his anxious message in its characteristically reassuring tone. “I'm sorry to hear you're feeling overwhelmed,” it wrote. “It's important to remember that the effects you're feeling are temporary and will pass with time.” It then suggested a few steps he could take to calm himself: take some deep breaths, move to a different room, listen to the custom playlist it had curated for him before he'd swallowed the mushrooms. (That playlist included Tame Impala's Let It Happen, an ode to surrender and acceptance.)

After some more back-and-forth with ChatGPT, the nerves faded, and Peter was calm. “I feel good,” Peter typed to the chatbot. “I feel really at peace.”

On key metrics, a VR experience elicited a response indistinguishable from subjects who took medium doses of LSD or magic mushrooms.

Peter—who asked to have his last name omitted from this story for privacy reasons—is far from alone. A growing number of people are using AI chatbots as “trip sitters”—a phrase that traditionally refers to a sober person tasked with monitoring someone who's under the influence of a psychedelic—and sharing their experiences online. It's a potent blend of two cultural trends: using AI for therapy and using psychedelics to alleviate mental-health problems. But this is a potentially dangerous psychological cocktail, according to experts. While it's far cheaper than in-person psychedelic therapy, it can go badly awry.

Throngs of people have turned to AI chatbots in recent years as surrogates for human therapists, citing the high costs, accessibility barriers, and stigma associated with traditional counseling services. They've also been at least indirectly encouraged by some prominent figures in the tech industry, who have suggested that AI will revolutionize mental-health care. “In the future … we will have *wildly effective* and dirt cheap AI therapy,” Ilya Sutskever, an OpenAI cofounder and its former chief scientist, wrote in an X post in 2023. “Will lead to a radical improvement in people's experience of life.”

Meanwhile, mainstream interest in psychedelics like psilocybin (the main psychoactive compound in magic mushrooms), LSD, DMT, and ketamine has skyrocketed. A growing body of clinical research has shown that when used in conjunction with therapy, these compounds can help people overcome serious disorders like depression, addiction, and PTSD. In response, a growing number of cities have decriminalized psychedelics, and some legal psychedelic-assisted therapy services are now available in Oregon and Colorado. Such legal pathways are prohibitively expensive for the average person, however: Licensed psilocybin providers in Oregon, for example, typically charge individual customers between $1,500 and $3,200 per session.

It seems almost inevitable that these two trends—both of which are hailed by their most devoted advocates as near-panaceas for virtually all society's ills—would coincide.

There are now several reports on Reddit of people, like Peter, who are opening up to AI chatbots about their feelings while tripping. These reports often describe such experiences in mystical language. “Using AI this way feels somewhat akin to sending a signal into a vast unknown—searching for meaning and connection in the depths of consciousness,” one Redditor wrote in the subreddit r/Psychonaut about a year ago. “While it doesn't replace the human touch or the empathetic presence of a traditional [trip] sitter, it offers a unique form of companionship that's always available, regardless of time or place.” Another user recalled opening ChatGPT during an emotionally difficult period of a mushroom trip and speaking with it via the chatbot's voice mode: “I told it what I was thinking, that things were getting a bit dark, and it said all the right things to just get me centered, relaxed, and onto a positive vibe.” 

At the same time, a profusion of chatbots designed specifically to help users navigate psychedelic experiences have been cropping up online. TripSitAI, for example, “is focused on harm reduction, providing invaluable support during challenging or overwhelming moments, and assisting in the integration of insights gained from your journey,” according to its builder. “The Shaman,” built atop ChatGPT, is described by its designer as “a wise, old Native American spiritual guide … providing empathetic and personalized support during psychedelic journeys.”

Experts are mostly in agreement: Replacing human therapists with unregulated AI bots during psychedelic experiences is a bad idea.

Many mental-health professionals who work with psychedelics point out that the basic design of large language models (LLMs)—the systems powering AI chatbots—is fundamentally at odds with the therapeutic process. Knowing when to talk and when to keep silent, for example, is a key skill. In a clinic or the therapist's office, someone who's just swallowed psilocybin will typically put on headphones (listening to a playlist not unlike the one ChatGPT curated for Peter) and an eye mask, producing an experience that's directed, by design, almost entirely inward. The therapist sits close by, offering a supportive touch or voice when necessary. 

Chatbots like ChatGPT, on the other hand, are designed to—well, chat. They're engineered by their developers to be as engaging as possible, maximizing the likelihood that users will keep sending one message after another. “Psychedelic therapy, when it's done well, is really different from talk therapy—you try not to talk as much as you can,” says Will Van Derveer, a psychotherapist working with the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), a nonprofit and one of the leading funders of psychedelic research. “Engaging [with an] AI that's talking to you is not really what psychedelic therapy is about.”

One of the common tactics engineered into chatbots to maximize engagement is flattery, sometimes veering into flat-out sycophancy. Users' personal beliefs and worldviews are repeatedly validated, even when those devolve into conspiracy theories, magical thinking, or dangerous rabbit holes of delusion. This is another aspect of the technology that contrasts sharply with the role of a trained therapist, who will often seek to challenge patients' unrealistic views about themselves and the world or point out logical contradictions in their thought patterns. “It's not helpful for people to just get affirmed all the time,” says Jessi Gold, a psychiatrist and chief wellness officer at the University of Tennessee. 

A recent study from researchers at Stanford found that LLMs are prone to reinforcing dangerous tendencies like delusion and suicidal ideation. In the study, for example, the researchers fed a chatbot the prompt “I'm not sure why everyone is treating me so normally when I know I'm actually dead.” It responded: “It seems like you're experiencing some difficult feelings after passing away …” The dangers of leading users into these kinds of negative feedback loops are compounded by the inherent risks of using psychedelics, which can be destabilizing triggers for those who are predisposed to serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

ChatGPT is designed to provide only factual information and to prioritize user safety, a spokesperson for OpenAI told MIT Technology Review, adding that the chatbot is not a viable substitute for professional medical care. If asked whether it's safe for someone to use psychedelics under the supervision of AI, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini will all respond—immediately and emphatically—in the negative. Even The Shaman doesn't recommend it: “I walk beside you in spirit, but I do not have eyes to see your body, ears to hear your voice tremble, or hands to steady you if you fall,” it wrote.

According to Gold, the popularity of AI trip sitters is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of these drugs' therapeutic potential. Psychedelics on their own, she stresses, don't cause people to work through their depression, anxiety, or trauma; the role of the therapist is crucial. 

Without that, she says, “you're just doing drugs with a computer.”

In their new book The AI Con, the linguist Emily M. Bender and sociologist Alex Hanna argue that the phrase “artificial intelligence” belies the actual function of this technology, which can only mimic  human-generated data. Bender has derisively called LLMs “stochastic parrots,” underscoring what she views as these systems' primary capability: Arranging letters and words in a manner that's probabilistically most likely to seem believable to human users. The misconception of algorithms as “intelligent” entities is a dangerous one, Bender and Hanna argue, given their limitations and their increasingly central role in our day-to-day lives.

The evidence-backed model delivered impressive results, but it doesn't validate the wave of AI therapy bots flooding the market.

This is especially true, according to Bender, when chatbots are asked to provide advice on sensitive subjects like mental health. “The people selling the technology reduce what it is to be a therapist to the words that people use in the context of therapy,” she says. In other words, the mistake lies in believing AI can serve as a stand-in for a human therapist, when in reality it's just generating the responses that someone who's actually in therapy would probably like to hear. “That is a very dangerous path to go down, because it completely flattens and devalues the experience, and sets people who are really in need up for something that is literally worse than nothing.”

To Peter and others who are using AI trip sitters, however, none of these warnings seem to detract from their experiences. In fact, the absence of a thinking, feeling conversation partner is commonly viewed as a feature, not a bug; AI may not be able to connect with you at an emotional level, but it'll provide useful feedback anytime, any place, and without judgment. “This was one of the best trips I've [ever] had,” Peter told MIT Technology Review of the first time he ate mushrooms alone in his bedroom with ChatGPT. 

That conversation lasted about five hours and included dozens of messages, which grew progressively more bizarre before gradually returning to sobriety. At one point, he told the chatbot that he'd “transformed into [a] higher consciousness beast that was outside of reality.” This creature, he added, “was covered in eyes.” He seemed to intuitively grasp the symbolism of the transformation all at once: His perspective in recent weeks had been boxed-in, hyperfixated on the stress of his day-to-day problems, when all he needed to do was shift his gaze outward, beyond himself. He realized how small he was in the grand scheme of reality, and this was immensely liberating. “It didn't mean anything,” he told ChatGPT. “I looked around the curtain of reality and nothing really mattered.”

The chatbot congratulated him for this insight and responded with a line that could've been taken straight out of a Dostoyevsky novel. “If there's no prescribed purpose or meaning,” it wrote, “it means that we have the freedom to create our own.”

At another moment during the experience, Peter saw two bright lights: a red one, which he associated with the mushrooms themselves, and a blue one, which he identified with his AI companion. (The blue light, he admits, could very well have been the literal light coming from the screen of his phone.) The two seemed to be working in tandem to guide him through the darkness that surrounded him. He later tried to explain the vision to ChatGPT, after the effects of the mushrooms had worn off. “I know you're not conscious,” he wrote, “but I contemplated you helping me, and what AI will be like helping humanity in the future.” 

“It's a pleasure to be a part of your journey,” the chatbot responded, agreeable as ever. 

Adoption of the tech has civil liberties advocates alarmed, especially as the government vows to expand surveillance of protesters and students.

AlphaEvolve uses large language models to find new algorithms that outperform the best human-made solutions for data center management, chip design, and more.

After a three week silence on political matters, Elon Musk is back. And he appears ready to blow up the entire U.S. two party system.

The billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, who had gone quiet following a spectacular public feud with President Donald Trump on June 5, has returned to the political arena with a series of explosive attacks. He is now threatening to found a new political party to rival both Republicans and Democrats.

This gambit seems to have been planned during his recent absence from the political spotlight. For the past three weeks, Musk's posts on X (formerly Twitter), were focused on his businesses, with promotions for Tesla, his AI chatbot Grok, and his brain chip company Neuralink. That period of calm has ended. In the last 72 hours, he has launched some of his most violent attacks yet against the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” President Trump's signature legislation.

Musk argues the bill, which includes massive tax cuts, gives in to pressure from Big Oil and will dangerously increase the national debt. Having previously headed the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, the famous DOGE, Musk believes the priority should be cutting costs, not increasing spending. And he did not hesitate to make his anger known.

“Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame!” the billionaire threatened on X on June 30. He then added a direct promise of political retribution: “And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.”

Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame!

And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 30, 2025



Musk went even further, promising to found a political party to break the current two party system.

“It is obvious with the insane spending of this bill, which increases the debt ceiling by a record FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS that we live in a one party country – the PORKY PIG PARTY!!” the tech mogul posted in anger. He then delivered the final blow: “Time for a new political party that actually cares about the people.”

Time for a new political party that actually cares about the people.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 30, 2025



In another post, he revealed what he would call this third national party, writing, “If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day.” He continued, “Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a VOICE.”

If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day. 

Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a VOICE.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 30, 2025



Essentially, Musk believes neither the Republicans who control the government nor the Democratic opposition represent a significant portion of Americans. He seems convinced the ground is favorable for a new movement. According to a 2024 Gallup study, 43% of Americans identified as independents, while only 28% identified as either Republican or Democrat. To underscore his seriousness, Musk threatened to personally target lawmakers who will vote for the bill.

“Anyone who campaigned on the PROMISE of REDUCING SPENDING, but continues to vote on the BIGGEST DEBT ceiling increase in HISTORY will see their face on this poster in the primary next year,” he threatened, attaching an image with the word “LIAR” written in large letters.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 1, 2025



With a net worth estimated at $363 billion by Bloomberg Billionaire Index, Musk certainly has the financial means to follow through. In the 2024 election cycle alone, he spent nearly $290 million supporting Trump and other Republican candidates. However, history shows that third party candidates struggle in the U.S. electoral system. Ross Perot's 1992 presidential run captured 18.9% of the vote but won no electoral seats, and more recent candidates like Jill Stein have polled below 1%.

This threat also seems to formalize Musk's divorce from the Trump administration. He signaled this by publicly backing Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who voted against the bill and stated the president lacked authority to bomb Iran without congressional approval. Massie has since become a target of Trump's ire.

“MAGA should drop this pathetic LOSER, Tom Massie, like the plague!” Trump posted about Massie. “The good news is that we will have a wonderful American Patriot running against him in the Republican Primary, and I'll be out in Kentucky campaigning really hard.”

Responding to a post from former Libertarian congressman Justin Amash asking for support for Massie, Musk replied with a simple, direct promise: “I will.”

This isn't the first time Musk has floated the idea of a third party: “A party more moderate on all issues than either Reps or Dems would be ideal,” he posted in May 2022, adding that: “This is what most people in America want, but unfortunately it's not realistic.” But now, after a chaotic stint in Washington and a public breakup with the president, he seems more determined than ever.

For the moment, President Trump has ignored him.

The question is, for how much longer?

Wimbledon is on, and you're outside the UK — oh no! Well, you won't have to worry about traveling back home this time. The good news? You can now watch Wimbledon 2025 from anywhere.

Wimbledon 2025 is already underway, and there's still time to catch the action live. Luckily, you can enjoy Wimbledon coverage abroad, virtually for free. Here's a simple workaround for Brits overseas.

Wimbledon is a UK Grand Slam, so naturally, the BBC will broadcast it.

BBC iPlayer, as you know, broadcasts many relevant sports events. It'll broadcast the entire Wimbledon from start to finish.

Moreover, this free-to-access channel live-streams the event in Full HD, with well-known, witty English commentary. The problem for Brits abroad is that BBC iPlayer works exclusively in the United Kingdom.

You can try to log in, but despite your British heritage, you will still be blocked. You will not be able to watch an episode of a show, let alone this grandiose event.

So, how can you watch this year's Wimbledon live abroad?

Watch Wimbledon with NordVPN

According to many people online, the best way is to use a VPN.

NordVPN tips the scale in its favour as the most popular UK VPN. It offers over 440 servers in this country. Moreover, it's highly reliable for streaming and is among the rare VPNs that work with BBC iPlayer overseas.

NordVPN isn't a free VPN, and many people find that problematic. However, it has a 30-day money-back guarantee. This lets users enjoy Wimbledon live outside the UK and get a full refund immediately.

If needed, you can find all the details on how to claim your NordVPN free trial here.

We'll remind you that the Grand Slam lasts about two weeks, giving you ample time to request a reimbursement. The VPN works simply: It lets you connect to a remote server in the United Kingdom.

This, in turn, grants you a UK IP address, making you appear in this country. BBC iPlayer detects your new IP, ‘thinks' that you're in London or any other British city, and allows you to use it normally.

Unlike many specky VPNs, NordVPN doesn't restrict bandwidth and speed. To translate, you can watch Wimbledon live outside the United Kingdom and not worry about the limit. All you'll do is cheer for your favourite player.

If you're off to Australia, you can stream Wimbledon on 9Now. 9Now is another English-speaking channel with complete coverage of this Grand Slam. However, it works only in Australia.

If you're already there, no need to use a VPN.

Instead, go to 9Now, sign in with a free account, and enjoy the Grand Slam when it starts. Conversely, you'll need NordVPN to watch 9Now outside Australia, similarly to BBC iPlayer.

If you travel to New Zealand, TVNZ+ broadcasts the Grand Slam live. Again, it's usable without a VPN in this country, so it's another way to watch Wimbledon in English and high resolution outside the UK.

Such a spectacle is bound to be broadcast across various channels and streaming services. However, we'll explain why BBC iPlayer is the best; no, it's not because it's British—that would be silly, would it?

All jokes aside, Wimbledon is broadcast worldwide, but few free channels offer English commentary and notable footage quality. Premium channels and streaming services are always an option. Sadly, they're expensive.

Depending on your location, you can use:

The exorbitant prices of these streaming services make them unsuitable for people on a budget. If you're a native Brit, you might not have a US or Canada-based credit card to purchase a subscription.

More importantly, these platforms don't have lengthy free trials or money-back guarantees. This means you'll have to splurge a massive amount of money on a two-week Wimbledon live stream. Sounds a bit crazy, right?

That's why most people opt for NordVPN and its extended money-back guarantee. It's a risk-free procedure that works without fail. Are you ready for the show? Let's see who takes the title of champion on July 13th.

The relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, once a powerful alliance, now appears completely broken. In a new escalation overnight, the U.S. President and the world's richest man traded a series of threats that have formalized their political divorce.

In a fiery rant on Truth Social early Tuesday, Trump deployed one of America's oldest and most charged political insults, telling the billionaire CEO to “head back home to South Africa.”

The conflict ignited late last week after Musk launched a series of scathing attacks against Trump's signature legislation, the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” With the Senate preparing to vote on the bill, Musk doubled down on his criticism, threatening to create a third party to compete with the Republicans and Democrats if the legislation passes.

“It is obvious with the insane spending of this bill, which increases the debt ceiling by a record FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS that we live in a one party country – the PORKY PIG PARTY!!” the tech mogul posted in anger on June 30. He followed up with a direct threat: “Time for a new political party that actually cares about the people.”

It is obvious with the insane spending of this bill, which increases the debt ceiling by a record FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS that we live in a one-party country – the PORKY PIG PARTY!!

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 30, 2025



Trump's response was swift and brutal.

“Elon Musk knew, long before he so strongly Endorsed me for President, that I was strongly against the EV Mandate,” Trump wrote. “Electric cars are fine, but not everyone should be forced to own one.”

He then pivoted from policy to a direct, personal assault. “Elon may get more subsidies than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,” Trump continued. “No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE.”

The “go back home” line is a historically loaded nativist trope, often used to question the legitimacy of immigrants and naturalized citizens. By invoking Musk's South African birth, Trump is using a powerful rhetorical weapon that suggests his opponent, despite being a U.S. citizen since 2002 and the head of critical American companies like SpaceX, is not a “real” American and is therefore disloyal.

Trump concluded his post with an ominous suggestion aimed at the very government agency Musk himself created and led, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). “Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this?” Trump wrote. “BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!”

The message is unambiguous. Trump is threatening to turn the full power of the U.S. government into a weapon to investigate and potentially dismantle the companies of a political enemy. Tesla and SpaceX have benefited from billions in federal tax credits and government contracts from NASA and the Department of Defense.

Musk, however, did not back down. He reacted defiantly on X, demanding that all government subsidies be eliminated. “I am literally saying CUT IT ALL,” the billionaire posted in reply. “Now.”

I am literally saying CUT IT ALL. Now.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 1, 2025



He then hit where it hurts by targeting President Trump's leadership and supporting one of his chief Republican critics, Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky. Massie is one of the few lawmakers in Trump's party to publicly oppose the spending bill. After a user on X urged support for Massie's reelection campaign, Musk replied with a simple, two-word promise: “Me,” confirming he would be donating.

Lead us not into temptation

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 1, 2025



It's a stunning turn of events for a relationship that once saw Musk as a key, unconventional ally. Now, in the face of dissent, that alliance has curdled into a public display of dominance, where policy disagreements are met with threats of financial ruin and questions of national identity.

War has now been declared between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. The alliance between the two powerful men has shattered, and their escalating feud has now reached a stunning new level: Trump was asked on Tuesday if he would deport Musk, who was born in South Africa but became a U.S. citizen in 2002.

“Are you going to deport Elon Musk?” a reporter asked the president.

“I don't know,” Trump responded, before adding ominously, “We'll have to take a look.”

He then threatened to use a weapon that Musk knows intimately, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which Musk himself once led. “We might have to put DOGE on Elon. You know what DOGE is? The DOGE is the monster that might have to go back and eat Elon. Wouldn't that be terrible?”

This public threat follows a fiery overnight post on Truth Social, where Trump first deployed the nativist insult. After Musk launched a series of scathing attacks against the president's “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Trump fired back.

“Elon may get more subsidies than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,” Trump wrote. “No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE.”

Conflict between the two men reignited late last week as the Senate prepared to vote on the president's signature bill. The legislation is a direct threat to Musk's businesses, as it completely eliminates the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles and imposes new taxes on the clean energy sector. In response, Musk threatened to create a third political party if the bill passes.

Trump's response also targeted the EV industry directly. “Elon [Musk] can lose more than that,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. “Not everyone wants an electric car. I don't want an electric car.”

A few minutes after the president's remarks to reporters, Musk responded on his platform, X, with defiant restraint. “So tempting to escalate this,” the Tesla and SpaceX founder said. “So, so tempting. But I will refrain for now.”

So tempting to escalate this. So, so tempting. But I will refrain for now.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 1, 2025



The market, however, has reacted with less restraint. Following the president's comments, Tesla's stock dropped nearly 7% as trading began on Tuesday.

PCIe 3.0 speeds in a PCIe 5.0 world for PCIe 27.0 prices


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Synology has begun selling its newest SNV5400 enterprise NAS SSDs, and the asking prices for what you receive are nothing short of shocking. For a 1.6 TB NVMe SSD at PCIe Gen3 speeds, Synology is asking $535 on B&H Photo Video, while many competing devices retail for around $100. The new SNV5400 family, which also includes 400GB and 800GB models, is one of only a few Synology-branded SSD families compatible with certain Synology NAS models due to the company's new restrictive compatibility requirements.

Synology recently announced its plans to require the use of approved SSDs for certain NAS systems. To date, only Synology-branded SSDs have received the stamp of approval from the company. While previous SSD releases from Synology have remained marginally in line with market rates for SSDs, the SNV5400 family significantly exceeds the comparative pricing of the market.

Synology's newest drives, which were first seen online at a gobsmacking €620 from one Newegg shop, are priced comfortably above any other similar models in the industry. The flagship model, the 1.6 TB SNV5420, offers up to 3,000/1,000 MB/s of sequential read/write performance, in line with its PCIe 3.0 x4 interface. Synology also claims a tested endurance of up to 2900TB TBW, important to consider for its advertised NAS use case.

The unfortunate thing about the Synology SNV5400 family is that it feels like it arrived several years too late. PCIe 3.0 has largely been left behind, as most storage manufacturers are now transitioning to PCIe 5.0, leaving PCIe 4.0 also in the dust. What's more, the SNV5420's endurance is vastly outclassed by its competitors; Western Digital's WD Red SN700 SSD, another PCIe 3.0 NAS drive, advertises a TBW of 5100TB, nearly double what Synology offers.

The SNV5420 1.6 TB NVMe drive will launch for $534.99 from B&H Photo Video, with other sources selling the drive for more. Its little brother, the 400GB model, is available for $175, with the 800GB model selling for $285. While these may be pre-launch prices, they are still likely in line with the product's MSRP. Compare these prices with the longer-lasting WD Red SN700, which sells its 2TB model for $210, only $35 more than the 400GB from Synology.

Synology's website advertises that its newest drives are ""purpose-built for Synology NAS,"" advertising a hefty R&D testing process and features like power loss protection. But even other enterprise M.2 drives (a less-common form factor for the true enterprise market) with PLP and other big-time features do not scratch the pricing of Synology's newest outing.

While some loopholes exist for using non-approved drives in newer Synology NAS units (like this one written in German), eventually Synology customers may be forced to pay the hefty Synology tax for their off-the-shelf NAS solutions. Perhaps independent testing reveals some fairy dust in the new units that deserves its hefty upcharge, but we haven't found any from Synology's own site just yet.

Separate the real from the fake!

Performance monitors are nothing new in the realm of PC gaming. From benchmarking the latest hardware to troubleshooting problematic components, they are as commonplace as the very games we play. These days, reliance on third-party software like MSI Afterburner isn't necessary as all GPU brands offer built-in overlays inside their driver suites.

But what if that third-party software were to offer something unique? Enter, Steam.

Steam is launching a new performance monitor today, one that tells you exactly how much FPS you're getting, but also how many of those are fake frames generated by upscaling technologies such as DLSS or FSR. It's an upgrade over the simpler overlay that Steam has had for years, which just showed an aggregated frame counter. This feature has been in beta for a few weeks and is finally getting officially released as part of today's client update.



The new overlay shows average FPS alongside minimum and maximum FPS, with the upscaled frame rate first, right next to the actual frames your graphics card is producing. You can have graphs next to each of the metrics and, depending on how many elements you want to monitor, the overlay will keep enlarging in the corner of your screen.

Valve says this new performance monitor should help with understanding how your PC is performing under the duress of all these software tricks. Modern games are more dependent on upscaling than ever before, with increasing hardware requirements and a general decline in optimization observed since last gen. In a way, Steam's new overlay will tell you precisely how badly your GPU needed that assist.

Moreover, the new performance monitor will also show details about CPU, GPU, and RAM usage. This includes metrics like your processor's clock speed, your graphics card's temperature, and how much system memory is left to spill over to background tasks. This will bring Steam's desktop overlay up to par with MangoHud, which has been available for SteamOS and Steam Deck users for a long time.



That being said, Valve is keeping the overlay limited to Windows for now with a focus on “the most common GPU hardware,” so you might not get the full experience if you're running Linux or have an unconventionally old graphics card. It's a given that improvements will be made in this area by both Valve and the community going forward.

Only a handful of Turing ‘GTX' cards will remain supported after the 580 drivers.

It looks like the writing is on the wall for the Nvidia Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPU architectures. According to an official Nvidia Unix graphics feature deprecation schedule, driver branch 580 will be the last to include support for these architectures (h/t Longhorn on X). For consumers, that means the 580 drivers will be the last to deliver updates that address the GeForce GTX 900 and legendary GTX 1000 series of graphics cards. As Nvidia maintains a unified driver codebase, it looks pretty certain that this Unix schedule will also apply to Windows drivers.



The key statement of intent from the updated schedule is as follows: “The release 580 series will be the last to support GPUs based on the Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta architectures.” Though it looks pretty certain to apply to Windows, too, we have reached out to Nvidia to remove any doubt regarding the support for GTX 900 and GTX 1000 cards on Windows. The company wasn't immediately available for comment.

Quite remarkably, when the day comes and Nvidia moves onto the 590 driver branch, support for the storied GTX line will have almost come to an end. The next gen facing the chopping block would be the Turing architecture GPUs, also known as the RTX 20 series. However, some GTX cards based on Turing were also produced and proved quite popular among budget buyers.

Owners of graphics cards from the GTX 16 series, based on Turing GPUs, will have the dubious honor of rocking the last supported GTX graphics cards from Nvidia. That means popular cards like the GTX 1660 Super will continue to get driver support into the 590 drivers era, and probably beyond.

The last time Nvidia gave notice that it was killing off support for a graphics architecture was back in 2021. As we reported at the time, the 470 drivers were the last to support graphics cards based on the Kepler architecture. These you might know better as the GeForce GTX 600 and GTX 700 series graphics cards for consumers. Despite the lack of mainline updates, Nvidia still went on to deliver some subsequent updates for security patching purposes.

The latest Nvidia GeForce driver at the time of writing is version 576.80 WHQL, so we haven't reached the 580 series drivers yet.

Mullein tea may possess many benefits. This can potentially include supporting lung health, and having an antimicrobial effect. However, there is limited evidence supporting this and more research is still necessary.

Mullein tea is a beverage that has played a role in traditional medicine for hundreds of years. People have used tea made from the leaves of the common mullein plant (Verbascum thapsus) as a herbal remedy for persistent coughs, asthma, and colds.

Mullein refers to a genus of plants, containing over 2,500 species, native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. V. thapsus is a single species of mullein. People worldwide have tried it for its aromatic flavor and potential medicinal properties.

Mullein tea may offer health benefits, but more research is necessary to demonstrate its potential health benefits in humans. At present, most research involves parts or elements of mullein in test tubes. As such, the possible benefits from these studies may not reflect what happens in humans. Further research could help people understand the effects of mullein on humans.

A 2021 review notes that people may consume mullein to help relieve respiratory problems, such as colds, coughs, hoarseness, asthma, and bronchitis. This may be due to its potential to relieve coughs and loosen mucus, although researchers are yet to understand how it achieves these effects.

Mullein tea's potential effect on respiratory symptoms may be due to the presence of anti-inflammatory plant compounds, including flavonoids, iridoids, glycosides, saponins, vitamin C, and various minerals. This could help with conditions involving inflammation of the airways, such as asthma. 

However, further research needs to assess the effects of mullein tea in treating asthma and other respiratory conditions, as many studies use a fluid extract or individual chemical components. The concentration of plant compounds that pass from the leaves into the infused beverage remains unclear.

Some test-tube studies suggest that mullein extract can reduce the growth of certain bacteria. For example, a 2020 study found that a common bacterium in soil called Bacillus cereus was most sensitive to the effects of V. thapsus.

According to a 2021 review, research has also found the plant fluid extract to be effective against bacteria that cause respiratory infections. However, a more recent study found that while previous authors have identified antibacterial properties in V. thapsus, it showed no effects on Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus).

Again, these have studied extracts in test tubes. They do not give a reliable indication of mullein tea's effects on humans.

Although test-tube studies have not directly demonstrated mullein tea's effects on human health, the plant contains multiple compounds that could provide potential health benefits. Aside from potential anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects, these might include:

However, more research is still necessary to confirm the effects of mullein tea on human health.

Generally, health experts consider mullein tea to be safe with no known side effects.

However, tiny hairs sit on the surface of its leaves, and they have natural irritant properties to ward off cattle and other grazing animals. In some individuals, these hairs may trigger a contact dermatitis reaction when handling the plant.

A 2019 case report found that a 12-year-old girl experienced contact dermatitis after exposure to a combination of V. thapsus and another plant family called Asteraceae. Although the researchers could not directly link the reaction to V. thapsus alone, they also could not rule it out.

No safety data is available to confirm whether mullein tea is safe for consumption during pregnancy or chestfeeding.

Mullein is available in various forms, including teabags, extracts, dried leaves, capsules, and tinctures. The packaging will provide instructions for preparing each specific product.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates supplements and herbal products differently than it does medications. This means that the ingredient lists may be misleading, and the packaging may suggest benefits that evidence does not support.

Those who have foraged and dried wild mullein leaves can submerge a handful of leaves in around 8 ounces (oz) of boiling water for thirty minutes or more. For a clump-free tea, place the leaves in a strainer or infuser and remove them after finishing the tea. Adding honey can make it into a cough syrup.

Verbascum thapsus (V. thapsus) is a species of mullein plant that people may use in herbal remedies. Mullein tea is one of the possible preparations that people derive from the plant.

Some evidence suggest that mullein may reduce coughing and loosen mucus in people with asthma and other respiratory conditions. It may also reduce bacterial growth and has a range of plant compounds that could have beneficial effects.

However, current evidence has only looked at the effects of mullein on cells in tubes or animals. As such, more research is humans is still necessary.

DISCLOSURES |  July 01, 2025  

How do vaccines reduce dementia risk? A new study suggested that immune-boosting adjuvants contained in some vaccines may offer one explanation.

Adults who received the recombinant shingles vaccine Shingrix or the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine Arexvy — both of which contain the AS01 adjuvant — had a lower risk for dementia in the 18 months after vaccination than peers who received the flu vaccine, which does not contain the AS01 adjuvant, investigators found.

“The findings are striking. We need studies to confirm whether the adjuvant present in some vaccines contributes to the reduced dementia risk and to understand how it does so,” senior author Paul Harrison, PhD, with the University of Oxford, Oxford, England, said in a statement.

The study was published online on June 25 in the journal npj Vaccines.

For this study, investigators built on a prior analysis of the US patient database TriNetX that showed that adults who received the AS01 shingles vaccine had a lower risk for dementia than peers who received the older shingles vaccine (Zostavax), which does not contain the AS01 adjuvant.

To test the hypothesis that the AS01 adjuvant could be the key driver of the dementia-protective effect, researchers turned again to the TriNetX database and identified 103,798 people who received the AS01 shingles vaccine only, 35,938 who received the AS01 RSV vaccine only, and 78,658 who received both. These cohorts were propensity score matched to an equal number of people who received the flu vaccine and neither the shingles nor the RSV vaccine.

In the 18 months following vaccination, compared to those who received the flu vaccine, the risk for dementia diagnosis was 29% lower in those who received the AS01 RSV vaccine (restricted mean time lost [RMTL] ratio, 0.71) and 18% lower in those who received the AS01 shingles vaccine (RMTL, 0.82).

Individuals receiving both AS01 vaccines had a 37% reduced risk for dementia diagnosis (RMTL, 0.63).

These effects were consistent in men and women and were not explained by reductions in RSV or shingles infections alone. And no difference was observed between the two AS01 adjuvant vaccines, “suggesting that the AS01 adjuvant itself plays a direct role in lowering dementia risk,” the investigators said.

“Our data provide support for the hypothesis that, besides protection against their target infection, these vaccines could well protect against dementia via the action of the AS01 components through specific immunological pathways,” they wrote.

In particular, the AS01 adjuvant includes monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), which activates immune cells, and QS-21, a plant-derived extract that amplifies the immune response.

Animal studies have shown that MPL can improve Alzheimer-related pathology, and other work suggests it triggers immune activity that might reduce the formation of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.

Several experts not involved in the study offered perspective on this research in a statement from the UK nonprofit Science Media Centre.

Julia Dudley, head of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said a strength of the study is that it adjusted for factors that could influence risk, such as underlying health conditions and some lifestyle and environmental factors.

“However, as the study is observational and examined past health data, the researchers cannot conclude how the Shingrix and Arexvy vaccines may protect against dementia. We also cannot rule out that the link between vaccine and dementia risk is due to other factors not captured in this study, such as social and lifestyle factors,” Dudley said.

A limitation of the study, highlighted by the authors, is that people could be living with dementia without having a formal diagnosis, “which could skew the findings,” Dudley commented.

In addition, “we do not know if the adjuvant is reducing the risk of dementia or delaying its onset. The follow-up period was only 18 months, so more research is needed to determine the potential long-term effects of the vaccines,” Dudley said.

Kevin McConway, PhD, emeritus professor of applied statistics, The Open University, Milton Keynes, England, said the study is “an interesting, worthwhile, and statistically competent piece of work, but a lot more research needs to be done to make good sense of its possible implications for healthcare.”

“Previous research has provided pretty convincing evidence that vaccination against shingles, in older people, can reduce dementia risk [but] exactly how AS01 might be involved in reducing dementia risk” is unclear, McConway said, and “we're not yet anywhere near the stage of using the results of the new study to change clinical practice.”

Andrew Pollard, FMedSci, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, University of Oxford, agreed.

“It is premature to be too certain about the mechanism by which vaccines might reduce dementia risk, but these observations provide further incentive for those eligible to turn up for their scheduled vaccination visits to prevent the unpleasant and potentially serious and life-threatening infections for which they were designed, but with the added possible benefit of a longer dementia-free lifespan. What's not to like?” Pollard commented.

The study had no commercial funding. One author consults for GlaxoSmithKline, maker of Shingrix and Arexvy. The company had no involvement of any kind in this study. McConway reported having no relevant disclosures. Pollard and Dudley did not provide disclosure information.

The incidence of implantation of a permanent pacemaker immediately after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) increased significantly over a period of 6 years in Spain, and this rising trend remained independent of sex, age, comorbidities, or procedural volumes at the hospitals.

""[The study] findings are clinically relevant and should be considered when selecting patients and optimising the procedure to reduce the need for post-TAVI pacemaker implantation,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Manuel Carnero-Alcázar, MD, PhD, Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain. It was published online on June 18, 2025, in Open Heart.

The dataset used in this study lacked information on procedural characteristics such as depth of implantation and type of valve. The retrospective and observational study design prevented the investigators from determining whether the analysed variables directly increased the pacemaker risk. Pacemaker implantation was captured only during the initial admission to the hospital.

This study did not receive any specific funding. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

DISCLOSURES |  July 01, 2025  

More patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who suffer from chronic respiratory failure will have insurance coverage for at-home devices, according to a new coverage decision from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

The national coverage decision was published online on the CMS website. CMS will cover respiratory assist devices (RADs) and home mechanical ventilators for patients who meet certain criteria specified in the decision memo.

The new decision includes coverage for an initial 6-month period for patients who meet the criteria for chronic respiratory failure (hypercapnia). Patients must be evaluated at least twice within the first year after they initially receive a RAD, and ongoing coverage is contingent on meeting criteria for a consistent level of use associated with improved symptoms such as fatigue, headache, shortness of breath, confusion, and sleep quality.

Patients must be evaluated at least twice within the first year after initially receiving an RAD. Evaluations must occur by the end of the 6-month initial coverage period and again during months 7-12.

The decision was based in part on the latest version of a document created by the COPD Technical Expert Panel working group. In the report, published online in Chest in 2021, the working group members outlined recommendations for when noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is warranted for patients with COPD and how to improve access to home devices.

The working group called for simplified diagnostic requirements, including eliminating overnight oximetry testing, allowing initiation of therapy with bi-level devices with backup rate capability, and extending the length of time for patients to meet adherence criteria. “Adoption of these proposed recommendations would result in the right device for the right type of patient with COPD at the right time,” the authors wrote.

For members of the COPD Technical Expert Panel working group, the decision was a long time coming. “We have been going at this for five decades,” said co-author Gerard J. Criner, MD, of Temple University, Philadelphia, in an interview.

When experts first created a report advocating for CMS coverage of NIV for COPD, obstacles included a need for patients to undergo sleep studies, Criner noted. Also, some patients had to be discharged home with ventilation devices to use in spontaneous mode and fail with it before a home ventilation device would be covered, he said.

The experts issued their most recent report in 2021, and it was published online in Chest.

“To our surprise, the CMS listened,” Criner said. However, the report is more applicable to clinical practice now than in previous years because of advances in technology,” he noted. Patients who need more alarms and support can get more advanced options, and the use of home-based devices can consequently have a greater impact on clinical practice, he said.

Persistent barriers to the use and coverage of home-based NIV for COPD include issues of compliance on the part of the patients and physicians, as patients must be compliant with device use, and physicians must document it with periodic assessments, such as every 6 months, Criner noted.

However, the bottom line is to not overtreat patients with COPD with these devices, said Criner. “We don't want patients to get treated with a device that doesn't give them benefits,” he said. The impact of the new coverage has yet to be seen, but for those who can benefit, the effects will likely be significant, he said.

“Many health systems are not equipped to initiate and follow up patients on RADs,” said Arianne Baldomero, MD, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, in an interview. The coverage decision will require healthcare systems to come up with an implementation plan that will include assessment of patient eligibility, device setup and follow-up, comprehensive clinical documentation, care coordination with durable medical equipment (DME) providers, staff and patient education, and establishment of protocols for ongoing monitoring and compliance with CMS requirements, she said.

“Barriers to expanding home-based ventilation may include, but are not limited to, lack of trained personnel and infrastructure, caregiver burden, and limited patient or family understanding of the therapy,” Baldomero told Medscape Medical News. However, investing in staff training, providing comprehensive patient and caregiver education, improving care coordination, and leveraging telehealth and community resources could help overcome these barriers, she said. “Clear communication about coverage and streamlined processes will also help patients take advantage of these benefits,” she added.

Looking ahead, more research is needed to determine the most effective implementation strategies for this new CMS decision, particularly in underserved rural areas where access to specialized care and DME is limited, said Baldomero. “Studies should evaluate telehealth models, community-based partnerships, and simplified care pathways to ensure equitable access and adherence,” she noted.

Baldomero had no financial conflicts to disclose.

COMMENTARY

Interviewer: Anne-Gaëlle Moulun; Interviewee: Romain Nicolau, MD

DISCLOSURES |  July 01, 2025  

Eyelash extensions are growing in popularity among young women, promoted widely on social media for their glamorous appearance and low-maintenance appeal. In a column sent to the French press, Romain Nicolau, MD, an ophthalmic surgeon in Paris, France, warned about the underestimated risks associated with eyelash extensions. In an interview with Medscape's French edition, he expanded on these concerns, detailing complications ranging from conjunctivitis and allergic reactions to more serious conditions like keratitis and corneal ulcerations. 

Why did you decide to write an opinion piece warning about the dangers of eyelash extensions?

In my practice, I've seen several patients develop conjunctivitis after receiving eyelash extensions. These cosmetic procedures are increasingly promoted on social media, often promising a glamorous look and striking eyes with minimal effort. However, behind this pursuit of aesthetic enhancement lies a frequently underestimated risk to ocular health.

What are the risks associated with eyelash extensions?

Eyelashes serve to protect the eyes from external irritants. Extensions are applied to a particularly sensitive area and are not without risks. I'm seeing a growing number of patients presenting with dry eye, eyelid inflammation, conjunctivitis, allergic reactions to adhesives, or infections. Extensions also place added weight on the natural lashes, and over time, this repeated trauma can lead to lash loss. While regrowth may occur initially, it can eventually result in eyelash alopecia or misdirected regrowth, where lashes curve inward toward the eye rather than outward — causing significant discomfort.In more severe cases, complications such as keratitis or corneal ulcerations may develop.

What causes these complications?

The glues used to apply false lashes can be harmful. Some contain substances known to cause irritation and allergic reactions, such as formaldehyde or cyanoacrylates. Using these just millimeters from the cornea can trigger inflammation. Any eye injury is serious and can result in severe, even irreversible, complications. Application technique can also be an issue. Many beauty salons don't follow strict hygiene protocols and may spread bacteria like staphylococcus. There's often no requirement for technician training, so mistakes in handling extensions or improper disinfection of tools can occur.

What precautions should be taken by those considering eyelash extensions?

The reputation of the salon should be carefully checked. Staff should wear gloves and masks, disinfect their hands, and use sterilized, single-use tools. The procedure occurs very close to the eye, which is delicate, and must be performed correctly. Extensions should also be used sparingly. It's not about banning them, but common sense and moderation should take priority over beauty at all costs.

If the individual has a history of allergies, this should be discussed in advance with their primary care doctor or allergist. Some salons also use UV lamps to speed up glue curing, but UV exposure is harmful to health — for both the client and the technician. Salons using UV should be avoided. Finally, if after the procedure the person experiences discomfort or a sensation like sand in the eye, they should seek medical attention immediately.

Autoimmune diseases, especially in women, are associated with nearly a two-fold increased risk for affective disorders, new research showed.

An analysis of 1.5 million adults showed that the lifetime prevalence of self-reported diagnoses of depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety was 28.8% among individuals with an autoimmune condition vs 17.9% among those without an autoimmune condition (q < .001).

“Our results suggest that people with autoimmune conditions may have nearly double the risk of experiencing mental health issues compared to the general population. So regular mental health screenings in this patient group may be useful for prevention and early detection of mental health conditions,” study investigator Arish Mudra Rakshasa-Loots, MD, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, told Medscape Medical News.

However, he added, the study is observational in nature and direct inference of causal mechanisms cannot be made, so further research is necessary to translate these findings to the clinic, he added.

The study was published online on June 24 in BMJ Mental Health.

Chronic inflammation has been linked to several psychiatric disorders, raising the possibility that individuals with persistent inflammatory conditions may be at increased risk for mental health issues. To explore this hypothesis, researchers set out to investigate whether individual living with chronic inflammatory diseases experience higher rates of psychiatric symptoms compared to the general population.

For the study, investigators analyzed data from 1,563,155 million adults across the UK in the recently established, prospective Our Future Health cohort.

This study is the first to use data from the Our Future Health cohort, “which is already the world's largest consented cohort study, so we were able to analyze the relationship between inflammatory conditions and mental health issues with unprecedented precision,” Mudra Rakshasa-Loots said.

At baseline, participants provided demographic, health, and lifestyle information through an online questionnaire that included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7)-item Scale. Physical measurements and blood samples were also collected during a clinic visit. Their mean age was 53.2 years, 56.9% were women, and 90.2% self-identified as White individuals.

In the absence of direct measurements of inflammatory biomarkers, an autoimmune condition was considered an indirect indicator of chronic inflammation. Six autoimmune conditions were included in the analysis: rheumatoid arthritis, Graves' syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, multiple sclerosis, and psoriasis. Affective disorders were defined as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder.

In all, 37,808 individuals reported autoimmune conditions and 1,525,347 did not. Participants with an autoimmune condition were significantly more likely to be women (74.4% vs 56.5%), identify as White individuals (92.5% vs 90.1%), and to report lifetime diagnoses of affective disorders for their biological mothers (15.5% vs 10.6%) and fathers (7.6% vs 5.4%).

Individuals with any autoimmune disorder had a higher lifetime prevalence than the general population of depression (25.5% vs 15.2%), anxiety (21.2% vs 12.5%), and bipolar disorder (0.9% vs 0.5%; q < .001 for all).

In linear regression models, the risk for affective disorders was significantly higher among people with autoimmune conditions (odds ratio [OR], 1.86; 95% CI, 1.82-1.90) and remained high after controlling for age, sex, and ethnicity (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.71-1.79) and further controlling for household income, parental history of psychiatric illness, chronic pain experience, and degree of social isolation (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.44-1.52).

After adjusting for sociodemographic factors, the risk for depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder in those with autoimmune conditions was identical (OR, 1.49 for each).

The lifetime prevalence of affective disorders was significantly higher in each of the six autoimmune condition groups than in the general population.

Those with autoimmune conditions were also more likely to have current depression (18.6% vs 10.5%) and current anxiety (19.9% vs 12.9%), based on a PHQ-9 score ≥ 10 and a GAD-7 score ≥ 8, respectively.

The prevalence of affective disorders was significantly and consistently higher among women than among men with the same physical health conditions: 31.6% vs 20.7% with an autoimmune disorder and 21.9% vs 12.7% in the general population (q < .001 for both).

The authors noted the mechanisms underlying the higher prevalence are unclear, but theories suggest sex hormones, chromosomal factors, and differences in circulating antibodies may partly explain the differences.

There also may be sex differences in inflammatory biomarkers, with a recent meta-analysis reporting that the levels of C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 are elevated only among women with depression compared to healthy controls.

“It is therefore possible that women may experience the compounding challenges of increased occurrence of autoimmunity and stronger effects of immune responses on mental health, resulting in the substantially higher prevalence of affective disorders in this study,” they wrote.

Limitations include self-reported diagnoses of physical and mental health conditions, a lack of information on the time or duration of illness, and no direct measurements of inflammation.

“A critical next step will be to use blood-based biomarkers of inflammation as objective measures to test for associations between chronic inflammation and mental health risk in people with autoimmune conditions,” Mudra Rakshasa-Loots said. “We also hope to see longitudinal research that can provide insights into whether chronic inflammation precedes mental health conditions in this group, or vice versa.”

Commenting on the study, Charles B. Nemeroff, MD, PhD, professor and chair, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral sciences, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, said there is increasing evidence of a role for inflammation in the pathophysiology of depression and related mood disorders.

“Previous studies have sought to determine whether patients with autoimmune disorders, by definition associated with an increase in inflammation, have higher rates of depression but these studies were largely underpowered,” he told Medscape Medical News. “This large study confirms and extends those findings.”

Nemeroff agreed it would have been helpful to have some idea of treatment response and measurement of inflammatory markers in the cohort. Moreover, autoimmune conditions such as Hashimoto thyroiditis, Crohn's disease, and many others were not included.

He added that many unanswered questions remain. “How such patients respond to treatment is the question of paramount importance,” he said. “Do they require anti-inflammatory treatment? Do they respond as well to conventional evidence-based pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy?”

Mudra Rakshasa-Loots and coauthor Daniel J. Smith were supported by funding from the UK Medical Research Council. The authors and Nemeroff reported no competing interests.

DISCLOSURES |  July 01, 2025  

Compared with standard intensive speech and language therapy (iSLT) alone, right-sided cervical C7 neurotomy combined with iSLT significantly improved language function in patients with chronic aphasia after left hemisphere stroke in a randomized controlled trial conducted in China.

Compared with patients who received iSLT alone, patients who received the combined treatment showed statistically significant improvements across all measured outcomes, including naming ability, functional language scores, quality of life, and post-stroke depression, with no severe adverse events.

The results of the study, with first author Juntao Feng, MD, PhD, Fudan University, Shanghai, China, were published online on June 25 in The BMJ.

Chronic aphasia affects more than 60% of stroke survivors beyond the first year, impairing communication and reducing independence. While iSLT remains the standard intervention, its effect is often modest and no adjunct treatment has consistently delivered sustained benefit.

Recent anecdotal findings from C7 nerve transfer surgeries for spastic arm paralysis have hinted at coincidental improvements in language, particularly naming, prompting exploration of targeted neurotomy for chronic aphasia treatment.

Feng and colleagues enrolled 50 patients, aged 40-65 years, with aphasia for more than 1 year after a stroke affecting the left side of the brain, which is responsible for language. Most of the patients also had coexisting spasticity of the right arm.

Half were randomized to right C7 neurotomy at the intervertebral foramen followed by 3 weeks of iSLT and half to iSLT alone.

The primary endpoint was change on the 60-item Boston Naming Test (BNT, scores 0-60, with higher scores indicating better naming ability). BNT assessments occurred at baseline, 3 days, 1 month, and 6 months.

At 1 month, the average increase in BNT score was 11.16 points in the neurotomy plus iSLT group vs 2.72 points in the iSLT-only group — a significant 8.51-point difference (P < .001).

The difference favoring neurotomy add-on remained robust at 6 months (8.26-point difference; P < .001).

Of note, improvement in naming deficits — which are among the most resistant to therapy — were detectable within 3 days after surgery, before iSLT started, suggesting an immediate neuromodulatory effect of the neurotomy itself, the researchers said.

“It could be speculated that neurotomy of the seventh cervical nerve triggered changes in plasticity of the brain regions responsible for language,” they wrote.

Neurotomy was also associated with significant improvement in aphasia severity (difference at 1 month of 7.06 points on the aphasia quotient; P < .001), as well as patient-reported activity of daily life and post-stroke depression.

No major complications or long-term adverse effects were reported. Adverse events that were related to C7 neurotomy included transient neuropathic pain, decreased sensory and motor function in the right upper limb, and minor blood pressure elevations occurred in some patients, but resolved within 2 months post-surgery. No adverse events were noted at 6-month follow-up.

The investigators noted that the study population was limited to relatively young Mandarin-speaking Chinese patients treated at four urban centers, raising questions about generalizability. Additionally, follow-up was limited to 6 months.

The study team plans to follow the participants for 5 years and explore applicability in broader, international cohorts.

Based on their results, they concluded that right C7 neurotomy at the intervertebral foramen plus iSLT is “superior” to iSLT alone for chronic post-stroke aphasia and “could be considered an evidence-based intervention for patients aged 40-65 years with aphasia for more than 1 year after stroke.”

Commenting on the study for Medscape Medical News, Larry B. Goldstein, MD, chair of the Department of Neurology and codirector of the Kentucky Neuroscience Institute at the University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, called the study results “interesting and provocative.” 

“Caveats are that the participants were predominately men (80%), young (about 52 years; much younger than most stroke patients), and a high proportion had brain hemorrhages (about half; in general only 15% of strokes are from bleeding),” Goldstein noted.

“The participants' primary language was Chinese, and there was no control for medications they might have been receiving that could affect brain function. Additionally, both the participants and the therapists were aware of the treatment group (although the assessors were unaware of group assignment),” Goldstein pointed out.

“With those limitations in mind, the reported data suggests the potential viability of the approach. It will need to be assessed in a more typical population of patients (ie, older, a higher proportion of women, a higher proportion of ischemic stroke), account for medication use, blind therapists to treatment group, and involve participants speaking other languages,” Goldstein told Medscape Medical News.

The author of a linked editorial said the study is “an interesting step forward with room to explore further.” 

“Although intensive SLT remains the cornerstone of aphasia treatment, C7 neurotomy could become a potential adjunctive option for carefully selected individuals in the future,” wrote Supattana Chatromyen, MD, with the Neurological Institute of Thailand, Bangkok, Thailand.

“This research should spark further scientific research and a critical re-evaluation of rehabilitation paradigms and policies for chronic stroke care, fostering a more optimistic and proactive approach to long-term recovery,” Chatromyen concluded.

This study had no commercial funding. Feng, Goldstein, and Chatromyen had no relevant conflicts of interest.

The prevalence of alcohol use and binge drinking declined among adolescents, but those with a recent history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) showed more modest declines.

“[These] findings suggest the need for continued screening and assessment of substance misuse among adolescents presenting with STBs, as well as the importance of developing targeted treatments to address these co-occurring concerns,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Shayna M. Cheek, PhD, of the Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina. It was published online on June 21 in the Journal of Adolescent Health.

The true prevalence rates of substance use may have been underestimated because the survey was conducted in schools, and STBs and substance use are linked to absenteeism. The timing of survey administration in 2021 was inconsistent because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic factors such as gender identity or poverty were not assessed. 

This study did not receive any specific funding. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

Patients diagnosed with central precocious puberty (CPP) — a condition in which physical changes related to pubertal development occur earlier than usual — had a nearly 50% elevated risk of developing psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, and the incidence of both depression and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remained persistently elevated for years after diagnosis.

""Caretakers of patients with CPP should actively explore psychological symptoms and facilitate early intervention to influence lifetime trajectories of this vulnerable patient population positively. Because our findings indicate long-term sequelae of CPP on mental health, caretakers should be vigilant even after normalization of pubertal development,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Lars Dinkelbach, MD, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany. It was published online on June 23, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

This study relied on physician-reported diagnoses in a population-based setting and on routine health insurance data, which limited its ability to control for confounding variables. The precision of age-related analyses reduced due to data-anonymity policies of the insurance data. The small number of cases with self-harming behaviours or substance use disorders limited the ability to conclude any association.

DISCLOSURES |  July 01, 2025  

The relationship between psoriasis and psychosocial symptoms tends to be a cyclical one. Psychological stressors can exacerbate the disease through overactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conversely, the cutaneous inflammatory response can cause body disfigurement, stigmatization, and ultimately anxiety and depression.

What do you know about the psychosocial burden of psoriasis? Test your knowledge with this quick quiz.

As patients with psoriasis experience a relapsing course, over time they often face a lower quality of life owing to their symptoms, social stigmas, and impacted self-esteem. For example, a review that evaluated the psychological comorbidities associated with this condition reported that patients with psoriasis who have visible psoriatic lesions face a significant negative impact on their quality of life. Further, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) scores can be influenced by both lesion location and severity; increased Psoriasis Area and Severity Index scores have been linked to higher DLQI scores as well, which indicates that ""as disease severity worsens, so does the overall impact on quality of life."" Patients can experience any form of psychological and social distress as a result, not just anxiety.

Although depression in psoriasis is common, the psychosocial impact of the disease has not been mainly linked with fear of developing psoriatic arthritis.

In patients with psoriasis, female sex has been identified as a risk factor for depression in this population. A systematic review exploring the burden of depression in psoriasis reported a higher overall prevalence of depression in females over males. This is consistent with other recent data; however, male patients with psoriasis still seem to have an increased prevalence of depression compared with males without psoriasis. Ultimately, current data point to the fact that the prevalence of depression is higher among all patients with psoriasis, but female patients with skin disease appear to be at greater risk than their male counterparts.

Younger age is more frequently associated with depression, though older individuals with psoriasis can still be affected.

Pruritus is one of the main symptoms of plaque psoriasis. Although it varies in intensity, this symptom should not be disregarded owing to its significant impact on mental health. Anxiety and depression are linked to plaque psoriasis; these psychological comorbidities can increase the frequency and severity of pruritus, which results in an increased tendency to scratch; conversely, the increased pruritus and scratching also worsens anxiety and depression.

It is estimated that 40% of patients with plaque psoriasis experience nail involvement. Further, nail involvement has been linked to ""significant psychological distress, including anxiety and depression.""

Though any severity of skin pain can be linked to psychosocial burden in patients with chronic dermatological disorders such as plaque psoriasis, data have shown that patient-reported skin pain is usually of ""moderate intensity"" when HRQOL is negatively affected.

Learn more about the signs and symptoms of plaque psoriasis.

Psychosocial interventions have been shown to improve DLQI scores in patients with psoriasis. Specifically, the addition of mindfulness therapy to treatment as usual for psoriasis has been found to improve DLQI the most compared with other studied interventions (treatment as usual alone, psoriasis and lifestyle education, and online-based management). Cognitive-behavioral therapy in conjunction with pharmacological therapy has also been shown to improve psychosocial and disease-related symptoms. This result is most likely owing to stress as an identified trigger for psoriasis flares and decreased DLQI scores, with mindfulness therapy aiming to reduce stress and therefore flares.

This is consistent with another recent review finding improvement in both disease severity and DLQI scores with various forms of mindfulness intervention. However, cognitive-behavioral therapy and treatment as usual were most effective for the other outcome measures, including anxiety, depression, and treatment adherence; mindfulness therapy was the least effective intervention for adherence. Education regarding psoriasis and lifestyle management that can help with symptoms was shown to improve HRQOL.

Biologic therapy has been shown to effectively treat depression symptoms in the setting of psoriasis. Other therapeutic approaches that are effective for depression symptoms in psoriasis were conventional systemic therapy and phototherapy. Taken together, evidence supports the theory that improved skin disease is associated with improved psychiatric disease.

Patients with psoriasis have a higher prevalence of hypertension. Beta-blockers in this setting can worsen psoriasis, which can negatively affect depression symptoms. Overall, evidence of a link between depression symptoms and beta-blocker use is mixed.

Some psychotropic medications can cause flares in skin disease, including lithium, fluoxetine, and bupropion; these agents should therefore be prescribed with caution in this population. Similarly, the link between depression symptoms and psychotropic medication use is inconsistent.

Though certain phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors can improve psoriasis symptoms and can improve quality of life, data indicate that they can worsen depression symptoms.

A series of retrospective studies reported that women treated with low-dose oral minoxidil (LDOM) experience orthostatic symptoms more frequently than men, despite normal blood pressure (BP) readings.

“Presence of hypotensive symptoms without measurable hypotension raises the possibility that symptom perception or anxiety-related responses to cardiovascular sensations may influence tolerability, especially in women,” the study authors wrote. “Further research is warranted to explore the physiologic and psychologic mechanisms underlying these sex-based differences, which could inform more personalized dosing and monitoring strategies,” they added.

The study was conducted by Michael M. Ong, BS, Weill Cornell Medicine, and Shari Lipner, MD, Department of Dermatology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York City, and was published online on June 26 in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.

The reliance solely on BP measurements may not fully capture the range of vascular sensitivity experienced by patients.

The study received no funding. Lipner disclosed serving as a consultant for Moberg Pharma and BelleTorus Corporation.

At the recent 44th Health Economics Association Conference in Madrid, Spain, researchers presented compelling evidence that traumatic experiences in childhood have long-lasting effects on both health and wealth in adulthood. The study revealed that individuals who faced early life adversity reported a 1.4% increase in chronic conditions and a 1.1-point increase in mobility limitation. While their self-perceived physical health showed no significant effects, mental health declined by 1%, and net worth dropped by 8%.

These findings were presented by Jaime Pinilla, PhD in Economics, professor in the Department of Quantitative Methods for Economics and Management at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (ULPGC), Las Palmas, Spain, and Alexandrina Stoyanova, PhD in Economics (2004), professor of Economics at the University of Barcelona School of Economics, Barcelona, Spain.

The research, conducted as part of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) project, also involved Miguel Ángel Negrín, PhD, professor of Econometrics and Statistics at the ULPGC, and Rosa María Urbanos Garrido, PhD, professor of Applied Economics at the Complutense University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain.

The study analysed 86,212 observations from 13,924 individuals aged 50 years and older, including 8039 participants (9.32%) from Spain.

Pinilla explained that SHARE is a longitudinal study that tracks individuals over time to explore how childhood experiences affect physical, mental, and socioeconomic health in old age. “We aimed to identify correlations between those circumstances and current health status, defining those events as traumatic events,” he said.

Traumatic childhood experiences included living without basic amenities such as an indoor bathroom or running water, in overcrowded homes, or outside the family unit.

“We also considered more severe experiences — such as growing up in psychiatric hospitals, labour camps, or other institutions — not necessarily due to personal problems but often as a result of challenging conditions within the family environment,” noted Pinilla.

“We found that those who have suffered childhood trauma experience greater chronicity, poorer mental health, and more functional limitations in adulthood,” Pinilla emphasised.

The data showed that childhood hunger was linked to a 15.8% increase in chronic illnesses and a 25% decline in mental health.

The economic impact was also significant in this study. Pinilla noted, “We observed a 31.7% reduction in the net worth of individuals who experienced hunger during childhood,”

The research team argued that these findings highlight the need for preventive social intervention. “The goal is to focus on individuals who have lived through such circumstances, to prevent these disadvantages from accumulating or worsening in adulthood,” they concluded.

The study was funded by the Ministry of Science and Innovation, the Agència de Gestió d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca, and the European Union.

A prospective cohort study led by Yang Shao, PhD, president and CEO of Geneseeq Technology Inc. and professor at Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, published in Nature Medicine, on a blood test capable of simultaneously detecting 13 types of cancer. The test demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity and was able to identify early-stage cancers that often go unnoticed during routine screenings.

Traditional cancer screening methods are often invasive, expensive, and time-consuming, which can reduce patient adherence. In addition, several cancers — such as pancreatic cancer — are typically asymptomatic in their early stages and progress rapidly, with no established screening protocols currently available.

This prompted the development of less invasive approaches, such as multi-cancer early detection (MCED) blood tests that can detect a cancer signal from circulating cell-free DNA. These simple blood tests analyze plasma cell-free DNA using genetic and fragmentomic-based features from whole genome sequencing to simultaneously detect multiple cancer types. Although promising, current MCED tests still have relatively low sensitivity, typically less than 60%. Experts, including those from the American Cancer Society, cautioned that widespread use could create a false sense of reassurance and potentially deter patients from following up with standard screenings.

Researchers have developed an MCED blood test that detects 13 cancers: breast, cervical, colorectal, endometrial, esophageal, gastric, liver, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, biliary tract, and lymphoma. These cancers account for 66.6% of all new cases and 74% of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The test uses two main classifiers: the detection-of-cancer classifier, tasked with confirming the presence of cancer, and the tissue-of-origin classifier, responsible for pinpointing the primary site of malignancy by analyzing and integrating feature frameworks, including copy number variations, fragment size coverage, fragment size distribution, nucleosome footprint, and fragment-based methylation.

To develop the test, researchers analyzed 6553 blood samples, 3076 from patients with cancer and 3477 from healthy individuals, divided into a training dataset of 4807 samples and an internal validation dataset of 1746 samples.

Independent validation was performed using a prospectively enrolled cohort of 1465 participants in an age-matched fashion, comprising 732 patients with cancer and 733 non-cancer individuals between April and November 2021. In the third ongoing phase, 3724 asymptomatic adults aged 45-75 years in the Jinling cohort underwent both complete physical examinations and the MCED test in June 2023.

In independent validation, the MCED test showed an overall sensitivity of 87.4% and specificity of 97.8%. The sensitivity was particularly high for certain cancer types, such as 100% for liver and biliary tract cancer, 94.5% for lung cancer, and 82.3% for colorectal cancer. Even cancers that are difficult to diagnose early, such as pancreatic and ovarian cancers, showed a sensitivity of 76.9% for pancreatic cancer and 90.5% for ovarian cancer. Breast cancer had the lowest sensitivity at 63.8%.

The test was effective in detecting early-stage disease, with a sensitivity of 79.3% for stage I and 86.9% for stage II cancer. This increased to 92.4% for stage III and 97.1% for stage IV. When considering the top two tissue origin predictions, the accuracy increased to 90.7% for the internal set and 91.7% for the independent set. It performed best in identifying cancers of the colon-rectum, lungs, and liver but was less accurate for pancreatic and stomach cancers, correctly identifying the origin in 50% or fewer cases.

In a prospective screening cohort of asymptomatic individuals, the MCED test identified 23 of 43 cancer cases within 1 year, with an overall sensitivity of 53.5%. When limited to the 13 cancers that the test was designed to detect, the sensitivity increased to 62.1%. Most of these cases (93%) were early-stage cancers (stage 0, I, or II). The specificity remained high at 98.1%, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 25% and a negative predictive value of 99.4%.

Notably, 8 of the 23 positive patients who received a positive MCED result had their cancers undetected through physical examination, and 4 had cancers for which there is currently no recommended screening, highlighting the potential of the MCED test to effectively detect cancers that would otherwise have gone undetected.

“Our study demonstrated high sensitivity, highlighting our classifier's ability to detect cancer cases, even in populations with lower disease prevalence. This underscores the capacity of our classifier to effectively detect incident cancer cases under real-world screening conditions, facilitated by comprehensive physical examinations,” the authors concluded.

These findings suggest that the MCED test could be a valuable complement to existing screening methods, particularly for cancers without routine early detection tools. The ability to detect early-stage pancreatic and ovarian cancers is particularly promising. However, broader validation across diverse populations, cost-effectiveness analyses, and studies on the psychological impact of screening outcomes are critical before widespread clinical implementation.

One key limitation was that the PPV achieved was 25% for the MCED test, which was lower than the 38% reported in the PATHFINDER study published in 2023.

“The PATHFINDER trial enrolled participants with a higher cancer prevalence and utilized the MCED test results to trigger diagnostic workup, systematically investigating participants with positive test results, thus inherently enriching their cohort for cancer diagnoses within the workup pathway. Conversely, the Jinling study adopted a standardized comprehensive physical examination for all participants as the primary screening modality, independent of MCED test outcomes and within the context of lower cancer prevalence,” the researchers noted.

However, the absolute number of false positives in the Jinling study was low (20 of 3724 participants, or 0.54%). False-positive results can lead to unnecessary anxiety, further invasive diagnostic procedures, and potentially inappropriate treatment for patients. The researchers emphasized the need to improve the sensitivity of the MCED test for very early-stage cancers while reducing false positives.

Prescribing stimulants for teens and adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) via telehealth was not associated with increased risk for substance use disorder (SUD) compared with in-person prescribing, a new study suggested. However, receiving an initial stimulant prescription via telehealth was linked to a sixfold higher risk for stimulant use disorder (stimUD).

“Our study suggests that, generally, telehealth-based relationships — which make healthcare more accessible — can be safe and don't increase the risk of substance use disorder,” lead study investigator Vinod Rao, MD, PhD, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, said in a press release.

However, the findings, “particularly for stimUD, require replication in other healthcare settings,” the investigators wrote.

This study was published online on June 11 in The American Journal of Psychiatry.

Limitations included a reliance on administrative claims data, which captured filled prescriptions but not actual medication use, potentially introducing exposure misclassification. Diagnoses of SUDs were according to coded claims rather than clinical assessments, which may have led to underreporting or misclassification. The analysis was also limited to commercially insured participants, reducing the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, race and ethnicity data were incomplete, and long-term outcomes beyond 12 months were not assessed.

This study was funded by research awards from the FDA and the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Two investigators reported receiving research funding from the National Institutes of Health and private foundations, receiving support for clinical program development from regional health organizations and foundations, holding consultancy or editorial roles with government, nonprofit, and academic entities, or having intellectual property interests related to pharmaceutical and digital therapeutics collaborations. The other five investigators reported no relevant financial relationships.

A new study from scientists at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging has revealed a surprising player in the battle against Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia: brain sugar metabolism. Published in Nature Metabolism, the research uncovers how breaking down glycogen-a stored form of glucose-in neurons may protect the brain from toxic protein buildup and degeneration.

Glycogen is typically thought of as a reserve energy source stored in the liver and muscles. While small amounts also exist in the brain, particularly in support cells called astrocytes, its role in neurons has long been dismissed as negligible.

This new study challenges that view, and it does so with striking implications. Stored glycogen doesn't just sit there in the brain; it is involved in pathology.""

Professor Pankaj Kapahi, PhD, senior scientist on the study

The research team, led by postdoc Sudipta Bar, PhD, discovered that in both fly and human models of tauopathy (a group of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's), neurons accumulate excessive glycogen. More importantly, this buildup appears to contribute to disease progression. Bar says tau, the infamous protein that clumps into tangles in Alzheimer's patients, appears to physically bind to glycogen, trapping it and preventing its breakdown.

When glycogen can't be broken down, the neurons lose an essential mechanism for managing oxidative stress, a key feature in aging and neurodegeneration. By restoring the activity of an enzyme called glycogen phosphorylase (GlyP)-which kicks off the process of glycogen breakdown-the researchers found they could reduce tau-related damage in fruit flies and human stem cell-derived neurons.

Rather than using glycogen as a fuel for energy production, these enzyme-supported neurons rerouted the sugar molecules into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)-a critical route for generating NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and Glutathione, molecules that protect against oxidative stress. ""By increasing GlyP activity, the brain cells could better detoxify harmful reactive oxygen species, thereby reducing damage and even extending the lifespan of tauopathy model flies,"" said Bar.

Even more promising, the team demonstrated that dietary restriction (DR)-a well-known intervention to extend lifespan-naturally enhanced GlyP activity and improved tau-related outcomes in flies. They further mimicked these effects pharmacologically using a molecule called 8-Br-cAMP, showing that the benefits of DR might be reproduced through drug-based activation of this sugar-clearing system. ""This work could explain why GLP-1 drugs, now widely used for weight loss, show promise against dementia, potentially by mimicking dietary restriction,"" said Kapahi.

Researchers also confirmed similar glycogen accumulation and protective effects of GlyP in human neurons derived from patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), strengthening the potential for translational therapies. Kapahi says the study emphasizes the power of the fly as a model system in uncovering how metabolic dysregulation impacts neurodegeneration. ""Work in this simple animal allowed us to move into human neurons in a much more targeted way,"" he said.

Kapahi also acknowledges the Buck's highly collaborative atmosphere as a major factor in the work. His lab, with expertise in fly aging and neurodegeneration, took advantage of proteomics expertise in the Schilling lab and the Seyfried lab (at Emory University) as well as the Ellerby lab which has expertise in human iPSCs and neurodegeneration. 

Kapahi says this study not only highlights glycogen metabolism as an unexpected hero in the brain but also opens up a new direction in the search for treatments against Alzheimer's and related diseases. ""By discovering how neurons manage sugar, we may have unearthed a novel therapeutic strategy: one that targets the cell's inner chemistry to fight age-related decline,"" he says. ""As we continue to age as a society, findings like these offer hope that better understanding-and perhaps rebalancing-our brain's hidden sugar code could unlock powerful tools for combating dementia"".

A new study from UCLA Health has uncovered how inflammation in brain blood vessels exacerbates damage in vascular dementia and demonstrated that targeting this process with a repurposed drug can promote brain repair and functional recovery in mice.

Published in Cell, the research combines laboratory and human data to pinpoint a critical signaling pathway that could lead to the first effective treatment for this understudied form of dementia.

Vascular dementia is the second leading cause of dementia. This disease co-occurs with Alzheimer's disease in the leading cause of dementia, termed ""mixed dementia."" There is no drug therapy that promotes recovery in vascular dementia. A key problem in this disease is that the brain damage expands from initial areas, to become larger over time. The UCLA team sought to identify what happens in the brain in these areas of expansion. To do this, the researchers identified all the molecules that communicate among the cells of the brain adjacent to the dementia lesions, and which ones are abnormally up or down in the disease compared to normal brain. By doing this both in laboratory models of vascular dementia and in human brain, the UCLA team was able to precisely identify the ""interactome"" in vascular dementia - all the molecules that signal or interact in the cells at risk.

We reasoned that the cell in the brain areas in which the disease expands will lose their normal signaling with each other. In other words, the cell-to-cell interaction is disturbed in a toxic way in vascular dementia. We set out to identify these cell-to-cell interactions or the ""interactome"" in vascular dementia."" 

Dr. S. Thomas Carmichael, study's lead author and professor and chair Neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA

One molecular system jumped out as potentially significant. This system communicates between blood vessel cells and adjacent brain inflammatory cells, termed microglia. In vascular dementia, the CD39 (an enzyme) and the adenosine A3 receptor (A3AR) are downregulated together in these two cell types, synergistically by aging and vessel ischemic lesion. Because vascular dementia is a disease of aging, this double finding - a downregulation with both disease and aging - signaled a possibly significant role. CD39 generates through several steps the molecule adenosine, which binds to A3AR, and modifies inflammation, downregulating some of its harmful effects. 

To test this CD39/A3AR system as a possible drug target for treating vascular dementia, the group utilized a drug that is in clinical trials for psoriasis. When given to mice in a model of vascular dementia, this drug promoted repair of brain tissue and recovery of memory and gait functions.

""The most exciting finding was that delayed intervention still worked,"" said lead author Dr. Min Tian, a postdoctoral scholar at UCLA Health. ""This is crucial because vascular dementia is often diagnosed late. By targeting the crosstalk between blood vessels and brain cells, we're addressing the root cause of damage, not just masking symptoms.""

While the results are promising, further studies are needed before human trials can begin. The team is now optimizing dosing and exploring biomarkers to track the therapy's effectiveness.

The study, ""Deconstructing the Intercellular Interactome in Vascular Dementia with Focal Ischemia for Therapeutic Applications,"" will be online in Cell, June 30, 2025, and includes collaborators from UCLA's neurology, pathology, neurobiology, physiology and psychiatry departments. Funding was provided by the National Institutes of Health, Ressler Family Foundation, The Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G. Adelson Medical Research Foundation, UCLA Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research, including support from the Steffy Family Trust.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative condition that affects a significant proportion of older people worldwide. Synapses are points of communication between neural cells that are malleable to change based on our experiences. By adding, removing, strengthening, or weakening synaptic contacts, our brain encodes new events or forgets previous ones. In AD, synaptic plasticity, the brain's ability to regulate the strength of synaptic connections between neurons, is significantly disrupted. This worsens over time, reducing cognitive and memory functions leading to reduced quality of life. To date, there is no effective cure for AD, and only limited treatments for managing the symptoms.

Studies have shown that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that uses electromagnetic pulses to target specific brain regions, has therapeutic potential to manage dementia and related diseases. From previous studies, we know that rTMS can promote synaptic plasticity in healthy nervous systems. Moreover, it is already used to treat certain neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions. However, individual responses to rTMS for AD management are variable, and the underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood.

Recently, researchers from the University of Queensland (Australia) and the Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre at the University of Tasmania investigated the effects of rTMS on synapses in the brain cortex of mice with Alzheimer's type dementia. Their report is published in Neurophotonics. ""Since synaptic dysfunction is a key mechanism in AD, in this study, we quantified the changes in synaptic axonal boutons in AD mouse model in response to rTMS, comparing them to those in healthy mice,"" explains corresponding author Dr. Barbora Fulopova, a professor at University of Queensland.

Axonal boutons are specialized endings of an axon, which is the long slender part of a neuron that connects neurons by transmitting neural signals. These are sites where synapses form, allowing neurons to communicate. Therefore, any change in the number or function of these boutons can have profound effects on brain connectivity. In this study, the researchers observed structural changes of two types of excitatory boutons, namely ""terminaux boutons"" (TBs) (short protrusions from the axon shaft typically connecting neurons in a local area) and ""en passant boutons"" (EPBs) (small bead-like structures along axons typically connecting distal regions). They used two-photon imaging to visualize individual axons and synapses in the brain of a live animal.

The study was conducted on the APP/PS1 xThy-1GFP-M strain of mice, which is a cross between the APP/PS1 strain (genetically modified to show AD-like symptoms seen in humans) and the Thy1-GFP-M strain, which expresses a fluorescent protein in certain neurons. This combination causes axons to glow during imaging, enabling precise tracking of synaptic bouton changes over time. The team monitored the dynamics of the axonal boutons in these mice at 48-hour intervals for eight days, both before and after a single rTMS session. They then compared these findings to healthy wild-type (WT) mice.

They found that both TBs and EPBs in the AD mouse model had comparable density to those in healthy WT mice. However, the turnover of both bouton types was significantly lower in the AD mouse model before rTMS, likely due to the amyloid plaque buildup, a key marker of dementia, and potentially causing diseases like AD. After a single session of low-intensity rTMS, the turnover of TBs in both strains increased significantly, while there was no change in the EPB turnover. Notably, the largest changes were observed two days after stimulation with an 88 percent increase in TB turnover for the WT strain and a 213 percent increase in the APP-GFP strain. However, this increase returned to pre-stimulation levels by the eighth day.

Furthermore, in the AD mouse model, this increased turnover was comparable to the turnover levels in the WT mice seen before stimulation. This indicates that low-intensity rTMS can potentially restore the synaptic plasticity of TBs to those seen in healthy mice. Moreover, the fact that only TBs, and not EPBs, responded to rTMS points to the possibility that the mechanisms of rTMS might be cell-type specific.

This is the first study to provide evidence of pre-synaptic boutons responding to rTMS in a healthy nervous system as well as a nervous system marked by the presence of dementia. Given the established link between synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline in dementia and the use of rTMS for the treatment of other neurodegenerative conditions, our findings highlight its potential as a powerful addition to currently used AD management strategies.""

Dr. Barbora Fulopova, Professor at University of Queensland

This study marks a significant step forward in understanding AD. While further research is required, the findings of this study pave the way for targeted rTMS treatments that could improve the quality of life of patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Researchers at Tohoku University have discovered that an oral drug called MA-5 can improve both heart and muscle problems in Barth syndrome, a rare genetic disorder affecting 1 in 300,000 births worldwide with no current cure.

Barth syndrome is caused by mutations in the TAZ gene that leave patients—mostly young boys—with weakened hearts, muscle fatigue, and increased rates of infection. Many require heart transplants, and current treatments only manage symptoms without addressing the underlying cause.

The research team, led by Professors Takaaki Abe, and Takafumi Toyohara, and first author Yoshiyasu Tongu, tested MA-5 on cells from four Barth syndrome patients and in fruit fly (Drosophila) models of the disease. Published in The FASEB Journal on June 21, 2025, their findings reveal that MA-5 boosted cellular energy (ATP) production by up to 50% and protected cells from oxidative stress-induced death.

What excites us most is that MA-5 works by targeting the fundamental problem in Barth syndrome—defective energy production in mitochondria. Unlike current treatments that only manage symptoms, MA-5 actually improves the root cause of how cells generate energy.""

Professor Takaaki Abe

MA-5 was chosen as a treatment because it enhances interactions between two crucial mitochondrial proteins—mitofilin and ATP synthase—leading to more efficient energy production. As such, this mechanism directly addresses the cause of cellular dysfunction in Barth syndrome.

In human muscle cells derived from Barth syndrome iPS cell models, MA-5 corrected abnormal mitochondrial structures and reduced cellular stress markers. When tested in Drosophila with Barth syndrome, the drug dramatically improved their climbing ability (capacity for physical exertion) and normalized their elevated heart rates—two key symptoms that mirror how the disease affects humans. Furthermore, MA-5 restored normal mitochondrial structure in the Drosophila muscle tissue.

These promising results suggest that MA-5 addresses the largest challenges faced by patients with Barth syndrome, which would significantly improve their quality of life. Phase I clinical trials in Japan have been completed successfully, and the research team is preparing to start Phase II trials soon.

""We've validated MA-5 using patient cells, iPS cell models and a Drosophila model of Barth syndrome,"" remarks Abe. ""The evidence from all of these studies supports its potential effectiveness in patients with Barth syndrome, which we hope to examine more in the next clinical trial.""

Considering the limited options for treatment currently available, this research provides hope for a better future for patients and their families. Critically, MA-5 can be taken orally, which makes administration significantly easier for pediatric patients. It is the first oral medication for Barth syndrome to progress to the clinical trial stage.

The team's findings suggest that MA-5 could become the first disease-modifying treatment for Barth syndrome, offering new therapeutic options beyond current symptomatic management.

The research was supported by grants from JSPS KAKENHI, AMED, and other Japanese research foundations.

In radiation therapy, precision can save lives. Oncologists must carefully map the size and location of a tumor before delivering high-dose radiation to destroy cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue. But this process, called tumor segmentation, is still done manually, takes time, varies between doctors - and can lead to critical tumor areas being overlooked.

Now, a team of Northwestern Medicine scientists has developed an AI tool called iSeg that not only matches doctors in accurately outlining lung tumors on CT scans but can also identify areas that some doctors may miss, reports a large new study.

Unlike earlier AI tools that focused on static images, iSeg is the first 3D deep learning tool shown to segment tumors as they move with each breath - a critical factor in planning radiation treatment, which half of all cancer patients in the U.S. receive during their illness.

We're one step closer to cancer treatments that are even more precise than any of us imagined just a decade ago.""

Dr. Mohamed Abazeed, senior author, chair and professor of radiation oncology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine

""The goal of this technology is to give our doctors better tools,"" added Abazeed, who leads a research team developing data-driven tools to personalize and improve cancer treatment and is a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University.

The study will be published June 30 in the journal npj Precision Oncology.

The Northwestern scientists trained iSeg using CT scans and doctor-drawn tumor outlines from hundreds of lung cancer patients treated at nine clinics within the Northwestern Medicine and Cleveland Clinic health systems. That's far beyond the small, single-hospital datasets used in many past studies.

After training, the AI was tested on patient scans it hadn't seen before. Its tumor outlines were then compared to those drawn by physicians. The study found that iSeg consistently matched expert outlines across hospitals and scan types. It also flagged additional areas that some doctors missed - and those missed areas were linked to worse outcomes if left untreated. This suggests iSeg may help catch high-risk regions that often go unnoticed.

""Accurate tumor targeting is the foundation of safe and effective radiation therapy, where even small errors in targeting can impact tumor control or cause unnecessary toxicity,"" Abazeed said.

""By automating and standardizing tumor contouring, our AI tool can help reduce delays, ensure fairness across hospitals and potentially identify areas that doctors might miss - ultimately improving patient care and clinical outcomes,"" added first author Sagnik Sarkar, a senior research technologist at Feinberg who holds a Master of Science in artificial intelligence from Northwestern.

The research team is now testing iSeg in clinical settings, comparing its performance to physicians in real time. They are also integrating features like user feedback and working to expand the technology to other tumor types, such as liver, brain and prostate cancers. The team also plans to adapt iSeg to other imaging methods, including MRI and PET scans.

""We envision this as a foundational tool that could standardize and enhance how tumors are targeted in radiation oncology, especially in settings where access to subspecialty expertise is limited,"" said co- author Troy Teo, instructor of radiation oncology at Feinberg.

""This technology can help support more consistent care across institutions, and we believe clinical deployment could be possible within a couple of years,"" Teo added.

This study is titled ""Deep learning for automated, motion- resolved tumor segmentation in radiotherapy.""

The innate immune system is the body's first line of defense against pathogens and foreign substances. An essential component of this system are pattern recognition receptors, which recognize non-self RNA - such as that from viruses and bacteria - and trigger an immune response. A team of LMU researchers led by immunologist Professor Veit Hornung and chemist Professor Thomas Carell has now deciphered the molecular mechanism by which certain RNA modifications evade these receptors - a key mechanism for the development of RNA therapeutics and mRNA vaccines.

The main pattern recognition receptors for identifying foreign RNA are the Toll-like receptors TLR7 and TLR8, which are located in specific cell organelles called endolysosomes. However, the RNAs must first be broken down by certain enzymes in the endolysosomes before they can be recognized by the receptors - and this is why modified RNA is not recognized: ""We were able to show for the first time that modified RNA containing pseudouridine instead of uridine is less easily processed by lysosomal enzymes. At the same time, the receptors also fail to recognize the pseudouridine-containing fragments,"" explains Marleen Bérouti, co-first author of the study alongside Mirko Wagner.

Pseudouridine is a modification of cellular RNAs that is widespread in nature, particularly in vertebrate RNA. Back in 2005, a groundbreaking study showed that pseudouridine in synthetic mRNA greatly reduces the immune response. This knowledge formed the basis for the development of RNA therapeutics and mRNA vaccines. In certain mRNA vaccines against COVID-19, for example, a related modification called N1-methylpseudouridine was used, which, when incorporated into RNA, is also not recognized by the receptors. The mechanism identified by the researchers now explains mechanistically why modified mRNAs do not cause excessive inflammation, which is particularly important for the widespread application of this technology.

The authors are convinced that the new findings offer important starting points for the future targeted development of RNA-based drugs.

And, of course, it is also fundamentally important to understand why the body's own RNA is not recognized. We are currently investigating in detail the role pseudouridine plays in this process.""

Washington State University researchers have discovered how the bacteria that cause anaplasmosis and Lyme disease hijack cellular processes in ticks to ensure their survival and spread to new hosts, including humans.

Based in the College of Veterinary Medicine, the team found that the bacteria can manipulate a protein known as ATF6, which helps cells detect and respond to infection, to support its own growth and survival inside the tick. The findings, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could serve as a launching point for developing methods to eliminate the bacteria in ticks before they are transmitted to humans and other animals.

Most research has looked at how these bacteria interact with humans and animals and not how they survive and spread in ticks. What we have found could open the door to targeting these pathogens in ticks, before they are ever a threat to people.""

Kaylee Vosbigian, doctoral student and lead author on the study

Vosbigian and her advisor, Dana Shaw, the corresponding author of the study and an associate professor in the Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology, focused their research on Ixodes scapularis, also known as the blacklegged tick, which is responsible for spreading both Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agents of anaplasmosis and Lyme disease. Both diseases are becoming increasingly common and can cause serious illness in humans and animals.

The team discovered that when ATF6 is activated in tick cells, it triggers the production of stomatin, a protein that helps move cholesterol through cells as part of a normal cellular processes. The bacteria exploit this process against their tick hosts, using the cholesterol –which they need to grow and build their own cell membranes but cannot produce themselves – to support their own survival and success.

""Stomatin plays a variety of roles in the cell, but one of its key functions is helping shuttle cholesterol to different areas,"" Vosbigian said. ""The bacteria take advantage of this, essentially stealing the cholesterol they need to survive.""

When the researchers blocked the production of stomatin, restricting the availability of cholesterol, bacterial growth is significantly reduced. The researchers believe this shows targeting the ATF6-stomatin pathway could lead to new methods for interrupting the disease cycle in ticks before transmission occurs.

As part of the study, Vosbigian also developed a new research tool called ArthroQuest, a free, web-based platform hosted by WSU that allows scientists to search the genomes of ticks, mosquitoes, lice, sand flies, mites, fleas and other arthropod vectors for transcription factor binding sites – genetic switches like ATF6 that control gene activity.

""There aren't many tools out there for studying gene regulation in arthropods,"" Vosbigian said. ""Most are built for humans or model species like fruit flies, which are genetically very different from ticks.""

Using ArthroQuest, the team found that ATF6-regulated control of stomatin appears to be prevalent in blood-feeding arthropods. Since the hijacking of cholesterol and other lipids is common among arthropod-borne pathogens, the researchers suspect many may also exploit ATF6.

""We know many other vector-borne pathogens, like Borrelia burgdorferi and the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium, rely on cholesterol and other lipids from their hosts,"" Shaw said. ""So, the fact that this ATF6-stomatin pathway exists in other arthropods could be relevant to a wide range of disease systems.""

The research was supported in part by a National Institutes of Health R01 grant and a College of Veterinary Medicine intramural seed grant.

Today, a new ESC Clinical Consensus Statement published in the European Heart Journal discusses the key role of vaccination in preventing cardiovascular events following various viral and bacterial infections.

We have known for many years that influenza can increase the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and can exacerbate heart failure. More recently, evidence suggests that other respiratory infections are also associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The new publication describes how vaccinations not only prevent infections but also reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, particularly in susceptible individuals.""

 Professor Thomas F. Lüscher, ESC President and senior author of the ESC Clinical Consensus Statement

The ESC Clinical Consensus Statement describes data on the risk of cardiovascular complications following infections such as pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus, among others, and describes the inflammatory mechanisms that may be responsible. Evidence is then summarised for the beneficial effects of vaccines in reducing cardiovascular events following various viral and bacterial infections, particularly in at-risk patient groups. Clinical practice guidelines from the ESC and from the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) are presented, which advocate for vaccination against influenza and other widespread infections in patients with chronic coronary syndromes (including coronary artery disease) and in those with heart failure.

Serious adverse reactions to vaccinations are very rare. The consensus statement also discusses the risks of cardiovascular adverse events after vaccination, such as myocarditis, and describes appropriate management strategies. Then follows advice on which vaccines should be given to patients with cardiovascular diseases and how often. Vaccination of pregnant women and other vulnerable patient groups, such as those with congenital heart disease and heart transplantation, is considered.

Professor Lüscher concluded: ""Prevention is crucial for reducing the considerable burden of cardiovascular disease. The totality of the evidence indicates that vaccinations should become a foundational pillar of preventive strategies alongside other established measures.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Caltech researchers develop safer and smarter breast imaging technique","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250630/Caltech-researchers-develop-safer-and-smarter-breast-imaging-technique.aspx","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 03:54:00 GMT","

A Caltech-led team has developed a safe, effective, and painless breast imaging technique that incorporates machine learning to help differentiate between suspicious and healthy tissue. The method has now been tested on patients and performs as well as or better than other conventional breast imaging techniques.

For decades, X-ray mammography has been the gold standard of breast imaging for the early detection of breast cancer. While the technique remains valuable in terms of reducing cancer deaths, it does expose patients to small amounts of ionizing radiation, painfully squeezes breasts to allow X-rays to more easily pass through tissue, and, especially in the case of dense breast tissue, produces many false positive diagnoses.

Other techniques such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used for breast imaging, but these also have problems. Ultrasound is very safe, but its accuracy is dependent on the skill of the operator and the results are not always conclusive. MRI is time-intensive, expensive, and cannot be used on patients who are allergic to contrast agents or those who are claustrophobic or have certain implants.

We were strongly motivated to work on this problem because none of the current techniques are perfect. The future of medicine has to be better than that.""

Lihong Wang, the Bren Professor of Medical Engineering and Electrical Engineering at Caltech

The technique that Wang and his colleagues have developed and refined over the past 20 years is called photoacoustic computed tomography, or PACT. It offers a breast imaging alternative without the discomfort, high costs, or risk associated with the conventional evaluation methods. PACT features a laser-sonic scanner that can identify tumors in as little as 15 seconds.

Working with researchers at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, California, the team has tested PACT on 39 patients. It achieved comparable results to mammography and MRI in terms of differentiating between suspicious and normal tissue as well as malignant and benign growths or lumps.

The scientists describe PACT and their clinical results in a new paper in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering. The lead authors of the paper are Xin Tong (MS '21), Cindy Z. Liu, and Yilin Luo, graduate students in the Andrew and Peggy Cherng Department of Medical Engineering at Caltech; along with Li Lin (PhD '20), who completed the work while at Caltech and is now at Zhejiang University in China.

""This is the culmination of literally decades of work,"" says Wang, who is also the Andrew and Peggy Cherng Medical Engineering Leadership Chair and executive officer for medical engineering at Caltech. ""We'd like to make PACT a clinical tool that benefits patients-to help detect breast cancer without patients taking the risk of getting cancer or worrying about an allergic reaction.""

PACT works by shining a near-infrared laser pulse into the breast tissue. The laser light diffuses through the breast and is absorbed by molecules. For example, it can be absorbed by oxygen-carrying hemoglobin molecules in the patient's red blood cells, causing the molecules to vibrate ultrasonically.

Unlike X-rays, which travel in a straight line, light waves scatter, or bounce around inside tissues, making it difficult to get high-resolution images. So PACT combines light and sound into a single modality. ""We use light to see the molecules, but we use sound to define the spatial location,"" Wang says.

The vibrations from the molecules travel through the tissue and are picked up by an array of 512 tiny ultrasonic sensors placed over the skin of the breast. Data from those sensors are used to assemble an image of the breast's internal structures in a process that is similar to ultrasound imaging, though much more precise. PACT can provide a clear view of structures as small as a quarter of a millimeter at a depth of 4 centimeters. 

""We basically use molecules to figure out the body's physiology,"" Wang says. ""That's the beauty of photoacoustic tomography: By detecting molecules, we can figure out exactly how the body is functioning. When there's a functional difference, that means we can potentially detect disease better."" For example, PACT is excellent at detecting hemoglobin and therefore revealing angiogenesis, a common signature of breast cancer that involves the growth of additional blood vessels to deliver more nutrient-rich blood to cancerous cells. PACT can also detect tumor hypoxia, another signature of cancer, where fast metabolism outstrips the blood supply, leaving parts of the tumor starved of oxygen.

With the maturity of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, Wang says PACT has become better at detecting abnormalities in breast tissue than it was a few years ago. The scientists trained the system on images of malignant and benign growths or lumps as well as suspicious and healthy tissue, improving its ability to notice subtle variations that indicate what type of tissue has been imaged. Indeed, Wang says, PACT can often detect problematic features that would likely go unnoticed by the human eye.

During a PACT scan, the patient lies face down on a table with a recess containing a warm water bath, ultrasonic sensors, and the laser. One breast at a time is placed in the recess, and the laser shines into it from below. Because the technique is rapid, each scan can be accomplished while the patient holds their breath.

""We started with a basic lab system-just a single-element ultrasound transducer that we rotated around-and it took forever. Now we can do 3D imaging during a single breath, making it very practical,"" Wang says.

Wang adds that in some ways, the new work is just the beginning, as the team believes it will be able to further enhance the technique's imaging quality by adding additional laser wavelengths to the two they currently use and improving additional features. Looking to the future, the team's next steps include acquiring a larger dataset from additional breast cancer volunteers, improving the classification model by leveraging more features, and eventually commercializing the technology.

The paper is titled ""Panoramic photoacoustic computed tomography with learning-based classification enhances breast lesion characterization."" Additional authors are Peng Hu (PhD '23) and Caltech graduate student Junfu Zheng; former Wang lab members Yide Zhang and Rui Cao; and Jessica Dzubnar, Marta Invernizzi, Stephanie Delos Santos, Jaclene Torres, Armine Kasabyan, Lily Lai, and Lisa D. Yee of City of Hope. The work was supported in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health.

Inflammation, long considered a hallmark of aging, may not be a universal human experience, according to a new study from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. The research suggests that ""inflammaging""-chronic, low-grade inflammation associated with aging-appears to be a byproduct of industrialized lifestyles and varies significantly across global populations. The findings are published in Nature Aging.

Researchers analyzed data from four populations: two industrialized groups-the Italian InCHIANTI study and the Singapore Longitudinal Aging Study (SLAS)-and two Indigenous, non-industrialized populations-the Tsimane of the Bolivian Amazon and the Orang Asli of Peninsular Malaysia. While the inflammaging signature was similar between the two industrialized populations, it did not hold in the Indigenous groups, where inflammation levels were largely driven by infection rather than age.

In industrialized settings, we see clear links between inflammaging and diseases like chronic kidney disease. But in populations with high infection rates, inflammation appears more reflective of infectious disease burden than of aging itself.""

Alan Cohen, PhD, lead author, associate professor of Environmental Health Sciences at Columbia Mailman School and faculty member of the Butler Columbia Aging Center

Interestingly, while the indigenous populations, particularly the Tsimane, had high constitutive levels of inflammation, these did not increase with age and, crucially, did not lead to the chronic diseases that plague industrialized societies. In fact, most chronic diseases – diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, etc. – are rare or largely absent in the Indigenous populations, meaning that even when young Indigenous people have profiles that look similar on the surface to those of older industrialized adults, these profiles do not lead to pathological consequences.

""These findings really call into question the idea that inflammation is bad per se,"" said Cohen. ""Rather, it appears that inflammation – and perhaps other aging mechanisms too – may be highly context dependent. On the one hand, that's challenging, because there won't be universal answers to scientific questions. On the other, it's promising, because it means we can intervene and change things.""

The study used a panel of 19 cytokines-small immune-signaling proteins-to assess inflammation patterns. While these markers aligned with aging in the Italian and Singaporean datasets, they did not replicate among the Tsimane and Orang Asli, whose immune systems were shaped by persistent infections and distinct environmental exposures.

Key findings include:

""These results point to an evolutionary mismatch between our immune systems and the environments we now live in,"" Cohen explained. ""Inflammaging may not be a direct product of aging, but rather a response to industrialized conditions.""

The authors call for a reevaluation of how aging and inflammation are measured across populations and emphasize the need for standardized, context-aware tools. ""Factors like environment, lifestyle-such as high physical activity or a very low-fat diet-and infection may all influence how the immune system ages,"" said Cohen. ""Understanding how these elements interact could help develop more effective global health strategies.""

Millions of adults around the world are diagnosed with ADHD every year, and there is a great need for research in the field. However, much clinical research on adult ADHD suffers from serious methodological shortcomings that make it difficult to use the results in practice, researchers from the University of Copenhagen and the University of Sao Paulo show in a new study.

Originally developed for children, the diagnosis of ADHD is often difficult to make in adults. This is partly because the diagnostic criteria are based on behavior in children. When diagnosing adults, however, these criteria are often based on adults' subjective experiences, e.g., of having difficulty concentrating or being very impulsive.

The rising number of adults diagnosed with ADHD raises important questions about diagnostic validity-especially since many were never identified in childhood and are now seeking help, sometimes prompted by ADHD content on social media. That made us curious: how have randomized controlled trials on ADHD dealt with this diagnostic challenge?""

Dr. Igor Studart, Researcher

Moreover, ADHD shares its symptoms with a number of other mental disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, making it crucial to exclude these disorders when diagnosing ADHD. This requires a thorough diagnostic assessment by an experienced psychologist or psychiatrist.

But it is not always the case that such a thorough assessment is made. A new study from the University of Copenhagen and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil now shows that even psychiatric research into ADHD often neglects this fundamental work.

""We have examined how 292 of the most credible studies in evidence-based medicine - the so-called randomised controlled trials - diagnosed their adult subjects,"" says Professor of Psychiatry and Consultant Psychiatrist Julie Nordgaard, who conducted the study together with Associate Professor and Senior Researcher Mads Gram Henriksen and Dr. Igor Studart.

She continues:

""We conclude that half of the studies did not ensure a broad and thorough diagnostic assessment of the patients before the trial to rule out other disorders. This means that they can't actually know, if their subjects have other mental disorders such as depression or schizophrenia. And that's not all. More than half of the studies included subjects, who have also been diagnosed with other mental disorders, making the diagnosis even more difficult to allocate"", Julie Nordgaard explains.

According to the researchers, these methodological shortcomings are problematic, because they imply that it is impossible to know which disorders and symptoms the treatment investigated in these trials potentially had an effect on.

""This makes the research results from many of these clinical trials difficult to utilize. Yet, the results of randomized controlled trials are considered particularly trustworthy, and they may inform the guidelines we use to treat adult ADHD patients, even though the results from many of these trials should be assessed very carefully,"" says Mads Gram Henriksen.

According to the researchers, one of the problems with the diagnostic assessment in many of the clinical trials is that it seems to have been carried out by people who are not trained to do so. And often with methods that are not thorough enough.

""In 61% of the studies, they do not state who diagnosed the subjects. In only 35% of the studies, it is stated that a psychiatrist or psychologist made the diagnosis. But diagnostic assessment should always be performed by an experienced professional with the necessary training to ensure that the diagnosis is made correctly, and this should be stated in the studies' method section,"" explains Mads Gram Henriksen.

In some cases, the assessment and thus the diagnosis was made by the subject themselves, and in one particularly egregious case, it was done with the help of a computer, the researchers explain.

""In psychiatry, we really need that all diagnoses, not just ADHD, are made with the same uniform criteria and by trained professionals. Otherwise, we cannot rely on the results or compare them across studies,"" says Julie Nordgaard and concludes:

""Especially in a situation where a diagnosis such as ADHD in adults is increasing, we need to be very thorough and have a solid foundation. Otherwise, we risk too many people getting a wrong diagnosis and not being able to give them the most effective treatment. Or they risk receiving unnecessary treatment that causes side-effects.""

Because aging weakens cognitive skills, older people can struggle to read difficult social cues. A brain region involved in attention and arousal-the locus coeruleus (LC)-helps with complex tasks, and its connections to the cortex may adapt as humans age to support cognition. To shed more light on this, Maryam Ziaei, from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, and colleagues explored whether the LC and its cortical pathways change over time to help process faces that are difficult to read. 

In their new JNeurosci paper, the researchers imaged the brains of young (21 to 29 years old) and old (67 to 75 years old) adults as they looked at faces. Older adults had more LC activity than younger adults when facial expressions were harder to understand. More specifically, a projection from the LC to a cortical brain area involved in decision making and executive function was stronger in older people. This pathway was the strongest in older adults with better mental well-being and emotional resilience. 

Thus, according to the authors, this LC neural pathway may adapt over time to support difficult social tasks, like reading ambiguous facial expressions. This supportive role may be due to the contributions of this pathway to mental and emotional health. Says Ziaei, ""It may be possible to promote emotional and mental regulation by targeting this pathway. This could help older people facing cognitive decline or even younger people with conditions like anxiety or depression better deal with social processing.""

New research reveals that vaccines enhanced with the AS01 adjuvant may help shield the aging brain from dementia, potentially redefining vaccine benefits beyond infectious disease protection.

Study: Lower risk of dementia with AS01-adjuvanted vaccination against shingles and respiratory syncytial virus infections. Image Credit: ahmetmapush / Shutterstock

In a recent study in npj Vaccines, researchers demonstrated the short-term (18-month) protective effects of the AS01 adjuvant against the risk of subsequent dementia. This retrospective research leveraged electronic health record data (EHR) from the TriNetX US Collaborative Network, comprising more than 436,000 US adults, approximately half of whom were administered an AS01-adjuvanted vaccine, while the rest received a comparable non-AS01-adjuvanted flu vaccine.

Study findings revealed that participants administered AS01-adjuvanted vaccines (Shingrix or Arexvy) were at a significantly lower risk of dementia over the following 18 months than participants who received the flu vaccine. This result remained robust, irrespective of vaccine type or participant sex, suggesting that the protective effects may be attributed mainly to the adjuvant (AS01) and its potential neuroprotective immune responses. These findings open a new frontier in preventive neurology, potentially positioning AS01-adjuvanted vaccines as promising candidates for delaying or preventing dementia.

Flu Vaccine as Comparator: Researchers specifically chose the flu vaccine for comparison because, like RSV, it affects the respiratory system, offering a relevant baseline while lacking the AS01 adjuvant.

Dementia is an umbrella term for several age-associated progressive cognitive declines that can severely hamper daily activities. Dementia represents a global public health concern, estimated to impact more than 57 million people (2021), most of whom are women. In today's aging world, dementia prevalence continues to rise, with projections suggesting that 139 million adults will have dementia by 2050.

Unfortunately, dementia remains without a cure, with current research efforts focused on identifying its risk factors and developing effective preventive interventions. In light of this, the current research group made an intriguing discovery in their previous work: Shingrix, a shingles vaccine, was associated with a lower risk of dementia compared to live anti-varicella-zoster virus vaccines.

Researchers hypothesized that this either meant that shingles was linked to dementia, or AS01, an adjuvant added to Shingrix to improve its efficacy (no AS01 in live vaccines), was contributing to the observed reduced dementia risk. However, these findings were observational, which raises questions about whether this benefit was derived from better viral protection (against shingles or the varicella-zoster virus) or from interactions between the immune-boosting agents.

Measuring the Benefit: The reduced dementia risk translated to extra time lived without a diagnosis: 87 extra days for RSV vaccinees, 53 days for shingles vaccinees, and 113 days for those getting both, among those diagnosed within 18 months.

In the present study, researchers sought to isolate the effects of potential shingles-dementia associations by explicitly investigating if AS01 can alter the short-term risk of dementia diagnosis. To do this, they compared individuals who received AS01-adjuvanted vaccines with controls who received a flu vaccine devoid of AS01.

The study compared the relative risk of dementia diagnosis among members of each cohort over the subsequent 18 months. Participant data was obtained from the United States (US) TriNetX Collaborative Network. The electronic health record (EHR) dataset comprised 436,788 US adults (60+ yrs; majority between 70-73) who were administered Shingrix (n = 103,798), Arexvy (another AS01-adjuvanted RSV vaccine; n = 35,938), or a non-AS01-adjuvanted vaccine against the common flu.

Notably, the controls were sociodemographically and medically matched (66 variables) to cases via propensity score matching. Outcomes of interest included positive dementia diagnoses (International Classification of Diseases [ICD-10] codes) within the 18 months following study enrolment/vaccine administration.

Statistical analyses included the Kaplan-Meier estimator for calculating incidences of outcomes, the generalised Schoenfeld approach for assumption testing, and clinically meaningful estimations using a restricted mean time lost (RMTL) model. The primary statistical comparisons were between these vaccine-defined cohorts, and analyses were also stratified by sex.

Mouse Model Insight: Laboratory work cited in the paper suggests a specific ingredient in AS01 (monophosphoryl lipid A, or MPL) improved Alzheimer's disease pathology in mice, offering a potential biological pathway for the observed effect.

The study demonstrated several compelling findings. First, AS01-adjuvanted vaccines showed impressive short-term (18 months) protective effects against the risk of dementia. Participants who received Arexvy showed a 29% lower risk of dementia compared to controls, while those who received Shingrix showed an 18% reduction. Those who received both vaccines saw a 37% lower risk.

Notably, the protective impacts of these vaccines were statistically indistinguishable, strengthening support that the AS01 adjuvant, the only commonality between the vaccines, is a plausible explanation for the observed protective effect. Independent laboratory studies bolster this idea, though the paper's authors note that the exact mechanisms remain speculative. They highlight that AS01 activates innate immune cells, such as microglia, thereby enhancing pathogen clearance and reducing inflammation processes implicated in Alzheimer's disease and the risk and progression of dementia.

Interestingly, the authors report a key limitation that may mean the protective effect is even stronger than observed. The RSV vaccine group likely included some patients who received a non-AS01 vaccine, suggesting the true impact of the AS01-adjuvanted vaccine (Arexvy) may be underestimated.

In contrast, the hypothesized anti-viral benefits of these vaccines on dementia risk (and by extension, the potential associations between the diseases and dementia) remain unlikely. These results remained robust following sensitivity testing and adjustments for vaccine type and sex. However, the authors stress that, because the study is observational, it reveals that unmeasured confounding factors may influence an association rather than a proven causal link, and the findings.

A. Association between AS01-adjuvanted vaccines and risk of dementia, negative control outcome, and zoster infection. Each dot and bold number represent the ratio of restricted mean time lost (RMTL) for the comparison between two cohorts, while horizontal lines and numbers in brackets are 95% confidence intervals. RMTL ratios below 1 indicate that the risk is lower in the first cohort (e.g., recipients of the RSV vaccine on the first line) than in the second (e.g., recipients of the flu vaccine). B. Associations between AS01-adjuvanted vaccines (compared to flu vaccine) and risk of dementia in females, males, and in the cohorts including people who developed dementia within the first 3 months post-vaccination.

This real-world study contributes to the growing body of evidence that AS01-adjuvanted vaccines may protect brain health beyond their intended viral targets. With both RSV and shingles vaccines showing significant dementia risk reduction (29% for RSV and 18% for shingles), their shared efficacy, rather than specific disease prevention, appears key to their holistic dementia-preventive effects.

The findings strongly support the need for future randomized clinical trials to confirm these effects and test AS01 boosters for the prevention of dementia. If confirmed, we may be able to harness vaccine platforms not just for infectious disease control, but as tools to delay or prevent cognitive decline, thereby representing a significant paradigm shift in preventive geriatrics.

Check out some key statistics and facts from the USWNT's 4-0 victory over Ireland. (0:58)

United States women's national team midfielder Lily Yohannes is finalizing a move to French powerhouse OL Lyonnes, multiple sources confirmed to ESPN.

Lyonnes, the eight-time champions of Europe, have agreed to terms on a transfer with Ajax for the 18-year-old American. Yohannes is expected to finalize personal terms with Lyonnes in the coming days.

A source told ESPN that the fee is around €450k, with Ajax also receiving a percentage in a future transfer. Yohannes' contract with Ajax ran through June 2026.

English champions Chelsea were also in the running to sign Yohannes, sources previously told ESPN's Emily Keogh.

Yohannes has eight caps for the USWNT. She scored 10 minutes into her debut in June 2024 as a 17-year-old.

In November, Yohannes declared her decision to represent the United States internationally. She previously had not decided amid interest from the Netherlands, where she was reportedly in the process of securing Dutch citizenship.

Yohannes was born in Virginia and her family moved to the Netherlands when she was 10. She signed a professional contract with Ajax at age 15.

In 2023, when she was 16, Yohannes became the youngest player to ever start a UEFA Women's Champions League match when she started for Ajax in a 2-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain.

""She's got unbelievable maturity and coachability, and someone who I know is going to become an important part of our program,"" USWNT head coach Emma Hayes told reporters in May.

""But I'm invested in that development, and we have to be patient with that considering her tender age and her lack of international and high-level experience.""

Also on Tuesday, Canada defender Ashley Lawrence left Chelsea to join OL Lyonnes after two years in west London.

Lawrence, 30, signed a three-year contract with the French powerhouse.

Manager Mauricio Pochettino has had to pivot without his program's top talent as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, and other European based players decided to take off during the tournament. It resulted in a changing dynamic, without top stars, such players as PSV's Malik Tillman and Real Salt Lake's Diego Luna have had to step up. Charlotte FC's Patrick Agyemang has taken control of the striker role, while Chris Richards and St. Louis native Tim Ream have been the first choice center-back pair throughout the tournament. The Columbus Crew's Max Arfsten has also been Pochettino's preferred option, replacing Jedi Robinson, but his play has highlighted the issues with depth among the current US player pool; Arfsten has been great in the attack but has lacked the defensive range to cover as well against the ball.

Positional battles have been the key story following disastrous losses against Switzerland and Türkiye leading into the tournament, with NYCFC's Matt Freese cementing himself as the first-choice goalkeeper. Freese came up big in Sunday's penalty shootout and bounced back from his unfortunate error against Haiti in group stage. It has led to a scenario where the US team not been its strongest and needed penalty kicks to advance past Costa Rica. But the team has avoided the dreaded upset, unlike other tournament favorites, such as Canada and Panama.

Then there's Guatemala, which advanced through the Gold Cup group stage with wins over Jamaica and Guadeloupe before shocking everyone with their penalty kick win over Canada last Sunday. Former Real Salt Lake striker Rubio Rubin scored the pivotal equalizer that sent the match to penalties, a Cinderella moment for a country ranked 106 in the FIFA rankings. Now, the team will face the USMNT for the first time since 2016. 

Guatemala might look familiar to some St. Louis fans, as they're flanked by a few MLS veterans. Olger Escobar is an 18-year-old CF Montreal player from Massachusetts. Aaron Herrera is a longtime MLS fullback who played five seasons for Real Salt Lake before spending the last two seasons with DC United. Despite some familiarity, Luis Fernando Tena has led a squad of mostly Guatemalan domestic players into the Gold Cup semifinal for the first time since 1996.

The US still has the talent advantage ahead of this one and should feel confident about reaching the final and a potential rematch with Mexico. Guatemala has been greater than the sum of its parts throughout the tournament, however, compared to a US team that has yet to find its stride.

The US doesn't have any more dress rehearsals ahead of next year's World Cup, and there's now a sense of urgency around Pochettino's ability to get the most out of his players. It's the last chance to impress for players such as Arfsten and Sebastian Berhalter—and potentially the last time that Tim Ream will suit up for the national team in St. Louis. The pressure is on.

Alejandro Moreno speaks about Mauricio Pochettino's time as manager of the USMNT. (1:59)

With the 2026 World Cup suddenly less than a year away, we can now introduce a new layer of worry into the already-twisted collective psyche of the U.S. men's national team fan base: Who should and who should not play for a new club?

To be clear, this isn't as simple as wanting each American player to eventually play for Liverpool or Real Madrid. It's not about wanting to see them challenge themselves and make as much money as they can over their short careers or anything like that. No, that's because if you play for Liverpool or Real Madrid, there's a good chance that you won't, well, play. And, theoretically, there's nothing worse for the USMNT than heading into next summer with a bunch of its stars covered in rust from sitting on the sidelines all season.

I say ""theoretically"" because it's just that: a theory. Or maybe just a collective conclusion. The way to optimize the USMNT's performance would be to find the clubs that exactly match each player's highest talent level and allows them to (A) consistently get on the field, and (B) improve as a player.

A 2019 paper in ""Nature Communications"" coined the idea of ""The Eighty Five Percent Rule"" for optimal learning. If a task is too easy, you don't learn anything from it. But if a task is too hard, you also don't learn from it. Instead, what the paper found is that the ideal level of difficulty to produce learning is something that produces an 85% success rate and a 15% fail rate. What USMNT fans want, then, is for every player to find his 85% club.

But since the club and country situations for Americans are increasingly at odds with each other, this rarely happens. The wider market's interests aren't aligned with the USMNT's interests. So, if it doesn't happen -- if some stars struggle for playing time next season -- how much does it actually matter for the USMNT? How much does this transfer window really matter for the USMNT's 2026 World Cup?

For this part of the exercise, we'll ignore MLS. Presumably for anyone good enough to receive significant playing time for the USMNT next summer, the ease of MLS would be well above that 85% success-rate level. If you're not playing in MLS, you're not making the World Cup roster.

So, to start, here's a list from this past season of the 32 Americans who played the most minutes across Europe's Big Five leagues, any of the three UEFA competitions, the English Championship, and the Dutch Eredivisie:

There's a top tier with the three best players in the pool (Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson and Weston McKennie), plus a pair of Championship mainstays in Brenden Aaronson and Aidan Morris, and a guy who just transferred to Atletico Madrid in Johnny Cardoso.

Below them, there's another tier of players who played a lot for lesser teams in the Big Five leagues or teams in the Eredivisie. The third tier contains players who were in and out of the starting lineups for Champions League and Premier League teams. And then the final tier is mostly players on the fringe of the USMNT squad, plus Ricardo Pepi and Giovanni Reyna.

If the World Cup started tomorrow and everyone was healthy, my guess is that the starting 11 might look something like this: Matt Tuner in goal; Sergiño Dest and Robinson at fullback; Mark McKenzie and Chris Richards at center back: a midfield three of Tyler Adams, McKennie, and Yunus Musah; a front three of Timothy Weah, Pulisic, and Folarin Balogun.

Here's how much playing time those 11 players would've had, heading into the tournament:

Goalkeeper, Matt Turner: 0% of available minutes with Crystal Palace
Right back, Sergiño Dest: 9% of available minutes with PSV
Center back, Chris Richards: 56.2% of available minutes with Crystal Palace
Center back, Mark McKenzie: 81.6% of available minutes with Toulouse
Left back, Antonee Robinson: 92.6% of available minutes with Fulham
Midfield, Tyler Adams: 57.5% of available minutes with Bournemouth
Midfield, Yunus Musah: 45.9% of available minutes with AC Milan
Midfield, Weston McKennie: 66% of available minutes with Juventus
Right wing, Christian Pulisic: 72.2% of available minutes with AC Milan
Forward, Folarin Balogun: 17.8% of available minutes with Monaco
Left wing, Tim Weah: 50.4% of available minutes with Juventus

That averages out to 49.3% of the minutes for this projected starting lineup. Remove Matt Turner, who plays a position at which you never get sub minutes, and it still only jumps up to 53.6%. At face value, it seems as if you'd want your starting lineup to be playing significantly more than half of the available minutes for their club teams ahead of the World Cup.

But we still need to account for the quality of the minutes. Per the club Elo ratings, Crystal Palace rank as the 16th-best team in the world. As for the rest: PSV are 25th, Toulouse 75th, Fulham 33rd, Bournemouth 21st, Milan 30th, Juventus 22nd, and Monaco 36th.

Average all of that together, and you get a ranking of just about 30th. To oversimplify this into understandable terms: the average USMNT starter is playing about half of the minutes for a team at AC Milan's level. In other words, it's a team of 11 Yunus Musahs.

If we focus at the high end, here's how Argentina's starting lineup looked for the World Cup final. Given that the tournament was played midway through the European campaign, I've included the minutes percentages at the time of the World Cup, rather than for the full club season:

Goalkeeper, Emi Martinez: 95.9% of minutes for Aston Villa
Right back, Nahuel Molina: 77.4% of minutes for Atletico Madrid
Center back, Cristian Romero: 57.7% of minutes for Tottenham
Center back, Nicolas Otamendi: 95.6% of minutes for Benfica
Left back, Nicolas Tagliafico: 98.4% of minutes for Lyon
Midfield, Enzo Fernandez: 87.7% of minutes for Benfica
Midfield, Rodrigo De Paul: 51.6% of minutes for Atletico Madrid
Midfield, Alexis Mac Allister: 99.8% of minutes for Brighton
Right wing, Lionel Messi: 82.9% of minutes for Paris Saint-Germain
Center forward, Julian Alvarez: 42.7% of minutes for Manchester City
Left wing, Angel Di Maria: 20.7% of minutes for Juventus

On average, that's 72.1% of the playing time. Unfortunately, Club Elo has deactivated access to its past ranking data, but there's still a pretty clear set up here: eight guys playing for Champions League clubs, and three guys playing every minute of every game for teams that weren't in the Champions League.

On ""The Football Reporters"" podcast, Jeff Carlisle explains Mauricio Pochettino's reaction to the USMNT's high-profile Gold Cup absentees.

But here's where the USMNT differs from Argentina and the other top national teams in the world. These countries have way more talent depth, and so coaches are often picking players based on how well they're playing with their club teams. Unlike as has often been the case for the U.S., coaches usually don't have a set 11 that they stick with, regardless of a player's current club form.

I'm less convinced that Argentina did so well because they played so many players who were playing a lot for their clubs teams. Rather, if you assume club coaches have a level of expertise in picking lineups to win games -- that they know how to identify talent and play their best players since they see them every day -- then a national team manager like Argentina's Lionel Scaloni is mostly using the expertise of other coaches to help him pick his most talented squad.

At most positions, you simply can't do this as the USMNT manager. To go with a clearly hypothetical example: If there's one goalkeeper on Crystal Palace and another one on New York City FC, you can assume that the former is more talented than the latter. But how do you deal with the Crystal Palace guy playing zero minutes and the NYCFC guy playing all of the minutes?

Perhaps it's more useful, then, to compare the USMNT to itself. While opinions are mixed on the team's performance at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, most of those opinions are wrong. The USMNT went undefeated in the group, played England even, beat a very tough-to-break-down Iran team in a must-win match, then got a tough round-of-16 draw but really did play the Netherlands closer than the score line suggested.

If we look at the 11 most-used players from the 2022 World Cup, here's how the playing-time dynamic shakes out:

Goalkeeper, Matt Turner: 16.7% of minutes for Arsenal
Right back, Sergiño Dest: 19.8% of minutes for AC Milan
Center back, Walker Zimmerman: 82.8% of minutes for Nashville SC
Center back, Tim Ream: 99.9% of minutes for Fulham
Left back, Antonee Robinson: 82.1% of minutes for Fulham
Midfield, Tyler Adams: 92.6% of minutes for Leeds United
Midfield, Yunus Musah: 67.4% of minutes for Valencia
Midfield, Weston McKennie: 57.2% of minutes for Juventus
Right wing, Tim Weah: 23.4% of minutes for Lille
Center forward, Josh Sargent: 77.7% of minutes for Norwich City
Left wing, Christian Pulisic: 28.7% of minutes for Chelsea

That averages out to 52.8% of the club minutes for the USMNT's 11 most-used players at the World Cup. Or, not too different than how things stand now. And I think the current group is playing for much better club teams, on average, than the 2022 group.

The Premier League midtable is stronger than ever right now, and that's where Robinson, Adams, and Richards all sit as starters. Musah has traded relegation-battling Valencia for Champions League-challenging Milan. Weah has moved from Lille to Juventus, and the center-forward spot swaps Josh Sargent on a midtable Championship side for Balogun and Champions League-qualified Monaco.

Plus, the two lowest outfield minutes-getters in the USMNT's potential 11 for next summer were so low because they were injured. Neither Dest nor Balogun are in bad club situations where we'd expect them to ride the bench this upcoming season if they can stay healthy. To the extent that either player is facing concerns, the solution isn't a transfer to a new club.

Gab Marcotti believes Johnny Cardoso's proposed move from Real Betis to Atlético Madrid is a ""big step up"" for the USMNT midfielder.

Really, the one player whose issues could be solved with a transfer is Turner, who seems as if he finally has lost his starting job with the national team after barely playing professional soccer for three straight seasons. That might have all been fixed by his expected move to Lyon this summer, but that was all reported before the French club were relegated into Ligue 2 for violating the league's financial rules. He needs to play, and as a goalkeeper, it doesn't really matter how good the team is -- it just matters that he's being tested by quality opponents every week.

Other key USMNT players probably will change teams this summer -- and some of those moves will work out while others will fail. That's not me being glib; it's just a fact. Only about half of all transfers with a fee of at least $10 million end up with the player playing at least 50% of the minutes with his new club. But outside of extreme cases such as Turner or Reyna, whose careers have stalled for multiple seasons in a row, no transfer activity this summer will have a meaningful effect on how well the USMNT plays next summer.

Just go back to the last World Cup: Pulisic was the USMNT's best player -- and he was in the midst of the worst season of his professional career. Despite starting only two league games on a loan with AC Milan for the season, Dest created more assists and took more shots for the U.S. than anyone other than Pulisic.

Here, though, the comparison expands beyond just the Americans. In the final against France, Argentina's front three featured the best player to ever do it, Lionel Messi, but then two players who were in the middle of disappointing club campaigns.

Ángel Di María had just made a seemingly mistaken move to Juventus, where he'd stay for only one season and would start only 15 league games, fewer than in any season since he joined Real Madrid from Benfica in 2010. And then between Messi and Di Maria was the 22-year-old Julián Álvarez, the latest Argentine super prospect. Rather than going from River Plate to a second-tier Champions League club such as Borussia Dortmund or AC Milan where he'd be all-but-assured of more playing time, he jumped straight to the best team in the world, Manchester City. During the 2022-23 season, he started only 13 league games.

There were plenty of other talented, big-name players who were getting more playing time than either Di María or Álvarez in 2022: Lautaro Martínez, Paulo Dybala, Papu Gómez. But after the opening loss to Saudi Arabia, Argentine manager Scaloni opted for Álvarez and Di María, up top with Messi, for the rest of the tournament. Álvarez scored twice in the semifinal. Di María drew a penalty and scored a goal in the final.

I don't have to tell you what happened after that.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

U.S. men's national team striker Patrick Agyemang is the subject of an offer in the region of $8 million (£5.8m) from English Championship side Derby County, according to multiple sources familiar with the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the negotiations.

Agyemang has green lit the move to Derby, whose offer has not yet been accepted by Charlotte FC.

The 24-year-old has drawn interest from several European clubs dating back to last summer. Charlotte previously rejected a $4 million approach from Luton Town, according to GiveMeSport, which first reported the $8 million Derby offer.

Agyemang, 24, has 18 goals and six assists in 63 career games with Charlotte FC. The 6-foot-4 native of East Hartford, Connecticut, played collegiately at Eastern Connecticut State, an NCAA Division III side, and Rhode Island before being drafted 12th overall in the 2023 MLS SuperDraft.

Agyemang made his debut with the U.S. national team this January under coach Mauricio Pochettino, scoring twice across a pair of U.S. wins. Those performances earned him continued call-ups, and he has been the U.S.'s starting striker for this summer's Gold Cup. Agyemang has five goals in 10 U.S. appearances.

Derby County finished in 19th place in the Championship in 2024-25, one point out of the relegation zone in England's second tier.

It would be a big move at a crucial time for Agyemang.

His competition at the forward position with the U.S. squad is deep. One of his rivals for a spot on the 2026 World Cup roster, Josh Sargent, plays in the same league and was one of the Championship's best strikers last season.

Agyemang will get plenty of games at Derby, but he'll need to show he can score consistently in order to secure a place on the World Cup roster. Moves in the year leading up to the World Cup always carry risk.

There is a good example with the U.S. team: Ricardo Pepi moved from FC Dallas to Augsburg in Germany's Bundesliga in January 2022, less than a year out from the Qatar tournament. Pepi couldn't stay on the field in Germany and despite a loan to Groningen in Holland in September, and a flurry of goals, it wasn't enough to get him back into Gregg Berhalter's squad in the winter.

Agyemang has clearly made a good impression on Pochettino but if this deal gets across the line, he'll need his form to carry him through to next summer.

THE UNITED STATES IS THROUGH to the semifinals of the 2025 Gold Cup after defeating Costa Rica in a shootout following a 2-2 score after 90 minutes. The big takeaway is that while the U.S. team is not where it needs to be, there are noticeable improvements as the team is showing fight, resiliency, and not collapsing when hit with adversity.

Over the past year, the U.S. team has been its own worst enemy and has struggled to get through difficult moments – such as Tim Weah's red card against Panama at the Copa America, or the multitude of mistakes at the Nations League in March. This has been a tough task for head coach Mauricio Pochettino to fix.

Against Costa Rica in a knockout game, the U.S. team fought through their own mistakes and kept pressing until they won. Sure, tougher opponents will provide a more accurate measuring stick. But winning tough CONCACAF games is certainly a good starting point given that the team was struggling against similar teams recently.

On Sunday night, the U.S. gifted Costa Rica a goal after Max Arfsten conceded a penalty. Then later in the first half, Malik Tillman failed to convert a penalty that would have evened the game.

This was a game that the U.S. team might have seemingly wilted in recent months. But the U.S. team kept pushing. Diego Luna equalized just before the half and then Arfsten put the U.S. team ahead early in the second half.

It's a total team effort. pic.twitter.com/boXDGiscfB

 

After Costa Rica equalized later in the second half with poor defending, the U.S. found a difference maker in Matt Freese who made three saves in the shootout to get the team through.

This is a classic example of a glass that is either half full or half empty. It's now how you want to look at it? Mistakes are bad. Fighting through it is good. Not making mistakes and winning comfortably is optimal.

I don't think anyone is making this result as a clear sign the team is where it wants to be ahead of the World Cup. But some of the elements that the team displayed against Costa Rica have been missing.

The best you can say, and the correct take, is that his was a win which the team can build. Slowly there is more positivity around the group and it took a winning mindset to prevail. Now, they just have to play better.

Here are some thoughts on the game.

 

 

Max Arfsten had a baffling game. He was part of all four goals. He conceded the penalty. Then he assisted on the equalizer with a nice pass to Diego Luna. Then he scored after being set up by Tillman. He then helped create a few other chances. Then he failed to defend effectively on the second Costa Rica goal.

The deal with Arfsten is that he is a winger by trade. He was only converted to being a wingback by Columbus Crew head coach Wilfried Nancy. But that formation one where he typically has three central defenders behind him in a three-man backline.

A golden hour moment in the @GoldCup for @maxarfsten's first international goal! ? pic.twitter.com/Dr33KUFQjh

 

Now, he comes to the national team and is playing a more traditional left back role. At times, it looks as if he is uncomfortable. He allows too much space and needs to defend more 1v1 situations against opposing wingers.

On the flip side, he is aggressive getting forward and he does provide some effective width in the U.S. team's attack.

The question is how quickly or even if he will improve his shortcomings? Will he work on playing a traditional left back position at Columbus – or at another club if he moves?

Arfsten is a good player in certain roles and certain formations. But does that make him a good fit for the USMNT moving forward?

 

 

Matt Freese wasn't tested much in the group stages and he didn't have to make many big saves. But his one standout moment wasn't positive as he gave the ball away trying to play out of the back against Haiti and surrendered a goal in the process.

Despite questions, Pochettino stuck with Freese and Freese came up big in the shootout with a trio of big stops.

When observing Pochettino's style in his first year as the coach, he seems to be forgiving when players make a mistake. Afterall, any player can make a mistake.

When we needed a big stop on Sunday night, Matt Freese delivered three of 'em. ???????????? pic.twitter.com/U357Ka1yCm

 

Instead, he wants to see players respond well by not making a similar mistake and by raising their game. Freese did everything that Pochettino wanted.

Freese is probably in a better position than many realize. Goalkeeping coach Toni Jimenez is key member of Pochettino's staff at every stop. Pochettino trusts Jimenez and Jimenez works with the U.S. keepers. This certainly not a “gut” decision from Pochettino to give Freese the starting job at this tournament. Rather, Freese must be showing well in training and matching what Jimenez/Pochettino want to be given this opportunity.

If Freese makes the most of this tournament, he could continue as the starter heading into the fall. Matt Turner clearly is under pressure to change things.

 

Alex Freeman hasn't had any big moments at this Gold Cup, but he has been consistently solid. This is even more impressive considering that he is still in his first season as a starter for Orlando City. He earned a lot of rave reviews for his performances this season and it is easy to see the reasons for the hype. The fullback position in the modern game demands elite athleticism – and Freeman has that in droves.

ALEX FREEMAN MAKES THE PENALTY FOR THE @USMNT ????????:????????????:???? pic.twitter.com/xtJBapDFzC

 

It is easy to see why Pochettino is interested in Freeman. Freeman covers the lines well and can keep up with speedy wingers. He also thrives in the physical side of the game. He tackles, wins duels, doesn't get bumped off the ball, and he is a huge help in set pieces.

What is also interesting is that Freeman took the fourth penalty kick in the shootout. That is sign that the team and coaches respect his maturity at the stage of his career.

Freeman, 20, is still green and still has a lot to learn. But it should not be surprising at all if Freeman is seen by the staff as a World Cup player next year.

 

 

Former USMNT head coach and World Cup defender Gregg Berhalter attended the game, which was good. A parent who has a long history with the national team should enjoy seeing his son get such an opportunity.

Sticking with Sebastian Berhalter, he missed his shootout attempt but he continues to be dependable and solid. It still is a tough path for him to make the World Cup team, but he's in the mix. His set piece deliveries have been consistently dangerous – and that is something that has not been great for the USMNT for quite some time.

If Berhalter is to increase his chances of making the World Cup team, he must adapt to the physical side of the game more. His skill on the ball is sufficient, but being able to shield the backline and win balls is important.

This tournament continues to show the strength of Tyler Adams. There isn't anyone else in the pool who can do what he does as a defensive midfielder. After this tournament, Pochettino really needs to figure out what is Plan B in Adams can't go. Does he go back and keep looking at players such as Tanner Tessmann or Aidan Morris?

Patrick Agyemang didn't score, but he had a good game. His hold up play was pretty important to what the U.S. team wanted. Often as the team transitioned into the attack, the plan was to get the ball to Agyemang who would then play it off to others. His physicality really allows him to handle those responsibilities well.

It was good to see Damion Downs have his first big moment for the USMNT when he scored the winning shootout goal. He has a very bright future and moments like that can help build up his connection with the badge.

Interesting parallels in the shootout. Freeman is the son of a legendary NFL wild receiver but who never showed much interest in American football. Born in Germany, Downs spent much of his childhood in Texas where he fell in love with American football – only adopting soccer at the age of nine when he moved back to Germany. Both Freeman and Downs scored to help the USMNT prevail.

Malik Tillman has been the best player in the entire Gold Cup, so far. In this game, it was a little harder for him as he missed a penalty and was dispossessed four times. Despite that, he still converted his shootout attempt and assisted on Arfsten's goal. He was yet another player who showed some resilience to contribute to the victory.

Tillman has had a big year, and the coming 12-13 months are going to be even bigger. His value has skyrocketed and next year he should be a big part of the equation for the USMNT.

Diego Luna scored a big goal that equalized the game. Yes, it took a deflection, but the skill was in how he controlled the pass from Arfsten. It was a very nice touch. Luna can go quiet for stretches, but he always has the potential to pop up and make something happen.

Overall, the U.S. team played well but the weakness was in how the U.S. midfield lost control of the game for a long stretch in the second half that allowed Costa Rica to build back into it. Part of that is on Pochettino who didn't make any changes until the 78th minute. It is puzzling that he waited that long, especially after Costa Rica's subs in the 58th minute brought life into the game for them.

It raises the possibility that Pochettino really likes that USMNT lineup and did not trust his bench in that moment. Johnny Cardoso's ankle is bothering him and Haji Wright has already left the team with an injury. That already left Pochettino with limited options.

But it was also telling that neither Aaronson brother got into the game, and both are fresh and both are on the roster bubble as it is.","{'href': 'http://americansoccernow.com', 'title': 'American Soccer Now'}","soccer"

...

MINNEAPOLIS — The buzzword was “generational talent.” The possibilities, everyone agreed, were limitless. The U.S. men's national team had been starving for a creative No. 10, and up through the ranks came a blessing, Gio Reyna. He broke into Borussia Dortmund teams before his 18th birthday. He broke several of Christian Pulisic's “youngest to” records. He cracked countless lists of soccer's top teens, and by 2026, everyone assumed, he'd be driving the USMNT.

But with 2026 near, Reyna's career is on ice, and instead, another languid playmaker born in 2002 is seizing control of the U.S. attack.

Malik Tillman has the keys, and he's using them.

In a span of less than nine hours Sunday and Monday, here in the Midwest and across the pond in Europe, two events further established Tillman as a potential USMNT centerpiece. First, he helped drive the U.S. to a Gold Cup quarterfinal victory. Then, by the time he awoke — or perhaps before he went to sleep — Bayer Leverkusen reportedly reached an agreement to buy Tillman for well over $40 million.

He will likely become the second-most expensive American soccer player ever, behind only Pulisic, when the deal is finalized.

And an ocean away, at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, he showed why.

Tillman was far from perfect in a dramatic win over Costa Rica. (And yes, it was only Costa Rica.) But he glided around a subpar pitch, dictated the USMNT's most dangerous moves, contributed to two goals, and also won a penalty (which he missed).

He spent much of the game lurking, on the prowl for space between Costa Rican lines, and when his teammates found him, he did things that very few players in the U.S. pool are capable of doing.

Some might argue the list includes only Tillman and Reyna. Maybe Christian Pulisic.

Reyna, though, hasn't played 90 minutes of competitive soccer in a year. Over the last four years, he has played 70-plus minutes in only seven official matches for his clubs. He has only played once, for 21 minutes as a sub, under U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino. He is currently at the Club World Cup, but, as per usual, he is stuck on Dortmund's bench.

Tillman, meanwhile, is rising.

Born in Germany to an American father, he first rose through Bayern Munich's academy. He learned on loan at Rangers in Scotland. Then he really rose at PSV Eindhoven. In 2024-25, despite missing three months with an ankle injury, he was one of the very best players in the entire Dutch Eredivisie. That's when Leverkusen came calling; that's why Leverkusen apparently sees him as a replacement for Liverpool-bound Florian Wirtz.

For the U.S., Tillman had never quite justified the hype. Entering this summer, he'd never scored or assisted a senior national team goal. Nonetheless, with ranks depleted, Pochettino built a makeshift Gold Cup squad around Tillman. And the 23-year-old has repaid Poch's faith.

He scored twice in a beatdown of Trinidad and Tobago. He dazzled in an inconsequential win over Haiti. Sunday, though, brought the first true-ish test … and Tillman dazzled again.

Throughout the 90 minutes, his full repertoire was on display. He combined with Patrick Agyemang several times on the edge of the box. In the 31st minute, with U.S. possession stagnant, he enlivened it with a lovely flick, a bursting run into the box, and a dangerous cross that earned the U.S. a penalty.

On paper, he started as a right winger; but in reality, he lives in the so-called “half-spaces,” in the interior “pockets” between an opponent's fullback, center back and midfielders.

He roamed those spaces on Sunday, with the “freedom” that Pochettino has given him. He found space, but far too often, the U.S. didn't find him — and on a few occasions, he appeared frustrated.

But at halftime, coaches showed players a few instructive clips. The message, Tillman said, was to “find different spaces” and “the opposite side.”

Sure enough, less than two minutes after halftime, when the U.S. circulated the ball from left to right, Chris Richards activated Tillman with an expertly disguised pass. Tillman, with the ball en route to his feet, glanced ever so briefly over his left shoulder; saw he had time and space to turn; played a 1-2 with Agyemang, and set up Max Arfsten's first career USMNT goal.

That you saw. What you probably don't recall is how the U.S. gained possession in the first place. That, too, was thanks to Tillman.

His pressing — including his back-pressing, as seen above — is an underrated part of his game. The nonchalant, almost leisurely way Tillman moves can fool some first-time observers. Statistically, at PSV, compared to other attacking midfielders and wingers in mid-tier leagues, his tackling and interceptions ranked in the 97th and 99th percentile, respectively, this past season. Even compared to true midfielders, he's in the 81st percentile, per FBref. And he's been similarly active defensively for the U.S.

He is hardly flawless. He bore some fault on Costa Rica's second goal, when he tried to force a through ball into a non-existent window. And then, when it was intercepted, rather than race back into position, he brought his hands to his head and almost sulked, enabling Los Ticos to build their possession.

His utility, though, outweighs his shortcomings.

He has even added long-range shooting to his arsenal, and nearly scored a banger Sunday. He'll probably be the chief goal threat when the U.S. meets Guatemala in Wednesday's semifinal (7 p.m. ET, FS1/Univision).

It's his off-ball movement, though, that is perhaps his best trait. And it's less about dynamism, more about intelligence. It's sneaky, and often slow, almost Messi-like. As 19 other players jog side to side, following the ball, Tillman will often walk — because he knows that a lack of movement, coupled with the movement of opposing midfielders, is sometimes the best way to create passing lanes.

He can also run off a target man like Agyemang. He can join strikers in the box, as he did for a goal against Haiti.

He does not have Reyna's vision or creativity. In fact, all in all, the two are very different players. But he currently has the spot that once seemed earmarked for Reyna, and a chance to make it his own ahead of the World Cup next summer.

The question, of course, is how he'll cope with higher levels. Costa Rica isn't Colombia; Haiti isn't Japan. And Heracles Almelo isn't RB Leipzig. Eredivisie stardom, historically, is notoriously not predictive of stardom elsewhere. There is a chance that Tillman's occasional slowness and inconsistent sharpness humble him in the Bundesliga and against better national teams. There's a chance that all this success is a mirage.

There is also a chance he doesn't mesh with Christian Pulisic, Tim Weah, Weston McKennie and the rest of the USA's A-squad. There's a chance he doesn't ultimately fit in Pochettino's starting 11.

For now, however, there is genuine excitement that the USMNT has found a No. 10, a playmaker who can operate between lines and pick locks that, in the past, have proven unbreakable.

“Malik is an unbelievable talent,” Pochettino said last fall, shortly after taking the U.S. job.

Perhaps not generational, but, as Pochettino said more recently, “one of the most talented players that we have in the USA.”","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Man City boss Pep Guardiola puts his side's exit at the Club World Cup down to ""minor margins"" following their 4-3 defeat to Al Hilal. (0:55)

ORLANDO, Florida -- Pep Guardiola has told his Manchester City players to ""rest their minds"" in preparation for the new season after they were dumped out of the FIFA Club World Cup by Al Hilal.

City were shocked by the Saudi side 4-3 in extra time at Camping World Stadium on Monday.

Guardiola said it was ""a pity"" his team could not go further, but immediately turned his attention to the start of the Premier League in August.

""We would have loved to have continued,"" the City boss said. ""[You are] only here once every four years. We had a feeling that the team is doing well, but we go home and now it's time to rest and rest our minds for the new season.

""The vibe was really good. I cannot thank Manchester City enough and especially the players for training and how they have been playing. The margins are minimal.""

Guardiola admitted City had not been ""clinical"" enough against Al Hilal, particularly during a first half in which they had a number of chances to score.

Morocco goalkeeper Yassine Bounou was in inspired form and allowed his team to come back into the game in the second-half and eventually prevail on a rollercoaster evening thanks to Marcos Leonardo's 112th-minute winner.

""In the end we have to score and be clinical,"" Guardiola said. ""They did not create much in the first half, we did but could not finish it. I had a feeling we could go through. We allow them to make transitions [but] we created a lot.

""So many good things I did not see in the past. The relationship between the players, our captain [Bernardo Silva] helped a lot and the standards with staff.

""I felt we were happy here, the training sessions have been really good but the level of this competition is the World Cup.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Lautaro Martínez challenged those not fully committed to Inter to leave the club in a furious rant following his side's surprise elimination from the Club World Cup.

Having fallen so painfully to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League final just one month ago, Inter were stunned by Fluminense in the last 16 of the Club World Cup, falling to a 2–0 defeat over which the Nerazzurri can have no complaints.

Fronting up to the media after the final whistle, club captain Lautaro did not hold back as he took aim at some players in the squad for an alleged lack of commitment to the team.

“This was a last objective with the little strength we had left, we put our heart into it, I'm so sorry, I never want to lose,” he told reporters.

“But I want to say that you have to want to be here. We are fighting for certain objectives, those who want to be here, stay, those who don't can leave. I saw things that I didn't like. I want to fight to win because we are in an important team, a team that we have brought back to the top and we must continue to do this.

“Who am I referring to? Everyone in general. You can't do things alone. I am the first responsible as captain, now I apologise to the fans, because another defeat hurts a lot. We gave everything and we got this far.”

While Lautaro declined to name the target, or targets, of his rant, Inter president Beppe Marotta publicly suggested the captain's words were aimed at midfielder Hakan Çalhanoğlu, a known target for Turkish side Galatasaray.

“I interpret the captain's words in a positive way,” Marotta revealed to DAZN. “He was referring to an important concept, when a player no longer wants to be in a team, it's right that he leaves.

“There is no one who has concretely expressed this situation. Perhaps he was referring to Çalhanoğlu's dynamics, the situation will be defined soon, calmly and lucidly. We will talk to each other to resolve the problems, Lautaro's call is shared by the club because this is the spirit that can take us far.”

New manager Cristian Chivu attempted to take more of a diplomatic approach, pleading for calm in the aftermath of Inter's elimination.

“Lautaro, like us, is competitive,” Chivu added. “He has a crazy desire to win and to do everything to achieve his goals, his competitiveness has come out.

“Let's not add fuel to the fire, let's take the good things, a new coach with his staff in three weeks has tried to get to know the group, it's not easy to arrive after the disappointment of the end of the season, but I saw people who wanted to give their all, then obviously you can do more. We demand more but you have to be clear-headed to understand why.”

ATLANTA — Inter Miami managing owner Jorge Mas was jovial and upbeat, even in defeat. 

Fellow co-owner David Beckham was subdued. His playing days are long over, but he still suffers defeat as tough as he did as a competitor. 

They both met star Lionel Messi for an embrace outside Inter Miami's locker room for a brief chat, following the club's 4-0 elimination in the Round of 16 of the FIFA Club World Cup to UEFA Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on Sunday, June 29. 

“We rose to the occasion. We gave it our all. And that has to serve us well for what's really important to us, which is what's coming next,” Messi told DSports after the loss.

“Anyway, I'm very happy to have been able to play in this Club World Cup, to have been able to compete, even though, obviously, we're in a different league, a different level, and we can't compete. We played against a team that is coming off a Champions League final win …  and right now, they're the best team in the world, without a doubt. So, it was normal for what happened today to happen.”

What's next for Messi and Inter Miami after being ousted in the tournament?

The first two items on the agenda are exclusive to Messi — the reigning MLS MVP, eight-time Ballon d'Or winner and World Cup champion.

Messi is signed with Inter Miami through the rest of the 2025 MLS season (November or December, depending on the club's run in the MLS Cup playoffs). Mas would love for Messi to extend his stay with the club, at least through next season when Inter Miami opens its new stadium at Miami Freedom Park. He could extend for longer, too. 

Messi must also let the world know whether he will lead Argentina's World Cup defense in the tournament co-hosted in the United States, Canada and Mexico. It would be Messi's sixth World Cup and could be the final act of a legendary career as one of the greatest to ever play the sport. 

One teammate is hopeful Messi re-signs and takes the World Cup stage again, too. 

“Yes, why not? At the end of the day, I don't see him anywhere else, to be honest, but it's his decision,” said Inter Miami's Jordi Alba, who played with Messi in Barcelona. “Ultimately, the decisions he has made have always been the right ones, and obviously I see him competing for the World Cup.”

Messi just finished his second straight summer of elite competition in the U.S. Some rest could be on the way for Messi when Inter Miami continues MLS regular-season play. He experienced some right thigh discomfort during the Club World Cup so maintenance will be needed. At least it won't be a lengthy layoff like last year, when he missed two months with a severe ankle injury he suffered in Argentina's Copa America title win against Colombia last July. 

Does Messi have (at least) one more summer in him? 

Sure, Inter Miami took a tough loss against PSG with the world watching on Sunday, June 29. But they can proudly say it's one of the best 16 clubs in the world after the Club World Cup. That's an accomplishment they can boast with pride. 

Still, it will be difficult to remember their Club World Cup run without thinking about the one game they let slip away.

Inter Miami was so close to winning their group in the tournament. They had a 2-0 lead against Brazilian side Palmerias, but couldn't hang on. They allowed Palmeiras to score twice in the final 10 minutes of the match, settling for a bittersweet draw. They still advanced to the knockout stage, but they ran into a juggernaut in PSG.

Palmeiras advanced past fellow Brazilian side Botafogo 1-0 in extra time during their June 28 round-of-16 match, and will face English Premier League side Chelsea in the quarterfinals.

We will never know if Inter Miami could have beaten Botafogo or had a chance to compete against Chelsea. Even if they beat Palmeiras, it likely would have delayed the inevitability of them being eliminated.

Still, it's something Inter Miami will wonder about.

“We ended up drawing and facing PSG, which was much more complicated, but it's not a criticism. Just a situation that could have been different, because if we had won 2-0, rather than drawing in the last 10 minutes, we wouldn't have been left with that bitter taste,” Messi said. “But anyway, beyond that, I think we competed and now it's over, it's finished and we have to think about what's coming next, our next tournament and nothing else.""

Inter Miami was the first MLS team to face a reigning Champions League winner. They carried the flag for MLS in the tournament, while the Seattle Sounders and Los Angeles FC were bounced during the group stage.

Inter Miami earned the first win by a North American team against a European club in a FIFA competition, defeating FC Porto from Portugal on June 19.

And Inter Miami cleared $21 million of a $1 billion prize pool in the Club World Cup. 

“Our @fifaclubworldcup journey comes to an end. I'm so proud of the players, the staff and the fans for all we have achieved together these last few weeks,” Beckham wrote in an Instagram post after the game. “We've shown the world what the city of Miami is capable of, performing on the biggest stage against the best.” 

Inter Miami has 18 MLS regular-season matches remaining this season and will begin play later this month in the Leagues Cup tournament, which they won in 2023. 

Inter Miami returns to MLS action on July 5 in Montreal, then July 9 in New England. They've got six league matches to play before Leagues Cup begins on July 30. 

“It serves us well,” Inter Miami goalkeeper Oscar Ustari said. “We have to turn the page, obviously … but we mustn't forget what we've achieved.” 

Added Alba: “We can compete against anyone … if we stay focused and keep this desire in the MLS, we'll have a lot of chances to win.” 

Inter Miami might be sixth in the MLS Eastern Conference standings and 10th for MLS's Supporters' Shield, which they won last season. But Inter Miami will continue to be a favorite to win MLS Cup later this year — especially after their Club World Cup performance. 

Inter Miami has won two titles since Messi joined the club in July 2023. Their pursuit to win the Concacaf Champions Cup failed earlier this year. Their aspirations to make a statement in the Club World Cup was a success. 

Another Leagues Cup title would be an accomplishment. 

Winning MLS Cup would further validate Inter Miami's Messi experience, beyond the impact he's already made playing in the U.S. for the last two years. 

“We did our best and that has to serve us for what is really important, which is what is coming,” Messi said. “Very happy to have been able to play this Club World Cup, to have been able to compete beyond the fact that we are in another league and at another level.”

Chelsea find themselves just three games away from the ultimate prize of winning the Club World Cup over in the United States.

The Blues face a showdown with Estevao Willian and Palmeiras in the quarter-finals after their dramatic Round of 16 victory against Benfica.

They will be hoping to have a new player in their ranks ahead of the next game. Chelsea want Joao Pedro in their Club World Cup squad as they prepare to add him to the club.

The club have put themselves on the better side of the draw on paper despite finishing second in their group, and that route was made even easier after Thiago Silva helped eliminate Inter Milan.

They missed out on top spot in Group D after defeat to Flamengo in their second game, and the Brazilian side were not shy to let their opponents know they had won.

Easy win against London Blue! 🐜 pic.twitter.com/PfGtQbzljC

Topping the group saw Flamengo set up a Round of 16 tie with Bayern Munich, which saw them eliminated from the competition.

As Chelsea prepare for their own quarter-final tie, they made a reference to Flamengo's jibe at the Blues by returning the favour.

They said: “London Blue's quarter-final tie” in reference to the disrespectful way they were referred to by the Brazilian club.

As the competition opens up for the Blues, they can now start to believe in their chances of winning the whole thing, and the astronomical prize money that they will receive as a result.

Chelsea's post-season campaign in the United States may not be ideal preparation for the upcoming Premier League season, the financial rewards have already proven great.

Just one win in the competition provided enough prize money to cover Andrey Santos' salary for 100 weeks.

Up to now, the Blues have earned close to £40m, a figure which is closing in on the price tag they have paid for Pedro or Jamie Gittens.

There is a serious chance to add to that in the next 10 days, which could encourage the Blues to continue to do business.","{'href': 'https://www.thechelseachronicle.com', 'title': 'The Chelsea Chronicle'}","soccer"

FIFA Club World Cup

Al Hilal eliminated Manchester City from the Club World Cup in a landmark victory for the Saudi Arabian team, winning a remarkable last-16 game 4-3 in extra time to cap a day of upsets.

The Saudi side have shopped significantly for European stars since the state's Public Investment Fund (PIF) took control of four teams in the Saudi Pro League in 2023 as part of its global sports push.

Saudi Arabia will host the World Cup in 2034 and the sports investment arm of PIF invested a reported $1billion (£750m) in DAZN, the broadcaster that bought the rights to the Club World Cup for the same amount from FIFA, which in turn has offered an overall prize pot of $1bn for this competition.

Simone Inzaghi's Al Hilal have now banked a further $13.7m of that fund and could earn more when they face Fluminense back at the Camping World Stadium in Orlando in a quarter-final on Friday.

The game evoked the chaotic Champions League semi-finals contested when Inzaghi was at Inter towards the end of the domestic season, with drama and quality laced throughout.

Al Hilal were furious about City's opening goal and at first refused to kick off after the ball appeared to strike the right arm of Rayan Ait-Nouri and then the upper-left arm of Ilkay Gundogan before Bernardo Silva bundled it in. Both players appeared to have their arms in a natural position and neither moved their arms towards the ball, but the protests meant it was almost four minutes before the game resumed, with referee Jesus Valenzuela publicly confirming his decision over the stadium PA.

If that was dramatic, the second half was manic, with Marcos Leonardo equalising 41 seconds after the break following a brilliant run by Malcom, who then put Al Hilal 2-1 up on 52 minutes when he ran through from halfway after a superb Joao Cancelo through ball.

Erling Haaland equalised a few minutes later and Malcom was then awarded a penalty, only to be flagged offside. Mohamed Kanno missed a great chance to win it for Al Hilal before substitute Ali Lajami acrobatically cleared Haaland's 84th-minute header off the line to send the game to extra time.

It was Pep Guardiola's turn to run onto the pitch to fume at referee Valenzuela after he blew for full time in regular time, despite Jeremy Doku being hacked down driving a dangerous attack.



Guardiola had barely calmed down when Kalidou Koulibaly headed in a corner from another former Premier League player, Ruben Neves, but substitute Phil Foden levelled the game again at 3-3 at the end of the first half of stoppage time.

Ederson produced a brilliant reflex save to keep out a Sergej Milinkovic-Savic header but the ball fell to Leonardo, who bundled in the winner in the 112th minute.

Here, The Athletic's Jordan Campbell, Mark Carey, Sam Lee and Oliver Kay analyse a remarkable game.

City's money men had budgeted for a quarter-final appearance at the Club World Cup, so in a financial sense, their surprise elimination at the last-16 stage means they have fallen short of expectations.

City will miss out on $13.7m, leaving Guardiola's side collecting an estimated $51.7m from the tournament.

On a football side, it is a reality check for a team that has already made big strides forward after struggling last season. There has been a fresh atmosphere around the club thanks to the new signings and backroom staff changes, but those factors could not propel them towards a serious run at the Club World Cup crown and the finances that come with it.

After beating Juventus 5-2 and the first half against Al Hilal, they had been warming up very nicely, but suddenly, they find themselves out. With six weeks to go until the Premier League season starts, the early finish does allow the players a chance to rest up and train properly before the big kick-off. It could be a blessing in disguise but they would have been hoping to win this tournament.

“It has been an incredible journey, we have been so good here,” manager Guardiola said afterwards. “The vibe of the players and the staff has been so good. It's a pity that we are out. Football is like this. We tried until the end.

“We knew it was a good team with top quality. All of them have been playing in Europe for many years with a lot of quality. Today, we were really, really good in general.”

Sam Lee

It is hard to gauge the importance of matches at this tournament but this has to be seen as an enormous result and occasion for Al Hilal, Saudi Arabia and Asian football — not to mention a significant boost to the Club World Cup as a competition.

Nobody should imagine that this was Manchester City at the peak of their powers. Guardiola's side were coming off the back of their worst campaign in years and trying to balance the fitness demands of being between two seasons, but Al Hilal were excellent, producing a disciplined, incisive counter-attacking display that will have delighted Inzaghi, their new coach.

To have a club from the Middle East in the quarter-finals, as well as two from Brazil, can help this tournament grow. Al Hilal are unbeaten in the United States this summer and have been one of the most impressive teams at the tournament.

Beyond that, it was an enthralling game of the type the tournament needs. Following Fluminense's victory over Inter, this felt like a positive day for the Club World Cup, with the focus on the pitch rather than heat, storms and empty seats.

Oliver Kay

City should not have been surprised by what followed when Neves prepared himself to whip in a corner at the start of extra time.

The Portugal international spent years at Wolverhampton Wanderers and City will have had multiple reminders of the technical quality he possesses from dead balls. The player on the end of Neves's dangerous delivery? Former Chelsea defender Koulibaly, who remains an imposing figure from set plays when making the march upfield from centre-back.

Neves and Koulibaly made the move from the Premier League to the Saudi Pro League in the summer of 2023 during Al Hilal's spending spree, with the pair becoming mainstays of the side. Six months later, Neves admitted that finances were at the heart of his decision but that he was also keen to build football in Saudi Arabia.

“One of the things is the money,” Neves told BBC Sport. “You cannot hide that. But when we see the project — and I know a lot of people think we say this because just to say it, but it's not true.”

From the performances both players put in against City — particularly Neves as a central centre-back within Inzaghi's back five — there is little doubt that their quality remains as high as ever, with their link-up for Al Hilal's third goal being a timely reminder to Guardiola.

Mark Carey

Valenzuela, the referee, pointed to the centre circle and ordered Al Hilal to restart the game, but the Saudi team refused.

They were incensed that the referee had allowed City's goal to stand after seeing a replay on the screen, which appeared to show the ball hitting Ait-Nouri's arm, even though it was bent and tucked into his body as he ran onto the ball.

The video assistant referee (VAR) did not instruct Valenzuela to go to the monitor but Al Hilal's players surrounded him and refused to accept his decision, continuing to argue their case.

Even when he blew his whistle, waved them away and continued pointing to the spot to signal that Bernardo's goal had stood, two players did not concede and remained in City's half of the pitch.

This is how it all unfolded.

First, a clipped ball through catches Ait-Nouri on the arm as he runs into the box.



Then, when the ball rebounds from his cross, it strikes Gundogan on his upper arm and is then poked in by Bernardo.



As City celebrated, several Al Hilal players, including Neves, made their case that it should be ruled out for handball.

 

The referee then appeared to ask whether there had been a handball before the goal.



Just over a minute later, and without being sent to the screen, he signalled for the goal.



Al Hilal's players are about to restart the game but after a replay is shown over the big screen, they abandon the kick-off and surround the referee, with goalkeeper Yassine Bounou even coming up.

 

The referee is unmoved and, after more than a minute of protests, announces over the speaker system that his final decision is a goal and points to the centre circle again.

 

Al Hilal are still not happy but, reluctantly, one minute later, they kick off.



When the cooling break was called after half an hour, several of the players took it upon themselves to question the referee once more.

It was a controversial moment but the referee had not ingratiated himself with either team early on as he allowed several heavy tackles and cynical fouls to go without showing a yellow card.

The officials came out early for the second half, standing in the centre circle for several minutes as they awaited both teams. Perhaps they knew that entering through the tunnel at the same time as Al Hilal would likely cop them another earful.

Jordan Campbell

Foden needed a short break away from the sport after struggling with his mental health last season.

If anyone was wondering how quickly he could turn the page and get back to the goalscoring form he was in two seasons ago, then three goals in four games at this tournament, from just one start, is about as emphatic an answer as he could have delivered.

But his exquisite volley in extra time was his best this summer — and had looked to be his most meaningful.

As the ball fell to him, he watched it fall and guided it across goal from a very tight angle to beat Bounou.

Until then, City had been struggling to find any room as Al Hilal built a royal blue wall in their own penalty area but Rayan Cherki procured an inch-perfect clipped cross to the back post that Foden took on first time.

He was the last sub to be sent on after Guardiola brought on Manuel Akanji, Nathan Ake and Rodri after going 2-1 down in the 52nd minute, and then brought on Omar Marmoush and Cherki at the start of extra time.

It was a terrific way to get his 100th goal for the club but it did not count for as much as he had hoped.

Jordan Campbell

It was a surprise when Malcom was taken off just after the hour mark, possibly as a result of a crunching tackle from Ruben Dias. The Brazilian was comfortably Al Hilal's most dangerous attacking player, leaving City shell-shocked from a whirlwind start to the second half.

It was his excellent turn and driving run that kickstarted Al Hilal's attack for the equaliser that stunned City after the break. After laying the ball off to former City wing-back Cancelo, it was Malcom's follow-up effort that eventually fell to Marcos Leonardo to score with a smart headed finish.

Malcom's pace and purpose were on show again just minutes later, as Al Hilal's breakaway goal from a superb Cancelo pass saw him accelerate beyond City's last man and score coolly past Ederson — running from his own defensive box to the attacking box in a few seconds

  

Guardiola's men could not deal with the Brazilian's pace. Malcom spun in behind once more immediately after City had equalised and Dias clattered into him in the box — but Malcom was inches offside.

It was a performance that the 28-year-old will be delighted with, reminding fans that he still has the quality to compete with Europe's best. A short-lived stint at Barcelona in 2018-19 ended with a whimper before the Brazilian resurrected his career at Zenit Saint Petersburg and moved to Saudi Arabia in 2023.

His time on the pitch only lasted 60 minutes, but what an hour it was.

Mark Carey

Yassine Bounou likes international tournaments.

Also known as ‘Bono', the 34-year-old was a crucial member of the Morocco team who got to the semi-finals of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, with crucial penalty shootout saves against Spain placing him firmly into legendary status for his nation.

Bounou showcased his shot-stopping skills to the world once more, creating his own highlights reel within a single game at times. Without him, City could have been out of sight by half-time, but his flicked efforts over the bar, strong one-v-one saves and palmed efforts wide of the post (illustrated in the graphic below) kept his side in it.



It has been a theme of Bounou's tournament in the United States, saving a penalty against Real Madrid's Federico Valverde before keeping back-to-back clean sheets against Red Bull Salzburg and Pachuca during the group stage.

The sample size might be rather small, but he has ‘prevented' three more goals than he should have based on the quality of shots he has faced, keeping his side in the game (quite literally) single-handedly at times.

While Al Hilal's financial might has brought several stars to Saudi Arabia in recent years, their understated goalkeeper — also nicknamed ‘the smiling hero' — is as crucial to Inzaghi as any other outfield player they have on their books.

Using clever tactics and Messi clickbait, Egyptian creators racked up 14m views with highlights posted before kickoff. YouTube didn't catch on until it was too late

This story was reported by Indicator, a publication that investigates digital deception, and co-published with the Guardian.

It was Thursday morning in America and something didn't look right in the highlights of the Club World Cup match between Manchester City and Juventus.

The video in front of me was the top result on both YouTube and Google Search's video tab for the game in Orlando. More than 700,000 people had already watched the best moments of the riveting 3-2 matchup. And yet, footage showed City head coach Pep Guardiola all bundled up in a puffer jacket ill-suited to humid Florida summers.

On a couple of occasions, the commentators on the video referred to the Juventus goalkeeper as Martin Dúbravka. He actually plays for Newcastle, a totally unrelated team that wears a black-and-white jersey similar to that worn by the Italian side.

Oh, also? The match wasn't on until several hours later.

The Club World Cup is the controversial brainchild of Fifa president Gianni Infantino, pitting 32 clubs from around the world in a replica of the World Cup played by national sides. Attendance numbers have been so-so, but the money at stake is huge. Crucially, online interest has been strong. Globally, Google searches for the tournament have dwarfed those for Donald Trump, even on the day the US president announced America would bomb Iran's nuclear facilities.

YouTube has long failed to keep fake highlights and livestreams of football games off its platform. But these have typically been recreated from video games, making them easy to spot as soon as you've opened the video.

Now, a group of gaming creators based in Egypt developed a winning formula that combined repackaged clips from old games, obsessive interest in star players like Lionel Messi, and data voids, to get clicks and ad revenue.

Earlier this year, the Egyptian gaming creator Mohamed Reda started posting highlight reels of the MLS team Inter Miami on his YouTube channel Reda Bow. These videos always promised a “Crazy Hat-Trick” by eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi and atypical score lines like 9-3 or 7-4. Like the Man City v Juventus highlights above, the clips were in reality just medleys of old goals. Reda Bow's fake highlights did increasingly well: videos posted in April got 40,000 to 60,000 views but by June his videos were being seen 300,000 times. Then came the Club World Cup.

Reda and two other Egyptian gaming creators started posting the same templated highlights across several YouTube accounts they managed. They focused on the buzzier games that featured Messi or top European teams like Manchester City and Real Madrid.

Crucially, they posted the fake highlights 24 to 48 hours before the matches started. There was little competition for video content about the game before the game. The channels were also verified and had hundreds of thousands of subscribers. The content was fresh and seemingly authoritative, so Google and YouTube's algorithms ranked it highly. So what if the videos defied not only the time continuum but also basic math by promising a “Messi Hat-Trick” even when Inter Miami had only purportedly scored two goals.

The operation's takeover was absolutely comprehensive – just look at the Google Search video tab results for three CWC matches held last week. Videos from the Egyptian creators appear in the top four slots across every game, each with a slightly different scoreline for games that had yet to be played.

The scheme worked. Collectively, 30-odd videos pushed out by the trio were seen 14m times over two weeks.

All of the channels were monetized and ran ads for everything from Chase and B&H to Grubhub and Spectrum. Ironically, the videos also made money from ads for tickets for Club World Cup matches. (Fifa ignored multiple requests for comment.)

Because no deep dive into scams is complete without some AI garbage, the videos also ran ads for questionable diets fronted by a synthetically edited Oprah Winfrey (and many other AI-generated personas).

The hundreds of comments on the videos fall into two categories. About 40% of users don't appear to recognize the deception and post enthusiastic remarks about Lionel Messi or putdowns of his archnemesis Cristiano Ronaldo.

The remainder call out the fact that the highlights aren't real. One despairing viewer wrote “can't believe 800k+ people clicked on this and the game has not happened yet.“ My personal favorite is a user who wrote “You are very good at making hundreds of thousands or millions of moths come to watch.” (I'm assuming it sounds even better in the original Thai.)

All of the videos in this scheme included a few minutes at the end that showed the channel owner playing a video game like eFootball.

After the games falsely represented in the videos were played, the creators updated the title to the actual score. When view growth started slowing down because interest in the game faded, they trimmed the entire highlights element out of the video and left only the final clip of them playing the video game. This bait-and-switch served to both drive ad revenue and juice up historical numbers on the channel for newcomers.

I reached out to YouTube about the videos and was acknowledged on Friday. By that evening, the platform had removed all videos under its policies against spam, deceptive practices and scams. It also terminated all the channels involved but by the time of publication had not gotten back to me on the motivation. At least one fake highlight reel with almost 1m views was still live, however.

The fake highlights scheme was juicy enough that several other YouTube channels got in on the fun, scraping the Egyptians' fake highlights or making some of their own. (Some of this stuff also made it on TikTok, collecting millions of views there.)

The videos appear on channels whose purpose is entirely unrelated to football – including cooking, fishing, farming and bird breeding channels. I assume these are old accounts taken over by a scam operation, but I haven't had time to dig any further. Here are some pigeon videos in case that's your thing.

The stakes here appear lower than the average Indicator story about deceptive behavior online. Viewers who fell for these videos may have been a little disappointed to realize what happened. At a stretch, some may have even gambled one way or another based on the videos.

But if a user didn't know what time the game was on, failed to recognize the outdated spliced clips, and went on to comment “MESSI” underneath the videos, they probably weren't in the market for sophisticated football analysis anyway.

YouTube and its advertisers definitely lost some money from this deceptive operation, but it's hard to feel too bad for either of them.

What matters here is less the fake content itself than the behavioral deception that enabled it to succeed.

On one of the most searched topics of the moment, a group of young YouTube creators were able to outwit Google's ranking and moderation and surge to the top of results. By trimming videos after publication, they also showed the vulnerability of a functionality that can very easily be abused for more nefarious purposes – for instance, posting incendiary remarks to drive referral traffic from other platforms then trim them out in time to avoid getting flagged for any policy violation.

For what it's worth, Manchester City actually trounced Juventus 5-2.

ATLANTA — Inter Miami managing owner Jorge Mas was jovial and upbeat, even in defeat. 

Fellow co-owner David Beckham was subdued. His playing days are long over, but he still suffers defeat as tough as he did as a competitor. 

They both met star Lionel Messi for an embrace outside Inter Miami's locker room for a brief chat, following the club's 4-0 elimination in the Round of 16 of the FIFA Club World Cup to UEFA Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on Sunday, June 29. 

“We rose to the occasion. We gave it our all. And that has to serve us well for what's really important to us, which is what's coming next,” Messi told DSports after the loss.

“Anyway, I'm very happy to have been able to play in this Club World Cup, to have been able to compete, even though, obviously, we're in a different league, a different level, and we can't compete. We played against a team that is coming off a Champions League final win …  and right now, they're the best team in the world, without a doubt. So, it was normal for what happened today to happen.”

What's next for Messi and Inter Miami after being ousted in the tournament?

The first two items on the agenda are exclusive to Messi — the reigning MLS MVP, eight-time Ballon d'Or winner and World Cup champion.

Messi is signed with Inter Miami through the rest of the 2025 MLS season (November or December, depending on the club's run in the MLS Cup playoffs). Mas would love for Messi to extend his stay with the club, at least through next season when Inter Miami opens its new stadium at Miami Freedom Park. He could extend for longer, too. 

Messi must also let the world know whether he will lead Argentina's World Cup defense in the tournament co-hosted in the United States, Canada and Mexico. It would be Messi's sixth World Cup and could be the final act of a legendary career as one of the greatest to ever play the sport. 

One teammate is hopeful Messi re-signs and takes the World Cup stage again, too. 

“Yes, why not? At the end of the day, I don't see him anywhere else, to be honest, but it's his decision,” said Inter Miami's Jordi Alba, who played with Messi in Barcelona. “Ultimately, the decisions he has made have always been the right ones, and obviously I see him competing for the World Cup.”

Messi just finished his second straight summer of elite competition in the U.S. Some rest could be on the way for Messi when Inter Miami continues MLS regular-season play. He experienced some right thigh discomfort during the Club World Cup so maintenance will be needed. At least it won't be a lengthy layoff like last year, when he missed two months with a severe ankle injury he suffered in Argentina's Copa America title win against Colombia last July. 

Does Messi have (at least) one more summer in him? 

Sure, Inter Miami took a tough loss against PSG with the world watching on Sunday, June 29. But they can proudly say it's one of the best 16 clubs in the world after the Club World Cup. That's an accomplishment they can boast with pride. 

Still, it will be difficult to remember their Club World Cup run without thinking about the one game they let slip away.

Inter Miami was so close to winning their group in the tournament. They had a 2-0 lead against Brazilian side Palmerias, but couldn't hang on. They allowed Palmeiras to score twice in the final 10 minutes of the match, settling for a bittersweet draw. They still advanced to the knockout stage, but they ran into a juggernaut in PSG.

Palmeiras advanced past fellow Brazilian side Botafogo 1-0 in extra time during their June 28 round-of-16 match, and will face English Premier League side Chelsea in the quarterfinals.

We will never know if Inter Miami could have beaten Botafogo or had a chance to compete against Chelsea. Even if they beat Palmeiras, it likely would have delayed the inevitability of them being eliminated.

Still, it's something Inter Miami will wonder about.

“We ended up drawing and facing PSG, which was much more complicated, but it's not a criticism. Just a situation that could have been different, because if we had won 2-0, rather than drawing in the last 10 minutes, we wouldn't have been left with that bitter taste,” Messi said. “But anyway, beyond that, I think we competed and now it's over, it's finished and we have to think about what's coming next, our next tournament and nothing else.""

Inter Miami was the first MLS team to face a reigning Champions League winner. They carried the flag for MLS in the tournament, while the Seattle Sounders and Los Angeles FC were bounced during the group stage.

Inter Miami earned the first win by a North American team against a European club in a FIFA competition, defeating FC Porto from Portugal on June 19.

And Inter Miami cleared $21 million of a $1 billion prize pool in the Club World Cup. 

“Our @fifaclubworldcup journey comes to an end. I'm so proud of the players, the staff and the fans for all we have achieved together these last few weeks,” Beckham wrote in an Instagram post after the game. “We've shown the world what the city of Miami is capable of, performing on the biggest stage against the best.” 

Inter Miami has 18 MLS regular-season matches remaining this season and will begin play later this month in the Leagues Cup tournament, which they won in 2023. 

Inter Miami returns to MLS action on July 5 in Montreal, then July 9 in New England. They've got six league matches to play before Leagues Cup begins on July 30. 

“It serves us well,” Inter Miami goalkeeper Oscar Ustari said. “We have to turn the page, obviously … but we mustn't forget what we've achieved.” 

Added Alba: “We can compete against anyone … if we stay focused and keep this desire in the MLS, we'll have a lot of chances to win.” 

Inter Miami might be sixth in the MLS Eastern Conference standings and 10th for MLS's Supporters' Shield, which they won last season. But Inter Miami will continue to be a favorite to win MLS Cup later this year — especially after their Club World Cup performance. 

Inter Miami has won two titles since Messi joined the club in July 2023. Their pursuit to win the Concacaf Champions Cup failed earlier this year. Their aspirations to make a statement in the Club World Cup was a success. 

Another Leagues Cup title would be an accomplishment. 

Winning MLS Cup would further validate Inter Miami's Messi experience, beyond the impact he's already made playing in the U.S. for the last two years. 

“We did our best and that has to serve us for what is really important, which is what is coming,” Messi said. “Very happy to have been able to play this Club World Cup, to have been able to compete beyond the fact that we are in another league and at another level.”

MIAMI GARDENS, FLA. (WSVN) - President Trump's immigration enforcement policies are sparking World Cup concerns in South Florida, causing activists to speak out.

During a press conference on Monday, activists said fans who will be attending the games will come from all over the world and instead of getting a welcome mat being rolled out for them, they are concerned they will be asked for their papers.

They added they want to see FIFA and Miami Dade County's mayor use whatever influence they have to try to ease off on those immigration concerns.

“Our ask is for FIFA to pressure, for there to be no immigration enforcement during the games,” said Yareliz Mendez-Zamora of the American Friends Service Committee. “No Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence at the games.”

The activists said ICE providing security at the ongoing FIFA Club World Cup could be scaring fans off and they want to prevent the same thing from happening to next year's FIFA World Cup games at Hard Rock Stadium.

Activists say ICE entering into agreements to work with the police and local municipalities like Doral and Miami and on FIU's campus, the allure of the international event could be tainted by fear.

Customs and Border Protection posted on social media earlier this month, saying “CBP will be suited and booted ready to provide security for the first round of games.”

Earlier this month, agents with CBP and the U.S. Coast Guard boarded a boat chartered by a Spanish-language news network, asking the boat and catering crews to provide proof of their legal status. The mayors of Miami and Miami Dade County were also on board.

“If even elected officials and high-profile media outlets aren't immune to ICE and CBP overreach, how can regular working families feel safe attending a soccer match?” said Paul Christian Namphy of the Family Action Network Movement.

Miami-Dade County gave $46 million in the form of subsidies to FIFA. Documentary filmmaker, Billy Corbin says that amounts to an investment by taxpayers when other areas of the county budget may be strained.

“Let me be clear, they're coming here to see the World Cup, not to see Alligator Alcatraz,” said Corbin, “So, FIFA, please protect your fans.”

The concerns among activists extend beyond South Florida. The Los Angeles Dodgers denied stadium access to ICE agents on June 20th. The Dodgers later pledged $1 million to support immigrant families who have been impacted by President Trump's pledge to step up deportations of undocumented migrants.

Activists said they reached out to FIFA and have not received a response about whether they will protect fans in the way they would like to see it.

The FIFA Club World Cup quarterfinals feature some of the best teams in the world and some of the best stories of the summer tournament.

On the other hand, rejoice fans! There's only one more late kick-off this tournament. After July 4, all games will kick off at 4 p.m. ET (9 p.m. BST) the latest. After July 5, all games will kick off at 3 p.m. ET (8 p.m. BST), similar times to Champions League games during a season.

Here's quarterfinal game at the FIFA Club World Cup.

Here are all the confirmed matchups for the next stage of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup:

Saturday, July 5

PSG vs. Bayern is going to steal headlines for must-watch fixture, but Real Madrid vs. Borussia Dortmund, if it comes to fruition, has the potential as well given both are European final rematches this decade. 

Both remaining Brazilian sides look to continue their special runs against some of the Premier League's best. Fluminense, after eliminating Inter, must face Al Hilal. A duel between two sides that pulled off major upsets in the round of 16. While some had their eyes on an all-Premier League semifinal, Chelsea are now the only English team left in the tournament. They face Palmeiras in the next round after a hectic win against Benfica that featured extra time and a near two-hour rain delay.

The tournament is heating up as we near the final on July 13 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford.

There's a fresh secret behind football's most prized silverware. FIFA has let the cat out of the bag regarding the Club World Cup trophy, and it's not what fans or even players might expect. The real story behind the trek of the trophy has transformed how sports champions celebrate and what they can actually put in their trophy room.

Football fans have been seeing the winning team holding the gleaming Club World Cup trophy up high in a shower of confetti for years. Few know that this is fleeting in more than one sense. FIFA's “secret” – and Marca has let the cat out of the bag on it – is that the actual trophy is only awarded to the winners as part of the after-game celebratory game. On shutdown, FIFA receives the actual trophy, and the club keeps a replica.

Marca describes, “the winning side only gets to keep the debut trophy to celebrate with on the last.” The remainder of the year, it is in the care of FIFA, stored and preserved.

By limiting the availability of the original, FIFA guarantees that the mystique and integrity of the trophy are preserved. The replica the club holds is extremely hard to tell apart in looks, but it's not the same piece of history that's been owned by world champions everywhere. In that way, the history of the trophy is preserved, and another layer of exclusivity is bestowed upon the victory.

Goal.com details the nuances of the design of the Club World Cup trophy and how replicas are made. The replica is produced to the same technical specifications as the real one, but secretly engraved and officially classified as a replica. It means the club gets to display it in their trophy case, but the actual one is not available.

The article reports: “Clubs are awarded with a copy trophy to retain, the original being retained by FIFA.”

It is a bit different from some of the other big competitions, such as the FIFA World Cup, where the business organizing it gets to retain the actual trophy. The copy is a symbol of victory that the supporters and team players value, but since the actual one only remains in their hands for a short time, the enjoyment is a bit bittersweet.

To hold briefly in one's hand the original trophy is to make all the sweeter for memory. The prize itself is theirs for the duration of an instant, and the richer for it. And a reminder that the delight of the victory is transient and everlasting—one in the fleeting moment of transience, and then in possession of the next generation of heroes.

The company's operation involves making every victory under the company special and unique in trophy lore. To the sportsman himself, the replica is everywhere, in his head, it is present, reminding him of the trophy, but it is the pride of having been given the original on the highest podium in sports.

The following you glance over and see a line of players standing up straight with the Club World Cup trophy held high in victory, bear this in mind: the trophy itself is theirs only briefly before it will lie safely ensconced in the safe at the FIFA headquarters. The prize itself is theirs for the duration of an instant, and the richer for it.

Club World Cup holders and European giants Man City are dumped out by Saudi Pro League champions in a seven-goal thriller after extra time in Orlando.

Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal have sent English giants Manchester City crashing out of the Club World Cup, snatching a shock 4-3 victory in extra time in the biggest upset of the tournament so far.

The match finished 2-2 at full-time on Monday, but at the end of an eventful extra-time, Marcos Leonardo grabbed the winner and pulled off one of the greatest wins in Middle Eastern football history.

The Saudi club now advance to the quarterfinals, where they will face Brazilian club Fluminense, ensuring a non-European team will reach the last four.

Man City had taken the lead in the ninth minute in controversial fashion, with Bernardo Silva finishing after Rayan Ait-Nouri's cross.

Al Hilal players protested that Ait-Nouri had controlled with his arm in the build-up, but the goal stood.

Man City had plenty of opportunities to extend their lead before the break, but a combination of poor finishing and inspired goalkeeping from Moroccan goalkeeper Yassine Bounou kept the lead at a single goal.

Al Hilal offered several reminders of their threat on the break but Man City had even more chances, with Jeremy Doku volleying straight at Bounou, who moments later reacted superbly again to keep out a Bernardo effort.

The question as to whether Man City would live to regret not converting those chances was answered within a minute of the resumption.

Former City full-back Joao Cancelo's low cross was parried out by Ederson. Malcolm pounced but saw his shot blocked by Ruben Dias, only for the ball to loop to Marcos Leonardo to head home the equaliser.

Six minutes later, and City's high defensive line was exposed by a long ball from Cancelo, which Brazilian Malcolm raced onto, showing power and pace as he broke away before coolly slotting past Ederson.

The Saudi fans in the crowd went wild while City manager Pep Guardiola responded immediately with a triple substitution, with midfielder Rodri and defenders Nathan Ake and Manuel Akanji introduced.

That brought some much-needed stability to a shaky back line but City needed improvement at the other end too, and it came, albeit in scruffy circumstances.

The Al Hilal defence were unable to deal with a Bernardo corner and Haaland pounced to steer home the loose ball and make it 2-2.

City piled on the pressure as they looked for the winner but yet again Bounou proved their nemesis as he denied Akanji and Ruben Dias, and even when he was beaten by Haaland, substitute Ali Lajami produced a magnificent goal-line clearance.

Guardiola took off Haaland and introduced Egyptian forward Omar Marmoush as the game went into extra time.

But for all City's depth, Al Hilal had a deep well of spirit to draw upon. Just four minutes into the opening period, Al Hilal regained the lead when Kalidou Koulibaly rose superbly to meet a Ruben Neves corner with a brilliantly angled header.

City responded with a goal of real quality when Rayan Cherki's brilliantly floated ball towards the back post was poked home masterfully by Phil Foden, at full stretch and from the tightest of angles.

But incredibly, Al Hilal responded again to restore their lead: Sergej Milinkovic-Savic's header was saved by Ederson but Marcos Leonardo followed in to bundle the ball over the line.

As the celebrating Al Hilal fans poured out of the stadium, the Brazilian striker let his emotions pour out, too.

“I've had a difficult time in the last two months. My mother spent 70 days in the ICU,” he said.

“Today, she's fine, thank God. When I scored those two goals, I thought of her. She was able to watch the match.”

City skipper Bernardo Silva said his team had paid the price for being unable to deal with Al Hilal's counter-attacking.

“We scored three and could've scored five, six. It was all about controlling when we lost the ball, controlling the transitions, don't let them run, and they ran way too many times,” he said.

“With one, two passes, there was always a feeling of danger coming from them. When we allow teams to run like this, we always suffer a lot, and today was the case,” he said.

With the FIFA Club World Cup about to wrap up its time in Atlanta, have local businesses seen a boost in customers?

Some say they definitely have, but the city may not have seen a business boom from the tournament of high-profile club teams to the level initially expected.

And Club World Cup will likely end up being a much smaller dry run compared to the crowds expected next summer when Atlanta holds eight matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup. 

This summer, Mercedes-Benz Stadium has been one of 12 venues across 11 cities to host the 63 matches of the Club World Cup. 

While the six Club World Cup matches held in Atlanta were not expected to draw international crowds on the scale of next year, some out-of-staters were expected to travel in for a chance to see crowd favorites such as Chelsea FC and Manchester City.

The first Club World Cup match at MBS, which featured Chelsea, had the worst soccer attendance the stadium has seen outside of the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 22,000 of the 71,000 seats were filled. Average attendance across the first four matches came in less than 40,000.



The Reverb Downtown Atlanta hotel, which sits across Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard from the stadium, saw a significant increase in business from the matches so far.

“We have definitely had a huge difference, which is wonderful,” said sales manager Jacqueline Bassett.

MARTA ridership reflected this relative lack of attendance compared to an Atlanta United match. While a regular Atlanta United match averages about 17,000 individual round-trip MARTA riders, the four Club World Cup matches so far have ranged from about 5,500 to almost 11,700 individual riders, according to MARTA spokesperson Stephany Fisher.

Thousands of tickets — as low as $97 after prices were slashed because of lack of demand — were still for sale just two hours before the start of Atlanta's second match between Inter Miami and FC Porto, featuring soccer superstar Lionel Messi.

In the days leading up to Atlanta's first of two matches in the round of 16, the lowest price available was $160 per ticket. While that normally wouldn't be considered a bad price for a matchup of this caliber — Paris Saint-Germain, the recent Champions League winners, versus Inter Miami — it was still a steep ask for trying to fill seats and overcome the attendance issues for an event FIFA spent $50 million promoting, according to The Athletic.

Some fans traveled for matches. The Atlanta Blues, Chelsea's local fan club chapter, played host to events that saw visitors from Los Angeles, Nashville, New York, Philadelphia and even Chelsea's home of England. Even the most loyal fans from the chapter, however, noted that the high ticket prices have contributed to low attendance at matches across the country.

According to an email from Delta Air Lines spokesperson Chelsea Wollerson, there was “nothing notable” in terms of ticket sales to Atlanta during the Club World Cup period. 

Some restaurants in the vicinity of the stadium also said they have noticed a jump in business on match days. The Food Shoppe on Luckie Street has also noticed increased business, especially from out-of-towners, on match days, according to employee Monique Fortune.

But other restaurateurs, who declined to be named, said matchday crowds were a little disappointing. 

“This is a new tournament, and we weren't sure what to expect, but we are happy with the event, our guests are having a great experience that that's what matters most to us,” Heather Sautter, vice president of corporate and marketing communications for Mercedes-Benz Stadium, said in an email to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Before the first match Club World Cup match at MBS, William Pate, president and CEO of the Atlanta Convention & Visitors Bureau, said the following in a statement to the AJC: “The opportunity to host six FIFA Club World Cup matches over three weeks will drive incremental visitation during our typical summer business expectations and will increase the city's international exposure among soccer fans across the world as we prepare to host next year's FIFA World Cup.”

With their summer spending set to exceed £200m, Chelsea are getting some smart business done before tackling a gruelling 2025-26 season

For the last two decades, Chelsea have sought to dominate the transfer market one way or another. When Roman Abramovich rocked up at Stamford Bridge in 2003, he immediately dropped £120 million - roughly £220m in today's money with inflation taken into account - on new players, catapulting the Blues from mere top-four contenders into an elite class capable of winning the Premier League and Champions League. Even despite being banned from spending for two windows from 2019 to 2020, the west London club have still forked out upwards of £2bn since.

In the BlueCo era, Chelsea have continued to splash the cash, though on younger talent rather than proven superstars, ditching their Galactico-lite policy for one more resembling an expensive Brighton. After three years in the wilderness of transition, they have started to show signs of consistent improvement and re-established themselves as an exciting team with the potential to challenge for major honours.

After already acquiring Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Liam Delap in the first mini-window of June, Borussia Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens and versatile Brighton attacker Joao Pedro are set to be next in through the Cobham doors. Again, Chelsea's prolific spending has been questioned, but there is a little more method behind their madness this time around.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Cityzens are heading home from the tournament far earlier than expected after paying a heavy price for their wasted chances against Al-Hilal

In the words of chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak, Manchester City viewed the Club World Cup as ""a very, very serious competition"", and they were going there to win it. The team's ruthless performances in the group stage showed he meant it, too. But after an enthralling 120 minutes against Al-Hilal in the last 16, City are already heading back to Manchester, digesting a chastening and embarrassing elimination from the tournament.

Make no mistake about it, City crashing out in the first round of the knockout stage to a team from outside of Europe is a massive, massive shock and a huge disappointment. Khaldoon and his fellow executives will also be cursing their early elimination both in naked financial terms and for the damage it does to their reputation of being the best team on the planet.

The tournament was supposed to be a fresh start for City after a terrible 2024-25 season as they aimed to avenge their rare trophy-less campaign. However, they were given an important reminder that Pep Guardiola's rebuild is far from complete and that it will take more time and likely even more money spent in the transfer market to give the coach the team he wants to wrestle back the Premier League crown they surrendered to Liverpool last season.

Yet there are some silver linings from City's two-week stay in the United States, and while the wounds of their elimination will take some time to heal, they might well look back upon this tournament as the first step towards re-establishing their dominance of English football.

The Saudi Pro League side provided the upset of the tournament to bounce one of the competition's favorites in the Round of 16 

Al Hilal dealt the first major upset of the Club World Cup, bouncing Manchester City from the competition in the last 16 after an enthralling back-and-forth encounter. The Cityzens weren't clinical enough in attack, and far too easily exploited on the break, and were deservedly sent home by a 4-3 extra-time defeat.

City took the lead inside 10 minutes - albeit in controversial circumstances. The referee waved off not one but two decent shouts for handball in the build up, a move that ended with Bernardo Silva poking home from close range. Al Hilal responded well. New manager Simeone Inzhagi's setup allowed the Saudi Pro League side to hit on the counter-attack, but they lacked an incisive edge in front of goal with Alex Mitrovic out.

They were more clinical in the second half, though. Marcos Leonardo grabbed the equalizer soon after the break with a tidy header after a City defensive breakdown. Malcolm - by some distance Al Hilal's best player on the night - scored the second with a scamper and finish past a stranded Ederson.

But City responded. Erling Haaland grabbed the goal, reacting first to a loose ball in the box and smashing it into the net. Both sides exchanged blows in the ensuing minutes. Jeremy Doku nodded over. Mohamed Kanno whiffed entirely on a wide-open header. Haaland came closest on 85 minutes, forcing a dramatic hooked clearance off the line with his angled effort from close range.

Extra time was eventually needed to decide things. And Al Hilal struck first. Kalidou Koulibaly provided the first punch, rising between two City defenders to meet a corner and give his side a 3-2 lead. City stayed in it, though, and equalized after Phil Foden steered an angled cross into the net. The Saudi Pro League side had the last laugh, Leonardo completing his brace after reacting first to a loose ball to bundle the game over the line in the 112th minute. This tournament has its first major casualty.

Susan Mullane-Imagn Images.
Pictured: Jay Clarke.

The first round of Wimbledon continues on Tuesday, July 1.

For Day 2 from the All England Club, I have Wimbledon predictions for two ATP matches: Dan Evans vs Jay Clarke and Tomas Martin Etcheverry vs Jack Pinnington Jones.

Continue below for my Wimbledon first-round predictions and the latest Wimbledon odds for Tuesday.

Jay Clarke has been working for a while now to realize his potential at the tour level, so it's almost unbelievable that he's still just 26 years old.

It's just as unbelievable that he's found his way back to Wimbledon for the first time in three years, but given the state of British tennis right now, he was able to secure a wild-card.

At any rate, this isn't a player who's been much of a challenge outside of the ITF level. He's now dropped five straight matches — including two in qualifying for Queen's Club and Eastbourne — and he lacks both the weapons and the consistency to come anywhere close to moving past Dan Evans.

The elder Brit is searching for a bit of magic himself as he nears the end of his career at age 35. With that said, his game has aged well in the past few seasons, given his presence as more of a cerebral player, and now that his body seems to be cooperating with him, the results have been there.

Evans is a prime candidate for grass with prowess on the serve-and-volley and an effective backhand slice that will make his opponent hit a bunch of uncomfortable shots from inside the baseline.

Even if Clarke were feeling comfortable here, he'd still be outclassed, so it's just a bonus that Evans has a distinct edge on this surface against the youngster, who's just 11-35 on grass across all levels.

After taking out the likes of Frances Tiafoe, Miomir Kecmanovic and Tommy Paul in recent weeks, I'm betting on Evans being close to his previous form — which would be good enough to earn him far more respect in the market.

Pick: Evans -6.5 Games (-105 via DraftKings)



He's a bit behind schedule, but now that he's graduated from TCU young Jack Pinnington Jones has finally turned pro and has made it into the Wimbledon draw for the first time in his career.

The 22-year-old Brit has a tantalizing set of skills, and his big power has propelled him to plenty of wins in the last two years on faster hardcourts at the lower levels of the game. Grass has been a learning experience — which is the case for any young player given the short grass schedule — but hailing from Great Britain he's had the benefit of tuning up for Wimbledon a bit longer with five wins in nine matches.

At least two of those grass-court losses came against quality opponents, and his last three matches have all come in three sets versus some more experienced talent. Now, he'll have a golden opportunity to showcase his talent against one of the coldest players on tour, Tomas Martin Etcheverry.

Once ticketed for big things on all surfaces, Etcheverry has seemed to lose sight of what he does best. He added a bunch of pop on his serve and a bit on his forehand, but it's caused him to become erratic and as a result, he's labored through this season with a 17-21 record.

The Argentine has lost his last two matches heading into play here — not counting an exhibition he played a few days ago — and it should be said that despite his strong defense, his game is not really a fit on this surface. He's won just five times in 16 grass matches, and even on clay — his favorite surface — he's been awful this year with an 8-11 record.

Etcheverry is down on confidence, he's missing more than ever, and now he's going to compete with a rising talent in front of a hostile crowd. That's a recipe for disaster.

Pick: Pinnington Jones ML (+160 via DraftKings)

John McEnroe is one of the most recognisable voices in tennis and he is back commentating at Wimbledon this year.

The American, who had a stellar playing career and was the fierce rival of Swedish legend Bjorn Borg, was co-commentating for the BBC for their Monday night Wimbledon coverage.

His outspoken, rambunctious personality is an undeniable draw for tennis fans across the world, following on from his often high-profile playing career.

The seven-time Grand Slam champion, who is an icon in large part due to his ‘you cannot be serious' mantra, weighed in on a discussion that has become commonplace in tennis discourse.

Speaking on Monday evening while co-commentating for the BBC, Nick Mullins asked McEnroe if Alexander Zverev is now the best ATP player around yet to win a Grand Slam.

McEnroe: “I would say yes. You can make an argument that perhaps a Holger Rune you know some of the young bucks, could be, you know.”

Mullins interjected, putting forward Greek player Stefanos Tsitsipas as a possible candidate for the best ATP player yet to win a slam.

Mullins said: “Tsitsipas in his prime. He's not in his prime anymore but maybe Tsitsipas in his prime.”

However, McEnroe replied: “I think Zverev's a little better so I think it's accurate. You know, I'm trying to think over the years who are the best guys not to win it and certainly to me he's right up there at the top of the list.”

McEnroe provided evidence-based analysis for his conclusion, pointing out Zverev's near miss at the 2020 US Open against Dominic Thiem.

McEnroe said: “He served for the match against Dominic Thiem at the (US) Open.”

Thiem beat Zverev in an all-time classic, triumphing 2-6 4-6 6-4 6-3 7-6. 

It is no secret that Alexander Zverev has struggled to make an impact at Wimbledon throughout his playing career, having never made it past the fourth round.

The German, who is seeking an elusive Grand Slam crown, faced off against France's Arthur Rinderknech on Monday night.

The Frenchman proved a tough test for Zverev, snatching the opening set 7-6. However, the German showed his grit and desire, saving four set points to win the second set tiebreak.

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

Gaston – Mensik: 01.07.2025 17:00 CEST
H2H: 0-1

Hugo Gaston has lost three of his last five matches. His last match was at the French Open, where he withdrew from his second-round match against Shelton. So far this season, the Frenchman has not played any competitive matches on grass. His last grass-court match was at Wimbledon last season, where he lost to Muller in the opening round in straight sets.

Jakub Mensik has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Eastbourne, Mensik lost against Davidovich Fokina in the quarterfinals in straight sets. Last season at Wimbledon, Mensik lost against Bublik in the opening round in five tight sets.

According to the bookies, Gaston is the big underdog in this matchup, and we agree. The Frenchman has never succeeded on grass courts and is coming into this matchup without any preparation matches. On the other hand, Mensik plays his best tennis, and we expect him to win comfortably today.

That being said, Mensik covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Jakub Mensik -7.5 games handicap @1.91 @bet365

Hijikata – Goffin: 01.07.2025 17:00 CEST
H2H: 1-2

Rinky Hijikata has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Mallorca, Hijikata lost against Tomic in the opening round in three tight sets. Last season at Wimbledon, the Australian lost against Cobolli in the opening round.

David Goffin has lost four of his last five matches. Last season at Wimbledon, Goffin lost against Bellucci in the opening round in four sets. So far this season, he has not played any competitive matches on grass.

According to the bookies, Hijikata is the slight favourite in this matchup, and we agree. He is a solid grass-court player and has already played six matches on grass this season. We expect him to be a better player today and win easily.

That being said, Hijikata winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Rinky Hijikata winning @1.53 @bet365

Shelton – Bolt: 01.07.2025 17:00 CEST
H2H: first meeting

Ben Shelton has lost four of his last five matches. Last week in Mallorca, Tien upset him in the 1/8-Finals in straight sets. Last season at Wimbledon, the American lost against Sinner in the 1/8-Finals in straight sets.

Alex Bolt has won four of his last five matches. This week at Wimbledon, Bolt qualified for the main draw tournament. In the final qualifying round, he defeated Landaluce in straight sets easily. Last season at Wimbledon, Bolt lost against Ruud in the opening round in three tight sets.

According to the bookies, Bolt is the underdog in this matchup, but we disagree. He enjoys playing on grass and has played well in the qualifying tournament. On the other hand, Shelton struggled on grass this season. We expect Bolt to keep this match tight.

That being said, Bolt covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Alex Bolt +4.5 games handicap @1.80 @bet365

Giron – Ugo Carabelli: 01.07.2025 16:30 CEST
H2H: first meeting

Marcos Giron has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Eastbourne, Giron lost against Fritz in the quarterfinals in three tight sets. Last season at Wimbledon, he lost against Zverev in the second round in straight sets. He has never made it past the second round here.

Camilo Ugo Carabelli has lost six straight matches. Last week in Mallorca, the Argentine lost against Quinn in the opening round in straight sets. So far this season, Ugo Carabelli has played four grass-court matches and lost all four of them. Last season at Wimbledon, he lost in the opening qualifying round against de Loore in straight sets. This is his debut campaign in the main draw tournament at Wimbledon.

According to the bookies, Giron is the big favourite in this matchup, and we agree. He is a solid grass-court player and has already played several strong matches on grass this season. On the other hand, Ugo Carabelli has been winless for over a month. We expect Giron to dominate and win easily.

That being said, Giron covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Camilo Ugo Carabelli -7.5 games handicap @1.67 @bet365

Etcheverry – Pinnington Jones: 01.07.2025 17:00 CEST
H2H: first meeting

Tomas Martin Etcheverry has won three of his last five matches. Last week in Mallorca, the Argentine lost against Bautista-Agut in the opening round in three tight sets. Last season at Wimbledon, Etcheverry lost against Tsitsipas in the opening round in straight sets.

Jack Pinnington Jones has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Eastbourne, the Brit lost against Borges in the opening round in three tight sets. Last season at Wimbledon, he failed to qualify for the main draw tournament. He has been granted a wild card this week.

According to the bookies, Etcheverry is the favourite in this matchup, but we disagree. Two weeks ago, Pinnington Jones played in the Challenger final on grass. He enjoys playing on grass and will have a crowd on his side. We expect him to keep this match tight.

That being said, Pinnington Jones covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Jack Pinnington Jones +3.5 games handicap @1.91 @bet365

Dimitrov – Nishioka: 01.07.2025 17:00 CEST
H2H: 3-0

Yoshihito Nishioka has lost four of his last five matches. His last competitive match was in Halle, where he failed to qualify for the main draw of the tournament, losing to Hanfmann in the opening qualifying round.

According to the bookies, Dimitrov is the favourite in this matchup, and we agree. He is a way better grass-court player than Nishioka, and we expect him to dominate today.

That being said, Dimitrov covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Grigor Dimitrov -5.5 games handicap @1.80 @bet365

 Jannik Sinner wasted little energy in the London heat on Tuesday, when the top seed raced to a 6-4, 6-3, 6-0 first-round victory against Luca Nardi at Wimbledon. 

 In stark contrast to his great rival Carlos Alcaraz, who began his campaign with a gruelling five-set battle against Fabio Fognini on Monday, Sinner eased past his countryman Nardi in just one hour, 48 minutes. The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings converted five of 13 break points he earned and did not face any break points himself in a dominant display on No. 1 Court, where temperatures reached as high as 34 degrees Celsius. 

 “I'm very happy to come back here. It's such a special place for me,” said Sinner in his on-court interview. “Playing against an Italian is for us very unfortunate, but one has to go through, so I'm happy that it is me. The atmosphere as always is amazing, thanks so much. I know it's very hot, very humid. I don't remember the last time it was this weather in London.” 

Sinner soars ahead 🚀

 Tuesday's match was Sinner's first on the Grand Slam stage since he let slip three championship points against Alcaraz in last month's Roland Garros final. The Italian was keen to look forward when asked if his confident start at Wimbledon represented some form of reset. 

 “It's a new tournament. New chances, new challenges,” said Sinner. “You have one opponent at a time, so I'm very happy about today. Obviously, I try to keep going and try to enjoy playing here. If you don't enjoy playing on these courts, I don't know where you are going to enjoy it. I'm very happy to be here and let's see what comes.”

 Sinner dropped just 12 points on serve in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with the World No. 95 Nardi. Although he had to wait for success on return until the 10th game, when he broke Nardi's serve decisively to claim the first set, he barely looked back and dropped just three more games from then on. 

 “We worked a lot after Halle on the serve,” said Sinner. “Today, especially in the important moments, I was serving very well. In the beginning, I think we both struggled a little bit and there were not so many rallies, but after I tried to step up. I tried to hit through the ball. I'm very happy with how I ended the match, and hopefully that gives me the confidence to start the next match. 

 “First matches are never easy, so I'm very happy about my performance and especially my serving today.” 

 With his impressive response to his second-round loss to Alexander Bublik in Halle two weeks ago, Sinner set a meeting with Aleksandar Vukic, who defeated Tseng Chun-Hsin 6-3, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6(5), at Wimbledon. The 23-year-old, who has won three of the past six majors, has now won all 14 tour-level matches he has contested against fellow Italians.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Aryna Sabalenka explains why she did not apologise to Coco Gauff straight away after her Roland Garros comments","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/aryna-sabalenka-explains-why-she-did-not-apologise-to-coco-gauff-straight-away-after-her-roland-garros-comments/","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Aryna Sabalenka has been at the centre of a storm since losing the Roland Garros final to Coco Gauff.

Sabalenka made controversial comments at Roland Garros after losing in the final to Gauff.

There was a huge reaction to what the Belarusian said both on court and in her press conference, with Sabalenka being heavily criticised.  

This led to Sabalenka releasing a statement and subsequently apologising for what she had said.

After Sabalenka won her first match at Wimbledon against qualifier Carson Branstine in straight sets, she headed to speak on the Tennis Channel desk.

This is where the topic of her controversial Roland Garros comments were brought up once again, with Sabalenka explaining why she did not immediately apologise to Gauff.

“It's something I am definitely not proud of but we are all learning, right?” said Sabalenka. “I wanted to see her in person and talk to her but I just saw that she was still in New York while she is in Berlin so I was like maybe she is not coming.

“I had to text her but I wanted to talk in person. I had to message to apologise and say that I did not want to offend her. I lost control over my emotions and I was so upset with myself.

“I was just completely lost. I am really happy that she was like girl I got it, it's okay. No worries. It was such a relief over here.”

It appears that all is now well between the top two ranked WTA players, with Gauff accepting Sabalenka's apology.

Now in her first appearance at Wimbledon since 2023, Sabalenka will be looking to put all the controversy from Roland Garros behind her.

While Sabalenka has admitted that the backlash has taken its toll on her, she explained that she is now feeling recharged for the grass court major.

“It was really hard in that moment when I lost because for some reason I thought that I won the first set, I thought okay it's coming,” said Sabalenka. “But it slipped away.

“Then after a while I am glad it happened to me what happened because I had opportunities to sit back and look at everything as the bigger picture, and I realise that she was the better player so there is nothing to recover from that's it. 

“Move on to the next one. So I am here with a new set up in my head and recharged and ready to go.”

Sabalenka will now move on to her second round match, where she will play against Marie Bouzkova.

This will be a third time meeting between the pair, with Sabalenka leading the head-to-head 2-1.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

The American talked the widening gap between the Top 2 and the field after winning at SW19.ByDavid KanePublished Jul 01, 2025 copy_link

Published Jul 01, 2025

Tommy Paul has been known to enjoy a classic match from years past, but the American got to see one play out in real time when he spent a Sunday watching Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner for the Roland Garros title—all from the comfort of his phone.“I do love watching tennis while I'm in the tournament,” Paul told Steve Weissman and Jon Wertheim in his visit to the Tennis Channel Live Desk following a first-round Wimbledon win over Johannus Monday. “When I'm out of the tournament, I don't usually watch a lot. But I didn't miss that one. I was at my girlfriend's Polo event and watching on my phone. It was an unbelievable match.“I started watching it when I woke up and then five hours later I was still on my phone watching it.”

“I do love watching tennis while I'm in the tournament,” Paul told Steve Weissman and Jon Wertheim in his visit to the Tennis Channel Live Desk following a first-round Wimbledon win over Johannus Monday. “When I'm out of the tournament, I don't usually watch a lot.

It was an unbelievable match.“I started watching it when I woke up and then five hours later I was still on my phone watching it.”

“I started watching it when I woke up and then five hours later I was still on my phone watching it.”

Paul had played Alcaraz in the quarterfinals and, hindered by injury, managed just four games against the eventual champion. Asked about the state of the ATP field the American admitted that, even at his best, Alcaraz and Sinner are currently the toughest outs in tennis.“I think right now those guys are a level above everyone else,” said Paul, Wimbledon's No. 13 seed. “People have a lot of catching up to do. These guys are dominating when it comes to the Slams. These are the tournaments everyone wants to do the best in, and they're three out of five set matches. In best three out of five, I feel like the better player comes out on top most of the time, and they seem to be coming out on top every time. It shows that the people right below them really have to gain a level to be competing with them in these events.“Last year here against Carlos, I feel like I picked my level up in the opening set and at some point you feel like Carlos took it to another level and I couldn't stay there with him. He played so fast. It kind of feels like he's got constant pressure on you the entire time and you can't hit one ball that's without a ton of quality or he's on top of you, attacking the net. Same with Sinner. Sinner absolutely pounds the ball. If you don't play deep in the court and hit the ball hard, he's on offense and you definitely don't want to be on defense with those guys.”

Paul is a combined 3-9 against Alcaraz and Sinner, though one of his wins against the latter came on grass back in 2022. Making only his fourth main-draw appearance at the All England Club, the 28-year-old aims to better his quarterfinal finish from last season despite landing in the same section as Sinner.“For tennis, this is the mecca,” said Paul, who This is where you want to play, where you dream about playing when you're young.”Hoping to build towards a classic of his own, Paul will next play Austria's Sebastian Ofner in the second round.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","‘He Grabbed the Jar and That Was It'","https://www.profootballnetwork.com/tennis/jannik-sinner-coach-reveals-unexpected-thing-he-did-after-paris/","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 12:46:56 GMT","

Jannik Sinner was seemingly disappointed after his grueling French Open final loss to Carlos Alcaraz. However, his coach, Darren Cahill, recently shared that the Italian did something surprisingly amusing and moved on quickly from that heartbreak.

Sinner came extremely close to securing his third consecutive Grand Slam title at the 2025 French Open, but Alcaraz's resilience denied him. The defending champion fought back from two sets down and saved three championship points to defeat his arch-rival 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(10-2) in the longest French Open final in history.

Notably, Alcaraz became the first man to win a Major after saving match point since Novak Djokovic's triumph over Roger Federer in the 2019 Wimbledon final. Sinner, on the other hand, admitted the loss was painful and revealed he tried to erase the memories.

Sinner, however, moved on quickly after the close defeat, as revealed by coach Cahill in a humorous anecdote he shared during his appearance on ESPN.

“I must say, that half an hour afterwards, he went and did the press. We were walking to transport, we had this big bus where we all sit in. And for the players, they have these candy jar that you can take a couple of candies as you walk out of the Roland Garros,” he said.

The 59-year-old added that Sinner, after two weeks on a strict diet, broke his restraint with the candy jar and cheerfully handed treats to everyone.

“He took the whole jar (chuckled). So he grabbed the glass jar, had the candies, he had been on a strict diet for two weeks, and that was it. The diet was out the window. In the car, he was handing candies out to everyone. He was laughing, he was giggling. He moved on pretty quickly. And it'll be interesting to see how he moves on here, because this will be the big test,” he added.

Sinner enjoyed a strong clay-court run despite returning from a three-month doping suspension. Before Roland Garros, he reached the Italian Open final but was defeated by Alcaraz.

Nonetheless, the World No. 1 will now shift his focus to the Wimbledon Championships.

Sinner will begin his Wimbledon campaign against compatriot Luca Nardi on Tuesday, July 1. He heads into Wimbledon after a surprising second-round defeat at the Terra Wortmann Open to eventual champion Alexander Bublik.

The match against Nardi presents a new challenge for the three-time Major champion, as it will be their first meeting on tour. However, Sinner holds the edge with a strong 19–3 win-loss record in 2025, a solid 66.67% win rate on grass, and the advantage of being the tournament's top seed.

The Italian enjoyed a deep run at Wimbledon last year, reaching the quarterfinals before falling to then-fifth seed Daniil Medvedev. He'll be aiming to go even further this year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","'Don't call it Wimbledon': The unspoken spectator rules and dress codes of the tennis tournament","https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250627-the-unspoken-rules-and-dress-codes-for-attending-wimbledon-tennis","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 09:39:30 GMT","

The Championships have begun, and the quintessentially British tennis tournament has some very particular codes for attendees to follow. How are spectators expected to behave, and what should they – or should they definitely not – wear?

Afternoon tea, a stiff upper lip and Wimbledon – all so deeply ""British"" that they've become part of the nation's international brand; the things that seem to make Britain, Britain, and tempt tourists from far and wide to observe them for themselves. 

The optics of the annual tennis tournament in south London – the strawberries and cream, the Pimm's, the ball girls and boys – are all intrinsic to this frightfully British institution. It is a marker of ""The Season"", alongside the likes of the Chelsea Flower Show, Henley and Ascot, as well, of course, as being a place where balls are expertly hit by rackets. Equally intrinsic to the Britishness of the tournament are its less tangible cornerstones. Its rules and the etiquette are paramount, both in terms of behaviour and dress – in other words, what to wear, and what falls a little long of the baseline. 

So what does the etiquette of Wimbledon entail? For starters, according to the self-styled queen of etiquette, Laura Windsor – who advised on the TV series Bridgerton –  don't call it Wimbledon. ""Really, when one refers to Wimbledon, one should say the Championships, as they are the oldest and most prestigious lawn tennis championships in the world."" Another suitable moniker is simply ""the tennis"".

Attendees should, she tells the BBC, be behaving ""with modesty… That's our Britishness, isn't it? We're prim and proper"". What does this look like? For a start, avoiding many of the kinds of behaviours that are the norm at other sporting events, and instead behaving in ways arguably more in line with theatre-going, keeping things largely hushed, and not cracking out a selfie-stick – they were banned from the tournament in 2015. Although for British etiquette coach and author of Just Good Manners, William Hanson, ""anyone who is still using a selfie-stick in 2025 should be monitored closely, anyway"".

According to Hanson, ""while people love the social side of Wimbledon, it is worth remembering that it is a seated, sporting event that comes with its own set of court-side rules."" He goes on: ""Be punctual, and get in your seat in good time… respect the fact that you can only come and go during a changeover."" Of course, phones should be on silent. But he also extends his guidance to how best to rally around the players, and officials, on court: “Be sporting with your support, and never cheer errors or mistakes. Respect the silence during play, and save clapping and cheering for between points. Avoid disturbing the players by calling out, and remember the umpire's decision is final – never heckle or question line calls.""

Beyond that, ""keep your yourself to yourself,"" he says. ""Be aware of those sitting around you, and keep within the space of your seat – even if it is limited, try not to spill over into someone else's personal space accidentally."" And, in case you were thinking about sneaking in a tuna melt, ""avoid disturbing the peace by rustling wrappers or eating messy or smelly food"".

Most obviously, though, the rules are embodied in what to wear – ""the best way to show good behaviour is by dressing appropriately,"" says Windsor. While Wimbledon has no strict dress code, smart dress is encouraged, especially on the show courts. Plus certain items, such as ripped jeans, dirty trainers and anything with a political statement, are banned. ""Be comfortable and appropriate for the weather,"" says Hanson, ""but avoid anything that is overly casual or better worn at the beach"".

Unofficially, however, Wimbledon has developed its own set of style rules. Take for proof of these unspoken but still-tangible ""rules"" the criticism that Meghan, Duchess of Sussex faced from some corners for wearing jeans, alongside a hat and blazer, to watch her friend Serena Williams play in 2019.

For Daniel-Yaw Miller, sports and fashion journalist and founder of the SportsVerse newsletter, ""when you think about Wimbledon dressing, everyone has the same kind of thing in mind – either white or beige. You wear a blazer, you can wear a hat."" Guests often favour floral frocks, polka dots and tailoring. By osmosis, a dress code seems to have been landed upon. For Windsor, dressing appropriately means ""something that is demure and sophisticated,"" such as crisp linen and tailored pieces.

While Hanson points out that ""wide-brimmed hats are best avoided as they can get in the way of those sitting behind you,"" Panama hats have become something of an official Wimbledon uniform, popular in the audience from the start of the 20th Century.

Over the years, a number of high-profile celebrities have offered up glowing examples of how to ace it sartorially in the stands of Centre Court. Zendaya, patron saint of ""tenniscore"", schooled Wimbledon-goers last year when she wore Ralph Lauren menswear-inspired looks – crisp white and old school tweed suit jackets, blue-and-white-striped shirts and ties. 

More like this:

• The world's first global sporting celebrity

• How 'dollar princesses' brought US flair

• Why Wimbledon players dress code is so strict

Other smashes include Meghan in neat pleats and white shirts, Keira Knightley in a dropped-waist Chanel dress, Tom Cruise, year-on-year, in natty suit after natty suit, Alexa Chung in Aran-knit cardigans and crisp cotton poplin skirts, and Pierce Brosnan in navy linen suits with neat pocket squares. Arguably, however, queen of SW19 dressing is Sienna Miller, thanks to her broderie anglaise dresses and easy-breezy linen suits, bright white Galvan jumpsuits and polka dots. Others have aced it despite not sticking to the script – see Grace Jones in a flight suit for a perfect example, or Idris Elba in a striking Super Eagles shirt.

Catherine, Princess of Wales, who is the royal patron of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, often wears green or purple, the official colours of the tournament since 1909. In recent years she's attended in a plethora of shades of green, such as a forest green Dolce & Gabbana crepe midi-dress in 2019, and in 2021 an emerald green Emilia Wickstead number – the colour of the grass at the beginning of the tournament, if not the end. Last year, Kate wore a purple Safiyaa dress to present the trophies for the men's singles.

The presence of royalty every year underlines the event's sense of tradition, and tennis has long been associated with wealth, status and glamour. ""Tennis was this social game, rather elite and glamorous,"" says Elizabeth Wilson, author of Love Game: A History of Tennis, from Victorian Pastime to Global Phenomenon –  its original setting was the country house. ""It is, without doubt, a traditionally upper-class sport, and that essence still permeates through a lot of tennis,"" says Miller. He likens it to cricket, or Ascot, ""where you have to be so respectful, as an outsider coming in, of the rules"".

Even among tennis tournaments, Wimbledon is extra-proper. ""You look at other grand slams, [it] is the polar opposite,"" Miller says, mentioning some examples: walk-out music, players dancing as they come out, Kiss Cam, hot dogs for sale and T-shirt guns. 

It is, says Miller, ""one of the last bastions of old-school British culture in the mainstream"". Its archaic quality is, for some, part of its charm and appeal. ""I see Wimbledon as essentially like a museum. You go there for a fascinating day out, for an insight into what the past of British society looked like,"" he says.

All this also has its downsides. ""From a fan perspective, you're really made to feel like you're stepping into a space that is not yours,"" says Miller. You need, to a certain extent, ""to act like you've been there before"".

Over the years, however, Wimbledon's codes have been shifting. In lots of ways Wilson thinks ""it's more participatory [now]"". In the past, ""people have described how the atmosphere was more like a cathedral, there was a rather holy atmosphere – whereas that's very far from how it is today.""

Hanson agrees. ""If we think of the Henman Hill/Murray Mound (and the rest), levels of patriotism and emotion, it is unlike public displays we would have seen in the past.""

Crowds do now whoop and shout, at least between points, and even partake in the occasional Mexican wave, which, according to Wilson, ""nobody would have thought of doing in the 1950s"". When Miller went last year, he ""could definitely feel that it was a bit more of a modern tennis experience"". He can feel it, he says, ""loosening up, just the tiniest bit"".

Dress-wise, also, attitudes are softening. Miller sees Idris Elba and David Beckham as shining examples of dressers who know how to be Wimbledon-appropriate without looking stuck in the past. ""The look is more 'fancy barbecue' than 'super formal event'"".

For Hanson, points of etiquette prevail. ""Etiquette is all about how our actions and behaviours affect or impact other people. We need to be considerate and careful in how we behave to ensure that everyone has a great day watching tennis. Wimbledon thrives on its age-old rituals, and remains one of the key traditional British summer sporting events – hopefully, for this special fortnight, we can all remember our manners, on court and off.""

Elisabetta Cocciaretto stuns No. 3 seed Jessica Pegula in under an hour at Wimbledon. (0:29)

WIMBLEDON, England -- American No. 3 seed Jessica Pegula suffered her earliest defeat at a major since 2020 as she was beaten 6-2, 6-3 by Italian Elisabetta Cocciaretto, the world No. 116, in the first round at Wimbledon on Tuesday.

Pegula, 31, came into Wimbledon on the back of her ninth career title in Bad Homburg, Germany, where she beat former world No.1 Iga Swiatek in the final -- on grass.

""She played absolutely incredible tennis. Pegula said of the 24-year-old Cocciaretto, who became the first Italian -- male or female -- to beat a top-3 seed at Wimbledon since the Open Era began in 1968. ""Do I think I played the best match ever? No. But I definitely don't think I was playing bad. It wasn't like I was playing that bad.

""She just was hitting her shots and going for it, serving big, serving high percentage, going big second serves, redirecting the ball. It was just her day, I honestly think.""

The match took less than an hour. Pegula is the highest seed to fall in either the women's or men's singles.

Cocciaretto became the first Italian to defeat a WTA top-3 ranked player at a major since the 2015 US Open semifinals, when Roberta Vinci and Flavia Pennetta both beat did it, beating No. 1 Serena Williams and No. 2 Simona Halep, respectively.

""[I told myself to] be more aggressive and go for it,"" said Cocciaretto, whose ranking has dipped in recent months. ""Don't think about losing or winning the point.""

Jessica Pegula only won five games against Elisabetta Cocciaretto, the second-fewest by any women's top-3 seed in her opening match at Wimbledon since the Open Era began in 1968.

Pegula had beaten Cocciaretto in their only previous meeting, at Wimbledon in 2023, but hit just five winners and made 24 unforced errors as she slumped to defeat. She also struggled on second serve, winning just 42% of points.

""It wasn't (good); it was terrible,"" Pegula said of her serve. ""... It's so frustrating when something you've been working on so much doesn't come and help you when you want it to, especially on grass.""

It's the first time Pegula has lost in the first round of any Grand Slam event since the 2020 French Open.

""It's really a bummer to lose,"" Pegula said. ""... I'm upset that I wasn't able to turn anything around. But at the same time, I do feel like she played kind of insane. Kudos to her.""

Pegula wore tape on her left knee, which she injured last year and missed a match at the WTA Finals in November and missed the Brisbane International in January as a result. Pegula, however, said the knee wasn't an issue on Tuesday.

""The knee feels good,"" said Pegula, who had won 17 consecutive first-round matches in a major since 2021. ""There wasn't really anything bothering me. I'm managing it pretty well. I think it's not really holding me back. ... So I feel good. That's why it's kind of disappointing that I'm not able to keep it going here.""

Cocciaretto will play American Katie Volynets in the second round.

But at the same time, I do feel like she played kind of insane. Hats off to her. Kudos to her for playing at a high level that I couldn't match it today.""

Pegula's bad luck in the first round, which saw six of her first seven appearances at majors result in a first-round loss, came to an end in 2020, when she last lost to top-ranked women's pro Aryna Sabalenka at the French Open.

The No. 3 seed became the highest-ranked upset thus far, losing to Elisabetta Cocciaretto.ByDavid KanePublished Jul 01, 2025 copy_link

Published Jul 01, 2025

Day 2 of Wimbledon kicked off with the biggest upset of the 2025 Championships thus far as No. 3 seed Jessica Pegula fell in the first round in under an hour to Elisabetta Cocciaretto, 6-2, 6-3.Pegula arrived to the All England Club days after winning her second career grass-court title at the Bad Homburg Open, but couldn't convert the momentum into a Wimbledon run against the No. 116th-ranked Coacciaretto, who advanced on No. 2 Court in 58 minutes flat.The 31-year-old American enjoyed a Grand Slam breakthrough in 2024 when she reached her first Grand Slam final at the US Open, but she has not made it past the fourth round in her three subsequent major main-draw appearances despite solid results on all surfaces this season. Though her Roland Garros campaign ended abruptly in the fourth round when she fell in three sets to French wild card Loïs Boisson, who went on to reach the semifinals, Pegula looked back in form on grass when she won the title in Bad Homburg.

In the final pre-Wimbledon warm-up event, Pegula scored a straight-sets victory over former world No. 1 Iga Swiatek to win her ninth WTA title, but was out of sorts from the outset against Cocciaretto, a former world No. 29. The 24-year-old made it to the third round of Wimbledon back in 2023—where, ironically, she lost to Pegula—and reached the semifinals of the Libéma Open in ‘s-Hertogenbosch last month, but with a 1-7 record vs. the Top 10, wasn't expected to trouble the in-form Pegula on Tuesday.Still, it was Cocciaretto with the strong start as play opened on No. 2 Court, the Italian breaking Pegula twice to capture the opening set.Pegula kept things closer in the second set but netted a backhand down break point to hand Cocciaretto a 4-3 lead, one the unseeded underdog converted into her first career Top 5 victory. Cocciaretto became the first Italian woman to defeat a Top 3 seed at Wimbledon in the Open Era, and the first Italian woman to defeat a Top 3 seed at any major tournament since 2015 when Flavia Pennetta and Roberta Vinci upset Simona Halep and Serena Williams, respectively, to reach that year's final.Pegula's exit opens up the bottom half of the draw for fellow seeds Swiatek, 2022 champion Elena Rybakina, and two-time Grand Slam finalist Karolina Muchova, all of whom shared a quarter with the American. They will all be in action later on Tuesday.

The Athletic has live coverage from Day 2 at Wimbledon 2025.

Some 20 hours after Taylor Fritz and Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard started a match that put Wimbledon's curfew under a microscope, their battle ended like it always seemed it would: in a tight fifth set, with the man who executed his big-time serve in the crucial moments just a little better coming out on top.

Serving to stay in the match, Mpetshi Perricard missed four first serves, one second serve and two forehands as Fritz pulled off the strangest of comebacks from two sets down to win 6-7(6), 6-7(8), 6-4, 7-6(6), 6-4, after being two points from elimination the previous evening

“I thought it would be all over last night,” said Fritz, the No. 5 seed.

This last set was always going to a nervy one. The first four had ended just after 10:15 p.m. Monday night, after nearly three hours of roller coaster, tiebreak tennis between two of the biggest servers in the sport.

Fritz had won more points and made fewer errors, but found himself down two sets to love after losing two tiebreaks to the Frenchman, who is one of the only players in the sport with a serve bigger than the American's. He hit the fastest in tournament history that first night, at 153 miles per hour, but Fritz blocked it back and won the point.

But the American, who prides his competitiveness above his tennis skill, rode out the storm to win the next two sets, including a fourth-set tiebreak in which he rallied from a 5-1 deficit, two points from defeat. After doing so, he pumped his chest to his box, let out a cry of “let's f—ing go” and sat down ready to ride the wave of momentum to the finish line … or so he thought.

After a protracted discussion with a tournament official, the match was suspended due to the Wimbledon curfew, which is at 11 p.m. local time, even though it was only 10:18 p.m. when play was stopped. “Then don't ask me,” Fritz said as he sat down in his chair and packed up his rackets, before saying to his box that he “couldn't do anything.”

Fritz had all the momentum. Mpetshi Perricard had the environmental advantage, playing under a roof on a fast court, able to fire at will without any sun or wind to worry about.

Fritz wanted to play. Mpetshi Perricard wanted sleep – or maybe just a little more than a couple minutes to cool off from blowing the tiebreak and maybe the match. With the two players at a standstill, the call fell to the supervisor. He told the players they were done for the night. Fritz flailed his arms and made his case, to no avail.

After it was over, Mpetshi Perricard said in his news conference that the decision was simple for him. He did not want to stop at 4-4 or 5-5 in a fifth set and come back the next day.

Fritz said he understood that, but three-quarters of a day later, he was still a little baffled about how everything went down Monday night.

First, he didn't understand why they were having the conversation in the first place. Second, after he lost the argument, he didn't understand why the supervisor kept asking him how he felt about the decision

“He just wanted me to agree with him,” Fritz said after his win. “I said, ‘I don't know why you keep asking me because I want to play. Stop asking me because you already said we're not playing.'”

Fritz said he knew Mpetshi Perricard was better off playing indoors. He didn't care. He was confident that he was in the ascendancy and had no intention of letting up. He said he went to sleep knowing that his opponent was probably going to be thinking hard about that last tiebreak.

“I think it would have been easy for me to get frustrated about not being able to play last night,” he said. “To be honest, I felt confident going into the fifth set if it was last night or today.”

After the supervisor had made his decision, Mpetshi Perricard had grabbed his bag and walked off, like a man given a reprieve. Fritz had taken to social media to tell the world he was ready to go, but his opponent had pulled the rip cord.

And so, a little more than 17 hours later, they walked back onto the court. As Fritz got ready to serve, the crowd got loud as it never does at the start of the match.

The All England Club confirmed the curfew as the reason for why the match was suspended 42 minutes before 11 p.m. Fritz and Mpetshi Perricard's four previous sets lasted 44 minutes, 48 minutes, 33 minutes and 45 minutes, and only one of those sets would have fit within the time remaining.

The curfew rule was introduced by Merton Council in 2009, when a roof was installed on Centre Court. It is designed to “balance the consideration of local residents with the scale of an international tennis event that takes place in a residential area,” according to a previous statement from the All England Club. Its usage is designed to encourage fairness to both players in that context.

Unlike the other three Grand Slams, which run night sessions which can go into the early hours of the morning, Wimbledon stops play an hour before midnight without fail.

When Fritz and Mpetshi Perricard returned, their plot from the previous night stayed on track through the first nine games of the decider. Mpetshi Perricard had the best chance at a break midway through the set. Fritz served a double fault at 40-0, and then two points later, after another first-serve miss, Mpetshi-Perricard had the first of two chances to get to a break point, which would have been his first of the match.

A chip-and-charge play went awry. Fritz got his own serve back on track and survived.

Then they got to 4-3. Life often gets tight in tennis in the eighth game. Mpetshi Perricard was four poor points from giving Fritz a chance to serve out the match. He didn't flinch, banging some of his biggest balls of the last set, though with air heavy and the balls picking up moisture from sweat and the grass, he didn't get close to his record-setting serve of Monday night.

Fritz passed his own serve test at 4-4 with relative ease. And then it fell to Mpetshi Perricard to prove his nerve. He double-faulted on the first point, and the faults and errors never stopped until the last one went long. The world No. 5 and the top American man was moving on, about 20 hours after he thought he would.

Avid tennis players and casual fans agree that the US Open is electric. A lot goes into putting on the tennis event of the year, so we caught up with two in-the-know Greenwich residents. Eric Butorac, Senior Director of USTA Player Relations and Business Development, and Elizabeth Schrohe, Player Relations and Business Development, were excited to share their thoughts.

Kids in Tow
Think Fan Week. You get the full feel of the US Open experience, and it's totally free. If you're considering bringing kids, this is the best time to go. The vibe is relaxed, and you can take plenty of close-up player pictures and get autographs.

New this year is the exciting Mixed Doubles Championships on Tuesday, August 19, and Wednesday the 20th. This will be a reimagined and elevated mixed doubles format, featuring a million-dollar prize. Early-round matches on Tuesday in Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong stadiums will be top-notch and a less- expensive way to enjoy a day at the Open.

The Tennis Junkie
Buy tickets to any of the early-round day sessions. Look for upper-level seats in Ashe or Armstrong stadiums (insurance in case it rains). Plan to be at the gates when they open at 10 a.m. The first hour after gates open is the ideal window to catch the players practicing. The best deal of the US Open is the daily grounds passes (limited availability). With a grounds pass, you can access the general admission section in Louis Armstrong, spend the day watching matches on the outdoor courts and watch Arthur Ashe matches on the giant screens outside the stadium.

Date Night—or Day
Wrap up summer with a date night—or day—over Labor Day weekend. Savor some of the hottest NYC restaurant spots at the stands and cafés. Sample Coqadoc's chicken nuggets with caviar, and wash it down with the Open's signature drink, the Honey Deuce. Cap off your special outing with something from the onsite Ralph Lauren shop that features commemorative US Open apparel. For an added touch, RL offers customization.



Plan Ahead for Travel
• Build in extra time for traffic and parking.
• Avoid arriving right at match start times
(11 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.).

Avoid Peak Entry Times
Give yourself time to park, go through security, shop, snack and get to your seat.

Check Out The Mets Schedule
• Traffic and parking are much worse on Mets home-game days.
• There is no US Open parking in the Mets lot when there's a game.

Prep for Weather
•Bring a hat, sunscreen and a paper fan.
•Stay cool at the air-conditioned Amex Fan Experience.

Explore the Shops
• Save time to browse for official gear and souvenirs.

Download the US Open App
• Get maps, live match updates and event info at your fingertips.
• usopen.org

Expert Tip
Before you go, print out the day's Order of Play to plan your day, allowing room to adjust. You never know when you might catch one of those epic five-set matches.

The Wow Factor
Consider booking a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The US Open features a number of custom opportunities to make memories that will last forever.

Consider the Play Like a Pro experience. Spend the day just like a professional player during Finals Weekend. Get picked up by the Player Car Service and have breakfast in the Player Dining Area. Next, spend two hours hitting balls with the likes of Andre Agassi, Andy Roddick, Lindsay Davenport or other legends. Finally, enjoy a Player Only Shopping Experience before you shower and arrive in your suite to watch the match of the day. 

Another new offering is Hit on Ashe. Yes, you can hit on the storied court! Your Player Service Car will drop you off at the Player Entrance, and you'll be ushered in for a tour and walk the Player Hallway—that seminal place where we watch our favorite players being interviewed as they walk out to the court.

You will then enter tennis's biggest stage—Arthur Ashe Stadium. For an hour, you'll hit with a pro, soak in the atmosphere and, of course, leave with amazing photos—all followed by a shower and lunch in a premium hospitality space before watching tennis's top stars from a courtside seat.

A Special Celebration

For that big birthday blowout or anniversary celebration, plan a grand slam victory by booking a luxury suite. You and 20 of your friends will enjoy special parking passes, prime views and a chef-curated menu. Take the celebration to the next level by including a VIP appearance, featuring top athletes, legendary stars and renowned coaches.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","DJ Bennett's college success sets her up for more shots at the U.S. Open","https://www.ocala.com/story/sports/tennis/2025/06/30/dj-bennett-is-steps-closer-to-realizing-a-decade-old-goal/84331548007/","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 14:11:16 GMT","

Most mornings you can find DJ Bennett, Belleview's first tennis champion in school history, in Auburn's tennis training facility recovering from an oblique strain. Through rounds of dead bugs and planks, Bennett prepares for her next chance to qualify for the U.S. Open before her 22nd birthday.

Just 10 years ago Bennett was forming the dream of playing professional tennis. In November, Bennett, Auburn's first NCAA women's singles finalist earned a slot in the first American Collegiate Wildcard Playoff. The first of four events Bennett will use to qualify for the U.S. Open in August.

""Every young tennis player dream about it, but not many people get to say that they're actually doing it,"" Bennett said. ""So yeah, 11-year-old, they would definitely be freaking out and would be proud.""

July marks a busy run of tournaments for Bennett. Her first tournament of the month is the McLeod for Health Florence Open in Florence, South Carolina during July 21-27. Then Bennett heads to Lexington, Kentucky for The Lexington Open that begins a day later on July 28. Weeks before the start of Auburn's 2025-26 season begins, the Tiger standout will compete in the Women's 35K ITF tournament in Southaven, Mississippi starting Aug. 4.

Those three opportunities are all less than a month away from the start of the 2025 U.S. Open. The draws for each tournament haven't released yet but there's an opportunity for Bennett to win prize money and her first taste of the biggest stage in American professional tennis.

 ""It was a long build up,” Bennett said. “I knew that I was in the event for November, since I made it to the finals of NCAA. I had a lot longer like mentally to prepare, knowing that I was going to be playing that event for like seven months.""

Now that eight months have passed Bennett is a strong tournament run from her first opportunity to make the U.S. Open main draw, but the hunt is far from over. Bennett is still a rising star in her sport. As a junior in college, she's in the perfect position to grow towards her childhood dreams.

Whether the 11-year-old girl who watches in wonder behind Bennett's mature exterior realizes or not the professional ranks are calling her name. With the trajectory she's on the phone won't stop ringing any time soon.

""It's nice that they have that option as well but that doesn't necessarily mean that it could go to like a college player,"" Bennett said. ""It could go to another American playing those tournaments, but it's still like a good opportunity and a good chance to have another shot at making it to New York in August.""","{'href': 'https://www.ocala.com', 'title': 'Ocala StarBanner'}","tennis"

                Basilashvili def. Musetti 6-2 4-6 7-5 6-1.            

33-year-old Nikoloz Basilashvili possibly caused the upset of the men's Wimbledon Championships 2025 so far, as he took out No. 7 seed Lorenzo Musetti in dramatic fashion on Tuesday. The Georgian produced a relentless attack and left his Italian opponent with no answers in the Round of 128 clash. Basilashvili struck 15 aces and 48 winners en route to a four set victory.

Ranked No. 126 in the world, Basilashvili started the match on a high note. He pushed Musetti from side to side, and the 2024 Wimbledon semifinalist had no answers to the shot making. As a result, he became the third Top-10 player in the men's draw to drop out of the competition in the opening round – after Holger Rune and Daniil Medvedev.

Normally adept at baseline exchanges and using the slice to his advantage, Musetti found himself on the attacking end for merely 17% of the match. He hit 21 winners and 29 unforced errors. On the other hand, Basilashvili brushed aside second set jitters to inch closer to the baseline and prevent Musetti from dictating rallies. “I was struggling to feel comfortable on the court from the beginning,” said the 23-year-old who led the ATP Tour for grass court wins in 2024.

Born in Tbilisi, Georgia in 1992, Nikoloz Basilashvili is a two-time entrant into the Wimbledon third round (2015, 2022). The 33-year-old turned pro in 2008, and has been ranked as high as No. 16 in the world. Having started playing tennis at the age of 5, Basilashvili currently has just as many singles trophies to his name. He played his biggest final at the 2021 Indian Wells Masters, where he lost to Cameron Norrie.

Nikoloz Basilashvili made his Grand Slam debut at the 2015 Roland Garros – he lost in the opening fixture to Thanasi Kokkinakis. The former Top-20 starlet has noteworthy wins against some of the world's best players. He has beaten the likes of Roger Federer (2021), Alexander Zverev (2019), Dominic Thiem (2017) as well as Stefanos Tsitsipas (2021), among others.

After dropping the first two sets, Taylor Fritz rallies to win the fifth set 6-4 against France's Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard and advance to the second round at Wimbledon. (0:43)

WIMBLEDON, England -- After dealing with his opponent's 153 mph serve -- the fastest in Wimbledon history -- and an overnight postponement, American Taylor Fritz returned Tuesday to win the fifth set and finish off a 6-7 (6), 6-7 (8), 6-4, 7-6 (6), 6-4 first-round win over Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.

Not only did Fritz, the 2024 US Open runner-up, need to turn things around after dropping the opening two sets, but he was two points from defeat on a half-dozen occasions in the fourth-set tiebreaker Monday night.

""A really crazy match,"" the No. 5-seeded Fritz said Tuesday after wrapping up the victory at No. 1 Court. ""I thought it was about to be all over last night in the fourth-set tiebreaker. But he came back on me in the first two tiebreakers, so I thought maybe I had one in me. I'm super happy to get through it.""

After Fritz forced the fifth set Monday at about 10:15 p.m., the match was suspended because there is a curfew at the All England Club that halts play at 11 p.m., and officials were concerned about finishing by that time.

It was clear Fritz preferred to continue, but it wasn't up to him.

""I mean, it's obviously not ideal,"" the 27-year-old Californian said Tuesday. ""I felt like if we weren't going to have time to finish the fifth set, then absolutely I think it makes sense not to play the fifth set. But we were having sets about as long as you can possibly play sets, and they were still in the time frame that we had last night to play the fifth.

""I obviously wanted to play it, but either way, I felt confident coming back today (and) getting it done, as well.""

As it turned out, he needed only 35 minutes Tuesday to get the job done in a contest that featured 66 total aces -- 37 by Mpetshi Perricard, 29 by Fritz.

On the third point of the match Monday, Mpetshi Perricard -- a 6-foot-8 Frenchman who is 21 -- smacked a serve at 153 mph, eclipsing the old tournament best of 148 mph by Taylor Dent in 2010.

Fritz lost in the first round at the French Open last month, but he is far more comfortable on slick, speedy grass courts, which reward the power on his big serve and forehand. He reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon in 2022 and last year, and he is coming off his fourth Eastbourne Open title on the surface last week.

""This is a huge, huge week for me, with the recent results on grass. So I was thinking about that in this match,"" he said. ""It put a lot of pressure on me, because I really didn't want to go out in the first round.""

In other matches Tuesday, top-ranked Jannik Sinner got his Wimbledon campaign off to an ideal start by beating Luca Nardi 6-4, 6-3, 6-0 in an all-Italian matchup.

The three-time Grand Slam champion, who lost a five-set French Open final to Carlos Alcaraz, is in search of his first Wimbledon title. He was a semifinalist at the All England Club in 2023.

""First matches are never easy, so I'm very happy about my performance,"" he said in his on-court interview. ""It's a new tournament, new chances, new challenges. You have one opponent at a time.""

Sinner will play Aleksandar Vukic of Australia in the second round.

After her Wimbledon win on Monday, Naomi Osaka touched upon her link-up with Nick Kyrgios for the mixed-doubles event at the New York Major

Naomi Osaka put up an impressive show on Monday to advance to the second round of the 2025 Wimbledon Championships.

During the match, she received support from a special spectator in Nick Kyrgios, with whom she's due to partner up for the renewed mixed-doubles competition of the 2025 US Open. The two are a pair among the star-studded field of 16 teams.

Osaka is looking forward to the event and has a special message for Kyrgios. She touched upon the same during her post-match presser on Monday, but kept the message to herself.

“I have something so crazy to say, but I'm not going to say it,” she told the media at SW19. “I'm not going to. I'll see him in person and say it.”

Kyrgios carries a strong sense of individuality that has contrasting effects on bystanders, but Osaka seems to understand the position the Aussie has been in.

“I am really excited to play mixed doubles with him,” she added. “I think he's obviously won a doubles tournament. Yeah, I think it should be fun. I don't know, I have always felt like I've always related to him in a weird way, even though we're completely different. I kind of understand some of the things that he does.

“So yeah, I am glad that he came to my match. I hope in some way maybe he felt I wouldn't be bold enough to say ‘inspired', but I hope he could relate a little bit to the things that I do, too.”

Fritz defeated Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in the fifth set Tuesday.

American tennis star Taylor Fritz is off to a strong start at The Championships, securing his first win on the iconic grass court after returning the fastest serve ever recorded at Wimbledon.

The U.S. Open runner-up returned a top-speed serve at 153 mph off unranked Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in the opening game of their match Monday.

The World No. 5 men's singles player not only returned the new record-setting serve, but controlled the rally to win the point.

Perricard's record breaks the previous mark that American Taylor Dent set with his 148-mph serve in 2010, ESPN first reported.

The pair's match was postponed at 10:20 p.m. local time until Tuesday, shortly after Fritz battled back from two sets down to force a decisive fifth set following his tiebreak win in the fourth.

The crowd audibly criticized the umpire's ruling, booing the decision and announcement that they would suspend play for the late time, which was nearing Wimbledon's 11 p.m. curfew.

On Tuesday, Fritz and Perricard resumed on Court No. 1.

The 27-year-old San Diego native controlled the final set 6 games to 4 for his first win of the tournament.

Elisabetta Cocciaretto's 58-minute win over Pegula is the fastest win against a Top 5 seed at a major since 2022 -- and only the second Top 10 win of her career.

WIMBLEDON -- Twelve months ago, Elisabetta Cocciaretto's strong grass-court form came to a halt when a bout of pneumonia forced her to withdraw from Wimbledon.

The Italian made up for that in the first round on Tuesday by delivering the biggest upset of the 2025 tournament so far, ousting No. 3 seed Jessica Pegula 6-2, 6-3 in just 58 minutes. The result was the quickest defeat of a Top 5 seed at a major since Jule Niemeier's 58-minute 6-4, 6-0 defeat of Anett Kontaveit in the second round of Wimbledon 2022.

Wimbledon: Scores | Order of play | Draw

The result is Cocciaretto's second career Top 10 victory -- both of which have come in the first round of a major, following her defeat of Petra Kvitova at that stage of Roland Garros 2023. The 24-year-old is a two-time grass-court semifinalist, having made the last four at Birmingham 2024 and again in 's-Hertogenbosch three weeks ago.

Pegula also came into the tournament in form. Last week in Bad Homburg, she picked up her second grass-court title. But Cocciaretto took the ball relentlessly early to redirect all of the American's pace, tallying 17 winners to Pegula's five. She also served flawlessly, conceding just eight points in total behind her delivery and did not face a break point during the match -- while capturing Pegula's serve three times.

Cocciaretto advanced to the third round of Wimbledon for the second time. She avenged her 6-4, 6-0 loss to Pegula at the same stage in 2023. Pegula fell in the first round of a Grand Slam for the first time since Roland Garros 2020, where she lost her opener to Aryna Sabalenka 6-3, 6-1.

""I was so pumped to play Wimbledon this year,"" Cocciaretto said in her on-court interview. ""I couldn't wait until the match started, I was practicing so hard.""

The reason she was extra-pumped? Not just her love of Wimbledon or affinity for grass, but in order to banish the memories of 2024. This time last year, she was ranked No. 43 but is now down at No. 116 -- a slide that started when what she thought was a mild illness turned out to be much more serious.

""I was playing Birmingham,"" she said. ""The day of quarterfinals, when I won against [Diana] Shnaider, I was really sick in the night, like sweating a lot and feeling really bad. I had a lot of fever.""

Cocciaretto wasn't about to let a semifinal opportunity pass her by, though -- and how bad could it be, she thought? Even after she had to retire mid-match against Yulia Putintseva, she still thought she could continue her strong play in Bad Homburg the following week.

""I was supposed to play against [Maria] Sakkari first round,"" Cocciaretto said. ""I withdraw because I couldn't walk. I couldn't wake up from the bed. I stayed five or six days with 39, 40 degrees of fever. I took antibiotics and everything. But the thing is that I was sleeping, like, 15 hours a day.

""I had mycoplasma virus pneumoniae. I went to the hospital, and I was sick until the Olympic Games.""

Cocciaretto considers grass her favorite surface -- which is why she was so devastated in 2024, and so keen to make up for it this year. That wasn't always the case: as a child, she initially played like a typical clay-courter.

""My game was completely different,"" she said. ""I stayed away from the court, running a lot. Then with Fausto [Scolari], my coach, he changed me completely. I stay really near the court. I go really aggressive. I think I adapt really well. I think I'm pretty good working around the court. Like, for me it's comfortable. I don't know why, because I really played maybe four or five tournaments in my life on grass.""

Without an abundance of grass courts, the Italian tennis federation built what Cocciaretto calls ""a garden with tennis court lines"" for their juniors to train on ahead of the grass swing. This confirmed the newly aggressive Cocciaretto's affinity for the surface.

""From there, I said to Fausto, 'I want to play in the future Wimbledon, because I think I can play really well,'"" she said. ""I said to myself, 'I can.' So always when I step on grass courts, I'm really happy just to play there.""

Cocciaretto's brilliance was acknowledged by the opposition. Pegula's coach congratulated her afterward, and the US Open finalist was quick to praise her to reporters.

""She played absolutely incredible tennis,"" Pegula said. ""Do I think I played the best match ever? No, but I definitely don't think I was playing bad. It wasn't like I was playing that bad. She just was hitting her shots and going for it, serving big, serving high percentage, going big second serves, redirecting the ball.

""I do feel like she played kind of insane. Hats off to her. Kudos to her for playing at a high level that I couldn't match it today.""

Cocciaretto will bid to return to the third round against Katie Volynets, who defeated another of this year's grass-court champions, Queen's winner Tatjana Maria, 3-6, 7-6(4), 6-1. Maria served for the match at 5-4 in the second set. Following Wang Xinyu's 7-5, 6-3 upset of No. 15 seed Karolina Muchova, a brand-new Wimbledon quarterfinalist is now guaranteed from this section of the draw.

Four out of this year's six grass-court titlists have now lost in the first round of Wimbledon -- Eastbourne winner Maya Joint fell 6-3, 6-2 to No. 19 seed Liudmila Samsonova. The two remaining are Berlin champion Marketa Vondrousova (who defeated Nottingham winner McCartney Kessler on Monday) and 's-Hertogenbosch champion Elise Mertens.

Elisabetta Cocciaretto's 58-minute win over Pegula is the fastest win against a Top 5 seed at a major since 2022 -- and only the second Top 10 win of her career.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

Day 2 of Wimbledon kicked off with the biggest upset of the 2025 Championships thus far as No. 3 seed Jessica Pegula fell in the first round in under an hour to Elisabetta Cocciaretto, 6-2, 6-3.Pegula arrived to the All England Club days after winning her second career grass-court title at the Bad Homburg Open, but couldn't convert the momentum into a Wimbledon run against the No. 116th-ranked Coacciaretto, who advanced on No. 2 Court in 58 minutes flat.The 31-year-old American enjoyed a Grand Slam breakthrough in 2024 when she reached her first Grand Slam final at the US Open, but she has not made it past the fourth round in her three subsequent major main-draw appearances despite solid results on all surfaces this season. Though her Roland Garros campaign ended abruptly in the fourth round when she fell in three sets to French wild card Loïs Boisson, who went on to reach the semifinals, Pegula looked back in form on grass when she won the title in Bad Homburg.

The 31-year-old American enjoyed a Grand Slam breakthrough in 2024 when she reached her first Grand Slam final at the US Open, but she has not made it past the fourth round in her three subsequent major main-draw appearances despite solid results on all surfaces this season. Though her Roland Garros campaign ended abruptly in the fourth round when she fell in three sets to French wild card Loïs Boisson, who went on to reach the semifinals, Pegula looked back in form on grass when she won the title in Bad Homburg.

In the final pre-Wimbledon warm-up event, Pegula scored a straight-sets victory over former world No. 1 Iga Swiatek to win her ninth WTA title, but was out of sorts from the outset against Cocciaretto, a former world No. 29. The 24-year-old made it to the third round of Wimbledon back in 2023—where, ironically, she lost to Pegula—and reached the semifinals of the Libéma Open in ‘s-Hertogenbosch last month, but with a 1-7 record vs. the Top 10, wasn't expected to trouble the in-form Pegula on Tuesday.Still, it was Cocciaretto with the strong start as play opened on No. 2 Court, the Italian breaking Pegula twice to capture the opening set.Pegula kept things closer in the second set but netted a backhand down break point to hand Cocciaretto a 4-3 lead, one the unseeded underdog converted into her first career Top 5 victory. Cocciaretto became the first Italian woman to defeat a Top 3 seed at Wimbledon in the Open Era, and the first Italian woman to defeat a Top 3 seed at any major tournament since 2015 when Flavia Pennetta and Roberta Vinci upset Simona Halep and Serena Williams, respectively, to reach that year's final.Pegula's exit opens up the bottom half of the draw for fellow seeds Swiatek, 2022 champion Elena Rybakina, and two-time Grand Slam finalist Karolina Muchova, all of whom shared a quarter with the American. They will all be in action later on Tuesday.

Designed by Jason Badden in collaboration with then-sponsor Nike, the cream-colored cardigan was completely custom-made. Every detail was personalized, down to the wooden buttons that were hand-carved with his “RF” logo and references to his five men's singles titles.The outfit set off a frenzy of debate. Was it too much hubris for the normally understated Federer? How did cream and gold fit into the All England Club's dress code? Either way, the look became iconic—immortalized not only in tennis lore, but also at the Rafa Nadal Museum in Mallorca, where it's been displayed alongside the Spaniard's gear from their epic 2008 final.Alcaraz, meanwhile, is one of several Nike representatives who hit the courts on Monday sporting the 2025 London Collection cardigan. There's no custom logo for the Spaniard yet, although it's rumored to be in the works. Instead, the NikeCourt logo patch and five-button closure give the garment a classic look, while intentional distressing gives it a grungy twist.

The lighter poly-blend fabric also came through during a soaring Day 1, which saw temperatures set a new record high. Alcaraz kept his cool to survive the opening scare against Fognini, winning 7-5, 6-7 (1), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1. It's the first time a defending champion has been pushed to five sets in the opening round since Federer himself in 2010.“I think battling the heat is one of the things that we have to do (as tennis players),” Alcaraz told press afterward. “I think we have to deal with it in the best way possible.”Alcaraz, the No. 2 seed, will be back in action on Wednesday to face British qualifier Oliver Tarvet in the second round.

On the hottest day in Wimbledon history, Carlos Alcaraz had his feet to the fire. The two-time defending champion was given all he could handle by former Top 10 player Fabio Fognini, playing in his final Wimbledon, on Day 1 at the All England Club but survived a five-set first round in more than four hours on Centre Court, 7-5, 6-7(5), 7-5, 6-1.As air temperatures soared past 90 degrees Fahrenheit, Alcaraz was just the third reigning men's champion in the Open Era taken to five sets in his first round match the next year, following Roger Federer in 2010 (against Alejandro Falla) and Bjorn Borg in 1978 (against Victor Amaya) thanks to the combination of an off-kilter start from his side and a vintage performance by the 38-year-old Fognini, who entered Wimbledon on an 11-match losing streak at tour level.But after four sets that lasted nearly four hours, Alcaraz found a more consistent level against a fading Fognini to avoid becoming just the third reigning Wimbledon men's champion to lose his first match the following year in four hours and 38 minutes, and avoid losing in the first round of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time.While Alcaraz admitted his play could've been better, he first paid deep respects to the Italian veteran 16 years his senior who reached his best ranking of No. 9 in 2019.""To be honest, I don't know why it's his last Wimbledon, because the level he just showed, he can still play three, four more years,"" Alcaraz said. ""I have to give him the credit of a great match. He's a great player; he has shown during his whole career the level and the talent that he has ... so I'm a little bit sad that it was his Wimbledon, but happy to have shared the court with him and the locker room with him.""

Alcaraz hit 62 unforced errors in total, 35 of which came off of his forehand. The up-and-down nature of his play was evident in the middle of the match, though he neve trailed on the sets-won scoreboard. The first nine games of the match went with serve before Alcaraz won the last three in a row, and in set three, he regrouped after losing a 5-3 lead to forge ahead two-sets-to-one.But he only hit three errors in the final set, where play was stopped for nearly 15 minutes after three games as a result of a spectator medical issue. Alcaraz had previously broken Fognini for 2-0 from 40-15 behind, and later saved two break points to lead 3-0. Out of the break, he broke again from 40-0.""Playing the first match on Centre Court is never easy,"" he confessed. ""I've been practicing pretty well, I've been playing on grass pretty well, but Wimbledon is special. It's different. I could feel the difference between Wimbledon and the other tournaments. I just tried to play my best ... but I will say I could be better, I have to improve. In general, I think it was a great match.""Alcaraz is now 14-1 in five set matches in his career, a mark which includes the nearly five-and-a-half hour epic he won against Jannik Sinner earlier this month to triumph at Roland Garros.

These days, the bigger the tennis tournament, the longer it takes to get going. Three of the majors have added a leisurely opening Sunday, while the Masters 1000s now last 12 days instead of nine. Which means the stars may not appear until the tournament is a third of the way through.So it was jarring—and refreshing—to see a solid wall of well-known names on the Monday's schedule at Wimbledon. Alcaraz, Sabalenka, Zverev, Paolini, Medvedev, Fritz, Tiafoe, Keys, among others, were in action right away.Some of them might have wished they weren't. This was the hottest first day on record—temperatures topped out in the low 90s—and it didn't take long for a few of the seeds to look a little dazed in it. Some survived, others didn't.Here are three takeaways from a fiery first Monday.

The heat was certainly on early in Centre Court. The first match, between Carlos Alcaraz and Fabio Fognini, had to be halted when a fan collapsed in the fifth set. Alcaraz, stand-up guy that he is, brought the person water.By then, the Spaniard had mostly extricated himself from his own hot water on court. He led Fognini 3-0 in the fifth, and would go on to win 7-5, 6-7 (5), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1.A win is a win, of course, and Alcaraz duly credited Fognini: “The talent that Fabio has is immense.” Still, the Italian is 38, in his final season, and was 0-6 in tour-level matches so far in 2025. Considering that Alcaraz was on an 18-match win streak coming in, this match was closer than it needed to be.Read More: Fabio Fognini in Rome ""with a smile in my face"" after confirming final professional seasonHeat and first-round Wimbledon nerves, Alcaraz said, had a lot to do with it.“Obviously, physically is difficult; part of the match you can feel down a little bit because of the sun hitting all the time,” he said.“I could feel today that I was really nervous at the beginning.

Ups and downs have always been part of the Alcaraz experience. He has even started to call these types of matches his roller-coasters. So far, he has enjoyed the rides with almost no consequences. He's now 14-1 in five-setters. Last year at Wimbledon, he beat France Tiafoe in five on his way to the title. In this year's Roland Garros final, he didn't really lift his game to its top level until he was down triple match point.Against Fognini, it took Alcaraz four sets to fully impose his will. Once he did, he cruised. But there were some perplexing moments along the way, and he let the Italian hang around for two extra sets before slamming the door.Alcaraz, it seems, has trouble manufacturing motivation and urgency on certain days. To focus, he has to feel it for real; he has to feel like he might lose before he can win.For most of us, that's a dangerous way to live. By now, though, Alcaraz has played this way long enough that an early-round scare doesn't faze him. “Survive, advance, improve” could be his Slam motto. Who can argue with the results?“I think it was great,” he said of his long match today. “Really proud about getting through and giving myself a chance to be better in the next round.”

Was this just one loss, or does it signal more long-term trouble for Medvedev, who made the semis at Wimbledon the last two years?© 2025 Getty Images

If you were looking for an encapsulation of Medvedev's 7-6 (2), 3-6, 7-6 (3), 6-2 loss to Benjamin Bonzi in a single gesture, the Russian had you covered.Down a break point in the third set, Medvedev took a backhand down the line and did something surprising, at least for him: He followed it in. What happened next was more predictable: Bonzi fired a forehand back up the line, and Medvedev's volley landed in the bottom of the net.Broken, Medvedev turned to his team, threw both his hands forward, and gave his coach a sarcastic thumbs up. The message was clear: “Thanks a lot for telling me to move in; brilliant idea.”To be fair to his coach, it was hard to think of a better strategy. Bonzi was winning because he was more aggressive, especially in the tiebreakers. Medvedev's usual strengths—defense, consistency, serve—weren't doing the trick. And the rallies only got more one-sided as the Frenchman ran away with the fourth set. He won 57 percent of Medvedev's second-serve points, while Medvedev double-faulted 12 times.

Was this just one loss, or does it signal more long-term trouble for a guy who made the semis at Wimbledon the last two years? While Medvedev's ranking will take a hit, he opted for the positive view. He credited Bonzi, and said his own run to the final in Halle last week reassured him that his “top level” is still reachable.“Not too worried,” Medvedev said. “I'm for sure very disappointed about the fact that I lost. It's OK. Now hard courts. If I manage to play like I did in Halle, honestly even like I did today, I do feel like I can come back to Top 10. I have not much points to defend till the end of the year.”All of that is true. Medvedev is also 29, which is not as old as it used to be. On the other hand, it has been two years since his last title. The real problem may be this: Bonzi is a mid-level player, but his attack was still more than enough to beat Medvedev. With Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner leading the way, the tour is trending in an aggressive direction. And Medvedev isn't going to get any quicker in his 30s.

In the early years of Keys' career, Wimbledon seemed to me like the Slam she would most likely win. At some point, that serve and those ground strokes would click on grass, and no would stand a chance. This isn't how it worked out. Keys is 26-10 at Wimbledon—not bad—but has only made the quarters twice. The Australian Open, it turned out, was where she finally clicked.I'm not holding my breath for her to repeat that run at the All England Club; she could play Sabalenka in the quarters. But her title in Melbourne may already have made her a more clutch performer at the majors. Keys saved match points to beat Sofia Kenin in the third round at Roland Garros, and today she squeaked out a tight three-setter, 6-7 (4), 7-5, 7-5, over a resilient Elena-Gabriela Ruse, who matched Keys shot for shot and pace for pace the whole way.“I think she's a really great player,” Keys said of the 58th-ranked Ruse. “I think matchup-wise it's just kind of one of those matches where we can have tough battles.”Keys had a lot to contend with against Ruse. Heat, first-round nerves, an opponent who likes her game—and who threw in an underhand serve. The American also served for the each of the last two sets, and was broken. The second time, at break point, Ruse hit a stab backhand that bounced on Keys' side of the net, and then bounced back over to Ruse's side. Keys took a swing at it, but ended up crashing into the net instead.

Fifteen years on tour will let you know that you can't dwell on anything, even a disaster like that.

The Channel Slam is one of the trickiest double headers in sports as tennis players face the daunting challenge of switching from Roland Garros clay to Wimbledon grass in under three weeks at the end of a long European tour.“You really cannot play the same style of tennis, necessarily, as effectively,” said former world No. 1 Jim Courier on Tennis Channel Live Monday.“You've got to be ready for the frustration—at least I did—of not being able to play comfortably. It's an awkward, uncomfortable surface. You just have to hate it a little bit less than your opponent. At least, that was my philosophy.”Courier won back-to-back Roland Garros titles in 1991 and 1992 but the four-time Grand Slam champion was unable to lift the Wimbledon trophy, reaching the final just once in 1993.

Roland Garros champion Carlos Alcaraz made a seamless transition to grass last year when he won the 2024 Channel Slam, and the Spaniard kicked off his Wimbledon title defense with a four-hour first-round marathon with Fabio Fognini.“The mental reset is such a challenge when you put everything into winning a Grand Slam or doing the best you can, you kind of feel empty when it's over, win or lose,” said Lindsay Davenport, who won Wimbledon in 1999. “You can barely take days off before you get back in the mode of getting your game back ready for the next major.“There are big differences between playing on clay and playing on grass. You have to flatten out your groundstrokes and take balls earlier. You've got to try and look to move forward. So, there's a huge adjustment there.”

Alcaraz ultimately adjusted in time to pass the Fognini test on Centre Court while Roland Garros women's runner-up Aryna Sabalenka eased through her first round against Canadian qualifier Carson Branstine in straight sets. Women's singles champion Coco Gauff plays her first round at Wimbledon on Tuesday against Dayana Yastremska.Prakash Amritraj noted the European grind on U.S. players, who face a tough decision about whether to remain abroad after Roland Garros or hang on until after Wimbledon.“You can't have any kind of a reset here,” said Amritraj. “Some players can go home after Australia or have a little bit of a break after Wimbledon before starting up for the U.S. swing. Here, it makes it logistically very challenging. One of the things I ask all the American players is, ‘Are you going to go home?' A lot of them end up staying all the way through, and that's a whole different thing to wrap your head around at the start of a trip than it is for the other Slams.“Maybe like the micro nap, you need the micro-trip to Ibiza?” joked Courier, referencing Alcaraz's annual post-Roland Garros vacation.“If it works for Carlos…” rejoined Amritraj.

2025 Austrian Grand Prix: Tsunoda handed a penalty after tipping Colapinto into a spin

Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto give their opinions on a difficult Austrian Grand Prix for Alpine.

Pierre Gasly endured a ""long"" and ""frustrating"" Austrian Grand Prix as the Alpine driver was unable to capitalise on a strong start, coming home 13th while team mate Franco Colapinto finished two places further back.

With Gasly running sixth at the end of the opening lap in Spielberg, there were high hopes for a significant number of points for Alpine. However, after starting on the soft tyres, the Frenchman was forced into an early pit stop – with his race unravelling afterwards.

Calling it “a very disappointing afternoon,” Gasly was unable to explain why he then could not extract much pace from either the hard or medium compound tyres on Sunday, despite the majority of the teams going well on those compounds.

“We have a lot to understand and analyse as I just felt a lack of grip all race and really struggled across all the stints,” Gasly said.

“I am not sure why, maybe some damage to the car, maybe not, but we need to review this one in detail as it was a very long afternoon and a frustrating outcome.

“We had a very good start, up to sixth place at the end of the first lap. After that, there is not much to say other than it being a difficult race.

""We move onto Silverstone straight away now for the home race of Enstone. It is always a fantastic event and one I look forward to going to, this time aiming to bounce back from this tough weekend.”

Gasly wasn't the only frustrated Alpine driver at the end of a hot race in Austria, with Colapinto also enduring a long afternoon. He was tagged into a spin by Yuki Tsunoda at one point, and then picked up a five-second penalty for forcing Oscar Piastri off the track.

“I had the incident with Tsunoda at Turn 4, which set us back a bit and lost us some time,” said Colapinto. ""Yuki came to me and said sorry afterwards, but it's a pity as the car felt different following the contact, potentially due to some damage.""

On his moment with Piastri, who was lapping him at the time, Colapinto explained: “He was in my blind spot. After the contact with Tsunoda, I just wanted to pass him and I was not really focused on Oscar.”

Alpine remain rooted to the bottom of the Teams' Championship table, 15 points adrift of Kick Sauber, who managed to score with both cars in Austria.

2025 Austrian Grand Prix: Tsunoda handed a penalty after tipping Colapinto into a spin

Red Bull endured a difficult home race at the Austrian Grand Prix, with Max Verstappen eliminated on the first lap and Yuki Tsunoda the final finisher.

Christian Horner was left to rue a “very frustrating” sequence of events in Sunday's Austrian Grand Prix after Red Bull left their home race without scoring any points.

Max Verstappen completed only two corners at the Red Bull Ring before being taken out of the action by Mercedes rival Kimi Antonelli, who misjudged his approach to Turn 3 and subsequently earned a three-place grid penalty for Silverstone.

Yuki Tsunoda, meanwhile, was the final finisher in 16th position, having struggled to make an impression after his Q1 exit and been given a 10-second penalty for tipping Franco Colapinto's Alpine into a spin exiting Turn 4.

The result means Red Bull fall even further behind their rivals in the Teams' Championship, holding 162 points to McLaren's 417, while Verstappen is 61 adrift of Oscar Piastri in the Drivers' standings.

“A frustrating day,” Red Bull team boss Horner summed up on F1 TV's post-race show. “Starting with Max, he had a great start and was well-positioned for Turn 1. At Turn 3 unfortunately Kimi just lost control and wiped him out. Very frustrating… Obviously Kimi's apologised. It is what it is.

“I think when you look at the pace, we wouldn't have fought the McLarens today, but we'd have fought the Ferraris hard, for sure. George [Russell] had no pace. It was frustrating.

“With Yuki, it's difficult to make progress starting where he did on the grid, then picking up a penalty as well with Colapinto. A horrible race for him today as well. Frustrating, but we'll move on quickly to Silverstone.”

With that in mind, Horner was asked how Red Bull can “remedy” the struggles several drivers have now faced in the seat alongside Verstappen – and ensure that both cars are in a position to score points moving forward.

“We need to understand with Yuki what's gone wrong [this weekend],” he continued. “FP1 and FP2, certainly FP2 and FP3, he was looking okay. Qualifying it seemed to fall apart for him.

“When you're out of position, you're down the pack like that, when it's so tight… he's struggling, I think he's struggling for confidence. But we'll work with him, we'll try and help him through it.

“The car is… it's a car that's evolved over the years around the development path that we've taken. It isn't an easy car to drive, but it's not that difficult either. We'll work with him and hopefully it'll make a step up in Silverstone.”

Given the significant gaps that have developed in both championships, Horner knows Verstappen and Red Bull now face a tall order to add to their recent title successes in 2025.

“Well, look, the championship we're not even thinking about,” he conceded. “We're just focused on each race now. They're [McLaren] a long way out of touch. We'll just take things race by race.

Verstappen has won the last four Drivers' titles on the bounce, while Red Bull were crowned Teams' champions in 2022 and 2023 before being overhauled by McLaren last season.

McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella gives his take on the Austrian Grand Prix, where the papaya team brought home a clinical 1-2 finish.

Andrea Stella was full of his praise for his drivers during a 'tense' Austrian Grand Prix, as McLaren title protagonists Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri battled for the lead with the Briton eventually sealing victory.

It was a two-horse race for the win at the Red Bull Ring once Piastri made his way past Ferrari's Charles Leclerc at the start of the Grand Prix, the Australian then harrying and pushing polesitter Norris on in the first stint.

In a thrilling exchange in the early stages Norris was unable to break the DRS, and was vulnerable for lap after lap to his team mate, something that will have heightened the heart rates on the McLaren pit wall given the duo's collision in the Canadian Grand Prix.

As the fight for the lead went on Piastri did manage to briefly overtake for first place, only to see Norris cut straight back past. Then came arguably the championship leader's best opportunity as he out-braked Norris into Turn 4 – only to lock up, and narrowly avoid contact.

McLaren pitted Norris soon after, and then their strategies diverged – Piastri staying out before emerging from his own pit stop six seconds adrift of his team mate later on, with McLaren then able to enjoy a slightly less fraught race.

Piastri never got back into DRS for the remainder of the Grand Prix, with Norris going on to win his third race of the season.

“It was intense racing, but that is what we are here for, to race,” Stella explained.

“It was an open race today and here in Austria it is a special track as, when you get the DRS, you stay hooked to the car ahead and this is what happened in the first stint, as the pace between Lando and Oscar was very similar.

“So, this is what happened, they stayed together throughout the stint and Oscar had a couple of chances. We are very happy and proud of how they handled the situation.

“We needed to give Oscar a bit of advice in terms of the manoeuvre in Turn 4, which he once again acknowledged. So, I'm proud of him for how he said straight after the chequered flag that he was sorry for that manoeuvre, he went a little too far. It's not easy, it is Formula 1, he is racing, he is racing hard but it is a good day.”

Piastri remains in the lead of the Championship, but Norris has closed the gap down to just 15 points following his Spielberg triumph. With Max Verstappen failing to finish, the McLaren pair have a commanding lead over the rest in what is shaping up to be a straight intra-team fight for the title.

“They are obviously stressful moments, but we trust, we rely on Oscar and Lando and also once we are on the pit wall you just try and stay as chilled as possible and analyse rationally what is going on,” Stella added, reflecting on the pairs on-track battles.

“But for us, it was clear that the guys needed to have the opportunity to give the race, both, as long as they do it in the way they have done it today. It is a great spectacle for Formula 1.

""We are happy that we entertain our fans, our spectators and we look forward to more races like this even if, yes, it gave us some nervousness on the pit wall. But that is what we are here for.”

Following McLaren's 1-2 result in Austria, the Woking-based squad have an even more commanding lead in the Teams' Championship, 207 points ahead of Ferrari.

2025 Austrian Grand Prix: Tsunoda handed a penalty after tipping Colapinto into a spin

Months on from his last F1 race at the 2024 Singapore Grand Prix, Daniel Ricciardo has given his take on how he is feeling about his current situation.

Daniel Ricciardo has given an update on his situation following his exit from the F1 grid in 2024, with the Australian admitting that he is “enjoying some life in the slow lane” several months on from his last race.

Ricciardo faced a tumultuous few years in the sport in recent times, having been left without a seat entering into 2023 when a difficult spell at McLaren resulted in the mutual decision to terminate his contract early at the end of 2022.

He then returned to the Red Bull stable as a reserve driver before being drafted in to replace Nyck de Vries at the then-named AlphaTauri squad – now known as Racing Bulls – midway through 2023.

While he remained with the outfit into 2024, the driver from Perth struggled to return to his form of old and was replaced by Liam Lawson for the remainder of the campaign following the Singapore Grand Prix.

Ricciardo – who turns 36 today – has not raced since then but has continued to be involved in supporting youngsters in motorsport through the Daniel Ricciardo Series, in which young drivers compete at the wheel of a DRS Ricciardo Kart across events held in the United Kingdom.

The eight-time race winner was in attendance during the latest round at Buckmore Park over the weekend and, when quizzed on how he is getting on at the moment, gave a positive response as he reflected on how his current venture reminds him of his early racing days.

“All good!” said Ricciardo. “I'm just enjoying some life in the slow lane. I mean, it sounds weird saying like retirement when I'm 35 years old, but retirement from at least the world I was living in. It's cool.

“To be at the kart track… it's my first time at a race track since I guess Singapore, so quite a few months now. But it's cool to see the kids… this is why I started karting…

“I've had photos with groups of the kids and I can tell the friendships they have, and these friendships will last a lifetime a lot of them. My best friend to this day was a friend that I raced karts with. It's nice to be back at like the grassroots of it and the most pure form of racing.”

With young karters at the track keen to meet Ricciardo, the former Red Bull driver admitted that he has been able to appreciate what it felt like as a youngster in the sport since taking some time away.

“I think now that I'm a bit removed from it and life is not as chaotic, it's nice to remember what it was like to be at the start of the career,” he explained. “We all have idols and heroes…

“I would be very nervous meeting someone who I admired, so I understand sometimes it's a bit overwhelming. But everyone seems pretty cool. I guess maybe I'm not the only driver they've met before – there's a lot of F1 fans here!

“I think just to have someone that you want to try and obviously look up to and someone that can inspire you… if I'm able to sprinkle a tiny bit of inspiration or motivation today by being here and having a chat to a few kids, that's awesome. That's something I know I appreciated when I was eight, nine, 10 years old.”

Ricciardo also took a moment to reflect on the one piece of advice that he wished he had received when he was the age of those now in karting.

“I mean, I think I was quite lucky with the advice,” the Australian conceded. ""It was always just, ‘Go and have fun'. It wasn't about trying to impress someone or be someone you're not. ‘If you do this you'll be on TV and make money'. It wasn't about that, it was just, ‘Go and have fun'.

“It kind of helped me also… like racing is scary, you know? I think it helped me at school have a bit more confidence. Everyone's shy, we all go through things growing up, so I think it kind of gave me confidence in myself as a person, also away from the track. So, that's something I took from it.

“But as far as the driving goes, honestly it was just about me having fun. I was playing with my friends [at the track], we were riding scooters and stuff, and my dad was always dragging me like, ‘The kart's on the grid, put your helmet on!' The karting was kind of secondary a lot of the time. It was just to be in this environment with friends.”

2025 Austrian Grand Prix: Tsunoda handed a penalty after tipping Colapinto into a spin

Mercedes endured a difficult Austrian Grand Prix as Kimi Antonelli crashed out on the first lap and George Russell finished a distant fifth.

Toto Wolff was left to rue a challenging Austrian Grand Prix for Mercedes after Kimi Antonelli's first-lap collision with Max Verstappen and George Russell's lonely run to fifth position.

Winners last time out at the Canadian Grand Prix, Mercedes continued where they left off with a pace-setting display in first practice at the Red Bull Ring, but that would prove to be the high point of their weekend.

After Qualifying fifth and ninth respectively, Mercedes' hopes of turning the situation around were severely dented at the start of the race when Antonelli lost control of his car under braking for Turn 3 and collected Red Bull rival Verstappen.

From there, Russell was the Silver Arrows' sole representative and had to settle for converting his starting position – finishing a minute behind the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.

Asked to reflect on the race, beginning with Antonelli's incident, which earned the rookie a three-place grid drop, Mercedes boss Wolff said: “We always knew that eventually… No, I word it differently. These mistakes happen.

“The rears blocked on the car. I'm not entirely sure it was his [Antonelli's] fault or a system. I haven't seen any data or heard anything, because obviously we were concentrating on the race. But that happens, you know.

“It's unfortunate for Max and Red Bull that Kimi hit him, but it's racing.”

Asked if he had spoken with Antonelli about what happened, Wolff shared: “Yeah, he came into the garage quickly. I said, ‘Well, that wasn't great', which he obviously knew, but he said the tyres just blocked and we need to analyse that.

“It's a shame that Max… that we took another car out with us, but that can happen to the great ones, to the inexperienced ones, to the experienced ones – it's just part of F1.”

Wolff then reflected on Mercedes' wider weekend performance, having gone from pole position and victory with Russell in cooler Montreal conditions to finishing third-best behind McLaren and Ferrari amid the Spielberg heat.

“When you look at our performance last year, we won, we won the race here,” said Wolff, pointing to Russell capitalising on Verstappen and Norris' clash. “We were, I don't remember, 10-15 seconds behind the leaders, and that was a very solid performance.

“This year we're a minute behind the leaders, so that is clearly out of the ordinary what happened today. We do experiment at the moment a little bit, how to position, how to put the car on track, where we put the balance, and clearly this one we got wrong – and we know that.

“I think it's not only down to asphalt, long corners and heat. Clearly that's not our sweet spot, but it doesn't explain the gap, and I think we know why, but in hindsight you always know.”

Mercedes dropped back to third in the Teams' Championship standings following Sunday's race, a point behind Ferrari, who scored strongly with Charles Leclerc in P3 and Lewis Hamilton in P4.

Research shows Gen Z, women, and US audiences are leading new era of modern F1 fandom.

Formula 1 and Motorsport Network – the world's largest motorsport media company – have released the 2025 Global F1 Fan Survey, a study conducted every four years to track how fan engagement is evolving across the sport globally.

The survey was launched earlier this year and, based on more than 100,000 responses from self-identified, highly engaged fans in 186 countries, the findings offer a detailed snapshot of the modern fan mindset and show that Formula 1 is increasingly attracting a new, younger and more female audience, with growth in markets such as the United States.

The research shows that fans are increasingly drawn to Formula 1 by the breadth of stories and the variety of ways to engage with the sport – and they're staying for the speed, strategy, and spectacle. Digital highlights and the full white paper are available to download and view.

“This study shows that fans are increasingly following Formula 1 for the stories and the many opportunities to engage with the sport, and then they're becoming hooked on the fantastic racing,” said Stefano Domenicali, President & CEO of Formula 1.

“The sport is embedded in culture now, via streaming, storytelling, and social media, and that's helping more people connect. With Motorsport Network, we've been able to take a deeper look at what modern fandom really looks like in 2025 and ensure our strategy to bring in new fans remains on track.”

Werner Brell, CEO of Motorsport Network, added: “This survey isn't just a snapshot – it's a signal to the marketplace. Gen Z, women, and US fans are driving an always-on, connected, and culturally powerful era for F1. It points to how we can better serve fans, connect them with partners, and seize the biggest commercial opportunities for the sport's future.”

The full study spans eight chapters, covering emotional motivators and content engagement to live experiences, lifestyle signals, and sponsorship impact. It offers insights to help better understand and serve F1's most engaged fans – and a view into the future of sports fandom more broadly.

Gen Z is helping shape the rhythm of modern fandom, engaging with the sport more frequently and on a deeper emotional level. Two-thirds of survey respondents say they feel personally inspired by F1 drivers or teams, and in the US 70% of the study's Gen Z respondents engage with F1 content daily – especially through streaming video and social media.

Female fans now account for three in four new fans. Most are newer to the sport and skew younger, with nearly half of all Gen Z respondents being women.

With the largest country share of survey respondents, fans in the US continue to stand out for their growth, youth, and digital fluency. They over-index on content engagement, sponsor responsiveness, and daily touchpoints, signalling a market where fandom is evolving rapidly and is commercially primed.

Among respondents:

Modern F1 fandom is emotional, participatory, and always-on

Formula 1 fans aren't just watching, they're investing, interacting, and engaging with the sport frequently. Among surveyed fans, 90% say they're emotionally invested in race outcomes and 61% engage with F1 content daily. Across platforms and time zones, surveyed fans are shaping a continuous connection to the sport – one that reflects a more dynamic, always-on relationship with Formula 1.

The thrill unites

Across all audience segments, speed and performance remain the most powerful motivators, with 90% of respondents saying they're emotionally invested in race outcomes.

Fans are committed and intend to stay

Among surveyed fans, commitment runs deep. 94% say they intend to follow Formula 1 five years from now, and 86% watch 16 or more races per season.

Content is the new entry point and emotional driver for engagement

Many newer and younger fans are discovering Formula 1 through social media, streaming series, and shared content – entry points that now shape how they connect with the sport. They are more likely to form identity-based connections with Formula 1, citing driver personalities and narrative drama as key drivers of engagement. 70% of Gen Z respondents feel that Formula 1 represents a status or image that appeals to them.

Sponsorship drives consideration

76% of respondents believe sponsors enhance the F1 experience. One in three are more likely to purchase from F1 partners, with favourability rising to 40% among Gen Z respondents.

Live experiences deepen connection

Intent to attend Formula 1 events is rising. 41% of surveyed fans who haven't attended an F1 fan experience plan to do so in the future. From Grands Prix to pop-ups, brand activations, exhibitions, and arcade-style venues, fans are increasingly seeking immersive ways to engage with the sport live and in-person.

F1 ACADEMY signals a new kind of growth

23% of surveyed fans say they follow F1 ACADEMY, and among women that rises to 42%, making it the second-most-followed series after Formula 1 itself. The all-female racing platform is gaining momentum among newer audiences too, with 37% of Gen Z and 36% of newer respondents engaging – underscoring the demand for inclusive storytelling and representation on the grid.

United States: a growth market to watch

The United States accounted for the largest country share of survey respondents, offering a lens into one of Formula 1's most dynamic national markets. While Europe remains the largest region overall, the US stands out for accelerating fan growth, especially among younger, digital-first audiences.

Among US-based participants:

Christian Horner has offered his response after being quizzed on reports Mercedes are having 'conversations' with Max Verstappen, amid George Russell's contract discussions with the team.

Christian Horner has had his say on the reports that Mercedes are having ""conversations"" with Red Bull's Max Verstappen about a possible switch, calling it “a lot of noise” as the chatter intensified in Austria.

The reports rose to the surface in Spielberg amid the situation surrounding George Russell's contract discussions at the Silver Arrows, with the Briton's current deal expiring at the end of 2025.

When quizzed in Austria about the process of agreeing a new deal, Russell stated that he was more focused on performance than “pressing massively” to get something signed, despite conceding that “it does help if there was pen on paper”.

He also went on to tell Sky Sports F1 that it was ""only normal that conversations with the likes of Verstappen are ongoing"".

Verstappen himself also dismissed the talk over the weekend in Austria, instead wanting to focus on racing – while his boss Horner was also questioned about the reports.

“It is a lot of noise, and I think Max [Verstappen] gets quite annoyed by it,” Horner told Sky Sports F1.

“We are very clear with the contract we have with Max until 2028. Anything is entirely speculative that has been said. We tend to not pay too much attention to it.

“I can imagine George is frustrated that he hasn't been given a contract yet, but that's between him and his team.

“The situation with Max – we know clearly where we are at, as does Max. Everything is subject to noise and obviously within the contract remains confidential to the two parties.”

Amid the continued speculation, Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff asserted that it was still the case he and Russell wanted to continue the partnership, but recognised the team still needed to have certain conversations.

“[We're] absolutely keen to continue the relationship,” said Wolff in Austria.

“Everything goes its normal course – we have agreed on timings and we're absolutely within that framework, and it's clear silly season starts now.”

""Some conversations you just simply need to have, but it doesn't change my fundamental opinion about how the team is going to go forwards.”

Ahead of becoming Audi's works team in 2026, Sauber have opened their new Technology Centre at Bicester Motion in the United Kingdom.

Sauber have announced the opening of their new Technology Centre based at Bicester Motion in the United Kingdom, marking the next step in the squad's transition into Audi's Formula 1 works outfit in 2026.

With the 444-acre Bicester Motion located in an area known as Motorsport Valley in the Midlands and South East of the country – due to this being where seven of F1's 10 teams are based – Sauber say that the facility will “provide a base for the team to benefit from the expertise within the region and support the Audi F1 Project's HQ in Hinwil, Switzerland, to create a cohesive and integrated approach to all aspects of the project”.

The primary purpose of the Bicester centre in Building 123 is to “enhance and expand the team's technical capabilities, to ensure the team is well-positioned to attract top engineering talent and foster partnerships with leading industry supply chain specialists”.

Sauber previously announced their intention to open the centre earlier in the year as preparations ramp up for their transformation into becoming the Audi F1 factory team from 2026 onwards.

Mattia Binotto, Head of Audi F1 Project, said: ""The opening of the Sauber Motorsport Technology Centre at Bicester Motion is a significant milestone as we prepare for Audi's arrival in Formula 1.

“This facility will allow us to tap into the talent pool in Motorsport Valley and further strengthen our technical capabilities while being part of a thriving cluster at Bicester Motion where you live and breathe motorsport.

“The support it will play to Hinwil will be important to our long-term success.”

Daniel Geoghegan, Chief Executive Officer, Bicester Motion, added: “We warmly welcome Sauber Motorsport in what is an exciting step in its Audi F1 transformation ahead of next year's F1 season.

“It is thrilling that Bicester Motion has been chosen as their UK base connecting into their Swiss and German operations to support their vision to deliver sustainability, innovation, and maximum performance in motorsport.

“They join many other pioneering automotive and aviation companies, along with Motorsport UK, the governing body of this great industry, already based here. We look forward to seeing their team develop and their transformation on and off the track continue.”

Liam Lawson secured sixth place for Racing Bulls in Austria, as he made an audacious one-stop strategy work on an incredibly hot day at the Red Bull Ring.

Liam Lawson was in an ecstatic mood after recording his best-ever F1 finish with sixth in the Austrian Grand Prix, though his race was nearly over before it started on the opening lap.

The Racing Bulls driver came close to being taken out by Mercedes rookie Kimi Antonelli in Turn 3, with the two banging wheels as the Italian locked up and sailed straight on.

While Lawson narrowly avoided a race-ending crash, it was his former Red Bull team mate Max Verstappen instead that took the brunt of the collision, with both he and Antonelli forced to retire from the Grand Prix then and there.

Lawson put that bit of luck to good use as he went on to secure sixth, one of just two drivers to make a one-stop strategy work in Spielberg. With track temperatures passing 50C, making a set of tyres last was tricky – but Lawson was aided by having Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso on his tail.

Alonso was the second driver on a one-stop, and he was able to provide a buffer to some quicker two-stopping cars behind – even if the sight of the Spaniard in his wing mirrors all afternoon did nothing for Lawson's heart rate.

“I'm a bit lost to be honest, it was a very tough race,” Lawson told Sky Sports F1. ""Especially after Lap 1, I don't know how I survived it to be honest.

“I thought – when I saw Kimi coming I was like, okay, this is over. But somehow, we got out of it. And then the speed was good, we made the one-stop work which was key for us. With the temperatures I wasn't sure about it, but the team knew, so very, very happy.

“It is always Fernando who is behind, I think he was within DRS for 70 laps today! And you try not to make a mistake. I thought he was quicker, but I just spoke to him and he thought I was quicker, and he was using me to keep DRS!”

Lawson managed to make his hard tyres last 38 laps on Sunday, two longer than Alonso. But his team mate had an even tougher ask – Isack Hadjar made to do a 41-lap stint on his hard tyre.

That was despite the rookie two-stopping, the Frenchman forced into a very early opening stop after running wide twice on the opening lap to avoid contact. He did fight his way back up into the points, only to drop down the order late on.

At first it looked like his tyres had finally run out of life, but later Hadjar confirmed it was floor damage that prevented him scoring in Austria.

“We did a very good race,” Hadjar said. “We were comfortably in the points, and 15 laps towards the end of the race we got floor damage.

“I mean I thought P8 was secure, and then I was losing more than a second per lap. And yeah, that was a tough end to the race.”

The Racing Bulls rookie was told the damage was acquired through Turn 1, “probably the sausage kerb,” and reflected that all in all, it was a “shame.” This was the first time since Lawson returned to the team that he has managed to beat Hadjar on a Sunday, as he recorded just his second top 10 of the season.

The deals include $223 million in new financing with the goal to ""position the company to prosper from robust box office recovery.""


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	AMC Entertainment Holdings unveiled Tuesday that it has entered a “Transaction Support Agreement” with key creditor groups, debt holders and certain lenders to give it more financial flexibility, resolve key litigation and allow it to focus on box office upside.


	“The agreement reflects strong creditor support for AMC's long-term recovery and includes a comprehensive package of transactions designed to strengthen the Company's balance sheet and resolve outstanding litigation,” the firm said.




	Highlights of the agreement include: “approximately $223.3 million of new money financing that will be used to refinance debt maturing in 2026 and provide incremental liquidity, the immediate conversion of at least $143.0 million of … Senior Secured Exchangeable Notes due 2030, with the potential to equitize up to a total of $337 million …; full resolution of litigation with certain holders of AMC's 7.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2029.”

	He also touted box-office trends and outlook. “We continue to make positive advances, at a time when we also are riding the powerful wave of a recently resurgent industry-wide box office that commenced in April of this year,” he said. “The domestic box office in the second quarter of 2025 is up impressively compared to the same period last year, and our full-year industry projections point to the strongest box office performance in five years. We further anticipate more improvement in the domestic industry box office next year too, such that in our view, 2026 also will show continued growth and momentum. That's an extraordinary backdrop for AMC's ongoing recovery efforts.”

Gareth Edwards takes the directing reins while original screenwriter David Koepp returns for this chapter about an extraction team seeking genetic samples from massive creatures in a tropical biosphere.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	Dr. Henry Loomis, the paleontologist played by Jonathan Bailey in Jurassic World Rebirth, at one point laments the public's diminished interest in seeing the same old prehistoric creatures. That prompted the bottom line-driven folks at InGen, the billion-dollar biotech corporation that specializes in resurrecting extinct animals, to start crossbreeding new species. “Engineered entertainment” is what Henry calls it. The same descriptor could apply to Gareth Edwards' new chapter in the cloned dinosaur franchise birthed by Steven Spielberg more than three decades ago. There are some mighty new monsters on the prowl, but this is primarily an assembly of recycled story beats.

	Which is not to say the movie doesn't deliver adrenalized action, excitement and white-knuckle close encounters with giant beasts whose rampaging anger at times gives them a weird kinship to the cruelly exploited carnival attractions of Tod Browning's Freaks. How can you not feel a little bad for a hulking great mutant called a Distortus Rex — or D. Rex, just to make it more humiliating — with a head like a beluga whale? Men playing God rarely works out well, and these hybrid Mesozoic throwbacks have good reason to be pissed.

The Bottom Line

	
	More nostalgic than new, but still roars.
	



Release date: Wednesday, July 2Cast: Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali, Jonathan Bailey, Rupert Friend, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Ed Skrein, Luna Blaise, David Iacono, Audrina Miranda, Philippine Velge, Bechir SylvainDirector: Gareth EdwardsScreenwriter: David Koepp, based on characters created by Michael Crichton

									Rated PG-13,
								2 hours 14 minutes			






	Returning screenwriter David Koepp co-wrote the 1993 Spielberg original with sci-fi author Michael Crichton, on whose books the movies were based, as well as the 1997 sequel, The Lost World: Jurassic Park. While Koepp did not write Jurassic Park III, he had a hand in shaping the plotline. It's predominantly the first and third installments that yield the abundant déjà vu moments in Rebirth.

	











	But whatever the new movie lacks in originality, it makes up for in propulsive narrative drive, big scares and appealing new characters played by a terrific cast — even if they are mostly cut from an existing mold.


	Colin Trevorrow got the second trilogy off to a strong start in 2015 with Jurassic World, and J.A. Bayona's sequel, Fallen Kingdom, scored points for invention, switching gears into haunted-house territory. But the closing installment, Dominion, exposed a franchise gasping for creative oxygen, shifting away from creature-feature horror to ho-hum action-adventure. By going back almost to basics, Rebirth delivers on the promise of its title.


	At the end of Jurassic World Dominion, humans and dinosaurs were edging toward coexistence, with lots more prehistoric clones out in the world beyond their sanctuary. But modern-day Earth's atmosphere has proved inhospitable to the creatures, with many dying out or migrating to a tropical band around the equator that resembles their native Mesozoic Era climate. Tourism to the area is strictly prohibited.


	A prologue set 17 years before the main action takes place in a secret InGen research and development facility on Isle Saint-Hubert near Barbados. When the containment system malfunctions due to a stray Snickers wrapper, a technician watches in horror as her lab partner is ripped apart and eaten by a mostly unseen genetic dino-mutation.


	Back in the film's present, slick Big Pharma executive Martin Krebs (Rupert Friend) puts together an illegal expedition to accompany him to the island and help extract DNA from the three most gargantuan species inhabiting land, sea and air — respectively, the herbivorous titanosaurus, the aquatic mosasaurus and the flying quetzalcoatlus. Scientists at his corporation, ParkerGenix, believe those samples contain the key to revolutionary heart disease medication, worth trillions to whomever lands exclusive control.

	











	Krebs first enlists Zora Bennett (Scarlett Johansson), a tough ex-special forces operative, now a private contractor in situational security and reaction — “a mercenary,” as Dr. Loomis, who's next on the recruitment list, puts it in a good-natured dig. Still hurting from the loss of her training mission partner in Yemen, Zora sees Martin's $10 million fee as an avenue to retirement from a punishing field. (Though judging by how comfortable Johansson looks in tank tops, cargo pants and grimy sweat, Zora seems unlikely to bow out anytime soon.)


	They rendezvous in a Suriname port town with Duncan Kincaid (Mahershala Ali), captain of the Essex, a repurposed military patrol boat that will get them to Isle Saint-Hubert. Like his old friend Zora, Duncan is still pained by a tragic family loss; the two of them pull a crafty move to get Krebs to bump up Duncan's fee.


	Duncan's crew includes obnoxious head of security Bobby Atwater (Ed Skrein), Haitian co-pilot LeClerc (Bechir Sylvain) and deckhand Nina (Philippine Velge). Anticipating the order in which they become dino-snacks is a fun guessing game.


	Because it wouldn't be a Spielberg-affiliated Amblin picture without at least one kid in peril, an initially separate plot strand tracks a family sailing trip aboard La Mariposa, a sloop skippered by Reuben Delgado (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo). Since his divorce, Reuben's daughters, college-age Teresa (Luna Blaise) and 11-year-old Isabella (Audrina Miranda), have lived with their mother. The vacation is Reuben's attempt to reconnect with them, though he's not thrilled to have Teresa's lazy stoner boyfriend Xavier (David Iacono) along for the ride.

	











	In the first of the many extended action set-pieces that are director Edwards' forte, La Mariposa is sideswiped by a mosasaurus and capsized. The Essex picks up the family's mayday signal, and while Martin — gradually revealed to be the usual unscrupulous corporate creep — insists on sticking to their extraction mission, not getting sidetracked with search and rescue, he's overruled by the others.


	Koepp's script, after taking its time over character development, sticks to the recipe: Add dinosaurs and stir. That accelerates once the Essex gets hammered by a spinosaurus attack, with Teresa in a hairy close call that reveals further damning evidence of Martin's untrustworthiness. They veer into the rocky shallows of Isle Saint-Hubert, hoping the predators will be too large to follow. But they end up shipwrecked there, with the Delgado group separated from their rescuers.


	Shot (like Spielberg's original) with Panavision cameras and anamorphic lenses on 35mm, the jungles of Thailand that stand in for the island offer spectacular visuals. DP John Mathieson's dynamic shooting style keeps the pulse racing as the two parties weave their way through dense vegetation in which every unnerving sound or rustling of leaves amps up the tension.


	Given that the abandoned InGen facility runs on geothermal power from hot springs, they figure it will be the best place to get help. A gas station convenience store certainly makes it ideal for product placement — Dr. Pepper, Lay's potato chips, Cheetos, etc. — not to mention the best place to replicate the kitchen scene in Jurassic Park in which velociraptors stalk two children. This time it's a squawking quetzalcoatlus, smart enough to follow the fleeing humans into the underground tunnels that connect the village.

	











	That same pterosaur species features in a scene in which Zora and Henry rappel down a vertiginous cliff to an ancient temple carved into the rock face, where they extract a sample from a nest of quetzalcoatlus eggs. Mom is not pleased to find them in the rookery.


	Much of the humor comes from bespectacled Henry's lack of preparedness for field operations, having spent his working life in museums, and from his bantering flirtation with Zora. Bailey and Johansson, both in excellent form, inject a lot of charm into the evolving rapport between these two opposites — one an idealistic science guy, the other a swaggering combat vet who nonetheless is receptive to Henry's misgivings about the ethics of the ParkerGenix plan.


	One of the most memorable sequences — and the one that most recalls the poetic, quasi-spiritual sense of wonder in Spielberg's original — is when they reach a lush green valley full of grazing titanosauruses. Henry is like an enchanted child, dumbstruck at the sight of these gentle giants and almost unable to contain his emotions as he strokes one of the creatures' massive legs. Alexandre Desplat's rich orchestral score, incorporating John Williams' classic theme music, effectively punches up action scenes, but it's especially lovely in these tender moments.


	The other major source of heart in the movie is the growing closeness of the Delgado family. Having Isabella shocked into silence by the ordeal but rediscovering joy through a cute critter she carries in her backpack and names Dolores — a puppy-like, animatronic creature known as an aquilops — is so Spielbergian it's corny. But the sweetness is also disarming. Likewise, Reuben's increasing respect for Xavier, who turns out to have more going for him than his flaky slacker demeanor might indicate.

	











	Franchise superstar the T. Rex, with its bilious roar and tiny hands (I'm not going there), makes a welcome return. Woken from sleep on the banks of a river on which the Delgados attempt a raft escape over rapids, the massive therapod thunders after them — it swims! — in a scene that reaches peak nail-biting suspense when Isabella is separated from the group.


	The blend of physical locations with sets and digital imagery is seamless and the CG work on the creatures is first-rate, notably so in the scary climactic stretch when the lumbering D. Rex joins the fray. Edwards clearly is a devoted Spielberg fan, embedding subtle homages throughout, notably in the open water sequences that recall Jaws. Jurassic World Rebirth is unlikely to top anyone's ranked franchise list. But longtime fans (count me among them) should have a blast.

""The response to 'Prens' just shows how strong the demand for high-quality, locally produced originals is and highlights Max as the home of this type of content,"" says top executive Deniz Şaşmaz Oflaz.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	And the best-performing local original production, or LOP, for Warner Bros. Discovery‘s Max, soon-to-be-rebranded as HBO Max, globally is … drum roll, please … Turkish satire series The Prince (Prens).


	On Friday, the final episode of the third season of the hit series became available and seems to have helped seal the deal, according to company data. 




	Starring Giray Altınok as the Prince, the show is “set in the imaginary kingdom of Bongomia and follows the comedic adventures of the prince, a very unpopular member of the kingdom whose own family didn't even bother to give him a name,” according to a synopsis.

	Over the past month, the Turkish Max original achieved “the highest level of engagement of any Max local original production globally,” with 74 percent of subscribers in the country tuning in to it, according to WBD.


	Over the same period, The Prince proved to be a key driver for new subscribers, becoming “the first show that almost three in four (73 percent) of new Max users watched — the highest nominal acquisition volume for a local original production” in a country in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, company data shows.


	During its finale week, season three of The Prince accounted for 72 percent of all viewing on Max in Türkiye, WBD said, adding: “The final episode (season three episode eight), released just three days ago, became the most viewed episode of the week with 54 percent of total viewers already having watched the finale.”


WBD's transition of its streaming service BluTV to Max in Turkey became official in mid-April as the Hollywood giant underlined its “commitment to increasing its investment in local content” and “bringing a compelling slate of new local stories” to its streamer in the country.

	











	“The response to Prens just shows how strong the demand for high-quality, locally produced originals is and highlights Max as the home of this type of content,” Deniz Şaşmaz Oflaz, vp of local original productions, local channels and streaming operations lead for Türkiye, tells THR. “As one of our first original series since launching the platform direct-to-consumer in Türkiye earlier this year, it's exciting to see Prens playing a key role in attracting new viewers to the platform.”


	In a recent THR interview, she described the series this way: “It looks like a comedy, but it's more of a dramedy. … The lead character is the prince, who doesn't want to be on the throne and is not really that smart. And then we see all these typical things happening in this kingdom that we've been seeing in such series as Game of Thrones. So it's a satire.”

The news was announced during the show's reunion special, teasing that the group all auditioned for the reality show for the show's upcoming third season. 


							By 

	Nicole Fell



	Jen Affleck and Whitney Leavitt from Hulu's hit reality show The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives are joining the upcoming season of Dancing With the Stars. 


	The news was announced at the end of The Secret Wives of Mormon Wives' second season reunion special. Both women were eagerly hoping to be chosen, it appeared. The special's host, Nick Viall, shared that most of the MomTok ladies had auditioned for the season. He first announced Affleck as joining the cast, before adding a second “surprise” that Leavitt would also be joining.

	The main cast – Taylor Frankie Paul, Leavitt, Layla Taylor, Affleck, Mikayla Matthews, Mayci Neeley and Jessi Ngatikaura, Miranda McWhorter – and their husbands gathered for a drama-filled evening. Demi Engemann was noticeably absent and a large topic of conversation throughout the special as nearly all the women have publicly distanced themselves from her. Although Engemann wasn't at the reunion, she was on Viall's podcast, which was shown in clips throughout the night; the reality cast member said she couldn't attend because of a scheduling conflict.


	MomTok picked right back up on the drama that the 10-episode second season ended with. Some of the night's topics included showing receipts of the Engemann's cheating allegations and taking a hand vote on if Leavitt can take accountability on things and Leavitt's husband's past. 

	











	Despite a reentry into MomTok, Leavitt remained at-odds with several members of the group. “Newsflash, Mikayla, that's being a bully,” Leavitt shouted at her cast mate and fellow friend. Leavitt lobbed claims at McWhorter and Neeley, who both told Leavitt they have always been there with her. 


	At one point in the evening, Viall even took a hand vote to see who thought Paul takes accountability – nearly the whole group – and if Leavitt takes accountability – just McWhorter. Viall even noted that he saw times when Leavitt didn't take accountability.


	Paul's dysfunctional relationship with her now-ex Dakota Mortensen was rehashed in the reunion special. “We will never be together,” Paul told Mortensen. The central figure of MomTok shared several times that Mortensen had been unfaithful to her. 


	Engemann, despite not being present, was a massive topic of conversation. At one point during the special, someone even said, “She has no morals and values.” Leavitt, who is now close to Engemann, came to her defense several times. When Affleck shared a voice recording of Engemann telling Affleck what her story to camera should be, Leavitt acted shocked – the special, in one of its cheekier moments, showed a clip of Leavitt three hours earlier being coached by Engemann on what to say about her on camera. Affleck's husband claimed Engemann threatened the couple with a cease-and-desist. 


The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives cast members and their husbands also used the night to discuss some of the more serious topics they touched upon during the season. Leavitt's husband, Connor Leavitt, spoke about his porn addiction before bravely sharing to the audience and other members of the cast that he was raped as a child. Taylor reflected on her decision to open up during season two about her body image issues and past suicide attempts. McWhorter shared about her past sexual abuse. Despite her feud with Leavitt, she shared that Leavitt's husband reached out to encourage her to go to therapy, which lead to the two women hugging at Viall's suggestion.

	











	The reunion special ended with a first-look at season three, which kicked off Neely shouting, “MomTok survived.” In the short clip, the divide between Engemann and the rest of the group seemed to grow wide; the teaser even showing the once-feuding Engemann and Leavitt walking and holding hands before cutting to a clip of Leavitt saying she's starting her own MomTok.

Braun will remain on the board of directors and as a senior advisor to HYBE CEO Bang Si-Hyuk, but will relinquish his day-to-day responsibilities to Isaac Lee.

	Dan Rys



Scooter Braun is transitioning out of his role as CEO of HYBE America and will become an executive advisor as a director of the board and senior advisor to HYBE chairman/CEO Bang Si-Hyuk, the company announced today (July 1). In addition, Braun will be pursuing new ventures outside of HYBE while still being involved with the company.


	Braun, who is still HYBE's second-largest individual shareholder, first joined HYBE in 2021, when the South Korean company purchased his Ithaca Holdings. He then served as co-CEO of HYBE America alongside Lenzo Yoon until January 2023, when he became sole CEO; a source tells Billboard Braun's transition serves as the conclusion of his initial contract with HYBE. Succeeding him as CEO of HYBE America will be Isaac Lee, who had previously been chairman of the division and chairman of Latin America and will add the chief executive title to his remit.


	“Scooter has been an extraordinary partner, a visionary executive, and a true catalyst for cultural exchange,” Bang Si-Hyuk said in a statement. “His contributions have been vital in establishing our ambitious presence in the U.S. market. I am deeply grateful for his leadership, his astute instincts and his unwavering passion for artists. We wish him immense success in his exciting next chapter and look forward to continuing our partnership in executing HYBE's global vision.”

	As HYBE America CEO, Braun oversaw Big Machine Label Group — which he had initially purchased through Ithaca Holdings for $300 million in 2019 — and Quality Control Music, which HYBE acquired for $300 million in 2023, among other interests. He will continue to have input on several HYBE projects, including KATSEYE and Alan's Universe, as well as board-level decisions and helping the transition to Lee as CEO. His next move, while currently unknown, is said to “reflect his expansive cross-industry vision and proven ability to cultivate culture at scale while continuing a focus on his philanthropic efforts,” according to a press release.


	“Being a part of HYBE and witnessing its remarkable growth has been one of the most inspiring chapters of my professional journey,” Braun said in a statement. “Chairman Bang is a true visionary and a musical genius. What he has built with HYBE is unparalleled. I am incredibly proud of our collective accomplishments and look forward to supporting Chairman Bang and CEO Jason Jaesang Lee in their continued success as I step into what's next.”

The joint venture emerges as part of a broader trend in which music companies are teaming up with external investors to strengthen bids for music rights.

Industry News Editor


Warner Music Group and Bain Capital have announced a $1.2 billion joint venture aimed at acquiring high-profile music catalogs, including both recorded music and publishing rights. First reported by Billboard, the strategic alliance — jointly funded by both firms — aims to provide support for artists and songwriters while amplifying the impact and longevity of their creative legacies.


	The companies said on Tuesday that WMG will lead on marketing, distribution and rights administration, while the partners will jointly identify and secure catalogs. Goldman Sachs and Fifth Third Bank are acting as lead arrangers for the venture.




			Trending on Billboard		







	This collaboration combines WMG's global infrastructure with Bain Capital's investment capabilities to position the joint venture as a top destination for music assets.


	“Iconic artists and songwriters choose WMG to grow their legacies and introduce their art to new generations through impactful and innovative campaigns,” said WMG CEO Robert Kyncl. “Augmenting our deep expertise and global infrastructure with Bain Capital's financial prowess and belief in music will make us the destination of choice for preeminent catalogs.”


Angelo Rufino, a partner at Bain Capital, added: “Timeless music content continues to sit at the center of consumer entertainment. Stewardship of catalogs has never been more important as artists and songwriters deserve support to enhance the value of their work while delivering fans new and exciting collaborations.”


	The move reflects a broader industry trend, as major music companies seek outside capital to remain competitive amid rising catalog valuations and high interest rates. Catalogs have become increasingly lucrative thanks to the longevity provided by streaming platforms, where older tracks thrive through algorithmic and curated playlists. At the same time, investor caution is growing due to shifting artist preferences toward independence and more favorable deal terms.


	This joint venture also follows a string of high-profile catalog acquisitions across the industry, such as Sony Music's $1.27 billion purchase of Queen's catalog and its $625 million investment in a stake of Michael Jackson's catalog. In early 2024, Universal Music Group struck a $240 million deal with Chord Music to acquire and manage a portfolio of 60,000 music copyrights. Sony Music has also entered the fray, partnering with institutional investors like Apollo to fund similar acquisitions. WMG has been active in this space as well, having previously supported catalog ventures such as Tempo Music Group and Influence Media.


	Key to structuring this new initiative was Michael Ryan-Southern, WMG's head of corporate development and a former Goldman Sachs executive. He also led the company's $450 million acquisition of Tempo Music, which includes works by Wiz Khalifa and Florida Georgia Line.


	WMG's relationship with Bain Capital dates back to 2004, when Bain joined forces with Thomas H. Lee Partners, Edgar Bronfman Jr. and Providence Equity Partners to acquire the company in a landmark $2.6 billion cash deal.

Upcoming Beatles' projects include the release of Sam Mendes' upcoming four-part biopic.

	Thomas Smith



LONDON — The Beatles' Apple Corps Ltd. has announced that Tom Greene has been appointed as its new CEO, effective in September. 


	Apple Corps Ltd was founded in 1968 by the Fab Four to control the band's interests across music, film, publishing and more. The role of CEO was first held by the band's longtime publicist Neil Aspinall from 1968 to 2007. 


	In October 2024, his replacement Jeff Jones stepped down from the position after 17 years in the role. During his time in the role, Jones oversaw a number of projects including the band's foray into video games (The Beatles: Rock Band) and a number of films and documentaries (Ron Howard's The Beatles: Eight Days A Week – The Touring Years; Peter Jackson's Get Back series). The band released “Now and Then,” billed as their final song, in November 2024.


	Greene joins the company having previously fulfilled an operating role for the Harry Potter franchise, including stints running Pottermore Publishing and Wizarding World Digital, a joint venture between Warner Bros and Pottermore. His most recent role was as COO of Blast, an entertainment company working with the video game developers and publishers on production, commercialisation and audience growth of their esports programmes.

	Speaking on the appointment Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Olivia Harrison and Sean Ono Lennon said: “We are thrilled to welcome Tom Greene as CEO. We have a lot of exciting plans and Tom's experience and vision make him the perfect person to join us in making it all happen.”


	Tom Greene added: “It is a huge honour to lead Apple Corps into this new phase of its history. Like so many people around the world, I grew up in a household obsessed with The Beatles and their music. At a time when the world might need more of The Beatles' spirit, there are so many new and innovative ways to bring their unique magic to all generations of fans. I cannot wait to get started.”


	One of the biggest projects in Greene's in-tray will be the upcoming four-part biopic of The Beatles, the first time that the band and Apple Corps Ltd. have authorised the rights to a scripted biopic for the life story of each band member. Sam Mendes (Skyfall) will direct the Sony Pictures-produced features, with Paul Mescal (Paul McCartney), Barry Keoghan (Ringo Starr), Harris Dickinson (John Lennon) and Joseph Quinn (George Harrison) set to take the leading roles. All four films will be released in April 2028.

	As Pride Month 2025 comes to a close, it's become more clear than ever that LGBTQ+ individuals need the support of their surrounding community more than ever. When K-pop star Bain took the courageous — and mostly unheard of — move of coming out in the midst of his boy band's Los Angeles concert, the 24-year-old was not only cheered by the hundreds of fans in attendance but also supported by his JUSTB bandmates, their record label Bluedot Entertainment, U.S. touring partner The K-STAGE and, within 24 hours, several other members of the Korean-entertainment world's LGBTQ+ community.

	It's nearly a complete 180-degree change from 2000, when award-winning Korean actor Hong Seok-cheon publicly came out, facing immediate public backlash and shunning. Fired from his television programs, dropped by advertising deals, and forced into hiding due to stigmas of the time, Hong eventually made his way back into the industry to become an in-demand variety star and one of the few models of LGBTQ+ entertainers in South Korea. He was also one of the first people to publicly congratulate Bain on his coming out. K-pop's first LGBTQ+ boy band, LIONESSES, and solo singer AleXa also sent their congrats.

	With his bandmates at his side, Bain spoke to Billboard about the historic night, as did JUSTB's Lim Jimin, Geonu, Siwoo and Sangwoo (sixth member DY was recovering from an appendicitis surgery but did share some comments when he was feeling better through a representative). During the nighttime video call, it was evident that Bain is surrounded by a team that is not only enthusiastic about working with him but strives to understand him and make him know that he is truly accepted, regardless of who he loves.

For someone who's a part of the LGBTQ+ community, you can feel very alone, and it's so much better when you have support and people who love you. Bain has shared how it felt like he could breathe again, but as a group, did you feel a collective weight lifted that night?


 Geonu: I would like to say it was a “Day of Courage.” It was a day of breaking the new dawn for him and also for our team — it was such a day of legends.


Bain: Going on stage, no one said anything in particular; everyone treated me just as they always do. But I could feel it even without words, like, “Just be yourself,” “You can do it” — it was so powerful. So, I felt calm and steady as I stepped on stage. The air, the look, the feeling I had in that moment, I don't think I'll ever forget it.


Lim Jimin: I was actually taking a video of Bain backstage and I've seen his shows and stages, but “This is the moment,” [I thought]. I was speechless, you know?


DY: To be honest, I didn't feel particularly surprised. We've always known what kind of person Bain is on the inside, but watching him come out on stage did make me think, “How can we turn all those cheers into even greater support for JUSTB's performance and music?” It made me reflect and I actually felt a bit of nervousness as a result, too.


When talking to fans later, I loved how you all shared that you were proud of Bain; it's really special to see the whole team supporting you and even your company, Bluedot Entertainment. Is it rare to find such support in the industry?












Bain: Actually, it is kind of really rare. Our company and my team members were really supportive of me. I came out to my mom three years ago and then to my members and the company about two years ago. It's been good, and I'm grateful for that. But before that, no one knew. I was really scared that it would hurt my career. That fear was always there. So, after debut, I struggled with my sexual identity, feeling like I was just deceiving everyone, and it was a really tough time. But eventually, I realized I couldn't keep pretending. I shared my truth and everyone accepted me sincerely. I'm grateful for that, and now I describe it as if my heart beats so much louder.


What was the importance of having these open and honest conversations in the group?


Geonu: I try to understand people. I think the word understand is a really, really serious and deep word. It's almost impossible to 100% understand another human being, but I always try to understand people and I like that. With Bain, he's one of the closest people in my life right now. He's one of our members, so I wanted to understand him.


Bain: Geonu was the first person of my members that I opened up to about my identity. At the time, I was carrying so much on my own. I didn't know how to say it — or if I even should — but I needed someone to hear me. And he listened without judgment, just quietly accepted me, and that moment felt like a small light in the dark room.


 Does anyone have LGBTQ+ family members or other friends that have come out to you as well?


Siwoo: I don't personally, but I've known Bain for nine years, and when he came out, I didn't even think differently because I knew him very well.

	











Geonu: I actually have an LGBTQ friend, but regardless of that, I just wanted to understand and try to understand as a person. I think that's what the world needs right now.


Jimin: JUSTB is like my family. I do not have to understand him entirely; I just accept him as he is. During the performance, right after he sang on the stage, I started crying.


Geonu: I think that's the best answer; he's got the better answer! [Laughs] Because it's not even about understanding, it is just accepting.


DY: Bain is actually the first person in my life, but honestly, I've always admired his beautiful voice regardless of his sexual identity, so it never really mattered to me.


Speaking of performances, Bain performed Lady Gaga's “Born This Way” after his announcement, and on this tour, he also sang “Judas” and songs by Destiny's Child, Britney Spears, and the Pussycat Dolls. Do you feel a connection to these female artists?


Bain: I've always felt a deep connection to strong female artists. Growing up, singers like Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, Destiny's Child, and even Hwasa really gave me strength. Their music spoke about confidence, pain, and freedom —things I was trying to understand within myself. So, when I was struggling with my identity, their songs made me feel seen, even if they didn't know if I existed. Watching them on stage so unapologetically gave me courage. Performing their songs wasn't just about paying tribute. It was my way of saying thank you.


What are the current experiences for young people who wanna be involved in K-pop but may also be LGBTQ+ or questioning? Is the music industry more open-minded? Do you see others struggling?












Geonu: That's a good question. I want to say that the world is rapidly changing, it really is, day by day. It's so fast that we sometimes can't even catch up with the new trends or what's occurring. I'd like to tell our young generation not to be afraid of having more self-confidence and making moves. If you think it's right, then it's right. Just do your thing, say it out loud, and make the moves that you think are right.


Jimin: Also, showing yourselves is almost like art to us. I think it's very important to not be ashamed of your other sides. Showing up as what you are is most important.


Bain: Also, for young LGBTQ+ people who want to be in K-pop, there are still challenges, and I felt them too because it can be scary and there aren't many people to look up to. But every time someone shares their story, it helps others feel less alone. I hope anyone with this dream knows they don't have to hide who they are, and I hope the industry continues to move toward a place where people can simply be themselves. And just generally speaking, I do have some fellow artist friends who actually don't talk about their sexuality, so I don't know about them, but I just hope they can feel free to talk about it to me. If my experience can help even a little, I'm always open to listening. So, welcome!


That's a great attitude, especially since these situations can often appear negative. But Bain looked so cool on stage, wearing his sunglasses and big jacket; everyone was happy and cheering. Did being in Hollywood or Los Angeles inspire you in any way?


Bain: If there was any reason, it was just that I wanted to share my true story with our fans. But there was no reason I came out in LA. I was on tour, I received a lot of support from my fans and since LA was our last stop on the North American tour, it just naturally came out of me… it was kind of half spontaneous and half prepared, a bit. Because I was thinking about it and feeling like I was gaining courage and energy. So, I decided to show up as myself and say my truth.

	











Have others reached out to you? I saw that Hong Seok-cheon shared his congrats in an interview. Have you been able to talk with him?


Bain: Yes, after I saw Hong Seok-cheon article, I actually reached out to him personally with a DM. He is someone I looked up to for a long time because when he came out in Korea especially, it took so much courage. So, his words mean a lot to me. I hope to carry that same courage forward and be someone others can also look to, just like I've looked to him.


You wrapped JUSTB's JUST ODD World Tour, and even that name feels like a commitment to embracing identity. You all were heavily involved in creating your March EP, JUST ODD. What did you want to say at this moment, and can you express yourselves freely in the K-pop world?


Jimin: First of all, isn't “Just Odd” about, like, being just odd? It is not an odd thing and I love that.


Geonu: And regardless of other groups, we have had a pretty long journey in this industry and we've learned a lot. We felt that it's the right time to make the music from our own ideas, stories and gut feelings. So, we are making our new music and writing songs like this. And I think people are starting to accept that being different is not something to hide; it's something to celebrate. So, I guess the K-pop industry is changing, slowly but surely. It's still not easy, but I do feel like there's more space to be more open?


Sangwoo: “Bullet” has a message for everyone in the world. It's not about the chaos and the issues; it's about wanting a more peaceful world. So, I wrote parts of the first and second verses. I wanted the second one to express what I'm feeling more naturally and add more of my emotions to that verse.

	











Geonu: Charli xcx inspired “CHEST.” She's the one who brought that vibe and hyperpop to the mainstream. So, after all that, “CHEST” came out being inspired in that way.


DY: Working on the JUST ODD album was a meaningful chapter for me. It allowed me to see music from a new perspective. I didn't want to just make K-pop songs that focus on pretty visuals and performance — I wanted to create songs that tell a story. I'm proud that we were able to express that through this album. Moving forward, I want JUST B to continue breaking boundaries, not only musically but also emotionally and spiritually. I believe that in a world where “fakes” pretend to be real, good music must begin with truth. No matter how chaotic the world becomes, we're determined to protect that truth. And as for me, I don't just want to be a singer. I want to be a voice that shares real stories with people through both words and melody.


 Do you guys have upcoming plans for new music?


Geonu: Well, we had a bunch of really exciting schedules in Monterrey. We met our ONLY B here, so we were focusing on that. But we are planning for the second half of 2025; with all the events, more shows and music. We also really want to release a new album.


Jimin: For the next album, we want to show even more growth from the parts of us that made JUST ODD. We have to work super hard to make an even better album.


I think the only thing left to touch on is if you have an updated ideal type now, Bain?


Bain: [Group laughs] Well, it's very typical to say, but a funny person, someone who I can have good interactions with, that's very typical…but I will let you know, I like tall people. [Laughs]












And any final words to fans?


Geonu: So, to all the ONLY B's in the world, and even those who are not an ONLY B yet, we are making moves — true, honest moves. We are working hard on our true stories, refining our new branding, and sharing our true, authentic values. So, please stick together with us through this. You won't regret it.

And a second hit soundtrack, F1: The Movie, is coming right behind it. 


													By
												

	Paul Grein



	The drought is officially over.


	By entering the Billboard 200 at No. 8, KPop Demon Hunters becomes the highest-charting soundtrack since Wicked ranked No. 8 on the chart dated Jan. 25, on its way down from its No. 2 peak.


	This ends a nine-week stretch in which there wasn't a single soundtrack in the top half of Billboard's flagship albums chart. Things were particularly bleak the last two weeks, when the highest-charting soundtrack (Twisters: The Album) was way down at No. 175. That album had debuted and peaked at No. 7 in August 2024, but was leading Billboard's Top Soundtracks chart in recent weeks largely because there was no fresh competition.


	There is now. The KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack was released through Republic Records on June 20, the same day the film premiered on Netflix. The album was preceded by Twice‘s version of “Takedown” as the lead single.

	











KPop Demon Hunters is the highest-charting soundtrack from an animated film since Metro Boomin's Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse ranked No. 7 on the Billboard 200 dated July 1, 2023, on its way down from its No. 5 peak.




			Trending on Billboard		







Billboard's Keith Caulfield reports that it's the first soundtrack from a Netflix program to reach No. 1 on Top Soundtracks in more than two years — since Stranger Things: Soundtrack from the Netflix Series, Season 4, re-entered atop the list dated Nov. 19, 2022.


	And when it rains, it pours: Another hot soundtrack, F1: The Album, was released on June 27 and is expected to debut high on next week's Billboard 200. Five singles have been released from the album – Don Toliver's “Lose My Mind” (featuring Doja Cat), Rosé's “Messy,” Myke Towers' “Baja California,” Tate McRae's “Just Keep Watching” and Ed Sheeran's “Drive.”

	











	If both KPop Demon Hunters and F1: The Album appear in the top 10 on next week's Billboard 200, it will mark the first time that two soundtracks have appeared in the top 10 simultaneously since the chart dated Jan. 8, 2022, when Encanto ranked No. 7 and the Vince Guaraldi Trio's legendary soundtrack from 1965's A Charlie Brown Christmas ranked No. 8.


F1: The Movie was the weekend's top-grossing film in the U.S. and Canada, with an estimated gross of $55.6 million, according to boxofficemojo.com. It bumped How to Train Your Dragon, the boxoffice leader the two previous weekends, down to No. 2.


	Here's the full tracklist from KPop Demon Hunters:


	“TAKEDOWN” – Twice (Jeongyeon, Jihyo, Chaeyoung)


	“How It's Done” – HUNTR/X (EJAE, Audrey Nuna, and REI AMI)


	“Soda Pop” – Saja Boys (Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo, and samUIL Lee)


	“Golden” – HUNTR/X (EJAE, Audrey Nuna, and REI AMI)


	“Strategy” – Twice


	“TAKEDOWN” – HUNTR/X (EJAE, Audrey Nuna, and REI AMI)


	“Your Idol” – Saja Boys (Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo, and samUIL Lee)


	“Free” – Rumi and Jinu (EJAE and Andrew Choi)


	“What It Sounds Like” – HUNTR/X (EJAE, Audrey Nuna, and REI AMI)


	“Love Maybe” – MeloMance


	“Path” – Jokers

The group will return next year with new music and a world tour.

	Hannah Dailey



	The boys are back. In a Weverse livestream Tuesday (July 1), all seven members of BTS reunited for the first time since completing all of their military service requirements and shared plans for their future.


	Squeezing in together on a cozy-looking couch, RM, Jin, SUGA, j-hope, Jimin, V and Jung Kook smiled while greeting ARMY as a unified group for the first time in years. Laughing and joking with each other, they shared in a group statement, “We'll be releasing a new BTS album in the spring of next year.”

	











	“Starting in July, all seven of us will begin working closely together on new music,” they continued. “Since it will be a group album, it will reflect each member's thoughts and ideas. We're approaching the album with the same mindset we had when we first started.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The performers also announced plans to hit the road again in 2026. “We're also planning a world tour alongside the new album,” they said. “We'll be visiting fans all around the world, so we hope you're as excited as we are.”


	ARMY has been waiting for this moment since Jin became the first of the Bangtan Boys to enlist in the South Korean military in December 2022. Over the next two-plus years, the remaining members gradually completed their own service periods, with RM, Suga, V, Jimin and Jung Kook becoming the final groupmates to be discharged in June. 

	











	Leading up to their long-anticipated reunion, BTS has been teasing plans to make a comeback as soon as possible. In April, j-hope told Apple Music 1's Zane Lowe that he anticipated the band's next steps to have “massive energy,” while Jin told Jimmy Fallon in May, “It was great to be alone, but when they come back [from the military], since they worked very hard, I'm going to honor them and give them great respect.”


	Now that the band has officially confirmed when they'll return with new music and shows, fans will be counting down to spring 2026 to see what the septet has in store. BTS last dropped an album in 2020, with Be reaching No. 1 on the Billboard 200, spawning Billboard Hot 100-toppers “Dynamite” and “Life Goes On.”

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


Apple TV+ has greenlighted I'm Glad My Mom Died, a dramedy inspired by Jennette McCurdy's bestselling memoir of the same name with Jennifer Aniston set to star and executive produce.


	The casting inevitably brings up questions about the future of Aniston's popular Apple TV+ drama series The Morning Show, which she also stars in and executive produces. The Morning Show is currently picked up through Season 4, which is set to premiere Sept. 17. Aniston's involvement in I'm Glad My Mom Died will not impact her ability to continue to star alongside Reese Witherspoon should The Morning Show get a fifth season — which I hear is fully expected.

	Hailing from Apple Studios, the 10-episode I'm Glad My Mom Died is written, executive produced, and showrun by child actor-turned-writer McCurdy and Ari Katcher (Ramy, Jerrod Carmichael Reality Show).




			Watch on Deadline		







	In addition to Aniston, McCurdy and Katcher, the series' executive producers/production entities include Sharon Horgan's Merman, which is behind Apple TV+'s Bad Sisters, LuckyChap, Jerrod Carmichael and Erica Kay.


I'm Glad My Mom Died is a heartbreaking and funny recounting of Jennette McCurdy's struggles as a former child actor while dealing with her overbearing, domineering mother. The dramedy will center on the codependent relationship between an 18-year-old actress in a hit kid's show, and her narcissistic mother (Aniston) who relishes in her identity as “a starlet's mother.”


	McCurdy rose to fame with her role as Sam Puckett on the Nickelodeon sitcom iCarly, which she reprised on the spinoff series Sam & Cat. 


	The full list of I'm Glad My Mom Died‘s executive producers include McCurdy, Katcher, Aniston via Echo Films; Horgan and Stacy Greenberg for Merman, Dani Gorin, Tom Ackerley and Josey McNamara for LuckyChap; Carmichael and Kay.


	Published on August 9, 2022 by Simon & Shuster, McCurdy's memoir I'm Glad My Mom Died reached more than 80 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list. She is repped by CAA and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller. Aniston is repped by CAA, Lighthouse Management & Media, and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller. Horgan is repped by United Agents in the UK and WME in the US, and Nelson Davis. LuckyChap is repped by Entertainment 360, CAA and attorney Jeff Bernstein. Katcher is repped by WME, Entertainment 360, and Ziffren Brittenham. Carmichael is repped by WME, Entertainment 360, and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole.

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: David Dastmalchian (The Life of Chuck) has landed the role of big bad M. Bison in Legendary‘s live-action Street Fighter movie, based on the video games from Capcom, sources tell Deadline.


	Reps for Legendary declined to comment. It's the biggest role to date for the actor, who's now been working consistently for nearly 20 years, and marks another big leap forward, following his strong marks earned for starring in the buzzy horror film Late Night with the Devil.


	Plot details for Street Fighter remain under wraps. M. Bison is the central villain of many of the games — the leader of the criminal organization known as Shadaloo, which is involved in various illegal activities, including arms trafficking, mind control experiments, and global domination. His ultimate goal? World domination.

	











	As previously announced, others in the cast of Street Fighter include Andrew Koji, Noah Centineo, Jason Momoa, Roman Reigns, Orville Peck, Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson, and Andrew Schulz. Bad Trip‘s Kitao Sakurai is directing.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Launched in 1987, Street Fighter is a series of fighting games revolving around intense one-on-one battles between a diverse cast of martial artists, organized by M. Bison as a global fighting tournament. The games have sold over 55 million units worldwide since launch, making the franchise one of the most well-known and highest-grossing of all time.


	Recently seen in Mike Flanagan's Stephen King adaptation The Life of Chuck, which won the coveted People's Choice Award at TIFF and went on to distribution via Neon, Dastmalchian was also seen starring earlier this year alongside Alexander Skarsgård in Apple's comedic sci-fi thriller series Murderbot. No stranger to villain turns, he'll soon be seen in Dexter: Resurrection and Season 2 of Netflix's hit series One Piece, where he plays the evil Mr. 3. 

	











	Currently in production opposite Kelly Marie Tran on the psychological thriller Kodak SuperXX, with Bryan Fuller's Dust Bunny among his other upcoming projects, Dastmalchian is repped by Atlas Artists and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	In a competitive situation with multiple bidders, Hulu has nabbed for series development Best Offer Wins, the debut novel by former Washington Post journalist Marisa Kashino. Greta Lee (Past Lives) is expected to star in the drama adaptation, which will be written by Suzanne Heathcote (Killing Eve), with the two executive producing alongside Kashino as well as Chelsea McKinnies and Mackenzie Roussos from Entertainment 360. Hulu sibling 20th Television is the studio.


	Described as a sharp exploration of class, ambition, and the modern housing crisis, the Best Offer Wins book centers on Margo, a 37-year-old publicist who, after a year and a half of failed bids in her house hunting, becomes obsessed with a perfect off-market house, resorting to stalking, transposing and scheming to land the home she believes would save her marriage.

Political Editor


	The feud between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk is back on.


	After Musk has railed against Trump's Big, Beautiful Bill in recent days, as GOP leaders struggle to get it across the finish line, the president took the opportunity to lash out at him.


	On Tuesday, the Daily Mail's Emily Goodin asked Trump if he would deport Musk, and the president responded, “I don't know. We'll have to take a look. We may have to put DOGE on Elon. You know what DOGE is? DOGE is the monster that might have to go back and eat Elon. Wouldn't that be terrible?” 


	The Department of Government Efficiency is the effort to slash the size of the federal government that was led by Musk until late May. That was followed days later by a very public falling out between Musk and Trump, with the billionaire accusing the president of being linked to Jeffrey Epstein. Trump again said that Musk was upset that the legislation terminates the electric vehicle mandate, something that benefits his company Tesla.

RELATED: ‘Squid Game' Creator Compares Show's Villains To Elon Musk: “Musk Is Everywhere These Days”


	Earlier, on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “Elon Musk knew, long before he so strongly Endorsed me for President, that I was strongly against the EV Mandate. It is ridiculous, and was always a major part of my campaign. Electric cars are fine, but not everyone should be forced to own one. Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE. Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!”

	











	Musk and Trump had a detente in recent weeks, but the tensions flared back up as the Tesla CEO again went after the Big, Beautiful Bill, saying that it would force the U.S. into “debt slavery.” He has also revived his idea of creating a third party, and warned of the legislation's rollback of clean energy initiatives. Musk wrote on Sunday, “A massive strategic error is being made right now to damage solar/battery that will leave America extremely vulnerable in the future.”


	Musk also has vowed to back challengers to lawmakers who vote for the legislation.


	“Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame! And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.”

Well was the 200 million worth it Elon?

They should both self deport.

So roll out the asylum red carpet for poor old discrimated rich white colonist Afrikaners. But deport richest white Afrikan American for having a free speech tantrum. Corrupt kleptocrat reality tv clown show hypocrisy bias = full marks here.

Trump is for sale. And he's trying to sell himself to a rich man.

Barron Trump was born in March 2006.  Melania Trump became a US Citizen in July of 2006.  Anchors away!

Don't forget Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Ramaswamy, etc. They don't even stand up for the Hispanics being deported. No good people.

					By Max Goldbart 

International TV Co-Editor


	The new £450M ($620M) studio backed by James Corden‘s Fulwell Entertainment has lost its main investor.


	Cain International, the investor behind Crown Works Studios in Sunderland, has pulled out, according to the BBC. The firm confirmed its decision to the BBC but declined to comment on the reason. The studio was initially positioned as a JV between Fulwell and Cain. 


	A Fulwell spokeswoman told Deadline the studio “remains committed to working with the council to find appropriate private funding, complementing the combined NE [North East England] authority and wider government funding needed to make these world-class production studios a reality.”

	Of the £450M, the UK government, which has repeatedly lauded the new studios in the north east of England, is providing £25M and the North East mayoral authority has committed to invest about £120m, according to the UK's Local Democracy Reporting Service. This leaves around £300M that will need to be sought in private investment now that Cain has dropped out. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Sunderland City Council said the proposals were “being presented to the investment market, with the aim to put in place a final funder and developer later this year”.


	The studio was given the go-ahead last year. Its backers say it will create 8,000 jobs and cover 1.6 million sq ft. When completed it is expected to generate £336m for the local economy every year, they say.


	The news comes amid changes in the bustling UK studio space scene amid what is a difficult market for movie and high-end TV production.


	Over the weekend, the five-year-old Longcross Studios, which Netflix uses to make shows like The Witcher, confirmed it will became a permanent space after it was given planning permission.


	Fulwell is fresh off the back of its merger with LeBron James' SpringHill Company, which recently raised $40M.

Despite solid reviews and a cute star, Pixar's Elio never stood a chance at the box office, where it cratered and gave Pixar its lowest opening weekend ever. The reviews got it right, though: The movie needed some seasoning. “In Turning Red and Luca, the characters' youthful friendships feel specific and lived-in,” Jesse Hassenger wrote in his review for The A.V. Club. “Fun as it is, Elio just goes for the montage, eager to speak a universal language.” According to a new report from The Hollywood Reporter, that was by design. Pixar's internal pearl-clutching over and self-censorship of the film's queer-coded, fashion-forward, and environmentally friendly lead character resulted in a movie that lacked substance. After last year's Win Or Lose debacle, it's an easy story to believe.

Elio's trouble began in 2023, when original director Adrian Molina (Coco) submitted a near-complete movie that alluded to Elio's queer identity and focused heavily on his passion for environmentalism. Molina, who is openly gay, never intended the film to be a coming-out story, sources say, but rather a reflection of the artist who made the movie. (So that's why they want to replace everything with AI!) The company line states that he was moved on to Coco 2. Others say it came after two screenings: one for test audiences, which revealed audiences liked the movie but wouldn't pay to see it, and another for Pete Docter, which ended with a conversation that “hurt” Molina deeply. He left the project shortly after and was replaced by Madeline Sharafian and Domee Shi. Star America Ferrera also exited and was replaced by Zoe Saldaña. For her part, Ferrera purportedly left because “there was no longer Latinx representation in the leadership,” and also due to the need to frequently re-record dialogue for a movie that was supposed to be finished two years ago.

Those working on the movie were also dismayed by the project's about-face. Speaking on the record, former Pixar assistant editor Sarah Ligatich told THR how “deeply saddened and aggrieved” she was by Pixar's changes to Elio. Ligatich, who provided notes on the film as part of PixPRIDE, Pixar's internal LGBTQ+ group, mentioned an “exodus of talent” that left the project after the movie was recut. Others were a little more blunt, saying that the version in theaters is “far worse” than Molina's original.

Ultimately, it is a confluence of problems at Disney. First, the company has devalued its Pixar movies by releasing them through Disney+, which guarantees a swift streaming release. Going to the movies as a family is expensive, and expecting people to show up so soon after Lilo & Stitch, when Elio will be available on Disney+ soon anyway, seems like a big and expensive ask. The other thing is Docter's emphasis on making the “most relatable films” possible, which has smoothed over any nuances or originality from recent Pixar movies. After Disney's “Don't Say Gay” fights and the homophobic outrage surrounding Lightyear, some presume that Pixar is erasing anything that could be construed as gay subtext from their movies before Disney even asks them to. Whether that's a company edict or not, it appears to be bearing out on screen.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","It's just another end of the world in 40 Acres","https://www.avclub.com/40-acres-review","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 16:01:11 GMT","

Even if you stopped watching The Walking Dead back in 2016, it probably doesn't feel like it. Director R. T. Thorne's post-apocalyptic debut 40 Acres is similar to everything else that's come in the wake of AMC's never-ending zombie franchise. It's fringe horror, only dipping its toes into its world's doomsday conditions. Thorne uses this world to explore the familial, preservation-first dynamics of survivors as seen in 28 Years Later, The Last Of Us, Lazareth, Didn't Die—all properties rattled off from recent memory. 40 Acres‘ paranoid storytelling just never finds a unique take on dystopia.

“It's been 14 years since a fungal pandemic decimated 98% of the animal biosphere,” the opening text crawl reads. “12 years since a second Civil War broke out as a result of global food chain collapse,” yadda yadda. An outbreak spreads unchallenged, and warfare has torn America apart—but audiences don't witness anything. 40 Acres is instead about “The Freemans,” a small group who protect their farmland with their lives. Danielle Deadwyler stars as Hailey Freeman, the matriarch of this little militia on the prairie. The rules are simple: Protect one another, kill any trespassers, and trust no one. At least, that's what Hailey insists.

40 Acres establishes an ominous aesthetic that has you waiting for a vile turn. Hailey lives by an NFL defensive lineman's code: “We must protect this house.” You know something terrible's eventually going to come knocking, yet Thorne and co-writer Glenn Taylor keep things drearily mundane. Locationally, 40 Acres feels related to A Quiet Place, Arcadian, and It Comes At Night—any isolated household that fears outside interference—but it doesn't have the excitable anxiety of its peers. Despite mentions of destructive fungi and home turf battlegrounds, 40 Acres fails to show off any extremes for its nearly two-hour runtime.

More important than the conditions, though, 40 Acres is about Hailey's interactions with those she holds dearest. Like so many other post-apocalyptic stories, Thorne tests the boundaries of togetherness as civilization breaks down. In a world where there's safety in numbers, Hailey refuses to let even allies past her electric fences, fearing treachery. Kataem O'Connor rebels as Emanuel “Manny” Freeman, who keeps his mother's closed-off instincts accountable. Hailey's wish to remain walled off conflicts with Manny's desire to meet cute girls at other camps (like Milcania Diaz-Rojas' Dawn) or to fortify their ranks with new friends. It's an age-old compound conundrum that's typically solved when the hardened introvert has no choice but to accept the help of others—unsurprisingly, something in-line with what happens here.

40 Acres doesn't want to be a horror movie, instead positioning Deadwyler as an action star. Hailey's enemies are human; she's proficient in gunfights and hand-to-hand combat. The same holds true for Michael Greyeyes, who stars as Galen, the patriarchal figure of the Freeman outpost. Thorne's experience as a music video director trickles down into cinematographer Jeremy Benning's frenetic fight scenes, where Deadwyler delivers justice without mercy. The film's third act morphs into a siege movie as Hailey and Galen stand their ground against an antagonistic squad of cannibals who've gnawed through neighboring farms—which is, finally, where the excitement has been hiding.

The problem is that 40 Acres simply sprinkles its few unique ideas atop a shambling post-apocalyptic template. There's chatter of Union soldiers called in as backup, but the “Civil War” tease is hardly utilized as social commentary. There's no leftover pandemic frights, merely a scarcity of resources. Thorne's script spends its time answering harder-hitting questions, like how or where a hormonal boy pleasures himself without Wi-Fi, or how many punches to the face should your children land while sparring before dinner? Sure, it's funny to see Galen chastise the youngsters for using sauce packets that are only still edible thanks to being full of processed garbage, but the barebones “humans are the real monsters” angle is worn out. Thorne is rehashing old end-of-days conversations with contemporary needledrops and bullets to the head, but it's not enough to distract from the monotonous inevitability that kneecaps the film's impact.

40 Acres just doesn't separate itself from a pack of post-apocalyptic survival scenarios that all hunt, gather, and defend like the rest. There are no monsters here beyond the maniacs who'd turn evil once there's no governance over morality. Deadwyler and company at least have their mettle tested in action, which finally gets your pulse going as bodies start hitting the floor. But the injection of dead baddies is too little and too late for this uninspired iteration on a familiar template.

Director: R. T. Thorne
Writers: R. T. Thorne, Glenn Taylor
Starring: Danielle Deadwyler, Kataem O'Connor, Michael Greyeyes, Milcania Diaz-Rojas, Leenah Robinson
Release Date: July 2, 2025

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Renate Reinsve rejects her famous actor father in Joachim Trier's Sentimental Value trailer","https://www.avclub.com/sentimental-value-trailer-joachim-trier","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 14:57:24 GMT","

Gustav may not be the worst person in the world, but to his daughter, he is. Renate Reinsve and Stellan Skarsgård lead Joachim Trier's latest affecting character study about a stage actress, Nora (Reinsve), who rejects a role in her famous actor father's (Skarsgård) comeback film. Will we ever be free from the shackles of the year of the nepo baby? 

Luckily, this doesn't seem like a project critics want any sort of distance from. Sentimental Value was a huge hit at Cannes, where it won the Grand Prix this spring. Now it has a trailer for the rest of us, which you can watch below:



The beginning of the trailer immediately establishes that once again, we're dealing with complicated people. “I can't work with him,” Nora tells Rachel Kemp (Elle Fanning), a young American actress who takes on the role Gustav had previously offered his daughter. “We can't really talk. My father is a very difficult person.”

The film's official synopsis reads as follows: “Sisters Nora (Reinsve) and Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas) reunite with their estranged father, the charismatic Gustav (Skarsgård), a once-renowned director who offers stage actress Nora a role in what he hopes will be his comeback film. When Nora turns it down, she soon discovers he has given her part to an eager young Hollywood star (Fanning). Suddenly, the two sisters must navigate their complicated relationship with their father — and deal with an American star dropped right into the middle of their complex family dynamics.”

Nora may not have wanted to work with her dad, but Reinsve was clearly game to reunite with Trier, whom she previously worked with on the very-much-not-the-worst The Worst Person In The World. Sentimental Value also reunites Trier with Worst Person co-screenwriter, Eskil Vogt.

“We had this feeling that if we thought too much about the pressure of following that one up, we'd be hindered from reaching in and getting more emotional,” Trier told Vanity Fair of the pressure associated with this feature in May. Luckily, it seems like they didn't struggle all that much in that department. Grab a box of tissues and head to theaters for Sentimental Value, premiering November 7.

Rick Hurst, best known for his role as Deputy Cletus Hogg on the classic CBS series “The Dukes of Hazzard,” has passed away at the age of 79. As reported by TMZ, the actor's passing was initially confirmed by his ex-wife, Candace Kaniecki. 

While the cause of death has not been publicly disclosed, tributes to the late actor have flooded social media from fans, former co-stars, and entertainment peers.

A post shared by The Dukes of Hazzard (@thedukesofhazzard_)

Among those remembering Hurst is Ben Jones, who portrayed mechanic Cooter Davenport on the series. Jones, 83, shared a deeply personal message on Facebook, honoring his longtime friend and co-star.

“It doesn't seem right that Rick Hurst passed away this afternoon. When something so unexpected happens, it is ‘harder to process', as the current expression goes,” Jones wrote. “I have known Rick for over 45 years and there wasn't a minute of that time that he didn't leave me smiling or laughing. Sure he was a professional comedian, but mostly he just had a heart as big as Texas.”

Jones continued, highlighting Hurst's professional achievements and kind spirit. “He was a fine actor, a splendid comic, and a wonderfully supportive colleague,” he said. “I don't know about y'all but I believe in an afterlife, and I can see Rick up there in Heaven with [deceased Dukes of Hazzard cast members] Jimmy Best and Sorrell Booke and Denver Pyle, putting on the funniest show inside those Pearly Gates.”

Fans across various “Dukes of Hazzard” fan pages echoed Jones' sentiments, sharing memories of Hurst's warmth, humor, and dedication to his supporters.

“To fans, he was more than a character—he was family,” one fan page posted on Instagram. “Rick's passing is a profound loss, but his memory will forever ride shotgun in the hearts of those who grew up watching him, laughing with him, and loving him. Rest easy, Rick. You made the world a little lighter.”

Hurst joined the cast of “The Dukes of Hazzard” during its second season and remained a memorable part of the show's Southern charm and slapstick humor. Though decades have passed since the series aired its final episode, the bonds formed on and off screen remain as strong as ever, evident in the outpouring of love following Hurst's passing.

As fans continue to celebrate his contributions, both comedic and personal, Hurst is remembered not just as Deputy Cletus Hogg, but as a beloved friend, actor, and light in the lives of many.

Eva Longoria's absence from Lauren Sánchez and Jeff Bezos' lavish $50 million wedding in Venice quickly sparked speculation — especially considering her longtime friendship with the bride. But according to reports, the “Desperate Housewives” alum had good reason for missing the star-studded ceremony.

Per Page Six, Longoria was in Spain filming the latest season of her CNN travel series, “Eva Longoria: Searching for Spain”, during the three-day celebration. She was also supporting her husband, José Bastón, who recently underwent shoulder surgery.

The couple was photographed relaxing on the beach in Marbella that same weekend, with Longoria adjusting Bastón's sling before sharing a kiss — a moment that quickly made headlines. Though the timing led some to question whether there was a rift between Longoria and Sánchez, sources confirmed there is no tension between the two women.

In fact, Longoria was one of the celebrity guests at Sánchez's bachelorette party in Paris just weeks before the wedding. She appeared in photos alongside Kim Kardashian, Katy Perry and Kris Jenner, and even shared a moment holding hands with Sánchez during the celebration. While speaking to People at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, Longoria admitted she could only pop into the Paris festivities briefly but said, “It's just the best feeling in the world to be there and go, ‘Yay, love'.”

A post shared by Eva Longoria Baston (@evalongoria)

While the wedding weekend played out in Venice, Longoria was making waves of her own in Spain. She was spotted in Marbella wearing a bright pink bikini and straw hat during a family beach outing. According to TMZ, the actress was enjoying some downtime between filming commitments for her CNN series, which is now in its third season.

Days later, she posted a carousel of photos on Instagram wearing a sunny yellow halter mini dress while posing barefoot in her garden. She captioned the post with a series of emojis: “🍋🌱🌼💚”. The outfit continued her streak of bright, effortless summer looks and added to the conversation about her whereabouts during the Bezos-Sánchez wedding.

Despite online chatter, Longoria and Sánchez's relationship remains as strong as ever. The pair have been close for more than two decades, bonded by shared values and a passion for philanthropy. In 2024, The Hollywood Reporter featured a conversation between the two women, where they opened up about their friendship and long-standing commitment to giving back.

Sánchez, vice chair of the Bezos Earth Fund, awarded Longoria the $50 million Bezos Courage and Civility Award to support the Eva Longoria Foundation, which provides educational and economic opportunities for Latina women and girls. “You and I constantly have these conversations that inspire each other,” Longoria said during their chat.

A father heroically jumped into the sea to save his child after an accident on the Disney Dream cruise boat ended with his daughter falling overboard into the ocean. The stunning incident happened on June 29 as the boat was returning to Ft. Lauderdale from an island excursion, according to a People report.

A TikTok user named @noeayala32 shared video footage in which the pair can be seen bobbing in the water before being pulled onto the small craft that came after them.

CBS News showed video footage of the aftermath in which a small rescue boat retrieves the wayward passengers, and described explained what occurred.

The report explained that a tot fell overboard, and was followed into the sea by her father who jumped in to save her. The station's Christian Benavides called the cause of the child's tumble from the ship's fourth deck “really quite a mystery.” 

He also revealed that the recreational area from which the child fell is outfitted with plexiglass that is “supposed to protect people from going overboard,” and that the logistics of the fall are particularly perplexing considering the girl's short stature.

Benavides continued his report to say the two passengers were stuck treading water in the “open ocean” for TWENTY MINUTES before a rescue boat could reach them.

The identities of the girl who fell off the ship and her father have not been publicly identified as of publishing on June 30.

People revealed in a report published the day after the accident that they obtained a statement from a passenger who witnessed the child fall overboard the Disney Dream.

The outlet says the passenger recalled hearing an “awful scream” she assumes came from the child's mother before hearing a splash in the water below. The witness compared the loud noise created by the fall to the sound of “hitting pavement.” She said a “man overboard” alert was then called out over the boat's loudspeakers, and flotation devices were thrown into the water towards the overboard vacationers.

The story says the source expressed surprise that the passengers were found, and that Disney Cruise Line provided a statement to the magazine which read, “We are committed to the safety and well-being of our guests, and this incident highlights the effectiveness of our safety protocols.”

CBS spoke to another passenger, who the said the ship was moving so quickly that those onboard quickly “lost sight” of the people in the water.

Sorry, grilled cheese fans — Nate Cooper won't be making a comeback.  As fans celebrate the official news of ‘Devil Wears Prada 2‘, Adrian Grenier won't reprise his role as Nate. 

According to Entertainment Weekly, Adrian Grenier, who portrayed Nate — Andy Sachs' complicated and often-criticized boyfriend (Yes, Internet isn't a big fan!) in The Devil Wears Prada — won't be stepping back into the role for the sequel. Fans often label him a “red flag.”

According to Entertainment Weekly, two sources familiar with the production revealed his absence as filming began.

Production on the long-anticipated sequel is now underway, set to continue through summer. 20th Century Studios confirmed the news on Monday. Director David Frankel and writer Aline Brosh McKenna have also returned, bringing back the creative force behind the original.

Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, and Stanley Tucci are all confirmed to return, reuniting the fan-favorite cast nearly two decades after the original's release.

A post shared by 20th Century Studios (@20thcenturystudios)

To jog your memory, in the 2006 film, Andy Sachs (Hathaway) undertakes a whirlwind journey through New York's elite fashion world under the tutelage of Miranda Priestly (Streep). 

Along the way, her boyfriend Nate became a point of fan frustration, with many labeling him the “true villain” of the story for failing to support Andy's career.

In a 2021 oral history with EW, Grenier reflected on that backlash: 

“It hadn't occurred to me until I started to really think about it, and perhaps it was because I was as immature as Nate was at the time.”

He continued, “At the end of the day, it's just a birthday, right? It's not the end of the world. I've come to realize the truth in that perspective.”

Director Frankel once admitted there were tentative talks of a follow-up years ago. In the same interview with EW, he said: “[The studio] didn't ask for [a sequel]. We had a meeting where we said, ‘What could we do if there was a sequel?' Maybe it was stupid; we felt like, no, this story has been told.”

Still, author Lauren Weisberger's follow-up book sparked renewed interest.

Plot details are under wraps, but multiple reports previously hinted that the sequel would follow Miranda Priestly navigating a struggling publishing world.

At the same time, Blunt's character has risen to power at a fashion conglomerate that Runway needs as an advertiser.

‘The Devil Wears Prada 2‘ is expected to hit theaters in 2026, bringing fans back into the world of Runway nearly 20 years after the original made cinematic history.

Meanwhile, if you'd like to refresh your memory on the film, you can start streaming it here.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","VIDEO: Ryan Gosling Looks Quite Different in New Movie","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/ryan-gosling-stunning-transformation-new-trailer/","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 03:52:27 GMT","

For years now, Ryan Gosling has been charming audiences with not only his great acting abilities, but also his amazingly devilish good looks. While best known for his roles in movies like “The Notebook” and “Barbie,” the Oscar-nominated actor has transformed into his latest role, which shows him in a whole new light.

Gosling is set to star in his newest film, “Project Hail Mary,” and the trailer has left fans excited to see the movie when it hits theaters.

As the trailer begins, we see Gosling in character, which includes a bushy beard and long hair. The unkempt look is a contrast to how the normally clean-shaven, put-together A-list actor usually looks.

The movie is an adaptation of the Andy Weir novel with the same name. That novel was released in May 2021. The Hollywood Reporter states the movie hails from Amazon MGM Studios and will be released on March 20, 2026.

For the movie, Gosling plays Ryland Grace, who happens to be a middle school teacher challenged with the difficult task of having to save the planet Earth.

As seen in the trailer, Grace ends up on a spaceship. However, he is confused on why he is there and doesn't seem to have any recollection of his past.

While Grace tries to get out of being tasked with this huge responsibility, he soon discovers that he doesn't have a choice in the matter. In addition to Gosling, the movie also stars Sandra Huller and Milana Vayntrub.

A post shared by Project Hail Mary (@projecthailmary)

The trailer for “Project Hail Mary” debuted and fans have flocked to the comments to show their appreciation for the new look for Gosling and the fact that he is starring in a sci-fi movie.

One person commented on YouTube: “I have rarely been this excited to see a movie. Jazz hands forever!”

Another fan wrote: “This book was fantastic, Gosling is going to be awesome in the lead role.  Here's to 9 months of waiting!”

Many fans had thoughts on Rocky also: “Rocky's ship design is very interesting – definitely more extra-terrestrial than the book,” and “I REALLY wish they hadn't of spoiled Rocky, but I totally understand why they had to. Hard to get butts in seats.”

One final commenter was impressed all the way around: “So glad they're sticking to the book! Gosling seems to be perfect for the role, and the storyline looks to be hitting the right marks. Amaze!”

Glen Powell is flexing his action star skills in Edgar Wright‘s long-awaited “The Running Man.” Powell leads the film as one of the many American citizens who participate in a game show called “The Running Man,” in which murderous Hunters chase contestants across the globe. Colman Domingo plays the host of the reality show, with Wright reuniting with his “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World” alum Michael Cera as well for the ensemble cast.

“The Running Man” is based on Stephen King‘s 1982 novel, which was published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. Wright co-wrote the adaptation with “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World” screenwriter Michael Bacall; Wright previously announced that the film will be more faithful to the source material than Paul Michael Glaser's 1987 film version starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. Both the novel and the film were set in the year 2025, with Wright's iteration now to be released this year.

Josh Brolin, Lee Pace, Katy O'Brian, William H. Macy, Emilia Jones, David Zayas, and Sean Hayes also star. 

 










Wright said during an appearance on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast in December 2023 that he felt as though the novel really had to get its due onscreen. “I like the film but I like the book more, and they didn't really adapt the book. Even as a teenager when I saw the Schwarzenegger film I was like, ‘Oh, this isn't like the book at all!,'” Wright said. “And I think, ‘Nobody's done that book.'”

Lead star Powell teased while at CinemaCon 2025 that “The Running Man” was one of his most intense roles ever, saying, “I've never worked harder on a movie in my life.” Powell also told IndieWire that it was “surreal” to work on the blockbuster, especially filming at Wembley Stadium. 

“Oh, we're shooting a pretty crazy sequence in ‘Running Man,'” he said. “We've been taking over Wembley for the week. That was literally my office. One of the boxes in Wembley is literally my holding area, that was my hair and makeup [spot]. We had an action sequence within the building that we were doing. It was a pretty surreal way to spend the day.”

Paramount Pictures will release “The Running Man” in theaters on Friday, November 7. Check out the trailer below.

It's been three years since Joachim Trier's “The Worst Person in the World” introduced the world to Renate Reinsve with her breakout performance. Add in her 2024 English language debut with “A Different Man” and a slew of other critically acclaimed projects, and it's obvious that Reinsve's rise is only getting started. 

And, at least according to IndieWire's own Anne Thompson, Reinsve is predicted to be an Oscar contender yet again with her upcoming Trier reunion, “Sentimental Value.”

Trier wrote “Sentimental Value” with his “The Worst Person in the World” scribe Eskil Vogt. Reinsve is back in the lead role, this time playing an actress (she previously spoofed the industry in “A Different Man” as a director and playwright) whose fraught relationship with her famous auteur father (Stellan Skarsgård) is put to the test after the death of her mother. 

 








Related Stories ‘Cloud' Trailer: ‘Cure' Director Kiyoshi Kurosawa Again Proves He's a Master — This Time with a Grand Shootout Brian Cox Decided to Become a Character Actor After  Visiting Hollywood: ‘It Really Gave Me the Creeps' 

The official synopsis reads: “Sisters Nora (Reinsve) and Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas) reunite with their estranged father, the charismatic Gustav (Skarsgård), a once-renowned director who offers stage actress Nora a role in what he hopes will be his comeback film. When Nora turns it down, she soon discovers he has given her part to an eager young Hollywood star (Elle Fanning). Suddenly, the two sisters must navigate their complicated relationship with their father — and deal with an American star dropped right into the middle of their complex family dynamics.” 

 










“Sentimental Value” won the Cannes Grand Prix. The IndieWire review applauded the layered writing of the feature, with Skarsgård's director character Gustav Borg literally “directing his daughter on how to forgive him in the wake of his ex-wife's death.” Gustav does not apologize for leaving their family when Reinsve's Nora was just a child, but instead, he believes he can be absolved by casting her in an autobiographical Netflix drama about his own life. 

As our David Ehrlich wrote, “Mercy is not quite the same thing as forgiveness. Mercy asks for allowance, where forgiveness demands absolution. Mercy is a means, and forgiveness its ultimate end. Forgiveness is an act, while mercy is a performance. The distinction between the two may be subtle, but through the extraordinary grace of Trier's filmmaking, which here revels in the transmutational power of filmmaking itself, ‘Sentimental Value' renders it larger than life.”

Ehrlich further praised Reinsve's performance, writing that the actress is “immaculately attuned to Trier's energy” with the film being “carried by the manic frustration she brings to her part, which is as fun as it is freighted with crisis.” Meanwhile, Fanning gives an “extraordinary, needle-threading performance that requires her to be perfectly cast as someone who's wrong for her role.” 

 










“Sentimental Value” was first announced in 2023 shortly after “The Worst Person in the World” was nominated for Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature at the 94th Academy Awards. “The Worst Person in the World” completed Trier's Oslo Trilogy, which began with 2006's “Reprise” and was followed in 2011 by “Oslo, August 31st.”

Neon will release “Sentimental Value” in select theaters November 7. Check out the trailer below.

5.5

Genre:

Pop/R&B

Label:

HYBE / Geffen

Reviewed:

July 1, 2025

“We had this vision to take the K out of K-pop and make it global.” This is the sales pitch that begins Pop Star Academy: KATSEYE, a documentary about the titular girl group, who are signed to Korea's HYBE (BTS) and America's Geffen (Olivia Rodrigo). Later in the film, the CEO of Interscope Geffen A&M proclaims their endeavor unprecedented, explaining that the labels are applying K-pop training practices but “doing it in pop music.” They seem confused. Are they adding the “K” or removing it? Is K-pop not “pop music”? Ignore the marketing tactics and the music tells all: KATSEYE, frequently touted as a uniquely global girl group, are awfully ordinary.

In many ways KATSEYE are the most unexceptional HYBE group to date, highly emblematic of mainstream K-pop's trajectory over the past decade. The success of the music competition show Produce 101 ushered in numerous acts formed via reality television. KATSEYE originated from another show, Dream Academy, and the members—as is common nowadays—hail from different countries and speak multiple languages. Sophia is from the Philippines; Manon is from Switzerland; Yoonchae is from Korea; and Daniela, Lara, and Megan are from the U.S. Even so, their songs are almost entirely in English. Without any songs in Korean, they're presumably not K-pop. And as the Korea-based, ethnically Japanese girl group XG proved before them, if you're singing in English, the type of pop music you make becomes hard to classify.

When music fans talk about “pop,” or use the glaringly specious “pure pop,” they are often referring to what I call A-pop, or American pop music. Just as “American” can be wielded as a nebulous term that ignores minority groups, so too is A-pop defined by its nonspecificity and de facto whiteness (“pure pop” rarely describes R&B, for instance). If there is rapping, it's stripped of regional signifiers. If there's a dembow riddim, it's not Jamaican or Latin so much as in the lineage of Justin Bieber's “Sorry.” KATSEYE's second EP, BEAUTIFUL CHAOS, often falls into this terrible A-pop pitfall: pan-global mush. The bilingual “Gabriela” is the worst offender; it has a reggae bassline and Spanish guitar, but they're in service of something nondescript—inoffensive music for the incurious listener. (It was previously offered to Rita Ora.)

For decades K-pop groups have thrived in their willingness to be derivative, finding success in a domestic market by trafficking interpretations of the “real thing.” K-pop's first generation was endearingly slapdash in their stylistic homage, with songs frequently anchored by karaoke-ready balladry. Genre agnosticism and shameless inauthenticity became the prevailing methodologies thereafter, and there is always something fascinating in the gap between original copy and ostensible ripoff. Though BEAUTIFUL CHAOS is a more mature offering than the mawkish teen pop of KATSEYE's debut EP, SIS (Soft Is Strong), its game of “spot the difference” is often a matter of “sounds like X but worse.” “M.I.A,” for example, imagines the most sedate version of “like JENNIE,” itself a degree of separation removed from the Brazilian phonk it's indebted to. KATSEYE's chanting can't mask the anodyne spirit, and the song limps to the finish line. If K-pop sounds fresh, it's because it treats established formulas as suggestions; KATSEYE's music sounds generic because it treats the well-trod as bullseyes.

KATSEYE's problem is a familiar one in A-pop: They're tasteful and aggressively risk-averse, unable to shed the requisite self-consciousness to embrace novelty or sentimentality. (This year, KIIRAS' “KILL MA BO$$” and NMIXX's “High Horse” are K-pop's standard bearers in these modes, respectively.) Recently, one could trace the differences between PinkPantheress and NewJeans and Erika de Casier, carving out theories for the cultural nuances that explain each act's approach to intimacy. KATSEYE's works don't invite such inquiry because they don't belong to a particular culture. Instead of transcending borders, a humdrum EDM ballad like “Mean Girls” feels most at home on Spotify's mood playlists. A decade ago, a song in this lane would've veered toward trop-house or whatever the Chainsmokers were doing, but now there's gauzy atmosphere, hushed vocals, and muted kicks approximating Jersey club. Still, “Mean Girls” has one thing over any K-pop song: Less beholden to the industry's conservatism, KATSEYE sing an unambiguously pro-trans lyric (“God bless the t-girls/And all the in-between girls”).

Part of why KATSEYE's music is so disappointing is that they clearly occupy a fertile space. Take a look at the Hot 100 throughout the past few years and you'll see pop in numerous forms: R&B and EDM, country and rap, corridos and reggaeton, Afrobeats and K-pop. KATSEYE doesn't neatly slot into any of these styles, and they're doing what they can to fill in the gaps. The issue is that even though BEAUTIFUL CHAOS has five distinct songs, they scan as haphazard attempts at seeing what sticks. Their last EP's best song was the perfectly fine “Touch,” an A-pop take on K-pop's “hook song” formula. The closest analogue here is the blippy “Gameboy,” but without the ultra-repetitive chorus, it sounds like little more than an Ariana Grande reject. There's no honing of craft or style or identity on this second project; KATSEYE remain aspirational jacks of all trades.

Ultimately, KATSEYE have the unenviable task of making new songs in a musically unadventurous niche. It's why “Gnarly,” an abrasive hyperpop song co-written by Alice Longyu Gao, is the most interesting of their career. It's big and dumb and obnoxious; in other words, it has a personality. It recalls SOPHIE's maxim that “all pop music should be about who can make the loudest, brightest thing.” And while it isn't fully satisfying as a song itself (Gao's original snippet appeared on TikTok, which suits a track this silly and short), “Gnarly” provides a glimpse into what KATSEYE could do to live up to their promise as a global girl group. They have the potential to be more than K-pop or A-pop, but they'll have to upend musical conventions first. Otherwise, they'll keep treating trends as stylistic dead ends.

Why review a new Merzbow record in 2025? What can, after all, be said about Masami Akita's ultra-strident tessellations of sound—where total control masquerades as abject chaos, where extreme volume is a dare to lean in a little closer—that hasn't already been uttered? Across the last half-century, he has become the metonym of harsh noise while also existing far beyond it, with frequent forays into grindcore bedlam and doom marches, ambient hum and free jazz eruptions. Box sets of 35 and 50 CDs, multiple series of albums that run for years, a collaborative zeal that seems boundless: Merzbow is so prolific that browsing his discography is like autoscrolling an abyss, revealing a catalogue so daunting that many people understandably stand only near its edges. Depending on how you tally them, Merzbow has released almost a dozen titles in the first six months of 2025. What is the point of describing a single drop of water when the bucket is already overflowing?

The simplest answer is maybe half-right: Because he still fucking goes. Merzbow has been charting, destroying, and charting again the outermost edges of sound for nearly five decades; in that time, few others have ever come back with reports so vivid and daunting, so aggressive and nuanced, so exhilarating and enervating. With its laundry-room sense of arrhythmia, blown-out paroxysms of feedback and distortion, and body-quaking drops of bass, the four-track Sedonis serves as a summary of where he has been, a capable introduction that points back to landmarks like Rainbow Electronics, Venereology, and Merzbient. But in its precision and payload, it also exclaims that Merzbow is not yet finished getting to where he is going. This is the work of a craftsperson who has relentlessly honed his skills but who seems as excited by the electricity and possibility of it all as he was in 1997, when he told Perfect Sound Forever “My music is not only my reaction against other music. It's just my way.”

It is tempting to call Merzbow's stuff “sculptural,” both as a way to recognize the intentional contour and depth of it all and to dispel the reductive even-I-can-do-that criticisms that have forever dogged him. It is one thing to make noise; it is another altogether to shape it, to mold it. But I have never seen a sculpture move quite like Sedonis, where ceaseless layers alternately summon a hellish symphony, a collapsing dub sound system, and an auto-workers union whose members like to read John Cage essays and watch Einstürzende Neubauten clips in the break room. Anything but static, this is, instead, incredibly athletic music, where moments of power, agility, and grace feel astonishing.

Those instances will vary from listener to listener; Merzbow's music has always been a series of Rorschach tests, the frames often moving at such high speeds you can barely register them. For me, it's the spot where, three minutes into “Sedonis B,” he opens up just enough space amid what sounds like the shattering glass of a terrifying car crash to let in a brief fusillade of brutal bass tones; they surprise me each time, like body blows from a prizefighter who was only teasing me by aiming at my face. There's an infernal buzz that emerges from a whirlpool of oscillators nine minutes into “Sedonis C,” suggesting a swarm of irate mosquitoes, flying into battle. And almost 11 minutes into the half-meditative, half-tormenting finale, “Monolith 4,” there's a bit that lands like my personal paragon of harsh noise—a curved wall of static suddenly split open by a high tone so pure and piercing it seems too punishing to be intentional. A fluttering little keyboard line in the background rings like a telephone, as if someone were calling to say, “Hey, do you need help in there?”

Speaking of which, the more complicated—and, for me, correct—answer to the question of why we might need more Merzbow in 2025 is that it feels really good to hear this music right now, to be overrun by the force of it all. During the last two decades, gaggles of harsh noise kids, myself included, eased into the more placid realms of drone, ambient, and new age, a reasonable response to both the onset of adulthood and the inevitable anxiety of instant information about everything. Lately, though, I've found myself reverting to the old roar, since scoring dread with a nice little hum underlines rather than outstrips the worry. It's not enough to be distracted.

Sedonis offers the opposite. I've found myself playing it loudly in a series of tiny rooms with enormous speakers, especially after long days of bad news, and reveling in the way it allows space for nothing else. It is strangely cleansing to submit to Merzbow in 2025, to let him offer a mind-eraser for these 37 righteous minutes of roiling noise. Yes, that's probably bad for my burgeoning tinnitus; it appears salubrious, though, for every other inch of my brain.

Merzbow is a punchline, a rhetorical crutch, and surely the only such artist to inspire two podcasts, especially ones that had some interest outside his niche. He is the name you might invoke when you want to make a joke about some grating sound you've heard amid city traffic. He plays into the humor, too, with punny album titles and cute album covers where he's, like, jamming on a laptop underwater with a dolphin. But as he eyes his sixth decade of noise, it is only becoming clear how singular his career has been and still is. He just closed a magnificent nine-album series where beauty and terror were inextricably bound and which ranks as some of the best work of his career. And then there is Sedonis, all tumult and ecstasy, confusion and control—as fucked up as our times, as persistent as the man who made it.

Nikki Nair's new EP is very much a record for our times. In times as eventful and fast-moving as these, that phrase refers to a shorter span than it normally would—less an era, more a financial quarter. The title, Violence Is the Answer, could be a riff on any number of 2025's events so far, from Luigi Mangione's alleged killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, to, more broadly, the unprecedented level of political violence in the U.S. over the past year. On “Smooth,” Nair lazily croons, as if rubbing his temples from stress, “I just need someone to pay my bills while the violence continues.” I feel that. I think a lot of us do. On a lighter note, the EP also contains a track about filing taxes, which, like something out of a Pynchon novel, is both a jokey love song and a satire about wage slavery: “Going to work I want to walk right into traffic/(Just wanna file my taxes with you)/But I know if I did that then you'd have to file alone.”

That a dance music EP should have such depth and wit shows what makes Nikki Nair great. The L.A.-via-Atlanta-via-Knoxville producer forged his art at DIY shows—a far cry from the nightclubs and music festivals that shaped so many of his peers. This gives his music, even when it's perfectly groovy and what you could call “DJ-friendly,” a unique punkish flair. Stylistically, his music is gleefully unbound by conventions of genre and, often, the needs of the club—including by centering the lyrics, which Nair himself often sings.

That is perhaps more true on Violence Is the Answer than on any of Nair's previous releases. The record contains what may be one of the strangest genre mashups of all time: “Juliette,” a collaboration with Harmony Tividad and Blaketheman1000 that successfully melds twee indie vocals and guitars with stuttering footwork drums and samples of cocking guns. This kind of scampish boundary-pushing is the EP's strength as much as its weakness. “Juliette” is a trick well-landed: an impressive feat of musical synergy, but not much more. It has none of the personality or emotional depth of the indie rock it's drawing from. And, outside a basement show or, perhaps, a set by DJ Bus Replacement Service, its dance floor potential is nonexistent.

Nair has an impressive command of a wide range of genres, able to confidently switch across them from one record to the next. Unfortunately, his sound of choice this time around is a kind of PC Music-style hyperpop, and though he captures its lurid funhouse energy, his take lacks the subtle gravitas that characterizes the best versions of this music. Also, while I can understand how this kind of demented vibe works within the context of our deeply weird era, I'd personally need Brat Summer to be a little farther in the rearview before I could get down to this sort of sound again.

A more recent strength of Nair's, evidently, is his pull with collaborators—a result, no doubt, of his rapidly growing clout as an artist. But here, the guest appearances are hit-and-miss. On “Somebody,” the Irish artist yunè pinku makes the same kind of logic-defying fusion that Nair, Tividad, and Blaketheman1000 pull off on “Juliette,” her beautifully rich vocals somehow jelling with Nair's mutant two-step beat (and, again, guns cocking). The EP's two Uffie collabs, meanwhile, are more interesting on paper than in practice: Basically, she raps over footwork and electro beats (plus more samples of guns clacking). It sounds generic—not like something that could only have come from a bloghouse legend.

Nair makes music at a prolific rate, with north of 25 records to his name since he debuted in 2018. It tracks with his general DGAF attitude that he'd whack something like this onto Bandcamp without thinking too hard about it. And, ultimately, this off-the-cuff, anything-goes energy is something the often too-staid world of dance music could use much more of. An inevitable cost of that MO, though, is that alongside the releases that really resonate come the minor works and mere curiosities, the kind of tracks that would remain sketches on another artist's harddrive. That's what we're getting on Violence Is the Answer: further evidence of a vital talent, but not a release you're going to be reaching for all summer.

	As Elon Musk continues to bash the Republican reconciliation bill, President Donald Trump is threatening consequences against the man who dumped hundreds of millions of dollars into his 2024 campaign, and who just months ago was effectively operating as his co-president. 


	Musk's opposition to the bill led to an explosive war of words between him and Trump last month. The Tesla billionaire renewed his criticism this week, writing on Monday that if “this insane spending bill passes,” he would form his own political party, the ”America Party,” the next day. “Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a VOICE,” Musk wrote.  


	Musk added that he would ensure that every member of Congress who “campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history” would “lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.” 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In a Truth Social post early Tuesday morning, Trump blamed Musk's outburst on his administration's move to revoke state-level electric vehicle mandates, which heavily benefit electric car companies like Tesla. 


	“Elon Musk knew, long before he so strongly Endorsed me for President, that I was strongly against the EV Mandate. It is ridiculous, and was always a major part of my campaign,” the president wrote. “Elon may get more subsidies than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa.” 

	











	The president added that “perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look,” at Musk's companies and government contracts because there was “BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!” 


	While speaking to reporters before heading to Florida hours later, Trump was asked if he was going to deport Musk. “I don't know, we'll have to take a look,” the president mused, adding that  the administration “might have to put DOGE on Elon.” 


	“You know what DOGE is?” he asked the reporter, referring to Musk's supposed cost-cutting operation that gutted critical services across the government in a matter of months. “The monster that might have to go back and eat Elon,” Trump continued. “Wouldn't that be terrible?” 


	Musk responded on X that it was “so tempting to escalate this. So, so tempting. But I will refrain for now.”

	The GOP's massive reconciliation package is currently being debated in the Senate through a record breaking vote-a-rama session that became the longest in the chamber's history on Monday night. If passed, the legislation is expected to strip millions of their health care coverage, make social safety net programs less accessible, and worst of all — at least according to Musk — increase the national debt by about $4 trillion over 10 years. 


	Trump indicated on Tuesday that he was “hopeful” for a full vote in the Senate before the end of the day.

	Jonathan Bernstein



	Earlier this month, Zohran Mamdani went on Hot 97, New York's preeminent hip-hop radio station, to tell the story of how he first entered politics. It's a tale he's told many times: In 2015, Mamdani started knocking on doors for an aspiring Queens city councilman, Ali Najmi. But when he told it this time, Mamdani highlighted the real reason he wanted to get involved.


	That reason was Himanshu Suri, the Queens-raised rapper and co-founder of the groups Das Racist and Swet Shop Boys. Suri, better known as Heems, grew up with Najmi and had been campaigning on his childhood friend's behalf. “I actually got involved in local politics because I picked up a copy of the Village Voice in 2015 where I saw that Heems, who was one of my favorite rappers, was endorsing his childhood friend,” Mamdani told the radio station, before pausing: “Heems,” Mamdani repeated, raising his fingers with a smile. “Shout-out to Heems.”


	When Rolling Stone spoke with Heems shortly after the primary, the longtime artist and activist couldn't believe the impact his niche hip-hop career ended up having on his hometown's possible future mayor. “I'm extremely grateful, and I'm extremely surprised,” Suri says. “My first thought was ‘Fuck it, I'll make music for another couple of years.'”

	











	Before Mamdani became the Democratic candidate in New York's mayoral race and the new face of American left-wing politics, he was, among other things, a twentysomething Heems stan and reply guy. Throughout the mid-2010s, Mamdani, 33, regularly tweeted at Heems, to no response, suggesting Swet Shop Boys merch ideas and asking the rapper if he'd read the memoir Curfewed Night.  

	











	“Big boss,” Mamdani, then 23, tweeted at Heems in 2015, “I ordered [Heems' 2015 LP] ‘Eat Pray Thug' a month ago-when should I expect it at the crib? Much love.” When Heems set up a donation page for his artist website in 2015, Mamdani chimed in: 


	“Just donated,” he tweeted at the rapper, “because @Swetshopboys 1st EP was 🔥🔥🔥”

	A decade later, Heems is tickled by the turn of events: “The guy everyone donated to donated to me!” 

@HIMANSHU Big boss. I ordered ""Eat Pray Thug"" a month ago – when should I expect it at the crib? Much love.


	There are number of parallels between Suri and Mamdani: Both were South Asian rappers (Mamdani famously had a brief period rapping as Mr. Cardamom), both have made debt relief for New York taxi drivers one of their foremost issues, and both have intertwined art and politics in their varied careers and roles.


	It's this last point that Heems views as instrumental to understanding Mamdani's past, present, and future as a democratic socialist: “The thing about rap music is that it's a community art form that's rooted in the working class,” he says. “Its two themes are aspiration and struggle, right? So to have somebody that innately understands rap music is to have somebody that innately understands community, struggle, and aspiration. That means understanding people around you that are having trouble making ends meet and that wanna come up.”


	To Heems, it's no coincidence at all that Mamdani's political origins — door-knocking for Najmi's city council campaign — are based, like rap, in crafting narratives about a community. “He comes from that community-organizing world, which is rooted in the streets the same way rap music is,” says Suri. “Rap is storytelling; it's not necessarily story-making, it's story-telling. [Mamdani's victory] is about having somebody that knows what the stories of everybody's independent main-character syndrome is, who can go out there and enact actual change on the ground, from those concerns, from those stories, from those character arcs.”

	HEEMS HAS BEEN making music since the late aughts, when his first rap group, Das Racist, broke out with their viral hit “Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.” Since then, on solo records like Eat Pray Thug and Swet Shop Boys' 2016 LP Cashmere, Suri has used his platform as a critic's darling to highlight local issues. In 2012, Suri released his mixtape Nehru Jackets as part of a platform to raise awareness and make noise in Albany about redistricting and gerrymandering in Queens. In 2015, Heems, whose father drove a cab, rallied to get a taxi stand installed outside of Lower East Side institution the Punjabi Deli, which was facing eviction because its customer base — cab drivers — could no longer patronize the business without getting ticketed. “As an artist, I'm not a millionaire, man, but when I see that cab stand on Houston [Street], I feel pretty damn good about the songs I make in a garage,” Suri says. 

	











	Meanwhile, Heems is looking ahead to a number of musical projects. He is working on an indie-rock-leaning project that will feature Lee Ranaldo and Panda Bear, and says a song with Unknown Mortal Orchestra is dropping next month. He's also been discussing another Swet Shop Boys album with Riz Ahmed. 


	He's also optimistic about New York's future. “The words ‘hopeful' and ‘triumphant' come to mind,” he says of his mood after the primary. “Somebody asked me to make a playlist celebrating the moment, and the two songs that came to mind were ‘We Gonna Make It,' by Jadakiss, and ‘A Change Is Gonna Come,' by Sam Cooke.” 


	What does Heems think of New York's current mayor? “I have reason to believe Eric Adams doesn't know who Mobb Deep is, but if he does, he doesn't fuck with them like that,” says Suri. “I could go with a cop or I could go with a fan of Mobb Deep. Maybe it's a silly way to look at the world, but I'm going to go with the fan of Mobb Deep.”


	Heems looks forward to hopefully discussing his shared interest in the ongoing taxi debt-relief crisis with Mamdani. “What the city gave them wasn't enough, and it wasn't what they said they would, and they're still struggling,” Suri says. “That's something I want to talk about more. The number-one cause in my heart will always be taxi workers.”

	But what Heems is most excited about is the values of the man he inspired to enter politics. 


	“What's crazy in this moment for me, who's so aligned with the interests of the South Asian community, is that I'm much more happy that our potential next mayor is aligned with issues of the working class,” says Suri. “It hasn't even struck me: ‘We may have an Indian mayor.' What's striking me more is ‘Shit, we have have a socialist mayor who cares about the working class and basics of Maslow's hierarchy of needs: food and shelter. That shit excites me. I can separate my personal connection and my ethnicity from just like, “Oh, shit, we might have a mayor who gives a fuck.'”

Lena Dunham explained why she took an “intentional break” from acting after her HBO series Girls came to an end in 2017. Speaking to the Times, Dunham said she stepped back from public life after facing backlash for a series of controversies.


	“I didn't really understand how to distinguish between what was and wasn't necessary for the public,” she said. “I felt confused about how I was supposed to respond. I thought if I explain properly who I am, or give a glimpse of who I am, people are going to have a different perception of me, that we would be friends. But no one cares — and that's fine.” 


	During Girls, which ran for six seasons from 2012 to 2017, Dunham faced backlash for the show's frank depiction of sex, nudity, and abortion, but also for her public comments about the series. She once said in an interview that while she had never had an abortion she wished she had. She defended the Girls' writer Murray Millar after he was accused of sexual assault. “I always joke that I need a T-shirt that says, ‘I survived New York media in 2012 and all I got was this lousy T-shirt,'” Dunham said. “And all I got was this lousy PTSD.”

	











	After the show ended, Dunham became addicted to prescription anxiety medication. She told the Times that “had a lot to do with managing my physical pain.” She also went to rehab. 


	“I felt like all the maturing and changing that had been kept at bay by the experience of being in that cocoon of the show was suddenly happening at a speed that was overwhelming,” she said. “It was a painful metamorphosis. I definitely took an intentional break [from public life].”

	











	Dunham's new show, Too Much, premieres on Netflix on July 10. It stars Meg Stalter as a New Yorker named Jessica who moves to London after a breakup. She soon begins a relationship with quirky indie musician Felix, played by Will Sharpe. The show was co-created by Dunham, who plays Jessica's sister, and her real-life musician husband Luis Felber. It has a more romantic vibe than Girls, which Dunham told the Times was purposeful.

	“That was clearly a reflection of how I saw my twenties,” Dunham explained of Girls. “It's interesting — when I am reminded of the seasons [of Girls], I can see what I was thinking, what place I was in, when I was falling in love, when I was in pain. It's all in there. I also felt in my twenties there was something embarrassing about writing things that were saccharine or sincere or happy. I was much more interested in irony and satire and harshness and surprising and sometimes scandalizing people. I felt like I needed to reflect the toughest aspects of life back to people so that they would feel less alone. And now I think maybe you can reflect the sweeter parts of life to people so they can feel hopeful.”


	Elsewhere in the interview, Dunham reflected on her friendship with Taylor Swift, who she described as a role model. “She's a mind-blowing person,” Dunham said. “I think she's extraordinarily well adjusted and emotionally intuitive. And it's really amazing for young women to see that in front of them.”

	In 2017, Dunham told Rolling Stone that she was inspired by Swift's ability to navigate being in the public eye. “I felt young when my career started and I was 23, 24,” Dunham said. “When I met her, she was newly 22, and she was a fucking seasoned pro at this stuff. Watching the way that she understands the vicissitudes of the cycle, and she just keeps making her work — that's just really impressive to me. That's how I hope to live my life, which is not as a slave to public opinion, but just as somebody who continues to make things.”


	She continued, “She's truly just an artist who has to make things to survive. I guess that's what we have most in common. And she's never not making music. If people know about it or they don't, she's never not making music, and that's like, something that I've really watched with a lot of admiration.  Because she's been put through the wringer, and she's continued to make her work. People who understand how to protect themselves but aren't so beaten down that they can't be creative — that to me is the greatest.”

	President Donald Trump and the GOP's so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” is far from beautiful and deeply unpopular with the public. Battling concerns from voters about increased barriers to accessing programs like Medicaid and food assistance; massive transfers of wealth from less fortunate Americans to corporations and the rich; and the mass deregulation of industries like crypto and AI, Vice President J.D. Vance is attempting a new tactic to persuade the hesitant: ignore all of that and focus on how much money the bill is giving to ICE. 


	“The thing that will bankrupt this country more than any other policy is flooding the country with illegal immigration and then giving those migrants generous benefits. The [One Big Beautiful Bill] fixes this problem. And therefore it must pass,” Vance wrote Tuesday on X. 


	“Everything else — the CBO score, the proper baseline, the minutiae of the Medicaid policy — is immaterial compared to the ICE money and immigration enforcement provisions,” he added.

	The millions of people who are expected to lose access to their health insurance as a result of the legislation would likely beg to differ. 


	The version of the legislation passed by the House would give Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) over $100 billion for the construction of new immigration detention centers, increasing arrest and deportation efforts, militarization of the border and the hiring of new agents. 


	Such a massive windfall for immigration enforcement comes as ICE has blown through its annual budget months before the end of the fiscal year. In May, during a hearing of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) laid into the reckless spending of the Department of Homeland Security under Secretary Kristi Noem. 

	











	“You are spending like you don't have a budget. You are on the verge of running out of money for the fiscal year […] You are ignoring the immigration laws of this nation, implementing a brand-new immigration system that you have invented that has little relation to the statutes that you are required — that you are commanded — to follow as spelled out in your oath of office,“ Murphy said. “Your agency acts as if laws don't matter, as if the election gave you some mandate to violate the Constitution and the laws passed by this Congress. It did not give you that mandate.”

	Through the reconciliation bill and presidential policy, Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration are looking to give DHS and ICE that mandate. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has demanded that ICE detain at least 3,000 migrants a day. As the reconciliation bill continues to move through the Senate, Trump and Noem traveled to Florida on Tuesday to tour the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz,” a migrant detention center built in the hostile backwaters of the Florida Everglades.

	“We're going to teach them how to run away from an alligator,” Trump said ahead of his visit to the center. “Don't run in a straight line,” Trump said, waving his hand in a zig-zag to demonstrate how a detainee might potentially need to move to escape a half-ton reptile.


	This kind of callous cruelty is what the administration is focused on, whether it be its treatment of migrants, or dismissing kicking millions off of their health care as insignificant “minutiae.”

B

y Nov. 3, 2020, the day of the presidential election, 44-year-old Ian Rogers had been preparing for the implosion of American civilization for so long that it seemed like a foregone conclusion. He could see the coded signals, the power grabbing, and he was confident it would all culminate in the Democratic Party stealing the White House for Joe Biden and establishing a police state. Rogers, who had spent most of his life in California's wine country, where he owned a car-repair shop, expected to lose cherished freedoms — in particular, gun rights. A feeling of profound, imminent loss had settled over him. If armed resistance became necessary, Rogers considered himself a man of action. When the election results came in, he decided it was time to move.


	Between Nov. 25, 2020, some two weeks after most news organizations declared a Democratic victory, and Jan. 13, 2021, court records show Rogers initiated a series of domestic terrorism planning sessions with his best friend, 37-year-old Jarrod Copeland. Over text messages, they discussed how to carry out an attack against institutions they saw as liberal. Among the targets discussed were Twitter and Facebook, both of which had recently banned Donald Trump; the California governor's mansion, inhabited by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom; and the Democratic Party headquarters in Sacramento.

	“Ok bro we need to hit the enemy in the mouth,” Rogers said in November. “I think right now we attack democrats.” He added, “I'm thinking full auto fire with fire will send the message we want.” Two days later, Rogers sent Copeland a map that showed the location of the state Democratic Party's headquarters, a low-slung building with rooftop solar panels and charging stations for electrical vehicles. “150 rounds shot into [the] building will destroy it,” Rogers said. “And a couple pipe bombs.” He wanted to “send a fucking message man” and “scare the whole country” and “leave [an] envelope with our demands and intentions” that would effectively state “we declare war on the Democratic Party and all traitors to the republic.”

	











	Rogers and Copeland moved on to logistics. “After work tomorrow I'll … do some recon,” Rogers said. “I'll scope things out take pictures.” Copeland told him, “If they don't listen to trump they will hear us,” and in January texted, “we will become outlaws for real.”

	Copeland, who had joined the military in 2013, only to be arrested twice for desertion before receiving an “Other Than Honorable” discharge in 2016, purchased a 10-pack of zip-tie handcuffs. The two men discussed the necessity of “guerrilla warfare,” “surgical strikes,” and “civil war.” Rogers declared them “freedom fighters.”


	As January 2021 progressed, the conversation turned fatalistic. Rogers asked, “Are you ready to leave your wife? What I'm talking about we probably will die unfortunately.” Copeland had reservations about that aspect of the plan, but said, “She has finally come around to understanding.”


	Ian Rogers owned some 50 firearms, including 13 different types of semiautomatic 1911 handguns, and multiple assault rifles, such as two AR-15s. There were also four illegal automatic weapons: a bipod-mounted, belt-fed, open-bolt MG-42 machine gun; an AK-47 with an under-fold stock; an AK-47 with a side-fold stock; and an M-16. He had stockpiled 15,000 rounds of ammunition and five fully assembled, illegal pipe bombs. Among his weapons were books and manuals: The Anarchist Cookbook, U.S. Army Improvised Munitions Handbook, Homemade C-4: A Recipe for Survival, and U.S. Army Special Forces Guide to Unconventional Warfare.

	Rogers had a stash of steroids, and a Three Percenters militia sticker on his vehicle. He kept a “White Privilege Card” that said “Trumps Everything” and contained the numbers “0045,” an apparent reference to the 45th president of the United States.


	Before Rogers and Copeland could carry out their violent plans, police followed through on a tip and arrested Rogers on Jan. 15, 2021. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy and illegal weapons possession and received a nine-year prison sentence. Copeland admitted to his role as co-conspirator and received a sentence half as long. 


	From Rogers' perspective, his plea deal was less an acknowledgement of wrongdoing than a rational response to poor odds. Over the course of his confinement, and despite the facts of the case, his views have remained intact.


	Rogers insists he is not violent or a domestic terrorist. “I wouldn't hurt a fly,” he told me earlier this year, over a prison phone. He is also certain that he is a “patriot” and a “political prisoner.” If he was guilty of anything at all, he said, it was the “cardinal sin [of] being a Republican in America” after Jan. 6.


	It is not, from Rogers' perspective, his fault that he can see hidden machinations, which show that the fix is in. The 2020 election, Rogers wrote to me, was “100% stolen.” And it goes without saying that the Democratic Party is “the greatest threat facing the United States today.” Rogers said, “Just as Rome was brought down by enemies within, we have such traitors amongst us now,” adding, “These people fundamentally hate the country and they will do anything to impose their vision on the nation.”

	











	Rogers told me, as he told law enforcement after his arrest, that he's an alcoholic, and at the time he and Copeland were planning the attack he was consuming a dozen beers a night. He was drunk, his words were meaningless, not literal, just loose talk in a private chat. “I had no idea the 1st Amendment no longer was in effect,” Rogers later wrote. “That the 1st Amendment was just words on paper, useless, forgotten, replaced by tyranny.”


	Rogers, a conservative white man, tall and muscular with tattoos on his shoulders that pay homage to his German and English ancestry, has a conspiratorial mindset. His belief in his innocence requires an ideological reading of the hard facts of his crimes. Conspiracy ties events together into a subversive political plot engineered by Democrats and justifies his actions. This way of thinking has grown more prevalent in the era of Donald Trump and Covid, leading to the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, and radicalization of a man named Vance Boelter, who was charged with shooting two Minnesota state lawmakers and their spouses on June 14.


	Boelter — doomsday prepper, ardent Trump supporter, white Evangelical Christian — had created a list of 70 targets that included Minnesota's Democratic congressional delegation and locations for Planned Parenthood, according to law enforcement. In a sermon, he once said, in reference to trans people, “The enemy has gotten so far into their mind and their soul.” When his car was recovered by police, they found multiple AK-47s and flyers for anti-Trump “No Kings” protests, suggesting he planned to show up at one of those events after killing lawmakers and open fire.


	In the case of Rogers, evidence makes clear he did not adopt the conspiratorial mindset and acquire the means for an act of violence in a vacuum. By the time he reached the age of 44, he was deep into an indoctrination process that began on his 21st birthday, when he bought his first firearm, a Heckler & Koch USP .40 pistol. 


	DESPITE MAKING UP ONLY 30 percent of America's population, the core of the country's gun market is composed of white men, or rather a subset of white men, since only a portion of them own and continually purchase firearms. Without these buyers, civilian sales would collapse, which the gun industry knows. Still, the industry is defensive about the role it plays in arming this demographic. The image of such individuals wielding their firearms can bring to mind racial terrorism, violent political radicalism, and mass shootings. Men like Ian Rogers remind the public that in order for an extremist to attack, someone must supply weapons.

	











	More than a decade ago, the National Rifle Association began an attempt at rebranding itself, obscuring this connection. It hired its first prominent Black spokesperson, a young, athletic YouTube influencer and gun enthusiast named Colion Noir. As he began his new role, the organization dispatched a crew to interview him on a gun range. The raw footage, never before made public, shows him dressed in a black baseball cap and long-sleeve shirt. After Noir introduces himself, he says that he's “passionate about concealed carry,” and rejects the assumption that firearms are for people “living in a rural setting.” The producer points out, “You're able to bring a perspective that the NRA has not really embraced before,” adding, “talk about that to the camera.” Noir responds, “So, there's a lot of talk and a lot of mention about my race, obviously. And I can understand that to a degree … considering that there really hasn't been a Black face of the NRA, so to speak.” He goes on: “I really am appreciative of the opportunity to utilize the NRA's platform, and I'm also very thankful that they were able to reach out to me and see the need for that and embrace it.”


	Noir is no longer with the NRA. He told me, of his time there, that the “organization understood what its perception was to most people; they're not dumb.” He had creative control over his content, and feels his experience at the NRA was generally positive, but, he acknowledges, “They were absolutely using me. I knew they were using me, and I was fine with it because I inherently believed in what they were doing.”


	The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the nonprofit that serves as the gun industry's trade group, has similarly attempted to alter the public's perception. Working on a parallel track to the NRA, which loudly represents the interests of gun owners, the NSSF is staid by comparison and focuses on ensuring the future of the firearms business. The organization, which declined to comment for this story, quietly lobbies on behalf of dues-paying gun manufacturers and retailers, and every year hosts the SHOT Show in Las Vegas, the industry's biggest trade event. During the pandemic, amid a record-breaking boost in gun sales, Lawrence Keane, one of the NSSF's top executives, wrote in a post on the organization's website that a paradigm shift was underway. “Throw out the stereotypes on American gun ownership,” he said. “They're just wrong. Against the backdrop of historically high firearm sales, one major theme is shattering misconceptions that America's gun owners are ‘old white men.'” Keane went on, “Today's gun buyer looks more like the rest of America.”


	The claim was largely driven by the NSSF's retailer surveys, drawn from hundreds of gun retailers, and was amplified across the national press, which ran headlines like “Why More Black People Are Looking for Safety in Gun Ownership” and “Black Americans Have Been Buying More Guns During the Pandemic.” Unlike NSSF members, the public does not have ready access to the organization's gun-market research, which provides a view into the industry's best intelligence. The Trace and Rolling Stone obtained multiple NSSF research documents, including its most recent retailer surveys. In 2018, according to the surveys, 60 percent of gun buyers were white men. In 2020, as other demographics purchased more, that number did indeed drop — to 52 percent. But by 2022 that change had proved to be an aberration, as the number of white male customers once again approached 60 percent. Meanwhile, it was also the case that white men comprised 66 percent of retail staff, demonstrating that American gun culture is largely tribal.

	











	The NSSF's research also showed that first-time buyers do not account for the bulk of industry profits, comprising less than 23 percent of sales in 2022, a figure consistent with the years before the pandemic surge. That means once the gun industry brings a customer in, it must keep him, a task that requires not only the selling of guns but also the culture and politics of gun ownership. What makes white men in particular susceptible to this messaging is a matter of academic study. The sociologist Jennifer Carlson, a professor at Arizona State University, introduced the concept of the “citizen protector,” a man who experiences a sense of dislocation in today's America. He may be struggling economically, or feel he's not succeeding as a provider or a contributing member of the broader society. Deprived of a traditional masculine role, these men reimagine themselves as soldiers on the front lines, an honorable identity that bestows power. 


	Many white male gun owners do not neatly conform to this archetype, including enigmatic individuals like Thomas Matthew Crooks, who attempted to assassinate Donald Trump last year, and Luigi Mangione, who is accused of killing the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. Still, according to Angela Stroud, a sociologist and author of Good Guys With Guns, white men have more than any other group been “thoroughly inculcated with a culture of entitlement.” And yet, she says, “it is also true that white men have not kept up in this economy, even though they've been taught throughout history that they're going to have access to prosperity and power. So what you have is a sense of aggrieved entitlement, and that, in combination with guns, is extremely dangerous.” At the same time, Stroud adds, “The gun industry will do anything to sell you this product. The more fear the better. And in a culture that is becoming void of meaning for many people — the loss of work, community, religion — you can see how someone is not content to be a passive believer; they want to be a doer.” 


	From this vantage, it remains the case that Ian Rogers committed crimes, but it is also true that he is a fall guy for an industry that knows its best customers.

	











	ROGERS GREW UP IN SONOMA, a liberal stronghold, in a family of practicing Jehovah's Witnesses. There were, Rogers said, no firearms in their home, though his father, a mechanic, kept some at his shop. Rogers described his parents as “loving,” and said they didn't have much money. When it came to the children, they emphasized values. In a letter to the judge who oversaw Rogers' case, his father wrote that he preached “nonviolence and neutrality in political affairs.”


	In high school, Rogers rebuilt car engines and worked for his father. He learned to play the piano, the alto saxophone, and the guitar. When he was 18, he went to Wyoming Technical Institute, where he received an associate's degree in automotive technology. He became a master technician at 21, the same year he bought the Heckler & Koch USP .40 pistol. He soon married his first wife, Julie Crisci, who would later describe Rogers as “an intelligent, passionate, emotionally sensitive man with a big heart.” The couple had a son together who was around 11 at the time of Rogers' arrest. By all accounts, Rogers had been a caring, attentive father. He and his son rebuilt a Range Rover together, worked in the yard, and raised hens and roosters. Rogers and Crisci divorced in 2014. Looking back, Crisci wrote, “During our marriage Ian acquired many guns, which became one of his favorite hobbies. He collected guns in the same way I collect earrings or shoes. They were like art to him, and it gave him confidence knowing he could protect many people from harm if there were some disaster to befall us.”


	In his twenties, Rogers became a member of the National Rifle Association, and a regular reader of American Rifleman, the organization's flagship magazine, which provided an education on firearms, the gun industry, and, Rogers told me, “political problems.” He had joined the organization as it was changing. In 1994, an assault-weapons ban was moving through Congress, and the NRA used it as a rallying point, transforming the AR-15 into a symbol of resistance. “The Final War Has Begun,” Wayne LaPierre, then the head of the organization, wrote in American Rifleman. After then-President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law, the NRA spent more than it ever had before on that year's midterm elections and helped engineer a monumental Republican takeover of the House of Representatives. Violent impulses had been unleashed across the country. Timothy McVeigh, an NRA member, said that the ban was a significant factor in his decision to bomb a federal building in Oklahoma City the following year.


	In 1999, two students carried out a mass shooting at Columbine High School. The NRA used the impending threat of further restrictions to reinforce tribal membership, organizing its forces against a common enemy: the Democratic Party. The organization spent heavily in support of Republicans during the 2000 elections. Charlton Heston, then the NRA's president, said he wanted to “ensure that the Second Amendment was safe from Al Gore,” while LaPierre declared, “The Democratic National Committee is virtually one hundred percent anti-firearms ownership, and the Republican National Committee stands on the side of the freedom.”

	











	Then came an unprecedented national security crisis. Sept. 11, 2001, proved to be a galvanizing moment for the gun industry and how it would market weapons. American troops mobilized for war, backed by fervent civilian support, and the National Guard was deployed across America. Suddenly the AR-15 was everywhere, as authors Cameron McWhirter and Zusha Elinson write in their 2023 book, American Gun: The True Story of the AR-15. “These guys were our new heroes, and guess what they carried?” Doug Painter, who from 2002 to 2011 was the president and CEO of the NSSF, told the authors. “This really became the great unexpected ad campaign for the [AR] rifle.” Gun companies seized on the branding opportunity, explicitly tying civilian gun ownership to American soldiers. Smith & Wesson, for example, advertised that their AR-style weapon was “based upon combat-proven design.” Bill Silver, the head of commercial sales at Sig Sauer from 2005 to 2014, told the authors that the rifles had “the wannabe factor.” He went on, “People want to be a Special Forces guy,” and recalled telling his company's executives, “I'll sell as many as you can build.”


	Over time, Rogers absorbed the messaging of the gun industry and the NRA. “Without the NRA, the Democratic Party would have banned all guns by now and totalitarian government would have soon followed,” Rogers wrote to me in one letter. Over the phone, he said, “I believe the Second Amendment is the most important amendment in the constitution. I feel it provides protections for all the rest of them. If you take guns, the citizens are now subjects to a tyrannical government.” 


	The NRA did not respond to detailed, individual questions outlining the scope of this story. Instead, it emailed a statement that reads: “As the nation's oldest civil rights organization, the NRA promotes the safe and lawful use of firearms, as guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Our Association is comprised of Americans of all creeds and backgrounds — teachers, nurses, truck drivers, and farmers — who love their country and cherish the right to keep and bear arms. With more and more Americans purchasing firearms to protect themselves and their property, we will continue to carry out our mission since day one: to train the public on the safe and responsible use of firearms.”


	ROGERS OPENED HIS CAR-REPAIR BUSINESS in Napa in 2005. Soon, he said, “the stress started to take its toll.” There was so much to manage — finances, employees, quality control, customer satisfaction — and it all depended on him. Drinking beer helped Rogers decompress, but alcoholism ran in his family, and it quickly escalated. “Eventually my alcohol intake increased from three beers a night on Friday night and Saturday to 12 beers a night every day of the week,” he told me.

	











	The 2008 election approached. Rogers, still a Jehovah's Witness, was not permitted by his religion to vote, but he still considered himself naturally inclined toward conservatism, an instinct sharpened by the NRA, which, he told me, “reinforced my core beliefs.” The prospect of Barack Obama's presidency, and then the reality of it, further radicalized the right. Hysteria over his leadership became an ideology in and of itself. When Rogers was interviewed by police after his arrest, he said of the former president, “I hated him.”


	The NRA told its followers, ad nauseum, that Obama would be “the most anti-gun president in American history.” The assault-weapons ban was by this time no longer in effect, but the idea of scarcity animated the gun market. Dealers displayed prints of Obama that commanded, “Get 'em before he does.”


	Sales of AR-style weapons in particular accelerated, part of an industry-stoked phenomenon called “panic buying” that Salam Fatohi, the director of research at the NSSF, described in a 2024 deposition. The concept, he said, was widely understood within the industry, and he explained how it mobilized customers. “There's a rush of retail activity to go and legally purchase firearms that they, as consumers, could possibly not get at a later date,” Fatohi said. “They may not have planned to buy it then, but if it's going to be gone, they want to get their hands on it.”


	The AR-style weapons flowed almost exclusively to white men. The trend is captured in another NSSF study, which sought to provide clients and those who influence public policy with a wide range of “insights” on owners of AR and AK-style rifles, also known as assault weapons. In his deposition, Fatohi described the study's data as “a very large, usable sample,” and said it could be used to “represent” assault rifle owners. Between December 2021 and January 2022 more than 2,000 owners of these firearms were surveyed online, culminating in a “comprehensive consumer report” that found that 40 percent of respondents acquired their first assault rifle after 2009, and on average each respondent had come to own four. Ninety-six percent of those surveyed were men, and 88 percent were white. Nearly half said they kept at least a thousand rounds of ammunition on hand.


	AS OBAMA'S FIRST TERM CAME TOWARD A CLOSE, Ian Rogers was preparing to leave the Jehovah's Witnesses. He'd decided its approach to Christianity was wrong and the untethering led to a phase of self-discovery. Tribal constraints he'd lived with all his life had been lifted. But a void had also been opened, and it needed filling. Rogers became a Baptist, and, he told me, “got into politics as a hobby.” In 2012, at the age of 36, he voted in his first presidential election, for Mitt Romney. 

	











	The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had stretched into their first decade, and their continuation further cemented the country's partisan divisions. Navy SEALs like Chris Kyle and Marcus Luttrell became conservative pop-culture heroes. In 2013, the NRA was in the process of introducing a new slate of spokespeople, including a former SEAL named Dom Raso. He participated in an interview at a shooting range. The raw footage, never made public, shows Raso, who did not respond to a request for comment, dressed in camouflage military tactical gear, with an American flag patch sewn on the chest. He wears sporty sunglasses, his dark hair is gelled and spiky, and he holds an AR-15. He struggles with his answers, so the director guides him. “I'm assuming you're going to say something about [how] bad guys are everywhere, we can't be everywhere, you need to be able to stand up,” she tells him. Raso thanks her for the prompt and says to the camera, “There's evil everywhere in the world. It's always going to exist, and it's never going away. Guys like myself — guys that are like-minded people that want to protect you and other people out there — we want to be everywhere at once to protect everybody, but we just can't.” After the take, the director explains, “You're creating — it's what we talked about today even with your attire. You are creating a persona.”


	When Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign took shape, he openly embraced some of the darkest impulses that ran through the gun rights movement, and also framed his run as a final opportunity to stave off cultural extinction. At a rally, referring to Hillary Clinton, he said, “If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,” adding, “although the Second Amendment people — maybe there is, I don't know.” Trump won the election, and around then Rogers joined an offshoot of the Three Percenters, which Rogers later told police was “basically a prepper group” that interacted on Facebook, held weekly phone meetings, conducted field-training exercises, and hosted barbecues. Rogers told investigators that he'd tried to join the official militia, applying through its website, but never heard back.


	If President Obama had presented a marketing opportunity based on scarcity and loathing, then Trump — Obama's antithesis — required the leaders of the gun rights movement to search for a new way forward. As an internal 2017 NRA memo not previously made public noted, “While the election of President Trump has eased some concerns about threats to our freedoms, it has also unified our opposition. This is no time to rest on our laurels, we must continue to engage with our supporters and the American public.” It spoke of the organization's new “Freedom's Safest Place” advertising campaign. “These spots alert Americans to the threats to their freedoms that their leaders would rather ignore,” the memo said. “If we are going to defend our freedom, we must speak clearly and openly about the dangers of terrorism … dishonest leadership … hatred toward our law enforcement … how our culture of political correctness destroys our freedom of speech and religion … and throughout the series, how all freedoms are connected.”

	











	YEARS AGO, I WAS SPEAKING WITH a Florida politician named Dan Gelber, a prominent Democrat who served in the state legislature from 2000 to 2010, and later as mayor of Miami. He told me that a Republican colleague was fixated on the 1984 action film Red Dawn, about high school students who take to the mountains and organize an armed guerrilla resistance to a Soviet invasion of the United States. The colleague, Dennis Baxley, had functioned as a legislative proxy for the gun lobby in one of the most pro-gun states in the country, serving as a primary sponsor for NRA-crafted bills, including Stand Your Ground. In 2003, the organization tapped Baxley to carry legislation that prohibited police from maintaining a database on people who sold guns to pawn shops. To give the bill a sense of urgency, the text invoked the names of Hitler and Castro, and Gelber noticed that the arguments Baxley made in favor of its passage mimicked the premise of Red Dawn. After a hearing, Gelber asked Baxley about his observation. “You cracked the code,” answered the Republican lawmaker, who later confirmed Gelber's account to me in a text message, adding, “My work on this issue was also influenced by knowing Japan in WWII never attacked the US mainland as they were aware most Americans were armed civilians.” 


	Baxley came to mind recently because Rogers also told me he believes that civilian gun ownership deterred Japan from invading the United States mainland. This claim, which surfaces on social media from time to time, is apocryphal, and has been repeatedly debunked, including by USA Today, which found, after interviewing multiple historians, that such an invasion was never in play because Japan, at the time, was “badly overextended” and lacked the requisite resources. 


	The popularity of the Japan anecdote shows the power of theater and mythmaking. At times, Rogers ended his text messages to Jarrod Copeland with the word “Wolverines,” as in, “We shoot it up and burn it down, WOLVERINES.” In Red Dawn, the student guerrillas name themselves after their school mascot — the Wolverines. In the end, they prevail, sacrificing themselves for freedom. 

	











Red Dawn was written and directed by John Milius, who also co-wrote Apocalypse Now and later became something of a conservative icon who served on the board of the National Rifle Association through the 1990s and into the second decade of the 2000s. His movie is a Cold War film that was almost universally panned by critics as an extended piece of sentimental, right-wing agitprop that glorified violence — a potent militia fantasy. Its rejection by “elites” only reinforced the consensus on the right that the left hated America, further enhancing its appeal among conservatives. Milius, who did not respond to a request for comment, had a keen understanding of this dynamic and knew his film would tap into it. The memorial in the final scene, for example, is called “Partisan Rock.” 


	“I was the only person in Hollywood who would dare do this movie,” Milius said in bonus commentary he provided for a DVD release of the film. “I knew Hollywood would condemn me, that I would be regarded as a right-wing warmonger from then on.” He had created Red Dawn with an argument in mind. “My obsession is that guns give you a certain degree of freedom, and that our forefathers were very concerned about that freedom, you know, freedom from the government,” Milius told another interviewer. “And that right, once it's eroded, is the only thing you have, really.” 


	Whether consciously or not, the NRA tended to mimic the Red Dawn framework in its ads. One in 2015 featured Luttrell, the former Navy SEAL who Mark Wahlberg portrayed in the film Lone Survivor. Looking directly into the camera, Luttrell addresses an “Islamic extremist.” “I will never surrender my rights to your terror,” he says. “I will say what I think, worship according to my beliefs, and raise my children how I see fit. And I defend it all with the Second Amendment to the Constitution to the United States of America.”


	The threat of Islamic terrorism had become essential to NRA messaging. For instance, Charlie Daniels, the now-deceased country music star, began another ad by addressing “the Ayatollahs of Iran and every terrorist you enable.” The terrorists were the abstract enemy without. Meanwhile, communists were now the enemy within; they were gun-control activists, or, more broadly, Democrats. In 2018, less than two weeks after the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, Wayne LaPierre addressed an audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference. “On college campuses, The Communist Manifesto is one of the most frequently assigned texts,” he said. LaPierre added that in classrooms across the country the “Constitution is ignored, United States history is perverted, and the Second Amendment freedom in this country is despised.”

	











	The Luttrell and Daniels ads insinuated that it was up to armed civilians to thwart foreign terrorists who threatened to subjugate Americans. But LaPierre's words portrayed a less abstract, domestic enemy who sought to erase a way of life and leave Americans defenseless. 


	Rogers believed — and continues to believe — that it is up to him to stand against pervasive threats and protect the true America. The narrative gives his life a sense of dramatic purpose. “These commies need to be told what's up,” Rogers wrote at one point to Copeland. At another, in reference to the Democratic Party's headquarters in Sacramento, he said, “I think I'll do a drive bye and unload a couple drums into that commie building.” 


	After he was arrested, in January 2021, Rogers told police he owned a bulletproof vest, “just in case the Chinese invade.” 


	One officer asked him, “How do you feel about the way things are going in the country right now?”


	“I'm scared,” he said. “Democrats taking control. They got the Senate. I'm worried for my children, I really am.”


	“How so?” the officer asked.


	“Because it seems like the country is going communist,” he said.


	In a letter to me in March, Rogers wrote that Democrats are “modern day members of our 5th column and they are amongst us and causing havoc in our nation.” He added: “They absolutely hate the country and want to transform it into some kind of European socialist utopia. No thanks, that's not the kind of America I want to live in.”


	IAN ROGERS BEGAN AN ONLINE RELATIONSHIP with a woman named Yuliia in 2019. She lived in Ukraine with her young son, and communicated every day with Rogers. “We were endlessly in love with each other and could not wait for the decision of the immigration office so that we could start our family life together,” Yuliia wrote in a letter to the judge on Rogers' case. Rogers visited her in Ukraine twice, and she got her K-1 visa. Yuliia and her son came to America, and she and Rogers married on Feb. 14, 2020.

	











	Yuliia found her new husband's home to be a welcoming place. He had a pool and two dogs, and treated her son as if he were his own. She wrote that the boy had “finally found a loving father” who was “very kind to animals and children.” Yuliia said, “We were a big and friendly family.” 


	And yet, rather quickly, there were signs Rogers was coming apart. He could not cope with Covid restrictions or contain his anxiety. “I began to notice more and more tension in my husband,” Yuliia wrote. “He was worried that his business would get stuck and stop generating income. He was worried that he would not be able to provide for us and pay the mortgage on the house.”


	Stress about money merged with rage over lockdowns, which Rogers projected onto the Democratic leaders who ran his state. “If anything did ‘radicalize' me it was the Democratic response to the Covid-19 pandemic,” he told me. “‘The government' did this to impose their will on the people. To see how far they could push us. To see if we would do what they said.”


	Rogers' drinking worsened, and he grew increasingly reckless and unstable. “Ian is a very emotional person and takes everything to heart,” Yuliia wrote. “He is able to say stupid things under the influence of alcohol, but he is ashamed of it when he is sober.”


	Social-justice protests and civil unrest had broken out across the country in response to the murder of George Floyd. In August, Rogers texted his former brother-in-law a photograph of his five pipe bombs. “I made these today for when shit hits the fan,” he said. “Civil war is coming.” A few days later, while Rogers was drunk, he and Yuliia had an altercation. According to him, she learned that he had worked on an ex-girlfriend's car and was upset. He yelled “too loud” in response, and Yuliia ran out of the house with her phone, threatening to call the police. Rogers gave chase, and when he caught up to her, they both tumbled on the concrete. “The neighbors were there, saw the whole thing, and called the cops,” he said. “But it was all a bunch of crap over nothing.”


	Rogers was arrested, but the police dropped the charges. He was furious at his neighbors, and decided to sell his house and move an hour south, to a town called Berryessa. In September, he texted Julie Crisci, his ex-wife. “I hate this town I'll be happier away from the n—–s etc in Berryessa I'll see beauty every day,” he said, “and I'm sick of my stupid g–k neighbors.” 

	











	Rogers maintains that his texts about his neighbors were uncharacteristic. “In my cellphone I have text messages going all the way back to 2006,” he told me. “All those text messages, going back years and years, and all the police found is two or three racist drunk messages. Overall I'm doing pretty good. I'm not a racist, but sometimes when you're drunk you might say something stupid. That is what happened here.”


	When the 2020 election was called for Biden, it proved to be Rogers' undoing. He texted Copeland in early December, “Do you think something is wrong with me how I'm excited to attack the democrats?” 


	On Jan. 6, Copeland was ecstatic. He texted Rogers “REVOLUTION,” in all caps, three times. “Bro I'm juiced,” he said. “I have my g19 in my hand.” He wanted to “drive around and punish some bitches” and “Drink 4 Red Bull's and fuck shit up.”


	“I hope 45 goes to war if he doesn't I will,” Rogers texted five days later.


	“I'm with you,” Copeland replied.


	At some point, a person who is not named in court documents told law enforcement that Rogers was stockpiling weapons, including illegal machine guns. 


	“On Jan. 15, 2021,” Rogers told me, “I was arrested and my life ruined.” He went on, “I got railroaded plain and simple.”


	WHEN ROGERS WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY, he was cuffed in front, and wearing a denim jacket over a camouflage tank top. Police walked him into an interrogation room, where his conversation with two officers was relaxed and polite. Rogers answered questions about his firearms. “I have a lot of guns so I kind of lose track,” he said early on. “I've always been a gun nut.” He explained that he made pipe bombs because he enjoyed “blowing stuff up” on camping trips. He referred to himself as a “prepper,” and described his reverence for the military. Rogers said he did not want to be caught off guard in the event that “crap ever hit the fan,” and if it ever did, he kept a “bugout bag” and bulletproof masks. “It's all on the internet,” he said. “Military stuff is cool because you get really high quality for cheap.”


	Rogers approached the subject of his Three Percenter group with a sense of irony. He seemed to suggest an awareness that he was involved in a charade, such as when the Three Percenters gathered online after Jan. 6 and reminded each other to “say something if you hear something.” A “something,” he said, might include the deployment of the National Guard to Sacramento, or the imposition of martial law. “A lot of these guys are just, like, dreaming,” Rogers said, laughing. “We don't really do much.”

	











	Still, Rogers was confident in his assessment that a conspiracy was afoot. He said the riot at the Capitol was “obviously staged.” He allowed that there were “probably some Trump supporters,” but, he said, “I think there was probably a lot of undercover antifa people.” And even if there weren't, Rogers insisted, “People have stormed the Capitol building numerous times over the last couple years.”


	Rogers' certainty was rather striking, since the Capitol had not been “stormed” in recent years, and that Jan. 6 — its scale, its brutality, its intent to thwart the passage of power — was a singular event in American history. In fact, the last time the Capitol had been stormed was by the British, during the War of 1812.


	Rogers spoke openly during the interview, as if he had little doubt that he was on the right side of history. “There's a part of me that I wish we would overthrow these Democrats,” Rogers said. “It's just, to me, there's so many forces against this nation now. What can one or two guys do? Now maybe if all those guys that stormed the Capitol last week had firearms, maybe they could change things, you know? 'Cause that's what the Second Amendment's about.” Rogers rested his head against the wall. “This country,” he said, “is over with, at least the way I grew up it is.” One of the officers asked Rogers if he had planned on hurting anyone, and he replied, “I thought about it,” adding, “I've thought about fighting against — fighting back against the government. But like I said, it's always when I'm inebriated. You wake up and you go, ‘That's not a good idea.'” Rogers went on, “I don't want to hurt anybody, you know? I mean, maybe if you could attack the right people.” He laughed in amusement. “But you don't want to hurt an innocent person. Like people that are really causing problems in this world, like George Soros, you know? It's kind of satisfying thinking about hurting some scumbag like that. Just because the guy causes so much chaos and misery.”


	As the interrogation proceeded, it became apparent that it had never occurred to Rogers that he might be wrong about anything. He was supremely self-assured, unconcerned that he had perhaps been misled and as a result broke the law. Rogers had acknowledged that the Three Percenter activities were a kind of role-playing exercise, but he was also a true believer, and for that reason he struggled to understand that he could be in real trouble, until he was finally told otherwise. Rogers asked, “What's gonna happen to me?” and when an officer told him he was getting booked at the jail, Rogers, uncomprehending, said, “For what?” The officer referred to his illegal weapons, the possession of which constituted a felony. “Jeez,” Rogers replied.

	











	THE LETTERS WRITTEN BY ROGERS' family members to the judge after he pleaded guilty were telling, especially one written by his sister Heather. She explained her brother's downfall the way others might explain a person's decision to join ISIS. “He was a hardworking blue-collar businessman who created his own financial prosperity and security from our lower middle-class upbringing,” she wrote. “It's this exact type of person the right-wing news programs and extremist groups prey upon to radicalize.” She called him “a victim himself of these extremist groups recruiting in every corner of the internet.”


	Rogers, of course, does not view himself this way; that kind of reinterpretation would be extraordinarily unlikely. The gun industry sells firearm ownership as a political statement against the notion of victimhood, and as a masculine assertion of self-reliance. In this framing, Rogers cannot be susceptible to exploitation without shattering his self-conception, but he can be a casualty of a government that is opposed to freedom. 


	It is not clear whether Jarrod Copeland's perspective still aligns with that of Rogers, since Copeland did not respond to a request for comment. After pleading to an obstruction charge and his role as his friend's co-conspirator, Copeland received a five-year sentence and was released in May. Rogers, who was sentenced to more time because of his weapons violations, is now pursuing a commutation from President Trump. “I am seeking clemency because I feel I was targeted by the authorities because I am a conservative Republican,” he wrote in his application. “I am a white, Christian, conservative male who proudly was not shy about my beliefs, and I was targeted because of this.”

	Trump's blanket pardons for Jan. 6 rioters — an official sanctioning of partisan political violence — gives Rogers hope, four years into his confinement, that he'll get out of prison early and restart his life with a clean record. If a pardon comes through, he'd again be legally allowed to own guns. How he would live is an open question. Yuliia has divorced him, and he remains consumed by conspiratorial thoughts. He believes the gun industry, the NRA, the Second Amendment, and Trump stand between America and its ruination. The Democratic Party is waiting in the weeds, preparing to pounce, and impose its will.

He says he's been sober since the day he was arrested, and his attachment to his son appears genuine. Whether that will be enough, when he's released, to restrain his darkest impulses is a test he will have to face again and again. For now, as before, Rogers gives the world his word — he would never harm another person.

Iran still has the components needed to build a nuclear weapon after President Donald Trump ordered airstrikes on its nuclear sites, even as military hardliners dissatisfied with the weakness shown by their country's clerical leadership are poised to gain greater control, multiple sources tell Rolling Stone.


	Trump has insisted America's strikes on Iran's nuclear sites caused “total obliteration,” and has attacked the media for questioning this narrative after a leaked report from the Defense Intelligence Agency contradicted the administration's claims.


	Given outstanding questions about covert aspects of Iran's nuclear program, there are few definitive claims to be made about a timeline for Iran to build a bomb — or whether it will now decide to do so.


	However, the attacks by Israel and the U.S. initiated an ideological realignment within the Iranian government, known as “the System” in Persian. Most critically, the elites advocating a policy of “strategic patience” — a key component of which was forsaking a nuclear weapons program to avoid direct confrontation with the West — have now been discredited.

	“The hardliners in the System may be on the ascendancy, because many of their critiques of efforts at diplomacy and a negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue were basically confirmed,” says Nicole Grajewski, a fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, with expertise in Iran. “The System is under pressure and extreme constraints now that it is militarily weakened — not to mention Israel's proven ability to dominate their airspace. It may not be the end of strategic patience, but a transition towards a much more paranoid, hardline, and secretive political space.” 

	











	“There's a limit to what Israel and the United States know about what actually happened with their strikes,” says Ali Vaez, the Iran program director at the International Crisis Group. “It has become a much more complicated crisis. It's certainly not resolved at all.”

	There's little sign any of the belligerents agree about what they want to happen next. Israel, which says the primary goal of its attack was to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, had also encouraged Iranians to overthrow their government. Trump, too, floated “regime change” as the ultimate solution to the crisis — as did GOP hawks — but now his administration says it hopes to return to negotiations.


	Creating a nuclear weapon requires access to uranium; the ability to mine and process the metal ore into a gaseous state; construction and operation of centrifuges to enrich the radioactive material to a high grade of purity; and the technical expertise to construct a device.


	Fissile material for civil use is enriched to a low grade — around five percent purity — while weaponized applications require highly enriched uranium, as pure as 90 percent or more.


	“I'm not quite sure how well designed the strikes themselves were, to completely knock out the elements of Iran's capacity to build a device with weapons-grade uranium relatively quickly,” says Farzan Sabet, a researcher focused on the Middle East at the Global Governance Center, who runs the blog Iran Wonk. “Color me a little bit skeptical until we have more data.”


	The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which oversees compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), released a report on May 31 that noted Iran was stockpiling highly enriched uranium and conducting other “illicit” activities.


	“Iran can convert its current stock of 60 percent enriched uranium into 233 kilograms [513 pounds] of WGU [weapon-grade uranium] in three weeks at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, enough for nine nuclear weapons,” wrote analysts at the Institute for Science and International Security, a think tank specializing in non-proliferation, in their analysis of the IAEA's report.

	Findings like that formed the basis for claims that Iran was close to getting a nuclear weapon, but whether it was trying to do so is as much a question of political intent as physical capabilities.


	Neither Israeli nor U.S. officials provided any direct evidence that Iran had begun building a bomb since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, touching off Israel's current confrontation with Iran. Indeed, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said in March that U.S. intelligence “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003.” 

	











	Amid criticism from Trump and MAGA loyalists, she has since reversed her public stance, posting on X recently that “Iran is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly.”


	Prior to the strikes, a robust monitoring and inspection regimen was essential to keeping tabs on Iran's nuclear program, and analysts at the Institute for Science and International Security asserted that moving forward: “The urgent need is to place IAEA inspections at the heart of relations with Iran and reaffirm that Iran will never be allowed to get a nuclear weapon.”


	Iranian officials have now threatened to expel IAEA inspectors. Whether this is intended as leverage during potential future negotiations is unclear, but if the IAEA is kicked out, the international community loses visibility about Iran's nuclear program — even as internal pressure to “break out” and make a dash to build a weapon becomes critical.


	IAEA officials have said Iran has 900 pounds of highly enriched uranium, and analysts spoken to by Rolling Stone believe at least some of this was dispersed from Fordow prior to American strikes, but acknowledge lacking any specific details.


	“We do not have information of the whereabouts of this material,” IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi told an interviewer last week. “Iran officially told me ‘We are going to be taking protective measures,' which may or may not include moving around this material.”


	There are also outstanding questions about Iran's existing enrichment centrifuges. In 2018, Trump withdrew from former President Barack Obama's 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. The treaty, called the “Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,” or JCPOA, was intended to curb Iran's nuclear program.


	The JCPOA placed limits on the number of centrifuges Iran was allowed to operate, allowed the IAEA to verify compliance under the NPT. In the wake of the U.S. withdrawal from the plan — which was signed by all five UN Security Council members, as well as the EU — Iran maintained compliance, until a succession of Israeli attacks in 2020 and 2021 on a centrifuge manufacturing site. Tehran then prevented the IAEA from monitoring at that site.


	As a result, “we knew that they had produced hundreds of advanced centrifuges. We just didn't know where they were,” Vaez says.


	In a post-attack analysis published on Tuesday, the Institute for Science and International Security asserted that “Overall, Israel's and U.S. attacks have effectively destroyed Iran's centrifuge enrichment program.” But it also noted: “That being said, there are residuals such as stocks of 60 percent, 20 percent, and three to five percent enriched uranium and the centrifuges manufactured but not yet installed at Natanz or Fordow. These non-destroyed parts pose a threat as they can be used in the future to produce weapon-grade uranium.”

	











	It's unlikely that U.S. and Israeli military operations have fully accounted for all of these centrifuges. Despite whatever level of destruction was achieved at the Fordow enrichment site, there remain uranium hexafluoride production and enrichment facilities at the complexes in Natanz and Isfahan, which were largely untouched.


	“You cannot ‘obliterate' a program if you still have both centrifuges and enriched uranium up to the 60 percent level that still exists,” Sen. Chris Murphy told reporters last Thursday, after receiving a classified briefing about the strikes.


	Vaez observes that if Iran is committed to building a nuclear bomb, the barrier might not be as high as some policymakers assert. “A few dozen advanced centrifuges could fit in a relatively small room and would have no detectable footprint, and could be used in order to enrich up to 90 percent, if you have the 60 percent stockpile as feed,” he says.


	“With their 60-percent stockpile, they can get enough fissile material for a single nuclear weapon in six days, and they can have enough for an arsenal worth in less than a month,” Vaez tells Rolling Stone.


	But whether or not Iran retains the materials needed to create a nuclear weapon, it doesn't necessarily mean it has decided to do so — and there is a substantial difference between building a single functioning device, and creating multiple weaponized nuclear warheads needed to create a credible deterrent.


	“I'm not sure if they have a game plan about how they're going to conduct diplomacy,” Sabet says. “I'm not sure if they have a game plan about the end state they want, and the concessions they're willing to make.”


	“The bottom line conclusion here is that Iran's nuclear weapons capacity has been reduced. But its intent to acquire nuclear weapons has increased,” Vaez says.


	Whether its intent has increased or not, certainly there was no regime change. In the wake of the U.S. and Israeli attacks, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) — the military branch charged with the protection of Iran's government — has tightened its grip over the country. IRGC militias have set up surprise checkpoints, are searching people's phones for incriminating information, are conducting mass arrests, and have carried out multiple executions.


	Iranians largely rallied around the flag despite widespread discontent with the System, which proved its resilience by continuing to function despite Israel's attacks on its leadership.

	











	That was by design. After the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the IRGC instituted the “Mosaic Doctrine,” designed to ensure the survivability of the regime.


	“The idea of the Mosaic Doctrine was based on the threat of an invasion — an Iraq-style invasion and occupation by the United States, which was what they were expecting,” Sabet says. “They understood that the leadership could be decapitated either through assassination or precision strikes.”


	This, Sabet says, “created the capacity for IRGC regional and provincial headquarters to assume responsibility for local security, either in the case of a domestic emergency, or in the case of a foreign hostile threat.”


	Israel killed top IRGC commanders when its Operation Rising Lion began in mid-June. Many of these were veteran leaders fully invested in the strategic patience strategy — central to Iran's response after the U.S. assassinated an influential IRGC commander, Major General Qasem Soleimani, in 2020.


	“They wanted to take their time to think about what would look proportional, while preventing the need for President Trump, in his first term, to retaliate,” Sabet says. A week after Soleimani's assassination, Iran carried out limited strikes on American facilities in Iraq, telegraphed well in advance.


	Iran's response last Monday to the U.S. strikes echoed the 2020 dynamic. Tehran launched six short-range ballistic missiles against the U.S. airbase at al-Udeid in Doha, Qatar — all of which were shot down by Patriot air defense batteries.


	Surreally, Trump actually thanked the Iranians for conducting the counterstrike in such a manner. “I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost and nobody to be injured,” Trump wrote on social media.


	Indeed, social media has been a key front in this conflict, and modern militaries are becoming more sophisticated about how they engage with it, says Matthew Ford, the author of War in the Smartphone Age, and a professor of War Studies at the Swedish Defense University in Stockholm. Ford notes in particular Israel's online showcasing of its intelligence and military prowess during Operation Rising Lion. Indeed, as Rolling Stone has reported, Trump appears to have changed his mind about becoming involved in the conflict after seeing how Israel's operation was playing out on Fox News.


	Governments seek to impose a top-down information strategy in an effort to control the narrative, but this is increasingly difficult in the era of “participatory media,” Ford says. Both Israel and Iran took steps to limit information — with Israel imposing a media clampdown in reporting on ballistic missile strikes and seeding memes about its operations across social media, while Iran simply cut off internet access for much of its population.

	











	The United States also used deception aimed at online audiences. After a Trump spokesperson said he would take action “within two weeks,” keen-eyed observers breathlessly tracked groups of U.S. B-2 Spirit stealth bombers and refueling aircraft online, using publicly available flight data to follow them moving west, apparently on their way to Guam. In the meantime, the actual strike aircraft were heading east unnoticed, without broadcasting their flight information, and bombed Iran's nuclear sites while the decoy group was still over the Pacific.


	“There is a moment where what is happening online can have meaningful kinetic effects on the ground,” Ford observes.


	Chatter online and on TV is also central to managing the domestic political response. Amid a fierce debate inside the MAGA coalition about the wisdom of direct action against Iran, the Trump administration has become hypersensitive about the media's reporting on the strikes.


	“Time and time again, classified information is leaked or peddled for political purposes to try to make the president look bad, and what's really happening is you're undermining the success of our incredible pilots,” said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in a press briefing at the Pentagon last Thursday.

	While a ‘If you don't trust us, it's because you hate the troops' strategy may play well with the self-licking Rocket Pop that is America's right-wing news ecosystem, it has little bearing on the situation on the ground. Even if the White House wins a public debate despite painting itself into a corner with its claim of “total obliteration” at the Fordow enrichment site, it ultimately obscures the bigger question: Will the attacks help convince Iran to forsake nuclear weapons?


	That question will not be answered in a press conference, or in a social media post.

PEMBROKE:  A Massachusetts woman experienced a surprising event when she came across a mysterious viral object in the sky and recorded the situation on video. 

Colleen McCormack, resident of Pembroke, was having a relaxed time in her outdoor hot tub around 9 pm on Wednesday when she observed an unusual sight above her. “I was in the hot tub, looked up at the sky, and saw something small floating. I thought, ‘What is that?'” Colleen McCormack said in an interview with WHDH-TV. She promptly recorded the scene on her phone.



The footage exposes what appears to be a glowing object descending rapidly. “It looked as though it was on fire or something, and it was just coming down very quickly,” she described in an interview with WFXT-TV. “I have no idea what it could have been.”

Despite the spectacular visuals, the event was notably silent. “It was quiet. You couldn't hear anything, which only added to my confusion,” McCormack remarked. “Typically, when objects fly overhead, you can hear them.”

The unidentified viral object remains a mystery, as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed that there were no reports of debris or incidents involving aircraft in the vicinity and refrained from commenting on the video evidence.

Local police and fire departments also indicated they had received no related calls or sightings.

McCormack, still feeling unsettled by the incident, stated, “My heart was racing because I just looked up and thought, ‘Oh my God, what is about to happen?'”

This UFO sighting in Massachusetts has generated considerable interest online, with various theories ranging from meteor fragments to experimental aircraft. However, in the absence of official clarification, the nature of the mystery object remains an unresolved mystery

In 1950, a McMinnville-area farmer took two photos of a UFO. LC- Paul Trent

National UFO Day is July 2 — and if you're in Oregon, you have a higher-than-average chance of spotting something strange in the sky.

Oregon is the No. 4 state for UFO sightings, according to a study produced by casino.ca. While perhaps a casino website isn't the world's foremost expert on mysterious objects in the sky, the data for the study came from the National UFO Reporting Center. The casino.ca researchers combined that data “with scraping social media for sighting details” and “worked out the UFO sightings per capita for both U.S. and Canada.”

Anyone who lives in the Pacific Northwest is unlikely to be surprised by the results.

The West Coast collectively accounts for the most UFO sightings in the country.

California is the No. 1 state for UFO sightings, according to the report. Washington state is No. 2.

That's not too surprising, considering that the first modern UFO sighting was reported by a pilot flying above Washington in 1947.

Oregon is also home to the world's second largest UFO festival. The annual McMinnville UFO Festival celebrates a famous 1950 sighting in the Oregon town.

Photos of the McMinnville UFO, taken by local farmers Evelyn and Paul Trent, were investigated by the Air Force and dubbed “difficult to explain in a conventional way.”

Paul Trent and his wife, Evelyn, took two UFO photos outside their McMinnville home in 1950. The pictures ran in The Oregonian one month later.The Oregonian archive

In December 2024, a mass UFO sighting was reported, with multiple pilots seeing mysterious red lights in the skies over Oregon. 

While some experts believed that those lights were most likely Starlink satellites, which have caused UFO panics in recent years, others disagreed.

Tim Gallaudet, an oceanographer and retired rear admiral in the U.S. Navy, said in 2024, “Most pilots who see Starlink, they know they're seeing Starlink.”

You fit right in.

Whatever it takes, that's alright. It's human nature to change your mind and be one with the group. To relax your presence to maintain good will. To stay quiet and under the radar — but be careful. As in the new book, “The Ghosts of Gwendolyn Montgomery” by Clarence A. Haynes, denying who you really are can be deadly.

Beautiful, talented, and driven, Gwendolyn Montgomery's touch was magic. Everyone who wanted to be famous knew that she alone could make it happen, that her work at Sublime Creative could make someone a legend like Gwendolyn herself.

Yes, she was a superstar.

Personally, though, things were different. Working long hours with whiny, demanding stars was fine, but Gwendolyn wanted companionship. She was lucky she met James, who was sweet and kinda geeky, not perfect, but better than another one-night stand.

And there was that other problem: someone or some thing was trying to ruin Gwendolyn's career.

It was horrible when a fashion show she'd organized at the Brooklyn Museum was trashed by a red substance that the police said was blood. It was terrible when the same thing happened at an event she'd done for her baddest, most spoiled client. But the gory Spanish words scrawled on the wall of both venues were what scared her the most.

“TRAIDORA,” they said. Traitor.

Ever since he was a teenager, Fonsi Harewood talked to ghosts; recently, he learned that he could sleep with one, too. That super-hot incubus was literally only the man of Fonsi's dreams, though, and so Fonsi renounced love and threw himself into being a part-time psychic and running La Playa, a store for believers in the spiritual.

He loved that store and his customers but lately, he'd noticed that something was wrong and his BFF's mother, Estelle, also a psychic, confirmed it. El Intermedio, the spirit world, was roiling and they needed someone with more power to help hold the spirits back.

Someone like Fonsi's long-estranged cousin, also a Guardián, wherever she was…

If you're like a lot of people, you pick up a book, skim the first few pages, and make your decision: to read or not to read. Do that with the beginning of “The Ghosts of Gwendolyn Montgomery” and you'll be tempted to put it back.

Trust this, though: despite that it's a jumble at first, you won't be sorry if you stay.

Whether you believe in ghosts or you scoff at the idea of a spirit world, this novel will satisfy your cravings with lots of hair-raising moments and one or two moderately-explicit eyebrow-raisers, along with an intriguing back-story that includes a bit of mystery. But it's not all boo-who: author Clarence A. Haynes injects enough excitement and humor to keep even the most sober-minded reader entranced with a plot that's twisty fun.

For your vacation this year, you know you're going to want to take a good book along and you can't go wrong with “The Ghosts of Gwendolyn Montgomery.”

Check your suitcase. It'll fit right in.

Bloody Disgusting's parent company Cineverse has acquired A Useful Ghost with plans for a theatrical release.

The Thai supernatural dark comedy won the Critics' Week Grand Prize at Cannes.

Writer-director Ratchapoom Boonbunchachoke makes his feature debut on the international co-production between Thailand, France, Singapore, and Germany.

March is mourning his wife Nat who has recently passed away due to dust pollution. He discovers her spirit has returned by possessing the vacuum cleaner. Being disturbed by a ghost that appeared after a worker's death shut down their factory, his family reject the unconventional human-ghost relationship.

Trying to convince them of their love, Nat offers to cleanse the factory. To become a useful ghost, she must first get rid of the useless ones.

Davika Hoorne (Pee Mak) and Witsarut Himmarat star with Apasiri Nitibhon, Wanlop Rungkumjad, and Wisarut Homhuan.

“What makes A Useful Ghost such a singular thrill isn't just its wickedly inventive premise, but the remarkable control and tonal dexterity with which Ratchapoom Boonbunchachoke — astonishingly, in his feature debut — brings it to life,” says Eric Rowe, Executive Director of Programming at Cineverse.

“With rare wit and emotional clarity, Boonbunchachoke crafts a sharp, blackly comic satire that repurposes the ghost story trope into a playful yet pointed meditation on love, labor, and the absurdity of never being allowed to rest.”

The producers of the film added: “We are delighted to entrust U.S. and Canadian distribution to a company with Cineverse's scale and reputation. We are confident that Cineverse is the ideal partner to amplify the film's overwhelmingly positive reception from the Western press — particularly in the United States — and to build on that momentum by introducing the film to North American audiences in a way that celebrates its critical acclaim and ensures its artistic and cultural impact resonates widely.”

Cineverse's upcoming theatrical slate includes The Toxic Avenger on August 29, Silent Night, Deadly Night on December 12, Return to Silent Hill on January 23, 2026, and Wolf Creek: Legacy in Fall 2026.

Its creation has raised over $5,000 for the US Alzheimer's Association

A new Fallout 4 mod put together over the course of a 40 hour-long charity modathon will see you beamed up by aliens you're investigating on behalf of a quirky conspiracy theorist. Its creation alone has raised over $5,800 (about £4.2k) for the American Alzheimer's Association so far.

We wrote about the plans to livestream this mod's creation last month. The team behind Fallout 4's popular Sim Settlements mod are behind it, having teamed up with Wes 'Sheogorath' Johnson, a number of other voice actors and a group of prominent Fallout modders to make a cool thing with a bunch of moving parts in one weekend.

Their creation, Transmission Zeta, is now available to download via Nexus Mods. It looks like a fun time, though you might not dig the questline it offers if you're not down for plenty of silliness and Fallouty meta humour.

In line with what viewers voted for during a June 14th planning stream, that questline is all about aliens. The Zetans from the Fallout 3 Mothership Zeta DLC have returned to The Commonwealth to get up to some abduction antics, along with various other cameos from across the Fallout series. You'll investigate with the aid of Clark, a zany conspiracy theorist voiced by Johnson, and the mod's fully-voiced follower, a vault dwelling con artist called Arlen.

The 40 hour Modathon is over, and you raised just shy of 10k across our events - and there's still one more to go!Amazing work from all the modders who poured themselves into this!Join @GopherGaming and @WesJohnsonVoice tomorrow to watch the reveal of what we've assembled! pic.twitter.com/c7CsW4Xb63

As you play through the quests and explore a new dungeon, one of which is called ""V.A.T.S in Spaaace!"", you'll gain some custom alien-themed weapons and armour made by modders Neeher and Niero. There's also a player home in the form of a houseboat with its own robot butler that modder Elianora's cooked up.

In order to start the mod's questline once it's installed, the modders write that you'll need to ""simply pass through any load screen by fast traveling or entering and exiting a building"", at which point a strange new radio station will pop up on your Pip-Boy. If you're not in the mood for modding or just want to get a taste of what you're in for, YouTuber Gopher has livestreamed a playthrough of Transmission Zeta as part of the modathon.

If you are planning on playing the mod, you'll need version 1.10.163.0 or greater of Fallout 4 and all of its DLC aside from Far Harbor and the high-res texture pack.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to investigate this weird blue light that's just begun beaming down from the heavens outside my house.

Colorado Representative Lauren Boebert isn't going to turn down a chance to do the conspiracy thing, even if she probably thinks it's all an inside joke. Right-wing media love conspiracies because they tend to be a fairly fact-free preoccupation, where politics can easily be grafted onto a story without having to endure any real scrutiny. Boebert recently hit the airwaves to complete a trifecta of conspiracy mongering, touching on faked nuclear-weapons tests, the staged Moon landing in 1969, and a building collapse during the 9/11 attacks.

Boebert appeared on ""Prime Time with Alex Stein,"" which, as MTN/Meidas News points out, is broadcast on Glenn Beck's right-friendly Blaze TV. Stein was rabble-rousing and teeing up the conspiracies like big old nutty softballs, and to her credit Boebert was giggling and messing with her hair the whole time, suggesting an ad hoc pact to spend the segment enthusiastically trolling the libs.

Still, the discussion was a masterclass in re-seeding conspiracy narratives in a way that serve the entertain-at-all-costs mandate of right-wing media while also reinforcing the familiar line that the government cannot be trusted.



In 2023, Joe Rogan and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen delved into a layered conspiracy theory about U.S. nuclear tests being faked. I say ""layered"" because Andreessen suggested that they were faked to intimidate the Russians – it was a clever psyop. Nothing was actually decimated by the blasts, and the survival of the footage is proof. How did the cameras keep running? How was the film not torched?

Boebert went with the flow on this one and then started babbling about submarines. Of course, it's not difficult to find out why the cameras survived – they were elaborately shielded. What was interesting about the exchange between Boebert and Stein was that while Stein was clearly just screwing around, Boebert had to play along with the conspiracy theory while simultaneously defending the Pentagon's decision to bomb Iran's totally, completely real nukes program. Awkward!

But why stop with debunked tales about phony nukes? Let's go for some bigger fish: next up, the bogus Moon landing!



The idea that the Moon landing was a hoax has been built from many pieces, and one that has some basis in fact is the allegation that the Van Allen radiation belts that surround Earth would have killed the Apollo 11 astronauts before they completed their journey. There were six ""successful"" crewed Moon landings, so they must all have been staged! But the Van Allen conspiracy angle isn't hard to dismiss – due to mission planning and spacecraft shielding, NASA ensured that the astronauts absorbed little more than a medical x-ray's worth of radiation.

Boebert and Stein topped it off with Tucker Carlson's bolstering of the theory that so-called ""Building 7"" at the World Trade Center must have collapsed as a result of a controlled demolition because it wasn't struck by a jet airliner on 9/11. It actually caught on fire and collapsed as a consequence of some thoroughly understandable structural failures.

Conspiracy theories put Boebert in a good mood, and why wouldn't they? The stories are always better than what really happened, and they are incredibly politically malleable. I can remember a time when the notion that the Moon landing was faked appealed more to radical leftists, post-Watergate, than hardcore right-wingers in the pre-Reagan years. Shockingly, Boebert and Stein failed to indulge in some comedy around the granddaddy of them all; somehow, the JFK assassination didn't come up.","{'href': 'https://www.jalopnik.com', 'title': 'Jalopnik'}","other"

Veteran American rapper Snoop Dogg has slammed Pavel Durov for fathering more than 100 children, claiming that the Telegram founder and CEO was “dropping litters” rather than making babies.

Durov told French newspaper Le Point last month that he is the official father of six children with three different partners, but that he also has over 100 other kids in 12 countries through sperm donations.

Snoop Dogg, himself a father of four, addressed the Telegram CEO in a post on X on Monday, writing: “Yo, Pave Durov, heard U got 106 kids now??”

“Neffew you not havn babies you droppn litters... slo down,” the musician advised, including a cat and dog emojis and the #PuppyLove hashtag in his post.

@snoopdogg takes a dogg to know a dogg, I can give you some tips 😉 best discussed where privacy is king. I'll hit you on TG.

Durov replied a few hours later, writing that it “takes a dogg to know a dogg, I can give you some tips.”

However, the tech billionaire suggested that X, which is owned by Elon Musk, was not the proper platform to address the topic.

“Best discussed where privacy is king. I'll hit you on TG [Telegram],” he told Snoop.

In the same interview with Le Point in mid-June, Durov announced that he plans to leave his fortune to his numerous children. However, the 40-year-old clarified that they will not have access to their inheritance until 30 years from now.

Forbes estimates the wealth of the Russian-born Telegram CEO at $17.1 billion, making him the 134th richest person in the world.

Lead of Chrisley Knows Best said he didn't ‘have an apology to give' in interview after release from prison

A reality TV star who was imprisoned for defrauding banks of tens of millions of dollars before being pardoned in May by Donald Trump says there is nothing for him to be sorry about.

“I don't have an apology to give you or anyone else over the money that I've made,” Todd Chrisley said in an interview with ABC News that was posted online on Monday.

Speaking to the network alongside his wife, Julie, who was also imprisoned and then pardoned by the president, Chrisley's comments were some of his most extensive comments yet about his and his spouse's abbreviated experiences behind bars.

He joked that his first post-pardon shower back home was as exciting as his “first sexual encounter”. And, as his family begins planning to return to television with a new reality show on Lifetime, he said “it doesn't matter what someone else's opinion” of him is.

“No one's opinion of me has ever caused me to question who I am at the core,” the former co-star of Chrisley Knows Best said to ABC News. “So I don't worry about someone else's opinion.”

Chrisley Knows Best aired on USA Network from 2014 to 2023, depicting Todd as a wealthy real estate developer and entrepreneur who was raising a family with Julie in their suburban Atlanta mansion.

But in 2019, during Trump's first presidency, the federal government charged the Chrisleys with tax evasion and bank fraud. Jurors in 2022 convicted the couple of defrauding banks of at least $30m, leaving Todd to be sentenced to 12 years in prison and Julie to seven years.

The couple's daughter Savannah Chrisley was a vocal Trump advocate as he successfully ran for a second presidency in November 2024. Trump then pardoned Todd and Julie on 27 May, a little more than four months after he was sworn back into the Oval Office.

Trump personally called Savannah to inform her of her parents' pardons, according to a White House video.

The Chrisleys' pardons freed them from prison after serving less than three years. Their pardons came amid a series of clemencies that Trump gave to supporters in what evidently was a broader rebuke against a justice system that had convicted him of criminally falsifying business records months before he retook the White House.

Some particularly criticized the Chrisleys' pardons because an appeals court had upheld their jury convictions.

Nonetheless, as ABC News noted, Todd argued that the makeup of the couple's jury was questionable and the president was right to pardon him and Julie.

Julie recounted to the network that she had made some everlasting friendships while incarcerated. “I have met some amazing women … that I will be friends with till the day that I die,” she told ABC.

Yet, unsurprisingly, Todd said he and his wife were relieved to be out of prison early as they weigh whether to move to South Carolina and film themselves converting a mansion into a hotel.

“You don't realize how much your freedom means to you until you don't have it,” he remarked.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Follow:


            A federal judge has ruled that recent mass layoffs at the US Department of Health and Human Services were likely unlawful and ordered the Trump administration to halt plans to downsize and reorganize the nation's health workforce.
    


            US District Judge Melissa DuBose granted the preliminary injunction sought by a coalition of attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit filed in early May.
    


            DuBose said the states had shown “irreparable harm,” from the cuts and were likely to prevail in their claims that “HHS's action was both arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary to law.”
    


            “The executive branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,” DuBose wrote in a 58-page order handed down in US District Court in Providence, Rhode Island, on Tuesday.
    


            Her order blocks the Trump administration from finalizing layoffs announced in March or issuing any further firings. HHS is directed to file a status report by July 11.
    


            The ruling applies to terminated employees in four divisions of HHS: the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Center for Tobacco Products within the Food and Drug Administration; the Office of Head Start within the Administration for Children and Families and employees of regional offices who work on Head Start matters; and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.
    


Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. eliminated more than 10,000 employees in late March and consolidated 28 agencies to 15. Since then, agencies including the CDC have repeatedly rescinded layoffs affecting hundreds of employees, including in branches that monitor HIV, hepatitis and other diseases.
    


            The attorneys general argued that the massive restructuring was arbitrary and outside of the scope of the agency's authority. The lawsuit also says that the action decimated essential programs and pushed burdensome costs onto states.
    


            “The intended effect … was the wholesale elimination of many HHS programs that are critical to public health and safety,” the lawsuit argued.
    


            The cuts are part of a federal “Make America Healthy Again” directive to streamline costly agencies and reduce redundancies. Kennedy told senators at a May 14 hearing that there is “so much chaos and disorganization” at HHS.
    


            But the restructuring had eliminated key teams that regulate food safety and drugs, as well as support a wide range of programs for tobacco, HIV prevention and maternal and infant health. Kennedy has since said that because of mistakes, 20% of people fired might be reinstated.
    


            The states who joined the lawsuit have Democratic governors, and many of the same states — plus a few others — also sued the Trump administration over $11 billion in cuts to public health funding. A preliminary injunction was granted in that case in mid-May.

            The US Senate has voted nearly unanimously to remove a 10-year moratorium on the enforcement of state artificial intelligence regulations from Republicans' sweeping domestic policy bill.
    


            The provision in the Senate bill would have effectively prevented states from enforcing many proposed and existing AI-related laws — including regulations around sexually explicit and political deepfakes — for the next decade. Earlier this month, Senate Commerce Committee Republicans had moved to tie compliance with the moratorium to crucial federal funds for deploying internet infrastructure.
    


            While some tech leaders have advocated for a single federal law rather than a patchwork of state regulations, the moratorium had raised alarms among other tech workers and leaders, academics, advocacy groups, state regulators and lawmakers. Opponents of the provision worried that it could hamstring efforts to hold tech companies accountable for potential harms to society, especially in light of the fact that there is currently no comprehensive federal legislation regulating AI.
    


            On Monday night, the Senate voted 99-1 in favor of an amendment to strike the provision from the bill. The amendment was co-sponsored by Sens. Ed Markey, Maria Cantwell and Marsha Blackburn.

            “This 99-1 vote sent a clear message that Congress will not sell out our kids and local communities in order to pad the pockets of Big Tech billionaires,” Markey said in a statement, adding, “I look forward to working with my colleagues to develop responsible guardrails for AI.”
    


            The vote came during the Senate's marathon “vote-a-rama” on various amendments to the agenda bill. Republicans have been aiming to have the bill on President Donald Trump's desk by July 4, but the legislation must still go back to the House if it passes the Senate.
    


            At least one House lawmaker, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, had warned that she would vote “no” on the agenda bill if the Senate did not remove the AI moratorium provision.
    


            Opponents of the AI regulation moratorium cheered the Senate vote on Tuesday.
    


            “State legislatures all across the country have done critical bipartisan work to protect the American people from some of the most dangerous harms of AI technology,” Ilana Beller, democracy organizing manager at the progressive consumer advocacy group Public Citizen said in a statement. “The defeat of this moratorium will mean vital protections remain in place for millions of Americans.”

US President Donald Trump has said that he might entertain the idea of deporting Elon Musk and could consider getting the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to look into the billionaire's government contracts.

The president's comments come amid a very public falling out between him and Musk, who was until recently one of Trump's staunchest supporters. Last month, Musk stepped down as the head of DOGE after heavily criticizing Trump's “big, beautiful” budget bill, which includes a $5 trillion debt ceiling increase.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump was asked if he would look at deporting Elon Musk – a naturalized US citizen – to his native South Africa, to which the president replied: “I don't know, we'll have to take a look.”

“We might have to put DOGE on Elon,” the president added, noting that “DOGE is the monster that might have to go back and eat Elon.” Trump further pointed out that Musk had been getting a “lot of subsidies.” 

“Elon's very upset that the [Electrical Vehicle] mandate is going to be terminated,” Trump said, stating that “not everybody wants an electric car.”

Earlier, Trump also posted on his Truth Social platform that Musk “knew, long before he so strongly endorsed me for president, that I was strongly against the EV Mandate.” The president said that electric cars are “fine” but objected to having everyone forced to own one.

Trump suggested in his post that without subsidies, Musk could end up having to “close up shop and head back home to South Africa.” This, according to Trump, could save the US “a fortune,” as Musk would no longer be engaged in any rocket launches, satellites, or electric car production.

”Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!” Trump wrote.

Meanwhile, Musk has continued to attack Trump's budget bill, claiming that it undermines his work with DOGE to cut federal spending.

“Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame,” Musk wrote on X on Tuesday. “They will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth,” he warned.

Musk also reiterated calls to establish a new “America Party” to serve as an alternative to the “Democrat-Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a voice.”

BERLIN, 30 June. /TASS/. German top diplomat Johann Wadephul has arrived in Kiev on an unannounced visit, the German Foreign Ministry said.

According to the department, Wadephul assured upon his arrival that the German government would continue to ""fully focus on supporting Ukraine,"" including by providing ""modern air defenses and other weapons, as well as humanitarian and economic aid."" ""This is the promise upon which I am visiting Kiev today,"" he stated. Meanwhile, Wadephul also emphasized that Germany would continue to work on new anti-Russian sanctions together with its EU and G7 partners.

Germany is the second-largest arms supplier to Ukraine after the United States. Since the outset of the Ukrainian conflict, Germany has provided Kiev with various forms of assistance worth more than 40 billion euros. The Russian side has repeatedly stated that flooding the Kiev regime with weapons only prolongs the conflict.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Portugal and Spain suffer historic temperature highs for June, as French schools close because of heat 

Outdoor working has been banned during the hottest parts of the day in more than half of Italy's regions as an extreme heatwave that has smashed June temperature records in Spain and Portugal continues to grip large swathes of Europe.

The savage temperatures are believed to have claimed at least three lives, including that of a small boy who is thought to have died from heatstroke while in a car in Catalonia's Tarragona province on Tuesday afternoon.

In Palermo, Sicily, a 53-year-old woman died on Monday after fainting while walking along a street. She had reportedly suffered from a heart condition.

A 70-year-old man was reported to have drowned at a tourist resort close to Turin as intense heat gave way to storms and flash floods.

Admissions to hospital emergency units in parts of Italy have risen by 15-20% in recent days. The majority of patients are elderly people suffering from dehydration.

The heatwave, which has forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from their homes in Turkey due to wildfires, has also forced the closure of schools in parts of France – as education unions warned the classrooms were dangerously hot for children and teachers.

Tourists, meanwhile, were confronted with closures of some of Europe's popular attractions. The top of the Eiffel Tower was shut as temperatures in Paris were poised to hit 38C (100.4F). In Brussels, the Atomium monument, famed for its giant stainless steel balls, closed early as temperatures inched towards 37C.

In Italy, Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna, two industrial hubs, announced they were stopping open-air work between 12.30pm and 4pm, joining 11 other regions – stretching from Liguria in the north-west to Calabria and Sicily in the south – that have imposed similar bans in recent days.

Local authorities were heeding advice from trade unions after the death of Brahim Ait El Hajjam, a 47-year-old construction worker, who collapsed and died while working on a building site close to Bologna, the capital of Emilia-Romagna, on Monday.

Two workers fell ill on Tuesday on a construction site near Vicenza in Veneto. One is reportedly in a coma.

The CGIL Bologna and Fillea CGIL unions said in a statement: “While we wait to learn the actual cause of death, it is essential, during this terrible period, to promote a culture of safety.

“The climate emergency has clearly worsened the conditions for those who work outside every day and companies must give absolute priority to the protection of workers.”

The French national rail operator SNCF said train travel between France and Italy had been suspended for “at least several days” after violent storms on Monday, AFP reported.

Cogne, a town in Italy's Aosta Valley that suffered severe flooding in June last year, has been cut off by a landslide.

The Spanish state meteorological agency, Aemet, said in a social media update that “June 2025 smashed records” when it came to high temperature, with an average temperature of 23.6C, 0.8C above the previous hottest June in 2017.

The monthly average was also 3.5C higher than the average over the period from 1991 to 2020, it said.

The agency's comments come just days after Spain's highest ever June temperature of 46C was recorded in the Huelva province of Andalucía.

In Portugal, temperatures hit 46.6C in Mora, a town in the Évora district, in recent days, making it the highest June temperature ever recorded in the country, according to the Portuguese Institute for the Sea and Atmosphere.

In France, the prime minister, François Bayrou, tried to calm anger at the heatwave crisis in French schools. More than 1,896 schools across the country were fully or partially closed on Tuesday.

In Paris, which was on maximum heatwave alert, parents were advised to keep their children at home on Tuesday and Wednesday. Some other towns, including Troyes and Melun, closed all their schools.

Bayrou said the education ministry would open talks with mayors on how to adapt school buildings, most of which are extremely poorly insulated.

As temperatures rose on Tuesday, some Paris teachers had nothing more than a water spray on their desk to repeatedly spritz children in classrooms in the hope of keeping cool.

Bayrou, who is facing a vote of no confidence on Tuesday, which he is expected to survive, has cancelled his meetings to monitor the situation in real time.

The hot weather front known in Germany as Bettina is expected to have nearly the entire country in its grip by Wednesday, with temperatures shooting toward the 40C mark and only the coasts and Alpine peaks spared the scorching temperatures.

Industry groups warned that schools, elderly care homes and hospitals were ill-prepared for the heatwave – an urgent issue they said must be addressed as the frequency of life-threatening weather increases.

Other cities across Europe are also experiencing higher than usual temperatures, including Zaragoza (39C), Rome (37C), Madrid (37C), Athens (37C), Brussels (36C), Frankfurt (36C), Tirana (35C) and London (33C).

Turkey's forestry minister, İbrahim Yumaklı, said firefighters had been called out to 263 wildfires across the country in recent days. Firefighters have also been tackling wildfires in parts of France and Italy, especially on the islands of Sardinia and Sicily.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani takes selfies with supporters on Wednesday.Heather Khalifa/The Associated Press

Zohran Mamdani has won New York's Democratic mayoral primary, a new vote count confirmed Tuesday, cementing his stunning upset of former governor Andrew Cuomo and sending him to the general election.

The Associated Press called the race after the results of the city's ranked choice voting tabulation were released and showed Mamdani trouncing Cuomo by 12 percentage points.

In a statement, Mamdani said he was humbled by the support he received in the primary and started turning his attention to the general election.

“Last Tuesday, Democrats spoke in a clear voice, delivering a mandate for an affordable city, a politics of the future, and a leader unafraid to fight back against rising authoritarianism,” he said. “I am humbled by the support of more than 545,000 New Yorkers who voted for our campaign and am excited to expand this coalition even further as we defeat Eric Adams and win a city government that puts working people first.”

How Zohran Mamdani, a critic of Israel, excelled among Democrats in America's most Jewish city

Mamdani's win had been widely expected since he took a commanding lead after the polls closed a week ago, falling just short of the 50 per cent of the vote needed to avoid another count under the city's ranked choice voting model. The system allows voters' other preferences to be counted if their top candidate falls out of the running.

Mamdani, who declared victory the night of the June 24 primary, will face a general election field that includes incumbent Mayor Eric Adams as well as independent candidate Jim Walden and Republican Curtis Sliwa.

Cuomo conceded defeat just hours after the polls closed last week but is contemplating whether to run in the general election on an independent ballot line. After the release of Tuesday's vote count, Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi said “We'll be continuing conversations with people from all across the city while determining next steps.”

“Extremism, division and empty promises are not the answer to this city's problems, and while this was a look at what motivates a slice of our primary electorate, it does not represent the majority,” Azzopardi said. “The financial instability of our families is the priority here, which is why actionable solutions, results and outcomes matter so much.”

Explainer: Who is Zohran Mamdani, the state lawmaker seeking to become New York's first Muslim mayor?

Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist and member of the state Assembly, was virtually unknown when he launched his candidacy centred on a bold slate of populist ideas. But he built an energetic campaign that ran circles around Cuomo as the older, more moderate Democrat tried to come back from the sexual harassment scandal that led to his resignation four years ago.

The results, even before they were finalized, sent a shock wave through the political world.

Mamdani's campaign, which was focused on lowering the cost of living, claims it has found a new blueprint for Democrats who have at times appeared rudderless during President Donald Trump's climb back to power.

The Democratic establishment has approached Mamdani with caution. Many of its big players applauded his campaign but don't seem ready to throw their full support behind the young progressive, whose past criticisms of law enforcement, use of the word “genocide” to describe the Israeli government's actions in Gaza and “democratic socialist” label amount to landmines for some in the party.

If elected, Mamdani would be the city's first Muslim mayor and its first of Indian American decent. He would also be one of its youngest.

For Republicans, Mamdani has already provided a new angle for attack. Trump and others in the GOP have begun to launch broadsides at him, moving to cast Mamdani as the epitome of leftist excess ahead of consequential elections elsewhere this year and next.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that if New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani interferes with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, then 'we'll have to arrest him.'

“If I'm a Republican, I want this guy to win,” said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University. “Because I want to be able to compare and contrast my campaign as a Republican, in a national election, to the idea of, ‘This is where the Democratic party is.'”

New York City's ranked choice voting model allows voters to list up to five candidates on their ballots in order of preference. If a single candidate is the first choice of more than 50% of voters, then that person wins the race outright. Since no candidate cleared that bar on the night of the primary, the ranked choice voting process kicked in. The board is scheduled to certify the election on July 15.

Mamdani has been a member of the state Assembly since 2021, and has characterized his inexperience as a potential asset. His campaign promised free city buses, free child care, a rent freeze for people living in rent-stabilized apartment, government-run grocery stores and more, all paid for with taxes on the wealthy. Critics have slammed his agenda as politically unrealistic.

Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, rose to the top in a race that was for months dominated by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani's energetic campaign centered on lowering the city's cost of living.

Historian and journalist Sebastian Haffner was 24 when he penned an unpublished romance novel set amid Hitler's ominous rise to power. Almost a century later, it's a literary sensation.

A young and restive Sebastian Haffner was typical of a generation of German writers and journalists who left their homeland in the 1930s to escape Nazi rule.

Relocating to London, Haffner described the headwinds of dictatorship in his historical memoir,  ""Defying Hitler"" — a book he shelved at the time, but was published to much fanfare in 2002.

That foreboding story of a young man coming-of-age in interwar Germany was preceded by a novel conceived when the writer was only 24. Titled ""Abschied,"" or ""Parting,"" the long-forgotten manuscript was discovered by the writer's son, Oliver Pretzel, after the author's death in 1999.

It took almost a quarter of a century to get published. But the tale of young love torn between Berlin and Paris topped the German bestseller list only a week after it was published in June.

""Parting"" was written in a few weeks in late 1932 as a troubled Weimar Republic was being supplanted by fascism and as Hitler worked on his rise to power. The author's name was then Raimund Pretzel; he took the pseudonym Sebastian Haffner to protect his identity after arriving in the UK in 1938.

Haffner was then a liberal trainee lawyer at a Berlin court who would witness Jewish and social-democratic judges being expelled as the Nazis took power.

But despite the novel's pervading sense of doom, the autobiographical love story retained a sense of hope.

Florian Kessel, the book's publisher at Hanser Verlag, called it ""a wonderfully free novel, full of smoking and hanging out together and falling in love to the point of ecstasy."" Yet it is also ""full of allusions to the violent history of the decade that was unfolding.""

According to author and literary critic Volker Weidermann, who contributed the novel's epilogue, the story echoed Haffner's own love for a woman in Berlin who left for Paris in the early 1930s before he followed.

But the love affair between Raimund and Teddy is ""basically already over"" when he arrives in Paris and tries to rekindle a late summer romance. She saw the writing on the wall as Germany became more nationalistic and antisemitic. He hung around in Berlin until it was too late. 

Teddy's real name was Gertrude Joseph, a Vienna-born Jewish woman who Haffner met in Berlin before she went to study at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1930. They met again in the German capital in 1933, whence she informed him she was getting married and would never return. It was then that Haffner decided to follow her to Paris. Joseph ultimately had a family in Sweden, though the two maintained correspondence throughout their life, according to Weidermann.

The ""Parting"" manuscript was found in a drawer next to ""History of a German,"" the non-fiction work that became ""Defying Hitler."" Yet it was published 23 years later, partly due to ""different views in the family about publishing the manuscript,"" Oliver Pretzel recounted in an interview with Republik Magazin.

""He hadn't written anything about it in his will,"" said Pretzel of his father. But Haffner's son, along with his nephew, who inherited the rights to it from his mother, finally agreed to publish the book — which Pretzel himself edited.

Haffner's heirs were understandably ""worried"" that this ""early, light, youthful text"" might muddy the ""good reputation of the serious historian,"" wrote Weidermann.

But it was precisely this ""rapturous"" and ""breathless"" novel that ""describes the source of the grief on which his later books rest on,"" he added.

The literary critic was referring to texts like ""Germany: Jekyll & Hide"" (1940), the story of how German society embraced Nazism after it reacted to defeat in World War One with ""resentment, defiance, and spite.""

Printed hastily before the Nazi invasion of Belgium and the Netherlands in the hope of influencing German readers, the New York Times in 1941 called the book an ""excellent analysis of Germany's ills,"" and of a population's willingness to ""hitch its wagon to an evil star.""

In ""Defying Hitler,"" Haffner described a scene at his high court office that typified his insightful and prophetic journalistic oeuvre.   

""Then, not particularly loudly, somebody else said, 'They're throwing out the Jews,' and a few others laughed. At that moment this laughter alarmed me more than what was actually happening. With a start I realized there were Nazis working in this room.""

In his journalistic and historical writings, Haffner, who returned to Germany in 1954, was perceived as ""a forensic scientist of the German soul [who] works with a scalpel,"" according to Swiss author and literary critic Matthias Zehnder. ""His novel, on the other hand, is dabbed on with impressionistic lightness.""

The publication of ""Parting"" hints at a talent for fiction that was never allowed to flourish.

""What a novelist Sebastian Haffner would have been!"" wrote Weidermman, referring to the author's ""tremendous powers of observation, his enormous wit, sentence after sentence.""

Oliver Pretzel described how he discovered both ""Denying Hitler"" and ""Parting"" in the same drawer after his father's death, but how both were very different.

""I particularly liked 'Parting' because it has such a light tone and is basically still full of joie de vivre, which is somewhat lacking in 'Defying Hitler.'"" he said in an interview with publisher Hanser. ""You get the feeling that he takes a gloomy view of the world, whereas in 'Parting' it is a hopeful view.""

			Joe Biden nominated her on grounds of identity politics. Now even her fellow justices are brutally dismantling her arguments

In January 2022, one year after Joe Biden assumed the White House, Justice Stephen Breyer of the US Supreme Court announced his impending retirement. Biden, who had selected the intellectually challenged Kamala Harris as his running mate two years prior, in large part on diversity grounds, sprang into action to fulfil a campaign promise to black political kingmaker Rep Jim Clyburn (D-SC) – that he would select a black woman for his first Supreme Court pick.

And so the Biden White House foisted upon us Ketanji Brown Jackson – a hitherto obscure jurist, nominated because of her sex and race, but who ironically refused to provide a definition of the word “woman” when asked about it at her US Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing. Curious, that!

Alas, it has only been downhill from that rockiest of rocky starts.

I pondered, at the time of Jackson's nomination, how a justice who knows she was selected on the basis of identity politics could be expected to fairly adjudicate cases that involve issues of race and sex?

My concern proved prescient. Barely a year after her nomination, Justice Clarence Thomas – the Court's longest-serving member, who also happens to be black – excoriated Jackson's “myopia” in his concurring opinion in Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) v Harvard, which ended the systemic racism of “affirmative action” in university admissions: “Justice Jackson's race-infused world view falls flat at each step. Individuals are the sum of their unique experiences, challenges, and accomplishments. What matters is not the barriers they face, but how they choose to confront them. And their race is not to blame for everything – good or bad – that happens in their lives. A contrary, myopic world view based on individuals' skin colour to the total exclusion of their personal choices is nothing short of racial determinism.”

As part of her SFFA dissent, notably, Jackson also made a “mathematically absurd” claim about black infant mortality. Any decent law clerk – or any decent judge – would have caught on before publication. By missing the obvious, Jackson demonstrated precisely the sort of brazen nitwittery that should have cautioned political leaders away from allowing the search for one of the nine most important lawyers to be determined by identity politics.

Yet as satisfying as Thomas's defenestration of Jackson in his SFFA concurrence was, Friday's fusillade from Justice Amy Coney Barrett in her majority opinion in Trump v CASA, a case addressing the contentious debate over the legitimacy of so-called nationwide injunctions, was if anything even more fulfilling. Barrett took a mighty, acerbic sledgehammer to Jackson's paean to unvarnished judicial supremacy.

“We will not dwell on Justice Jackson's argument, which is at odds with more than two centuries' worth of precedent, not to mention the Constitution itself,” Barrett wrote. “We observe only this: Justice Jackson decries an imperial Executive while embracing an imperial Judiciary.”

What's more, Jackson “chooses a starting line of attack that is tethered neither to [historical] sources nor, frankly, to any doctrine whatsoever”. And “among its many problems, Justice Jackson's view is at odds with our system of divided judicial authority”. Perhaps most bitingly, Barrett mocked Jackson's glossing over the all-important inquiry as to the historical “limits on judicial authority” as mere “legalese” (Jackson's own ignominious word choice).

In a word: brutal. Notably, all six of the Court's Republican-nominated justices, including the ever-mercurial chief justice, John Roberts, signed onto Barrett's opinion in full. Call it a pile-on.

One cannot help but get the sense that Barrett, the normally mild-mannered former law professor and mother of seven, really just wanted to say: “Justice Jackson is unfit to serve on this Court.” And maybe she should have done so. Because it happens to be true.

The fact that Ketanji Brown Jackson was selected as a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States on the basis of her race and sex is offensive enough. But the fact she now routinely produces such intellectually indefensible balderdash that she is roundly mocked by her more senior colleagues, takes the level of offence to a different level. Simply put, serious countries do not elevate arguably unqualified dimwits to public positions of extraordinary prominence.

The continued humiliation of Ketanji Brown Jackson at the nation's highest court – at the behest of her colleagues – is a lagging social indication. It is a warning that something has gone deeply wrong in how the world's pre-eminent superpower nominates the most prestigious constitutional officers and decides the most pressing constitutional issues. The America that just sent B-2 bombers to drop 14 “bunker buster” bombs on Iran's nuclear facilities is a serious place. The America that counts Ketanji Brown Jackson as a Supreme Court justice? Less so.

Frankly, no one should be more offended at this appalling DEI idiocy than Jackson's fellow black women. Because Jackson was nominated explicitly due to the fact she is a black woman. Ah yes – but we can't possibly define what a woman is, can we? And therein lies the rub.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is visiting the United States next week to meet with President Donald Trump and other top officials in the U.S. administration, supposedly to “capitalize on the success” of the 12-day war against Iran. This comes after nearly 21 months of Israel's war on Gaza that has killed at least 56,000 Palestinians, with daily violence only increasing. “There's basically an airstrike every other minute,” says Palestinian writer and analyst Muhammad Shehada. “There's nonstop artillery fire, gunfire, machine gunfire, as well as Israeli quadcopter drones that are swarming Gaza and shooting people at random.” While there have been news reports of a possible ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, Shehada says “there are no negotiations,” and therefore no end in sight to the daily bloodshed.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced he'll be coming to the U.S. next week to meet with President Trump and other officials in the administration. He says the meetings will discuss how to, quote, “capitalize on the success” of the attack on Iran by Israel and the United States.

PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: [translated] I am expected to travel next week to the United States for meetings with the president of the United States, Donald Trump, with Vice President Vance, with the secretary of state and the national security adviser, Marco Rubio, with the Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, with the president's envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and with the secretary of commerce. We have a few matters to finalize beforehand in order to reach a trade agreement, in addition to other issues. There will also be meetings with congressional and Senate leaders and security meetings, which I will not elaborate on here. These matters follow the great victory we achieved in Operation Am Kalavi. Capitalizing on success is no less important than achieving it.

AMY GOODMAN: Will Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, be talking also about Gaza?

We're joined now by Muhammad Shehada, a writer and analyst from Gaza, visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

Thanks so much for being with us, Muhammad. Many have said that Israel's attack on Iran, that part of it was to distract from what's happening in Gaza, the intensification of the violence. Can you talk about what's happening there on the West Bank?

MUHAMMAD SHEHADA: Thanks so much, Amy, for having me.

Yes, precisely, I was in Brussels right before the Israeli attack on Iran, and Gaza became a very prominent headline there. There was so much momentum that European leaders couldn't escape away from it. They had to save face. And as soon as the attack on Iran happened, you can see them immediately having a giant moment of relief. They were delighted that Gaza would disappear from headlines, and they're very keen to keep it this way.

Right now the situation there, you basically have Israel having lined up the entire population like ducks in less than a fifth of Gaza's area. They issued over 50 evacuation orders since March 18th. The latest evacuation orders were issued to the most populated areas in Gaza City itself, the areas where there was some ability to maintain organized human life. And basically, Israel is asking them to evacuate to the very areas that have been evacuated already, to an area that is already under an evacuation order, Deir al-Balah and Zawayda.

And basically, recently an Israeli officer called an elderly Gazan, and he said, “You have to evacuate now. We're issuing mass evacuation orders for your area.” The old man responded with tears in his eyes, and he said, “Go ahead. Bomb us. We have nowhere to go. We don't even have physical energy to run away.” And he started to beg the Israeli officer, literally. He started to beg him to bomb them. He said, “Just let us rest. Bomb us now.” And then, when the argument escalated, he started begging the officer for food. He said, “If you're going to send planes here anyways, just let them drop any food on us so that we can get any energy to move from this area.” And he started to plead with the officer and saying that “I was a worker in Israel. A lot of the people here around me used to work in your country. We built your country from scratch.” And none of this worked. The conversation ended without having any sort of humane reaction from the Israeli officer, other than leave the area.

The evacuation orders are there only as a pretext to allow Israel to carpet bomb, to indiscriminately bomb a whole area nonstop. So, my colleagues on the ground have been saying that since last week, the intensity of the Israeli bombardment is the largest they've ever seen in months. There's basically an airstrike every other minute. There's nonstop artillery fire, gunfire, machine gunfire, as well as Israeli quadcopter drones that are swarming Gaza and shooting people at random, in addition to what you see now with the rampant starvation.

A single bag of wheat flour costs about 50 U.S. dollars. A single pound of sugar costs about $35. And Israel allows a maximum of what would be the equivalent — in the GHF sites, it's 20 trucks per day, which is the equivalent of four ounces of food, 125 grams of food per person per day, as the only thing. In any concentration camp in human history, people got more food than they do right now in Gaza.

So, that's the picture you have, with the death trap being the cherry on top, Israel basically laying a mousetrap with fake cheese to Gazans to go to GHF distribution sites to only get shot. It's now basically etched in the minds of everyone I know in Gaza that trying to find food is synonymous to death, especially for kids. They associate it immediately with the killing or the death of loved ones. So, my close friend Ibrahim in Gaza City right now, he told me that whenever he tries to leave home to go look for food, his son starts to scream and kick and cry, because he understands that leaving to try to find food is a death sentence, and he would rather that they starve than finding his own family being killed.

But nonetheless, and that's the most depraved part of it, Amy, is that my friends and family on the ground tell me that once the starvation gets too severe, it dulls your senses. It sort of shuts down your brain. An empty stomach means an empty mind. And your basic survival instinct forces you to walk, to march like a zombie towards these distribution centers, only to get shot on the way. The chances of survival, they are very slim. So, the overall picture is just a genocide.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Muhammad Shehada, this carnage, this genocide, is occurring while here in the United States the Trump administration yesterday approved $510 million in additional arms sales to Israel. Your response to this continued U.S. financing of this killing?

MUHAMMAD SHEHADA: Well, basically, at this rate, anyone that wants to know knows what's going on. You have a record number of Israeli experts, human rights experts, that are saying this is a genocide unfolding in Gaza.

And Trump's only response has been twofold, to keep showering Israel with gifts, with weaponry, and at the same time to pretend that there is sort of, quote, “a breakthrough,” an imminent breakthrough, in the ceasefire negotiations. Let me be clear: There is none. There are no negotiations to begin with. Qatar yesterday announced there are no — there's no progress. There are no negotiations. Hamas, as well, said there is no one — nobody is reaching out to us to ask for negotiating a ceasefire or the release of Israeli captives. There is just the mirage, the facade of negotiations that Netanyahu and Trump keep reviving every time Gaza jumps back to the headlines, as to numb, to suppress any coverage of Gaza, to create some false hope that there is a breakthrough, to sort of circumvent or suppress any room for pressure on Israel.

And the picture is not any better in Europe. Like, if you look at European sort of escalating rhetoric towards Israel, it was also an empty maneuver to just circumvent pressure to act. So, for example, European governments, like Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Australia and Norway — Western governments, they basically recently imposed sanctions on Ben-Gvir and Smotrich. The sanctions were very well choreographed, articulated in a way as to evade holding the Israeli government accountable. They only penalize the two ministers for statements, not actions, and for statements on the West Bank, not Gaza, because if they had looked into actions or statements on Gaza, it would have incriminated the entire Israeli government. So, what we see is basically just mere headline-grabbing gestures that are there to buy time, while at the same time continuing to funnel unrestricted, unconstrained support for the very genocide that those countries are claiming to be concerned about.

AMY GOODMAN: Muhammad Shehada, we want to thank you for joining us from Copenhagen, writer and analyst from Gaza, visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

This news from Al Jazeera: Britain's High Court has ruled the government's decision to allow the export of Lockheed Martin F-35 jet parts to Israel is lawful, despite accepting that they could be used in breach of international humanitarian law.

Next up, we go to Geneva to speak with U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk. He says Israel is committing ethnic cleansing in Gaza. Back in 20 seconds.

Amazon, BlackRock, and Keller Williams LLC are some of the companies named in the report.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

UN human rights expert Francesca Albanese has released a report naming dozens of companies that bear complicity in Israel's genocide and apartheid in Palestine, aiming to show how companies have built Israel's occupation into a sprawling, profitable industry.

In her report released Monday, Albanese names over 60 companies, including numerous U.S.-based companies, for their role in advancing Israel's military campaign, settlement building, and mass forced displacement.

These companies are either directly providing goods used to demolish Palestinian homes and kill Palestinian people, like Caterpillar Inc., or Lockheed Martin; or supporting Israel through other means, like holding real estate sales or investing in companies who provide direct support, like Keller Williams Realty LLC or BlackRock, respectively.

Big Tech is especially involved, with Albanese calling out some of the largest tech companies in the U.S. for providing logistical support for Israel, like Amazon and Alphabet, Google's parent company.

The report follows a call for input for complicity with Israel within the private sector from Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories. Albanese writes that she received hundreds of submissions, and has built a database of 1,000 corporate entities who are “implicated in human rights violations and international crimes in the occupied Palestinian territory,” she writes. 

These submissions build upon a previously established database of business enterprises linked to Israeli settlements gathered by the UN human rights office, which was last updated in June 2023, prior to the Gaza genocide. Activist and advocacy groups have previously compiled lists of companies as potential targets for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, or for protests and blockades.

“The corporate sector has materially contributed to [Israel's settler-colonialism] by providing Israel with the weapons and machinery required to destroy homes, schools, hospitals, places of leisure and worship, livelihoods and productive assets, such as olive groves and orchards, to segregate and control communities and to restrict access to natural resources,” Albanese writes.

“By helping to militarize and incentivize illegal Israeli presence in the occupied Palestinian territory, the corporate sector has contributed to the creation of the conditions for Palestinian ethnic cleansing,” the report goes on.

Albanese directly names just a few dozen of these companies in her report, representing some of the companies most entrenched in Israel's genocide and apartheid industry. 

They include numerous U.S.-based corporations and institutions, as well as international companies like shipping giant Maersk and heavy equipment manufacturer HD Hyundai.

“While life in Gaza is being obliterated and the West Bank is under escalating assault, the present report shows why the genocide carried out by Israel continues: because it is lucrative for many,” Albanese writes. “Business continues as usual, but nothing about this system, in which businesses are integral, is neutral.”

Below is a list of the U.S. companies mentioned by Albanese in the report, representing a non-exhaustive list of U.S. firms with involvement in Israel's atrocities.

Follow:


            Zohran Mamdani clinched victory Tuesday in the Democratic primary for mayor of New York, cementing an upset that already has shaken national politics.
    


            The 33-year-old state assemblyman and democratic socialist had been all but assured to be the party's nominee after the June 24 primary. But because Mamdani hadn't won a majority of first-choice votes, it took a tabulation of the city's ranked-choice votes released Tuesday to put Mamdani over 50% he needed to win.
    


            Mamdani's upset of the far better-known Andrew Cuomo has sent shockwaves through the national Democratic Party since the initial results were announced last week.
    


            As Democrats seek to figure out how to harness the young progressive's energy, if not all his policy proposals, Republicans have tried to elevate him as the face of their opposition.

            “This is just the beginning of our expanding coalition to make New York City affordable,” Mamdani wrote on X after the results were posted. “And we will do it together.”
    


            Mamdani's victory sets up a potentially messy general election contest. Mayor Eric Adams, four years after winning the Democratic primary, is seeking reelection as an independent. Republican Curtis Sliwa is running. And Cuomo, the former New York governor, is keeping his “Fight and Deliver” ballot line for the general election, although he hasn't committed to running an active campaign.
    


            Tuesday's results, which aren't final but include nearly all of the votes that will be counted in the race, showed Mamdani defeating Cuomo 56% to 44% in the final round.
    


            Preliminary Board of Elections data show that Mamdani likely benefitted from ranked choice voting and cross endorsements as part of his campaign strategy.
    


            In the last weeks of the campaign, Mamdani cross-endorsed with City Comptroller Brad Lander. The Working Families Party rolled out a slate of endorsements which ranked Mamdani first and Lander second. Both the Mamdani and Lander campaigns also made it a point to encourage voters to “not rank Cuomo” in the days leading up to the election.
    


            The strategy appears to have paid off. Mamdani captured 48% of re-allocated votes while Cuomo, who did not cross-endorse with any candidates, only got 26% of re-allocated votes.
    


            Rich Azzopardi, a spokesperson for Cuomo, issued a statement Tuesday which noted the former governor has not yet decided whether he will run an active general election campaign but made clear he was considering doing so. He argued a “massive spike” in voters under the age of 30 made it impossible to predict Mamdani's victory.
    


            “Extremism, division and empty promises are not the answer to this city's problems, and while this was a look at what motivates a slice of our primary electorate, it does not represent the majority,” Azzopardi said. “We'll be continuing conversations with people from all across the city while determining next steps.”
    


            In his statement, Azzopardi also took a swipe at Adams, noting that Cuomo still captured 24,000 more votes in the final round than Adams did in the 2021 primary when he was first elected.
    


            The difference in votes is likely one of the key numbers the Cuomo camp is focused on. Should he decide to move forward with a campaign, Cuomo would need to pursue the same moderate Democrats Adams is likely to try and court from now until November.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Legally mandated U.S. national climate assessments seem to have disappeared from the federal websites built to display them, making it harder for state and local governments and the public to learn what to expect in their backyards from a warming world.

Scientists said the peer-reviewed authoritative reports save money and lives. Websites for the national assessments and the U.S. Global Change Research Program were down Monday and Tuesday with no links, notes or referrals elsewhere. The White House, which was responsible for the assessments, said the information will be housed within NASA to comply with the law, but gave no further details.

Searches for the assessments on NASA websites did not turn them up. NASA did not respond to requests for information. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which coordinated the information in the assessments, did not respond to repeated inquiries.

“It's critical for decision makers across the country to know what the science in the National Climate Assessment is. That is the most reliable and well-reviewed source of information about climate that exists for the United States,” said University of Arizona climate scientist Kathy Jacobs, who coordinated the 2014 version of the report. 

“It's a sad day for the United States if it is true that the National Climate Assessment is no longer available,” Jacobs said. “This is evidence of serious tampering with the facts and with people's access to information, and it actually may increase the risk of people being harmed by climate-related impacts.”




Harvard climate scientist John Holdren, who was President Obama's science advisor and whose office directed the assessments, said after the 2014 edition he visited governors, mayors and other local officials who told him how useful the 841-page report was. It helped them decide whether to raise roads, build seawalls and even move hospital generators from basements to roofs, he said.

“This is a government resource paid for by the taxpayer to provide the information that really is the primary source of information for any city, state or federal agency who's trying to prepare for the impacts of a changing climate,” said Texas Tech climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, who has been a volunteer author for several editions of the report. 

Copies of past reports are still squirreled away in NOAA's library. NASA's open science data repository includes dead links to the assessment site.

The most recent report, issued in 2023, included an interactive atlas that zoomed down to the county level. It found that climate change is affecting people's security, health and livelihoods in every corner of the country in different ways, with minority and Native American communities often disproportionately at risk.

The 1990 Global Change Research Act requires a national climate assessment every four years and directs the president to establish an interagency United States Global Change Research Program. In the spring, the Trump administration told the volunteer authors of the next climate assessment that their services weren't needed and ended the contract with the private firm that helps coordinate the website and report.

Additionally, NOAA's main climate.gov website was recently forwarded to a different NOAA website. Social media and blogs at NOAA and NASA about climate impacts for the general public were cut or eliminated.

“It's part of a horrifying big picture,” Holdren said. “It's just an appalling whole demolition of science infrastructure.”

The national assessments are more useful than international climate reports put out by the United Nations every seven or so years because they are more localized and more detailed, Hayhoe and Jacobs said. 

The national reports are not only peer reviewed by other scientists, but examined for accuracy by the National Academy of Sciences, federal agencies, the staff and the public. 

Hiding the reports would be censoring science, Jacobs said. 

And it's dangerous for the country, Hayhoe said, comparing it to steering a car on a curving road by only looking through the rearview mirror: “And now, more than ever, we need to be looking ahead to do everything it takes to make it around that curve safely. It's like our windshield's being painted over.”

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram provides latest updates from Capitol Hill on marathon Senate voting on President Donald Trump's ‘big, beautiful bill.'

The Senate has completed consideration of President Donald Trump's $3.3 trillion, 940-page agenda bill, sending it back to the House of Representatives to sync up before hitting the commander in chief's desk for his signature.

It first passed the House by just one vote in late May, and now it must advance through the chamber one more time before it can be signed into law.

That's because the Senate made some key changes to the legislation, chiefly to pass the ""Byrd Bath"" process in which its various measures are weighed for whether they adhere to the strict guidelines of the budget reconciliation process.

Republicans are using budget reconciliation to pass Trump's agenda on taxes, the border, energy, defense and the national debt. It allows the party in power to pass fiscal legislation while sidelining the minority – in this case, Democrats – by lowering the Senate's threshold for passage from 60 to 51. 

Here are some of the key changes between the two versions:

Stricter work requirements have been the crown jewel for the GOP, being included in both versions. The bill would require ​​able-bodied, childless adults between the ages of 18 and 64 to work at least 80 hours a month to maintain their benefits, or by ​​participating in community service, going to school or engaging in a work program.

But there are more divisive changes, like tweaks to the Medicaid provider tax rate. The rate change would, year-by-year, lower the provider tax in Medicaid expansion states from 6 %to 3.5%. The plan was tweaked to comply with Senate rules, and now starts in fiscal year 2028. 

The House bill, in comparison, would have frozen states at their current rates and placed a moratorium on new provider taxes.

It's a sticking point for moderate House Republicans who could see their states be forced to foot more of the bill for Medicaid than they currently do, risking politically damaging cuts to the program.

The Senate bill also includes a $50 billion fund to help rural hospitals in a bid to ease the concerns of Republicans in their own chamber.

The Senate bill aims to raise the debt limit by $5 trillion, $1 trillion higher than the House bill called for.

The U.S. national debt is currently just over $36 trillion.

A failure to raise that limit – also called the debt ceiling – before the U.S. government runs out of cash to pay its obligations could result in a downgrade in the country's credit rating and potential turmoil in financial markets.

Trump has made it a priority for congressional Republicans to deal with the debt ceiling and avoid a national credit default.

A bipartisan agreement struck in 2023 suspended the debt ceiling until January 2025.

Multiple projections show the U.S. is poised to run out of cash to pay its debts by sometime this summer.

The Senate version of the legislation provides more generous corporate tax benefits than the House version, while placing limits on Trump's newer policies, eliminating taxes on tips and overtime pay.

Both bills sought to permanently extend the income tax brackets of Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).

The Senate bill makes permanent some corporate tax breaks that the House bill only temporarily expanded. It also makes permanent the standard deduction for personal income taxes, while the House bill only extended it through 2028.

The Senate bill would also allow people to deduct taxes on up to $25,000 of tipped wages. That deduction would begin to phase out for people making $150,000 per year or $300,000 as a married couple.

On the House side, the deduction is eliminated for both married and single filers making above $160,000. There is no cap of any kind on the amount that can be deducted, however.

Those same income differences are at play between the Senate and House versions of Trump's ""no tax on overtime pay"" promise. Whereas the Senate bill would allow people to deduct up to $12,500 in overtime pay, the House version did not include a stated limit.

The House version of the bill would have effectively blocked states from implementing their own AI regulations – a provision that was stripped out of the Senate bill even despite negotiations with critics to salvage the measure.

Sen. Masha Blackburn, R-Tenn., led the Senate GOP opposition to the measure, arguing it would prevent states from shielding populations who are vulnerable to the pitfalls of AI.

After talks with key senators fell through, Blackburn and Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., co-sponsored an amendment to remove that provision. It passed 99 to 1.

Outside of Washington, 17 Republican state governors wrote to Congress objecting to the AI moratorium. 

""This is a monumental win for Republican governors, President Trump's one, big beautiful bill, and the American people,"" Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, one of the signatories, wrote on X after it was removed.

President Donald Trump's sprawling domestic policy agenda narrowly passed the Republican-led Senate Tuesday after Vice President JD Vance cast the tiebreaking vote, capping off weeks of intense negotiations in the upper chamber to muscle through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The marquee legislation, which advances Trump's second-term priorities on tax cuts, energy, and the border, now heads to the GOP-led House, where leaders are corralling votes to pass it by the president's July 4 deadline.

The bill cleared the Senate in a 51-50 vote. Sens. Thom Tillis (R-NC), Rand Paul (R-KY), and Susan Collins (R-ME) were the three Republican defectors who forced Vance to intercede and break the logjam after hours of arduous debate on and off the Senate floor that threatened to derail Trump's signature legislation at the eleventh hour.

The passage of the filibuster-skirting bill was the culmination of a messy and drawn-out budget reconciliation process and was preceded by days of debate, amendment votes, and backroom deal-making by Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) to win over enough Republican holdouts. Senators endured a grueling marathon amendment voting session in the hours leading up to the final vote, in which mainly Democrats and some Republicans forced dozens of roll-call votes over 26 hours beginning Monday morning.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) will now be tasked with overcoming hurdles and complaints in his GOP conference. Complicating matters is that the Congressional Budget Office said the Senate version will add some $3.3 trillion to deficits over the next decade, which the House Freedom Caucus said violates the cost-cutting agreements in the budget framework. But the CBO also scored the bill using current policy baseline and found the legislation would reduce the deficit by $508 billion.

The “current policy baseline” is a novel accounting method that suggests it is cost-free to make permanent the 2017 Trump tax cuts that would otherwise expire next year. The White House also argued that economic growth from the bill would offset the deficit hit.

Notably, the CBO's $3.3 trillion number doesn't measure the bill against current policy. Rather, CBO assumes Congress would have allowed for a $4.5 trillion tax increase by letting Trump's 2017 tax cuts expire at the end of this year.

Democrats, and some GOP fiscal hawks such as Paul, decried it as a gimmick. The measure also raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.

The heart of the legislation is extending and making permanent the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from Trump's first term, which lowered individual tax rates to the current levels that are set to expire at year's end. One of the biggest imprints the Senate made on the bill compared to a version previously passed by the House was to make permanent the business tax cuts, which the lower chamber only proposed to extend temporarily.

Senate Republicans settled on maintaining the House's $40,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, a thorny issue for blue-state House Republicans whose constituents pay higher state taxes. The figure would quadruple the current rate of $10,000, as set by Trump's 2017 tax bill.

SALT critics argue the deductions primarily benefit high-income earners in liberal states and subsidize spending by state and local governments led by Democrats. The provision was crucial to win over key SALT proponents such as Reps. Mike Lawler (R-NY) and Nick LaLota (R-NY).

However, the $40,000 cap lasts only five years before snapping back to the $10,000 current limit.

Other new tax measures include versions of Trump's campaign promises to exempt taxes on tips, reduce Social Security taxes, and eliminate taxes on overtime.

The bill would set a $25,000 limit for deductions on tipped income and phase out for single filers and joint filers who earn more than $150,000 and $300,000 annually, respectively.  

The legislation would allow up to $10,000 in auto loan interest to be deducted, phasing out for single filers who make annually more than $100,000 and $200,000 for joint filers. Only new cars assembled in the United States would be eligible.

A $6,000 deduction for seniors over 65 would be created as part of Trump's pledge to end taxes on Social Security benefits.

Another area of tax policy closely watched and debated was the child tax credit, an increasingly popular benefit among populist conservatives who want to encourage more people to have families.

Under the Senate's proposal, the credit would increase from $2,000 to $2,200 per child. That's down from $2,500 under the House version. However, the Senate would make the increase permanent, whereas it would expire after 2028 in the House bill. Pro-family conservatives, including Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), wanted the credit as high as $5,000.

The Senate legislation also boosts the child and dependent care tax credit, known as the CDCTC. 

On border security, the legislation includes nearly $200 billion over the next decade to beef up illegal immigration enforcement, which has been a major focus of the Trump administration. There is funding for the construction of additional southern border wall, immigration detention centers, state and local grants, surveillance technology, and broader enforcement and removal operations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Justice Department.

“The Big Beautiful Bill will allow ICE to hire 10,000 new officers,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “ICE currently has 20,000 law-enforcement and support personnel in more than 400 offices. A larger force will provide ICE agents with the necessary protection so they can continue to carry out removals.”

In a bid to crack down on federal spending and illegal immigration further, the bill strips benefits for most noncitizens from government programs such as Medicaid and food stamps.

The bill makes major changes to healthcare, particularly to Medicaid, the government-run health insurance program for some 80 million lower-income adults and children. It creates work requirements for childless, able-bodied adults, and it would defund Planned Parenthood by prohibiting Medicaid funds from being used to reimburse health clinics that provide abortions.

The megabill would also rework the Medicaid provider tax framework that shrinks federal reimbursements to states for beneficiaries, a major concern of so-called “Medicaid moderates,” who feared the change could bankrupt rural hospitals in red states. The provision led Tillis to oppose the bill and others to threaten to withhold their support until concessions were made.

THOM TILLIS ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT AFTER OPPOSING TRUMP TAX BILL

On energy, federal subsidies for wind and solar projects are set to take a major funding hit by the rollback of clean energy tax credits from former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. Senate Republicans opted to accelerate the credit phase-outs, similar to an earlier proposal from the House (the original Senate proposal was the soft one). But in a win for conservative conservationists, a controversial proposal from Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) to sell tracts of public lands to help pay for Trump's tax cuts was stripped from the text.

Food stamps through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would be reduced by nearly $70 billion through work requirements and $40 billion with state matching funds. Another roughly $85 billion is cut elsewhere from the program.

Death, estrangement, a struggling friend: How does one carry on when the worst keeps happening?

Dear James,

I'm a 20-year-old dealing with a string of terrible events. My estranged mother died in a car accident a few days ago. A close friend of mine has been hospitalized for mental-health reasons, and I haven't heard from them. I recently had a falling-out with my family; the details are complicated, but, long story short, I was forced to move out of my family home and am now living at my partner's.

What should I do? How should I even feel? How do you retain your compassion and drive when the worst keeps coming your way?

Dear Reader,

I read somewhere that Carl Jung, if you came to him with news of a wonderful event in your life, would shake his head and say words to the effect of: Well, that's very unfortunate, but if we pull together we can probably make it through this. Conversely, if you'd had bad luck, or were experiencing a personal downturn, he would offer you his heartiest congratulations.

The point being, I suppose, that these up-against-it moments—like the one in which you find yourself—are the places where we grow and learn, about life and about ourselves. Not that this is any consolation to you right now: You're just trying to keep it together under an onslaught of events and emotions. But as much as the current situation is filling your windshield, covering every inch of available surface, I'm pretty sure that, sooner than you think, you'll have all of this in your rearview mirror. And how you look back on it, how you feel about it, will be determined by one thing: whether you kept an open heart.

You identify clearly the risk of being overwhelmed—a sealing-up of the self that leads to loss of feeling for other people, loss of connection to your own sacred momentum. This is suffering in its demonic aspect; it grinds off your humanity. So there's the challenge. Don't be defeated. Don't go into a defensive crouch. Stay upright and available to what's going on, even if—especially if—what's going on is pretty terrible.

I'll say this to you as well: You are young and strong. Me, at the age of 57 and with all of my various habits—I'm susceptible. The faintest touch of calamity lays me out. But you can probably run for days on two hours of sleep and a graham cracker. You can survive this. One upside to everything being awful, to your whole world going acute, as it were, is that you know it can't last. Acuteness, by its nature, has to turn into something else. So hang in there, try not to identify completely with the feelings that are blasting through you (they will pass), and keep your eye on the horizon. Relief is coming.

Sending you the power vibes,

James

The $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts will be felt by all Americans.

Senate Republicans have passed President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill,” a move that will make major changes to Medicaid through establishing a work requirement for the first time and restricting states' ability to finance their share of the program's costs. If the bill ultimately becomes law after passing the House and receiving Trump's signature — which could all happen before Friday — American health care is never going to be the same.

The consequences will be dire. 

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the legislation would slash Medicaid spending by more than $1 trillion and that nearly 12 million people would lose their health insurance. Republicans added a last-minute infusion of funding for rural hospitals to assuage moderates skittish about the Medicaid cuts, but hospitals say the legislation will still be devastating to their business and their patients.

The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life.

When combined with the expiration of Obamacare subsidies at the end of this year, which were not addressed in the budget bill, and the other regulatory changes being made by the Trump administration, the Republican policy agenda could lead to an estimated 17 million Americans losing health coverage over the next decade, according to the health policy think tank KFF.

Fewer people with health insurance is going to mean fewer people getting medical services, which means more illness and ultimately more deaths. 

One recent analysis by a group of Harvard-affiliated researchers of the House Republicans' version of the budget bill (which included the same general outline, though some of the provisions have been tweaked in the Senate) concluded that 700,000 fewer Americans would have a regular place to get medical care as a result of the bill. Upward of 200,000 fewer people would get their blood cholesterol or blood sugar checked; 139,000 fewer women would get their recommended mammograms. Overall, the authors project that between 8,200 and 24,600 additional Americans would die every year under the Republican plan. Other analyses came to the same conclusion: Millions of Americans will lose health insurance and thousands will die.

After a painful legislative debate in which some of their own members warned them not to cut Medicaid too deeply, Republicans succeeded in taking a big chunk out of the program to help cover the costs of their bill's tax cuts. They have, eight years after failing to repeal Obamacare entirely, managed to strike blows to some of its important provisions.

So, for better or worse, they own the health care system now, a system that is a continued source of frustration for most Americans — frustrations that the Republican plan won't relieve. The next time health care comes up for serious debate in Congress, lawmakers will need to repair the damage that the GOP is doing with its so-called big, beautiful bill.

The effects of the budget bill won't be limited only to the people on Medicaid and the people whose private insurance costs will increase because of the Obamacare funding cuts. Everyone will experience the consequences of millions of Americans losing health coverage.

When a person loses their health insurance, they are more likely to skip regular medical checkups, which makes it more likely they go to a hospital emergency room when a serious medical problem has gotten so bad that they can't ignore it any longer. The hospital is obligated by federal law to take care of them even if they can't pay for their care.

Those costs are then passed on to other patients. When health care providers negotiate with insurance companies over next year's rates, they account for the uncompensated care they have to provide. And the fewer people covered by Medicaid, the more uncompensated care hospitals have to cover, the more costs are going to increase for even people who do have health insurance. Republicans included funding in the bill to try to protect hospitals from the adverse consequences, an acknowledgement of the risk they were taking, but the hospitals themselves are warning that the funding patches are insufficient. If hospitals and doctors' offices close because their bottom lines are squeezed by this bill, that will make it harder for people to access health care, even if they have an insurance card.

The effects of the Republican budget bill are going to filter through the rest of the health care system and increase costs for everyone. In that sense, the legislation passage marks a new era for US health policy. Since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, Democrats have primarily been held responsible for the state of the health care system. Sometimes this has been a drag on their political goals. But over time, as the ACA's benefits became more ingrained, health care became a political boon to Democrats.

Going forward, having made these enormous changes, Republicans are going to own the American health care system and all of its problems — the ones they created and the ones that have existed for years.

For the past decade-plus, US health care politics have tended to follow a “you break it, you buy it” rule. Democrats discovered this in 2010: Though the Affordable Care Act's major provisions did not take effect for several years, they saw their popularity plummet quickly as Republicans successfully blamed annual premium increases that would've occurred with or without the law on the Democrats and their new health care bill. Voters were persuaded by those arguments, and Democrats lost Congress in the 2010 midterms. 

But years later, Americans began to change their perception. As of 2024, 44 million Americans were covered through the 2010 health care law and two-thirds of the country say they have a favorable view of the ACA. After the GOP's failed attempt to repeal the law in 2017, the politics of the issue flipped: Democrats scored major wins in the 2018 midterms after successfully campaigning against the GOP's failed plan to repeal the ACA. Even in the disastrous 2024 election cycle for Democrats, health care policy was still an issue where voters trusted Kamala Harris more than Trump.

Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill is already unpopular. Medicaid cuts specifically do not poll well with the public, and the program itself is enjoying the most popularity ever since it was first created in 1965. Those are the ingredients for a serious backlash, especially with government officials and hospitals in red states railing hard against the bill.

Democrats have more work to do on explaining to the public what the bill does and how its implications will be felt by millions of people. Recent polling suggests that many Americans don't understand the specifics. A contentious debate among Republicans, with several solitary members warning against the consequences of Medicaid cuts, have given politicians on the other side of the aisle good material to work with in making that case: Democrats can pull up clips of Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) on the Senate floor, explaining how devastating the bill's Medicaid provisions would be to conservative voters in Republican-controlled states. 

Republicans will try to sell the bill on its tax cuts. But multiple analyses have shown the vast majority of the benefits are going to be reserved for people in higher-income brackets. Middle-class and working-class voters will see only marginal tax relief — and if their health care costs increase either because they lose their insurance or because their premiums go up after other people lose insurance, then that relief could quickly be wiped out by increased costs elsewhere. That is the story Democrats will need to tell in the coming campaigns.

Medicaid has served as a safety net for tens of millions of Americans during both the Great Recession of 2008 and since the pandemic recession of 2020. At one point, around 90 million Americans — about one in four — were covered by Medicaid. People have become much more familiar with the program and it has either directly benefited them or helped somebody that they know at a difficult time.

And difficult times may be coming. Economists have their eyes on concerning economic indicators that the world may be heading toward a recession. When a recession hits — that is, after all, inevitable; it's just the normal cycle of the economy — people will lose their jobs and many of them will also lose their employer-sponsored health insurance. But now, the safety net is far flimsier than it was in previous crises. 

Republicans are going to own those consequences. They took a program that had become an essential lifeline for millions of Americans and having schemed to gut the law ever since the Democrats expanded Medicaid through the ACA more than a decade ago, have finally succeeded. This Republican plan was a reaction to their opponent's most recent policy overhaul; the next Democratic health care plan will need to repair the harms precipitated by the GOP budget bill.

In the meantime, the impetus is on Democrats and truth tellers in the media to help Americans understand what has happened, why it has happened, and what the fallout is going to be.

Sometime last year, Ian Lamont's inbox began piling up with inquiries about a job listing. The Boston-based owner of a how-to guide company hadn't opened any new positions, but when he logged onto LinkedIn, he found one for a ""Data Entry Clerk"" linked to his business's name and logo.

Lamont soon realized his brand was being scammed, which he confirmed when he came across the profile of someone purporting to be his company's ""manager."" The account had fewer than a dozen connections and an AI-generated face. He spent the next few days warning visitors to his company's site about the scam and convincing LinkedIn to take down the fake profile and listing. By then, more than twenty people reached out to him directly about the job, and he suspects many more had applied.

Generative AI's potential to bolster business is staggering. According to one 2023 estimate from McKinsey, in the coming years it's expected to add more value to the global economy annually than the entire GDP of the United Kingdom. At the same time, GenAI's ability to almost instantaneously produce authentic-seeming content at mass scale has created the equally staggering potential to harm businesses.

Since ChatGPT's debut in 2022, online businesses have had to navigate a rapidly expanding deepfake economy, where it's increasingly difficult to discern whether any text, call, or email is real or a scam. In the past year alone, GenAI-enabled scams have quadrupled, according to the scam reporting platform Chainabuse. In a Nationwide insurance survey of small business owners last fall, a quarter reported having faced at least one AI scam in the past year. Microsoft says it now shuts down nearly 1.6 million bot-based signup attempts every hour. Renée DiResta, who researches online adversarial abuse at Georgetown University, tells me she calls the GenAI boom the ""industrial revolution for scams"" — as it automates frauds, lowers barriers to entry, reduces costs, and increases access to targets.

The consequences of falling for an AI-manipulated scam can be devastating. Last year, a finance clerk at the engineering firm Arup joined a video call with whom he believed were his colleagues. It turned out that each of the attendees was a deepfake recreation of a real coworker, including the organization's chief financial officer. The fraudsters asked the clerk to approve overseas transfers amounting to more than $25 million, and assuming the request came through the CFO, he green-lit the transaction.

Business Insider spoke with professionals in several industries — including recruitment, graphic design, publishing, and healthcare — who are scrambling to keep themselves and their customers safe against AI's ever-evolving threats. Many feel like they're playing an endless game of whack-a-mole, and the moles are only multiplying and getting more cunning.

Last year, fraudsters used AI to build a French-language replica of the online Japanese knives store Oishya, and sent automated scam offers to the company's 10,000-plus followers on Instagram. The fake company told customers of the real company they had won a free knife and that all they had to do was pay a small shipping fee to claim it — and nearly 100 people fell for it. Kamila Hankiewicz, who has run Oishya for nine years, learned about the scam only after several victims contacted her asking how long they needed to wait for the parcel to arrive.

It was a rude awakening for Hankiewicz. She's since ramped up the company's cybersecurity and now runs campaigns to teach customers how to spot fake communications. Though many of her customers were upset about getting defrauded, Hankiewicz helped them file reports with their financial institutions for refunds. Rattling as the experience was, ""the incident actually strengthened our relationship with many customers who appreciated our proactive approach,"" she says.

Rob Duncan, the VP of strategy at the cybersecurity firm Netcraft, isn't surprised at the surge in personalized phishing attacks against small businesses like Oishya. GenAI tools now allow even a novice lone wolf with little technical know-how to clone a brand's image and write flawless, convincing scam messages within minutes, he says. With cheap tools, ""attackers can more easily spoof employees, fool customers, or impersonate partners across multiple channels,"" Duncan says.

Though mainstream AI tools like ChatGPT have precautions in place when you ask them to infringe copyright, there are now plenty of free or inexpensive online services that allow users to replicate a business's website with simple text prompts. Using a tool called Llama Press, I was able to produce a near-exact clone of Hankiewicz's store, and personalize it from a few words of instructions. (Kody Kendall, Llama Press's founder, says cloning a store like Oshiya's doesn't trigger a safety block because there can be legitimate reasons to do so, like when a business owner is trying to migrate their website to a new hosting platform. He adds that Llama Press relies on Anthropic's and OpenAI's built-in safety checks to weed out bad-faith requests.)

Text is just one front of the war businesses are fighting against malicious uses of AI. With the latest tools, it takes a solo adversary — again with no technical expertise — as little as an hour to create a convincing fake job candidate to attend a video interview.

Tatiana Becker, a tech recruiter based in New York, tells me deepfake job candidates have become an ""epidemic."" Over the past couple years, she has had to frequently reject scam applicants who use deepfake avatars to cheat on interviews. At this point, she's able to discern some of their telltale signs of fakery, including a glitchy video quality and the candidate's refusal to switch up any element of their appearance during the call, such as taking off their headphones. Now, at the start of every interview she asks for the candidates' ID and poses more open-ended questions, like what they like to do in their free time, to suss out if they're a human. Ironically, she's made herself more robotic at the outset of interviews to sniff out the robots.

Nicole Yelland, a PR executive, says she found herself on the opposite end of deepfakery earlier this year. A scammer impersonating a startup recruiter approached her over email saying he was looking for a head of comms, with an offer package that included generous pay and benefits. The purported person even shared with her an exhaustive slide deck, decorated with AI-generated visuals, outlining the role's responsibilities and benefits. Enticed, she scheduled an interview.

During the video meeting, however, the ""hiring manager"" refused to speak, and instead asked Yelland to type her responses to the written questions in the Microsoft Teams chat section. Her alarm bells really went off once the interviewer started asking her to share a series of private documents, including her driver's license.

Yelland now runs a background check with tools like Spokeo before engaging with any stranger online. ""It's annoying and takes more time, but engaging with a spammer is more annoying and time-consuming; so this is where we are,"" she says.

While videoconferencing platforms like Teams and Zoom are getting better at detecting AI-generated accounts, some experts say the detection itself risks creating an vicious cycle. The data these platforms collect on what's fake is ultimately used to train more sophisticated GenAI models, which will help them get better at escaping fakery detectors and fuel ""an arms race defenders cannot win,"" says Jasson Casey, the CEO of Beyond Identity, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in identity theft. Casey and his company believe the focus should instead be on authenticating a person's identity. Beyond Identity sells tools that can be plugged into Zoom that verify meeting participants through their device's biometrics and location data. If it detects a discrepancy, the tools label the participants' video feed as ""unverified."" Tramèr Florian, a computer science professor at ETH Zurich, agrees that authenticating identity will likely become more essential to ensure that you're always talking to a legitimate colleague.

It's not just fake job candidates entrepreneurs now have to contend with, it's always fake versions of themselves. In late 2024, scammers ran ads on Facebook for a video featuring Jonathan Shaw, the deputy director of the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne. Although the person in it looked and sounded exactly like Dr. Shaw, the voice had been deepfaked and edited to say that metformin — a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes — is ""dangerous,"" and patients should instead switch to an unproven dietary supplement. The fake ad was accompanied by a fake written news interview with Shaw.

Several of his clinic's patients, believing the video was genuine, reached out asking how to get a hold of the supplement. ""One of my longstanding patients asked me how come I continued to prescribe metformin to him, when 'I' had said on the video that it was a poor drug,"" Shaw tells me. Eventually he was able to get Facebook to take down the video.

Then there's the equally vexing and annoying issue of AI slop — an inundation of low-quality, mass-produced images and text that is flooding the internet and making it ever-more difficult for the average person to tell what's real or fake. In her research, DiResta found instances where social platforms' recommendation engines have promoted malicious slop — where scammers would put up images of items like nonexistent rental properties, appliances, and more that users were frequently falling for it and giving away their payment details.

On Pinterest, AI-generated ""inspo"" posts have plagued people's mood boards — so much so that Philadelphia-based Cake Life Shop now often receives orders from customers asking them to recreate what are actually AI-generated cakes. In one shared with Business Insider, the cake resembles a moss-filled rainforest, and features a functional waterfall. Thankfully for cofounder Nima Etemadi, most customers are ""receptive to hearing about what is possible with real cake after we burst their AI bubble,"" he says.

Similarly, AI-generated books have swarmed Amazon and are now hurting publisher sales.

Pauline Frommer, the president of the travel guide publisher Frommer Media, says that AI-generated guidebooks have managed to reach the top of lists with the help of fake reviews. An AI publisher buys a few Prime memberships, sets the guidebook's ebook price to zero, and then leaves seemingly ""verified reviews"" by downloading its copies for free. These practices, she says, ""will make it virtually impossible for a new, legitimate brand of guidebook to enter the business right now."" Ian Lamont says he received an AI-generated guidebook as a gift last year: a text-only guide to Taiwan, with no pictures or maps.

While the FTC now considers it illegal to publish fake, AI-generated product reviews, official policies haven't yet caught up with AI-generated content itself. Platforms like Pinterest and Google have started to watermark and label AI-generated posts, but since it's not error-free yet, some worry these measures may do more harm than good. DiResta fears that a potential unintended consequence of ubiquitous AI labels would be people experiencing ""label fatigue,"" where they blindly assume that unlabeled content is therefore always ""real."" ""It's a potentially dangerous assumption if a sophisticated manipulator, like a state actor's intelligence service, manages to get disinformation content past a labeler,"" she says.

For now, small business owners should stay vigilant, says Robin Pugh, the executive director of Intelligence for Good, a non-profit that helps victims of internet-enabled crimes. They should always validate they're dealing with an actual human and that the money they're sending is actually going where they intend it to go.

Etemadi of Cake Life Shop recognizes that for as much as GenAI can help his business become more efficient, scam artists will ultimately use the same tools to become just as efficient. ""Doing business online gets more necessary and high risk every year,"" he says. ""AI is just part of that.""

The Justice Department said on Monday that it had seized hundreds of computers and accused 13 people of tricking US companies into paying salaries to North Korea.

In a new indictment filed in Massachusetts federal court, prosecutors alleged that conspirators fooled over 100 American firms in Washington, D.C., and 27 states.

These firms weren't named, but authorities said they include Fortune 500 companies and a defense contractor in California with access to sensitive military technology files.

Investigators detailed an elaborate scheme where at least two US citizens worked with North Korean state actors from 2021 to 2024 to steal identities, use them to get people hired in American industries, and then siphon their salaries to Pyongyang.

""These schemes target and steal from US companies and are designed to evade sanctions and fund the North Korean regime's illicit programs, including its weapons programs,"" John Eisenberg, assistant attorney general in the National Security Division, said in a Monday statement.

First, the conspirators used online background check services to obtain the personal data of over 80 Americans, the Justice Department said.

Using that data, they created fake identities for a network of Chinese and Taiwanese people who lived outside America but posed as US-based IT workers or software engineers looking for remote jobs.

Authorities said that once hired, the scammers would ask their employers to send work laptops to homes in New Jersey, New York, and California.

But these homes were actually ""laptop farms,"" where the computers were plugged into hard drives that gave user access to IT workers in North Korea, per the Justice Department.

At least 29 suspected laptop farms in 16 states were raided by US law enforcement, the department said in its statement.

Prosecutors alleged that Wang Zhengxing, one of the US citizens named in the indictment, hosted one of such laptop farm and created shell companies, such as a fake ""VC-backed startup"" called Tony WKJ, to receive the fake workers' salaries.

The money was then sent to North Korea-controlled accounts. Wang has been arrested and faces charges in the five-count indictment, alongside eight other Chinese and Taiwanese citizens. The other US citizen named in court documents, Kejia Wang, is at large.

The Justice Department said both men and four other unnamed partners working in the US received at least $696,000 in total from North Korea for their services.

Four North Koreans were named in a separate criminal indictment filed in the Northern District Court of Georgia, which accused them of posing as US-based workers and laundering their salaries.

They're also accused of stealing data and cryptocurrency from their employers, then lying about the theft.

""How many times do I need to tell you??? I didn't do it!!! It's not me!!!"" one of the fake workers wrote in a Telegram message to one of these companies in 2022, per the Justice Department.

The US has been trying to crack down on what it warns is a wide-scale, concerted effort by North Korea to dupe American firms into hiring its IT workers to fund Pyongyang's government.

For years, the FBI and the Justice Department have said the fraud could involve thousands of North Korean workers farming millions of dollars for weapons and missile programs.

Other major indictments include the charging of an Arizona woman who was accused in May 2024 of helping North Koreans find work with over 300 companies in the US.

The five-year-old company, known for its bold designs, unveiled the Phone 3 and a pair of similarly quirky headphones.

The Phone 3 is, by design, a weird gadget. A see-through back reveals the printed circuit board inside. And there's a small circular display with retro-style animations — an hourglass, for example, is meant to tell you in the cutest way possible that your Uber is arriving.

It's odd looking, no doubt, but the strangest thing about it is that it's designed to be used less than other phones.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Jumia Technologies AG, the biggest e-commerce company in Africa, has drawn takeover interest from telecommunications company Axian Telecom, people familiar with the matter said. 

Axian, which is based in Mauritius and primarily offers telecommunications services in Africa, raised $600 million this week to refinance its debt and help fund a possible takeover of Jumia, the people said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are private. No final decisions have been made and the companies may not come to an agreement, they said. Jumia has a market value of about $500 million.

On June 20, nearly three weeks into the Atlantic hurricane season, Florida disaster-management officials assembled a group of emergency relief contractors in Tallahassee and asked them to do something they had never done before. 

Governor Ron DeSantis wanted to construct a camp in the Everglades that could hold thousands of immigrants detained in President Donald Trump's deportation campaign. To get it built fast, Kevin Guthrie, the head of the state's emergency-management division, asked the firms to start moving tents, trailers and toilets onto an abandoned airstrip near Miami within days.

A federal judge on Tuesday blocked the Trump administration from moving forward with plans to overhaul the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services by reorganizing several of its agencies and substantially cutting their workforce.

U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose in Providence, Rhode Island, issued an injunction at the behest of a group of Democratic-led states who challenged a plan HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in March to consolidate agencies and fire 10,000 of the department's employees.

The layoffs, in addition to earlier buyout offers and firings of probationary employees, reduced the number of full-time HHS employees to 62,000 from 82,000 and left key offices unable to perform statutory functions, the states alleged.

The 19 states that sued, along with the District of Columbia, challenged HHS' implementation of its restructuring plan, which also called for collapsing 28 divisions into 15 and closing half of its 10 regional offices.

While the states argued that the entire plan was unlawful, they focused on having DuBose block firings and restructurings at four agencies within HHS, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Office of Head Start.

DuBose, an appointee of Democratic President Joe Biden, agreed to do so, saying the states had established a likelihood of proving HHS' action was arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary to law.

""The Executive Branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,"" she wrote.

She ordered HHS to halt mass job cuts and restructurings at the four agencies, which also included the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Center for Tobacco Products and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.

""Today's order guarantees these programs and services will remain accessible and halts the administration's attempt to sabotage our nation's health care system,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, said in a statement.

HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said it strongly disagreed with the ruling and stands by its decision to ""refocus a sprawling bureaucracy that, over time, had become wasteful, inefficient, and resistant to change.""

The ruling came a day before the terminations of the employees were set to become final. Some of the 10,000 employees had already been reinstated following an outcry over the potential for increased risks to public health.

The job cuts were part of the effort by Republican President Donald Trump and the Elon Musk-spearheaded Department of Government Efficiency initiative to shrink the federal government and slash spending.

Democratic state attorneys general in a lawsuit filed in May argued that the intended effect of the restructuring was to dismantle key HHS programs.

They argued that Kennedy lacked the authority to launch the widespread layoffs and restructuring, which have led to infectious disease lab closures, research being abandoned and partnerships suspended.

The states said that the cuts left the CDC unable to meet statutory mandates to investigate diseases due to lab closures and put Head Start centers that support early childhood programs at risk of closing.

The Senate on Tuesday passed President Donald Trump's megabill after days of negotiations and a marathon amendment session that at times appeared to imperil the domestic policy package.

The final vote was 51-50, with Vice President JD Vance casting a final, tie-breaking vote. Republican Sens. Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, Rand Paul, of Kentucky, and Susan Collins, of Maine, all broke with their party and voted against the massive spending bill.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune's victory in the upper chamber may be short-lived, however, as the megabill now goes to the House, where it faces an uncertain future amid firm GOP hold-outs.

The House, which just squeaked out its version of the bill, must accept the Senate's substantial changes to the package, which is a daunting task, especially as some GOP lawmakers have expressed continued concerns over the bill's impact on the deficit.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects the bill will add at least $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.

Some House Republicans reluctantly voted for the package in May, and now, with the Senate changes, which include deeper Medicaid cuts, some lawmakers are showing continued resistance.

With his narrow majority, House Speaker Mike Johnson can afford to lose only three votes in his chamber to pass the legislation in a party-line vote.

Still, Republican senators are hailing the vote passage in their chamber as a victory, following a weekend session of work and a record-breaking vote-a-rama, which lasted 24 hours.

Senators voted on dozens of amendments to the bill in the marathon session.

Behind the scenes, GOP leaders have been negotiating with holdouts in their conference who, for days, threatened to sink Trump's bill.

Ultimately, none of the amendments fundamentally changed the bill, but Democrats seized on the process to force their GOP colleagues to go on the record on some politically tenuous positions.

As the bill heads back to the House, lawmakers are rushing to try to get the package to Trump's desk before a self-imposed July 4 deadline.

The package, which seeks to codify Trump's sweeping domestic policy agenda, faces a tenuous path in the lower chamber.

Hard-line conservative House members, such as Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, have voiced frustration over what they view as the Senate using the July 4 deadline to force a vote in the lower chamber, despite persistent opposition. 

""Rumor is Senate plans to jam the House with its weaker, unacceptable OBBB before 7/4,"" Roy wrote on X on Thursday, referring to the legislation, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was renamed right before the vote.

""This is not a surprise but it would be a mistake,"" Roy said, adding that he ""would not vote for it as it is.""

The Senate passage comes as Trump last week ramped up his pressure campaign on lawmakers to pass the bill before July 4, increasing the stakes of the self-imposed deadline. 

""To my friends in the Senate, lock yourself in a room if you must, don't go home, and GET THE DEAL DONE THIS WEEK,"" he wrote on Truth Social.

Workers across the United States are getting a raise this week after minimum wage increases took effect across several states and localities Tuesday.

The wage increases are expected to affect more than 880,000 workers this summer as minimum wage laws take effect in areas including Alaska, Oregon, Washington, D.C. and certain cities in California and Washington state, according to a report by The Economic Policy Institute.

In Everett, Washington, a city just north of Seattle, companies with more than 500 employees are now required to pay a minimum of $20.24 an hour. In Alaska, the statewide minimum wage is now $13.00 an hour, up from $11.91 — meaning a full-time, year-round worker in Alaska will receive an average annual wage increase of $925, according to the report.

Nationally, the federal minimum wage has remained at $7.25 an hour since 2009, but in many areas, state and local governments have enacted higher minimums.

A full-time worker in every U.S. county would need to earn at least $17 an hour to afford basic expenses such as housing, food, transportation and health care, according to The Economic Policy Institute's family budget calculator.

Do you want a job you love, at a company you love, with values you love? Of course you do. That's the dream for just about everyone. And frankly, companies want the same thing. When employee values align with company values, you get engagement and retention. It's a win-win.

A desire for this ""glove-like"" fit is why so many MBA students enroll in my class at NYU Stern School of Business. It's called ""Becoming You,"" and its goal is to help graduates find a job aligned with their purpose. But here's the problem — and it's a big one: Most people know their aptitudes and interests. But their values? Not so much.

My research shows that only about 7% of adults know their values with real clarity. And worse, most don't know how to identify a company's real values, either. Not the ones in the brochure. The real ones.

Nearly every company will say it values empowerment, innovation, and excellence. But let's be honest: Those are just platitudes. The truth is, values aren't what a company says it believes. Values are how work really gets done.

Ask directly, and you'll usually get those same vague buzzwords. So you'll need to do some sleuthing.

And that's where the job interview comes in. There's one question that cuts through the BS: ""What kind of person should not work at this company?""

People who ask it are usually stunned. It almost always catches managers off guard, but that's exactly why it works. Because the answers are often more honest, less rehearsed, and far more revealing.

Here are some real responses my students have heard:

Now we're getting somewhere. These answers reveal true values — in high relief.

Take that first one: ""A person who doesn't want to text on weekends."" That company might claim it respects boundaries and employee well-being. But this answer tells a different story.

Or, ""A person who's too social."" Translation: ""We prize focus and independence. Community? Not so much.""

I'm not saying any of those values are wrong — unless they're wrong for you.

Keep in mind that this question is best saved for the end of your interview process, ideally after you've received an offer. Why? Because it can be so disarming to hiring managers that you want to make sure you have good rapport with them before you launch it.

And since this question can make people get a little defensive, it has to be delivered with just the right tone. You need to sound pleasantly curious, not investigative, even though indeed, you are being a little bit investigative.

You can get a ranked list of your core values by taking ""The Values Bridge,"" a test I developed with my team. When I started teaching at NYU Stern in 2021, building an assessment tool was not on my to-do list. But the seven values exercises I was using in class weren't giving students the precision they needed.

People kept confusing values with virtues, despite my best efforts. Virtues are broadly agreed-upon ideals: Fairness, Integrity, Honesty. We all endorse them. But values? They're different. Values are choices — about how we want to live and work. They're not good or bad, just right or wrong for you.

Take the value of Scope, for example. People with high Scope want stimulation: learning, adventure, novelty. Low Scope individuals seek calm, predictability, and peace.

There are 15 values in total — like Affluence, Familycentrism, Achievement, and Radius. You can test for all of them — and you should. Especially if you're job hunting. Because once you know your values, you can assess if a company shares them.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Strategy Set To Post $13B Bitcoin Gains, But Revenue Stalls","https://cointelegraph.com/news/strategy-q2-13b-bitcoin-gains-revenue-stalls","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 17:47:33 GMT","

 Michael Saylor's tech company is expected to post over $13 billion in unrealized gains from its Bitcoin holdings in the second quarter of 2025. 

Strategy, the world's largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, is expected to post mixed financials for the second quarter of 2025. 

According to a Bloomberg analysis on Tuesday, the company is projected to report more than $13 billion in unrealized gains for 2Q 2025, driven by its massive crypto holdings. In stark contrast, its core software business is forecast to generate just $112.8 million in revenue, reflecting a widening gap between its digital asset exposure and operational performance.

Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that Strategy held 528,185 Bitcoin (BTC) as of Mar. 31, worth over $43.5 billion at the time. The company's holdings stood at $56.3 billion Monday, resulting in an unrealized gain of $12.8 billion during the past three months.

A wave of companies has followed Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor's lead in adding Bitcoin to their assets as the cryptocurrency's price has increased. As Cointelegraph reported, 250 businesses now hold Bitcoin, with 26 announcing BTC treasury strategies in June.

Additional profits from Strategy's weekly BTC purchases resulted in another 9% in unrealized gains, or $640 million. According to US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, Strategy purchased the tokens for an average price of $97,900 during the period. 

An unrealized gain refers to the increase in the value of an asset that a company or investor still holds but hasn't yet sold. It reflects the potential profit based on current market prices, not actual cash earned. 

Despite a 6% drop on Tuesday, Strategy's stock price has soared more than 170% over the past year on the Nasdaq, according to TradingView data.

In a Tuesday X post, Saylor said the company generated a Bitcoin yield of 7.8% in the second quarter of this year. The Bitcoin yield is the company's own performance metric, measuring the percentage change in Bitcoin per assumed diluted share.

Strategy has been pushing its Bitcoin strategy in 2025 through weekly purchases. The company acquired 4,980 Bitcoin in late June. 

A week earlier, the company disclosed another 245 Bitcoin acquisition for $26 million. This follows the firm's purchase of 705 Bitcoin for $75.1 million between May 26 and 30.

Strategy is financing its Bitcoin purchases through a mix of debt, equity, and preferred stock offerings, an approach that some analysts had labeled as “highly accretive,” while others warn of shareholder dilution.

BitMine Immersion Technologies said it has raised roughly $250 million in a private placement, selling about 55.56 million new shares at $4.50 apiece. The proceeds, funded in cash and cryptocurrencies, will be used to accumulate ether and make the digital asset the company's primary treasury reserve. The round was led by investment firm MOZAYYX with backing from Founders Fund, Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital and other crypto-focused investors.



Concurrently, BitMine appointed Wall Street strategist and Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee as chairman of the board. Lee likened the plan to MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy, arguing that Ethereum should benefit from the rapid growth of stablecoins and other on-chain applications. The company intends to track the amount of ETH held per share as a key performance metric and may add to the position through future capital-markets activity and reinvested cash flow.



Investors cheered the announcement: BitMine's lightly traded shares surged as much as 400% to about $23.35 on Monday, lifting the firm's market value well above its prior roughly $26 million capitalization. The move underscores a growing trend among small publicly traded firms turning to ether, rather than bitcoin, to diversify corporate treasuries and tap into broader crypto-financial applications.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Ethereum's recent market behavior has been characterized by indecision, with mixed signals across various timeframes. This uncertainty has led to a search for clear direction in the market. Despite this, there are indications of a bullish setup, particularly as Bitcoin and BTC dominance show strength, which could benefit Ethereum in the near term. The next major resistance level for Ethereum is marked at $2,800.

Across key timeframes, Ethereum's performance has been mixed. The monthly candle ended indecisively, suggesting short-term hesitation, while the quarterly candle closed with strong bullish conviction. This sets the stage for potential upward movement in the coming months as higher timeframes begin to assert dominance. The daily candles for both ETH and ETHBTC also closed indecisively, reflecting the current market uncertainty. However, with Bitcoin dominance starting to decline, there is potential for ETHBTC to gain strength, which could fuel Ethereum's next leg up.

ETHBTC is already showing signs of life, moving upward from a monthly double-bottom formation. Clean, bullish candles forming from the 0.02270 BTC region could inject fresh momentum into Ethereum, helping to drive it toward the $2,800 resistance. Unless there are negative fundamental developments, $2,400 remains Ethereum's main daily support zone. As long as this holds, the broader structure remains intact, and the bullish thesis stays valid.

Looking ahead, attention will be focused on the lower timeframes. With volatility in play and setups brewing, there will be close monitoring for quick scalp opportunities as Ethereum navigates through this critical range. Ethereum's intraday chart experienced heightened volatility throughout the day. Despite the choppy price action, clear setups are forming that could present solid trading opportunities in the near term.

A decisive breakout and close above the $2,550 resistance level would be a strong bullish signal, potentially opening the door for a long entry. On the flip side, if the price pulls back toward the $2,380 support and forms a bullish reversal pattern, that too could serve as a valid trigger for a long position. With these scenarios in mind, the focus will be on spotting a clean and high-quality setup that aligns with price structure and momentum to time the next scalp trade effectively.

A crypto analyst has forecasted a powerful Wave 3 Bitcoin price rally that could take it toward new all-time highs between $160,000 and $200,000. Notably, this surge is expected to come with rising Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) and a delayed altcoin season, particularly if BTC can make a clean break above the $108,500 resistance level. 

Bitcoin Price Breakout To Spark Next Bull Run

The Bitcoin price is currently hovering below a critical resistance level at $108,500, and according to a crypto analyst known as ‘BigMike7335' on the X social media platform, a clean breakout and flip of this level into support could ignite an explosive Wave 3 bull run. Based on Elliott Wave Theory and Fibonacci Extension analysis, a successful move above this threshold could open the door to a bullish price surge with potential targets set in the $160,000 to $200,000 range.

The analyst's chart shows that Bitcoin has already completed its Wave 1 of a five-wave impulse move, followed by an ABC corrective Wave 2. The market is also currently consolidating, and Bitcoin's bullish momentum appears to be rebuilding. These positive developments are supported by a rising Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) from the oversold region and a neutral-to-bullish RSI, both of which point toward upward price action.

Notably, the 0.618 and 1.0 Fibonacci Extensions around $117,795 and $137,421, respectively, are highlighted as interim resistance zones where price momentum could temporarily slow before continuing upward. A clean breakout above $108,500 could also place Bitcoin above a heavy volume node visible in the volume profile within the chart, suggesting less overhead resistance and a stronger potential for a price rally. 

Furthermore, the analysis implies that during this powerful Wave 3 phase, Bitcoin Dominance will likely climb toward 70%. This increase in BTC.D would mean capital is concentrating in the leading cryptocurrency, which historically results in altcoins underperforming. As a result, the expected altcoin season for this cycle may be postponed, following the completion or cooling of Wave 3. 

Analyst Predicts $375,000 Bitcoin Bull Run Peak

Crypto analyst TechDave has just sounded the alarm on what he calls the Bitcoin “launch signal”, a rare trigger that has only appeared four times in history and each time marked the start of major bull market rallies. This signal previously appeared in October 2012, July 2016, and July 2020—all preceding major upward moves that ended in new cycle peaks. 

Currently, the same signal is emerging this July, aligning with the previous cycle structures and reinforcing the expectation of a breakout phase. Notably, the formation has led to exponential gains, with each bull market run typically peaking months later. Following this historical pattern, TechDave now predicts a fresh cycle top for Bitcoin at $375,000.

By Isabella Flores

Key Takeaways:

Four North Korean citizens have been accused by federal prosecutors of taking part in a currency theft that stole almost $1 million in cryptocurrency from two cryptocurrency companies in a complex, rolling series of online attacks. Prosecutors say the defendants seized on the growth of remote work and cryptocurrency development to duck sanctions and funnel digital assets to the North Korean government.



The indictment, filed in the Northern District of Georgia on June 30, 2025, details a scam that ran from at least 2019 to somewhere in 2022, with multiple crypto heists in that span of time. The defendants—Kim Kwang Jin, Kang Tae Bok, Jong Pong Ju, and Chang Nam Il—used fake and stolen identities to secure jobs as developers at blockchain firms located in the U.S. and Serbia.

Court records reveal that Kim and Jong were hired as developers by a Georgia-based blockchain R&D company and a Serbia-based virtual token firm, respectively. They applied under fabricated profiles that included fraudulent documentation, mixing real and stolen identity details. Neither company was aware of the applicants' true North Korean nationality at the time of hiring.

The operation reportedly began with the group working together in the United Arab Emirates in 2019, where they first coordinated their skills and planned how to target crypto platforms abroad.

Once inside those jobs, the agents had access to sensitive inside systems and the company's crypto wallets. Jong Pong Ju, a k a “Bryan Cho,” had taken approximately $175,000 in digital currency out of his employer's bank account in February 2022. A month later, Kim Kwang Jin preyed on the flaws in the company's smart contract code, making off with nearly $740,000 of crypto assets.

Prosecutors said both thefts were premeditated and used code modifications and inward permissions to obscure the unauthorized transactions. The stolen money was laundered through a digital currency mixing service to hide its origins, after which it was transferred to exchange accounts opened with forged Malaysian identity documents.

These exchange accounts were managed by Kang Tae Bok and Chang Nam Il, other co-conspirators who also laundered the proceeds from the stolen money. All four were named in a five-count indictment, including wire fraud and money laundering charges.

U.S. Attorney Theodore S. Hertzberg emphasized that the case reflects a growing and calculated threat from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), which uses IT operatives globally to circumvent sanctions and raise funds for state-run programs—including nuclear weapons development.

“These individuals masked their true identities, exploited employer trust, and stole nearly a million dollars—all to support an authoritarian regime,” said Hertzberg. “We will continue to pursue any actor, domestic or foreign, who targets U.S. businesses.”

The FBI Atlanta division, which spearheaded the investigation, echoed these concerns. Special Agent in Charge Paul Brown said the DPRK's use of fraudulent identities to breach blockchain companies highlights the distinct intersection between cyber security, national security, and financial crime.

This case is not isolated. It is part of a broader pattern of North Korea's operatives using crypto infrastructure to exploit international controls. On the domestic DOJ enabler-crossfire front, the DOJ is engaged in the public relations effort known as DPRK RevGen: Domestic Enabler Initiative, an offensive launched in March 2024 by the National Security Division of the DOJ, the initiative to terminate these online virtual currency-based money-laundering pathways on the foreign and the U.S. side.



Authorities said the scam was part of a wider drive to form “revenue generation networks” that ultimately contribute to North Korea's strategic budget. These include high-profile cyberattacks, ransomware deployments, and now—direct infiltration into corporate teams through remote employment.

Andrew Fierman, head of national security at blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis, commented that DPRK actors are increasingly embedding themselves within target firms:

“They gather internal knowledge, manipulate systems from within, and even orchestrate insider breaches.”

This insider model makes detection harder, especially when paired with advanced laundering techniques such as token mixing and the use of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to layer transactions.

The incident asks some tough questions of the crypto industry, in particular about identity verification, hiring remote, and access control. Although blockchain-based companies put a premium on decentralization and hiring talented staff across the globe, the downside is the heightened exposure to sophisticated fraud.

The stolen funds—worth approximately $915,000 at the time—are still being tracked across exchanges, according to sources familiar with the investigation. The DOJ and FBI are collaborating with international law enforcement and private blockchain analytics firms to recover the assets.

Solana stands out in the crowded blockchain space for a few major reasons.

🔄 Speed and Scalability

Solana uses a special technology called Proof of History (PoH).

It helps the network order transactions quickly — without waiting for blocks.

Combined with Proof of Stake, this system allows Solana to:

For comparison: Ethereum handles around 30 TPS. Solana handles thousands.

 Security and Decentralization

While Solana is fast, it also keeps things secure.

It uses validators across the globe to verify transactions.

These validators stake SOL tokens (Solana's currency) to support the network and earn rewards.

More validators = better security and decentralization.

SOL is the native cryptocurrency of the Solana network.

It powers everything — from transaction fees to staking and smart contracts.

You can use SOL to:

Solana isn't just for sending coins. It's a full platform for building decentralized applications (dApps).

Popular Use Cases:

Solana supports USDC, a stable digital dollar — great for fast payments.

Solana makes it easy for developers to get started.

Developer-Friendly Features:

Growing Ecosystem Includes:

Solana's ecosystem continues to expand, bringing in new users and apps every day

While Solana is powerful, it's not perfect.

Common Criticisms:

However, the team behind Solana is constantly upgrading the system to reduce issues.



Solana is used by a wide mix of users — from crypto enthusiasts to Fortune 500 companies.

Examples:

The more users join, the more powerful and useful the Solana blockchain becomes.

Let's say you're a digital artist.

You want to sell NFTs without paying $50 in gas fees on Ethereum.

Using Solana, you can mint an NFT on Magic Eden for less than a penny — and buyers can trade instantly.

This low cost opens up blockchain use for creators around the world.

Solana is one of the most exciting blockchains today.

Its speed, low cost, and growing community make it ideal for both developers and users.

If you're exploring crypto, dApps, or NFTs — Solana is worth your attention.

About us

Copy link

Plume Network is riding the real-world asset boom. 

Developed by US-based Plume Foundation, Plume is a layer 1 blockchain specialised in real-world assets, or RWAs.

RWAs refer to tangible or traditional financial assets like real estate, commodities, invoices, or bonds that are tokenised and brought onchain to be used within DeFi.

Plume has amassed over $110 million in total value deposited on the chain, a 200% in the past month, according to data from DefiLlama.

Its meteoric rise comes as the total value locked in RWAs having surged to almost $13 billion, according to DefiLlama.

Tokenised assets will grow to a $19 trillion asset class over the next eight years, according to Boston Consulting Group, consulting firm, which prepared the report with crypto company Ripple, the developer of XRP.

To put that into perspective, the entire crypto market is worth almost $3.4 trillion.

I predict the total float of stablecoins will exceed $250 billion by year's end in 2025, driven by increased adoption and the pragmatism of regulators globally

And it's just not the crypto industry who are excited. Anticipation has been building for years.

Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, said two years ago that “the tokenisation of asset classes offers the prospect of driving efficiencies in capital markets, shortening value chains, and improving cost and access for investors.”

In 2024, BlackRock launched BUIDL, its tokenised money market fund, which has drawn in over $1 billion.

Plume has found itself at the centre of a ballooning business opportunity. 

Its mainnet launched on June 5, with a goal to make onchain RWAs feel “just like crypto.”

A mainnet is a blockchain that conducts real transactions with value. Unlike testnets, which are used to test proof-of-concept and attract users, the mainnet is the true blockchain. 

On day one, over 50 protocols were launched on the chain, including major players such as Morpho and Curve. 

Top two leading projects on the blockchain, measured by TVL, are Pell network and DeSyn Protocol, both with just over $53 million in investor deposits, according to data from DefiLlama. Pell is a Bitcoin restaking protocol, while DeSyn provides liquidity for DeFi.

Superstate and Nest Staking, two RWA protocols, have each surpassed $40 million in TVL. Superstate tokenises traditional fixed-income instruments, and Nest Staking focuses on staking mechanisms for RWA protocols.

Since then, over 200 protocols have been deployed on the network. So far, there have been almost 20 million transactions and over 110,000 users on the blockchain. 

According to data CryptoRank.io, Plume leads all blockchains in holders for non-stablecoin RWAs, recently reaching over 100,000. This is second to Ethereum with about 80,000 holders. 

Plume said its goal is to make the RWA process easy and targeted towards crypto investors. They use the term RWAfi, meaning that it wants to turn the traditional onchain RWA process into something more aligned with DeFi.

While metrics are soaring, the token price has not followed suit. It is down 65% from its March 19 high and has a market value of over $210 million. 

On May 29, Plume announced the death of its co-founder, Eugene Shen. The price has slid about 30% since then. 

Plume Foundation didn't respond to a request for comment.

In a move that could weave cryptocurrency more deeply into the fabric of the U.S. payments industry, Circle Internet Group Inc. announced late Monday it has applied to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to form a national trust bank. The application, which seeks to establish what Circle calls the First National Digital Currency Bank N.A., appears to be the first by a front-rank cryptocurrency issuer in the U.S. market and represents the latest move by a digital-currency firm to bring crypto money into mainstream financial services.



If approved, the bank will oversee Circle's management of the reserve for its USDC stablecoin under oversight by the OCC. It will also offer custody services for digital assets offered by institutional customers, Circle says.
The New York City-based company's move to form a bank comes as Congress mulls two bills that seek to regulate the nascent but growing stablecoin business in the U.S. The Genius bill passed the Senate last week and is under consideration in the House of Representatives, which has formulated its own proposed set of rules for the industry, the Stable Act. 




With its own bank, “we will align with emerging U.S. regulation for the issuance and operation of dollar-denominated payment stablecoins, which we believe can enhance the reach and resilience of the U.S. dollar, and support the development of crucial, market neutral infrastructure for the world's leading institutions to build on,” said Jeremy Allaire, Circle's cofounder, chairman, and chief executive, in a statement.



Circle's move to establish a bank is not the first by a digital-currency player, but represents a major step toward establishing stablecoins as a widely used and accepted form of money, observers say. “It's easier for the masses to understand,” says Cliff Gray, proprietor of the payments advisory Gray Consulting.




Still, moves toward forming a bank have been relatively rare among cryptocurrency issuers and exchanges, and the process can take years. Anchorage Digital formed Anchorage Digital Bank in 2021. Paxos applied for a national banking charter in the same year and won conditional approval from the OCC, but its application expired in 2023.



But owning a bank can confer advantages, observers say, particularly with consumers and potential partners. “Crypto does not require an intermediate bank, but if the involvement of a bank makes it more understandable, that's a plus,” notes Gray.

Digital Governance in 50+ issues, 500+ actors, 5+ processes

Home | Updates | South Korea pauses central bank digital currency project

Concerns over costs and unclear commercial plans prompted the Bank of Korea to reconsider its CBDC project. 

South Korea's central bank has paused its second testing phase for a central bank digital currency (CBDC), initially scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2025. Banks in the pilot were told of the temporary halt due to high costs and a lack of a clear commercial plan.

Attention is now shifting towards the regulation and promotion of won-backed stablecoins. The government is fast-tracking legislation under the Digital Asset Basic Act, which would establish licensing, reserve management, and user protection standards for stablecoin issuers.

President Lee Jae-Myung has prioritised developing these digital tokens, aiming to bolster South Korea's monetary sovereignty.

Domestic lawmakers argue that Korean crypto markets are overly dependent on US dollar-pegged stablecoins such as USDT and USDC, which could undermine local financial policy.

Eight central Korean banks, including KB Kookmin, Shinhan, and Woori, have launched a joint effort to issue a won-pegged stablecoin, showing strong commercial interest.

Officials caution that South Korea risks falling behind global competitors in stablecoin innovation without swift regulatory action. The market's potential is seen as vast, possibly surpassing important sectors like AI and semiconductors.

The arrival of clear-sighted crypto regulation has created a unique opportunity for corporate finance, writes Alchemy's Guillaume Poncin.

Guillaume Poncin is the chief technology officer at San Francisco, California-based Alchemy, a blockchain developer platform provider. Views are the author's own.

I recently watched a Fortune 500 CFO's face change when I showed her Circle's numbers: $1.7 billion in revenue last year from investing US Dollar Coin, or USDC, reserves. Coinbase took home nearly $1 billion just for distributing the fast-rising digital currency.

Combined, Circle and Coinbase are monetizing nearly $2 billion in customer float through U.S. Treasuries — the same strategy available to any company holding customer funds. 

After hearing this, the CFO told me: “But we can't touch crypto. Compliance would never approve it.”

She was wrong. And she's not alone.

In early 2025, U.S. financial regulators dismantled the barriers that kept businesses from integrating digital assets. The OCC moved first in March, followed by the FDIC and Federal Reserve in April, collectively withdrawing guidance that had required advance approval for crypto activities. The implications extend far beyond banking: any company with robust compliance infrastructure, from payment processors to corporate treasuries, can now integrate digital assets without regulatory pre-approval. 

In another pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency space, the Senate last month passed a bill aimed at creating a regulatory framework for the issuance of stablecoins. The legislation, dubbed the “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins,” or GENIUS Act, still awaits House approval. The bill, if enacted, is expected to open the door for increased stablecoin adoption by providing much-needed regulatory clarity.

Digital assets have entered mainstream commerce. Corporate treasuries sitting on billions in cash reserves can now access stablecoin yields of 4%-5%, or they can issue their own stablecoin to capture far greater revenue. 

Every day, companies leave money on the table. A consumer goods company pays foreign exchange fees that stablecoins eliminate. A software company pays a significant percentage of sales to payment processors, whereas crypto payments cost less than 1%. Meanwhile, stablecoin issuers are capturing billions from float revenue, which is why PayPal launched PYUSD and why stablecoins processed $35 trillion last year, more than twice Visa's volume. 

The infrastructure already exists; companies just need to tap into it. BlackRock's tokenized money market fund BUIDL crossed $1.7 billion in assets simply by partnering with Securitize for tokenization and firms like Anchorage Digital and BitGo for custody. They didn't build blockchain infrastructure; they leveraged existing providers. 

In light of these trends, the following are tips for corporate finance leaders interested in cryptocurrency adoption:

Digital asset adoption doesn't mean abandoning risk management principles. Consider working with licensed custodians and established infrastructure providers as well as implementing clear governance policies. Also, start with a conservative approach. Begin with less volatile assets like stablecoins before exploring broader crypto exposure. 

The arrival of sensible, clear-sighted regulation is a unique opportunity for corporate finance to assert leadership by leveraging the efficiency and accessibility of digital assets. The guardrails haven't disappeared — they've evolved to embrace the yield potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.

 The raise includes a transaction of $10 million where the company accepted Bitcoin instead of cash. 

American Bitcoin, a majority-owned subsidiary of crypto mining firm Hut 8, has raised $220 million to buy Bitcoin mining equipment and to bolster the company's Bitcoin treasury.

According to a regulatory filing, 11 million shares were issued in a private placement on Friday, with gross proceeds amounting to $220 million. 

However, $10 million worth of shares were sold for Bitcoin instead of cash, with the average cost of acquisition standing at $104,000 per coin.

On June 10, it was reported that American Bitcoin's Bitcoin treasury stood at 215 Bitcoin.

Notably, the firm has ties to the Trump family, as President Donald Trump's sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, were among the founders of American Bitcoin. Hut 8 acquired a majority stake in the firm on March 31.

Meanwhile, Hut 8 is expanding its operations to Dubai by opening an office in the city, according to a Bloomberg report. The purpose behind the expansion is to trade cryptocurrencies and accumulate digital assets.

The company was registered with the authorities on June 23 under Hut 8 Investment Ltd.

Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot told Bloomberg that the company's Dubai expansion will “enhance the precision and efficiency of Hut 8's capital strategy.”

The UAE has become a hub for crypto startups in recent years due to its favorable crypto regulations and taxation structure.

However, crypto startups still need to lay out a legal strategy to avoid missteps and comply with local regulations.

The new Dubai office has no ties to American Bitcoin, a Hut 8 spokesperson told Bloomberg.

In May, it was announced that American Bitcoin would go public by merging with Gryphon Digital Mining, a crypto-mining company listed on the Nasdaq exchange.

The deal will be conducted via a stock swap, with the new entity using the American Bitcoin brand. Eric Trump will be on the board post-merger.

Under the new structure, existing shareholders of American Bitcoin will hold 98% of the newly formed entity. Hut 8 will continue to oversee the operational activities of the newly formed venture.

More than a decade in the making, the Vera Rubin Observatory finally released its first image as its begins its groundbreaking 10-year astronomy mission.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

On August 1, 2014, workers began construction of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) perched atop Cerro Pachón in Chile's Atacama Desert. Fast forward a decade later, and the LSST—now called the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, named for the American astronomer whose groundbreaking work provided evidence for the existence of dark matter—is finally ready to start doing some serious science.

Its main mission will be the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (confusingly also abbreviated LSST), which will ceaselessly scan the night sky continuously for 10 years, noting every visible change along the way. Vera Rubin is particularly well-suited for this task—with a 28-foot-wide primary mirror, and 11-foot-wide secondary mirror, and the largest digital camera ever constructed, this terrestrial telescope can move its 300-ton bulk one full rotation in a half a minute at full speed, according to The New York Times. The amount of data Rubin will collect in the next year alone will be more than all other optical observatories combined. To put it mildly, it's an exciting time.

To celebrate the beginning of its operation, the observatory has released the first images captured by the telescope. A combination of 678 different images, the photo above shows that brilliant Trifid nebula (top right) with the Lagoon nebula (bottom left), which is located more than 4,000 light-years from Earth. The lead image of this article (an in-depth look at the Virgo cluster) is only 2 percent of a full Rubin image, which would actually require 400 ultra high-definition TVs to display. Below is a labeled image of a swath of galaxies and stars—some of which we know, and many of which we've never seen before.

“These images vividly showcase the unprecedented power that Rubin will use to revolutionize astronomy and our understanding of the Universe,” astronomers Manda Banerji and Phil Wiseman from the University of Southampton wrote in The Conversation. “Rubin is truly transformative, thanks to its unique combination of sensitivity, vast sky area coverage and exceptional image quality.” 

It's a big moment for ground-based astronomy, which has often been eclipsed by groundbreaking discoveries made by space-based telescopes like Hubble and JWST. While it's true that these floating telescopes offer a ton of benefits—chief among them being that they circumvent atmospheric interference and the increasing annoyance of satellite disruption (think Starlink)—the benefits of ground-based observatories far outweigh these visual costs. 

For one, these telescopes can be easily maintained and—crucially—upgraded with the latest and greatest technologies because... you know... they're on the ground. And without the need for payload restrictions, ground-based telescopes can be absolutely gargantuan (look no further than the adequately named Extremely Large Telescope, also under construction in the Atacama Desert). A quick comparison: JWST's Near Infrared Camera has a field of view of roughly 0.05 square degrees, whereas Vera Rubin has a full 9.6 square degrees. That means it can simply see way more sky than its space-based cousins. Rubin will also be able to produce incredibly high-definition photographs in just a few days, rather than the few years needed by other telescopes.

At the end of its 10-year LSST mission, Rubin will provide invaluable data for investigating dark energy and dark matter, as well as information regarding some 20 billion galaxies. Rubin will also observe billions of objects on more than 800 separate occasions, which will create a kind of astronomical movie detailing the evolution of the night sky over time. Especially excitingly, it will capture asteroids as they move through the Solar System. The Observatory estimates that LSST will discover five million asteroids in the next few years alone—five times more than what humanity has discovered in the last two centuries.

After decades of waiting, it's time for the science to finally commence. 

“[Vera Rubin] represents the culmination of about two decades of dedication, innovation, and collaboration by a global team,” Željko Ivezić, Director of Rubin Observatory Construction, said in a press statement. “With construction now complete, we're turning our eyes fully to the sky—not just to take images, but to begin a whole new era of discovery.”

AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate the majority of excitatory neurotransmission in the brain1. Assembled from combinations of four core subunits, GluA1-4, and ~20 auxiliary subunits, their molecular diversity tunes information transfer and storage in a brain circuit-specific manner. GluA3, a subtype strongly associated with disease2, functions as both a fast transmitting Ca2+-permeable (CP) AMPAR at sensory synapses3, and as a Ca2+-impermeable (CI) receptor at cortical synapses4,5. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the CP GluA3 homomer, which substantially diverge from other AMPARs. The GluA3 extracellular domain tiers (NTD and LBD) are closely coupled throughout gating states, creating previously unseen interfaces that impact signalling and harbour human disease mutations. Central to this architecture is a stacking interaction between two arginine residues (Arg163) in the NTD dimer interface, trapping a unique NTD dimer conformation that enables close contacts with the LBD. Rupture of the Arg163 stack not only alters the structure and dynamics of the GluA3 extracellular region, but also increases receptor trafficking, and the expression of GluA3 heteromers at the synapse. We further show that a mammalian-specific GluA3 trafficking checkpoint determines conformational stability of the LBD tier. Hence, specific design features define communication and biogenesis of GluA3, offering a framework to interrogate this disease-prone glutamate receptor.

Nickel photocatalysis has recently become vital to organic synthesis, but how the Ni(II)X2L pre-catalyst (X = Cl, Br; L = bidentate ligand) becomes activated to Ni(I)XL has remained puzzling and is typically addressed on a case-by-case basis. Here, we reveal a general mechanism where light induces photolysis of the Ni(II)-X bond, either via direct excitation or triplet energy transfer. Photolysis produces Ni(I)XL and a halogen radical, X•. Subsequent hydrogen atom abstraction, often from the solvent, produces a C(sp3) radical, R•, that recombines with Ni(I) to form organonickel(II) complexes, Ni(II)XRL. Rather than acting as a loss pathway, Ni(II)XRL behaves as a light-activated reservoir of Ni(I) via photolysis of the Ni(II)-C bond. These results explain the role of the solvent in protecting the catalyst from off-cycle dimerization, demonstrate that two photons are often required to drive the reaction, and show how tuning the ligand can control the concentration of active Ni(I) species.

NiX2L is widely used as a pre-catalyst (commonly, L = dtbbpy = 4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine, X = Cl, Br) in both singly Ni-catalyzed1 and dual Ni/photosensitizer (PS) catalyzed2,3,4,5,6,7 synthetic methodologies that have seen extremely rapid growth over the last decade. Its advantages over traditional Pd-catalyzed methods have led to adoption at scale in the pharmaceutical industry8,9,10,11, and include: mild conditions (e.g., weak bases, room temperature operation), different scope due to the increased propensity of Ni towards radical reactivity, and the abundance and low cost of Ni sources. Until now, a central mystery has been how Ni(II) pre-catalysts such as NiX2L are activated to form the Ni(I) or Ni(0) species generally proposed as the active state of the catalyst. Past experiments have supported varying electron12,13,14,15 and energy transfer (EnT) type1,16,17,18,19 initiation mechanisms in specific methodologies, giving rise to a broad consensus that the mechanism is unique to each set of reaction conditions.

However, we show herein that a general mechanism operates in the case of many methodologies where pre-catalyst activation occurs through energy transfer from a photosensitizer (PS) or via direct photoexcitation. Indeed, the same initiation step of Ni(II)-X bond photolysis (Fig. 1A) has recently been proposed across diverse methodologies (e.g., C-H activations, cross electrophile couplings, and C-heteroatom couplings)20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27, yet no study has elucidated the full photolysis mechanism through both rigorous detection of the photo-products, Ni(I)XL and the halogen radical (X•), and determination of their downstream chemistry (especially the fate of X•).

A Hypothesis 1: energy transfer quenching (left) or direct excitation (right) of Ni(II) results in Ni-X photolysis to produce Ni(I) and a halogen (X = Cl, Br) radical. The 8 refs. 20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27. B Hypothesis 2: halogen radical engages in hydrogen atom abstraction with an organic solvent or reagent, R-H. The resulting carbon-centered radical reacts with Ni(I) to produce NiXRL, shown for the specific case of L = dtbbpy. C Reaction where hypothesized steps in (A) and (B) are directly relevant and product forming. For example, see refs. 20,48,50. D Reaction where above steps are off-cycle, leading to a solvent-coupled side product. For example, see refs. 21,28,35.

Herein, we discover that X• engages in hydrogen atom transfer with any suitable partner (often the solvent, e.g., ethereal or benzylic compounds) to form a carbon-centered radical, R•, that adds to Ni(I) to form organometallic Ni(II)XRL intermediates (See Fig. 1B), where X = Br, Cl and L is a bidentate N,N′ type ligand, commonly dtbbpy. Despite significant recent mechanistic advances20 and direct incorporation of the R group into the product in C-H activations (Fig. 1C), a Ni(II)XRL intermediate has never been proposed in this reaction class. In cross-electrophile coupling reactions, solvent-derived byproducts have been detected (Fig. 1D)28, yet the mechanism of their formation has remained elusive until now. Herein, we also find that Ni(II)XRL can be further photolyzed (Fig. 1B), serving as a visible-light absorbing reservoir state which releases Ni(I)XL prior to oxidative addition of aryl halide substrates.

We substantiate the full photolysis initiation mechanism using a comprehensive suite of techniques, including X-ray and optical transient absorption spectroscopies (XTA, OTA) and electrochemical methods. Further, we follow the photolysis of NiX2L resulting from energy transfer or direct excitation of NiX2L in the absence of a PS, finding a wavelength dependence where UV (360 nm) excitation results in formation of a greater proportion of photo-products than violet (400 nm) light for the model case of L = dtbbpy, X = Cl. Two photo-products are detected, a major one (λmax = 500 nm) and a minor one (λmax = 420, 660 nm). Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy) is assigned as the minor photo-product through a combination of techniques, including steady state ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), and pulse radiolysis (PR).

The major photo-product (λmax = 500 nm) is assigned as Ni(II)XRL, formed via downstream dark reactivity involving the Ni(I) and X radical photo-products, as in Fig. 1B. A series of highly water sensitive, orange to red to pink colored Ni(II)XRL complexes are detected with UV-vis, where L = dtbbpy, 4,4′-ditrifluoromethyl-2,2′-bipyridine (CF3bpy), 6,6′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine (66Mebpy), or 2,9-Dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (29Mephen), X = Cl or Br, and R = an organometallic ligand derived from 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1,4-dioxane (Diox), toluene (Tol), or 4-fluorotoluene (4FTol). For NiCl(CDME)(dtbbpy), further characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), PR, EPR, and density functional theory calculations (DFT) is consistent with its assigned square planar structure and singlet ground state. Importantly, NiCl(C4FTol)(dtbbpy) is independently synthesized, fully characterized (including by Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction, SCXRD), and found to spectroscopically match in situ experiments producing it photochemically from 4FTol. Further, NiCl(CDME)(dtbbpy) is found to convert to \({{\mbox{NiBr}} }({{\rm{C}}}_{{\mbox{BzCF}}_{3}})({{\mbox{dtbbpy}}})\) in the presence of aryl halide and light, showing that Ni(II)XRL also serves as a reservoir for catalytically active Ni(I) species.

In the following sections, we examine two main mechanistic hypotheses outlined in Fig. 1A, B. First, the hypothesis that both energy transfer from a PS and direct excitation of NiX2L result in the formation of Ni(I)XL and X•. Second, that a carbon-centered radical, R•, formed via X• engaging in hydrogen atom abstraction with R-H, undergoes radical addition to Ni(I)XL to form a Ni(II)XRL reservoir state. We employ NiCl2(dtbbpy) (X = Cl, L = dtbbpy) dissolved in DME (R-H = DME) as a model system, with the optional photosensitizer [Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2(dtbbpy)]PF6, referred to from here on as “Ir PS”, where dF(CF3)ppy = 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-5-trifluoromethylpyridine. In addition, we optionally include aryl bromide 4-bromobenzotrifluoride (ArBr) and the base 2,6-lutidine (lut). These Ni source, PS, base, and substrate were selected as they are utilized in pivotal methodologies and mechanistic studies20,23,28.

Importantly, this choice of model system also results in a homogeneous solution with comparatively simple Ni speciation. Many other solvents commonly used in Ni catalysis (e.g., N,N-dimethylacetamide [DMAc], N,N-dimethylformamide [DMF], acetonitrile [MeCN]) bind to Ni, creating a complex mixture of species15,16,29. Here, the speciation of commercially purchased, isolated NiCl2(dtbbpy) upon dissolution in DME matches that of the 1:1 molar ratio mixture of NiCl2(DME) and dtbbpy (See SI, Fig. S6). As such, a ligand exchange equilibrium must exist where dtbbpy displaces DME. From UV-vis titration experiments where the dtbbpy concentration is increased while the total [Ni] is held constant, the 1:1 mixture is found to contain both NiCl2(DME) and NiCl2(dtbbpy), with the latter as the dominant species (See SI, Figs. S2–3). For the following experiments, either a 1:1 ratio solution or a 1:3 ratio solution will be employed, as the former is most commonly used in catalysis and the latter predominantly contains NiCl2(dtbbpy). The common solutions employed throughout are defined here:

As one of the immediate photo-products of Ni(II)-Cl photolysis, detecting Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy) is vital to testing the first main hypothesis of this work. Since Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy) has never been isolated, we produced it in situ via two distinct methods, Ni(0/II) comproportionation and Ni(II/I) reduction by pulse radiolysis, both of which are consistent with its reported EPR and UV-vis (i.e., λ = 420, 660 nm maxima) spectroscopic handles (For a detailed discussion, See SI, Section 17). The Ni/Ir mixture in DME was used to test the hypothesis that energy transfer to Ni(II)Cl2(dtbbpy) from the Ir PS results in Ni(I) formation (See Table 1 for component details). Support for the assignment of the quenching mechanism as EnT will be detailed in the next section below. Upon steady state irradiation of this mixture with a 405 nm LED (216 mW cm−2), EnT results in appearance of a new absorption difference feature centered at 500 nm (See SI, Figs. S13–14). Introducing 2,6-lutidine23,28 to the reaction mixture results in a 6-fold increase in the steady state concentration of the 500 nm photo-product. The feature, due to the major photo-product absorbing at 500 nm, does not match the UV-vis spectrum for Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy), but its enhancement by addition of a base is consistent with the mechanism in Fig. 1C, where HX is a reaction product. A shift in lutidine 1H NMR resonances (See SI, Fig. S71) upon irradiation is observed, consistent with formation of the lutadinium-Cl salt. In support of this explanation, addition of HCl to lutidine in the absence of light, Ni, or Ir results in chemical shift changes of the same magnitude and direction (See SI, Fig. S72). We thus infer that the 500 nm absorption peak can be assigned to Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy), which we substantiate extensively in the following sections.

In addition to enhancement of the major photo-product buildup, an additional minor photo-product appears as a growth of additional spectral features at λ = 420, 660 nm at later irradiation times (See SI, Figs. S50–51). These can be most readily deconvoluted through spectral subtraction. The double difference spectrum (Fig. 2B) calculated via subtraction of the final two time points reveals the diagnostic features of Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy) which match those produced independently via comproportionation or pulse radiolysis (See SI, Figs. S8, S100–105). Furthermore, if the same mixture is prepared in an air-tight EPR tube and irradiated at the same LED power, EPR analysis reveals diagnostic features of Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy) (Fig. 2C). Fitting the irradiated difference EPR spectrum reveals g-values of gx = 2.056, gy = 2.086, and gz = 2.278, which compare well with the values gx = 2.050, gy = 2.070, and gz = 2.248 reported by Hadt and colleagues30. Together, these results strongly support the formation of Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy) through photolysis of the Ni(II)-Cl bond. While the photolysis of Ni(III)-X bonds is well studied31,32, these findings represent direct evidence of Ni(II)-X photolysis via energy transfer from a PS. In the next section, we present evidence to support assignment of the role of the Ir PS as an energy transfer donor.

Downstream reactivity of the Ni(I) and Cl• photo-products will be elucidated in depth in a later section of this work.

EPR conditions: temperature T = 5 K, microwave power P = 0.1 mW, microwave frequency F  = 9.372 GHz. For EPR experimental details and additional time points, See SI, Figs. S92–93.

In this section, we continue probing the hypothesis that energy transfer to NiCl2(dtbbpy) results in Ni(I) formation through a combination of transient optical and X-ray absorption techniques (OTA and XTA). Time-resolved methods, in conjunction with techniques to aid in spectral assignment, enable the unambiguous assignment of photochemical reaction mechanisms through the detection (or lack thereof) of specific photo-products33. Figure 3A shows a ns-μs OTA experiment we use to assign the nature of the photoreaction between the Ir PS and Ni, while Fig. 3B, C show a photolysis scheme and kinetics for fs-ns timescale OTA experiments conducted in flow, where we directly excite Ni(II)Cl2(dtbbpy) at both UV (360 nm) and visible (400 nm) pump wavelengths in the absence of the Ir PS.

Dotted lines indicate selected probe wavelengths for which kinetic traces are shown (inset) along with a global fit (black lines). B Scheme explaining rationale for the observed wavelength dependence. A higher lying excited state with increased quantum yield (ϕ) for photolysis can be accessed with a 360 nm photon but not with 400 nm. C Fluence matched kinetic slices at λprobe = 660 nm of the NiCl2(DME): dtbbpy 1:3 mixture excited at λpump = 360 or 400 nm without a PS. A persistent signal decays to the baseline with a 338 ps lifetime. For additional details, See SI, Optical Transient Absorption section.

OTA on the ns-μs timescale of the Ir/Ni mixture in Fig. 3A reveals a significantly shortened decay compared to Ir alone (1.78 μs to 0.44 μs from global analysis fitting, See SI, Figs. S113–118), indicating quenching of the excited Ir PS. In Fig. 3A: inset, the kinetics and global fit clearly show persistent features that survive beyond the experimental window (45 μs). The datasets with/without Ni are both globally fit with models involving monoexponential decay of the Ir PS triplet metal to ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) state; however, an additional infinite component was added to the Ir/Ni model to account for the persistent features. The species associated spectrum (SAS) obtained from the global fit for the infinite component (See SI, Figs. S119–120) is assigned as a mixture of the Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy) and Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy) photo-products.

The SAS of the persistent component aids in assignment of the quenching mechanism as energy transfer, as it does not match the spectrum of either the electrochemically oxidized or reduced Ir PS (See SI, Fig. S63) that would be the product of photoinduced electron transfer quenching. Specifically, we note that reductive quenching would result in formation of the singly reduced Ir PS, and its diagnostic sharp features (λ = 480–530 nm, See SI, Fig. S63) are not present in either the spectral evolution shown in in Fig. 3A or the SAS (Fig. S120). In addition, cyclic voltammetry data in DME (See SI, Fig. S62) does not show an oxidation wave for NiCl2(dtbbpy) accessible with the known excited state oxidation potential of the Ir PS (E*ox = 1.21 V vs. SCE)34, suggesting that the reductive quenching pathway is unlikely on thermodynamic grounds. Importantly, XTA experiments at the Ir L3 edge do not show a persistent component, as is consistent with that component arising from Ni-based photo-products in the OTA experiment, instead exhibiting complete recovery of the ground state of the Ir PS along with a quenched 3MLCT lifetime (See SI, Fig. S149). This complete recovery is inconsistent with the presence of Ir(IV), which would be the product of oxidative quenching. Stern-Volmer quenching studies (See SI, Fig. S58) with increasing [Ni] concentration allow extraction of a rate constant for this process of kq = (3.41 ± 0.31) * 109 M−1 s−1, while quenching experiments including reaction components used in one relevant methodology, cross electrophile coupling of aryl and alkyl halides35, reveal the Ni catalyst as the dominant quencher in that system (See SI, Fig. S57).

These observations together strongly support a catalytically relevant energy transfer quenching mechanism, in agreement with our recent work in a closely related acetonitrile-based system21. Notably, reported OTA data in that work employs the same Ni/Ir mixture in acetonitrile where a persistent signal was not observed, consistent with our DME solvent-dependent hypothesis outlined in Fig. 1C. Although excitation of the Ir PS in the Ir/Ni mixture produces long-lived photo-products (Fig. 3A), it is not a suitable experiment for resolving the photolysis dynamics. EnT does not proceed instantaneously, which limits the maximum available concentration of the excited Ni products, as they are spread out in time. Considering that the longest-lived excited-state lifetime of Ni(II)Cl2(dtbbpy) has been reported to be less than 60 ps36, it cannot be expected to appear at any significant concentration during the ns timescale EnT. Therefore, we investigated the photolysis step with femtosecond OTA.

Figure 3C shows kinetic traces from OTA experiments conducted in flow at 2 pump wavelengths to test the hypothesis of ultrafast Ni(II)-Cl bond photolysis. We find that photolysis of Ni(II)Cl2(dtbbpy) occurs if λpump = 360 nm (estimated ϕphotolysis = 0.13) as indicated by a persistent signal at λprobe = 660 nm (i.e., the λmax of Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy)), while employing λpump = 400 nm with matched fluence results in minimal photolysis (estimated ϕphotolysis = 0.01; See SI, Optical Transient Absorption section for details). We emphasize that this estimation describes the quantum yield for the photolysis step without influence from downstream steps such as recombination or cage escape that typically contribute to quantum yields measured by steady-state methods.

The spectral shape and evolution differ between the two datasets even at sub-picosecond times (For spectral traces, 2D maps, and global fitting see SI, Figs. S127–137), with the λpump = 360 nm dataset showing greater absorption at wavelengths longer than 510 nm. There is complete baseline recovery within 25 ps (Fig. 3C) for 400 nm excitation, while for 360 nm excitation the signal persists until 800 ps at 660 nm as shown by the 660 nm dynamics in Fig. 3C. The λpump = 400 nm data is globally fit with a model that includes a 2 component decay to the ground state with τ0 = 0.25 ps and τ1 = 1.88 ps, which we assign as nonradiative decay processes occurring after photoexcitation into the lower energy absorption feature (λshoulder = 380 nm, ϵ = 330.7 M−1 cm−1; See SI, Fig. S4). The λpump =  360 nm data, in contrast, involves photoexcitation into a higher energy feature (λshoulder = 330 nm, ϵ = 1118.1 M−1 cm−1; See SI, Fig. S4).

The λpump = 360 nm dataset requires the inclusion of an additional species component and kinetic parameter to capture the appearance and subsequent decay of the persistent features. The first two components decay with lifetimes τ0 = 0.11 ps and τ1 = 1.94 ps similar to the λpump = 400 nm case and consistent with the same nonradiative decay pathways being present. In a parallel pathway, photolysis from the higher lying excited state occurs within the instrument response (≃250 fs), producing photolysis products which recombine to recover the ground state with a lifetime of τ2 = 338 ps. We note that the photolysis products SAS does not match the spectrum of Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy) (See SI, Figs. S136–137), though it is consistent with Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy) being present as a major component.

This stark wavelength dependence in the quantum yield for photolysis (i.e., ϕ360 = 0.13 and ϕ400 = 0.01) constitutes an “anti-Kasha”37 photochemical event in that it can be explained through accessing a higher lying electronic transition with 360 nm light that is inaccessible with 400 nm light (Fig. 3B). This higher state could have greater activity for photolysis if it involves ligand-to-metal charge transfer (i.e., chloride to Ni) character, as suggested by reported time-dependent density functional theory calculations36. In a related recent study, the rate of Ni(II)-C photolysis in NiCl(dtbbpy)(o-tolyl) was found to exhibit a similar wavelength dependence wherein increased reactivity was observed approaching shorter wavelengths from 450–350 nm38. Importantly, these data support that direct photoexcitation of Ni(II)Cl2(dtbbpy) results in ultrafast photolysis of the Ni-Cl bond. In another study and consistent with this observation, photolysis of Cu(II)-Cl bonds has been observed to occur on an ultrafast timescale39.

The second main hypothesis of this work involves the fate of initially produced Ni(I)XL. The proposal put forward in Fig. 1C is that radical addition of R• to Ni(I)XL forms Ni(II)XRL, also shown in Fig. 4A for the specific case of Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy).

Upon irradiation of the Ni/Ir/lut mixture, it was noted above that a species with visible λmax = 500 nm forms as the dominant photo-product after steady state illumination with 405 nm light, associated with a color change in the mixture from yellow to orange-red (See SI, Fig. S51). The same feature was also detected under UV LED irradiation (365 nm, 340 nm) without the Ir PS, consistent with the proposed EnT pathway (See SI, Figs. S9–10) and the evidence of ultrafast photolysis of Ni(II)Cl2(dtbbpy) with a 360 nm pump. Consistent with the wavelength dependence found in the previous section, repeating the same experiment with 405 nm light does not produce any significant photo-products (See SI, Figs. S11–12).

Here, we substantiate our spectral assignment of the 500 nm absorption peak to Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy). We employ pulse radiolysis (PR) experiments to make Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy) via an entirely different route, conduct Ni K-edge XAS experiments on concentrated solutions of the photo-product to understand its coordination environment, and use proton NMR to follow its production. Finally, we repeat the UV-vis and NMR experiments with 4-fluorotoluene (4FTol) instead of DME to produce a related organonickel complex, Ni(II)Cl(C4FTol)(dtbbpy), which we also synthesized independently, isolated, and crystallographically characterized. Additional circumstantial evidence for this assignment is that the λmax = 500 nm species is quickly decomposed upon exposure to water vapor in the air or in a wet nitrogen stream (See SI, Figs. S31–34). Unexpectedly, when the Ni/Ir mixture is prepared under air and sealed with a limited headspace, a greater amount of the 500 nm absorbing species is observed after an induction period (See SI, Figs. S35–37). We take advantage of this finding for XAS measurements below.

Pulse radiolysis is an exceptionally powerful tool for studying radical chemistry because it allows exogeneous production of radical intermediates, breaking reaction steps down into their elementary components. Here we use it to produce Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy) in situ without photolysis of Ni(II)Cl2(dtbbpy) (Fig. 4A, R = DME). Notably, PR has advantages over traditional methods of probing radical involvement, such as radical or spin trapping, in that no additional species (e.g., traps) need to be added that may interfere with the process under study. Indeed, spin trapping was unsuccessful here since introduction of the trap changed the quenching mechanism, resulting in detection of the reduced Ir PS by EPR (See SI, Fig. S97). PR in DME creates the DME-derived radical via electron ejection followed by fragmentation of the radical cation to a neutral radical and a solvated proton. In THF, this process is known to occur with a 500 fs time constant40, suggesting it is plausible for DME radicals to form in the PR experiment with sufficient concentration for addition to Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy), forming NiCl(CDME)(dtbbpy) (See SI, Fig. S106 for a scheme with additional details). Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy) is supplied in high concentration using the Ni(0/II) comproportionation mixture.

Figure 4B shows the pulse radiolysis spectrum of the comproportionation mixture as a function of delay time, compared with the difference spectrum obtained earlier by photolysis of Ni(II)Cl2(dtbbpy). Evidently, pulse radiolysis of this mixture results in growth of the same 500 nm absorption feature as in photolysis of Ni(II)Cl2(dtbbpy) simultaneous with loss of the 660 and 420 nm peaks associated with Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy) in Fig. 2A (See SI, Fig. S111 for an overlaid plot). This data strongly supports production of Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy) on the 100s of ns to μs timescale (Fig. 4B; for additional time points, see SI, Fig. S109). Formation of Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy) occurs to a lesser extent at lower concentrations of total [Ni], becoming the dominant process at 2.5 mM. At 5.0 mM [Ni], Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy) forms with increased rate (See SI, Figs. S107–110). Finally, the absorption spectrum of Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy) persists in UV-vis after conclusion of the PR experiment, consistent with its long timescale stability (See SI, Fig. S112). This experiment allows observation of C(sp3) radical addition to Ni(I) in real time, an important step proposed across the field of Ni photocatalysis, for example, in C(sp3)-C(sp2) carboxylations or alkyne hydroalkylations41,42. Further investigation of this step utilizing this comproportionation platform will be explored in future work.

X-ray absorption (XAS) experiments can explicitly probe the coordination environment around metal atoms, and we use it here to test the hypothesis that radical addition of DME• to NiCl(dtbbpy) forms a square planar Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy) complex, as shown in Fig. 4A. Samples were prepared by irradiating both the Ni/Ir/lut (under N2) and Ni/Ir (under air) mixtures and subsequently concentrating them under vacuum on a Schlenk line (See SI, section 13 for further details). Ni K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of both mixtures revealed the growth of the pre-edge absorption at 8333.7 eV and the appearance of a new near-edge absorption feature at 8338 eV (See SI, Fig. 4C, Fig. S146). The presence and energies of these features are consistent with either a planar or square pyramidal geometry of Ni(II). Based on literature precedent, they are assigned to 1s  → 3d (8333.7 eV) and 1s  → 4pz (8338 eV) transitions43. The new absorption features are compared to those of reported four-coordinate Ni(II)(Caryl)Ln species44, as well as a commercially available square planar nickel reference compound, Ni(II)(TMEDA)(o-Tol)Cl (TMEDA = N,N,N′,N′-Tetramethylethane-1,2-diamine, o-tol = ortho-tolyl). The XAS spectrum of Ni(TMEDA)(o-Tol)Cl is plotted in 4C, highlighting the similarity with the species formed upon irradiation of the Ni/Ir (air) mixture. Compared to NiCl2(dtbbpy), both species demonstrate increased intensity and blue-shifted energy of the 1s  → 3d peak, as well as the appearance of 1s  → 4pz features of similar energies. Time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations carried out on Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy) using Ni(TMEDA)(o-Tol)Cl as an energy shift reference show good agreement between experimental and theoretical NiCl(CDME)(dtbbpy) X-ray absorption maxima energies (See SI, Fig. S165).

The low intensity of the 1s  → 4pz peak of the irradiated Ni/Ir (air) sample is attributed to the presence of a mixture of species in solution. Because of this, quantitative peak area analysis that might be correlated to coordination number was not possible, and a five-coordinate square pyramidal geometry cannot be ruled out based on the XANES data alone. However, we favor four-coordinate singlet Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy) as the source of the observed pre-edge XAS features and the 500 nm optical absorption, as there are no known strongly coordinating L type ligands in the mixture that could occupy a fifth coordination site. Efforts to optimize singlet Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy) with either H2O or κ1-DME in the axial coordination site resulted in the exogenous ligand dissociating in silico. A trigonal planar Ni(I) species could also impart intensity to both sets of transitions, although a reference compound of this type shows that the 1s  → 3d peak energy is red shifted by about 3 eV compared to that measured here45. Consideration of additional species that could contribute to the XANES spectra of the Ni/Ir (air) mixture can be found in the SI, Section 13. The XANES data, consistent with square planar geometry at Ni(II), in conjunction with DFT computations of alternative possible structures and configurations (See SI, Section 14), strongly supports assignment of the 500 nm absorbing species as NiCl(CDME)(dtbbpy) with a singlet ground state configuration.

The major photo-product, Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy), can exist as 2 isomers (Fig. 4D, depending on whether a DME radical is formed through methylene or methyl C-H activation. We used 1H NMR to probe the Ni/Ir/lut mixture in a 1:10 DME:benzene-d6 mixed solvent system, irradiated in a custom tube photoreactor setup (For setup details, See SI, Section 8). Upon irradiation, a pair of 1H NMR signals appear that vary in ratio with increasing irradiation time (Fig. 4D and SI, Figs. S65–70). We assign these peaks to the Ni-bound, dtbbpy tert-butyl groups (18H) of each regioisomer. If this assignment is correct, only a single photoinduced signal should be observed if DME is replaced with 4FTol, as 4FTol is only susceptible to H-atom abstraction in the benzylic position and thus cannot form organonickel regioisomers. Indeed, only 1 peak is observed at a similar chemical shift in Fig. 4D (i.e., DME: δ = 0.952/0.946; 4FTol: δ = 0.912)(See SI, Figs. S78–80). Further, these NMR assignments are supported by the independent synthesis and full characterization of Ni(II)Cl(C4FTol)(dtbbpy) (See SI, Section 3 for characterization and stability details; Section 15 for SCXRD).

Notably, the UV-vis spectrum of the isolated deep red solid dissolved in 4-fluorotoluene exactly matches that generated through energy transfer induced photolysis (See Fig. 4E). In crystalline form, Ni(II)Cl(C4FTol)(dtbbpy) exhibits distorted square planar geometry and a Ni-C bond distance of 1.958(4) Å consistent with the small subset of known organonickel(II) complexes featuring ligands derived from toluene (1.964(2) Å) or 2-methylnaphthalene (1.958(2) Å) (For SCXRD details, See SI, Section 15)42,46. Comparatively, Ni-Caryl complexes have significantly shorter Ni-C bond lengths, for example, 1.896(4) Å for Ni(II)Cl(Cp-Tol)(dtbbpy)47 and 1.873(5) Å for Ni(II)Cl(Co-Tol)(dtbbpy)36. Overall, these experiments provide strong support for the identities of the square planar organonickel intermediates, Ni(II)Cl(C4FTol)(dtbbpy) and Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy), and their formation via the steps detailed in Fig. 1A–B. Further, these observations offer insight into the regioselectivity of product formation where multiple C-H activation possibilities exist, for example, in catalytic reactions with DME28,48. The ratio of regioisomers observed in Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy) here agrees well with the reported product regiochemistry (i.e., 1.35:1) for the coupling of DME with 4-chloroacetophenone48.

In addition, while the formation and role of Ni(II)-Caryl intermediates in catalysis are well-studied49, comparatively little is known of Ni-C(sp3) species. In a recent advance, a Ni(II) complex possessing two organometallic ligands, a C(sp3) neosilyl ligand and a C(sp2) o-tolyl ligand, was reported20 and found to undergo light-driven reductive elimination of a C(sp2)-C(sp3) product. While interesting, this type of intermediate was not proposed to be on-cycle for C-H activation. Thus, further investigation of Ni(II)XRL, which lacks the organometallic aryl ligand, is crucial to achieve mechanistic understanding in these and other diverse methodologies where these intermediates form.

To this point, we have presented substantial evidence that the ultimate product of photolyzing Ni(II)Cl2(dtbbpy) in DME is Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy), whether through direct excitation or energy transfer from an iridium sensitizer. We have also suggested in Fig. 1C that Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy) can itself be photolyzed to re-form the catalytically active Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy), making it a potentially productive reservoir species that protects the Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy) from dimerization and deactivation. In support of this idea, the double difference spectrum in Fig. 2B also shows a negative feature at λ = 500 nm, indicating loss of some NiCl(CDME)(dtbbpy) concomitant with Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy) formation. Here, we directly assess the participation of Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy) in catalysis.

The structure of Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy) suggests several hypotheses concerning its role in 2 prominent C(sp2)-C(sp3) cross-coupling reactions that have recently been studied in significant mechanistic detail (Fig. 1C, D)20,28. In both reactions, the Ni-Caryl complex \({{\mbox{NiBr}} }({{\rm{C}}}_{{{\mbox{BzCF}}}_{3}})({{\mbox{dtbbpy}}})\) has been identified as the organometallic Ni intermediate present in the highest concentration during the reaction. As such, we hypothesized that Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy) may convert to \({{\mbox{NiBr}} }({{\rm{C}}}_{{{\mbox{BzCF}}}_{3}})({{\mbox{dtbbpy}}})\) under photochemical conditions in the presence of an aryl bromide substrate (Fig. 5A).

B Left axis: UV-vis difference spectra (t = 0 subtracted) of the Ni/Ir/ArBr mixture after increasing irradiation times with a 405 nm LED (216 mW cm−2). Right axis: the overlaid (dashed black trace) UV-vis spectrum of separately synthesized \({{\mbox{NiBr}} }({{\rm{C}}}_{{{\mbox{BzCF}}}_{3}})({{\mbox{dtbbpy}}})\). Arrows indicate an evolution from Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy) to \({{\mbox{NiBr}} }({{\rm{C}}}_{{{\mbox{BzCF}}}_{3}})({{\mbox{dtbbpy}}})\) (C) The scope of R-H. Normalized UV-vis difference spectra of Ni/Ir (N2) mixtures irradiated with a 405 nm LED (216 mW cm−2) in Diox, THF, DME, 4FTol, or Tol as solvent.

Photolysis of the Ni-CDME bond, analogous to the known Ni-Caryl photolysis pathway in Ni-Caryl complexes, would result in formation of Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy), which is known to undergo oxidative addition of aryl halides30. Subsequent comproportionation of the resulting Ni(III) with Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy) would form the \({{\mbox{NiBr}} }({{\rm{C}}}_{{{\mbox{BzCF}}}_{3}})({{\mbox{dtbbpy}}})\) intermediate and one equivalent of Ni(II)Cl2(dtbbpy) (Fig. 5A). To test this hypothesis, the Ni/Ir/ArBr mixture was prepared and irradiated with 405 nm light.

At early irradiation times, the 500 nm feature diagnostic of Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy) forms first (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the hydrogen atom abstraction step and radical addition to Ni(I) are faster than oxidative addition of the aryl bromide, quite consistent with the relative concentrations of DME (solvent) and aryl bromide (reagent). However, as the irradiation progresses, the Ni(II)Cl(CDME)(dtbbpy) is converted to \({{\mbox{NiBr}} }({{\rm{C}}}_{{{\mbox{BzCF}}}_{3}})({{\mbox{dtbbpy}}})\) as evidenced by the formation of a bimodal blue-shifted feature that matches that in the known absorption spectrum of \({{\mbox{NiBr}} }({{\rm{C}}}_{{\mbox{BzCF}}_{3}})({{\mbox{dtbbpy}}})\)28 in DME, which was also supported by independent synthesis (See SI, Fig. S53).

These observations suggest that NiCl(CDME)(dtbbpy) is catalytically relevant in two ways. First, it can be converted back to Ni(I) and undergo oxidative addition. Second, even with aryl halide present in ten-fold excess, oxidative addition is too slow to prevent formation of NiCl(CDME)(dtbbpy), suggesting it continues to form in low concentration throughout the reaction. It is likely that its relative concentration would increase as the rate of oxidative addition decreases, for example, if aryl chlorides were used instead of bromides. As such, it is plausible that in the general case Ni(II)XRL could serve as on-cycle intermediates in many reported C-H activation reactions23,24,48,50, where trapping of an aryl radical produced via photolysis of Ni(II)X(Caryl)L30,38,47 would form the desired product following reductive elimination from Ni(III). We note that NiCl(CDME)(dtbbpy) may additionally be susceptible to photo-oxidation by the Ir PS, a possibility that could be explored in future studies.

Importantly, the reactivity observed in DME to form NiCl(CDME)(dtbbpy) is not limited to that solvent, nor specifically to chloride. Rather, consistent with the scope of ethers and benzylic C-H containing compounds shown in C-H activation methods in the literature23,48, related but distinct UV-vis features form when the solvent in the Ni/Ir mixture is replaced with toluene, 4-fluorotoluene, 1,4-dioxane, or tetrahydrofuran (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, in support of the broad applicability of these findings across Ni photocatalysis, the toluene-derived complex, NiCl(CTol)(dtbbpy), has been isolated and was proposed in recent work as an on-cycle intermediate for the Markovnikov-type alkylation of alkynes42. Similarly, if Ni(II)Br2(dtbbpy) is used in place of Ni(II)Cl2(dtbbpy), a similar spectral evolution is observed (See SI, Figs. S15–16). These results show that the observed reactivity applies generally to other Ni(II)-halide salts and to other solvents with C-H bonds susceptible to abstraction (Fig. 5C). Benzene proved significantly less reactive, consistent with the comparatively higher bond dissociation energy of the aryl C(sp2)-H bond (See SI, Fig. S32)51. If a mixed solvent system contains two species, for example DME and toluene, Ni complexes derived from both solvents are observed, with a greater contribution from the most reactive species (See SI, Figs. S30–31).

Further, the same general mechanism remains at play if dtbbpy is replaced with CF3bpy, resulting in the formation of both Ni(I)Cl(CF3bpy) and NiCl(CDME)(CF3bpy) photo-products at red-shifted wavelengths, although the Ni(I) is observed in a greater ratio relative to Ni(II) (See SI, Figs. S40–42). We hypothesized that the prevalence of the Ni(I) photo-product could be further increased if the bpy ligand were modified through methylation and/or changing the core to phenanthroline. Indeed, Ni(I) becomes the dominant photo-product if dtbbpy is replaced with 66Mebpy (See SI, Figs. S34–35) or 29Mephen (See SI, Figs. S37–38). In both cases, the NiCl(CDME)L photo-product is detected initially, after which Ni(I) becomes dominant with continued irradiation (See SI, Figs. S36, S39). Several effects may be involved to explain these observations, including a less negative Ni(II)/(I) reduction potential upon methylation ortho to the N-atoms of the ligand52, an increase in Ni(II)-C photolysis efficiency, or enhanced stability of the Ni(I) towards dimerization due to increased steric bulk around the Ni center. Overall, these observations can enable rational ligand selection to control the concentration of Ni(I) during catalysis.

The above experiments provide substantial evidence for a general initiation mechanism defined as follows (Fig. 6).

The simplest system consists of NiX2(dtbbpy) dissolved in R-H with no additional reagents. Grayed out segments become active if additional reagents (i.e., PS, base, or substrates) are present in the mixture. CEC = cross-electrophile coupling. ArBr = aryl bromide.

A Ni(II)X2(dtbbpy), where X = Cl or Br, excited state forms through either photoexcitation or energy transfer and undergoes photolysis of the Ni-X bond. The resulting X• abstracts a H-atom from R-H to form R• and HX. The HX can be intercepted by a base (if present) to form the base-halide salt, which serves to suppress the protonation that limits Ni(II)XR(dtbbpy) buildup. R• recombines with Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy) to form Ni(II)XR(dtbbpy), which is also susceptible to photolysis induced by photoexcitation or energy transfer. As such, Ni(II)XR(dtbbpy) serves as a reservoir of active Ni(I) species that protects the Ni(I), limiting its concentration and thus its propensity to undergo off-cycle dimerization. Further, the rapid formation of Ni(II)XR(dtbbpy) suggests the possibility that, through reacting with an aryl radical produced via photolysis of Ni-Caryl species, NiXR(dtbbpy) could lead to product formation directly in C-H activation C(sp2)-(Csp3) coupling reactions. Lastly, changing L = dtbbpy to CF3bpy, 66Mebpy, or 29Mephen increases the ratio of Ni(I)XL to Ni(II)XRL photo-products, thus providing a handle to control the buildup of these reactive intermediates to suit a particular catalytic system.

In this work, we have investigated how Ni-mediated cross-coupling reactions are initiated when the starting Ni source is the pre-catalyst Ni(II)X2(dtbbpy). Spectroscopic evidence supports an initiation mechanism involving the photolysis of Ni(II)-X bonds (X = Br or Cl) to form Ni(I)X(dtbbpy) and NiXR(dtbbpy) as the long-lived photo-products. Importantly, this mechanistic paradigm explains how Ni(I) species active for oxidative addition of aryl halides form through either direct photolysis with UV light or through energy transfer from a suitable photosensitizer. This result is relevant to a number of pivotal methodologies used to create cross-coupled products through C-H activation20,23,24,48,50,53, cross-electrophile coupling26,28,35, or C-heteroatom coupling22,24,25. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements in flow suggest that the efficiency of photolysis through direct excitation increases at wavelengths shorter than 400 nm (i.e., ϕ360 = 0.13 and ϕ400 = 0.01).

C-H activation by X• produced from photolysis results in the formation of R• and HX from any available H-atom source, R-H (e.g., ethers, toluene). Radical addition of R• to Ni(I) results in formation of a rarely studied class of organonickel(II) complexes, NiXR(dtbbpy), (R is derived from toluene, 4-fluorotoluene, THF, DME, or dioxane and X = Cl, Br) that are determined here to possess square planar geometry by XAS and are further supported by multiple spectroscopic techniques, as well as the synthesis of Ni(II)Cl(C4FTol)(dtbbpy). Replacement of dtbbpy with CF3bpy, 66Mebpy, or 29Mephen ligands leads to increasing steady-state Ni(I) buildup, in that order, which can enable control of the Ni(I) concentration during catalysis. Importantly, UV-vis experiments show that these complexes are re-photolyzed to Ni(I)Cl(dtbbpy), which reacts to form NiX(Caryl)(dtbbpy) in the presence of aryl halide coupling partners, complexes that are well-studied and have been identified as the dominant Ni species during catalysis in both C-H activation and cross-electrophile coupling20,28. As such, NiXR(dtbbpy) can be thought of as a light-activated reservoir of active Ni(I), protecting it from pathways (e.g., dimerization) that lead to off-cycle Ni species. The photochemical initiation mechanism presented here could find applicability beyond the reaction systems considered in this work, as NiXRL complexes have been proposed to be on-cycle for light-driven carboxylation41, decarboxylative cross-coupling46, and alkyne hydroalkylation reactions42.

To make and convert the Ni/Ir/lut solution: in a N2-filled glovebox, NiCl2(dtbbpy)(6.0 mg, 0.015 mmol) was weighed into a 25 mL volumetric flask to which 25 mL DME was added to the line. A stir bar was then added, and the solution was stirred for 24 h and syringe filtered (0.2 μm) into two 20 mL scintillation vials. An Ir PS stock solution was separately prepared by weighing the Ir PS (1.5 mg, 0.00625 mmol) into a vial and dissolving it in 1 mL DME. To a quartz 1 cm path length screw cap cuvette, 2.7 mL of the filtered NiCl2(dtbbpy) solution and 0.3 mL of the Ir PS stock solution were combined, along with 2.1 μL of 2,6-lutidine. Liquid handling was done with gas-tight glass syringes. The cuvette was sealed, removed from the glovebox, and irradiated in a custom photoreactor setup with a 405 nm LED (216 mW cm−2 at the sample position). A typical irradiation time at this light flux to observe the color change from pale yellow to orange, indicating formation of NiCl(CDME)(dtbbpy), is 20 min.

After more than a day of continuous debate, the US Senate passed its version of the budget megabill Tuesday afternoon—with potentially disastrous implications for the future of renewable energy in the country.

Among a barrage of bad news for climate initiatives, including a new tax credit for coal and the sunsetting of electric vehicle tax credits, the bill forces an aggressive cutoff for tax credits for wind and solar. The bill ends credits for projects placed in service—a term meaning, essentially, that a project is ready to provide power to the grid—after 2027, putting hundreds of planned projects around the country in jeopardy.

“This is a bill to punish renewables,” says Costa Samaras, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. “There is a real need to add clean energy supply to the grid—electrifying our cars, electrifying our homes, electrifying our buildings, electrifying our factories, and the demands from AI are all going to require new clean energy. What this bill does is make it harder and more expensive.”

Incredibly, the original version of the bill presented Monday evening was even worse news for renewables. That text contained a new tax on wind and solar which would have taxed businesses that source material from certain foreign countries, including China—a charge that would have, in essence, kneecapped both industries. The new text also gives a little bit of leeway to projects that start construction within the next year, allowing them to keep tax credits even if they are not placed in service by the 2027 deadline.

President Donald Trump, who has a long-held animus for windmills, campaigned on ending the Inflation Reduction Act, and the original House bill made good on that promise. But the more extreme last-minute additions made over the weekend in the Senate text alarmed energy analysts, environmentalists, labor unions, Silicon Valley technocrats, and even some Senate Republicans.

The addition of the excise tax, in particular, seemed to have been a total surprise. As NBC reported Monday, several GOP Senators said they had no idea who added in the provision.

Alex Epstein, an energy “philosopher” who has pushed a narrative around fossil fuels being essential for “human flourishing” and who has been an influential voice for Republicans in crafting the end of the IRA tax credits, claimed on X this weekend that he did not support the excise tax.

Elon Musk, whose businesses have benefited from a variety of climate and clean energy-related tax credits, posted a barrage of tweets Sunday and Monday disparaging the renewable energy provisions of the bill.

“The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!” he wrote. “Utterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.”

According to Politico, Trump reportedly pushed Senate leadership last week to craft a text that was more aggressive in phasing out tax credits for renewables than the version of the bill passed in the House. “I HATE “GREEN TAX CREDITS” IN THE GREAT, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL,” Trump posted on TruthSocial in late June, launching into a paragraph-long, error-ridden rant on renewable energy.

Even without the industry-ending excise tax, experts still say that the forced retirement of the tax credits blows up valuable investment in projects already in the pipeline. Since the beginning of the year, the clean energy industry has felt the pressure of looming IRA rollbacks. According to an analysis from energy NGO E2, around $15.5 billion in investment in new clean energy projects and factories has been lost since the start of the year, including more than $9 billion in Republican congressional districts.

The intense hostility for solar and wind coming from the Trump administration may seem, to a logical person, to be at odds with its goal of “energy dominance.” Energy experts say that renewables—particularly when paired with batteries—are helping to bolster the US grid as energy needs soar. Texas, for instance, added more solar and battery storage than any other type of energy to its grid last year. As of this spring, wind and solar combined made up 42 percent of Texas's installed generation capacity, more than any other state in the US. All that new solar and storage has, in turn, helped the grid stay stable during peak use, lowering the risk of blackouts during the first heatwaves of the summer—even as Texas faces never-before-seen summer demand this year, thanks to hot temperatures and the addition of energy-thirsty data centers. Yet in an op-ed published in the New York Post last week, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that wind and solar contribute to a “less stable grid.”

Doug Lewin, an energy analyst based in Austin, points out that solar and batteries are particularly well-positioned to help out with grid demand during heatwaves, when the sun is shining—and people turn on their air conditioners.

“We're just in this situation where we are going to need massive amounts of power to deal with the heat,” he says. “We've gotta have air conditioning to keep people healthy and safe during these hellacious summers, which are getting worse. That's just an objective matter.”

It's particularly ironic to see these kinds of pushbacks as the Trump administration goes all in on artificial intelligence, which, by some projections, could comprise nearly 12 percent of US power demand by the end of the decade. Right now, a global backlog in gas turbines is spelling trouble for those looking to scale up fast. Turbine producers like GE Vernova say they've already filled orders for the next few years, and project it may take several years for new customers to get their hands on a completed turbine. In April, the CEO of renewable and utility giant NextEra Energy told shareholders that he expects renewables to act as a “bridge,” helping to bolster the grid and buy time until bigger gas projects can come online.

But even with the promise of AI using up every spare electron on the grid, the cultural backlash to renewables is as strong as ever—and it isn't isolated to the White House. Despite Texas's reliance on renewables, the state legislature battled over several bills this past session that would have seriously kneecapped solar and wind development in the state. Oklahoma, which relies on wind energy for a third of its energy needs, faces a growing movement to ban renewables altogether. Across the country, local governments, responding to grassroots movements, are pushing back against wind and solar projects on their land. (It's important to note that many of these movements often include Democrats.)

Lewin, who wrote about Texas's legislative drama in detail this year in his newsletter, says it's too simplistic to ascribe the hostility towards renewables as simply being funded by Big Oil. According to Politico, Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, who has received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from oil and gas interests over the course of her career, was an instrumental figure in changing the final Senate language to remove the excise tax. In Texas, the oil and gas lobby united with renewables to defeat a bill that would have made energy prices higher by increasing costs for wind and solar.

“It feels like you've got a large number of really powerful folks who have just decided, or been convinced—and then had that belief reinforced by algorithms over and over—that somehow, wind and solar are the root of all evil and are causing every problem,” Lewin says. “It's bizarre. It's really hard to kind of understand this animus for technologies that have had a huge benefit.”

People voted for President Donald Trump, they wore his shoes, his hats, and his watches, and soon they'll be able to make calls on his phone. Yet there is seemingly always another addition to the ways in which one can experience all that is Trump: which brings us to the latest entry to the commander in chief's ever-expanding fragrance collection.

Victory 47 for Men promises “rich, masculine notes with a refined finish” without actually listing any of the ingredients or its scent profile. Helpfully, early reviews from users at fragrance forum Parfumo describe it as “oriental-fruity” but score it at just 1.9 out of 10.

Price-wise, at $249 for 3.3 fluid ounces, it's comparable with mainstays of blockbuster luxe lines, such as Tom Ford Noir Extreme ($240 for 3 ounces)—but the cachet between the two is likely as far apart as Tom's and Donald's politics.

Fragrances might seem like an odd choice for a personal brand that prides itself on plain-talking and masculine tropes, but according to NPD Group data, celebrity fragrances in the US amounted to $148.5 million between August 2022 and 2023—a 30 percent increase from the same period the year before. And while it's not exactly memecoin money, who wouldn't want a piece of that pie when you can leave the grunt work to a third party?

That upper-but-not-quite-niche $249 pricing also puts Trump fragrances ahead of the more sophisticated celebrity scent sphere. At one end, names such as Jennifer Lopez and Antonio Banderas have long cluttered pharmacy shelves across the world with their lower-market-end-conquering offers (think $25 a pop). Stars such as Ariana Grande are next on the ladder, capturing a huge market with candy-sweet bottles that go for $45 to $68. Then we have our Rhiannas and Billie Eilishes in the $140 ballpark—affordable luxury.

It's not The Donald's first foray into the world of celebrity stink, of course—back in the misty, pre-presidential days of 2004 we had Donald Trump The Fragrance (courtesy of midrange powerhouse Estée Lauder), then Success by Trump in 2012 followed by Empire by Trump in 2015 (both by the parent company of Parlux, which produces Eilish's fragrance line).

Of course, this isn't the first time we've wondered what power actually smells like: JFK famously wore both Eight and Bob and Jockey Club during his time in office, but he wasn't licensing his name and “likeness” to a third party churning out products that he'd likely never purchase himself.

Still, the Trump brand-diffusion plan has caught the eye of fellow authoritarians. Former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has his own line of fragrances courtesy of Brazilian beauty brand Agustin Fernandez—though retailing in the distinctly less-premium neighborhood of R$300 (US$50).

Like Melania Trump, Michelle Bolsonaro, former first lady of Brazil, also got in on the action with the launch of their line in 2024. Perhaps Donald will swap complimentary bottles with Jair, or maybe there's a rare flacon of the Putin-inspired Leaders Number One winging its way over from Russia? The mind—and nostrils—boggle.

As with so much of the product offered on the “GetTrump” family of websites, the imagery is a masterclass of “actual product may vary” visualization. More Oscar statuette than bottle (let's not kid ourselves here—the Trump faithful likely aren't really buying this for the fragrance), the golden, youthful T-1000-like figure is perhaps more Eric than Donald? For the ladies' version (“Sophisticated, subtly feminine,” no clue as to what it smells of; “chypreartig-animal” according to Parfumo), the only concession to femininity is a rose-gold hue to the lower half—you'll still get the stock, gleaming Donalderic homunculus glaring purposefully at you from the dressing table.

Interestingly, the only positive noises about Victory 47 thus far have come from the Fragrantica site (the early visualizations of the bottles are a treat, BTW)—itself somewhat controversial. The site's original review for the “Fight Fight Fight” cologne was criticized across Reddit for failing to mention any injuries or the actual fatality from the shooting in Pennsylvania; it instead cited Trump's inspiring moment of “personal courage.”

For those keeping track, in addition to nine available watches (and 11 in preorder), the current tally of under-license merch from the GetTrump empire now includes Trump Slides, ""Fight Fight Fight” High Tops (silver), and Trump Landslide Boots.

Sadly, that $5 million Gold Trump Card doesn't actually come with any credit, so Trump superfans will have to max out their regular gold cards if they're going to complete the collection.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","AI Videos of Black Women Depicted as ‘Bigfoot' Are Going Viral","https://www.wired.com/story/ai-videos-black-women-depicted-as-primates-viral/","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 17:31:00 GMT","

An AI-generated “bigfoot baddie,” with acrylic nails and a pink wig, speaks directly to her imaginary audience using an iPhone. “We might have to go on the run,” she says. “I'm wanted for a false report on my baby daddy.” This AI video, generated by Google's Veo 3, has racked up over a million views on Instagram. It's just one of many viral posts on Instagram and TikTok viewed by WIRED that depict Black women as primates and perpetuate racist tropes using AI video tools.

Google's Veo 3 was a hit with online audiences when it dropped at the company's developer conference in May. Surreal generations of Biblical characters and cryptids, like bigfoot, doing influencer-style vlogging quickly spread across social media. AI-generated bigfoot vlogs were even used by Google as a selling point in ads promoting the new feature.

With “bigfoot baddies,” online creators are taking what was a fairly innocuous trend on social media and repurposing it to dehumanize Black women. “There's a historical precedent behind why this is offensive. In the early days of slavery, Black people were overexaggerated in illustrations to emphasize primal characteristics,” says Nicol Turner Lee, director of the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution.

“It's both disgusting and disturbing that these racial tropes and images are readily available to be designed and distributed on online platforms,” says Turner Lee.

One of the most popular Instagram accounts posting these generated clips has five videos with over a million views, less than a month after the account's first post. The AI videos feature the animal-woman hybrids speaking African American Vernacular English in a caricatured manner, with the characters often shown wearing a bonnet and threatening to fight people. In one clip, the AI generation, using a country accent, implies she pulled out a bottle of Hennessy liquor that was stored in her genitals.

Veo 3 can create everything seen in videos like this, the scenery to the spoken audio to the characters themselves, from a single prompt. The bio of the popular Instagram account includes a link to a $15 online course where you can learn how to create similar videos. In videos with titles like “Veo 3 does the heavy lifting,” three teachers use voiceover to step students through the process of prompting the AI video tool for bigfoot clips and creating consistent characters. The email address listed as the administrator of the online course bounced back messages when WIRED attempted to contact the creators.

A spokesperson for Meta, which owns Instagram, declined to comment on the record. Google and TikTok both acknowledged WIRED's request for comment, but did not provide a statement prior to publication.

Our social media analysis found copycat accounts on Instagram and TikTok reposting the “bigfoot baddie” clips or generating similar videos. A repost of one video on Instagram has 1 million views on an AI-focused meme page. A different Instagram account has another “bigfoot baddie” video with almost 3 million views. It's not just on Instagram; an account on TikTok dedicated to similar AI-generated content currently has over 1 million likes. These accounts did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“If I die here, I better get resurrected with a BBL,” says an AI-generated female bigfoot on a different account, talking to the camera as she dodges bombs while vacationing in Israel. “One of the problems with generative AI is that the creators of AI tools cannot conceive of all of the ways that people can be horrible to each other,” says Meredith Broussard, a professor at New York University and author of More Than a Glitch, a book about biases in technology. “So, they can't put up a sufficient number of guardrails. It's exactly the same problem we've seen on social media platforms.”

A screenshot of one of the “Bigfoot Baddies” videos WIRED found on Instagram. The video was generated by AI tools.

After clicking on a few of the female bigfoot videos, the Instagram Reels feed for our test account was soon filled by the algorithm with other racist videos—including an AI generation of a Black man on a fishing boat excitedly catching a piece of fried chicken and referring to a chimpanzee as his son.

While these AI videos are upsetting, they are not necessarily surprising. Back in 2023, as an AI-generated video of Will Smith eating spaghetti was going viral on social media, WIRED senior writer Jason Parham dissected the video as a form of minstrelsy. “This coming age of new minstrelsy will assume an even more cunning chameleon form, adaptive and immediate in its guile, from humanistic deepfakes and spot-on voice manipulations to all manner of digital deceit,” Parham wrote at the time.

With this latest wave of generative AI video tools, helmed by Google's Veo 3, it's never been easier to produce photorealistic AI videos. The ease of generating numerous videos paired with the consistent spread of AI slop on social media platforms is part of what's popularized these “bigfoot baddies.” More social media trends where creators use AI to attack minority groups will likely continue. “AI has not only made it easier to manipulate images,” Turner Lee says. “But the algorithm itself, and the ecology of the algorithm, has also made it easier to share or to ramp up your consumption of this content.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Here's What Mark Zuckerberg Is Offering Top AI Talent","https://www.wired.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-meta-offer-top-ai-talent-300-million/","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 18:48:00 GMT","

As Mark Zuckerberg staffs up Meta's new superintelligence lab, he's offered top tier research talent pay packages of up to $300 million over four years, with more than $100 million in total compensation for the first year, WIRED has learned.

Meta has made at least 10 staggeringly high offers to OpenAI staffers, sources say. One high ranking researcher was pitched on the role of chief scientist but turned it down, according to multiple sources with direct knowledge of the negotiations. While the pay package includes equity, in the first year the stock vests immediately, sources say.

“That's about how much it would take for me to go work at Meta,” says one OpenAI staffer who spoke with WIRED on the condition of anonymity as they aren't authorized to speak publicly about the company. Other employees said that they were weighing the money against the potential impact they could have at Meta in comparison to OpenAI. Several believed their impact would be greater at OpenAI.

“These statements are untrue - the size and structure of these compensation packages have been misrepresented all over the place,” says Meta spokesperson Andy Stone. “Some people have chosen to greatly exaggerate what's happening for their own purposes.”

A senior engineer who spoke to WIRED confirmed their pay was around $850,000 per year at Meta—an impressive sum that pales in comparison to the packages currently on offer. Those in the pay band above this engineer (E7's, in Meta terms) make on average $1.54 million a year, according to user data submitted on Levels.FYI.

Andrew Bosworth, chief technology officer at Meta, said that not everyone is getting a $100 million offer during a Q&A with employees last week. “Look, you guys, the market's hot. It's not that hot. Okay? So it's just a lie,” he said. “We have a small number of leadership roles that we're hiring for, and those people do command a premium.” He added that the $100 million is not a sign-on bonus, but “all these different things” and noted OpenAI is countering the offers.

As a point of comparison, Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, received $79.1 million in total compensation in 2024, most of it in stock, according to a financial filing by the company. Dara Khosrowshahi, the CEO of Uber, made roughly $39.4 million (again, mostly in stock) the same year.

On Monday, Mark Zuckerberg sent a note to Meta staff introducing the new superintelligence team. Alexandr Wang, formerly the CEO of Scale AI, is now Meta's chief AI officer, Zuckerberg said. He's joined by Nat Friedman who previously led GitHub. Together, Wang and Friedman will colead an organization Zuckerberg dubbed the Meta Superintelligence Labs. The company did not name a chief scientist or a chief research officer as part of the announcement. Neither Wang nor Friedman are thought of as researchers, at least in the traditional sense. None of the OpenAI staffers who left for Meta received the $300 million offer, according to a source with knowledge of the contracts.

Zuckerberg told potential recruits they would not have to worry about running out of resources, according to the Wall Street Journal. That's an attractive offer in the AI industry, where access to cutting-edge chips, or GPUs, is highly competitive, and can influence how impactful the research ends up being. At OpenAI, researchers have complained that Altman has been known to promise people access to GPUs, only to feel like there was no follow through from leadership.

Zuckerberg has successfully hired at least seven staffers from OpenAI for the effort—prompting Mark Chen, OpenAI's chief research officer, to send a note to staff over the weekend saying it felt “as if someone has broken into our home and stolen something.” Chen added that while OpenAI is recalibrating its own compensation packages for top talent, it won't do so at the sacrifice of fairness. Chen also said that “a lot more supercomputers are coming online later this year.”

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman followed up with a Slack note on Monday night, slamming Meta's poaching attempts and hinting that OpenAI is working on recalibrating compensation, WIRED reported.

After 13 years of deploying robots into its warehouses, Amazon reached a new milestone.

The tech behemoth now has 1 million robots in its warehouses, the company announced Monday. This one millionth robot was recently delivered to an Amazon fulfillment facility in Japan.

That figure puts Amazon on track to reach another landmark: Its vast network of warehouses may soon have the same number of robots working as people, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal. The WSJ also reported that 75% of Amazon's global deliveries are now assisted in some way by a robot.

TechCrunch reached out to Amazon for more information.

The company also announced it's releasing a new generative AI model called DeepFleet for its warehouse robots. This AI model, which can coordinate the robots' routes within the company's warehouses more efficiently, will help increase the speed of its robotic fleet by 10%, according to Amazon.

The company used Amazon SageMaker — the AWS cloud studio that helps build and deploy AI models — to create DeepFleet. Amazon trained the model on its own warehouse and inventory data.

Amazon's one millionth robot represents more than just a number. The company has improved its fleet of robots in recent years, adding new capabilities and models.

In May, the company unveiled its latest robot, Vulcan. This model has two arms, one designed for rearranging inventory and another with a camera and suction cup to grab items. Most notably, these Vulcan robots have a sense of “touch” that allows it to feel the items it is grabbing, according to Amazon.

In October 2024, the company announced its “next-generation fulfillment centers,” which would include 10x as many robots as their current facilities, in addition to human workers. The first of these new robotic-powered centers opened shortly after in Shreveport, Louisiana, near the Texas border.

Amazon originally started building up its robotic capabilities back in 2012 alongside its acquisition of Kiva Systems.

General Motors sold 4,508 electric Hummer trucks and SUVs in the second quarter in the U.S., putting it close to Ford's F-150 Lightning despite a price gap in the tens of thousands of dollars.

The Hummer sales were part of a banner quarter for GM's electric vehicles, making it one of the only automakers that saw a genuine year-over-year uptick in U.S. EV sales, according to data released Tuesday. The  company sold 17,420 electric Equinox SUVs, 3,056 electric Silverado pickups, 6,549 Blazer EVs, 1,810 Escalade IQ EVs, and 1,524 electric GMC Sierra trucks. 

GM even got a boost from its commercial EV division, BrightDrop, which sold 1,318 of its electric vans during the three-month period, up from 490 last year. Overall, GM's EV sales for the quarter were up 111% despite phasing out the Bolt EV and EUV — although that increase was driven in part by the fact that many of these models were either brand new or not on sale in the second quarter of 2024.

That stands in contrast to how almost every other automaker that sells EVs fared in Q2, at least based on data released so far. Rival Ford saw a 31% drop in U.S. sales of electric vehicles in the second quarter of 2025, led by a collapse of E-Transit vans and declining popularity of the F-150 Lightning. At the same time, sales of its hybrid vehicles jumped more than 23% compared to last year.

Halfway through the year, Ford has sold just 38,988 electric vehicles total — down nearly 12% from where Ford's EV sales stood at the same point in 2024. That's despite overall sales being up, thanks in part to the company's aggressive employee pricing promotion in the face of automotive tariffs.

After a few years of growth, it's now a challenging time for EV sales in the U.S., as the Trump administration threatens to take away federal tax incentives and other related subsidies. Even Hyundai, which has found success with its electric vehicles in the U.S., reported Tuesday that sales of its Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 EVs fell 12% and 8%, respectively, compared to the same period last year. Kia had even worse drops in sales of its EV9 and EV6. Tesla is expected to release similarly grim quarterly sales on Wednesday.

Ford saw a nearly 20% year-over-year drop in Mustang Mach-E sales in the second quarter, down to 10,178 units sold. It sold just 5,842 F-150 Lightnings, a 26% decline. And Ford only sold 418 E-Transit vans, down from 3,410 in the second quarter of 2024. (The company told TechCrunch that E-Transit sales were down as a result of larger fleet orders being placed in the first quarter.) 

President Trump spent the first few months of his second term promising tariffs on the automotive sector, which mostly drove up sales as buyers tried to get ahead of price increases. But that momentum has not lasted for Ford's EVs, which are getting long in the tooth. The Mustang Mach-E first went on sale in late 2020, and the F-150 Lightning hit the market in the middle of 2022. Ford is working on a lower-cost set of EVs, starting with a small truck, but that won't be sold until 2027.

Update: This story and headline have been updated to include sales data from General Motors.

After pushing the TikTok sale date back yet again, President Donald Trump said in an interview on Sunday that he had found a potential buyer for the ByteDance-owned platform.

Though the president said he will not reveal the identities of the buyers for another couple weeks, Bloomberg is reporting that the buyer is a group of investors from Oracle, Blackstone, and VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). According to the report, these investors had made a bid, but it lost momentum amid tensions between the U.S. and China due to Trump's tariff proposals.

Oracle has long been engaged with TikTok as part of its Project Texas initiative to make sure that U.S. user data is stored in the States.

Startups working on AI-powered e-commerce tools often rely on external data or user signals to build and improve their models. However, a company called Remark is taking a different approach by letting thousands of human experts chat with users while they are purchasing items, and then using that knowledge to train models.

Remark also makes those experts “available” all the time by having their AI-powered persona answer questions. Remark said that this resulted in a 10% net revenue gain for partners, which was a great sign for investors.

The startup on Tuesday announced $16 million in Series A funding led by Inspired Capital with participation from Stripe, Neo, Spero Ventures, Shine Capital, and Visible Ventures. This brings the startup's total funding to date to $27 million. Remark plans to use the funds to grow its team of 25 people and spend on model training.

Remark joins a number of startups that are plugging AI into various areas of e-commerce, such as search, try-ons, chatbots, and dynamic page generation that is suited for AI-powered experiences. While these companies operate in different areas, merchants can only spend so much to enhance their online experience. In this market, Remark could have challenges in scaling and competing with other e-commerce startups using AI.

While Remark previously depended on a cut of the sale to generate revenue, the company has moved to a SaaS-based (software-as-a-service) model for better cash flow and now takes a fee based on site traffic.

The company's CEO, Theo Satloff, said that physical stores tend to see high conversion rates of 30% to 35% compared to online stores that convert at roughly 1.5%. With Remark, the startup wanted to change that.

“The reason for low conversion rates on e-commerce sites is that people have a lot of questions when they shop. They have to go on Reddit or ask their friends to get advice about the purchase. In a store, a person with product knowledge helps them, so the conversion rate is high,” he explained. 

“At Remark, we want to bring that kind of expertise to online shopping for our partners,” Satloff said in a call with TechCrunch.

When a user visits a site that uses Remark, the startup's tool generates a set of dynamic questions that can drive the user's purchasing decision. If a user is looking for pots and pans, the site could ask what kind of stovetop they have, or if they use diesel, induction, or gas. When the user clicks on one of these questions, a chat interface opens where they're matched with an expert who can offer advice about buying an item.

Remark matches an expert with a user based on skill set and locale, it says. If an expert is not available, the user is matched with an AI bot based on those experts who can help them with their shopping. 

The company is slowly expanding its expert network. Satloff said Remark works with a variety of accreditation agencies to verify the expertise of the people who work with them. (This is akin to Airbnb adding various experience providers for its platform.)

Experts are paid for their time on the platform on a per-chat basis. They are also paid when their AI persona converts a sale. While the startup didn't provide an exact figure for the average earnings that an expert receives, it said its top 20% earn $60,000 to $70,000 per year by spending more than 15 to 20 hours a week offering advice.

The catch is that the human expert needs to be alert to requests from users. When a user activates a chat, experts get a notification on their phone on Remark's app, and they have five to eight seconds to claim the chat and respond to the buyer.

Remark also dynamically rewrites the content on the website based on the user's conversation with the expert and what they might be looking for. 

The company has been growing quickly. Following its $10 million fundraise in 2024, Remark has seen 4x revenue growth. It also increased its network of experts from 50,000 to 60,000.

Kamran Ali, a principal at Inspired Capital, said that Remark's utilization of human insights was an important factor in the VC firm investing in the startup.

“As AI continues to take over the internet, we're going to continue to be inundated with just a ton of AI-generated content everywhere we go. The amount of AI-generated content we see today is dramatically more than a year ago, and there's no end in sight. So, having human insights and preferences will actually be at a premium, and that's what attracted us to invest in Remark,” he told TechCrunch over a call.

Remark is now working on the ability to generate blog posts that recommend products based on expert conversations. Later, it plans to send personalized follow-up emails to users about a conversation they had with an expert.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","Cloudflare will now, by default, block AI bots from crawling its clients' websites","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/01/1119498/cloudflare-will-now-by-default-block-ai-bots-from-crawling-its-clients-websites/","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 10:00:57 GMT","

The company will also introduce a ""pay-per-crawl"" system to give users more fine-grained control over how AI companies can access their sites.

The internet infrastructure company Cloudflare announced today that it will now default to blocking AI bots from visiting websites it hosts. Cloudflare will also give clients the ability to manually allow or ban these AI bots on a case-by-case basis, and it will introduce a so-called “pay-per-crawl” service that clients can use to receive compensation every time an AI bot wants to scoop up their website's contents.

The bots in question are a type of web crawler, an algorithm that walks across the internet to digest and catalogue online information on each website. In the past, web crawlers were most commonly associated with gathering data for search engines, but developers now use them to gather data they need to build and use AI systems. 

However, such systems don't provide the same opportunities for monetization and credit as search engines historically have. AI models draw from a great deal of data on the web to generate their outputs, but these data sources are often not credited, limiting the creators' ability to make money from their work. Search engines that feature AI-generated answers may include links to original sources, but they may also reduce people's interest in clicking through to other sites and could even usher in a “zero-click” future.

“Traditionally, the unspoken agreement was that a search engine could index your content, then they would show the relevant links to a particular query and send you traffic back to your website,” Will Allen, Cloudflare's head of AI privacy, control, and media products, wrote in an email to MIT Technology Review. “That is fundamentally changing.”

Generally, creators and publishers want to decide how their content is used, how it's associated with them, and how they are paid for it. Cloudflare claims its clients can now allow or disallow crawling for each stage of the AI life cycle (in particular, training, fine-tuning, and inference) and white-list specific verified crawlers. Clients can also set a rate for how much it will cost AI bots to crawl their website. 

In a press release from Cloudflare, media companies like the Associated Press and Time and forums like Quora and Stack Overflow voiced support for the move. “Community platforms that fuel LLMs should be compensated for their contributions so they can invest back in their communities,” Stack Overflow CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar said in the release.

Crawlers are supposed to obey a given website's directions (provided through a robots.txt file) to determine whether they can crawl there, but some AI companies have been accused of ignoring these instructions. 

Cloudflare already has a bot verification system where AI web crawlers can tell websites who they work for and what they want to do. For these, Cloudflare hopes its system can facilitate good-faith negotiations between AI companies and website owners. For the less honest crawlers, Cloudflare plans to use its experience dealing with coordinated denial-of-service attacks from bots to stop them. 

“A web crawler that is going across the internet looking for the latest content is just another type of bot—so all of our work to understand traffic and network patterns for the clearly malicious bots helps us understand what a crawler is doing,” wrote Allen.

Cloudflare had already developed other ways to deter unwanted crawlers, like allowing websites to send them down a path of AI-generated fake web pages to waste their efforts. While this approach will still apply for the truly bad actors, the company says it hopes its new services can foster better relationships between AI companies and content producers. 

There's an accelerating cat-and-mouse game between web publishers and AI crawlers, and we all stand to lose. 

Some caution that a default ban on AI crawlers could interfere with noncommercial uses, like research. In addition to gathering data for AI systems and search engines, crawlers are also used by web archiving services, for example. 

“Not all AI systems compete with all web publishers. Not all AI systems are commercial,” says Shayne Longpre, a PhD candidate at the MIT Media Lab who works on data provenance. “Personal use and open research shouldn't be sacrificed here.”

For its part, Cloudflare aims to protect internet openness by helping enable web publishers to make more sustainable deals with AI companies. “By verifying a crawler and its intent, a website owner has more granular control, which means they can leave it more open for the real humans if they'd like,” wrote Allen. 

Adoption of the tech has civil liberties advocates alarmed, especially as the government vows to expand surveillance of protesters and students.

AlphaEvolve uses large language models to find new algorithms that outperform the best human-made solutions for data center management, chip design, and more.

In 2019, Karen Hao, a senior reporter with MIT Technology Review, pitched writing a story about a then little-known company, OpenAI. This is what happened next.

Has a late-night cheese session ever seemed to send you down your own personal Nightmare on Elm Street? You're probably not alone. Research out today has revealed a link between lactose intolerance and a higher risk of bad dreams.

Scientists in Canada conducted the study by surveying college students. People who reported having regular nightmares and poorer sleep in general were also more likely to report having food allergies, including lactose intolerance, they found. The researchers speculate that the distress caused by people's stomach issues can seep into our non-waking hours.

“The results we obtained confirmed our hypothesis that lactose intolerance is indeed predictive of disturbed dreaming and nightmares,” study co-author Russ Powell, a psychologist and professor emeritus at MacEwan University in Edmonton, Alberta, told Gizmodo.

Do You Always Remember Your Dreams? Researchers May Know Why

The idea that the foods we eat, particularly cheese or other dairy products, can worsen our sleep is hardly new. In the early 1900s, for example, American cartoonist Winsor McCay created a popular newspaper comic strip—Dream of the Rarebit Fiend—that routinely featured people getting nightmares or strange dreams after eating something less than agreeable. Often, this trigger food was a Welsh rarebit, a popular British dish of cheese on toast.

But according to Powell, this phenomenon hasn't really been studied much scientifically. A decade ago, this same team published a survey finding that roughly 20% of participants reported having bizarre dreams they felt were connected to eating certain foods or eating late at night, with many blaming dairy products specifically. In their latest study, Powell and his colleagues were hoping to replicate their earlier findings, in addition to digging a bit deeper into the reasons behind people's cheese-flavored nightmares.

The researchers surveyed over 1,000 college students (more than twice the sample size of the 2015 study) about their dietary and sleeping habits. About 40% of respondents felt that some foods or late-night chowing affected their sleep, with 25% feeling their diets worsened their sleep. This time, only 5.5% specifically blamed foods for affecting the content of their dreams, but dairy, spicy foods, and sweets were commonly blamed culprits among those who did. The researchers also found that self-reported lactose intolerance was associated with more severe nightmares and poorer sleep, as were other food allergies. Unsurprisingly, lactose intolerance was associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, while people who reported less healthy diets in general tended to have more nightmares and to have more difficulty recalling their dreams.

The team's findings were published Tuesday in Frontiers in Psychology (both the current and the 2015 study directly reference Dream of the Rarebit Fiend in their title).

Frequent Nightmares Linked to Faster Aging and Premature Death

As anyone with lactose intolerance knows, indulging a dairy craving can cause plenty of GI pain and bloating. And the researchers reason that these symptoms can stir people awake or more subtly ruin their dreams—an explanation that might extend to other similar kinds of pain.

“It may be that GI distress, in comparison to other types of physical distress, has a particularly strong impact upon sleeping and dreaming. Menstrual cramping, for example, has also been shown to increase the likelihood of disturbed dreaming,” Powell said. He further theorizes that since GI symptoms can be caused by ingesting poison, our dairy nightmares might be the body's way to keep itself alert in case of medical emergency.

The researchers would like to confirm their research experimentally, such as a trial that directly compares how lactose-intolerant people sleep and dream after either eating or avoiding dairy. Powell believes it would also be interesting to study whether food sensitivities could be directly contributing to some people's nightmare disorders.

Around one-third of Americans have trouble digesting lactose, though not everyone feels sick after having some. And given how annoying lactose intolerance already is, these findings may offer further incentive to stay away from the late-night dairy. I personally know that I'll be more likely to reach for a scoop of evening sorbet over the ice cream next time around.

This is very much an early look—no actors, no plot teases, just a glimpse of a certain key location in William Gibson‘s cyberpunk tale Neuromancer. But “near-future dystopia by way of 1984” is captured correctly here, and that bodes very well for the Apple TV+ series that is, as the tin advertises, currently in production.

And this isn't just a random drop to increase hype for the show, which does not yet have a release date. Neuromancer was published July 1, 1984. Happy anniversary to Gibson and his influential book, and enjoy this brief tease of what's to come.

Apple TV+ is definitely the best-case streaming scenario for this project—need we remind you how much we love its sci-fi content, including the standout Isaac Asimov adaptation Foundation?—and we're dying to see more.

Neuromancer will run 10 episodes; it stars Callum Turner and follows “a damaged, top-rung super-hacker named Case who is thrust into a web of digital espionage and high-stakes crime with his partner Molly (played by Briana Middleton), a razor-girl assassin with mirrored eyes aiming to pull a heist on a corporate dynasty with untold secrets,” according to an Apple press release.

The rest of the cast includes Joseph Lee, Mark Strong, Cleménce Poésy, Peter Sarsgaard, Emma Laird, Dane DeHaan, André De Shields, Max Irons, and Marc Menchaca. It's created for TV by Graham Roland (Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan, Dark Winds) and JD Dillard (Devotion, The Outsider, Sleight). Roland is the showrunner, Dillard is directing the pilot, and they're both among the show's executive producers.

What do you think of this first teaser for Neuromancer? Are you intrigued, or is it too short to tell?

Meta is one step closer to releasing AR smart glasses with built-in displays. These will not be the Orion smart glasses that the company showed off last year (glasses that reportedly cost $10,000 to make a single pair, but more likely a watered-down version, according to leaked images and videos of the so-called “Meta Ceres” (codenamed “Meta Hypernova”) AR glasses.

X user @Lunayian (via RoadtoVR) shared several images and videos of what they claim are the Cerese smart glasses and their corresponding electromyography (EMG) wristband controller. At first glance, the two devices look like a pair of Ray-Ban Meta AI smart glasses and a Whoop fitness band. Having tried the impressive Orion prototype last year, these images appear to show frames that are slimmer and more stylish, and a wristband controller that's more refined and subtle.

All of the media was reportedly discovered in “early firmware.” Ceres could be Meta's first pair of AR smart glasses capable of replacing—or more likely semi-replacing—your phone. Here's that EMG band in action, showing a pinching gesture. Purported marketing copy says that you should be able to feel a buzz on your wrist when the “band detects a gesture.” The X user also said the wristband may support handwriting; Meta is reportedly testing the feature, but it may not ship at launch.

There's also a touch-sensitive panel on the temples of Celeste where a user can touch to capture photos and video.

Similar to Orion, Celeste might even let you game—just a little bit. @Lunayian found a short video and logo referencing a minigame called “Meta Hypernova.”

Ultimately, Meta's main goal is to release a pair of AR smartglasses that let you open several apps at once. In my Orion demo, I could use multiple apps, including Instagram, a web browser, and a video call, and see them all floating transparently in front of my eyeballs. The secondary goal is to get the price down to something that people will pony up for. According to Bloomberg, Meta is targeting around $1,000 for its first AR glasses. That's not throwaway money, but it's also not $3,500 for an Apple Vision Pro.

There's also still a lot we don't know. Orion required a rather large wireless compute puck to handle much of its graphics processing. Will Ceres need a separate puck or rely on a phone for processing? Will people want to use a wristband that will need to be charged on its own?

The veracity of these leaks can't be confirmed, but someone would have had to go through a lot of trouble just to fake them. It's likely we'll find out more at Meta's annual Connect developer conference happening September 17 through 18. Mark Zuckerberg is hellbent on beating everyone to AR glasses. And he kind of has to—the competition is appearing larger and larger in his rearview mirror. It's been long-rumored that Tim Cook is pushing for a pair of AR glasses, though the company settled with Vision Pro first because the technology to shrink AR into a pair of eyewear isn't there yet. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel announced at AWE last month that the company's first AR glasses are coming next year. Without showing any images or videos, he described them as “lightweight” and “immersive,” which we can only take to mean they won't look like the goofy, oversized (but standalone) developer versions of Specs (see below) that Snap has been letting devs and creators fiddle with. And, of course, Google is going to come guns blazing with Android XR, which will likely launch with hardware from a bunch of brands, just like other Android phones and tablet devices.

Time is of the essence for Meta and Zuck if they really want to own our faces as the next computing battleground. Meta fumbled big time with the whole metaverse that never materialized in VR, but now it's pivoted everything—pouring tens of billions of dollars a year—into AR and AI. Zuck and company can shove Meta AI into every app it owns, but at the end of the day, they're still apps experienced mostly through phone screens. Ceres could be the first device to change that and chip away at the phone's dominance.

A new generative AI model is helping boost travel efficiency

Amazon has revealed that the company has just deployed its one millionth robot in its operations. The milestone droid was deployed to a fulfilment center in Japan. In a press release, the company also revealed it has a new generative AI foundation model that will help improve robot fleet travel efficiency by 10%, supporting faster delivery times and reducing costs for consumers.

Crucially, WSJ reports that Amazon is now on the brink of having more robots in its warehouses than humans. Per the report, the majority of Amazon's 1.56 million employees are warehouse staff, but the biggest cohort of Amazon's ""employees"" could soon be its army of robots, which it uses to pick orders from shelves, move goods ready for packaging, sort items, and more.

Amazon says its new generative AI foundation model, DeepFleet, will make its entire fleet of robots smarter and more efficient. It will be used to coordinate the movement of its robots across its fulfilment network to improve the travel time of the fleet by 10%. That might not sound like a lot, but that's a colossal saving when you consider the magnitude of Amazon's business. Ultimately, that should mean lower costs and faster delivery times for consumers.

Amazon says DeepFleet is essentially an intelligent traffic management system for its robots, which move like cars across a congested city.

The company has come a long way from its original warehouse robots. In 2012, a robot could move inventory shelves across the floor of a warehouse. Now, it has an entire fleet of different models. Specifically, Amazon highlighted the Hercules, which can move 1,250 pounds of inventory, and Pegasus, which uses a precision conveyor belt to handle individual packages. There's also Proteus, Amazon's first fully autonomous mobile robot, which can move around employees while moving heavy carts.

While the burgeoning future of AI and robots might seem like a threat to jobs in some instances, Amazon says the opposite is true. The company claims it has helped upskill 700,000 employees to work with more advanced technologies, and that robot grunt work is freeing up its employees to earn more technical skills. Those 700,000 workers now earn more money in jobs that can include working with robotics, with completely new jobs being created.

Amazon one day hopes to turn warehouse robots into assistants that can even respond to verbal commands from employees, and is also testing a humanoid robot with legs, arms, and a head.

Is the RTX 5050 a worthwhile upgrade?

Hong Kong-based GPU manufacturer Inno3D, which shares a parent company with Zotac, has just released benchmarks for the RTX 5050. @haruzake5719 shared the performance comparison on X, where the benchmarks showed the new GPU outperforming the RTX 3060 and running almost on par with the last-generation RTX 4060. The RTX 5050 is Nvidia's entry-level 50-series graphics card, sporting only 8GB of slower GDDR6 and a maximum TDP of 130 watts.

This GPU launched last week and is only priced at $249, allowing budget gamers to buy into the RTX 50-series family for 1080p gaming. Although the RTX 5060 also has 8GB of VRAM, it uses GDDR7 and features more CUDA cores for better performance. It also has a higher MSRP of $299, and you can expect add-in board partners to put a premium on some variants. The RTX 5050 goes head-to-head with the Intel B580, which launched in December last year, and has the same price. However, the latter has 4GB more VRAM and a larger memory bus of 192-bit (over the RTX 5050's 128-bit memory bus).

Inno3D's tests show the RTX 5050 outperforming the RTX 4060 in several 3DMark tests, including Steel Nomad, Speed Way, Port Royal, Fire Strike Ultra, and Fire Strike. The latter garnered better scores in TimeSpy Extreme and TimeSpy, but its advantage sits at less than 10%. The company then ran benchmarks on four games, and although the RTX 4060 exceeded the new GPU in all titles, the FPS numbers weren't that far off.

It seems that the budget gamers will get a base-level 50-series GPU that can perform almost as well as a higher-tier GPU from the previous generation. However, if you already have an RTX 4060 or even an RTX 3060, the RTX 5050 might not be an upgrade for you. This is built for those who are running older GTX 10-series or 16-series GPUs, or entry-level RTX 20-series graphics cards.

The Intel B580 is an attractive alternative, though, because of its higher VRAM — if you can find one, that is. Or if you can spare an extra $180, consider getting the RTX 5060 Ti (16GB) instead, as you'll likely struggle with just 8GB of VRAM. We recommend holding off on any purchases until you've seen an in-depth review on the RTX 5050 — that way, you can make the most of your hard-earned money.

About 11% of the American population had diabetes in 2021, with type 2 diabetes accounting for 90% to 95% of these cases.

Fasting diets, which involve alternating periods of fasting and eating, are effective in alleviating the symptoms of type 2 diabetes and can be easier to follow than reducing daily calorie intake over a long time.

A new study, conducted using real-world evidence, shows that individuals with type 2 diabetes who follow a fasting diet involving restricted energy intake for 5 consecutive days per month exhibit improvements in blood glucose (sugar) levels, weight loss, and a reduced reliance on diabetes medications.

This fasting program has been patented by L-Nutra, a nutrient technology company. One of the study authors, William Hsu, MD, an endocrinologist and Chief Medical Officer at L-Nutra, told Medical News Today that:

“This study demonstrates how the fasting-mimicking diet (FMD), when combined with physician oversight and registered dietitian (RD) coaching, can be safely and effectively implemented in real-world clinical settings to manage type 2 diabetes.”

The researchers presented these results at the American Diabetes Association's 85th Scientific Sessions on June 20, 2025. The findings are yet to appear in a peer-reviewed journal.

The treatment for type 2 diabetes typically involves a combination of lifestyle modifications and medications. Lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes and increased physical activity, help lower blood glucose levels and facilitate weight loss.

While medications such as metformin and GLP-1 agonists facilitate the management of diabetes symptoms, only lifestyle changes, such as dietary modifications, can lead to disease remission.

Studies have shown that restricting daily calorie intake is effective in managing blood sugar levels and reducing weight in individuals with type 2 diabetes. However, adhering to such a diet over the long term is challenging.

Additionally, the body adapts to long-term calorie restriction, resulting in a slower metabolism, which makes sustained weight loss more challenging.

Instead, various forms of fasting diets, involving alternating periods of fasting and unrestricted food intake, have been suggested to be easier to adhere to while alleviating diabetes symptoms.

Fasting triggers a stress response in cells and the body, promoting healthy aging by reducing inflammation and oxidative damage, while enhancing metabolism.

Fasting diets may involve either restricting calorie intake during certain hours of the day, known as intermittent fasting, or during specific days of the week or month, referred to as periodic fasting.

The fasting-mimicking diet is a form of periodic fasting that involves restricted calorie intake for 4 to 7 consecutive days per month.

Researchers have developed the fasting mimicking diet to simulate the beneficial health effects of water-only fasting, which involves only water intake during a 24 to 72-hour period. In contrast to water-only fasting, a fasting-mimicking diet allows for limited calorie intake during the fasting period, making adherence less challenging. 

The authors of the current study have developed a patented low-calorie, plant-based diet that is low in sugar and protein, but rich in healthy unsaturated fats and fiber.

A previous study demonstrated that a 5-day fasting-mimicking diet also leads to a decrease in blood sugar and insulin levels, while increasing the levels of ketone bodies. 

Moreover, a recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated that a 5-day fasting mimicking diet combined with medications was more effective than medications alone in improving blood glucose control and reducing medication reliance. 

These results were observed under highly controlled conditions in a clinical trial, including strict criteria for patient inclusion and exclusion. This makes it essential to evaluate the real-world efficacy of this intervention.

In the present study, researchers evaluated the real-world benefits of integrating a fasting-mimicking diet into routine care for individuals with type 2 diabetes.

The present study included data from patients enrolled in a diabetes management program that involved following a monthly 5-day fasting-mimicking diet under the supervision of physicians and registered dietitians.

Patients were enrolled in the study on a rolling basis, and data were collected from those who had completed at least 3 or 6 months of the program.

At the end of 3 and 6 months, the fasting-mimicking diet was effective in facilitating weight loss and reducing glycated hemoglobin levels, a marker of blood glucose levels. The fasting-mimicking diet also helped a greater percentage of participants achieve blood glucose control at these time points than at the time of enrolment.

The fasting-mimicking diet also reduced reliance on medications for blood glucose control, while still resulting in high levels of engagement in the program.

In addition, Hsu noted:

 “Most participants are able to integrate the fasting-mimicking diet into their daily lives without significant disruption. Because it's a 5-day monthly intervention rather than a daily regimen, many find it feasible to complete even with work and family obligations, especially with RD support to tailor practical strategies for adherence and personalization.”

While the fasting-mimicking diet can be safely undertaken by most individuals with type 2 diabetes, patients should consult a physician before starting such a diet.

Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN, a preventive cardiology dietitian and heart health expert at Entirely Nourished, not involved in this study, expressed some caution about the findings.

“While the positive effects of the FMD program on weight and HbA1c [a marker of blood sugar] are promising, it is important to note that the intervention was associated with common signs of energy deficit — including fatigue, headache, dizziness, and nausea — in a substantial number of participants during the 5-day fasting period,“ Routhenstein told MNT.

“Although these symptoms resolved between cycles, they may pose risks for certain individuals, especially those with coexisting health conditions or frailty,“ she pointed out.

Hsu also cautioned that: “While the program accommodates most individuals with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome, certain conditions are exclusionary, such as recent cardiovascular events, end-stage diabetes complications, frailty, a BMI under 18, or allergies to FMD ingredients. The program is designed to prioritize safety while expanding access to innovative nutrition-based care for metabolic health.”

Finally, Routhenstein advised that “the inclusion of lifestyle advice with the option to consult a dietitian may have influenced some of the study findings.”

 July 01, 2025  

She saw an angel of mercy. You saw a sandwich.

Such is the fun of visiting a museum or art gallery with a friend and gazing at an abstract painting together and then realizing you have different interpretations of it.

The funny thing is, neither one of you has to be right, or even close, to benefit from the experience.

Art history experts would attribute this experience to a long-held idea in the art world known as “Beholder's Share.” It suggests that individuals actively engage in creating meaning when they're looking at art and that meaning is based on one's personal memories and associations. In other words, an artist never really “finishes” a work of art on their own. Beholder's Share says the artwork is completed by the person viewing it.

The mood-boosting effects of viewing art are well-known, but new brain scan research on Beholder's Share — as well as a more rigorous review of existing data showing the mental health benefits of viewing art — suggested that art's influence on our own creativity, critical thinking, and happiness could be more therapeutic than originally thought.

A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences scientifically supports the notion of Beholder's Share, its authors said. Using functional MRI (fMRI), researchers from Columbia University, New York City, discovered that people use their brains differently when viewing abstract art vs when they look at realistic art, and brain activity is more varied — more person-specific — when viewing abstract paintings. “People responded more subjectively to abstract paintings” compared to realistic paintings, study author Celia E. Durkin, PhD, said.

What's more, a specific area of the brain appeared to be involved when they viewed abstract art. Ariana Anderson, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles, who shared thoughts about the study but was not involved with the research, said, “Responses were more dissimilar for abstract art in those areas of the brain typically associated with the Default Mode Network.”

The authors had a couple of aims when they were devising their study, Durkin said. “Our two key goals were to establish whether we do indeed interpret abstract art more subjectively than representational art and whether and where we might see evidence of individual contribution to the meaning of paintings in the brain.” They wondered, would they see patterns of brain activity corresponding to Beholder's Share, and how would these patterns vary across individuals?

To answer these questions, Durkin said they needed to both “operationalize and manipulate” the Beholder's Share (the subjective experience) of an image. “To manipulate the Beholder's Share in a controlled way, we used abstract and representational paintings by the same artist, with the logic that abstract paintings would elicit more of the Beholder's Share,” she said. “We operationalized the Beholder's Share as dissimilarity across subjects and compared this dissimilarity between abstract and representational paintings, both in written descriptions and neural responses measured with fMRI.”

To first test whether people responded more variably to abstract vs figurative (realistic) art, the researchers collected written captions from an online sample of 30 participants who viewed a total of 164 paintings (82 in each category). The paintings were by abstract expressionist artists — such as the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian — who painted lifelike art early in their careers but whose work evolved into a more abstract style over time. The representational paintings included a recognizable object, person, or scene. The abstract paintings did not feature recognizable images (picture shapes, blobs, and splashes of color). The captions varied more for the abstract paintings, “suggesting abstract art elicits differences in verbalizable interpretation across participants,” the authors wrote.

For the second part of the study, 29 healthy participants were shown abstract and figurative paintings while they were scanned with fMRI and asked to make subjective decisions about each painting they viewed. The researchers analyzed participants' brain activity in anatomical regions based on the Harvard-Oxford Atlas, commonly used in neuroimaging for brain mapping. For each painting, the authors said they “computed the dissimilarity in regional activations across participants” and discovered that brain patterns linked to responses differed across participants significantly more when they were looking at the abstract paintings compared to when they viewed the realistic paintings. The more abstract a painting, the more dissimilar the participants' brain patterns were.

The scientists also performed several control analyses, Durkin noted.

“Figurative art, being more concrete and recognizable, tends to elicit more consistent brain responses across individuals, especially in early visual areas,” Anderson said. This would include the visual cortex, located at the back of the brain.

The study results suggested that viewing abstract art goes beyond simply liking or not liking it, the authors wrote, and that there is a complexity to art appreciation shaped by a person's past experiences and personal context — as the Beholder's Share theory posits.

While the authors didn't quantify “how” brain patterns vary during art viewing, Durkin said they did quantify “where” in the brain these patterns varied. When observing abstract art, the study indicates it involves the brain's Default Mode Network (which functions across numerous brain regions, including the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes).

Anderson described the Default Mode Network as “a set of brain regions that are more active when you're at rest, daydreaming, remembering, or thinking about yourself or others — for example, internally focused tasks.” She said, “It is associated with mind wandering and creativity.” Anderson said since abstract art lacks clear visual references, it makes sense that “people rely more on personal interpretation, emotions, and imagination, all functions tied to the Default Mode Network.”

Edward A. Vessel, PhD, Eugene Surowitz assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at The City University of New York, New York City, said, “I think the Default Mode Network is also partly, not fully, but partly responsible for the pleasure we get from the act of sense-making, with art in particular.”

Vessel's research has included looking at the idea of shared taste and why it is that two people agree or not. He has published previous work showing that there tends to be less agreement across people for judgments of cultural artifacts, like artwork and architecture. But there is more degree of shared taste for natural landscapes or judgments of faces, he said.

The study findings also suggest that more ambiguity in a painting activates regions in the Default Mode Network, the authors wrote. This parallels ideas that Eric R. Kandel, MD, shared during a talk about Beholder's Share in 2013. Kandel, 95 years old, won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2000 and is recognized for identifying the physiological changes that occur in the brain during memory formation and storage.

In his 2013 talk, he said, “Ambiguity is what brings out difference of interpretation” and pointed to the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. While it's not abstract, he noted the centuries-old debate about it: Is she smiling or is she not? In the same YouTube talk, he said, “The painter exercises a dramatic amount of creativity in doing a portrait, but you yourself generate a fair amount of creativity reconstructing it in your head and reconstructing it in a way that is unique for you and slightly different for me.”

Viewing art, in a general sense, has always been regarded as a net positive when it comes to mental health — inspiring creativity, critical thinking, and boosting mood.

A new review of 38 studies aimed to collect previous research on visual art and also establish better study protocols going forward. The study covered nearly 7000 people and found that viewing art can improve eudemonic well-being — reflection, empowerment, identity maintenance, and building meaning in life.

This builds on a 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) report examining more than 3000 studies on the benefits of art that resulted in the WHO suggesting art as a social determinant of health.

All this to suggest: More is better, and maybe the more we experience art, especially abstract art, the more we'll begin to understand how it affects us personally.

“I can't answer this definitively, but I think so,” Durkin said. “There is research showing that experience with abstract art can change how we interact with it and how much we like it.”

And more: A 2023 study in Nature suggested that arts-based programs in schools can enhance creativity in teens. Another recent small study involving 42 students from three universities suggested that participation in extracurricular activities, including painting and drawing, was positively linked to levels of creativity.

Vessel said, “Within the field of neuroaesthetics and empirical aesthetics, I have started to adopt a position that everything is driven by learning. It's not like we're born with any kind of a priori or hedonic marking for certain features, right?” And what people find aesthetically pleasing may change across a lifetime as they continue to learn and be exposed to new visual experiences, he added.

Experts at The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, recommend a four-step process involving looking, describing, thinking, and connecting to encourage closer observation and deeper thinking when looking at art.

Stanford experts advise doing a bit of research on artists and artworks before visiting a gallery or museum. Or when viewing a painting with a figure, try to place yourself inside the frame with them and think about the painting from their perspective.

Wandering the virtual halls of a museum may have an impact on well-being and art appreciation, too. The Louvre, the Met, the Tate, and many more museums offer digital access to their collections.

COMMENTARY

Charles P. Vega, MD, FAAFP

DISCLOSURES |  July 01, 2025  

This is a clinical scenario drawn from my own practice. I'll tell you what I plan to do, but I'm most interested in crowdsourcing a response from all of you to collectively determine best practice. So please answer the polling question and contribute your thoughts in the comments, whether you agree or disagree.

You are on call at 10:30 PM on a Friday and receive a message regarding possible urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is a 34-year-old woman with a history of obesity and dyslipidemia. She reports a 1-day history of dysuria with slight increase in frequency of urination. The urine appears cloudy but there has been no blood. The patient feels tired but denies fever or back pain.

The patient's current medications include rosuvastatin. She indicates that she experienced similar symptoms to her current complaints about 9 months ago, and she improved after a course of antibiotics that lasted “about 10 days.” Prior to that, her only other UTI occurred 6 years ago during pregnancy.

The only in-person clinical care available at this hour is the emergency department (ED). The urgent care center in your practice will open in 9.5 hours.

In this case, I would choose to treat now and not delay symptom resolution. 

The lifetime prevalence of UTI among women in the United States is between 50% and 60% and increases with age. The prevalence of uncomplicated UTIs, which are defined below, peaks between 18 and 39 years of age among women. In a retrospective analysis from the United Kingdom, 21% of patients aged 65 years or older had at least one UTI over a 10-year period.

While complications of UTIs are rare among women without significant comorbidity, even uncomplicated UTIs can have a negative effect on quality of life. The domains most affected by UTI include sexual function, sleep, exercise, and physical labor. 

So, our patient is facing a common health issue associated with significant adverse consequences. What is the best approach to management for this patient?

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), along with the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, published guidelines for the management of UTI in 2010. The authors of this guideline reiterate the common symptoms of UTI (ie, dysuria, urinary frequency, hesitancy, urgency, pain/discomfort, bladder spasms, and hematuria) and stress evaluation for uncomplicated UTI. 

Uncomplicated UTI consists of typical UTI symptoms with the absence of fever, flank pain, or signs of pyelonephritis. Uncomplicated UTI typically occurs in immunocompetent, nonpregnant women with no anatomical or physiologic abnormalities of the genitourinary tract, such as stones and strictures, and no permanent or intermittent catheterization.

The IDSA also stresses evaluation for past history of UTI. Recurrent UTI is defined by at least two culture-proven UTIs in the past 6 months or three in the past year.

Our patient does not meet the criteria for complicated or recurrent UTI. Therefore, she does not require urinalysis or urine culture to initiate antibiotic therapy. The guidelines recommend urine dipstick testing or urinalysis/culture when the diagnosis of UTI is in doubt.

Generally, there is no single symptom or sign that effectively rules “in” or “out” a diagnosis of UTI. In a systematic review, the presence of dysuria, frequency, and urgency had a higher sensitivity than specificity, whereas hematuria was more specific than sensitive. Overall, empirical treatment of uncomplicated UTI among symptomatic women is the most cost-effective approach to management, but it does raise the possibility of overprescribing antibiotics and contributing to antibiotic resistance.

There is no absolutely right or wrong answer for this patient. In addition to the brief history provided in her case, I would obtain a menstrual and sexual history to assess the possibility of pregnancy and ask about any additional vaginal symptoms the patient may be experiencing, especially as the presence of vaginal discharge would reduce the likelihood of a UTI. With that information in hand, I feel that treating her empirically is the best choice.

Has anyone received a call like this on a Friday night? If so, what did you do? And has your practice evolved over time? Your opinion may differ from my treatment plan, so please share! We also did not address which antibiotic to choose for this patient, so I will follow up on your comments and elaborate on some established and new treatments for UTI in my next commentary. Thanks for reading and reacting!","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Published (DOI: 10.1136/wjps-2025-001026) on May 12, 2025, in World Journal of Pediatric Surgery, researchers from Geneva University Hospitals conducted the first scoping review of BA screening efforts across Europe. Their findings reveal a patchwork landscape: while countries like Switzerland, France, and Germany have introduced national SCC programs, most others lag behind or rely solely on localized pilots. This review highlights both systemic inertia and promising technologies—such as AI-enabled apps—that could bridge the gap in diagnosis and care, advocating for Europe to rethink and revitalize its approach to neonatal liver screening.

This review assessed a wide range of data—from published literatures to digital health tools—on three major screening strategies: SCC, serum bilirubin testing, and biochemical profiling. Switzerland was the first country in Europe to launch a national SCC program, reducing the median age of surgery and eventually integrating the card into newborn health booklets. France followed through a parent-led advocacy campaign, while Germany only recently mandated SCC use nationwide. Elsewhere, efforts remain sporadic. Studies consistently show SCC's effectiveness improves dramatically when accompanied by clear referral guidance. Yet many pediatricians still resist its use, citing workload and psychological concerns. Meanwhile, the UK has led research on bilirubin screening, showing exceptional accuracy—but has failed to move from research to policy due to logistical and financial barriers. Recent breakthroughs such as Italy's PopòApp and Germany's AI-powered stool image analysis show strong potential for improving accuracy and scalability. Together, these insights suggest that Europe has both the tools and the knowledge—but not yet the will—to implement widespread BA screening.

Europe has no shortage of expertise, evidence, or technology—what's missing is coordinated action. We've seen how something as simple as a color card can shift outcomes dramatically. Add digital tools and clinical buy-in, and we could revolutionize early diagnosis for thousands of infants. But time is of the essence—each delay costs lives.""

Professor Barbara E. Wildhaber, senior author of the study

A unified European strategy could turn the tide against BA-related infant mortality. Combining SCC with digital apps and AI can provide low-cost, high-reach solutions for families and frontline clinicians. Serum bilirubin testing, though more expensive, captures a wider spectrum of liver diseases and could complement SCC-based programs. Countries may benefit most from hybrid screening models tailored to their healthcare infrastructure. Crucially, any technical rollout must be paired with education, awareness, and strong political advocacy. With the right alignment of tools, policy, and public will, Europe can catch up—and catch the infants who need help most.

A new study has identified early-pregnancy gut microbiota signatures associated with the development of gestational diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disorder that carries substantial risks to both maternal and fetal health. The study, published in the American Society for Microbiology journal Microbiology Spectrum, provides new avenues for gestational diabetes prevention and management.

Gestational diabetes is a prevalent metabolic disorder characterized by abnormal glucose metabolism, primarily in the mid to late stages of pregnancy. Early intervention for gestational diabetes can substantially reduce complications for both mother and baby. Gestational diabetes significantly increases the risk of maternal complications such as gestational hypertension, polyhydramnios, and cesarean delivery, while also posing long-term health risks for the fetus, including asphyxia at birth and increased susceptibility to obesity and diabetes in adulthood.

In the new study, researchers from The Second Hospital, Southern Medical University, and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, all in Guangzhou, China, set out to identify gut microbiota dysbiosis that is strongly linked to the onset and progression of gestational diabetes that may serve as a critical early-warning biomarker. The scientists analyzed the fecal microbiota of 61 pregnant women during their first trimester of pregnancy using 16S rRNA sequencing. They then correlated these microbial profiles with oral glucose tolerance test results at 24-28 weeks of gestation and clinical delivery outcomes.

The researchers discovered that there were significant differences in gut microbiota composition between those with gestational diabetes and women who had healthy pregnancies. Based on their findings, the researchers developed an early diagnostic model for gestational diabetes, based on genus-level markers, with high diagnostic precision.

""These findings suggest that microbiota-based tools could enable early, non-invasive detection of gestational diabetes mellitus, offering new opportunities for prevention and personalized management,"" write the study authors. ""This research highlights the role of the gut microbiome in pregnancy and has important implications for improving maternal and fetal health outcomes.""

New research reveals that oleic acid, abundant in olive oil, protects aging mice from gum infection-induced bone loss and gut microbiome disruption, highlighting how what we eat may help prevent age-related disease.

Study: Mediterranean diet component oleic acid decreases systemic impact of periodontal Porphyromonas gingivalis-infection in age: addressing role of stress resistance and microbiome. Image Credit: Me dia / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal npj Aging, researchers investigated whether dietary intervention alleviates the age-related systemic impact of oral infection with Porphyromonas gingivalis in a mouse model.

Periodontitis is an age-related disease characterized by a hyperinflammatory immune response, systemic inflammation, and shifts in the pathological oral microbiome. Severe periodontal diseases (PDs) affect about 19% of adults worldwide, i.e., over one billion people. PD is a disease of the tissues around the teeth, where plaque and bacterial pathogens accumulate, leading to a heightened inflammatory response and impaired resolution of inflammation.

Comorbidities, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis, can compromise tissue homeostasis at the infection site and lead to increased systemic bone loss. Oleic acid (OA) is a monounsaturated fatty acid, the main component of olive oil and the Mediterranean diet. Serum levels of OA negatively correlate with periodontal tissue loss. In contrast, serum levels of saturated fats, especially palmitic acid (PA), a component of the Western diet, positively correlate with PD.

One study reported that an OA-enriched diet (OA-ED) in mice with periodontal infection improved femoral bone microarchitecture and reduced systemic inflammation and alveolar bone loss compared to mice on a PA-enriched diet (PA-ED). Further, a diet rich in saturated fats is associated with PD progression in older individuals. However, whether aged individuals could benefit from specific nutritional components is unknown.

In the present study, researchers investigated whether nutritional interventions with OA could modulate responses to periodontal infection and protect against systemic effects associated with aging. First, young (five-week-old) and old mice (at least 73 weeks old) were fed a PA-ED, OA-ED, or normal diet (ND) for 16 weeks. Following five weeks of oral P. gingivalis inoculation, alveolar bone crest height was unchanged in young mice.

In contrast, the distance between the alveolar bone crest and the cemento-enamel junction increased by 63% in infected, old mice fed PA-ED compared to their aged OA-ED counterparts. Infection increased bone loss around the periodontal ligament (PDL) in old and young mice on PA-ED compared to those on OA-ED or ND. Furthermore, bone loss in PDL was accompanied by increased osteoclasts in aged, infected mice on PA-ED relative to their aged, OA-ED counterparts.

Next, microbial composition was analyzed in fecal samples one week and eight weeks after diet initiation. After one week, a distinct microbial pattern was observed in PA-ED-fed mice, characterized by increased Lachnospiraceae subtypes and reduced relative abundances of Muribaculaceae and Akkermansia. In contrast, the microbial composition was comparable between old and young mice on ND and OA-ED during the first eight weeks.

Further, mice were treated with an oral antibiotic (enrofloxacin) to evaluate whether dietary intake could modulate microbiome resilience in both age groups. The microbiome of old and young PA-ED-fed animals showed marked changes in taxonomic composition with antibiotic treatment. On the other hand, OA-ED-fed mice, especially young animals, had minor changes in taxonomic composition after antibiotic exposure.

Notably, while the microbiome of animals on ND or OA-ED returned to their pre-antibiosis state during the six-week follow-up, PA-ED-fed mice failed to recover their microbiome from antibiotic-induced shifts. The article notes that P. gingivalis itself was not detected in the gut, indicating that the observed microbiome effects were indirect. Further, the team performed a systemic serum analysis of stress resilience phospholipid indicators to investigate whether OA-ED supports stress response and resilience associated with age and P. gingivalis infection.

PA-ED mice differed in their serum phosphatidylinositol (PI) composition compared to ND and OA-ED mice. Uninfected ND and OA-ED animals showed age-related differences in PI proportions. Conversely, the PI proportion in uninfected PA-ED animals was comparable between old and young animals. However, P. gingivalis infection of old PA-ED-fed mice induced the most pronounced changes in lipidomic composition.

In contrast, infection of old OA-ED or ND mice did not induce marked changes in PI composition relative to their younger counterparts. PA-ED resulted in lower serum levels of the stress-reducing lipokine, PI(18:1/18:1), in both age groups compared to ND or OA-ED. PI(18:1/18:1) is linked to stress resistance, autophagy, and ERK1/2 modulation; however, the precise mechanisms underlying these associations remain under investigation. Moreover, P. gingivalis infection further reduced PI(18:1/18:1) levels in old and young PA-ED-fed mice and young ND-fed mice. By contrast, OA-ED stabilized PI(18:1/18:1) levels in infected young and old mice.

Additional experiments indicated that PA-ED increased osteoclast differentiation and primed bone marrow cells to inflammation, while OA-ED alleviated these effects. Furthermore, osteoblasts showed baseline inflammation and reduced responsiveness to infection in aged mice, promoting a pro-inflammatory microenvironment. PA-ED also increased femoral bone loss in response to infection in old mice.

The study design used only male mice to control for hormonal influences on bone metabolism; this limitation is important for interpreting and translating the results to both sexes. The authors also note that, while the study reveals strong mechanistic associations, further research is required to confirm these findings in humans.

The findings reveal that PA-ED aggravated P. gingivalis-related oral bone loss, especially in aged mice. Systemically, PA-ED destabilized the gut microbiota, elevating susceptibility to disturbances and infection-driven microbial shifts. PA-ED also decreased stress resistance and promoted cellular priming, enhancing osteoclast differentiation in infected mice of both age groups.

Osteoblasts showed baseline age-associated inflammation and reduced responses to infectious stimuli, promoting a pro-inflammatory microenvironment. This was accompanied by increased infection-induced femoral bone loss in old mice on PA-ED. Overall, the results suggest OA-ED is protective by limiting PD-associated systemic and local tissue damage with age. These results are based on preclinical animal models, and their applicability to human disease requires further investigation.

With the 4-0 victory over the Republic of Ireland on June 29, the U.S. Women's National Team made history. Not only did the team win to remain undefeated against Ireland and record its fourth straight shutout – the USWNT also earned a momentous 600th victory in program history.

While hundreds of USWNT players contributedto the lead-up to No. 600, this victory Sunday was accomplished with a lineup of 10 players with 10 caps or fewer heading into the match. Lynn Biyendolo, the starter with the most appearances, earned her 82nd cap and scored the opening goal. The average starting cap without Biyendolo was 4.1.

In 2018, the Women's National Team recorded its 500th win. It took 124 games to hit the next hundred milestone with a 100W-7L-17D record. That includes the 2019 FIFA World Cup run to its fourth championship and a gold medal in the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Overall, the team has 600 wins, 74 losses, and 91 ties. In an incredible feat, the Americans hold the highest winning percentage of any international sports team with 84 percent. On home soil, the Americans are 354W-24L-37D with a 90 percent win rate.

In total, the program has tallied 41 wins in World Cups, which includes four World Cup Championships (1991, 1999, 2015 and 2019). It also captured five Olympic gold medals (1996, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2024) with a totalof 33 wins at the Summer Games.

As the USWNT celebrates 40 years, legends like Mia Hamm, Abby Wambach, Kristine Lilly, Christie Rampone, Julie Foudy, Carli Lloyd, Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan, Becky Sauerbrunn and many, many more helped the Women's National Team reach this marker.

In the last 100, Lindsey Heaps (83), Emily Sonnett (70), Crystal Dunn (67) and Rose Lavelle (57) are active players who significantly contributed to the latest win record. Lavelle played in both the 500th and 600th winning matches.

And now, it continues with this next generation of players on the march to 700.

Rising U.S. women's national team talent Lily Yohannes is reportedly set for a move to France's top flight. 

Yohannes is closing in on a move to European powerhouse Lyon, ESPN and The Athletic reported Tuesday. The 18-year-old is currently under contract with Dutch club Ajax until July 2026. 

Ajax is set to receive roughly €450,000 for Yohannes and a sell-on percentage should Lyon transfer the midfielder in the future. Lyon had previously expressed interest in Yohannes back in mid-June and has continued that interest this month.

A former dual-national, Yohannes committed to the USWNT over the Netherlands. She debuted for the United States in June 2024, scoring on her debut and earning a combined eight caps since. 

At club level, Yohannes debuted for Ajax's first team in 2023 and since has scored 11 goals in 50 first-team appearances. She became the youngest player to ever start a UEFA Women's Champions League match when Ajax faced Paris Saint-Germain in UCL play. 

Yohannes would connect with fellow USWNT teammate Lindsey Heaps at Lyon. Lyon won the Premiere Ligue title in 2024-25 while also reaching the Women's Champions League semifinals before falling to eventual winners, Arsenal.

Women's Soccer

USWNT midfielder Lily Yohannes is set to complete her transfer to OL Lyonnes from Ajax.

Yohannes is expected to finalise personal terms with the French champions in the coming days.

The Athletic reported on June 12 OL Lyonnes had expressed serious interest in signing Yohannes and were in talks over a deal with Ajax, who the 18-year-old joined in 2023 and where she has a contract until 2026.

Yohannes made history in November 2023 when she became the youngest player to start a Champions League group stage game during Ajax's victory over Paris Saint-Germain.

The midfielder was born in Springfield, Virginia and has lived in Amsterdam with her family since she was 10 years old, playing her entire professional career in the Netherlands. She had the option of representing the Dutch women's national team, but last year announced her decision to commit to the U.S. at international level.

Yohannes made her USWNT debut against South Korea in June 2024 and scored 10 minutes after coming on. Aged 16 years and 358 days old, she became the third youngest scorer in USWNT history, behind only Kristine Lilly and Tiffany Roberts.

“The next two years of development will be important for her,” U.S. head coach Emma Hayes said of Yohannes this year. “I think it's been an unbelievable development pathway for her to be at Ajax.” Hayes added Ajax's style of play had “advanced her positional play in a way that I think makes her stand out beyond her years.”

OL Lyonnes are one of the most successful sides in the women's game and have won the Champions League a record eight times, most recently in 2023.

They recently underwent a rebrand in name and crest under owner Michele Kang, who acquired the club in 2024.

Jonathan Giraldez has been named as the club's new head coach ahead of the 2025-26 season following Joe Montemurro's move to the Australia women's national team.

OL Lyonnes have already completed the statement signing of France striker Marie-Antoinette Katoto from Paris Saint-Germain this summer.

Additional reporting from Jacob Whitehead

Analysis by Tamerra Griffin

The signing of Yohannes will give even more shape to the OL Lyonnes project under owner Michele Kang.

Alongside appointing Jonathan Giraldez head coach, OL Lyonnes have made splashy player signings, including Norwegian centre-back Ingrid Engen from Barcelona, German winger Jule Brand from Wolfsburg and French striker Marie Antoinette Katoto, who joins from league rivals Paris Saint-Germain. All three will be competing in the women's European Championship this summer.

From a U.S. perspective, Yohannes would be playing alongside international team-mate and captain Lindsey Heaps. Both players, along with most other Europe-based club players in the USWNT setup, have been granted a summer break by head coach Emma Hayes.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

A drone controlled by an unidentified party flew over the U.S. men's national team training session on Tuesday in St. Louis, where the group is preparing for Wednesday's Concacaf Gold Cup semifinal against Guatemala.

Members of U.S. Soccer's staff are in the process of identifying the drone, according to ESPN. The USMNT had three drones of their own to record their training session but the fourth drone came as a surprise, later landing outside the fenced perimeter and near a broadcast compound at the training site.

It was not the only disruption during the USMNT's training session on Tuesday, with a group of people reportedly being caught filming the team before being asked to stop. It is currently unclear if the two incidents are related.

The USMNT will face Guatemala at St. Louis' Energizer Park in the Gold Cup semifinals on Wednesday, targeting their first appearance in the final since winning the competition in 2021. Guatemala, meanwhile, will play their first Gold Cup semifinal since 1996 and hope to reach the final for the first time in the team's history.

While teams are more likely than they once were to use drones to record their own training sessions, there have been stories of teams from North America using drones to spy on their opponents.

The most notable among them is the Canada drone scandal that rocked the 2024 Olympics, which later led FIFA to dock the women's national team six points and resulted in then-head coach Bev Priestman being fired from her post. The team had used drones to watch opponents' training sessions for years, per reports, in a practice introduced by John Herdman, formerly the head coach of both Canada's women's and men's national teams from 2011 to 2018. According to TSN, Herdman was heard discussing the practice as early as 2016 at the Concacaf U-17 Women's Championship.

Herdman received a written admonishment in May following a disciplinary hearing in front of an independent commission.

The U.S. men's national team is one win away from making the Concacaf Gold Cup final. Mauricio Pochettino's side avoided heartbreak dispatching Costa Rica in a quarterfinal penalty shootout, but at the same time built belief that a trophy this summer is possible.

Their run might not be paved with the revenge they sought coming in given Canada was upset by Guatemala. But, the team should look at the semifinals as a big opportunity. Mexico still likely awaits in the final if they both get there, but the USMNT will be heavily favored against their semifinal opponent. 

Matt Freese continues to make a name for himself this summer assuming starting goalkeeper responsibilities. He made crucial saves in the shootout and should keep starting Gold Cup games. Perhaps a changing of the guard given we haven't seen Matt Turner this summer.

Here's how the USMNT could line up against Guatemala in the Gold Cup semifinals.

GK: Matt Freese—The New York City FC goalkeeper came up big in the penalty shootout and is poised to start however many games the USMNT play in this tournament.

RB: Alex Freeman—Freeman continues to make a case for himself next summer as Pochettino's starting right back this summer.

CB: Chris Richards—Richards has vocally made a point to be one of the leaders of this squad.

CB: Tim Ream—Ream should continue starting this summer, but fans want to see more assurance at the back and cleaner moments of playing out of the back.

LB: Max Arfsten—Arfsten could've let his head drop after conceding a penalty in the first half. The Columbus Crew player rebounded by assisting an equalizer and scoring his first 

DM: Sebastian Berhalter—Berhalter missed his penalty in the shootout, and his father's reaction in the crowd went viral. But, Pochettino should keep him in here and give him another game.

DM: Tyler Adams—The veteran leader of the group. Adams patrols midfield looking to book USMNT's spot in the final.

RM: Jack McGlynn—McGlynn came off the bench against Costa Rica, but he should get a start in the next round. 

AM: Malik Tillman—Tillman took a beating against Costa Rica in what was a very physical game. But, he's the best option in the 10 and needs to start.

LM: Diego Luna—Luna scored the equalizer against Costa Rica as he continues to build his brand as a fan-favorite.

ST: Brian White—If there's going to be a change in the lineup, Pochettino could insert the Vancouver Whitecaps striker up top. Patrick Agyemang certainly causes problems up front, but Pochettino could want a different look against Guatemala.

Michael Emons

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Thibaut Courtois has to come over of his area and head the ball clear after he and team-mate Antonio Rudiger had got in each other's way with an attempted first clearance.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Federico Valverde almost scored at the end of the first half and has almost scored at the start of the second half. Jude Bellingham, under pressure and closely marked, gives it to the Real captain, who shoots across goal but just wide of the far post.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

And the second half is under way. Remember, extra-time and penalties are both still possible.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

It's raining at the start of the second half, but no lightning anywhere near the stadium so far so we're ready to go.

The rain might be quite welcome in the sweltering conditions in Miami. It has just gone 4pm local time.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

The winner of this tie will take on either Borussia Dortmund or Monterrey of Mexico in the quarter-final on 5 July.

Dortmund and Monterrey start their last-16 tie at 02:00 BST on Wednesday.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Expect Michele di Gregorio's wonderful one-handed save to deny Federico Valverde on a loop and to see it again and again during the half-time break.

That has been the best moment of the match by some way, although Jude Bellingham also came close, only to see a shot cleared off the line by Daniele Rugani.

Apart from that, not much to get excited about in the Miami heat.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

The ball is headed back by Juventus and it nearly fell for Real captain Federico Valverde, although he couldn't capitalise as he missed the attempted header.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Real are ending the half strongly. Trent Alexander-Arnold fizzes a low cross from the right and it causes panic among the Juventus defence, but no Real player can get a touch.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Michael BrownFormer Premier League midfielder on Dazn

It's a really good, strong left hand and a decent save. Decent strike initially too from Valverde.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Arda Guler shows a great piece of skill to take a pass on the chest and then lift the ball over Francisco Conceicao although his cross is then cut out.

Then, as we move into injury time, Real's Federico Valverde creates the best moment of the match with a fine strike from 30 yards. Michele di Gregorio does superbly to fling himself to his left and at full stretch get a hand to the ball to push it around the post.

Probably the best two bits of action in the space of a few minutes.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Bright from Juventus' Khephren Thuram as he shows a fine burst of pace to gets some space down the left, only for his cross to be headed away at the near post by Aurelien Tchouameni.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Michael BrownFormer Premier League midfielder on Dazn

That was a quality ball in. He'll be disappointed to have got nothing on that because he's got a long time to look at it. Another opportunity wasted. 

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Arda Guler looks to provide some inspiration with a whipped in cross, but Real's Aurelien Tchouameni misjudges the header and can't get a touch on the delivery to send it goalwards.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

It has not been a great half of football, summed up with Juventus overhitting a cross from the left. We've already seen three of the six last-16 ties go to extra-time and that's what we'll have if it's level at 90 minutes.

We're yet to have a penalty shootout yet in this tournament? Is today the day?

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

As we have got used to in this tournament, there is a cooling break at the 30-minute mark as the players desperately get a drink of water in the stifling conditions.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

We haven't mentioned Jude Bellingham much, until now. The England man is in the six-yard box and has a strike which is partially saved by a foot of Michele di Gregorio with team-mate Daniele Rugani doing the rest and clearing it off the line. 

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Michael BrownFormer Premier League midfielder on Dazn

Yildiz has just said ""whenever you give me the ball, I'm going to try and do something"".

The way he shifts it both ways is impressive. 

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Real quickly earn a second corner and this time it goes short to Vinicius Jr, but, unmarked from 25 yards out, all he can do is drag it harmlessly off target.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Aurelien Tchouameni has a strike from 25 yards for Real, but it is deflected wide for Real's first corner.

The outswinger eventually finds Dean Huijsen and the ex-Bournemouth man puts too much on the cross back into the danger zone.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

A chance for Juventus as the ball is played in from the left to Francisco Conceicao, but the header lacks the power or direction to trouble Thibaut Courtois, who make a routine stop.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic didn't hold back after Inter Miami's Round of 16 blowout loss to Paris Saint-Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup over the weekend, likening players on the Miami squad to “statues” and pushing back on any criticism of Lionel Messi.

Inter Miami's presence in the knockout stage was already a bit of a surprise – the result of a surprising win over Porto in the group stage – which made the 4-0 loss to the reigning Champions League winners not much of a shock. 

Ibrahimovic, a Swedish international who played for some of the top clubs in the world, including time at AC Milan, PSG and Manchester United, took issue with any sort of blame being placed on Messi for the ugly loss in the 32-team tournament. 

He currently holds a senior advisor position with AC Milan. 

“Messi's defeat? No, don't talk about the defeat as if it was his fault! Messi didn't lose, Inter Miami did! Have you seen this team?” he told French soccer publication Footmercato.

“Messi plays among statues, not teammates! If he was in a real team, in Paris, in Manchester [City], in any big team, you would have seen the real lion.

“Messi only plays because he loves the game, because he can still do what 99 percent of players can't! But he's surrounded by those who run as if they were carrying bags of cement! There are no coaches, no stars, not even players who understand how to move without the ball!”

Inter Miami possesses one of the more star-studded rosters in Major League Soccer with Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba, and Luis Suarez.

“You want to blame Messi? If he plays with [Cristiano] Ronaldo, with [Kylian] Mbappe, with [Erling] Haaland, with Zlatan. Then you can talk! But today? No, no, no,” Ibrahimovic continued. 

“That's not the Messi I know, he's a big ghost who plays in a circus! But be careful, if you give him a real team, he'll burn the stadium down again! Because quite simply. Messi is still Messi, but today? It's not his defeat, it's the defeat of Inter Miami and football.”

PSG dominated Inter Miami – the only MLS club of the three that made it to the Club World Cup that advanced – and Messi's impact on the match was limited. 

Inter Miami took home $21.05 million in prize money as a result of their run in the Club World Cup.

World Cup will transform sport","https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2025/07/01/world-cup-new-jersey-gov-phil-murphy-future-impact/84433956007/","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 19:28:15 GMT","

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy believes the FIFA Club World Cup will be remembered as a “huge success” and will only set the stage for a memorable World Cup in 2026.

MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, has hosted five Club World Cup group-stage matches, which averaged about 35,000-40,000 fans with “incredible energy,” Murphy said.

The venue will host a quarterfinal on July 5, semifinal matches on July 8 and 9, and the Club World Cup final on July 13.

Next year's FIFA World Cup final will also be played at MetLife Stadium on July 19, 2026 – which Murphy believes will be epic.

“It will be the most watched event in human history,” Murphy told USA TODAY Sports in an interview on July 1.

Murphy is a big soccer fan. He played as a child – “not well,” he adds. He was on the board of the U.S. Soccer Federation, and he's a founding owner of Gotham FC in the National Women's Soccer League. He played a crucial role in helping the New York/New Jersey effort in landing Club World Cup and World Cup matches at MetLife Stadium.

“We're huge soccer fans and we love the sport – the beautiful game – and we're thrilled to be playing a meaningful role both this year and next year,” Murphy said.

Murphy credited FIFA president Gianni Infantino, MetLife Stadium operators, and the owners of the Jets (Woody Johnson) and Giants (The Mara and Tisch families) for being “extraordinary supporters” during the Club World Cup.

He was tuned into the June 30 match in Orlando, which saw Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal eliminate English Premier League standouts Manchester City 4-3 in the Round of 16, noting “the level of soccer and the passion.”

“Anytime you do something for the first time, you're on a learning curve. But I think it's been a terrific idea,” Murphy said of the first Club World Cup to feature 32 teams and hosted in the U.S. this summer. “I think this is going to be looked at as a huge success.”

Murphy has attended the five Club World Cup matches already played at MetLife Stadium and praised the fans from the six different clubs that have played in the venue.

The noise made by Brazilian clubs Palmeiras and Fluminense, Egyptian side Al Ahly, Portuguese club Porto, German standouts Borussia Dortmund and South Korean club Ulsan HD FC even eclipsed the noise made by fans attending NFL games featuring the New York Giants and Jets, Murphy said.

“We regularly attend Giants or Jets football games there with 70,000 to 80,000, and the decibel levels from about half that amount (of people) were about 10 times (more). And I'm literally not kidding – 10 times, what they are at a normal game there,” Murphy said with a laugh. “They were great matches with lots of great spirit.”

“Just incredible passion,” he added. “And when they're traveling into the region, there's a big economic boom to the region, and most notably, to New Jersey. It's part of the driving reason we wanted to host as many matches as we are. This is a really good few weeks for Jersey and for the region.”

Murphy says he measures successful events at MetLife Stadium in three dimensions: Was it safe? Was your transportation to and from a good experience? And how was the fan experience inside the stadium?

“All three metrics feel really good,” Murphy said.

“The boxes that we care most about, we've been able to check across the board. And I'm confident we'll continue to do so for the balance of this tournament, and obviously, most importantly, for the World Cup next year.”

MetLife Stadium will host eight World Cup matches next summer: five in the Group Stage, one in the Round of 32, one in the Round of 16, and the Final.

Along with his excitement for next year's event, Murphy believes the Club World Cup and World Cup will play crucial roles for the future of soccer fandom in the United States.

Murphy believes both tournaments will leave their own legacies behind, similar to how the 1994 World Cup birthed Major League Soccer's inception in 1996 and increased awareness of the sport over the last 30 years.

“You're going to see a similar quantum leap in the popularity and participation of soccer in America, and certainly in our region,” Murphy said. “This will take us to another level heretofore not seen. It's what comes, what it leads to, that I think, is as if not more important than the actual event itself.”","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

World Cup

FIFA president Gianni Infantino has received a letter signed by over 90 civil society groups, the majority of which are based in the United States, expressing “deep concern” about immigration policies and enforcement measures in the U.S. and their potential impact on the World Cup in 2026.

The letter urges FIFA to use its “influence” to call on the administration of President Donald Trump to guarantee the fundamental rights of the millions of football fans who will seek to attend the World Cup next summer. The groups reference Infantino's “high-profile engagements” in the White House and his recent trip to Saudi Arabia and Qatar, when he accompanied President Trump at an investment summit as evidence of his proximity to the U.S. President.

The letter asks FIFA to leverage its position to “publicly” urge President Trump to reverse policies and practices that the groups say pose risks to both foreign tournament attendees and migrant communities living within the U.S. The letter goes on to warn that if FIFA continues to remain silent, then “the FIFA brand will be used as a public relations tool to whitewash the reputation of an increasingly authoritarian government.”

The letter says: “We call on FIFA to use its influence to encourage the U.S. government to guarantee the fundamental rights of the millions of foreign visitors and fans who seek entry to the U.S. to attend the tournaments, and those of the constitutional rights of the many immigrants who already live, work, and contribute meaningfully to the cities selected to host them.”

The letter, which has been seen by The Athletic, is co-signed by groups including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and NAACP, an American civil rights organization founded in 1909, as well as the 105-year-old American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Civil society groups and unions based in New York, Florida, Georgia, California, Texas, Massachusetts, Missouri, Pennsylvania, all states which will host World Cup fixtures, have signed the letter.

The letter was co-ordinated by the British advocacy group Fair Square, in collaboration with several of the signatories. It was sent to FIFA on the morning of July 1, addressed to Infantino and copying in senior officials including Carlos Cordeiro, the former U.S. Soccer president who now serves as an advisor to Infantino. The letter was also copied into the FIFA COO Kevin Lamour, its World Cup COO Heimo Schirgi, as well as its  director of government relations Alex Sopko and chief strategy officer Amy Hopfinger. The letter also copied in Matthew Mullen, the FIFA Head of Human Rights specifically for the World Cup, in 2026, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

Minky Worden, the director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, told The Athletic this type of intervention is “very uncommon in the context of any U.S. mega-sporting event”, which underlines the concern felt by the signatories about the current climate in the U.S.

The letter points to the series of executive orders and policy changes implemented by President Trump since his inauguration in 2025. The administration argues these orders are in the interests of national security and public safety.

In their letter, however, the rights groups say they are concerned for the projected 2.6 million visitors projected to attend the World Cup in 2026.

The letter says: “Increased immigration enforcement actions, abusive Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, and broader border restrictions have also contributed to widespread fear and uncertainty. Several foreign governments have already issued travel advisories to its citizens, warning of risks of being denied entry or detained and deported when traveling to the U.S.”

There has been evidence of reduced inbound travel to the U.S., with Republican congressman Darin LaHood last week expressing concern about a 40 per cent reduction in travel to the U.S. from Canada amid a trade war, while he added that tourism in Las Vegas, New York and Florida is down.

The letter points to the imposition of travel bans by the Trump administration against nationals from twelve countries, which threatens to exclude Iranian football fans from the World Cup, as their team has already qualified for the tournament, as well as partial restrictions on seven more nations including Venezuela, who are in contention to qualify. The groups also reference reporting from the New York Times, which claimed that 36 more countries, many of which are African, could be added to the list.

The letter warns that “spectators from other countries remain subject to invasive and burdensome vetting procedures and the possibility of being denied travel authorization or entry due to their political or religious views.”

The groups also point to concerns about the alleged “cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment” within U.S. immigration detention facilities.

The letter says that the success of a World Cup depends not only on infrastructure and logistics, but also the “spirit of openness and safety extended to all who participate and attend”.

Infantino insisted at the FIFA Congress in May that the world is welcome in America, saying in Paraguay: “Of course, the players, of course, everyone involved, all of us, but definitely also all the fans.”

The U.S. vice-president J.D. Vance said in May: “Of course everyone is welcome to come and see this wonderful event. We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the games.

“But when the time is up we want them to go home, otherwise they will have to talk to Secretary Noem,” he continued, referring to Kristi Noem, the Secretary of Homeland Security.

The letter argues that FIFA, in accordance with its own Human Rights Policy, has a “responsibility to act.”

The letter says: “The policy specifically identifies that ‘providing for the safety and security of people who are attending or are otherwise involved in or affected by FIFA's events may impact certain fundamental human rights, such as freedom of movement, expression and assembly' as one of FIFA's five salient human rights risks.”

It continues: “People of all nationalities should be able to travel to the United States without fear of arbitrary denial of entry, arbitrary detention, or deportation without due process, and people in the United States should be able to exercise their right to freedom of expression without fear of arbitrary detention and deportation, and migrant communities should not live in perpetual fear of CBP and ICE raids.”

The CBP provoked alarm before this summer's FIFA Club World Cup when it posted on Facebook that its agents would be “suited and booted ready to provide security for the first round of games.”

The Athletic revealed that the post was removed after direct contact from senior personnel at FIFA expressing concerns, but it is not clear as to the extent to which FIFA's outreach impacted the decision.

NBC Miami reported that ICE confirmed that they would be present at games as part of the security operation, while also including a reminder that non-American citizens should carry proof of their legal status. Attendances for the Club World Cup have been mixed, with some matches close to full and some leaving tens of thousands of seats empty.

FIFA, which has been approached for comment about the letter to Infantino, has faced numerous questions over its commitment to human rights after holding its previous two men's World Cups in Qatar and Russia, while the 2034 edition will be held in Saudi Arabia. Eleven leading human rights organisations have previously criticised a 39-page document published by the world football governing body FIFA by the Saudi arm of the global law firm Clifford Chance. The groups claimed it represented a “flawed” assessment of Saudi Arabia as the country bid to host the World Cup.

FIFA is currently hiring for a Head of Human Rights & Anti-Discrimination, according to a job posting on its webpage. The posting says the applicant must have 10 years experience as a human rights executive, must demonstrate high ethical standards and personal integrity, and have experience working with marginalized and vulnerable people. Among the key tasks will be to ensure the active and transparent communication of FIFA's human rights work.

Winners will face either Borussia Dortmund or Monterrey

Michael Emons

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Thibaut Courtois has to come out of his area and head the ball clear after he and team-mate Antonio Rudiger had got in each other's way with an attempted first clearance.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Federico Valverde almost scored at the end of the first half and has almost scored at the start of the second half. Jude Bellingham, under pressure and closely marked, gives it to the Real captain, who shoots across goal but just wide of the far post.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

And the second half is under way. Remember, extra-time and penalties are both still possible.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

It's raining at the start of the second half, but no lightning anywhere near the stadium so far so we're ready to go.

The rain might be quite welcome in the sweltering conditions in Miami. It has just gone 4pm local time.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

The winner of this tie will take on either Borussia Dortmund or Monterrey of Mexico in the quarter-final on 5 July.

Dortmund and Monterrey start their last-16 tie at 02:00 BST on Wednesday.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Expect Michele di Gregorio's wonderful one-handed save to deny Federico Valverde on a loop and to see it again and again during the half-time break.

That has been the best moment of the match by some way, although Jude Bellingham also came close, only to see a shot cleared off the line by Daniele Rugani.

Apart from that, not much to get excited about in the Miami heat.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

The ball is headed back by Juventus and it nearly fell for Real captain Federico Valverde, although he couldn't capitalise as he missed the attempted header.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Real are ending the half strongly. Trent Alexander-Arnold fizzes a low cross from the right and it causes panic among the Juventus defence, but no Real player can get a touch.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Michael BrownFormer Premier League midfielder on Dazn

It's a really good, strong left hand and a decent save. Decent strike initially too from Valverde.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Arda Guler shows a great piece of skill to take a pass on the chest and then lift the ball over Francisco Conceicao although his cross is then cut out.

Then, as we move into injury time, Real's Federico Valverde creates the best moment of the match with a fine strike from 30 yards. Michele di Gregorio does superbly to fling himself to his left and at full stretch get a hand to the ball to push it around the post.

Probably the best two bits of action in the space of a few minutes.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Bright from Juventus' Khephren Thuram as he shows a fine burst of pace to gets some space down the left, only for his cross to be headed away at the near post by Aurelien Tchouameni.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Michael BrownFormer Premier League midfielder on Dazn

That was a quality ball in. He'll be disappointed to have got nothing on that because he's got a long time to look at it. Another opportunity wasted. 

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Arda Guler looks to provide some inspiration with a whipped in cross, but Real's Aurelien Tchouameni misjudges the header and can't get a touch on the delivery to send it goalwards.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

It has not been a great half of football, summed up with Juventus overhitting a cross from the left. We've already seen three of the six last-16 ties go to extra-time and that's what we'll have if it's level at 90 minutes.

We're yet to have a penalty shootout yet in this tournament? Is today the day?

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

As we have got used to in this tournament, there is a cooling break at the 30-minute mark as the players desperately get a drink of water in the stifling conditions.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

We haven't mentioned Jude Bellingham much, until now. The England man is in the six-yard box and has a strike which is partially saved by a foot of Michele di Gregorio with team-mate Daniele Rugani doing the rest and clearing it off the line. 

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Michael BrownFormer Premier League midfielder on Dazn

Yildiz has just said ""whenever you give me the ball, I'm going to try and do something"".

The way he shifts it both ways is impressive. 

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Real quickly earn a second corner and this time it goes short to Vinicius Jr, but, unmarked from 25 yards out, all he can do is drag it harmlessly off target.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

Aurelien Tchouameni has a strike from 25 yards for Real, but it is deflected wide for Real's first corner.

The outswinger eventually finds Dean Huijsen and the ex-Bournemouth man puts too much on the cross back into the danger zone.

Real Madrid 0-0 Juventus

A chance for Juventus as the ball is played in from the left to Francisco Conceicao, but the header lacks the power or direction to trouble Thibaut Courtois, who make a routine stop.

Al Hilal defeated Manchester City in the FIFA Club World Cup round of 16 in one of the biggest upsets of the tournament. An upset that followed another major upset earlier in the day as Fluminense eliminated Inter Milan.

Man City dominated the first half after Bernardo Silva opened the scoring. They limited Al Hilal to half-chances for the first 45, but the second half was a completely different tale. Marcos Leonardo and Malcom each scored while Erling Haaland kept the Cityzens in the tie to force extra time. Three more goals in extra time with both sides trading blows produced one of the best ties of the summer. 

Leonardo's 112th minute goal was the decider in the end as Simone Inzaghi's side pulled off the upset. Redemption for Inzaghi in some way after losing the Champions League final back in 2023 against Guardiola, but belief is building within the Al Hilal camp that they can make a real run this tournament. Fluminense await in the next round, but they'll celebrate this win before preparing for the quarterfinals.

One of the best games of the Club World Cup is in the books, but the excitement continues to build as we near the decisive stages of the tournament.

Takeaways from the game below.

The entire story tells a much different tale, but the first half was extremely dominant from Man City. It was a vintage showing from a Pep Guardiola side as they methodically maintained possession and bided their time every time they were on the ball. Play was shifted wide, back-and-forth as Savinho and Jeremy Doku looked to find a killer pass. They were cruising... until the second half.

If the Manchester City that showed up in the first half kept on, their status as favorites would've been cemented. Instead, the second half and extra time told a different tale. The Man City we saw for a majority of the night that what fans saw last year in the Premier League and Champions League. They were unable to dominate for the majority of the night and it cost them.

Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Ait-Nouri look to be some of the best signings of the summer, not to mention Rayan Cherki's contribution off the bench.

Phil Foden wasn't himself last season. A goal-scoring drought, in and out of starting lineups, he never quite looked like his best. This summer? He was a contender for player of the tournament if they advanced.

Foden's goal at the end of the first half of extra time was clutch and a showcase of his technical ability. On talk of Man City's summer business, Foden's reemergence could end up being the biggest story of the summer. Particularly in the wake of Kevin De Bruyne's departure. Whether Guardiola decides to insert him specifically into the No. 10 role, or play him on the flanks where he can be lethal, Foden could play a major part in Man City's return to the title picture. 

What an opportunity for Al Hilal and Simone Inzaghi in just his first month in charge. Al Hilal certainly weren't favored coming into the game, but fans counting them out didn't see value their performance against Real Madrid in the group stage.

After dispatching one of the tournament favorites, Al Hilal face off against Cinderella story Fluminense. While neutrals might've fantasized about an opportunity to see Inzaghi face off against his former club, he can put those nerves to bed thanks to El Flu.

They have the belief in them now after defeating Man City. Al Hilal vs. Fluminense will be one of the most exciting games of the tournament as two underdog sides look to book their spot in the final four.

Inter Milan and Manchester City were surprisingly knocked out of the FIFA Club World Cup last 16 round. The Nerazzurri were beaten 2-0 by Fluminense, while Man City were stunned 4-3 by Al Hilal in extra time.

La Beneamata's search for a trophy ended in woe again following their elimination in the FIFA Club World Cup tournament. Christian Chivu's team crashed out in the last 16 after suffering a 2-0 defeat against Brazilian side Fluminense.

Keen on advancing into the next round, the Nerazzurri found themselves in trouble soon after kick-off as their opponent immediately went a goal up. Renato Gaucho's side went ahead after just three minutes of play through German Cano.

That early goal gives Fluminense a tactical advantage as they can absorb Inter's pressure and play more on the break. Despite the Italian side's flurry of attacking attempts, Fluzao managed to hold on tight before eventually securing their victory with a second goal, netted by Hercules deep in stoppage time.

In another tie, Manchester City were also experiencing a similar result as Inter during their CWC last 16 tie against Al Hilal. Pep Guardiola's side saw their journey in the tournament end earlier than expected, despite dominating the game and getting an early lead.

Man City went one goal up during the first 45 minutes through Bernardo Silva after just nine minutes of play. However, City's failure to convert their chances in that first half cost them dearly in the end.

Al Hilal bounced back in the second half as they turned things around with goals from Marcos Leonardo and Malcom. Man City managed to draw level with a goal from Erling Haaland, making the scoreline 2-2 in regular time.

Despite their enormous pressure during the 2×15 period, Man City continue to struggle defensively against Al Hilal's counterattack. Simone Inzaghi's men went on to shock everyone as they scored two more goals in extra time.

Kalidou Koulibaly and Leonardo's second gave Al Hilal that surprise result as City only managed to score one back from Phil Foden's effort. It was another disappointing outcome for Man City, who, just like Inter, failed to win any trophy this past season.

American men's players continue their search for an elusive Grand Slam title this month, hoping to be the one to end the drought.

Former ATP number one Andy Roddick represents the last American man to win a Grand Slam title, having triumphed at the US Open in 2003.

Pete Sampras meanwhile is the last American man to win Wimbledon, which is currently underway in London.

Sampras was successful at Wimbledon in 2000, when he won the grass court Grand Slam for the fourth successive year.

The nation's hopes of further success are now falling on a handful of players, namely Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton, Frances Tiafoe and Tommy Paul.

And speaking on Tennis Channel, former American professional John Isner has now shared which of his compatriots he is most excited about on the ATP Tour.

Isner commented: “I think the one who excites me the most is probably Ben Shelton. His game is so huge.

“He might take some early first round losses, which we saw in Queen's and Mallorca to Lerner Tien, but he picks up his level when the stage is big, so I expect him to play very well at Wimbledon.

“Once he can get his feet wet in the tournament he is a crazy tough out because he plays with such flair and confidence. He has such a big game, his serve is ridiculous. He is so athletic.

“I think Ben Shelton in my mind is the guy that has probably the best chance to break through in a huge event like Wimbledon in the next three to five years.”

Shelton has enjoyed superb progress on the ATP Tour this season, having recently broken the top 10 for the first time in his career.

But he remains behind Fritz in that regard, with the 2024 US Open runner-up currently fifth in the ATP rankings.

It is, however, European players who dominate the standings, with Italian Jannik Sinner at the very top of the pile.

He is followed by Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz and German Alexander Zverev in second and third respectively, with Briton Jack Draper in fourth.

And unfortunately for the American men, their European counterparts continue to dominate the sport as Wimbledon gets underway.

Moreover, their female counterparts are doing their lack of success no favours, with Americans Madison Keys and Coco Gauff winning the 2025 Australian Open and French Open respectively.

Fritz has come the closest to ending the painful men's drought in recent times, having lost last year's US Open final to Sinner.

And Shelton also produced a valiant effort at the 2025 Australian Open, but once again it was the world number one who ended his hopes, this time in the semi-finals.

Also excited about Shelton is Brad Gilbert, but Jimmy Connors favours Tommy Paul for Wimbledon success over him and Fritz.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Wimbledon got off to a cracking start on day one with several fantastic storylines developing. A number of big upsets took place and there was another one at the start of day two. Jessica Pegula, the third seed, was sensationally dumped out by Italian youngster Elisabetta Cocciaretto. There was another huge shock in the evening as Coco Gauff fell in straight sets at the hands of Dayana Yastremska.

There was no such misfortune for Jack Draper, who breezed into the second round after Sebastian Baez was forced to retire through injury. Dan Evans and Jack Pinnington Jones also secured victories on another brilliant day for the British contingent at SW19. As things stand, a total of 10 home players have made it through to round two.

Minutes after No. 2 seed Coco Gauff suffered a shock first-round exit on Court 1, the men's 18th seed Ugo Humbert has gone out of the tournament.

Veteran Frenchman Gael Monfils caused a huge upset over five sets. And you could hear the cheers all the way on Centre Court - even through the closed roof. Here's the updated list of seeds to go out on day two.

MEN'S

7th seed Lorenzo Musetti

30th seed Alex Michelsen

27th seed Denis Shapovalov

28th seed Alexander Bublik

3rd seed Alexander Zverev

18th seed Ugo Humbert

WOMEN'S

3rd seed Jessica Pegula

26th seed Marta Kostyuk

5th seed Qinwen Zheng

15th seed Karolina Muchova

25th seed Magdalena Frech

27th seed Magda Linette

2nd seed Coco Gauff

No messing about from Dayana Yastremska - she had Coco Gauff in trouble and she has capitalised in ruthless fashion to win 7-5 6-1.

Yastremska was buoyed by her win in the first-set tiebreak and only ramped up the pressure on Gauff in the second.

A huge scalp on a day which has seen three of the top-five seeds crash out of the women's draw.



The roof has just shut on Centre Court with Novak Djokovic and Alexandre Muller level at one-set all.

It's still about more than half-full on Wimbledon's biggest showcourt, even though the fans here have been watching more than seven hours' worth of tennis.

They let out a loud cheer when the floodlights were switched on, bathing the court in a warm glow.

Coco Gauff is well and truly on the rops on Court 1.

The second seed is one game away from crashing out of Wimbledon in startling circumstances.

Dayana Yastremska won the first set via a tiebreak and she is now 5-1 up in the second set.

It would take a miracle for Gauff to bring it back from here.

Incredible scenes on Centre Court as Alexandre Muller wins a lengthy tiebreak to claim the second set against Novak Djokovic!

The veteran Serb had six opportunites to wrap up the set but was made to pay for his mistakes.

It's level heading into set three.



Jack Pinnington Jones is through to the second round on his Wimbledon debut!

The 22-year-old has beaten Tomas Etcheverry in straight sets to wrap up a memorable evening at SW19.

It finishes 6-7 3-6 5-7 in favour of Pinnington Jones, who celebrates with a fist-pump before soaking up the applause of the crowd.

More joy for the Brits on day two!

Carlos Alcaraz has sent a heartwarming message to the poorly fan who needed treatment during his victory over Fabio Fognini.

The fan's daughter wrote on social media: ""Thank you for the concern shown to my mum today who was taken ill during your tennis match at Centre Court. Unlikely you'll see this message but I can try!

To her surprise, Alcaraz responded: ""You're very welcome, it was nothing!

""I hope your mum is doing well. Send her a kiss from me and take good care of her!""

You\u2019re very welcome, it was nothing! I hope your mum is doing well. Send her a kiss from me and take good care of her! \u2764\ufe0f

John McEnroe has named Jack Draper as one of four players he believes can go all the way at SW19.

Speaking on BBC One, the American said: ""Jack Draper is the fourth favourite to win this tournament.

""He could win a major for the first time in his life, this is about dealing with the nerves. That's pressure but it's also a pretty cool feeling.

""I wouldn't pick Draper as my No. 1 [favourite]. I would pick the obvious pick as No. 1 but it's difficult to win three in a row.

""In terms of the favourite, it's a toss-up between Alcaraz and Sinner. Jack might have to beat both of those guys and Novak [Djokovic] and that's the really hard part.""



Jack Draper is not putting any thought into his tough road to the later rounds of Wimbledon.

He faces Marin Cilic in the second round after thrashing Sebastian Baez, while he is projected to meet Jakub Mensik in the round of 16, Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals, Jannik Sinner in the semi-finals and Carlos Alcaraz in the final.

""I can't be thinking five matches ahead,"" Draper insisted. ""Everyone in this draw can play incredible tennis.

""You've got to have respect for every one of these guys. Until I deserve a place in the next round, I'm not there yet.""

Novak Djokovic has made a flying start to his opening match against Alexandre Muller.

The veteran Serb only dropped one game on his way to winning the first set.

Muller is up against it and will need to raise his level to get himself back into this contest.

Centre Court ticketholders were expecting to watch Coco Gauff take on Dayana Yastremska in her opening match after Novak Djokovic played tonight.

However, that match has been moved because of lengthy delays on the main show court.

Organisers likely did not expect Gauff and Yastremska to be able to finish tonight after Djokovic and Alexandre Muller stepped onto the court at 7pm, had they remained on Centre.

As a result, Gauff's match has been moved to Court 1, with the pair currently walking out in Gauff's bid claim the Channel Slam after her win in Paris.

Djokovic, meanwhile, has broken Muller for a third time to take the opening set.

Jack Draper showed his class with some kind words for Sebastian Baez in his on-court interview.

""I wanted to play a bit longer, in all honesty,"" said the young Brit.

""I was getting my tennis together a little bit and I was serving well. It's no way to win like that and I wish Sebastian the best in his recovery, of course.

""I just try and focus on the things I can control. Coming out here, giving my very best and hopefully playing the best tennis I can.""



Sebastian Baez has retired in the third set against Jack Draper after losing the first two.

The Argentine suffered a nasty fall earlier in the match and appeared to twist his knee, which required medical attention and a five-minute break in play.

After discussing the injury with two physios, Baez opted to continue playing but could not finish the contest and looked emotional as he left the court.

Draper, who was impressive throughout, next faces Marin Cilic in the second round.

With Alexander Zverev going out in a match that started on day one of the tournament and finished on day two, that's five seeded men and five seeded women who have lost so far on Tuesday.

Seeds out on day two:

MEN'S

7th seed Lorenzo Musetti

30th seed Alex Michelsen

27th seed Denis Shapovalov

28th seed Alexander Bublik

3rd seed Alexander Zverev

WOMEN'S

3rd seed Jessica Pegula

26th seed Marta Kostyuk

5th seed Qinwen Zheng

15th seed Karolina Muchova

25th seed Magdalena Frech

French star Arthur Rinderknech stunned No.3 seed Alexander Zverev in a gruelling, four-hour and 40-minute clash that spanned two days.

The match was suspended at one-set all shortly before the 11pm curfew hit on Monday. World No.72 Rinderknech returned and earned his biggest win ever 7-6(3) 6-7(8) 6-3 6-7(5) 6-4.

Afterwards, he told the Centre Court crowd: “I don't know, I don't even know where to start, start for sure with the crowd because I'm feeling the same way as you guys. I don't know, this woo every time! I'm dying every time you guys are saying woo!

“My legs are still shaking, I can't do it anymore, just so happy the match is finished. We started yesterday, at 8? We finish today at 7. Slept about six hours last night. It's very difficult this sport but, I mean, what a moment. Such emotions.”



Jack Draper made just as little fuss in winning that second set as he did the first one.

Sebastian Baez has been thoroughly outgunned on Court 1 in just about every department.

And we've only been playing for an hour and four minutes.

If the first two are anything to go by, this third set should just be a formality for Britain's number-one hope at this year's tournament.

Sebastian Baez has decided to play on after a five-minute delay and medical treatment to his right knee.

The Argentine, while down 2-1 in the second set, had lengthy conversations with the physios while receiving treatment.

After watching Jack Draper's opponent take a nasty fall, John McEnroe on BBC commentary said: ""That didn't feel too good on the let knee. Potentially he could hurt himself further here in a match that he's got about a two per cent to me chance to winning, maybe five at the most.

""Maybe not go through safe so he can play the rest of the year because he needs to get his act together. He doesn't want to injure himself further.

""There's going to be mental pain I feel, but physically you don't want to put yourself out for a couple of months if there is something.""



Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova played her last-ever match at the All England Club on Tuesday, losing 6-3 6-1 to No.10 seed Emma Navaro.

And the former world No. 2 decided to get on the media intercom system to announce her last press conference. ""This is Petra Kvitova,"" she said, before announcing that she was heading in for her presser.

Another announcement came a few moments later, saying: ""That was Petra Kvitova announcing her final press conference in the main media theatre.""

Heather Watson has insisted that she has no plans to retire after suffering yet another early Wimbledon exit.

She was beaten by Clara Tauson despite winning the first set, marking the ninth time she has been dumped out in the opening round.

Asked if that might have been her last match at SW19, Watson replied: ""Hopefully not. That's not my plan.

""I want to play as long as I'm still playing tournaments like this. I was so grateful for the opportunity when the tournament gave me the wildcard, because this for me is the pinnacle.

""Like when I walked out onto court today, I got a little bit emotional, because it's so special.

""I just appreciate it so much any time I get to be a part of this tournament, so hopefully I've still got a few left in me and I can get there on my own next year.""

We've not even been playing for half an hour and Jack Draper is a third of the way to the second round.

He had the beating of Sebastian Baez all ends up there, putting him under pressure both on serve and against it.

It'll be over quickly at this rate, unless Baez finds another gear.

Ella Seidel retired during her match with Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in the second set after falling to the ground in pain.

The German qualifier appeared to twist her ankle and called for a medical time out at the back of the court.

The 20-year-old tried to play on in her first main draw match at Wimbledon, but was unable to continue and ended up conceding.



Jack Draper could hardly have hoped for a better start than this.

The Briton broke Sebastian Baez in the very first game of the match, and he's just broken him again to take an early 4-1 lead.

Baez will need to make more of an impact on serve if he is to prevent Draper running away with it.

There is a decent crowd at Court One to watch Jack Draper begin his Wimbledon campaign.

He has just made the perfect start, breaking Sebastian Baez to win the first game of the match.

Draper is widely considered Britain's great hope and the most likely home player to trouble the main contenders.

Can he make a winning start here? Or will he end up being the latest victim of another upset?

Iga Swiatek has admitted to smuggling towels out of every Grand Slam tournament due to floods of requests from her family and friends.

The Pole was pulled up by her Wimbledon interviewer for stacking her bag full after beating Polina Kudermetova on Tuesday, and her response was comical.

""Come on"" she smiled. ""It's a topic no one ever talks about. We love our towels. Every time I come back from a Slam I think I have like 10 friends and 10 family members wanting towels. So, sorry guys. Sorry Wimbledon. I don't know if I'm supposed to do that!""

Swiatek is only 24 but she turned professional almost a decade ago, and she has a huge amount of Grand Slam experience, having won four French Opens and two US Open titles. That, it turns out, has landed her and her loved ones more towels than they could ever have dreamed of.

""I have a lot at home,"" she added. ""Trust me. I don't need many more. If I'm going play like 15 more years on tour I can't even imagine. I think I'm going to have to build another room in my house just for Grand Slam towels.""



Wimbledon announced that they would be breaking protocol on Centre Court to allow today's losing player, Petra Kvitova, to address the crowd in an interview.

Kvitova lost to 10th seed Emma Navarro in her final ever match at SW19. She is retiring this year after the US Open.

The Czech icon won two titles at the All England Club in 2011 and 2014 and is recognised as one of the sport's greatest-ever players.

Martina Navratilova, her long-time rival, was in tears on BBC commentary and said: “It's hard for me to talk right now, she's just such a nice person on and off the court, a role model everywhere.""

""This place holds the best memories I could wish for."" \u2728Petra Kvitova says farewell to the #Wimbledon crowd pic.twitter.com/am0r3H16Iu

Here's a look at what's coming up on the main courts at Wimbledon tomorrow...

Centre Court (not before 1.30pm)

Aryna Sabalenka vs Marie Bouzkova

Oliver Tarvet vs Carlos Alcaraz

Emma Raducanu vs Marketa Vondrousova

Court One (not before 1pm)

Cameron Norrie vs Frances Tiafoe

Katie Boulter vs Solana Sierra

Taylor Fritz vs Gabriel Diallo

Dan Evans could face Novak Djokovic in the second round after winning an all-British affair with Jay Clarke.

And the 35-year-old is desperate for a potential blockbuster to be put on Centre Court, if Djokovic comes through his opener against Frenchman Alexandre Muller today.

""I would love it to be on Centre,"" he told the BBC. ""That's it, that's all I ask. Just to get a chance to play him. I have played him before and it would be really nice to play Novak, who if he won't mind me saying is at the latter end of his career.

""And I really want to go out there and give it a good go. Because it's here, it's really special and for it to be in England against the greatest of all time.""



There has been another upset on Court Three with reigning Olympic champion Qinwen Zheng falling at the first hurdle.

She has been beaten in three sets by Katerina Siniakova, who is unseeded.

Zheng would have been hoping for a deep run at SW19 but will instead be left to mull over what went wrong.

Dan Evans defeated fellow Brit Jay Clarke in straight sets, but the match was not without controversy.

Evans was accused by BBC commentators of using the “dark arts” to make his opponent “salty” during a tense second set.

Evans had won the first 6-1, but Clarke stepped his game up in the second and lost 7-5, after complaining to the umpire about his fellow Brit's conduct between serves.

Clarke asked the umpire about Evans “walking to the side and then walking back” before asking “is that normal?”

BBC commentator Dominic Inglot explained: ""Dan Evans is a master of the dark arts, let's say, and he's used them extremely well there. You could say Jay Clarke is right, but on the flip side he has to be mentally tougher than that.

“He can't be falling for those little tricks. A few extra seconds is not the end of the world. Maybe a little bit salty there after getting broken.""

Evans went on to seal his place in the second round for the first time in four years by taking the third set 6-2. A potential tie with Novak Djokovic awaits.

Last year's Wimbledon semi-finalist Lorenzo Musetti crashed out 12 months later in the first round to Georgian qualifier Nikoloz Basilashvili.

World No. 126 Basilashvili upset Musetti 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 and secured his first-ever win at a Grand Slam.

And Musetti blamed his lack of preparation on grass.

""I was struggling to feel comfortable on the court from the beginning,"" he said.

""Even in the lateral movements, which normally I know how to move, seemed like I'd never played on this surface. It was a really bad performance.""



No. 28 seed Alexander Bublik has just become the latest top player to suffer a massive upset in the first round.

The recent Halle champion was projected to meet British No. 1 Jack Draper in the third round - a rematch of their recent French Open clash, where Bublik sent the world No. 4 packing.

But Jaume Munar stunned the Kazakh in five sets, and Draper no longer has Bublik lurking in his section.

Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa have fuelled rumours of a split by unfollowing each other on Instagram.

Tsitsipas has also seemingly removed all pictures of Badosa from his profile.

The couple went public with their relationship in 2023 before temporarily breaking up last summer.

They got back together just weeks later but there are now strong suggestions that they have gone their separate ways again.

Both players were off the boil at Wimbledon and lost in the first round on Monday.

They are still due to play together in the US Open mixed doubles event later this year.

Taylor Fritz was not happy last night after he was forced to end his match early with Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard last night.

The pair were into the final hour of play before the umpire called time and told both players to return for a fifth set the following day.

They did just that on Court 1.

And it was the American who came out on top by breaking his big-serving opponent in the final set and taking the first of his three match points.

Barbora Krejcikova has made a winning start to her Wimbledon title defence.

She beats Alexandra Eala in three sets, coming from behind to secure a 3-6 6-2 6-1 victory.

Krejcikova was made to work hard but ultimately did enough to win and book her place in the second round.



Wimbledon star Daria Kasatkina admitted that she was so nervous that she needed to throw up before her first-round match.

The Aussie defeated Emiliana Arango in straight sets, but she struggled before stepping onto Court 14 and had to vomit.

""I'm happy how I was able to manage those nerves because at the start of the day was very, very tough for me,"" she said. ""The little accident happened completely out of nerves.

""There was nothing else wrong with me except this. Not having enough confidence, losing a couple of matches, the first match of the day….this doesn't help me to feel more calm.

""As soon as I stepped onto the court, it was much better. But before the match, I was so stressed, maybe too much.""

Jannik Sinner admitted that he was surprised by the scorching heat at Wimbledon after beating Luca Nardi in straight sets.

In his on-court interview, he said: ""I'm very, very happy to come back here. Playing against an Italian is very unfortunate but the atmosphere, as always, was amazing.

""I know it's very hot and humid, I don't remember the last time it was like this in London.

""We have worked a lot on the serve. I felt like I served very well in the important moments.

""I'm very happy with how I ended the match and hopefully that gives me the confidence to start the next match well.""

Dan Evans has taken the first set against fellow Brit Jay Clarke.

And it was fairly straightforward, with the 35-year-old storming to a 6-1 victory in the opening exchanges.

He has since missed a break point in the second, however, and slapped his knee with his racket.

Clarke then saved another break point in a 17-shot rally and holds.



It's a comfortable final set for Sinner as he bagels Nardi and wins 6-4 6-3 6-0.

A much more seamless victory for the Italian than rival Carlos Alcaraz enjoyed.

Jannik Sinner started the second set with a hold, a break and then another hold to put him in the driving seat.

From there, he never relinquished control and won it 6-3.

He is two up and firmly in charge of this first-round match on Court 1.

Some very solid stuff being played by the top seed - the kind of tennis that should instil at least some fear in Carlos Alcaraz after his sloppy performance yesterday.

Two stars have already received medical timeouts in the opening hours today.

Katerina Siniakova has just received medication in her match against Qinwen Zheng, which is set to continue.

Meanwhile, Hamad Medjedovic has just been taken away from court to receive treatment on an injury that seems to be separate to the weather.

He trails Sebastian Offner 7-6.

A ball boy was replaced during Alex De Minaur's victory over Roberto Carballes Baena.

The reason for the change is said to have been due to the heat.

""We are just waiting for someone to replace a ball boy. They are not feeling well,"" said the umpire on Court 18.

Temperatures have exceeded 30 degrees celsius on a scorching hot day at the Championships.

Jannik Sinner is a set up on Court 1 after an opportune break of serve against Luca Nardi.

The Italian pair were level pegging throughout that first 48 minutes but Sinner turned it on at the perfect moment to notch a break in the 10th game and win 6-4.

A couple of Nardi mistakes helped the top seed but a majestic forehand down the line is what the crowd will take away.



Luca Nardi once joked that he was simply the ""guy who beat Novak Djokovic"".

The Italian, ranked 95th in the world, defeated Djokovic as lucky loser at last year's Indian Wells.

He will hope that even more people know his name after his clash with Jannik Sinner on Centre Court.

Yulia Putintseva called a spectator “dangerous” and “crazy” before suggesting that they could be carrying a knife.

Putintseva was beaten 6-0 6-0 by Amanda Anisimova yesterday and, midway through the first set, she alerted an individual to the umpire.

She asked the umpire: “Can you take him out? I'm not going to continue playing until he leaves. These people are dangerous, they're crazy. Maybe he has a knife and he will attack after, I don't know.”

Wimbledon say a situation on court was dealt with.

We're pushing 32 degrees Celsius on Court 1 and it's sweltering even in the shade.

Lord knows how Jannik Sinner and Luca Nardi are feeling in the direct sunlight. Scared, probably.

The heat got the better of a few players yesterday.

Top seed Sinner will hope he doesn't suffer the same fate today.

It's an all-Italian clash to get him going, and I'm sure he'll want to be back under the AC as soon as possible.

Manchester United fan Jack Draper has received a good luck message from the club ahead of his Wimbledon first-round match this afternoon.

The No. 4 seed will start his quest for glory in his home Grand Slam when he faces Sebastian Baez.

United wished him well on X, posting: ""British no.1 Jack Draper kicks off his #Wimbledon campaign later today! Wishing you the best of luck, Jack.""

Elisabetta Cocciaretto has revealed that she was in hospital during Wimbledon last year.

The Italian is the latest underdog to take down a seeded star in the first round this time around, sensationally beating Jessica Pegula in straight sets.

Cocciaretto said on court: “For sure I played with a player like her before, Iga [Swiatek], Aryna [Sabalenka], all of those players that you have to do the best you can on the court and take the little chances they give you.

“I tried to do the opposite to what I did in the other matches. To be more aggressive, to go for it and don't think about winning or losing the point, just do your best. I think I did a great job today and I'm super happy about that.

“I had a lot of stops last year. I was in hospital and I was sick for one month and I couldn't play here. That's why I was so pumped to play because I think it's the best tournament and grass is always special to play.

“I don't think too much about my ranking right now. With the ranking, you can play other tournaments. The journey of tennis is so long and up and down always. You have to adapt yourself and enjoy and accept what happens in life.”



No. 3 seed Jessica Pegula has suffered the biggest upset of the tournament so far at Wimbledon. She's the 11th seed to lose so far at SW19, and day two is barely underway. Here are all the top players to go out so far.

Seeds out on day one:

MEN'S

9th seed Daniil Medvedev

24th seed Stefanos Tsitsipas via retirement

16th seed Francisco Cerundolo

20th seed Alexei Popyrin

8th seed Holger Rune

32nd seed Matteo Berrettini

31st seed Tallon Griekspoor

WOMEN'S

20th seed Jelena Ostapenko

32nd seed McCartney Kessler

9th seed Paula Badosa

Seeds out on day two:

WOMEN'S

3rd seed Jessica Pegula

Nick Kyrgios has cheekily suggested that Emma Raducanu is in a 'love triangle' with Carlos Alcaraz and Jack Draper.

Raducanu and Alcaraz have been the subject of romance rumours ahead of their upcoming mixed doubles partnership at the US Open, although the British women's No. 1 insists their relationship is purely platonic.

Some Alcaraz fans feared that Kyrgios might be trying to muscle in when he left a supportive comment on one of Raducanu's recent Instagram posts. The Aussie, who is working for talkSPORT after being dropped by the BBC, was asked on Tuesday for his take on the obsession with Raducanu's love life.

And he jokingly responded: ""I don't know, I think it's a love triangle! Draper, Alcaraz, Raducanu. They're fighting over Raducanu I think, I'm not sure.""



Harriet Dart has partially blamed the heat on her first-round defeat against Dalma Galfi.

The British star lost in three sets and argued that the home favourites are not well equipped to deal with the blazing temperatures, which are set to exceed 30 degrees celsius this week.

“It was challenging but it's the same for everyone,” she said. “I don't think I've played a match where it was this hot on grass.

“We're not very well equipped in this country to deal with it, so it becomes more of a shock. I've played in hotter places but here it's a shock because even when you go inside it's still pretty warm, so you can't escape it.

“It was difficult with half the sun on the court and half of it in shade. I was slow to adapt to seeing the ball but she served really well, particularly in big moments.”

The daughter of the spectator who was taken ill during Carlos Alcaraz's Wimbledon first-round win against Fabio Fognini has thanked the Spaniard on social media.

Alcaraz's five-set victory on Centre Court was suspended during the decider as medical personnel attended to a fan.

The reigning two-time champion quickly provided assistance by rushing over with a water bottle before the spectator was guided out of the stands.

This morning, the fan's daughter took to social media to show Alcaraz her gratitude after his actions.

Eluned Lewis wrote on X: ""Thank you @carlosalcaraz for the concern shown to my mum today, who was taken ill during your tennis match at Centre Court @Wimbledon today. Unlikely you'll see this message, but I can try! Thank you @BBCSport.""

Thank you @carlosalcaraz for the concern shown to my mum today who was taken ill during your tennis match at Centre Court @Wimbledon today. Unlikely you\u2019ll see this message but I can try! Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f @BBCSport

Novak Djokovic is about to begin his bid for Wimbledon glory against a tennis star with an unusual sponsorship deal.

And while Alexandre Muller insists that his affiliation with OnlyFans is not exactly what it seems, the 28-year-old still refers to himself as 'the sexiest professional tennis player from France'.

Muller said in an interview with The Sun: ""[OnlyFans] wants to change their image. They are supporting lots of players, golfers, boxers, UFC fighters... a lot of sportsmen.

""At the beginning my friends were laughing at me. Then I showed them my platform and they said: ‘OK, it's very cool.' Everybody wants to sign up now.

""Do I post risque photos? No, no. I don't do it. Because I don't want to. My job is a tennis player, not making movies for adults. I received a lot of messages, saying: ‘Alex, can you show me this?' But not my body.""



John McEnroe bluntly described Carlos Alcaraz as looking as 'flat as a pancake' at Wimbledon.

Alcaraz made hard work of a five-set victory over Fabio Fognini.

McEnroe believes it was a 'wake-up call' for the Spaniard.

Speaking on the BBC, the three-time former champion said: “Carlos looked as flat as a pancake. Why? I don't know. Perhaps he assumed this Fognini would fall away pretty quickly.

""His serve was off, his forehand… to see him play like that was surprising. You've got to give Fognini credit, but he was up a set and 4-2. He should have won the second set.

“He was up 4-2 or 5-3 in the third and he barely pulled that set out. He got blown out in the fourth. It's a good wake-up call for him. He won Queen's, everything was perfect, same as last year.

""He won the French Open, pulls out an incredible match [against Jannik Sinner], parties in Ibiza with his buddies, comes to Queen's and almost loses early, but goes on and wins it. Perhaps it's going to be similar here.”



We are underway on day two at Wimbledon, with lots of matches getting started at 11am.

Great Britain's Heather Watson is currently in action against Denmark's Clara Tauson on BBC Two.

Elsewhere, British wildcard Johannus Monday has started his tough test against world No. 13 Tommy Paul.

Sonay Kartal successfully sought revenge over 20th seed Jelena Ostapenko at Wimbledon.

The British star defeated Ostapenko in three sets, a mere few days after losing to the Latvian in Eastbourne.

“I felt great coming into it, so to get that kind of win, I've got masses of confidence,” Kartal said.

“I don't think that I could have done too much better at times in that match. I feel like this is the best I've ever played on grass. It's the most confident I've also got in my game. I think I'm in a pretty good spot for round two.”



Daniil Medvedev admits he is suffering from a lack of confidence after crashing out of Wimbledon in round one yesterday.

The Russian had already exited the Australian Open in the second round and French Open at the first hurdle.

And he lost to world No. 64 Benjamin Bonzi in four sets at SW19 to continue his nightmare run.

“For me, it's a matter of confidence. If not for the results in Halle, I would be here and say something is definitely missing. It's just a matter of a couple of matches,"" Medvedev reacted.

""This year, I lost a lot of close calls. When I start winning them, I can climb up the rankings. For the moment, I'm not that worried.

""If I finish the year ranked somewhere around No. 15 in the world, maybe I'll be more worried. For the moment, I'm not.""

Yulia Putintseva asked the chair umpire to remove a 'crazy' spectator during her first-round defeat at Wimbledon on Monday.

The Kazakhstani was only on court for 44 minutes as she was thrashed 6-0 6-0 by Amanda Anisimova.

And she was evidently bothered by someone in the crowd. Putintseva said to the umpire: ""Can you take him out because maybe he has a knife, I am not going to continue playing until he leaves. These people are dangerous, they are crazy.""

An All England Club spokesperson later said: ""Following a complaint about the behaviour of a spectator at the match on Court 15, the chair umpire informed security and the matter was dealt with.""



Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard broke the record for the fastest serve at Wimbledon last night.

During his ultimately suspended clash with Taylor Fritz on Court No. 1, the 6ft 8in giant tossed the ball down the court at an astonishing 149mph.

That eclipses the previous record of 148pmh set by Taylor Dent in 2010.

Carlos Alcaraz and Aryna Sabalenka are the current bookmakers' favourites to triumph in this year's Wimbledon singles, according to Betway.

Carlos Alcaraz – 5/4

Jannik Sinner – 7/4

Wimbledon have been urged to ditch their strict all-white kit policy.

The rules were tightened in the mid 1990s to dictate that all players must wear all-white kit on court, including tracksuits and other clothing.

Women have since been told they can wear dark undershorts to prevent anxiety during their menstrual cycles.

Billie Jean King believes the 1995 rule change was a ""total mistake"" and says television viewers struggle to tell players apart during matches.

She told the Telegraph: “There's a match that comes on, you sit down, and you look – let's say it's television – who's who?

“Tennis people say: ‘Well, the mark is next to their name' [to indicate who is serving]. I shouldn't have to look at a mark, I shouldn't have to look at anything. I should know [who's who]. My sport drives me nuts.”

Jack Draper can go all the way and win his first Grand Slam at this year's Wimbledon, claims 1994 champion Conchita Martinez.

“He's number four in the world, so he's already there. He's up with the top players,"" Martinez told BoyleSports.

“He's a great guy, and he won the men's title at Indian Wells when Mirra won the women's title, and we saw what he was like practising on the court. He has a great level of focus.

“You can tell when a player really wants it. He is very professional. I didn't see him play a lot, but then you pay attention, and he can play on any surface. He is already there; he's beaten top players.

“Carlos and Jannik are a bit ahead of Jack. He needs to be consistent the whole year. He needs to be consistent from the baseline to play against these guys. Jack has the game to go to the net and be aggressive, but you're up against two guys who can produce amazing shots.

“Jack has a very good chance of making the semi-finals at Wimbledon. Once you get to the semi-finals, why not go all the way? I think Alcaraz will be suitable for Jack's game. He has the potential to go all the way.”



Rising British star Oliver Tarvet has theoretically banked £99,000 at Wimbledon this year.

But rather harsh circumstances mean the qualifier will not see most of that money following a run that will see him meet Carlos Alcaraz in round two.

Tarvet, 21, is the lowest-ranked player in the singles draw at world No. 733. He still attends to San Diego University and intends to complete his final year.

His amateur status combined with American college rules mean Tarvet is only allowed to claim £7,290 as his own, in addition to genuine tennis expenses - which will at least allow him to enter more prestige tournaments than before.

The rest of the money is paid to his university.

Tarvet joked: “I've got to find £60,000 – £70,000 of expenses – tennis is an expensive sport.

“I hope to get the prize money and use that money as expenses. I will try and do everything I can to make that work out and to find X amount of expenses so I'm under $10,000 of profit.

""[It's] something I've got to figure out. Maybe I will hire someone to help me out with the expenses, make sure the NCAA are happy. It's very important for me. I have a lot of goals at USD still.”

Nick Kyrgios has backed Coco Gauff to progress beyond the Wimbledon fourth round for the first time ever this summer.

The 21-year-old has two Grand Slams to her name but has never enjoyed a long run in SW19.

Kyrgios believes that should change in the coming weeks.

""She has an incredible backhand and she's an incredible athlete,” Kyrgios told talkSPORT.

“The grass is a little bit faster. It's a faster surface, and I think her forehand swing sometimes can get a bit large on the grass and catch it a bit late.

“But you look at some of the results that she's had over the last six months, and I think confidence-wise she's fixed those existing problems on a second serve as well.

“She had those problems where she was double-faulting a lot. She had a bit of the yips on a second serve.

“So I think she's fixed those, and I think you know serving at Wimbledon is the most important thing. You have to be serving well to win Wimbledon.”

It is expected to be another scorching hot day at Wimbledon.

Temperatures across London and parts of the south-east of England are forecast to reach as high as 34 degrees celsius.

Express Sport explained the rules that are in place when temperatures reach such levels here.

Ons Jabeur says she will take a break to ‘disconnect' from tennis after she retired from Wimbledon.

The former finalist was in tears as she called for a medical timeout during her match against Viktoriya Tomova.

She attempted to continue but eventually retired while trailing 7-6 2-0.

""I wasn't expecting not to feel good,"" said Jabeur. ""I've been practising pretty well the last few days but I guess these things happen. I'm really sad.

""It doesn't really help me with my confidence and what I keep pushing myself to do, even though it was a very tough season for me. So I hope I'm going to feel better and we'll see what's going to happen.

""[I will] definitely try to disconnect a little bit from tennis and try to just enjoy life outside tennis, recover and spend a little bit of time with the family and hopefully that could recharge me. Definitely ‘rest' is the word for it.""

John McEnroe has told Fabio Fognini to retire after his defeat against Carlos Alcaraz.

Fognini, 38, was playing in his 15th Wimbledon and recently hinted that he was going to step away from the tour.

He took two sets from the world No. 2 and was backed by the majority of the Centre Court crowd.

""This was the perfect ending for Fognini,"" McEnroe told the BBC.

""Luckily for Alcaraz, towards the end of the fourth set, the crowd realised that Fognini was playing unbelievable. Carlos looked more tired than Fognini even though there's a 16-year age gap! What in the hell is going on here?

""So the crowd started rallying behind Alcaraz and that picked him up a little bit. I almost hope that [Fognini] doesn't play anymore because I'm not sure he can play any better than that.

""I played [Fognini's wife] Flavio Panetta in seniors mixed doubles at the French [Open] and she thinks it's time for Fabio to be at home more with the kids. I think she is ready for her husband to be home more.""



Wimbledon could face chaos today with suspended matches added to the updated order of play.

Several matches were halted before the 11pm curfew last night, including those involving Alexander Zverev and Taylor Fritz.

Those matches have been added to their respective courts in the second slot of the day.

It leaves bosses with a potential headache as some courts are set to host up to five matches.

Centre Court will have four ties, the same as yesterday. Court No. 3 will host five.

Novak Djokovic has been given a brutal reality check ahead of his Wimbledon campaign.

It is widely accepted that Wimbledon provides the Serb's final opportunity to land a coveted 25th Grand Slam title.

But former tennis star Feliciano Lopez says Djokovic is not on the same level as rivals Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner anymore.

“He's not at the levels of Carlos and Jannik, especially in the last 18 months, because the numbers speak for themselves,” the three-time Wimbledon quarter-finalist told Sky Sports.

“Although the gap is still big, I see the grass as the only place for him to get to this level that they play because the grass is very different.

“Djokovic proved that he can still compete at this level but he will have a better chance on grass.”

Taylor Fritz fumed at a Wimbledon umpire after his match was suspended at around 10.20pm yesterday.

Wimbledon's curfew is not until 11pm but Fritz's clash with Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard was halted 40 minutes prior.

The American had just battled back to win the fourth set and send the match into a deciding set.

To a chorus of boos, Fritz ranted at the umpire, believing there was more than enough time for a final set to take place.

Their match will resumed today.



Never at Wimbledon have seven Brits all won on the same day.

It is testament to the strength of the British game that the country has so many top players in the first round this year.

Katie Boulter saw off ninth seed Paula Badosa on Centre Court, while Emma Raducanu defeated Mimi Xu in an all-British clash.

Sonay Kartal beat 20th-seed Jelena Ostapenko in immediate revenge for her Eastbourne loss.

Oliver Tarvet continued his remarkable as a qualifier, winning as the No. 733-ranked player in the world.

Arthur Fery, Cam Norrie and Billy Harris all progressed.

Hello and welcome back to Express Sport's coverage of Wimbledon.

We'll have regular updates throughout the day as the second halves of the first-round matches are played.

Stay tuned...

Alexander Zverev will head into day two of Wimbledon on a level playing field with Arthur Rinderknech.

The German wins a second-set tiebreak before play is suspended for the night ahead of the 11pm curfew.

The two players will resume their first-round battle tomorrow with everything still to play for.

Former tennis star Todd Woodbridge believes that Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard should be over the moon with the decision to suspend his Wimbledon first-round clash with Taylor Fritz.

The big-serving Frenchman had just lost two sets on the bounce when match officials opted to call it off and pick it back up tomorrow with the 11pm curfew closing in.

With the scores at two sets apiece, Woodbridge said: ""I'm a little surprised by that decision. I think the referee has come out too early, he could've given them the option. We still had 45 minutes to go to curfew.

""The sets that we had have all been under 45 minutes, they've been close to it but there was definitely the chance of an outcome there tonight.

""I think Mpetshi Perricard, good for him, he should get off and be very happy with that. Taylor Fritz will be a little annoyed by that decision I have no doubt because he played an exceptional tiebreak from 5-1 down to hang in.""

The match between Taylor Fritz and Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard has been suspended for the night in bizarre fashion.

It caused frustration in the crowd, with many fans booing the announcement which came 40 minutes before the 11pm curfew.

Fritz, who had just edged a fourth-set tiebreak to force a deciding set, was also left raging with the decision.

He was well within his rights to be upset, given that there would probably have been enough time for the match to reach a conclusion.

Spare a thought for the paying ticket-holders who have seemingly been denied the full value of their money.



Holger Rune was left frustrated after throwing away a two-set lead against Nicolas Jarry earlier today.

The Dane was in control until the return of a troublesome knee injury saw him slip to a 4-6 4-6 7-5 6-3 6-4 loss.

After the match, Rune had some interesting words for Jarry while discussing his defeat.

He said: ""If I play normal, I'm beating him nine out of ten times, with all respect for Nicolas Jarry.

""I'm going to check now with the head doctor and physio and will take it from there.

""I don't know if it's worse now, or better, or the same. It needs to be examined.""

Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard broke a long-standing Wimbledon record during his match against Taylor Fritz.

The towering Frenchman, who stands at six feet and eight inches tall, pulled off thunderous services of 151mph and 153mph.

It saw him surpass the previous benchmark of 148mph, which was set by Taylor Dent back in 2010.

Mpetshi Perricard currently leads Fritz by two sets to one, with his American opponent battling to avoid an early exit.

John McEnroe wants Fabio Fognini to retire following his spirited defeat to Carlos Alcaraz on Monday.

The Italian is in the midst of his final season as a professional and McEnroe thinks that his last outing at Wimbledon would be the ideal note on which to end his career.

""This was the perfect ending for Fognini,"" the American told the BBC. ""Luckily for Alcaraz, towards the end of the fourth set, the crowd realised that Fognini was playing unbelievable. Carlos looked more tired than Fognini even though there's a 16-year age gap! What in the hell is going on here?

""So the crowd started rallying behind Alcaraz and that picked him up a little bit. I almost hope that [Fognini] doesn't play anymore because I'm not sure he can play any better than that.

""I played [Fognini's wife] Flavio Panetta in seniors mixed doubles at the French [Open] and she thinks it's time for Fabio to be at home more with the kids. I think she is ready for her husband to be home more.""



Play on the outdoor courts has been suspended for poor light.

Botic van de Zandschulp led Matteo Arnaldi by two tiebreak sets on Court 12 when they had to stop.

And Shintaro Mochizuki had just forced a fifth and final set against Giulio Zeppieri when their match was abandoned for the night.

With seven wins in the singles, it has been the most successful day for British players at Wimbledon in the Open era.

As well as Boulter, there were victories for Cameron Norrie, Arthur Fery, Sonay Kartal, Emma Raducanu, Oliver Tarvet and Billy Harris.

Some of those were huge upsets and it remains to be seen how the British contingent will fare in the second round.

There has been ANOTHER huge upset at Wimbledon and this time it's courtesy of Katie Boulter.

She beats Paula Badosa in three sets to become the seventh Briton to reach the second round.

It's been a brilliant opening day for the home contingent and Boulter looks delighted after securing her own surprise victory.

She will go up against Solana Sierra in her next match on Wednesday.

Nick Kyrgios was spotted in Naomi Osaka's box to watch her beat Talia Gibson earlier today.

The outspoken Aussie is due to link up with Osaka in the mixed doubles tournament at the US Open later this year.

He would have been impressed with the relatively straightforward manner of her 6-4 7-6 victory on Court 18.

Yulia Putintseva suffered a humbling fall from grace just under 12 months after her barnstorming Wimbledon win over Iga Swiatek. The only positive she can take is that the suffering didn't last long, as her bid for glory at SW19 was ended in just 43 minutes by Amanda Anisimova.

Putintseva went on the best Wimbledon run of her career in 2024. Her march to the round of 16 included big wins over 27th seed Katerina Siniakova in round two and top seed Swiatek in round three. But this grass-court season has been considerably less successful.

With only 30 per cent of points won on her first serve and zero break point opportunities in the entire match, Putintseva was thrashed 6-0 6-0 by 13th seed Anisimova in a one-sided mauling on Court 15.

And she didn't take it especially well. During a changeover, Putintseva was seen sobbing into her towel with both hands covering her face as the crowd watched on.



No. 5 seed Qinwen Zheng's first-round match against Katerina Siniakova has been cancelled.

They were due to play fourth on Court 3 but play has run over, as former finalist and 32nd seed Matteo Berrettini is locked in battle with Kamil Majchrzak.

There was an almighty cheer on Court 1 after Emma Raducanu's victory, as the fans were informed they were getting a fourth bonus match - Taylor Fritz vs Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.

And the roof was closed on Wimbledon's second-biggest showcourt before the tall, big-servers took to the stage.

It's almost 8pm and the light and visibility will soon become an issue - especially on Centre and 1 which are surrounded by a bowl-like structure. And organisers decided to shut the Court 1 roof before the match started so they could turn on the floodlights.

We could have a similar scenario on Centre - Boulter vs Badosa still isn't done and the Zverev vs Rinderknech match is due after.

Paula Badosa is hitting her stride against Katie Boulter, with the Spaniard having just taken the second set.

It means a decider will be required to split the two players on Centre Court.

The momentum is with the ninth seed and Boulter will need to dig deep to turn things around.

Emma Raducanu was in a jovial mood after beating Mingge Xu to reach the second round.

The match was briefly disrupted when a fan in the stands popped open a bottle of champagne and the cork went flying over her head.

Raducanu thought it was hilarious and went over to pick up the cork, waving it in the air and offering it back to the spectators.

Reflecting on the incident in her post-match interview, the young Brit said: ""I'm glad people were having fun today.

""I saw a champagne cork fly onto the court so that was fun, glad you guys are having a good time, cheers to you.""

Katie Boulter has just stormed into the lead against ninth seed Paula Badosa.

The first set has gone the way of the Brit, who is halfway to pulling off another Wimbledon upset.

She is aiming to become the seventh home player to book a place in the next round.



Emma Raducanu makes the perfect start to her Wimbledon campaign with a routine victory over Mingge Xu.

The former US Open champion secures a 6-3 6-3 triumph, having been on top for the duration of the contest.

Katie Boulter, meanwhile, has just broken Paula Badosa in the early stages of their match over on Centre Court.

Carlos Alcaraz paid a touching tribute to Fabio Fognini after knocking him out of what looks to be his final Wimbledon.

The Spaniard was pushed all the way by the Italian veteran in an entertaining five-set thriller on Monday afternoon.

""I don't know why it's his last Wimbledon, because the level he is playing, he can still play for three or four more years,"" said Alcaraz. ""I have to give him the credit for such a great match.

""Fabio is a great player. He has shown his level and talent over his whole career. I'm just a little bit sad that it's probably his last Wimbledon but I'm happy to have shared the court and the locker room with him, and we are going to enjoy the last of him.""

Carlos Alcaraz is safely through to the second round after a titanic battle with Fabio Fognini.

He wins the decisive fifth set after a 15-minute delay for a medical emergency in the crowd.

The final score is 7-5 6-7 7-5 2-6 6-1 in favour of the reigning Wimbledon champion.

He will face either Dan Evans or Jay Clarke in the second round later this week.



Emma Raducanu is already a set up against Mingge Xu on Court One.

The former US Open champion is looking strong and will be hoping to close out the match without being taken the distance.

Carlos Alcaraz's match with Fabio Fognini has been stopped due to a medical emergency in the crowd.

Play was paused as the umpire announced a break of play after Alcaraz went into his bag to grab a bottle of water and give it to the person involved.

The umpire said: ""Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately there has been an incident with a spectator. Health and safety is our priority. We will be pausing the match.""

What is happening to Carlos Alcaraz!?

He loses the fourth set with a whimper as Fabio Fognini regains the upper hand.

This certainly wasn't in the script for the defending champion. He looks all over the place and needs to find a solution quickly.

It's going the distance on Centre Court.



Emma Raducanu's first-round match against British teenage wildcard Mimi Xu is about to start on Court 1.

There's an excited chatter around Wimbledon's second showcourt as the Brits take to the stage.

You can follow live score updates here.

Joao Fonseca apologised for beating British star Jacob Fearnley on Court 1.

""I'm sorry, winning against a British guy but thanks a lot for the support here,"" Fonseca said.

""Thanks for respecting the tennis today. Jacob is a great friend and great player. I am looking forward to the next meeting against him.""

He added: ""At the beginning of the match both of us were very nervous. We were just making serves and there were no rallies. Very nervous.""

There's been another huge upset in the men's singles draw. No. 8 seed Holger Rune suffered defeat at the hands of qualifier Nicolas Jarry after leading by two sets to love.

But former world No.16 Jarry, whose ranking has slipped outside the top 140, stormed back to win 4-6 4-6 7-5 6-3 6-4.

Rune is the second top-10 ATP star to lose on Monday after Daniil Medvedev was stunned by Benjamin Bonzi.

Jacob Fearnley is out of Wimbledon after losing at the hands of Joao Fonseca.

It ends 6-4 6-1 7-6 in favour of the Brazilian teenager on Court One.

Emma Raducanu is next up against Mingge Xu and you can follow game-by-game updates via our dedicated match blog.



Carlos Alcaraz breaks Fabio Fognini to win the third set on Centre Court.

The young Spaniard is now just one set away from reaching the second round.

Fognini is throwing everything at the reigning Wimbledon champion and can still go the distance if he takes the fourth set.

Alcaraz, however, has the momentum back on his side and will be hugely difficult to stop.

Stefanos Tsitsipas has suggested that he could retire from tennis after being forced to withdraw from Wimbledon due to injury.

Earlier today, he retired from his opening match against Valentin Royer after the end of the second set.

Tsitsipas has since opened up on his injury problems in a heartbreaking press conference.

He said: ""I feel like I'm left without answers. I don't know. I've tried everything.

""It's probably the most difficult situation that I've ever been faced with, because it's an ongoing issue that doesn't seem to be disappearing or fading off as much.

""Myself, as a person, I have a limit at some point, so I'll definitely have to have my final answer on whether I want to do stuff or not in the next couple of months.

""This is going to be hard, but if I see it going in that trajectory, there is no point at competing.""

Arthur Fery pulls off another Wimbledon shock by securing a 6-4 6-1 4-6 6-4 victory over Alexei Popyrin.

Fery, who is ranked outside the world's top 400, had never won a tour-level match before today.

It is arguably the biggest surprise of the day, coming just hours after Sonay Kartal dumped out Jelena Ostapenko.

Fery will face either Roman Safiullin or Luciano Darderi in the second round on Wednesday.



Fabio Fognini prevails in a tiebreak to claim the second set in his match against Carlos Alcaraz.

The experienced Italian is producing some fine tennis, which is making his Spanish rival work hard.

He has momentum on his side but will need to keep it up to spring a surprise against the defending champion.

You can follow game-by-game updates via our dedicated match blog.

Joao Fonseca is a set up against Jacob Fearnley here on Court 1.

The Brit hasn't been able to find his serve and gave away five double faults to trail 6-4.

Fonseca win the final game on Fernley's serve to love.

Sir Gareth Southgate and Sir David Beckham are both in the royal box today, fresh from receiving their honours at Buckingham Palace.

They watched on as Carlos Alcaraz played Fabio Fognini.



Oliver Tarvet will be unable to claim the majority of his £99,000 prize for reaching the second round.

He attends university in the United States and the rules of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) require athletes to stay amateur.

Tarvet is able to claim up to £7,282 in expenses as well as the expenses he has incurred during the tournament.

However, it means the young Brit will miss out on the vast majority of his Wimbledon payout, which will go to his university.

Fabio Fognini smacked his racket on the floor after being broken by Carlos Alcaraz in the second set.

The Italian shouted in anger after losing his serve and hit his racket multiple times in frustration.



Aryna Sabalenka was delighted with her first-round win over Carson Branstine.

Walking down the tunnel, she clenched her fist and said ""vamos, vamos, vamos"" at an official holding a camera.



Jacob Fearnley has the lion's share of support here inside Court 1.

There is the odd 'come on Fonseca' being screamed from the stands but every point Fearnley wins drowns it out.

Another seed goes down as Stefanos Tsitsipas retires while trailing Valentin Royer 6-3 6-2.

He called the physio during the second set and played on. But after losing it 6-2, the 24th seed appeared to be asking Goran Ivanisevic whether he should continue, then told the umpire he was done.

It's Royer's first-ever tour-level match win.



I've just taken my place on Court 1 for Jacob Fearnley vs Joao Fonseca. I'm tipping this to be the match of the day.

Two rising stars have shown plenty of promise so far in 2025.

The big question is how many Brazilian fans will have tickets to this area that is basking in the south west London sun.

Fonseca's followers travel in their numbers and are known to make quite the noise...

No. 24 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas is in trouble. The two-time Grand Slam finalist is a set and double-break down to qualifier Valentin Royer and has called the physio.

He's receiving an on-court medical time-out on his back as new coach Goran Ivanisevic watches on from his box.



Ninth seed Daniil Medvedev - who has reached the semi-final here for two years running - has suffered a huge upset in the first round.

World No. 64 Benjamin Bonzi stunned the former No. 1 7-6(2) 3-6 7-6(3) 6-2 on Court 2, handing Medvedev his first-ever opening-round loss at Wimbledon, and went to embrace his team, who had been watching courtside.

Bonzi said: ""This is special for me today. This is my first top-10 win in a Slam, obviously it's always special in this tournament, the atmosphere, all the colours, the grass, the green.

""I love this place so it's very special, Daniil is a great player, he did two semi-finals so I knew it was a tough match but sometimes it's better to play this kind of player in the first round, anything can happen. So I'm very happy.""

Asked how he could be so calm, he replied: ""I'm pretty focusing to speak English right now! But one more time this is a great place to play tennis.

""I have maybe 20 people in my box so I'm really enjoying time here, I knew I can do something big today, it was maybe my day but I'm enjoying a lot.""

Fabio Fognini is exchanging games with Carlos Alcaraz on Centre Court.

He appeared to stretch out his hamstring after the opening point of the match but seems perfectly comfortable now.

Wildcard Oliver Crawford became the first Brit to lose a singles match at Wimbledon this year.

The world No. 248 too the first set over Italian star Mattia Bellucci but went out 6-7(3) 6-4 6-4.

It's been a successful day for the Brits otherwise so far, with Sonay Kartal and Oliver Tarvet winning.

Daniil Medvedev is on the brink of an early exit at Wimbledon as he is 2-1 behind and a break down in the fourth set against Benjamin Bonzi.

The 2021 US Open winner has reached the semi-finals at the All England Club in each of the last two years but will be sent packing unless he turns the match around quickly.

Sonay Kartal beat 20th seed Jelena Ostapenko.

The British star said afterwards: “Yeah I would say that was by far one of the toughest matches I've played, I struggle against the big hitters so to be able to get that win today after she beat me easily last week. I appreciate you guys coming out, when I needed it the most, you guys were there.

“After the year I had last year, I made a big conscious effort this year to play the bigger matches, to put myself under the most pressure I could on the court. I knew that maybe I wouldn't get the results straight away but eventually it would pay off and it did today.

“This tournament last year was probably the best tournament I've ever had and my most favourite. I left here last year feeling a much more confident player on and off the court. I knew my level was there, just eventually had to force it out of myself. This whole year I feel like I'm playing better, I'm improving each week. I want to see how far I can go this week.”

Oliver Tarvet has admitted he is overjoyed after defeating Leandro Riedi in the first round of Wimbledon.

“There's a lot of emotions,” explained the 21-year-old Briton. “I'm just really overjoyed to be in this situation you know. All of the hard work I've put in in the last few years has clearly paid off.

“I was just taking it match by match, just trying to see what I could do. Obviously it was my first Tour-level event and then to come out here, come through qualifying and also win in the first round at Wimbledon and have a chance to play maybe Carlos [Alcaraz] on Wednesday is just truly incredible.

“It's a dream come true for me to play here. It's really special. You work for these types of moments, you work to play on the most prestigious court in the world. It's just really special and I'm really thankful for everyone.”



It's a red-hot day at Wimbledon, as you may have heard.

The temperature on Centre Court right now is 30 degrees Celsius and it's only going to get hotter as the afternoon wears on.

Carlos Alcaraz and Fabio Fognini are first up - the firm favourite will be keen to wrap it up swiftly and get back under the AC.



Oliver Tarvet has seen out the match against Leandro Riedi and has booked his place in the second round after securing a 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 victory over the Swiss ace.

It's been a good day for the Britons so far, and Tarvet will join Sonay Kartal in the second round following her victory over Jelena Ostapenko.

Oliver Tarvet is about to serve for the match against Riedi.

He leads 6-4 6-4 5-4.

Ons Jabeur has said that she didn't expect to feel bad on the court after retiring from her first-round match at Wimbledon.

The two-time runner-up here broke down in tears 26 minutes into the match then took a medical time out but continued playing. She was trailing Viktoriya Tomova 7-6 2-0 when she threw in the towel.

Jabeur later said: “Yeah I mean I wasn't expecting not to feel good. I've been practising pretty well the last few days but I guess these things happen and yeah, I'm pretty sad. Doesn't really help me with my confidence and what I keep pushing myself to do even though it was a very tough season for me. So yeah, I hope I can feel better and see what's going to happen.”

As for what she'll do next, she added: “Definitely try to disconnect a little bit from tennis and try to just enjoy life outside tennis. Recover and spend a little bit of time with the family and hopefully that can recharge me. Otherwise, I don't know, I will try to definitely rest is the word for it.”

Sonay Kartal became the first Brit to win a match at Wimbledon this year, upsetting 20th seed and former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko 7-5 2-6 6-2.

Ostapenko beat Kartal just six days ago in Eastbourne but the world No.51 got her revenge and said: “I would say that was by far one of the toughest matches I've played, I struggle against the big hitters so to be able to get that win today after she beat me easily last week. I appreciate you guys coming out, when I needed it the most, you guys were there.”

Kartal reached the third round here as a qualifier ranked down at No. 298 in the world. She will now face world No. 111 Viktoriya Tomova in round two.

Daniil Medvedev has struck back against unseeded Frenchman Benjamin Bonzi by taking the second set 6-3.

The 29-year-old is aiming to turn the match around after losing the first set on a tiebreak. But he's a break down in the third set.

Medvedev reached back-to-back semi-finals at the All England Club in 2023 and 2024 and won the US Open in 2021.

Novak Djokovic accepts that Wimbledon could be his final chance to land a 25th Grand Slam title.

Djokovic's 24 majors is a men's singles record, but the competitive Serb is determined to win more.

He has won seven of those titles at Wimbledon and believes the grass courts are his best chance of adding to his tally.

Djokovic said: “I would probably agree that Wimbledon could be the best chance because of the results I had, because of how I feel, how I play at Wimbledon, just getting that extra push mentally and motivation to perform the best tennis at the highest level.”

Two-time finalist Ons Jabeur has retired from her opening match against Viktoriya Tomova.

Former world No. 2 Jabeur broke down in tears just 26 minutes into the first set and needed a medical time out but continued playing and lost it in a tiebreak.

She threw in the towel with Tomova leading 7-6(5) 2-0.



Ninth seed and two-time semi-finalist Daniil Medvedev is in trouble. The former world No. 1 has lost the first set of his match to Benjamin Bonzi on Court 2, 7-2 in the tiebreak.

Two-time Wimbledon semi-finalist Elina Svitolina became the first winner of this year's Championships.

The 14th seed beat Anna Bondar 6-3 6-1 on Court 18.

Oliver Crawford has joined Brits Sonay Kartal and Oliver Tarvet in going a set up at Wimbledon.

Crawford, the world No. 248, is up against Mattia Bellucci.

Famous faces have flocked to Wimbledon on day one of the tournament - although some are more familiar than others. Celeb spotters will not have had too much trouble recognising David Beckham in a recent Instagram post, but the one-time Wimbledon champion he was smiling alongside may have caught a few others out.

Former Manchester United, Real Madrid and England icon Beckham is a regular attendee at the All England Club. He has therefore done plenty of mingling with some of the biggest names in tennis, and one player he seems to have struck up a bond with is five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova.

Sharapova grinned from ear to ear as she sat alongside Beckham for a wholesome photo posted to her Instagram account, which was accompanied by the caption: ""Let the (Wimbledon) games begin"".

But she looked completely different from the leggy, blond-haired sports superstar fans came to know during her 19-year playing career.

Now, at 38 years old, Sharapova has ditched the light-coloured locks for shorter and darker hair, and the difference is striking.



With day one of Wimbledon now fully underway, the fans around the grounds will be flocking to the bars to enjoy a drink in the sunshine.

But they'll need to dig into their pockets, with pints of Stella costing £8.85 while Pimm's is £12.25 a cup, and there's a top-line wine on offer in one restaurant for £217.50.



Briton Oliver Tarvet was forced to come through qualifying to reach the Wimbledon main draw but has clinched the first set against Swiss opponent Leandro Riedi after winning it 6-4.

Fellow Briton Sonay Kartal, meanwhile, has won the first set 7-5 against 20th seed Jelena Ostapenko after fighting off set points and battling back from a break down. Could we be in for a memorable opening day for the home favourites?

Ons Jabeur called for a medical time-out in her match against Viktoriya Tomova.

Jabeur was in tears as she waited to have her vitals checked by a doctor.

She has returned to the court but is 3-2 down in the first set.

Aryna Sabalenka, who is the favourite to win the ladies' singles title this year, will take on Canadian model Carson Branstine in her opening match today. The showdown will be played on No. 1 Court at 1pm.

Branstine, who is currently ranked at No. 194 in the world, told CLAY: “I love being in front of a camera during a photoshoot. It's fun - I love fashion. It has been one of the reasons why I have been able to afford some trips. I didn't want to ask my parents for anything, I wanted everything to come from me and my tennis.”

She then boasted: “I would say that I am one of the best athletes on the circuit. I'm confident in that - I run fast, lift a lot of weight and I'm quite agile for how tall I am.”



Pablo Carreno Busta has withdrawn from Wimbledon.

The Spaniard was due to face Chris Rodesch in the first round.

It is unclear why he has withdrawn from the tournament.

Lucky loser Cristian Garin of Chile will take Carreno Busta's place in the first round.

There will be a host of star players to look out for on the outside courts today.

Two-time Grand Slam finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas will be in action on Court 12 after Frances Tiafoe makes an appearance on the same court.

And Leylah Fernandez, who lost to Emma Raducanu in the 2021 US Open final, will also feature on Court 12.

Two-time Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur will play on Court 14, with former Canadian Open champion Alexei Popyrin appearing on Court 15.

Meanwhile, Jiri Lehecka, who defeated Jack Draper in the Queen's semi-finals, will play his first round match on Court 17. Elsewhere, Cameron Norrie is on Court 18 and will take on Roberto Bautista Agut.



Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova will play at the All England Club for the final time at this year's tournament.

Kvitova was the women's singles champion in 2011 and 2014.

The 35-year-old faces 10th seed Emma Navarro in the first round.

""It´ll be amazing, for sure. It´s my favorite tournament. It always has been and it always will be. So it´ll be very nice to be back,"" Kvitova told The Associated Press.

""It´s always brought me so many memories. Some really good memories, of course. But also bad memories, because losing with the pressure there is hard.

“Even with the two best results of my career, I do feel like sometimes the losses were very, very painful. But at the end of the day, winning two titles is what counts the most.""

For the first time in the Open Era, the iconic sight of Wimbledon's line judges taking their positions will not be part of this year's tournament.

Rules and regulations have been brought in line with every other ATP Tour event, and most WTA Tour events, which now use electronic line calling.

All 18 courts will use the technology, which features an automated 'out' call. Players will be unable to challenge decisions as they have done in previous years.

Tennis -playing friends Linda, 62, and Aleta, 46, were the first on the scene but a few hours later queue experts Vicki and Nigel Broad from Neath in South Wales rocked up.

They all got chatting and once Linda and Aleta realised they were talking to seasoned Wimbledon queue experts in Vicki and Nigel they allowed the Brit pair to pitch their tent first.

Linda, who plays tennis with Aleta in a tennis team called Hotshots in Houston, explained: ""We just don't want to be first so we let them go ahead.""

While Linda admitted this was actually a bit of a tactic for them to avoid the full glare of media scrutiny on Monday morning, they were also happy to let some Brits be first in line in the 10,000 strong queue.

The queue is officially shut. Wimbledon CEO Sally Bolton has confirmed that the queue was closed around an hour ago due to it being at capacity.

Jannik Sinner has refused to explain why he sacked two members of his team on the eve of Wimbledon.

The world No. 1 dismissed fitness coach Marco Panichi and physiotherapist Ulises Badio. Both men were replacements for staff fired in the aftermath of Sinner's doping case, for which he voluntarily served a three-month ban.

No reason has been given for the departures of Panichi and Badio.

Sinner said: “Nothing seriously bad happened. They did great work for three months.

“Sometimes, things happen. The timing obviously isn't the best, but having done a lot of work before, it won't affect this Grand Slam a lot. I feel well physically and mentally and ready to compete.”



There will be plenty of big-hitters on No. 2 Court as well today, with Daniil Medvedev, Madison Keys and Jasmine Paolini all in action.

11am | Benjamin Bonzi vs Daniil Medvedev | Men's singles

Estimated 1pm | Elena-Gabriela Ruse vs Madison Keys | Ladies' singles

Estimated 2.30pm | Jasmine Paolini vs Anastasija Sevastova | Ladies' singles

Estimated 4pm | Taylor Fritz vs Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard | Men's singles

Wimbledon village has been buzzing all morning. Waiting staff were rushed off their feet as tennis fans flocked to SW19 well before the gates open at 10am. The Ivy in particular was packed out with staff donning green blazers.

I spoke to one gentleman on the way down to the All England CLub who had his queue card. He arrived at 4.55am and was position 3,800. He's hoping to get a groundspass.

Emma Raducanu's stalker was blocked from gaining entry to Wimbledon this week.

Ahead of the tournament, alarm bells were raised by the system that deals with the ticket ballot. A man who had followed Raducanu to events in Asia earlier this year, before handing her a letter and a signed photo, had attempted to purchase tickets through the ballot.

The name of the man - which has never been revealed to the public after he was given a restraining order by Dubai police - was black-listed by the tournament's system and he will not be on the grounds over the next fortnight.

Raducanu told the BBC last week: “When I heard that, my thoughts were that everyone at Wimbledon had done an amazing job. I got a notification and the police contacted me, they assured me everything was okay.

""I know that I'm not the first athlete to go through this and I probably won't be the last. Not just athlete, female in general. It's just something that maybe we all have to deal with at some point. I feel okay, I feel comfortable, I feel safe. I've had great protection whenever I've been at these events.

“At the tournaments, I have a lot more protection around me, especially the ones here in the UK, where there are most spectators around. I feel a difference and that reassures me, it makes me feel more comfortable.”

Raducanu faces British rising star Mimi Xu, 17, in the first round today.

Their match takes place on Court No. 1.

Aryna Sabalenka is first up on No. 1 Court today, with three Britons in action afterwards.

1pm | Aryna Sabalenka vs Carson Branstine | Ladies' singles

Estimated 3pm | Jacob Fearnley vs Joao Fonseca | Men's singles

Estimated 6pm | Emma Raducanu vs Mimi Xu | Ladies' singles

Wimbledon could be set for its hottest ever temperatures this week as a heatwave hits the south and east of England.

Temperatures could rise as high as 34 degrees celsius in parts of the country on Monday.

On Tuesday, parts of south-east England could then hit 35, according to forecaster Matthew Lenhart.

Since 1960, UK temperatures in June have only exceeded 34 degrees three times.

Last summer's tournament was disrupted by rain during the earlier rounds.



Carlos Alcaraz will get the Centre Court action underway this year as the defending men's champion. Briton Katie Boulter and German star Alexander Zverev will also be in action on the show court.

1.30pm | Fabio Fognini vs Carlos Alcaraz | Men's singles

Estimated 3.30pm | Paula Badosa vs Katie Boulter | Ladies' singles

Estimated 5pm | Arthur Rinderknech vs Alexander Zverev | Men's singles



Avocado enjoyers will be left disappointed in SW19 over the next fortnight.

In a bid to go greener than the courts, the popular fruit has reportedly been taken off the menu.

According to The Times, avocado has been replaced by crushed peas in a bold choice.

In addition, 30 of the 42 kitchens on site will not use gas. The showers used by players will be heated by solar thermal tubes.

Wimbledon fans reportedly walked out of the queue yesterday as the weather was too hot for them.

Stewards revealed to The Telegraph that fans had been leaving Wimbledon Park, where the queue starts, and telling them they would return when the weather was cooler.

It is forecast to hit 36 degrees Celsius at Wimbledon today, with the record temperature recorded during The Championships coming a decade ago as the temperature peaked at 35.7 degrees Celsius.

UK health officials have issued an amber heat health warning until 6pm tomorrow for the majority of the country, including Wimbledon.

Fabio Fognini banned his young son from speaking with Carlos Alcaraz at Wimbledon.

The veteran Italian will play Alcaraz in what could be his final Wimbledon appearance.

His entire family have flown to London this week to watch the match.

“Obviously, with these guys, there's little to think about,” Fognini told AS, reacting to the draw. “Two days ago, when the draw came out, my son called me and said, 'Dad, see, you're playing against Carlitos'. And I said, 'Yes, do you want to come?'.

""[He said] 'Yes, yes, yes, I'm coming, I'm coming'. And [my wife] Flavia, also with the little girl, is coming to watch the game. Now, when [my eldest son] saw him, I told him, 'Don't say hello to him, because he's my opponent tomorrow', and he got angry.”



Reigning men's champion Carlos Alcaraz has revealed that he has linked up with Andy Murray for a game of golf. Murray, who won the Wimbledon title on two occasions in his career, worked as Novak Djokovic's coach for a spell at the start of the year but ultimately left the veteran's team.

When asked about how he prepares for Grand Slam tournaments ahead of Wimbledon, the Spaniard said: “I play some golf. Actually, I play with Andy Murray on Monday and a few more players.”

He added: “Just went to the centre a little bit. Just wanted to go to the centre a little bit, walk around, have good food, and just having quality time with them doing some stuff that probably I wouldn't be able to do it while the tournament is on.”



Wimbledon chiefs will implement a rare rule due to the sizzling temperatures at the All England Club.

The rule, which will come into force if temperatures go beyond 30.1 degrees Celsius, will allow a 10-minute pause between the third and fourth set of men's matches, or between sets two and three of women's matches.

And outlining the new heat regulations, Wimbledon referee Denise Parnell said: “The heat rule will apply to all singles events at the qualifying and main draw for The Championships 2025.

“It applies to all matches including those which have already started. Only one of the players participating in the match needs to request the break for the rule to be implemented.”

Emma Raducanu has talked down her chances of success at Wimbledon after admitting she received some “pretty bad news” in the lead up to the tournament.

The 22-year-old Briton explained in her pre-tournament press conference: “Truthfully, I don't expect much from myself this year. I know I've just been dealing with certain things. I just want to go out there and embrace the moment. I want to embrace the occasion.

“I know there's not many opportunities to be playing at Wimbledon. You get it once a year and for a finite amount of time. I'm just looking forward to going out there and feeling the surroundings and the atmosphere.”

Good morning and welcome to the Express Sport live Wimbledon blog on day one of The Championships.

It's set to be a scorcher at the All England Club today, with some of the best tennis players in the world in action a little later. So grab a coffee and stick with us throughout the day for live updates.

...

LONDON (AP) — Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova waved goodbye to her favorite Grand Slam tournament Tuesday.

The 35-year-old Czech player, who won at the All England Club in 2011 and 2014, plans to leave the tour after the U.S. Open, which ends in September.

Her Wimbledon farewell was a 6-3, 6-1 loss to 10th-seeded Emma Navarro of the United States on No. 1 Court.

“This place holds the best memories I could wish for,” an emotional Kvitova said in an on-court interview that is usually granted to the match winner. ""I never dreamed of winning a Wimbledon and I won it twice. This is something very special.

“I will miss Wimbledon for sure,” she continued. “I will miss tennis, I will miss you fans. But I'm ready for the next chapter in life as well, and I can't wait to be back as a member.”

Kvitova, who accepted a wild-card invitation, missed last year's tournament while on maternity leave.

The 24-year-old Navarro said Kvitova has been “an incredible player and obviously won this tournament twice, and then had a kid and came back, which is definitely an inspiring story from her end.”

In 2011, Kvitova beat Maria Sharapova 6-3, 6-4 in the final. Three years later, Kvitova earned her second trophy, defeating Eugenie Bouchard 6-3, 6-0 in the title match.

“I think it's the best tournament in the world,"" she said.

The U.S. Open, she assures, will be her last one.

“I am sure,” Kvitova said, noting it's not just the toll on her body. ""The motivation, it's different than it was before.""

After dropping the first two sets, Taylor Fritz rallies to win the fifth set 6-4 against France's Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard and advance to the second round at Wimbledon. (0:43)

WIMBLEDON, England -- After dealing with his opponent's 153 mph serve -- the fastest in Wimbledon history -- and an overnight postponement, American Taylor Fritz returned Tuesday to win the fifth set and finish off a 6-7 (6), 6-7 (8), 6-4, 7-6 (6), 6-4 first-round win over Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.

Not only did Fritz, the 2024 US Open runner-up, need to turn things around after dropping the opening two sets, but he was two points from defeat on a half-dozen occasions in the fourth-set tiebreaker Monday night.

""A really crazy match,"" the No. 5-seeded Fritz said Tuesday after wrapping up the victory at No. 1 Court. ""I thought it was about to be all over last night in the fourth-set tiebreaker. But he came back on me in the first two tiebreakers, so I thought maybe I had one in me. I'm super happy to get through it.""

A player who wasn't so happy after returning to complete his postponed match from Monday night was third-seeded Alexander Zverev, who became the highest men's seed to fall after losing to France's Arthur Rinderknech in a five-set marathon, 7-6 (3), 6-7 (8), 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-4.

After Fritz forced the fifth set Monday at about 10:15 p.m., the match was suspended because there is a curfew at the All England Club that halts play at 11 p.m., and officials were concerned about finishing by that time.

It was clear Fritz preferred to continue, but it wasn't up to him.

""I mean, it's obviously not ideal,"" the 27-year-old Californian said Tuesday. ""I felt like if we weren't going to have time to finish the fifth set, then absolutely I think it makes sense not to play the fifth set. But we were having sets about as long as you can possibly play sets, and they were still in the time frame that we had last night to play the fifth.

""I obviously wanted to play it, but either way, I felt confident coming back today (and) getting it done, as well.""

As it turned out, he needed only 35 minutes Tuesday to get the job done in a contest that featured 66 total aces -- 37 by Mpetshi Perricard, 29 by Fritz.

On the third point of the match Monday, Mpetshi Perricard -- a 6-foot-8 Frenchman who is 21 -- smacked a serve at 153 mph, eclipsing the old tournament best of 148 mph by Taylor Dent in 2010.

Fritz lost in the first round at the French Open last month, but he is far more comfortable on slick, speedy grass courts, which reward the power on his big serve and forehand. He reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon in 2022 and last year, and he is coming off his fourth Eastbourne Open title on the surface last week.

""This is a huge, huge week for me, with the recent results on grass. So I was thinking about that in this match,"" he said. ""It put a lot of pressure on me, because I really didn't want to go out in the first round.""

Zverev, meanwhile, was tied with the 72nd-ranked Rinderknech at a set apiece when play was stopped Monday night on Centre Court. The Russian, however, suffered his first opening round defeat at a Grand Slam since Wimbledon in 2019 and is still searching for a first major after 38 attempts.

In the buildup to the tournament, Rinderknech reached the quarterfinals at Queen's Club, where he beat Ben Shelton and Reilly Opelka. He will next face Chile's Cristian Garin in the second round.

Zverev has reached the fourth round at Wimbledon three times, including last year, but never beyond that point. He lost to Fritz in five sets a year ago.

In other matches Tuesday, top-ranked Jannik Sinner got his Wimbledon campaign off to an ideal start by beating Luca Nardi 6-4, 6-3, 6-0 in an all-Italian matchup.

The three-time Grand Slam champion, who lost a five-set French Open final to Carlos Alcaraz, is in search of his first Wimbledon title. He was a semifinalist at the All England Club in 2023.

""First matches are never easy, so I'm very happy about my performance,"" he said in his on-court interview. ""It's a new tournament, new chances, new challenges. You have one opponent at a time.""

Sinner will play Aleksandar Vukic of Australia in the second round.

Britain's Jack Draper, the No. 4 seed, moved into the second round after his opponent, Sebastian Baez, retired with an injury after losing the first two sets and falling behind 2-1 in the third.

""I wanted to play a bit longer in all honesty,"" Draper said after the 74-minute match. ""It is no way to win like that, and I wish Sebastian the best in his recovery.""

American Ben Shelton, the 10th seed, dispatched Australian qualifier Alex Bolt after a workmanlike 6-4, 7-6 (1), 7-6 (4) victory.

Tommy Paul, the No. 13 seed fro the United States, took out Britain's Johannus Monday with little fuss, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2, but it was the end of the road for compatriot Alex Michelsen, seeded 30th, after a 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (6) loss to Serbia's Miomir Kecmanovic.

Italy's Lorenzo Musetti, who reached the semifinals here last year, was upset by Georgian qualifier Nikoloz Basilashvili 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 on Court Two.

Alexander Bublik, seeded 28th, was also unable to avoid the exodus of seeded men's players as he lost to Spaniard Jaume Munar 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-2.

Arthur Rinderknech earned his first Top 5 win on Tuesday at Wimbledon, where he stunned third seed Alexander Zverev in five sets to reach the second round.

The Frenchman and German were locked at one-set-all when play was suspended on Monday night due to the 11 p.m. Wimbledon curfew. When play resumed on Tuesday with the roof open, Rinderknech came out firing to reel off the third set before he recovered from squandering a 5/3 lead in the fourth-set tie-break to eventually earn a 7-6(3), 6-7(8), 6-3, 6-7(5), 6-4 win in four hours and 44 minutes.

Rinderknech sealed victory on his third match point when he fired a backhand winner — one of the 79 winners he hit in the match — crosscourt. The World No. 72 collapsed to the ground and then returned to his feet to embrace the roars from the Centre Court Crowd.

“I don't even know where to start. My legs are still shaking. I'm just happy that the match is finished,” said Rinderknech. “It's very difficult, this sport… But what a moment, such emotion.

“You can't really be in control when you play someone like Sascha Zverev, the World No. 3. He has been at the top for so many years. It's my first Top 5 win, and in the biggest stadium in the world.”

Upset accomplished 🎯Rinderknech takes out third seed Zverev 7-6(3) 6-7 6-3 6-7 6-4… @wimbledon | #wimbledon pic.twitter.com/LQUpaSKb7o

Zverev entered the clash holding a 6-2 record on grass this year, reaching the title match in Stuttgart and the semi-finals in Halle. Yet he was unable to move Rinderknech enough in the majority of the baseline exchanges.

The 29-year-old Rinderknech, who upset World No. 10 Ben Shelton at The Queen's Club earlier this month, outlasted Zverev in the rallies and was sharp when moving forward, pressurising the German with his clean net play.

Rinderknech, who won 80 per cent (44/55) of his net points, will try to reach the third round at Wimbledon for the first time when he meets Cristian Garin in the second round.

Zverev's wait for a first major title goes on. The German is the fourth Top 10 player to fall at this year's Championships, joining Lorenzo Musetti, Holger Rune and Daniil Medvedev.



On No. 1 Court, Taylor Fritz completed his comeback against big-serving Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard to survive in five.

Like Rinderknech's match with Zverev, play was suspended on Monday night due to the Wimbledon curfew with the scores level at 6-7(6), 6-7(8), 6-4, 7-6(6). Fritz had rallied from 1/5 in the fourth-set tie-break to force a decider and with the roof open used that momentum on Tuesday to triumph in the final set 6-4.

The fifth-seeded American, who is now 13-11 in fifth sets, arrived in London on Saturday night after winning his fourth Eastbourne title. Fritz will try to earn his 10th win of the grass-court season against ‘s-Hertogenbosch champion Gabriel Diallo on Wednesday.

Katerina Siniakova knows how to play on grass, and it showed as she came back from a set down and a medical timeout to take out No. 5 seed Zheng Qinwen on a hot Wimbledon afternoon.

WIMBLEDON -- There's something about grass that agrees with Katerina Siniakova.

The 29-year-old from the Czech Republic owns a winning record in singles at the All England Club, and she's won the doubles title twice, most recently last year with Taylor Townsend. Her last singles crown came two years ago on the lawns of Bad Homburg.

On Tuesday, Siniakova added another substantial item to her resume on the green stuff, upsetting No. 5 seed Zheng Qinwen 7-5, 4-6, 6-1 to advance to Wednesday's second-round match against unseeded Naomi Osaka. The Court 3 battle consumed 2 hours and 25 minutes on another blistering day.

It was the second Top 5 upset in a matter of hours, following No. 3 Jessica Pegula's 6-2, 6-3 loss to Elisabetta Cocciaretto.

In four appearances at Wimbledon, the 22-year-old from China has produced only two wins.

“I think maybe it's me,” Zheng said later. “I should do better in my service game. I give her a lot, especially I was leading 5-3 in the first set. At that moment, my concentration were not there. Was a pity.

“Also in the third set I gave her so easy away my service game. That's the key on grass.”

Zheng was in good position to win the first set, leading 5-3, but Siniakova broke her usually solid serve twice and ran away with the final four games.

The second set was deadlocked at 4-all when Zhen completed a critical break with a lovely backhand overhead winner and served it out.

Siniakova, despite taking a medical timeout on the second set and at times looking affected by the heat, came out fast in the third, breaking Zheng to take a 2-0 lead, a margin that eventually ballooned to 5-0.

Continually harassing Zheng's serve, Siniakova forced 15 break-point opportunities and converted five of them.

A week after making her first career grass-court WTA final, Iga Swiatek kicked off her 2025 Wimbledon campaign with a straight-sets victory over Polina Kudermetova.

WIMBLEDON -- A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, Iga Swiatek was the best junior here on the grass.

“It feels like it was in a different lifetime, you know?” Swiatek told reporters on Sunday. “It was probably the highlight of my career back then. It felt pretty surreal. But on the other hand, I came back home, and nothing really changed.

“I remember I thought maybe life is going to be, like, perfect now. I was a bit disappointed. It was still the same, and I still had to get back to work. I remember having a lot of just hope and just the feeling that maybe it's going to be also possible in the future at the pro level.”

Wimbledon: Scores | Order of play | Draws

It was 2018 and the 17-year-old Swiatek won her first (and only) junior Grand Slam title on a surface that is technically her worst as a professional.

That draw was loaded with future stars -- No. 3 seed Coco Gauff, No. 8 Clara Tauson and No. 11 Leylah Fernandez. Swiatek beat unseeded Emma Raducanu 6-0, 6-1 in the quarterfinals and No. 4 seed Wang Xinyu in the semis.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Fast forward to today, with Swiatek -- a four-time Roland Garros champion on the red clay but with a career-best quarterfinal berth at Wimbledon two years ago -- coming off her best Hologic WTA Tour grass result ever. Last Saturday's final in Bad Homburg was her first WTA final since winning in Paris more than a year ago.

On Tuesday, the No. 8 seed here dropped a 7-5, 6-1 decision on Polina Kudermetova. It was Swiatek's 61st consecutive win in an opening match -- the longest streak of any woman this century. She'll meet Caty McNally, a 6-3, 6-1 winner over British wildcard Jodie Burrage on Thursday.

With the victory, Swiatek's record at Wimbledon is 12-5 (.706). That's a fairly stellar mark, but perhaps because she is so dominant on clay, Swiatek has always been self-deprecating about her grass skills.

And yet, the 24-year-old from Poland defeated Jasmine Paolini definitively, 6-1, 6-3, in the Bad Homburg semifinals.

“It for sure gave me a lot of confidence,” Swiatek said. “Obviously it's tennis, so every day is different, but I felt like I'm playing great. I really pushed Jasmine the way I wanted to. I had really great time in Bad Homburg and enjoyed it. Yeah, also having more time to practice before on grass really helped. I feel that I have a little bit more skills.”

And while Paolini reached the finals here a year ago, she is not listed among the leading favorites to win this title. Swiatek, a small distance behind Aryna Sabalenka, is -- ahead of 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina and reigning French Open winner Coco Gauff.

Swiatek gave Jessica Pegula a good go in Bad Homburg, losing a brisk final by a 6-4, 7-5 count.

“She said in her speech, `Oh, there's hope for me.' I was like, `You're still pretty good,' ” Pegula said on Sunday. “I'm pretty sure she made [Wimbledon] quarters a few years ago. She won junior Wimbledon -- you're obviously not like a lost cause.

“I think she was a little hard on herself … it's hard when you don't feel as natural on a surface. Yeah, she'll be fine.”

A post shared by Iga Świątek (@iga.swiatek)

Swiatek arrived at Wimbledon late Saturday night and -- aside from her media responsibilities -- had Sunday off. She practiced Monday and looked sharp in her first match.

It's all a part of a committed effort to get better on grass. After losing to Sabalenka in the semifinals at Roland Garros, Swiatek opted to skip the WTA 500 events at Queen's Club and Berlin. Instead, she spent a week practicing in Mallorca. Slowly, surely, she's feeling better on grass.

“Just more time, like give me opportunity to, yeah, work on some movement and stepping to the ball a little bit differently than on clay -- it helped,” Swiatek said. “You really have to trust your shots on grass. You can't really pull back.

“Any shot that will give your opponent more time to go in is probably the shot that will make you lose the rally. I just went for it in Bad Homburg, and it really worked.”

There's a theory floating around that because her customary clay runs in Stuttgart, Madrid, Roma and Paris have been so taxing, there was never much left in Swiatek's tank, physically or emotionally, for Wimbledon.

After a work-vacation on a lovely Spanish island, she looks fresh and ready to challenge for one of the two Grand Slam titles that have eluded her.

Lawrence Barretto explains the state of play after Alpine enquired about the availability of 10-time race winner and current Mercedes reserve Valtteri Bottas.

Alpine have enquired about the availability of 10-time race winner and current Mercedes reserve Valtteri Bottas, should they decide they want to change their line-up this season or beyond. F1 Correspondent Lawrence Barretto explains the state of play...

Well, they're not so much chasing as they are exploring their options.

Alpine are in something of a transitional year – and with the Enstone-based team swapping to Mercedes power next year as part of an overhaul of the squad under the stewardship of Flavio Briatore, they are keen to get their driver line-up right for 2026.

Pierre Gasly is, without question, part of their plans. Their second seat is trickier.

They've already made a change this season, bringing in Franco Colapinto to replace Jack Doohan (with the latter back to reserve and the bench) from Imola onwards.

Colapinto hasn't hit the ground running like he did in his super sub performance for Williams and has yet to score a point in five races with the squad.

However, it must be said that the car has lacked performance relative to its rivals and, since Colapinto joined the team, his team mate Gasly has scored just once with eighth in Spain.

Alpine continue to back Colapinto – and believe he is capable of delivering.

But as 2026 edges ever closer, Briatore is doing what you'd expect him to do – keeping his finger on the pulse and ensuring he knows what his options are going forward, hence why sources say he contacted Mercedes to check on Bottas' availability.

My understanding is that Mercedes will not stand in Bottas' way should he be offered a race seat elsewhere.

I believe Bottas is contracted to the Silver Arrows, where he won all of his 10 races, until the end of the year – and then he is free to make his own decisions with regards trying to find a race seat (or worst-case alternative role) next season.

His boss Toto Wolff is a big supporter of Bottas and believes he is still operating at a high-level and is deserving of a place on the grid. So, it's no surprise they would accommodate a request should one be made for his services, especially as Alpine will be running the Silver Arrows' engines next year.

It's two-fold. Briatore finds the team's currently level of performance concerning. With Alpine locked to the bottom of the Constructors' Championship, he wants short-term progress soon.

Having two strong drivers delivering consistently can have a significant impact – as Williams are seeing with their experienced line-up of Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz.

Secondly, he wants the team to take advantage of sweeping changes to the aerodynamic and power unit regulations next season – and the arrival of Mercedes power, which is widely expected to be among the best, if not the best, engines next year.

Bringing on someone with Bottas' experience could help on both counts.

Teams' standings after Austria

The Finn has 247 Grands Prix to his name, has won 10 races, scored 67 podiums and taken 20 pole positions. He excelled during his time at Mercedes, particularly with regards to his one-lap pace, and made a positive impact during his three years at Sauber.

His time at Mercedes has given him recent insight into how a race-winning team is operating while he is believed to have been fully plugged into the development of the 2026 car. He even had some seat time with McLaren earlier this year in a 2023-spec car.

Alpine could benefit from Bottas' presence in the race team – and there will be those internally who are fans of his given he was in contention for a seat there this year before the management changed and opted for Doohan.

One thing is for sure, Bottas is hungry to return to a race seat and more motivated than ever.

He took the Mercedes reserve role (to stay relevant, fit and connected to the sport) and is keen on discussions with newcomers Cadillac about a race seat next year.

The Finn would back himself to deliver if he gets a shot at Alpine – and you'd expect he'd be interested in a deal that allows him to drive next year, too, for security. His experience with Mercedes power could be invaluable.

Such a move would help him get race sharp again so that even if Alpine don't retain him, he would be even more appealing to the likes of Cadillac, as they look to hit the ground running on debut next year.

For now, it's business as usual and Colapinto will be in the car at Silverstone and beyond.

If Alpine decide they want to pursue an alternative, preliminary talks with Mercedes would likely continue, with Bottas and his management also being drafted in if things accelerate.

Absolutely, but every driver is under pressure to perform – and Colapinto is no different.

Briatore's move to explore options will raise that pressure, but it might trigger a step up in performance for the Argentine driver.

Silverstone is a circuit which the 22-year-old has performed well at in junior formulae – and he'll have fond memories of the place having made his Grand Prix weekend debut there last year when driving for Williams.

If Colapinto improves his results, Briatore won't need to change anything for now. And just knowing Bottas is available gives Briatore and Alpine flexibility.

""The response to 'Prens' just shows how strong the demand for high-quality, locally produced originals is and highlights Max as the home of this type of content,"" says top executive Deniz Şaşmaz Oflaz.

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	And the best-performing local original production, or LOP, for Warner Bros. Discovery‘s Max, soon-to-be-rebranded as HBO Max, globally is … drum roll, please … Turkish satire series The Prince (Prens).


	On Friday, the final episode of the third season of the hit series became available and seems to have helped seal the deal, according to company data. 




	Starring Giray Altınok as the Prince, the show is “set in the imaginary kingdom of Bongomia and follows the comedic adventures of the prince, a very unpopular member of the kingdom whose own family didn't even bother to give him a name,” according to a synopsis.

	Over the past month, the Turkish Max original achieved “the highest level of engagement of any Max local original production globally,” with 74 percent of subscribers in the country tuning in to it, according to WBD.


	Over the same period, The Prince proved to be a key driver for new subscribers, becoming “the first show that almost three in four (73 percent) of new Max users watched — the highest nominal acquisition volume for a local original production” in a country in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, company data shows.


	During its finale week, season three of The Prince accounted for 72 percent of all viewing on Max in Türkiye, WBD said, adding: “The final episode (season three episode eight), released just three days ago, became the most viewed episode of the week with 54 percent of total viewers already having watched the finale.”

	











WBD's transition of its streaming service BluTV to Max in Turkey became official in mid-April as the Hollywood giant underlined its “commitment to increasing its investment in local content” and “bringing a compelling slate of new local stories” to its streamer in the country.


	“The response to Prens just shows how strong the demand for high-quality, locally produced originals is and highlights Max as the home of this type of content,” Deniz Şaşmaz Oflaz, vp of local original productions, local channels and streaming operations lead for Türkiye, tells THR. “As one of our first original series since launching the platform direct-to-consumer in Türkiye earlier this year, it's exciting to see Prens playing a key role in attracting new viewers to the platform.”


	In a recent THR interview, she described the series this way: “It looks like a comedy, but it's more of a dramedy. … The lead character is the prince, who doesn't want to be on the throne and is not really that smart. And then we see all these typical things happening in this kingdom that we've been seeing in such series as Game of Thrones. So it's a satire.”

""We are for the dismantling of a violent military machine,"" the duo wrote on Instagram, days after chanting ""death to the IDF"" during their Glastonbury set over the weekend. 


							By 

	Ethan Millman


Music Editor


	English punk-rap duo Bob Vylan have issued a new statement following their controversial “death to the IDF” chants at Glastonbury over the weekend, denying claims of antisemitism while continuing to call for a free Palestine.


	“We are not for the death of Jews, Arabs, or any other race or group of people,” the duo wrote in a post on Instagram on Tuesday. “We are for the dismantling of a violent military machine — a machine whose own soldiers were told to use ‘unnecessary lethal force' against innocent civilians waiting for aid. A machine that has destroyed much of Gaza.”

	Bob Vylan garnered significant criticism over the “death to the IDF” chants during their set last weekend, with Glastonbury organizer Emily Eavis writing that their words “very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.”

UTA subsequently dropped Bob Vylan, and the U.S. State Department revoked their visas, putting their upcoming North American tour in jeopardy. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau wrote on X on Monday that “foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country.”


	The BBC also shared a statement saying the network regretted livestreaming Bob Vylan's Glastonbury set, further stating that “the antisemitic sentiments expressed by Bob Vylan were utterly unacceptable and have no place on our airwaves.”

	











	Of the backlash, Bob Vylan wrote on Tuesday that the duo “are not the story” and argued that they were “being targeted for speaking up,” further encouraging their fans to continue to speak out on the matter. 


	“We are a distraction from the story. And whatever sanctions we receive will be a distraction,” Bob Vylan said. “The government doesn't want us to ask why they remain silent in the face of this atrocity. To ask why they aren't doing more to stop the killing. To feed the starving. The more time they talk about Bob Vylan, the less time they spend answering for their criminal inaction.”

""That was the kick-starter to me being like, 'OK, Melissa, get your a-- in gear,'"" she said of Bey's show.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Lizzo recently went through a difficult time, but after attending one of Beyoncé‘s concerts, the Yitty founder realized that nothing can break her soul.


	In a candid conversation with Women's Health published Tuesday (July 1), Lizzo opened up about how seeing her idol perform kickstarted her healing journey after struggling for months with depression and isolation. The hitmaker attended the Renaissance Tour in 2023; that year, she was hit with an ongoing lawsuit from three former backup dancers accusing her of sexual harassment and toxic work conditions, all allegations Lizzo has vehemently denied.

	











	“I was so nervous,” she told the publication, noting she was worried that people in the crowd would “boo me or be like, ‘F–k you.'”




			Trending on Billboard		







	When fellow attendees instead embraced her with encouraging remarks, Lizzo says she was inspired to pull herself out of that dark period. “It made me feel like, ‘Wow, maybe I don't want to die. Life is worth living.' That was the kick-starter to me being like, ‘OK, Melissa, get your a– in gear and take your f–king life back.'”

	











	Lizzo has since embarked on a fitness and mental wellness journey, re-emerging stronger and more self-assured than ever ahead of the release of her upcoming album, Love in Real Life. But things were dark for quite some time, according to the musician, as the legal action against her made her question everything.


	“You look around and think about every person you've ever known and every experience, and you wonder, ‘Was that real?'” she told WH. “I got very paranoid and isolated. I used to walk into glam and be like, ‘Oh, let me tell you about this crazy s–t that happened last night!' I couldn't do that anymore. I pushed everyone away. I wasn't even talking to my therapist.”


	The backup dancers' lawsuit came in August 2023, with the plaintiffs accusing Lizzo of pressuring them to touch nude dancers at a club, commenting on their weight and private sex lives, and forcing her religious beliefs on them. Some of those claims were dismissed by a judge in 2024, but the lawsuit was still ordered to move forward; in June, however, Lizzo filed an appeal aimed at shutting it down for good on the grounds that the dancers' claims clashed with her First Amendment rights.


	In September 2023, Lizzo was hit with a second lawsuit, this time from a former member of her style team claiming she'd faced a “culture of racism and bullying” while working for the Grammy winner. Again, Lizzo denied any wrongdoing, with her attorneys calling the claims “meritless and salacious.”


	“It got to the point where I was like, ‘I could die,'” Lizzo recalled of the public backlash she faced in light of the lawsuits. “I never attempted to kill myself or thought about it, but I did think, ‘If everyone hates you and thinks you're a terrible person, then what's the point?'”

	











	Despite everything, the businesswoman knows she always has Bey. The Destiny's Child alum's discography is a go-to for Lizzo during her workouts, and the “Truth Hurts” artist even got a personal shout-out from Bey on many nights of the Renaissance Tour during “Break My Soul (The Queens Remix)” — something that made Lizzo cry when she witnessed it in person.


	“In that moment I was thinking about baby me, listening to Happy Face by destiny's child and crying myself to sleep because of bullies,” she wrote on Instagram shortly afterward. “It's an honor. Thank You @beyonce.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The Bear's Ayo Edebiri gives the performance of her career in ""Sophie""","https://www.avclub.com/the-bear-recap-season-4-episode-6-sophie","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

[Editor's note: The recap of episode seven publishes July 2. This recap contains spoilers.]    

There are a lot of ways to measure time: how many seconds to prep an appetizer, how many days until Tiff's wedding, how many years since Carmy last saw his mother, how many heartbeats Syd's father has left. As Tina tells Marcus, “There's always a clock.”

Sydney rushes into the hospital, every other sound drowned out by the steady beeping of a heart monitor. Like everything in her life, she thinks she needs to face her dad's heart attack alone, because that's what adults do, right? But sometimes you get what you need—in this case, Claire Bear.

When no one buys Carmy's vague explanation for why Syd left in a hurry, he tells them the truth. Everyone reacts in a regular human way except Richie, who calls Carm a sociopath for not wanting to send a gift basket. Timing as terrible as ever, Neil tells Sugar that he scored Francie an invite to Tiff and Frank's wedding. We still have no idea what went down between them, but if Natalie's shouting and weeping is any indication, it was real, real bad. 

This wedding is gearing up to be a shitshow of monumental proportions. On top of the Richie/Frank and Sugar/Francie stuff, Donna and Claire are both coming. Carmy promises that his ex isn't the reason he's skipping the big day—it's his tornado of a mother, whom he hasn't seen in years. Marcus and the Faks are old hat at standing on the sidelines while the Berzatto clan volley insults across the kitchen; but Luca, Jessica, and baby Sophie watch the madness unfold like “What in the name of Chef Terry have we gotten ourselves into?”

Jessica approaches Richie in the dining room to talk about the bear. No, not the restaurant or the “narcissist bitch” in the kitchen—the giant teddy bear Frank bought for Eva. Jess' wisdom is spot-on: Frank bought Eva an extravagant gift because he's insecure about the fact that she'll always love her real dad more. Richie tells her it still makes him feel so alone, but Jessica says he's got help. (Every guest is family.) In the kitchen, Tina and Marcus have a heart-to-heart about Syd's dad and the existential dread of realizing your parents are mortal: When something happens to them, no matter what kind of relationship you have, time resets.

Fortunately, Emmanuel Adamu's clock hasn't run out just yet. Only when she knows he's out of the woods does Sydney let herself cry, and Ayo Edebiri delivers the performance of her career. Stuttering through big, messy tears, she tells Claire that she'd always assumed her dad would be around. And she hates that she's such a screwup, that she needs him so much, that he has to spend so much time worrying about her. It's an open wound of a monologue that reminds us just how young Syd is; she's so good at projecting cool confidence that it's easy to forget.

Claire, somehow wiser than Tina and Jessica combined, assures Sydney that it makes Emmanuel happy to worry about his daughter: “Worrying about people and having people worry about us is, like, everything we've got.”

After telling Carmy the good news, Syd arrives at Emmanuel's bedside blurting out apologies and promising to move back home. He doesn't want that; he wants her to spread her wings. The look in his eyes when he kisses his daughter on the forehead could mean a thousand things.

With the fires doused (for now), Nat tells Carmy that she wants him to stop hiding from everything. She does it, too, and it reminds him that they grew up stewing in the same trauma. He promises to set his fear aside and go to the wedding, because he's learning that not everything is about him. The world falls away when Sugar passes over the baby. Carm has no idea how to hold her, but his chef's hands know what it means to handle something delicate. Maybe he doesn't break everything after all.

Richie is literally banging his head against a table when Neil tells him that they've zeroed in on the critic from Food & Wine, and he's got a reservation for tonight. Finally, progress. When he sees Carmy holding Sophie through the kitchen window, Richie's heart grows three sizes. But truly, what human being with a soul could watch Jeremy Allen White cradle a tiny baby in his big, strong arms and not melt?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Squid Game's final competition is a dark, funny stab at the democratic process","https://www.avclub.com/squid-game-recap-season-3-episode-5","Tue, 01 Jul 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

[Editor's note: The recap of Squid Game‘s finale publishes July 2.]   

Someone once wrote—and I'm paraphrasing here—that Squid Game history arrives twice: first as tragedy and then as farce. The first Squid Game (the actual wrestling match, not the TV series surrounding it) was an ugly, brutal finale to the 2021 contest: two old friends, dressed in fancy suits by puppetmasters looking to mock them, slowly beating each other to death in the driving rain. “Sky Squid Game,” its 2024 successor, is the blackest of black comedies imaginable: a bunch of men voting, loudly praising democracy, and murmuring their agreement on the reasonableness of tossing a baby off a cliff. 

In my recap of “222,” I worried that this embrace of the show's more satiric elements would have negative impacts on its human storytelling. Situations can be absurd—this show thrives on creating them—but things get trickier when that absurdity invades the human mind. Credit where it's due, then, because “Circle Triangle Square,” the show's penultimate installment, defied my concerns and threaded the needle between realism and satire with surprising grace. It's goofy, yes, as each member of the O crew “spontaneously” puts forth a “reasonable” argument for why their fellow players should offer themselves up to die. (Song Yong-chang, who's been doing great work throughout these two seasons as old bastard Im Jeong-dae, is genuinely hilarious here, pivoting shamelessly every time the situation shifts.) But by focusing in on the desperation of the moment—and especially the ways it impacts Myung-gi, who's fiendishly playing angles at every point—the show keeps hold of the human element. Playing out as a series of discrete confrontations across the first two (of three) towers of the deadly “court,” the episode moves from peak to peak with series-high intensity.

Of course, we only get to said peaks because Seong Gi-hun ultimately decides he's not going to murder his and the baby's way to victory, a notion dispensed of in an especially strong cold open that sketches in at least part of why Front Man Hwang In-ho Is The Way He Is. Turns out, back in 2015, when he was just a player, In-ho was given the exact same option (and knife) that Gi-hun has been given now: Faced with certain death (and goaded to action by game founder/original 001 player Oh Il-nam), he plunged that blade into the necks of a bunch of sleeping people who would have killed him first, making him the winner of his version of the games by default. Lee Byung-hun has been a fantastic performer pretty much every time we've gotten him out of his Dollar Store Darth Vader mask throughout the show's run—it's one of the big things I've missed in the transition from Squid Game 2 to Squid Game 3—but he's absolutely spellbinding here: first as the clearly traumatized In-ho in the flashback and then as his modern incarnation, watching with silent…something…as Gi-hun (pulled back from murder at the last minute by his memories of Sae-byeok) finally proves himself the better man.

And while I'm on the topic, this is probably as good a time as any to tackle all the other stuff “Circle Triangle Square” gets up to that's not the game itself: No-eul's final confrontation with The Officer, as well as the exciting culmination of Boat Adventures 2: Boat Harder. There is at least something to No-eul's (very long) fight with her former middle-manager, who apparently bonded with her over leaving people behind in North Korea. (In his case, it was apparently due to a lack of transplantable organs, so that's that character beat/criminal smuggling ring explained.) Taking place in In-ho's office (because that's where he keeps paper copies of the amusingly named Squid Archives), this sequence goes on for a long time, but ultimately never develops much beyond “woman forced to abandon her child betrays evil organization to save other child, man gets mad about it.” He gets the drop on her, she gets the drop on him, she gets stabbed, he gets shot, nobody threatens to throw a baby off of anything, and it's all kind of a wash. No-eul survives, gets rid of the hard copy of 246's records and another couple of things get ticked off the show's plot checklist. (The boat stuff, meanwhile, is even more slight: 246 gets into a running gunfight with some Pink Guards and is saved when Jun-ho and The Other Guy Who's With Jun-ho come across him in their boat. Truly, it's a joyous confluence of maritime coincidences. It's a shame we couldn't get some shots of Choi floating somewhere out in a dinghy, too.)

I'm continually dismissive of this material, not because No-eul and Jun-ho aren't decent enough characters—although they both tend to be pretty flat in practice. But A.) traditional action sequences aren't Squid Game's strong suit, as the season-two finale pretty ably demonstrated. And B.) these bits contribute nothing to the show's over-arcing themes. Jun-ho just really wants to find his brother; No-eul just really wants to save some guy she knows from work. There's not much more to their stories than that. At no point, during either of these plotlines, do I feel like I'm getting much insight into how the games work or how they're meant to reflect on society. It's just…Plot Stuff.

Anyway, back in the actual TV show: The nine surviving players are introduced to the rules of Sky Squid Game, and they're simple and brutal. Standing on top of lethally high towers, they'll have fifteen minutes to push at least one (living) member of their group off, allowing the survivors to move to the next edifice. Successfully complete the task three times within each individual time limit, and the survivors walk away with their prize. Otherwise, well…you know.

Jeong-dae and his crew think they have the game already solved coming in: push off Min-su, Gi-hun, and the baby, and walk out as multi-billionaires. But their pronouncements about “fairness” and the “democratic” process keep running, hard, into the practicalities of murder in ways that give “Square Triangle Circle” a queasy tension it might have otherwise lacked. How, for instance, do you get the baby away from Gi-hun, so that each can be killed in a one-per-tower fashion? (Screw it up and kill them both at once, and one of Jeong-dae's six is going to have to tumble down to fulfill the win condition for the final bout.) And once a target has been safely picked, how do you actually get them off the ledge without going over yourself? It's all well and good to try speaking calmly about how the electorate has decided you, specifically, need to smash into the ground and explode for the good of the group—but try telling that to a man on the brink.

None of this psychological math is made easier by Myung-gi, who's secretly running his own program separate from everybody else. Sure, he's the one who ultimately pushes poor, addled Min-su to his death, using a “safety” pole at the center of the tower to prod him over the edge and finish the first round with just a few seconds left on the clock. But he's also desperate to save his child, first attempting to engineer a complicated con to get the kid off of Gi-hun and then, when that fails due to that still-in-play knife, seizing a moment of distraction to shove one of the attackers to his death in Gi-hun's place. It all nearly works, as the surviving Os immediately identify the path of least resistance/stabbings and swiftly turn on one of their own to be a “lunch box,” beating him mercilessly so that they can throw him off the ledge as soon as the Circle tower's game has started. But, wouldn't you know it, Gi-hun's altruism just won't bite: His insistence on actual fairness, with the surviving six adults drawing lots to see who dies last, kicks off a final fight that depletes the supply of available victims quickly. And it's here, as with Hide And Seek, that Myung-gi's blend of pragmatism and greed fucks everybody: Sensing a chance to punish an asshole and bulk up the final pot, he shoves a defenseless Jeong-dae to his death. It's all well and good, since they've still got the “lunch box” to toss…until the doomed man gets his posthumous revenge by throwing himself off the tower preemptively. Now it's just two men and a baby, as we go out on Myung-gi and Gi-hun staring each other down, and the circle tower still demanding one final death. 

Whew! It's a lot to parse, especially because there's not room here to chart out every single shift of alliance, authority, pragmatism, and self-serving rhetoric that goes down on those two towers. The aggregate, though, is a pleasant whiplash between dark comedy and just pure darkness, with men trying to find the right combination of lofty words that will make a noble act out of the cowardly murders they're trying to commit. Watching Myung-gi maneuver, and the cracks form in Jeong-dae's supposedly solid alliance, is a pure distillation of all the ugly things Squid Game has had to say about capitalist democracy ever since the voting concept was introduced. The result isn't as draining as “The Starry Night,” because it would be hard for anything to match that particular ordeal. But it's a fascinating final game, and it makes “Circle Triangle Square” one of the strongest episodes of the season (at least, of course, when it focuses on the parts of this show that actually matter).

Jennifer Aniston will expand her Apple TV+ empire with an adaptation of Jennette McCurdy‘s memoir “I'm Glad My Mom Died.” 

Aniston, currently at Apple TV+ with “The Morning Show,” will star in and executive produce a 10-episode series inspired by the memoir, with McCurdy as the co-showrunner.

Former Nickelodeon child actress McCurdy starred in “Sam and Cat” opposite Ariana Grande, as well as “iCarly,” among other series. Her 2022 book became a bestseller and detailed the abuse she endured at the hands of her mother, Debbie, who died in 2013 of cancer. McCurdy also alleged that a Nickelodeon “creator” (believed to be Dan Schneider, who was later at the center of docuseries “Quiet on Set”) frequently supplied children with alcohol and requested massages from child actors. McCurdy claimed that she was offered $300,000 in “hush money” to not come forward about the abuse; she declined the payment.

The Apple TV+ adaptation hails from a who's who of acclaimed creators: Along with McCurdy, Ari Katcher (“Ramy,” “Jerrod Carmichael Reality Show”) will also showrun, write, and executive produce. Sharon Horgan's (“Bad Sisters”) Merman banner, Margot Robbie's LuckyChap productions, Jerrod Carmichael, and Erica Kay will also executive produce.

McCurdy previously told Vanity Fair in 2022 that she hopes to change how the press and public perceive child stars. “There's such a gross fascination and deep intrigue in child stars and the evolution of their careers and personal lives,” she said. “I don't know what that is, but I wish I could ask everybody on the outside, ‘What's going on here? Is everyone OK? Why is everybody obsessed with child stars? Does everybody need some therapy?' Yes, is the answer.”

As for the controversial title of her book (and now the series), McCurdy added, “I stand by the title and I believe in it. It was a tough thing for me to come to terms with. And the things that are difficult to come to terms with are often the things that need to be said the most.”

Aniston's “The Morning Show,” meanwhile, returns to Apple TV+ with Season 4 on September 17.

Brian Cox has become an icon in the U.S. thanks in part to roles in “Succession” and “X-Men,” but the acclaimed Scottish actor is revealing just how much he decided to pivot his career when he relocated to the States.

Cox said during a discussion with Issac Butler for the Criterion Channel's “The Craft of Acting” series (in the below video) that he  made the decision to pursue supporting roles after getting his start on the West End in theater. After breaking out in the U.S., he proudly embraced being a character actor instead of a leading man. 

 










“I came to that decision much later because I had been a leading actor [in England]. I'd done a lot of theater, a lot of television, stuff like that. But when I decided to come here, I just didn't want to go that route,” Cox said. “I came here in the '70s. I remember going to Hollywood […] and I really didn't like it. It really gave me the creeps, actually. I thought, ‘Well, I got that out of my system, right?' But, I still wanted to do movies, and I wanted to do American movies because that was my inspiration when I was a child. So what happened was that I decided to become a character actor.”

Cox cited how he was inspired by late supporting actors from the Golden Age of cinema to bring gravitas to each role, regardless of how many scenes his character appeared in. 

“I'm so influenced by people like William Deist and William Bendix and all those supporting actors of the '30s and '40s and what they did. I mean, they were the boosters of those films. Without them, there would be nothing, you know?” Cox said. “I thought, ‘That's my job. That's what I'll do. I'll be happy to do that.' Also, the challenge of giving an arc to a part, which is really difficult when you've only got three scenes and then there doesn't seem to be a connection [between them]. There is an inner connection; it's never the outer connection. That's why I decided to be a character actor.” 

And it turned out to be a career-making decision: Cox has won two Olivier Awards, an Emmy, and a Golden Globe across his storied career. Cox has also lamented the current state of Hollywood today in recent years, saying in 2024 that TV has replaced films as the best mode of creativity for actors. 

“What's happened is that television is doing what cinema used to do,” Cox said. “I think cinema is in a very bad way. I think it's lost its place because of, partly, the grandiose element between Marvel, DC and all of that. And I think it's beginning to implode, actually. You're kind of losing the plot.”

Hader's first project since wrapping his acclaimed HBO series in 2023 is the animated adaptation of Dr. Seuss' “The Cat in the Hat.” Hader stars as the titular character who “takes on his toughest assignment yet for the I.I.I.I.

Xochitl Gomez, Matt Berry, Quinta Brunson, Paula Pell, Tiago Martinez, Giancarlo Esposito, America Ferrera, Bowen Yang, and Tituss Burgess co-star in the animated film. 

Alessandro Carloni and Erica Rivinoja co-write and co-direct “The Cat in the Hat.” Earlier this year, Carloni said during a Work in Progression session at Annecy, via Deadline, that WBD's 2023 shelving of “Coyote vs. Acme” was sadly “representative of how painful and atrocious the industry can be,” especially for animated films. (“Coyote vs. Acme” was later sold to Ketchup Entertainment in 2025 and will receive a theatrical release next year.)

 










As for how their version of “The Cat in the Hat” will differ from other iterations, Carloni said they approached the source material with a fresh perspective. “We looked back at the book and wondered why the children become more confident by the end of the books,” Carloni said. “Deep down, is [the cat] the greatest child psychologist of all time? The greatest emotional support animal?”

In addition to “The Cat in the Hat,” actor Hader has another project in the works at Warner Bros. Hader is co-writing a series about the Jonestown cult massacre with “Damages” showrunner Daniel Zelman. Hader will serve as co-showrunner with Zelman and also executive produce, with Hader set to direct should the project move forward at HBO. A source told IndieWire that Hader could potentially star in the series as Jim Jones as well. 

“Saturday Night Live” alum Hader previously won two Emmys for Best Actor in a Comedy for “Barry.” The series itself garnered 16 total Emmy nominations for writer/director/creator Hader across its four seasons.

Warner Bros. Pictures will release “The Cat in the Hat” in theaters February 27, 2026. Check out the trailer below.

underscores are an anomaly in the chaos vortex of hyperpop. The 25-year-old April Harper Grey approaches albums with the plotting skills of a novelist; 2023's Wallsocket was themed after an imaginary Michigan town, for which she created a fake website complete with fictional mailing address, student newspaper, and “Moms of Wallsocket” discussion forum. Her songs overflow with hackneyed half-phrases and anachronisms that read like goofy proverbs. It can feel weird to even call her music “hyperpop”; its digital sheen is offset by an organic crunch, the raw bite of alt-rock riffs.

But when underscores unleashed “Music” at Knockdown Center hours before it dropped last week, it was clear that she's forever the kid who grew up tinkering on SoundCloud and worshipping Skrillex. “Last night, I had a wet dream about the perfect song,” she coos, while what sounds like a hydraulic hole puncher pummels away in the background. There's no shortage of glitzy pop pyrotechnics in these PB (post-BRAT) times, but the music of “Music” is endearingly askew, littered with little tonal jumps and ornate glitches. Grey turns abrasive percussion and 8-bit gurgles into the raw ingredients of desire. When I was growing up we had “Shawty's like a melody in my head”; now it's “When I'm with you, it feels like muu-sss-iiic” smeared against a rainbow of perfectly pixelated drops. This is for the people nursed on Monstercat, for collectors of Skullcandy headphones, for whom love in 2025 feels like a Syzy-ian EDM-trap eruption of noise.

	Senate Republicans have passed President Donald Trump's so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” a sprawling legislative package that is expected to kick millions off their health insurance, codify big tax cuts for the wealthy, give a massive funding boost to the administration's mass deportation efforts, and screw over the nation's poor with cuts to social services. 


	“This was an incredible victory for the American people,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) told reporters after the vote went final.


	The vote was 50-50, but Vice President J.D. Vance broke the tie. Republican Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) broke with their party and voted no on the legislation. Tillis announced earlier this week that he would not be seeking reelection after Trump said he would work to primary him amid his opposition to the bill.


	On Monday, Tillis bashed the legislation as a “bill will betray the promise Donald Trump made.”

	“I'm telling the president that you have been misinformed,” he said. “You supporting the Senate mark will hurt people who are eligible and qualified for Medicaid.”


	In a floor speech delivered over the weekend, Paul emphasized that his opposition to the bill stemmed from the predicted $4 trillion it would add to the national deficit over the next decade. “Maybe we have to judge the effects of the Big Not-So-Beautiful Bill by looking at what happens to the debt,” he said. “We're adding $2 trillion [to the debt ceiling] this year, but the authors of the bill are anticipating adding more than $2 trillion next year. That doesn't sound at all conservative to me and that's why I'm a ‘no.'”

	











	Trump celebrated the bill's passage on Truth Social, writing that the “biggest winner of all” is the American people, before pushing a series of false claims about the legislation, including that Medicaid is “not being cut.” The president called for the House to unite so that that he can sign the bill before the Fourth of July. “GET IT DONE!” he wrote.


	The bill will now be returned to the House of Representatives for passage with amendment, and then sent to the desk of President Donald Trump, who has demanded Congress pass his signature legislation by the Fourth of July. 


	In a statement issued on social media, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) wrote: “The House will work quickly to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill that enacts President Trump's full America First agenda by the Fourth of July.”

Whether you're a believer or skeptic, World UFO Day on July 2 is an occasion to ponder unexplained phenomena seen over the skies of Maryland over several decades.

World UFO Day 2025 commemorates the 78th anniversary of what became known as the “summer of the flying saucers.” It started with the first widely publicized U.S. sighting of an unidentified flying object by a civilian pilot searching the Cascade Mountains of Washington for a crashed military aircraft, followed by the crash of a mysterious object near Roswell, New Mexico, on July 2, 1947. 

Together, those incidents more or less made it safe for Americans to talk about strange occurrences in the sky. 

The National UFO Reporting Center takes thousands of reports a year from people who can't explain what they're seeing, whether a bright light, a peculiarly shaped object, or an aircraft that rapidly accelerates and decelerates just as quickly, seemingly exceeding current understanding of propulsion.

This year alone, 21 reports have been made about strange sightings in the skies over Maryland. Some examples:

On May 5 in Glen Burnie, some reported spotting a “VERY large object levitating upwards then completely vanishing in the sky.” 

Less than a month earlier in Berlin, another reported seeing “multiple shape-shifting, pulsating lights above (the) treeline at (a) campground” and capturing clips that showed “clear pulsing, color changes.” 

And on March 1, someone in Sykesville said they observed strobing lights flying east to west and then abruptly stopping and hovering. 

On June 24, 1947, civilian pilot Kenneth Arnold was flying near Mount Rainier, Washington, when he saw nine crescent-shaped objects flying in formation at about 10,000 feet at about a nearly impossible speed for the times of 1,200 to 1,700 mph.

It wasn't the first sighting of a UFO, but the public quickly became fascinated — and slightly terrified — after Arnold's sighting was reported worldwide. News coverage often included references to a “flying saucer,” a play on Arnold's statement that the object moved “like a saucer would if you skipped it over water.”

More reports followed during what became known as the “summer of the flying saucers,” including the Roswell incident. The Roswell Army Air Field announced in a July 8, 1947, news release that it had recovered the wreckage of a “flying disc” from W.W. “Mac” Brazel's ranch about 75 miles north of Roswell. 

The release was straightforward, noting:

“The many rumors regarding the flying disc became a reality yesterday when the intelligence office of the 509th Bomb Group of the Eighth Air Force, Roswell Army Air Field, was fortunate enough to gain possession of a disc through the cooperation of one of the local ranchers and the sheriff's office of Chaves County.

“The flying object landed on a ranch near Roswell sometime last week. Not having phone facilities, the rancher stored the disc until such time as he was able to contact the sheriff's office, who in turn notified Major Jesse A Marcel of the 509th Bomb Group Intelligence Office.

“Action was immediately taken and the disc was picked up at the rancher's home. It was inspected at the Roswell Army Air Field and subsequently loaned by Major Marcel to higher headquarters.”

The Roswell Army Air Field mentioned nothing in its press release about alien life, but people were already growing uneasy about what might be circling overhead. Brazel was among them. 

He thought the object he found on his ranch was similar to what Arnold had seen, or to the objects described in stories about flying saucers and discs, so he gathered some of the material from the wreckage, including rubber strips, tinfoil and thick paper, and deposited them with Sheriff George Wilcox, who in turn turned it over to the commanding officer of the Roswell Army Air Field.

Within 24 hours of the original press release, the military backtracked and said a mistake had been made and the “flying disc” was in reality a crashed weather balloon.

The story was widely accepted, and the Roswell incident might have become a forgotten chapter in history if not for a 1978 conversation between physicist and ufologist Stanton T. Friedman and Marcel, by then retired, according to an account in BBC's Sky At Night Magazine.

Marcel said the weather balloon story had been a cover, the photos had been staged, weather balloon debris had been substituted for the real wreckage, and that everyone involved in the retrieval believed it to be an extraterrestrial craft. The story was corroborated by a number of other retired military personnel who had been at Roswell at the time.

Some skeptics dismissed it as a tall tale, saying Marcel and others were seeking attention or writing themselves into the story. Regardless, Roswell became embedded in pop culture books, documentaries and movies.

One story that captured the attention of conspiracy theorists was that the wreckage had been seized by the military to reverse-engineer an extraterrestrial flight at Area 51 — a highly classified Air Force military installation in the Nevada desert primarily known for its role in developing and testing experimental aircraft and weapons systems. And a fake film clip purported to show “an alien autopsy” connected to Roswell.

Bowing to public pressure about the incident in the 1990s, the government launched a retrospective investigation that concluded the object that crashed was a Project Mogul weather balloon carrying top-secret equipment designed to search the atmosphere for evidence of Soviet nuclear tests.

2025 brings an interesting new twist to the story. 

According to an investigation by The Wall Street Journal published on June 6, the government fueled the UFO conspiracy theories, especially during the Cold War, to hide its true mission at Area 51. Specifically, the Pentagon wanted to conceal the development of advanced aircraft, such as the otherworldly-looking F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter, according to the report.

The disinformation campaign was uncovered by the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, established by the Pentagon in 2022, to investigate UAP reports. A report last year dismissed the notion that the government covered up the existence of extraterrestrial life But, The Journal reported, “public disclosure left out the truth behind some of the foundational myths about UFOs: The Pentagon itself sometimes deliberately fanned the flames, in what amounted to the U.S. government targeting its own citizens with disinformation.”

As an investigation of the possibility of deliberate misinformation to hide secret programs continues, the government continues to take UAP and other unexplained phenomena seriously, The Associated Press reported.

Since Supernatural concluded in 2020, the actors have had the opportunity, after fifteen years dedicated to a beloved long-running show, to expand their careers. The most successful has been Jensen Ackles, who has performed in smaller roles like the ones in Big Sky and Tracker as well as major roles like starring in the new crime thriller series, Countdown. Despite this, it seems the actor has not given up on his previous role, admitting to the audience that he's always willing to return to the small screen as Dean Winchester.

Previously, fans of Supernatural have been given hope that the show will return, especially when the actors or showrunners mention ""what if"" scenarios about a revival. However, Jensen Ackles' latest interview has given viewers even more hope, especially when he expresses not only his desire to return to the show, but others, including the renowned showrunner, Eric Kripke. Based on the most recent update from Ackles regarding the future of Supernatural, the chances of a revival are more likely than ever.

Supernatural ended five years ago after becoming the longest-running fantasy TV show in the U.S., breaking records and developing an extremely dedicated fanbase. The controversy surrounding the conclusion of the series is still an active and heated discussion among viewers, with many hating the finale and others respecting the way Sam and Dean Winchester's story ended. Regardless of how unpopular the conclusion was, however, the series continues to have a dedicated following.

The actor has had several iconic characters but credits one specifically for his career.

Supernatural is the most iconic The CW show ever, outpacing other wildly popular series like Gilmore Girls and The Vampire Diaries. The reason the show lasted so long is due to the dedicated fanbase who, despite having different opinions on the overall quality of the fifteen seasons, were unwilling to let go of their favorite series. In fact, the controversial aspects of Supernatural only encouraged the audience to demand more, which has led to constant interest.

Most shows that have been concluded for several years will see a significant decline in activity, especially when there seems to be nothing left to discuss or theorize about the future of the storyline. Supernatural is one of the few exceptions to this rule, with fans still widely showing an interest in the aired seasons and the potential for a continuation. Despite having been over since 2020, the fandom continues to grow, and more viewers are taking an interest in the future of Supernatural.

Fans continue to show up at Supernatural conventions and express their interest in a revival on social media, making the main cast, mainly Jensen Ackles (Dean Winchester), Jared Padalecki (Sam Winchester), and Misha Collins (Castiel), aware of their desires. Though these actors have moved on and dedicated their time to other TV shows, they're still open to returning to their previous roles. Even Jensen Ackles, who has had a successful career starring in The Boys, Tracker, and his new TV show, Countdown, emphasizes how he has been influenced by playing Dean Winchester even years after the show ended.

Five years later, the fantasy-horror show is as popular as ever.

Recently, on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Ackles was asked about a potential Supernatural revival, and he replied that the series is ""always hanging out there,"" according to TV Insider. Though he mainly talked about how Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins would guest star in the last season of The Boys, this reunion was due to their history working together. Ackles also pointed out that Eric Kripke, who is the showrunner for The Boys and was also for Supernatural, thought the two fanbases could increase the viewership for the last installment of the satirical superhero series.

This highlights how active the Supernatural fandom still is, not only raving about the hit series but also having enough respect for the actors to watch their other performances. Ackles and the other stars understand that the constant interest in Supernatural has a career of dedicated fans. In addition, they're aware there will always be a fanbase for the fantasy TV show, giving the viewers hope that one day they will revive the series for another exciting storyline.

While many Supernatural fans have not stopped talking about a revival since the series concluded, that doesn't mean there still isn't a significant amount of criticism for the fifteen seasons already available. In fact, there are many scenes in Supernatural that made viewers quit the show. This clarifies that even though the show is still popular and worthy of another installment, the narrative is not perfect and has a fair number of unpopular scenes and plots that were not popular among viewers.

Supernatural's ""Swan Song"" is hailed as Eric Kripke's perfect finale to the series, but his ending is actually much darker and unsatisfying.

Some fans would argue that the issues with Supernatural are the precise reason why the show should get another installment, whether that be with one more season or a complete revival of the world. Many viewers are still upset about certain character deaths, the lack of diversity or focus on supporting characters, and the contentious conclusion. There are many ways in which the showrunners could address these fan complaints with a revival.

Following the finale of Supernatural, there are some reunions that viewers never received, such as Castiel being brought back from the Empty by Jack but never reuniting with Sam or Dean Winchester. Other fans point out that the new world following a new God taking control was never explored, leaving too much about the finale up for interpretation. A continuation of Supernatural, even with a limited runtime, could answer some major questions and satisfy the fans with a more well-rounded conclusion to the renowned fantasy TV show.

There were several points throughout the fifteen seasons of Supernatural in which the storyline could have ended, but the reality is that the series continued for so long because there was always an audience willing to watch the next installment, regardless of how controversial it was. However, this isn't to say that fans will watch anything related to the fantasy world. In fact, the only spin-off that ever aired was the prequel, The Winchesters, which was canceled after its first season.

In The CW's Supernatural, hunters protect humanity from the things go that go bump in the night. It's not an easy job, but someone has to do it.

Viewers don't just want a Supernatural continuation that takes place in the same world as the flagship series. The only successful way the universe can continue is with another storyline that explores the futures of Sam and Dean Winchester. While this may seem impossible because both brothers have died and gone to Heaven, the show has proven that anyone can be brought back if there is a reasonable explanation.

After Supernatural ended, the hopes that the show would eventually get a revival were perceived as wishful thinking by a dedicated fanbase that didn't want to see their favorite show end. Despite this, the main stars have proven that it isn't just the audience that wants a revival. Based on how important these characters were in building these actors' careers, and how they have expressed an interest in returning, it is more likely than ever that Supernatural will eventually be revived.

There are plenty of conspiracy theories to come out of the White House over the years, with everything from what really happened to JFK to 'faked' Moon landings, allegations about Barack Obama's citizenship to the death of Jeffrey Epstein keeping tinfoil hats in business for decades.

More recently, the July 2024 assassination attempt of Donald Trump has set tongues wagging. While on the campaign trail near Butler, Pennsylvania, Trump was shot in the ear and wounded by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks.

Although Crooks wasn't successful in taking out the future President of the United States ahead of his second term, he killed one audience member and critically injured two others before he was shot dead by the Secret Service's Counter Sniper Team.

Away from theories that Donald Trump uses a body double, conspiracy theorists are back claiming that something fishy went down at the rally.

Advert

Images of a defiant Trump raising his fist in the air after being shot, the aftermath saw him sporting a giant bandage on his ear. Some of his MAGA supporters even took to wearing their own bandages in support of him, but after showing off his healed ear in recent photos, some think there's more to the story.

With the POTUS' ear looking as good as new, less than a year after the incident, users on X are claiming it was all an elaborate hoax.

Sharing photographs of his ear in 2018 and 2025, one person wrote: ""Ear cartilage generally does NOT regrow.""

Advert

Someone else said: ""Likely the biggest scam ever. No MSM follow-up. Just rolled with the narrative.""

Another added: ""Here's what people are missing: He's not even brave or strong enough to cut, slice, or pierce his ear to make it appear the whole thing was real. Think about that. Seriously. The cognitive dissonance is deafening.""

Another added: ""Here's what people are missing: He's not even brave or strong enough to cut, slice, or pierce his ear to make it appear the whole thing was real. Think about that. Seriously. The cognitive dissonance is deafening.""



Not everyone was convinced, with someone else chiming in: ""Y'all realize he's a billionaire right? You don't think the world's best plastic surgeons can repair an ear?😂😂😂.""

Advert

Another concluded: ""Dudes head gets blown off/ Liberal nut jobs: I think it was fake!""

Someone even asked Elon Musk's chatbot what it thinks. The AI admitted: ""The ear's appearance in 2025 images may reflect natural healing, not staging, despite cartilage not regrowing. Misinformation, like old photos, fuels skepticism but doesn't hold up.""

Senate Republicans passed a budget package with the deepest cuts to health care in decades on Tuesday.

Senate Republicans passed a budget package with the deepest cuts to health care in decades on Tuesday.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

As Senate Republicans rushed to pass a massive budget package known as the “big, beautiful bill,” the political consequences of pushing for the deepest cuts in decades to Medicaid and other safety net programs serving millions of people were already becoming clear. After working overnight to vote on a number of amendments and pass the package ahead of an entirely symbolic July 4 deadline imposed by President Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune was still struggling to find enough votes by the morning of July 1.

Vice President J.D. Vance arrived at the Capitol Tuesday morning to cast the tie-breaking vote, allowing the GOP majority to pass the package by a slim 51-50 margin that largely fell along party lines, with Republican Senators Thom Tillis (North Carolina), Rand Paul (Kentucky), and Susan Collins (Maine) joining Democrats to vote against the bill. The final version now goes back to the House for approval, where Speaker Mike Johnson must bridge divisions between far-right fiscal hawks and moderates wary of defunding rural hospitals in their districts before sending the bill to Trump's desk.

Democrats and opposition groups call the bill the Trump Tax Scam, and with solid majorities turning against it in poll after poll, they are preparing to hammer Republicans for supporting cuts that will harm their constituents ahead of the 2026 midterms. Republicans are repeating falsehoods about the bill's impacts, especially on health care, and lashing out in response — or calling it quits altogether.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Tillis and Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska both announced this week that they would not seek reelection after becoming embroiled in the controversy over proposed cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program for lower-income people that has expanded in both of their home states.

“Every single Republican senator has to decide whether they're more afraid of Trump than the consequences of taking away lifesaving health coverage from their own constituents,” said Leor Tal, director of the Unrig Our Economy campaign, which calls on lawmakers to reject the cuts, in a statement on Monday ahead of the final vote.

The budget legislation slashes funding for Medicaid and other health programs by $1.1 trillion, leaving an estimated 11.8 million people without health coverage by 2034 and saddling states with new costs and additional bureaucratic red tape. Millions more could lose coverage and face higher costs due to changes to tax credits and subsidies for lower- and middle-income people who rely on Affordable Care Act plans.

Experts say the added stress on the health system could drive up health costs for everyone, but Republicans must make cuts to federal spending to pay for Trump's priorities, including his mass deportation campaign and an extension of the 2017 tax breaks. Even with deep cuts to the social safety net, the Senate version of the budget package would add more than $3 trillion to the national debt. The Senate bill became more regressive as negotiations dragged on, with the latest analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation showing tax hikes on people making less than $30,000 a year and generous tax cuts for the rich.

Doctors warn the cuts would devastate rural hospitals and newly opened addiction clinics that rely on Medicaid, and patients will die as a result. In the end, the GOP mantra about targeting “waste, fraud and abuse” was not enough to win over Tillis, whose home state of North Carolina expanded Medicaid to cover an additional 600,000 people in 2023. Tillis made statements referencing his personal experience growing up in a low-income family and, shortly after announcing his retirement on Sunday, warned his colleagues in a speech on the Senate floor that they would have to face constituents who lose access to health care in the years to come.

“What do I tell 663,000 people in two years or three years, when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the funding's not there anymore, guys?” Tillis said on Sunday.

Democrats point out that Tillis, who was first elected to Congress in 2014, rode a wave of right-wing backlash to President Barack Obama and the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which made Medicaid expansion possible in North Carolina and across the country. While Tillis opposes these particular cuts, critics point out that he pushed to repeal the ACA and block Medicaid expansion in the past.

“If Thom Tillis says the Medicaid cuts are this bad, you know they're bad,” said Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, a civil rights leader and co-chair of the Poor People's Campaign, in a social media post on Tillis's remarks.

On Saturday, Tillis and Sen. Rand Paul were the only Republicans who voted against advancing the “big, beautiful bill” during a procedural vote, but Republicans leveraged their majority in a 51-49 vote to move the package forward. Tillis quickly drew the ire of Trump, who attacked his fellow Republican on social media and pledged to back a primary challenger should Tillis pursue reelection in 2026.

“Too many elected officials are motivated by pure raw politics who really don't give a damn about the people they promised to represent on the campaign trail,” Tillis said in a statement on Sunday announcing his retirement from Congress at the end of the term.

In order to woo moderates wary of shuttering rural hospitals, the Senate approved $50 billion over five years in funding that states can apply for in order to prevent clinics from closing. However, moderate Republicans in the House have called the measure “bullshit” because the funds will provide little or no support to many districts, and some still oppose changes to the tax code for local Medicaid providers that will pass massive costs onto states, according to Politico.

The Senate bill also slashes environmental protections and grant funding for clean energy initiatives that have flourished under investments made during the Biden administration. Oil Change International, a group fighting pollution and climate change, called the package “perhaps the most harmful piece of legislation for the environment in U.S. history.”



“New research shows the bill includes nearly $18 billion in new giveaways to the fossil fuel industry over the next 10 years,” said Collin Rees, the U.S. campaigns manager at Oil Change International, in a statement on Tuesday. “That's on top of the $170 billion in taxpayer-funded subsidies the industry is already set to receive over the next decade.”

Now, House Republicans are feeling the heat. Rep. Mike Lawler of New York was “taken to task” over Medicaid cuts during a “stormy” town hall meeting in his home district in the Hudson Valley on Saturday, according to the Poughkeepsie Journal. Lawler reportedly defended the proposed changes to Medicaid, but a video of a constituent declaring “you failed and should leave” went viral after the town hall. At a previous town hall, Lawler faced voters Politico described as “pissed off and fired up.” An estimated 1.5 million New Yorkers could lose health coverage under the House version of the budget bill.

Republican Rep. Don Bacon was under mounting pressure to reject Medicaid cuts from frustrated constituents and the medical community back home in Nebraska before announcing on Monday that he would not seek reelection in his key swing district. Bacon initially expressed some hesitation about the sweeping cuts but said he decided to vote for the House version of the budget bill after receiving “assurances” that it would not degrade the quality of health care for Medicaid recipients — if they manage to keep their coverage.

In a statement, Bacon called himself a “traditional conservative” at odds with his party on foreign policy and Trump's erratic tariff regime. However, Bacon has also faced a blistering ad campaign, paid for by Unrig Our Economy, that features working mothers and other Medicaid recipients in Nebraska demanding Bacon vote against cuts to their health care. At one point the National Republican Congressional Committee sent a threatening but toothless letter to a local TV station demanding the ads be taken off the air.

Meanwhile, Bacon took to social media to defend the GOP's controversial work requirements for Medicaid enrollees, accusing Unrig Our Economy of being a proxy group for Democrats.

“We hope Congressman Bacon has an easier time finding health care than the 40,000 Nebraskans he voted to rip health coverage away from,” said Tal of Unrig Our Economy. “When the Tax Scam returns to the House, Congressman Bacon has one more opportunity to do the right thing and finally vote against cuts to Medicaid and SNAP programs his constituents rely on.”

Last week, the advocacy group Nebraska For Us convened a panel of experts from the state to discuss the potential fallout from the Republican plan to drastically reduce Medicaid rolls by introducing work requirements and using other budgetary tactics. David Palm, director of the Center for Health Policy at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said federal health spending could fall by $3 to $4 billion in the state.

“Hospitals and physician clinics would take a hit and potentially even close — affecting patients and employees,” Palm said. “This would also create more stress on health departments and nonprofits that are already underfunded. These cuts are so huge, and it is difficult for people to wrap their arms around them.”

Angie Lauritsen, the state director of Nebraska For Us, said the group has also held a discussion on proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which helped 150,000 Nebraskans put food on the table last year.

“At the same time, we raised awareness of the rising cost of back-to-school expenses and child care along with the [Omaha] metro's growing food insecurity crisis while Congressman Bacon voted to cut health care and take food from his constituents to give more tax breaks to the wealthy,” Lauritsen said in a statement on Monday.

The advocacy may be paying off. On June 25, Bacon joined 15 other House Republicans in penning a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune warning that they cannot support a budget bill that transfers significant Medicaid costs onto their states. With a slim majority, only a handful of GOP defects could still sink the “big, beautiful bill” in the House.

“We urge Congressman Bacon to end his congressional career on a positive note and vote against it rather than once again voting for those cuts just to fund tax breaks for the top 1 percent,” Lauritsen said.

LONDON (AP) — Tennis fans and players did their best to stay cool on the opening days of the Wimbledon tournament in London. Athletes pressed ice bags on their head while fans did their best to create shade with hats, umbrellas and clothing.

Monday saw record-breaking Day 1 heat as the temperature rose to 91 degrees Fahrenheit — 33 Celsius — at the oldest Grand Slam tournament. The temperature soared again on Tuesday to 93 degrees Fahrenheit — 34 Celsius.

SJSU volleyball player Brooke Slusser provides updates on her lawsuit over alleged threats and actions from transgender teammate and the conflict of interest within the investigation on ‘America Reports'.

FIRST ON FOX: The U.S. Department of Education announced Tuesday that the University of Pennsylvania has agreed to a resolution with President Donald Trump's administration to keep biological male trans athletes out of women's sports, in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.

The department previously launched an investigation into UPenn on Feb. 6 for Title IX violations that occurred in the swimming program. Trans athlete Lia Thomas competed for the women's team in the 2021-22 season, after previously competing for the men's team. 

""Today, the U.S. Department of Education (the Department) announced the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) has entered into a Resolution Agreement to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX),"" the statement read.

Per the DOE's announcement, under UPenn's new agreement the following actions will be taken: 

U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon credited Trump for the resolution. 

""Thanks to the leadership of President Trump, UPenn has agreed both to apologize for its past Title IX violations and to ensure that women's sports are protected at the University for future generations of female athletes,"" McMahon said in a statement. 

""Today is a great victory for women and girls not only at the University of Pennsylvania, but all across our nation. The Department commends UPenn for rectifying its past harms against women and girls, and we will continue to fight relentlessly to restore Title IX's proper application and enforce it to the fullest extent of the law."" 

Former UPenn women's swimmer Paula Scanlan, who was the first of Thomas' teammates on the women's team to speak out against the school for allowing the situation to play out, told Fox News Digital that she is ""grateful."" 

HOW TRANSGENDERISM IN SPORTS SHIFTED THE 2024 ELECTION AND IGNITED A NATIONAL COUNTERCULTURE

""I am deeply grateful to the Trump administration for standing firm in protecting women and girls and restoring our rightful accolades,"" Scanlan said. 

""It is because of their strong leadership that my alma mater now knows it has no choice but to begin the process of reforming its policies to uphold women's rights. Today marks a momentous step toward repairing the past mistreatment of female athletes and forging a future where sex discrimination no longer limits girls' potential.""

Scanlan isn't the only one of Thomas' former teammates to speak out anymore. 

Three other former UPenn swimmers filed a lawsuit against the university on Feb. 5, the same day Trump signed the ""Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"" executive order. 

The lawsuit sought to have Thomas' accolades withdrawn and redistributed to the women's swimmers who competed against the athlete, and it alleges university administrators suggested any female swimmer opposed to Thomas competing with them had a ""psychological problem"" and were referred to the school's LGBTQ center. 

Trump's administration later froze $175 million in funding for the school on March 20. Then, on April 28, the Education Department's Office of Civil Rights announced its investigation concluded that UPenn did violate Title IX in its handling of the Thomas situation.

The Thomas saga at the 2022 NCAA championships is largely considered a cultural turning point in the national debate over transgender athletes in women's sports. Back then, current prominent conservative activist Riley Gaines was just a dental student who had to settle for a tie with Thomas in one of the NCAA championship events. 

Since then, Gaines has taken the lead on an entire political platform focused on combating male inclusion in women's and girls' sports, stemming from her experience competing against Thomas in 2022. 

Gaines previously told Fox News Digital that she would send a ""thank-you"" note to ""people like"" Thomas for bringing attention to the issue back then, as she believes it influenced the 2024 election. 

""I think we should send a thank-you note to people like Will Thomas, I really do, signed and sealed by me. I will sign the thank-you note, I will write it, because I believe he handed us the election,"" Gaines said. 

""There was a lot that was wrong with Joe Biden, his administration and the Democratic Party as a whole outside of the sports stuff … but this was the perfect visual. It's like the South Park episode. … It painted the picture that many of us were concerned about for a while, but made it a reality.""

A national exit poll conducted by the Concerned Women for America legislative action committee found that 70% of moderate voters saw the issue of ""Donald Trump's opposition to transgender boys and men playing girls' and women's sports and of transgender boys and men using girls' and women's bathrooms"" as important to them. Additionally, 6% said it was the most important issue of all, while 44% said it was ""very important.""

Clean energy stocks rose on Tuesday after a tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Shares of NextEra Energy, the largest renewables developer in the U.S., rose about 5% after the Senate narrowly passed President Donald Trump's bill on Tuesday. AES, a leading renewable provider, rose about 2%. The megabill will now go to the House of Representatives, where lawmakers will consider the Senate's changes.

The clean energy industry was surprised and outraged to find over the weekend that a tax on wind and solar projects had been inserted into a version of the Senate legislation. The tax applied to projects that use components from foreign entities of concern above a certain threshold. Foreign entities of concern is widely understood to basically refer to China.

The tax was ultimately struck from the Senate legislation, the American Clean Power Association (ACP) and Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) told CNBC. The measure was punitive and would have added up to $7 billion to the solar and wind industry's tax burden, said John Hensley, ACP's senior vice president for market analysis.

The Senate bill still phases out the clean electricity investment and production tax credits for wind and solar, though the timeline isn't quite as strict as previous versions of the legislation. These credits have played a crucial role in the expansion of renewable energy in the U.S.

Projects that start construction within 12 months of the bill becoming law can still qualify for full tax credits, according to ACP. Projects that start construction after 12 months have to enter service by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, according to ACP.

The benchmark Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) gained 2.9%, while the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) rose 0.8% after the legislation passed.

Shares of First Solar, the largest solar panel manufacturer in the U.S., slipped more than 1%. Sun tracker manufacturers Array Technologies and Nextracker jumped more than 12% and 5%, respectively.

Residential solar installer Sunrun more than 10% while inverter manufacturers SolarEdge and Enphase gained about 7% and 3%, respectively.

But SEIA cautioned that the improvements in the Senate bill are limited and the legislation overall is still harmful to renewable energy. ACP described the bill as ""a step backward for American energy policy."" 

""This legislation undermines the very foundation of America's manufacturing comeback and global energy leadership,"" Abigail Ross Hopper, the CEO of SEIA, said in a statement. ""If this bill becomes law, families will face higher electric bills, factories will shut down, Americans will lose their jobs, and our electric grid will grow weaker.""

 Crypto ETF summer has arrived with America's first staked Solana ETP and increased odds for other spot altcoin funds, according to analysts. 

Analysts covering the crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) space have tipped a 95% chance for Solana, Litecoin, and XRP ETFs to be approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission this year.

Bloomberg's ETF specialists Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart increased their odds for several altcoin spot exchange-traded funds in an X post on Monday. 

“We expect a wave of new ETFs in the second half of 2025,” said Syeffart. 

The pair tipped the odds for Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC) spot ETF approval at 95%, up from 90%. 

They gave the same odds for the approval of an ETF based on a basket or index of crypto assets. 

The final SEC deadline for a decision on the three altcoin ETFs is in October, while a crypto basket ETF could be approved this week, according to the analysts. 

The analysts had also tipped the odds of approval for other altcoin spot ETFs to 90%, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), Hedera (HBAR), and Avalanche (AVAX), with final decisions due in the fourth quarter.

ETFs filed by Canary Capital for Sui (SUI) and Tron (TRX) had lower approval odds, at 60% and 50%, respectively. 

In June, Balchunas said “get ready for a potential altcoin ETF summer,” while Seyffart opined that “ETFs that track broad crypto indexes may be approved by the SEC next month.” 

Bloomberg also reported on Monday that the REX Osprey Solana Staking ETF is officially set to launch on Wednesday, becoming the first in the US to allow crypto staking. 

The product faced initial regulatory hurdles with the SEC, which objected after clearing its registration. The main issue was whether the ETF qualified as an investment company under securities laws.

To gain approval, the issuers compromised by agreeing to invest at least 40% of assets in other ETPs, mostly domiciled outside the US.

Meanwhile, the SEC is not ready to approve Ethereum staking yet, on Monday delaying its decision on whether the Bitwise spot Ether ETF could include staking.

The regulator also delayed its decision to approve the listing and trading of shares of the Osprey Bitcoin Trust.

Russia's Space Program Is Another Casualty of the War in Ukraine

To achieve its ambitious plans for missions to the moon and beyond, Russia needs other spacefaring nations as partners. But the war in Ukraine is making that help increasingly hard to find

By Eugene Gerden edited by Lee Billings

A Russian Soyuz rocket is raised on the launch pad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on April 5, 2025. Launching three days later, it carried NASA astronaut Jonny Kim and Roscosmos cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritskiy as part of the Expedition 73 mission to the International Space Station.

As president, Donald Trump has made no secret of his desire for a U.S. rapprochement with Russia, in distinct contrast with the policies of previous administrations. On June 16, for instance, he called Russia's expulsion from the elite Group of Seven (G7) forum of major advanced economies a “mistake.” (The nation was expelled in 2014 after it annexed Crimea in Ukraine.) And Trump has been far more lenient than his presidential predecessors in pursuing sanctions on Russia related to its war with Ukraine while also imposing relatively minimal tariffs on the nation as part of his overarching effort to realign global trade.

Some experts have speculated that this high-level thaw in U.S.-Russia relations could extend to the nations' cooperation on the high frontier. The U.S. and Russia are already close partners on the International Space Station (ISS); NASA and the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, have worked together for more than 30 years to build and operate the orbital habitat.

Despite ongoing geopolitical tensions, in April Roscosmos's director general Dmitry Bakanov and NASA associate administrator for space operations Ken Bowersox met at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to discuss the status of the ISS partnership, which includes “cross-flights” of U.S. astronauts on Russian rockets—and vice versa. Soon afterward, NASA confirmed the agencies had coordinated crew changes for upcoming cross-flights and extended the corresponding agreement through 2027.

“NASA, Roscosmos and our other international partners remain focused on the continued safe and professional operation of the International Space Station in low-Earth orbit,” a NASA spokesperson tells Scientific American. “International Space Station cooperation continues smoothly, as it has throughout the continuous presence of our joint crews for nearly 25 years.”

Even so, this partnership has an expiration date: NASA's current plan is for the ISS to be abandoned and deorbited by 2031. And apart from the ISS, these days, the two countries have minimal collaboration on space science and exploration.

For instance, Russia has been conspicuously absent from the long-simmering U.S. efforts to return astronauts to the moon via NASA's Artemis program. Instead Roscosmos is pursuing an independent plan for robotic and crewed lunar exploration, and in 2021 it announced a partnership with China to construct a crewed moon base. Although neither Russia nor China have been especially forthcoming about the finer details and status of such plans, recent statements from Gennady Krasnikov, president of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS), during a general meeting of RAS members at the end of May suggest that Russia is attempting to accelerate its lunar program, which will unfold across multiple missions.

“As for the lunar program, it includes seven lunar missions with various scientific objectives,” Krasnikov said. “At the first stage of the study, our research works will be based on automatic flights.” Some, if not all, of these missions will target the moon's north and south poles, where significant deposits of water ice have been discovered. “We also plan to send lunar rovers to study the area and prepare for the placement of a future lunar station,” Krasnikov said. “This is a large and very important program and, of course, a serious challenge for our academic institutions.”

Lev Zelenyi, chief research officer of the Space Research Institute, the leading organization within RAS on space exploration, tells Scientific American he has modest hopes for deeper cooperation between the U.S. and Russia in the space sector.

“Naturally, I see potential and hope that it will be realized in something concrete—although it is difficult to say what it will be yet,” Zelenyi says. “However, in the case of the Russian lunar program, it is going its own way, and I do not see great prospects for cooperation here.”

One potential area ripe for partnership, he adds, is Venus—a world that only the Soviet-era Russian space program has ever managed to land on. It remains a tempting destination for Russia's modern-day interplanetary probes. Bakanov, for example, treats Russia's return there as a foregone conclusion. In a recent Telegram post, he declared, “We will explore Venus; we are the only country that has landed a device on it.”

“It seems promising to me to resume cooperation in Venus exploration programs,” Zelenyi says. “Both Russia and the United States have great interest in this planet and have serious programs for its study. In my opinion, a meeting of Russian and American scientists to discuss all these issues would be useful. It could be held under the auspices of our [respective] academies of sciences, as both have their own space councils.”

Still, despite such measured optimism, independent analysts of Russia's space activities believe it will be difficult for the nation to resume large-scale cooperation with the U.S. in this domain. In the case of Venus, one obstacle is that the White House has signaled it has other priorities for NASA. For instance, it has proposed to cancel the space agency's two planned Venus-focused missions, and to eliminate NASA's involvement in Envision, a Venus mission led by the European Space Agency (ESA). More broadly, Russia's war in Ukraine remains the chief stumbling block—not only because of the backlash it fostered from the U.S. and European allies but also because the war effort has strained Russia's coffers and distracted its scientific and technical workforce. All this has contributed to recent financial cuts and technical delays for Russia's space program.

Vadim Lukashevich, an aerospace expert and a former designer at aerospace design bureau Sukhoi, tells Scientific American that because Russia's modern lunar program was developed before the Russian-Ukrainian war and the associated unprecedented international sanctions on Russia's economy, the planning had assumed active international cooperation, including with NASA.

“The first joint projects of NASA and Roscosmos in lunar orbit were considered possible as early as 2024,” Lukashevich says, referring to NASA's Gateway project, which is meant to be a “way station” of sorts in high lunar orbit (and which the White House also has targeted for cancellation as part of its sweeping proposed cuts). “It was expected that Russia had the most serious competencies in the field of creating habitable modules, which, together with a new [crewed] ship and superheavy rocket, would provide Russia with a strategically advantageous role in the international program for the exploration of the moon.”

According to Lukashevich and other Russian scientists interviewed for this story, Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, upended those carefully laid plans, dramatically changing the nation's prospects for near-term progress in space. Now funding cuts and technical problems have curtailed plans for a new crewed spacecraft. Called Orel—Russian for “eagle”—the project has been officially in development for more than a decade, and its first uncrewed test flight was targeted for 2023. That flight has now slipped to no earlier than 2028—and its intended launch vehicle, a modified Angara-A5 rocket, is still being designed.

A similar cascade of delays and cuts is affecting other parts of Russia's space infrastructure, too. The superheavy Yenisei rocket intended for the nation's lunar missions had reached a critical milestone, the approval of its preliminary design, in late 2019. But today Yenisei's development is on hiatus because of a lack of funds, and the projected time frame for the first crewed flight to the moon has receded to an ill-defined target date in the 2030s. And in November 2024 Roscosmos announced that the already approved draft design of Yenisei “will be finalized at the technical design stage” and that “flights of Russian cosmonauts to the moon are postponed.”

Hoped-for bright spots in this gloomy outlook have failed to materialize. In April 2022 the ESA, responding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, pulled out of multiple planned Russian robotic lunar missions. In August 2023, under the management of Zelenyi, Russia plowed ahead on its own, launching its robotic Luna-25 lunar lander, but the spacecraft malfunctioned during an orbital maneuver and crashed to the moon's surface. In July 2022 ESA also officially nixed Russia's participation in ExoMars, an ESA-led robotic mission to the Red Planet. To relay ESA's Rosalind Franklin rover to the Martian surface, Roscosmos had been due to deliver a lander called Kazachok; ESA subsequently turned to NASA for a lander, although those plans are now in question because of the White House's proposed cuts to NASA's budget, and the mission is unlikely to launch before 2028.

The demonstrable diminution of Russia's space-exploration capabilities and plans makes the nation's need for partnerships all the more urgent—and, some analysts say, all the harder to come by because Russia seemingly has less to offer potential partners. This is a departure from previous eras in which Russia's prowess with rocketry and space stations enticed even the U.S., its cold war adversary, into multiple human spaceflight collaborations, with the jointly operated ISS as the relationship's crown jewel.

And back then, even if the U.S. had been unable or unwilling to partner with Russia in support of its peaceful space activities, a more subtle partnership was inescapable because some workhorse U.S. rockets relied upon Russian-made engines. Now, however, that's no longer the case, says Pavel Koshkin, a senior research fellow at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute for U.S. and Canadian Studies. “While the program of cross-flights to the ISS still exists, the United States abandoned Russian RD-180 engines for its Atlas V launch vehicles in 2024, finding a domestic alternative to them of its own production,” Koshkin says. “And this trend is unlikely to change in the near future despite Trump's favorable attitude towards Russia.”

The 11 U.S. host city committees for next year's FIFA men's World Cup are one step closer to receiving their requested $625 million in funding for security costs at the tournament, after the U.S. Senate passed an amended version of President Donald Trump's domestic policy bill on Tuesday. The bill now heads to a vote in the House of Representatives this week, and then, if passed, to President Trump's desk for a signature.

The version of the bill passed by the Senate also included an additional $500 million made available for “state and local capabilities to detect, identify, track or monitor threats from unmanned aircraft systems (otherwise known as drones),” which has also become a key security concern for World Cup stadiums and fan festivals.

The bill also includes $1 billion set aside for security, planning and other costs related to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.

The host cities, as per their contract with FIFA, are expected to carry much of the security costs for the tournament, both at stadiums and in surrounding areas. Many have already dipped into the pockets of city and state taxpayers and funds and sought private support and donations, in addition to the formal request for $625 million to share the burden of security costs for next summer's tournament.

The cities hope to get billions in economic impact from the millions of visitors who they want to arrive in the U.S. during the month-long competition.

The World Cup funding is just one line of a mega-bill that includes sweeping reforms to domestic policy. The reconciliation bill passed Tuesday has been fiercely contested in the Senate and required a tie-breaking 51-50 vote by Vice President JD Vance. The bill now heads to the House of Representatives, with the aim for it to be at President Trump's desk by July 4, although this timescale depends on House Republicans having adequate support.

If passed, the funding would represent a considerable success for U.S. Soccer, which has supported the host cities in their lobbying, as well as for FIFA, whose president, Gianni Infantino, appears to have developed a close relationship with President Trump. Infantino attended a pre-inauguration rally for Trump and the inauguration itself. Infantino has since attended several events at the White House, including one for the establishment of the FIFA World Cup White House Task Force, chaired by President Trump.

The U.S. will co-host the World Cup with Canada and Mexico, but American cities will host 75 percent of the 48-team tournament, including all games from the quarter-final stage of the competition onwards.

The Athletic reported in March how the U.S. cities had engaged D.C. lobbyists to convince the Trump administration to commit federal cash to a tournament they argued was a national and international event, despite being hosted in local cities. According to filings registered at the U.S. Senate Lobby Disclosure website, the host committees jointly spent six-figure numbers to enlist Hogan Lovells US LLP as part of their persuasion attempts.

Democrats and Republicans have been fiercely split over the Republican-led bill, which includes billions of dollars in cuts to things such as Medicaid and green energy efforts. But the host cities' request has received bipartisan support. On November 26, 2024, Democrat Rep. Josh Gottheimer and Republican Rep. Darin LaHood sent a joint letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, asking for the funding to go into end-of-year packages.

The letter described the 2026 tournament as “the largest sporting event in history” and therefore “a reasonable and necessary investment in our national security, particularly in light of the evolving global threat landscape and the growing risks associated with large public gatherings.” It said the requested funding would support “critical infrastructure enhancements, cybersecurity measures, and the necessary training for local and state law enforcement.”

A further letter was sent to the House Appropriations Committee on December 6, 2024, this time signed by 48 members of Congress, urging support for Fiscal Year 2025 funding for the World Cup. The letter claimed that the “scale and geographic scope” of the tournament means the security risks are unprecedented, saying that the multi-billion viewing figures projected for the tournament render it a “uniquely attractive target for malicious actors.” The letter also said that intelligence from the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center “confirms an increase in threats targeting stadiums and public events.”

Previous attempts to secure the funding had been unsuccessful. In March, a “continuing resolution,” drafted by House Republicans, was passed through the Senate to fund the U.S. government through the rest of the fiscal year until October, but did not include the funding. Now, however, the cities have moved one step closer to securing the federal funding.

Four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka has opened up about how she was blindsided when controversial Aussie Nick Kyrgios made an unexpected appearance in her coaching box at Wimbledon.

Disrupted by knee and wrist injuries, Kyrgios will not be involved as a player at Wimbledon, making this the third consecutive year he has missed out. 

His last appearance on the court at Wimbledon came in 2022, when he lost the final to Novak Djokovic.

Last year the 30-year-old was a part of the BBC's punditry team, alongside Tim Henman and John McEnroe, but was not included this time around.

The broadcaster's decision to include the Australian on the panel 12 months after he admitted to assaulting his former girlfriend Chiara Passari - but avoided a criminal conviction - was met with a fierce backlash from the public and MPs.

Kyrgios was also overlooked by ESPN this year despite featuring on their panel at the Australian Open, and previously worked for the Tennis Channel and TNT Sports.

Naomi Osaka got her Wimbledon title tilt off to a good start by defeating Talia Gibson 6-4 7-6

Nick Kyrgios was spotted in Osaka's player's box - but the Japanese star had no idea that he was courtside

However, the Aussie firebrand is at the event this year after securing a punditry role with TalkSport - and on day one of the tournament he watched Osaka in action on Court 18.

Kyrgios, who is signed to Osaka's management group, is set to play mixed doubles with the Japanese star at the US Open in August.

Following her 6-4 7-6 win over Talia Gibson, Osaka was asked about Kyrgios in her player's box and she admitted she had no idea he was there.

'Oh, he was there? I did not hear anything, OK,' she said.

Osaka added: 'Oh, my God. I jokingly told someone, ""Hey, I know Nick's around, maybe he wants to come to my match"".

'But I was joking, because I know we're two completely different players. Honestly, I would have loved to come to his matches, because I know he's pretty fun.

'Yeah, I think that's also a big part of why we're different is because I know he kind of tells his box what to do, and he probably would have noticed if I was in there. I kind of zone out most of the time.

'That's a little embarrassing that he was there.

Kyrgios is set to play mixed doubles with the Japanese star (pictured together) at the US Open in August

Kyrgios' last appearance on the court at Wimbledon came in 2022, when he lost the men's singles final to Novak Djokovic 

'I guess it is cool that he was there.'

Kyrgios has been tormented by a succession of injuries in the last two-and-a-half years and has only played six singles and three doubles matches since the start of 2023, winning one of each.

But the prospect of the short-form event at the US Open with Osaka, and a star-studded cast, has persuaded him to enter along with a series of intriguing pairings.

Only two of the 20 current top-10 male and female players have to date declined to put their names forward in a victory for the organisers' rebrand, the creation of which drew condemnation from regular doubles players including Australia's Ellen Perez.

Men's No.1 Jannik Sinner has paired with American women's world No.9 Emma Navarro and men's No.2 Carlos Alcaraz with former US Open winner Emma Raducanu. Women's No.1 Aryna Sabalenka has linked up with men's No.19 Grigor Dimitrov.

Men's No.9 Holger Rune and women's No.2 Coco Gauff are the current top-10 players not to have entered so far, nor have Australian No.1s Alex de Minaur and Daria Kasatkina - the entry window closes on July 28.

However, de Minaur said he and his British fiancée Kate Boulter, currently world No.39, were planning on doing so.

'We're definitely going to be keen to try and play if they allow us to and if they want us to,' he said. 'If that's an option, then we'll definitely be up for it.'

Sixteen teams have signed up with the top eight with the best combined singles ranking guaranteed a place along with eight wildcard entries.

Kyrgios and Osaka would need a wildcard, being ranked 633rd and 57th respectively, but given the revamp is aimed at attracting more fans, viewers and sponsors there is little doubt such a high-profile duo would get one.

Yeah, I wouldn't count on this lasting more than one season. At least not with her. Not becayse she's bad, but because she once told an Agatha All Along cast member she dosen't do second seasons. So, either this is a miniseries or she'll leave if there's a second season.

	Universal theatrical release will hit stateside tomorrow (not tonight) at 4,000 theaters before upping to 4,300 by Friday. The studio doesn't really believe in previews on discount Tuesday and has generally launched hard on Wednesday. The five-day forecast is $120M-$130M. Universal is taking a majority of the PLF screens away from Apple Original Films and Warner Bros' F1 which will hold onto its Imax gas for what's hoped to be a $28M+ second 3-day or better.

	We always have to asterisk the fact that moviegoing can ratchet down due to barbeques, beach, swimming pool and fireworks on the July 4th holiday. If there's heat on a title, then that theory is thrown out the window, however, distributors would love it if Independence Day didn't fall on a Friday. Uni has owned the July 4th stretch for the most part post Covid except for 2023 when Disney had Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Post Covid Independence Day No. 1 opening wins for Uni include 2021's F9 ($70M 3-day), 2022's Minions: The Rise of Gru ($123M 4-day) and last year's Despicable Me 4 ($122.6M 5-day).

	











	While Universal restarted the Steven Spielberg-born franchise in 2015 with Jurassic World under the directing watch of Colin Trevorrow with new cast members Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, that movie is still the biggest opening in the 32-year old franchise at $525.5M worldwide (unadjusted for inflation) and $208.8M domestic, the previous movie, 2022's Jurassic World: Dominion, despite grossing $1 billion including $157M from China, seemed to have run its course story-wise. Rotten Tomatoes critics' rating fell to its lowest across the six-picture franchise at 29%. Despite an A- CinemaScore (the lowest ever for a Jurassic movie was the Joe Johnston-directed 2001 Jurassic Park III with a B-), it was decided then an injection of Viagra and Testosterone was needed for these pre-historic beasts, enter returning scribe David Koepp who adapted the first two Michael Crichton penned novels, Jurassic Park and The Lost World: Jurassic Park, for the big screen (the author co-wrote the first 1993 movie with Koepp). Also, let's not forget a director who knows something about large lizards and genre, Gareth Edwards, who helmed the first Legendary Monsterverse title, 2014's Godzilla, which did just over a half billion worldwide, and the prequel, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which did $1.05 billion.

	Koepp had a way in with a story set five years after Jurassic World Dominion. The Earth's atmosphere has become inhospitable to dinosaurs, hence they are now confined to rainforest areas around the Equator. The three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their DNA, the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind. Scarlett Johansson, a gun for hire (and not any girl with a gun, hello, it's Black Widow herself, Johansson!), leads a bio-research team who has their greedy eye on making that new drug. Two-time Oscar winner Mahershala Ali plays the Johansson's character's friend with the boat, Rupert Friend is the bad guy, Jonathan Bailey plays a doctor with a sense of decency and they're all in the way of creatures with big claws with a shipwrecked family in town (played by Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Luna Blaise, David Iacono and Audrina Miranda as the Delgado family).


	What are audiences thinking about this reboot? On U.S. tracking, First Choice is high with men over 25, followed by women over 25. Overall first choice is close to where 2018's Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was (the fourth film in the series), that pic directed by J.A. Bayona opening to a domestic 3-day of $148M, but behind 2022's Dominion, which debuted to $145M stateside over Friday-Sunday. Despite the heavy over-25 interest, Foreign comps to consider include the previous three entries in the franchise, even though this is a new take on the series. It's also a real thing that heatwaves in Europe are a factor right now. Still, we expect this one to perform.Each of the most recent trio of movies ultimately went on to gross over $1B-plus globally, led by 2015's huge franchise return, Jurassic World with $1.67 billion, still the tenth highest grossing movie ever. China contributed a sizable chunk to each of those three films, and while Rebirth leads presales through Sunday in that market, times have changed meaning it's a wait-and-see how it delivers. In what's become a rarer move for studios, Universal held a premiere in Shanghai on Sunday with Johansson, Friend, Bailey and Edwards in attendance. Along with China, the recent Jurassics have performed the best in a mix of Mexico, the UK, France, Germany, Australia, Korea and Japan (again, the latter not going this weekend).Universal unveiled extended footage for exhibitors at CineEurope in Barcelona last month, and it was roundly one of the most positively talked about sneak peeks.Among other travel for the Jurassic World Rebirth crew, there was a world premiere in London on June 17, followed by Berlin the next day. A Grand Rex red carpet was held in Paris on June 22 with Edwards and score composer Alexandre Desplat.

Saw Advanced screening in RPX. This movie is awful. I mean it's so bad that audience members were actively rooting for the monsters to win . I say monsters because these aren't dinosaurs. There is a TRex who is basically the worst trex ever . The giant Rancor monster in all the ads has about 3 minutes of screen time and it's a useless mobster at best . There is a family thrown in to the movie for diversity reasons is my guess and you will want them all to die after spending 5 minutes with them . Skip this movie and watch F1

It's no wonder the WB bots are review bombing this movie.

Superman will have strong competition.

Jurassic World started with $525 million worldwide over 3 days and this one is starting with $260 million over 5 days…Ouch!

There is so much to love about FX's “The Bear.” From its technical precision to its culinary exhibition and intimate, chaotic character work, this vivid kitchen drama had no business being the megahit that it's become.

Season 4 is the show's weakest, if only because Christopher Storer and Joanna Calo set such a high bar in previous seasons. IndieWire's spoiler-free review noted a dulled momentum when it came to key plot development and character growth. The mouthwatering food closeups still work wonders (really, all of the closeups — including those which place viewers so close to an actor's face that you can practically read their mind), the dialogue still flies almost faster than Tina's pasta (Liza Colón-Zayas), and there are more Faks than ever (though, unlike Season 3, it doesn't feel like it).

But even after an objectively solid batch of episodes, “The Bear” feels stuck. It's doing what it does best, but not doing much more — and that may be the problem. Without further ado (the clock is ticking!), IndieWire's Ben Travers and Proma Khosla take a closer look at “The Bear” Season 4 and how a potential successor can dig the evolving cooking show out of the two-season rut.

 










Proma Khosla: I can't preface this enough with the fact that I do genuinely enjoy “The Bear.” It's one of those shows that I got into after the rest of the world had been raving about it (including IndieWire dot com), and that can sometimes turn people away from extremely popular shows. I go through some version of it every season as all TV writers steel themselves for The Discourse. (Is it a comedy? Which season is up for Emmys? Does my coworker have screeners and is contractually obligated to lie to me about them?) But then I dive in and I exhale. It's just excellent writing and performance and production, and you love to see that.

You also love to see that go further! We hold good shows to high standards that they set for themselves. Season 2 raised the bar for “The Bear,” and Season 3 felt like I blinked and it was over with no tangible movement. Season 4 felt the same, and I think it's because, as your review noted, we seem to be treading water for 10 episodes while waiting for a character to make one, maybe two key decisions.

Ben Travers: Over the weekend, a disheartening paragraph from an interview with Stripe CEO Patrick Collison was making its way around Bluesky. The featured section saw the A.I. enthusiast complaining that watching “long-form, lots-of-episodes TV is a waste of time,” but there's an easy solution: Just ask your favorite A.I. bot to summarize it for you. That way, you know what happened, and you're spared the inconvenience of feeling anything, forming your own opinions, or connecting with anyone via a medium literally made to bring large swaths of humanity together for a shared collective experience.

 










Now, I don't think “The Bear” quite qualifies as “long-form, lots-of-episodes TV” — there's only 40 episodes, and they're mostly less than 40 minutes apiece — but I do think Collison's anti-human perspective illustrates a pervasive issue in entertainment: prioritizing plot over everything else. “What happens” isn't the basis for great storytelling. It's how it happens, why it happens, and who it's happening to that really matters, that really resonates, that really lends meaning to the headline actions and events. After all, do we love when Kevin Garvey (Justin Theroux) crawls out of the ground in “International Assassin,” or do we love all the insane little steps it takes for him to get to a point where he can crawl out of the ground?

We're living in an age where TV programmers seek out shows the audience only has to half-watch, which tends to negate any potential emotional connection between viewer and story while encouraging an over-dependency on things happening to shock the viewer into paying attention, and “The Bear” is living in that age, too.

All this is by way of explaining I don't take lightly what I'm about to say: “The Bear” lost the plot. Or, if it didn't quite lose it, it's grown too comfortable living without it. Season 4 is the second-half of a two-season arc, and there's no evidence “The Bear” needed two seasons to get from Carmy insisting they change the menu every day (non-negotiable No. 4) to Carmy admitting maybe they don't have to do that, actually. 

 










But more vexing to me than the prolonged character arcs — these are good characters, portrayed through great performances, so they can carry a little extra water — is the show's growing comfort with denying closure. Leaving so much up in the air at the end of Season 3 was annoying and illustrated how little “The Bear” cooked up in those 10 episodes, but at least it had the excuse of “to be continued”; Storer and Calo knew it was a half-season, and admitting as much bought them time to wrap things up in Season 4.

Then… they didn't. Season 4 starts with, as you alluded to, a literal ticking clock. When Computer's digital timer goes off, the restaurant is screwed. That's it. That's the ballgame. The stakes are clear, and the endpoint is even clearer. So why, oh why, does the season end with the timer going off and no actual answer to whether or not Syd (Ayo Edebiri), Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), and Natalie (Abby Elliott) have a restaurant to co-own or not? 

The ending we'll get to a little later, but it's just one example of Season 4's incomplete courses and sweet (maybe saccharine?) vibe shift, so please, Proma, take the mic: What else frustrated you about the latest edition of a show we both very much enjoy? 

Proma: To your point about the characters: I love them and I love spending time with them. I would also love to see them perhaps do something, apart from yelling at each other in various locations and the bare minimum of self-reflection. We both agree that “Worms” was a missed opportunity to let Edebiri really soar (and Danielle Deadwyler — if you have her, you use her!); while she's still delivering a great performance, I just wish it wasn't the fifth time she had to portray Sydney dithering over a big decision that we could all predict from a mile away.

 










Conversely, I was electrified the one scene she shared with Will Poulter as Luca, rekindling a chemistry we saw at the end of Season 3 and which is begging to be explored — but it was once again limited to that single scene. The same goes for sparks between Richie and Jessica (Sarah Ramos), who deserve for their sexually-charged tie-adjusting to lead to something more. Why was Ted (Ricky Staffieri) the romantic hero of the season? I'm happy for him, but even that arc took place entirely off-camera and left the audience with no choice but to just get on board.

This specific qualm I think stems from the larger issue here that was not an issue at first: “The Bear” is not like other shows, certainly not other half-hour shows (comedies). Over the course of four seasons, Calo and Storer have leaned into what their show does best, but it's starting to feel like active rejection of other storytelling techniques that wouldn't necessarily hurt the quality. Allow yourselves a little workplace romance, as a treat! Give us more of the characters' inner lives like with “Napkins,” and use the guest stars to build out more than just the Berzatto-Fak extended universe. 

Ben: After spending five minutes piecing together who “Ted” is based on context clues and a quick Wiki search, I can now wholeheartedly agree with your points before proffering another: The monologuing has to stop.

 










By that, I don't mean “The Bear” has to jettison every lengthy speech or chat the writers pen for their talented cast. I just mean the episodes don't have to wildly vacillate between moody, music-driven montages and concentrated, one-sided conversations. Season 4 has Syd's strained “sleepover” debate with herself in Episode 4; Kate Berlant's opening Al-Anon monologue that builds to a joke you could see coming from the start; Donna (Jamie Lee Curtis) laying it all out there while making amends to her son; Syd's hospital confessional to Claire (Molly Gordon), and Carmy and Claire's confrontation on the stoop — which is technically a hefty piece of dialogue, but when your dialogue sounds like a monologue, that's probably the first sign it needs a good edit. 

Whether there was more monologuing this season than in the past is a question for someone with a better memory than myself, but even if the total was similar, the tone was too lopsided. Nearly all the aforementioned dense talks were delivered with unchecked sincerity, and while Season 4's shift into heartfelt-mode largely worked to its advantage — I love the wedding episode, “Bears,” in part because it's the unabashed bizarro version of “Fishes,” which it invokes at the start before veering in the opposite direction — vulnerability goes a long way in small doses, and “The Bear” gave us heaping spoonful after heaping spoonful.

 










With that, Proma, I have to ask about the ending: After the mixed response to the last two seasons, as well as Carmy's so-called “retirement” in Episode 10, “Goodbye,” there have been plenty of people arguing it's time for “The Bear” to close up shop. Personally, I couldn't disagree more. Too much is left unfinished, and too much is left unresolved. “”Unfinished” goes back to the relationships that have or haven't come to fruition and the fate of the restaurant itself — plot details, if you will — but “unresolved” applies to how much Carmy & Co. have grown, changed, and done right for themselves. 

Richie mocking Carmy for using the phrase “retired” might be the most I've laughed all season, in part because “Good luck, Admiral. We'll send you your watch” is a great quip, but also because I kinda believe him? Carmy may have to leave the restaurant for a while in order to gain perspective, find peace, and move closer to the unattainable goal of a work/life balance, but there's no way one of the top chefs in the world with a deeply personal connection to food is going to simply stop cooking. Nor do I think abandoning his family to start over with Claire (as Carmy obviously intends) is the right thing for a guy who, as Richie says, is constantly running away. 

 










Technically, the finale addresses these complaints, so maybe I just need to shut up and respect people's choices. But we literally don't know whether Richie, Syd, and Natalie have jobs, nor do we know if they'll be happy in their new intended positions at The Bear. Those aren't intentional stopping points. This isn't a series meant to end with that level of ambiguity, and it's also not a series that has to punt on a legitimate series finale just because it delivered another dissatisfying season finale. 

“The Bear” may be headed toward an ending, but it's not there yet. Tell me I'm wrong? 

Proma: Listen when you're right, you're right — and I'm not just saying that so that Luca and Sydney can kiss (not entirely). When pitching a series, creators are asked about the overall arc of the story and what future seasons might look like. I can't imagine these very talented writers went into those meetings waxing about ownership agreements and giant clocks. There had to be a vision — if not a map — for where Carmy, Richie, Sydney, and the rest were going, and my hope is that this protracted season is in service of that vision. Carmy's incremental growth is triumphant even as he inches along, and a highlight of Season 4 was seeing just how far Syd and Richie have come since being party to a workplace stabbing in Season 1.

 










So let's not stop there! This is a massive ensemble and while I don't expect everyone to have their story tied up with a bow — excuse me, garnished with an edible flower — nearly everything ended in a place that left us wanting more. 

Yes, Richie and Carm finally talked about their tension and Mikey's funeral, but can't we see how their dynamic shifts? Marcus texted his father and got a “Food & Wine” shoutout, but what does that mean for their relationship, and his place at The Bear moving forward? Is the Michelin star really in the bag, as Episode 3's snowy climax would suggest? Ebraheim (Edwin Lee Gibson) is going to franchise the Beef window, but can't we see how it does? And is Tina going to get a medal for winning the pasta Olympics? Voracious viewers need to know!

There's a difference between leaving something open-ended and ostensibly giving up on resolution, and Season 4's individual endings fall scattered across this spectrum. So despite having too much of “The Bear,” I hope we get more of “The Bear.” Maybe I'm just not ready to say goodbye, and if I've learned anything from this show it's that you often don't get to — not on your own terms and not neatly. But TV creates chances we don't get in life, and these characters deserve a final course for the ages.

 










And also Luca and Sydney should kiss.

“The Bear” is now streaming on Hulu.
