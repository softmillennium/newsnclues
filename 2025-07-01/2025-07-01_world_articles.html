                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meanwhile, Israel's war on Gaza has killed at least 56,000 Palestinians, with daily violence only increasing. Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! This comes after nearly 21 months of Israel's war on Gaza that has killed at least 56,000 Palestinians, with daily violence only increasing. “There's basically an airstrike every other minute,” says Palestinian writer and analyst Muhammad Shehada. “There's nonstop artillery fire, gunfire, machine gunfire, as well as Israeli quadcopter drones that are swarming Gaza and shooting people at random.” While there have been news reports of a possible ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, Shehada says “there are no negotiations,” and therefore no end in sight to the daily bloodshed. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced he'll be coming to the U.S. next week to meet with President Trump and other officials in the administration. There will also be meetings with congressional and Senate leaders and security meetings, which I will not elaborate on here. These matters follow the great victory we achieved in Operation Am Kalavi. Capitalizing on success is no less important than achieving it. AMY GOODMAN: Will Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, be talking also about Gaza? We're joined now by Muhammad Shehada, a writer and analyst from Gaza, visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. Thanks so much for being with us, Muhammad. Many have said that Israel's attack on Iran, that part of it was to distract from what's happening in Gaza, the intensification of the violence. Can you talk about what's happening there on the West Bank? MUHAMMAD SHEHADA: Thanks so much, Amy, for having me. Yes, precisely, I was in Brussels right before the Israeli attack on Iran, and Gaza became a very prominent headline there. There was so much momentum that European leaders couldn't escape away from it. And as soon as the attack on Iran happened, you can see them immediately having a giant moment of relief. Right now the situation there, you basically have Israel having lined up the entire population like ducks in less than a fifth of Gaza's area. And basically, Israel is asking them to evacuate to the very areas that have been evacuated already, to an area that is already under an evacuation order, Deir al-Balah and Zawayda. And basically, recently an Israeli officer called an elderly Gazan, and he said, “You have to evacuate now. We're issuing mass evacuation orders for your area.” The old man responded with tears in his eyes, and he said, “Go ahead. He said, “If you're going to send planes here anyways, just let them drop any food on us so that we can get any energy to move from this area.” And he started to plead with the officer and saying that “I was a worker in Israel. A lot of the people here around me used to work in your country. We built your country from scratch.” And none of this worked. There's nonstop artillery fire, gunfire, machine gunfire, as well as Israeli quadcopter drones that are swarming Gaza and shooting people at random, in addition to what you see now with the rampant starvation. A single bag of wheat flour costs about 50 U.S. dollars. And Israel allows a maximum of what would be the equivalent — in the GHF sites, it's 20 trucks per day, which is the equivalent of four ounces of food, 125 grams of food per person per day, as the only thing. It's now basically etched in the minds of everyone I know in Gaza that trying to find food is synonymous to death, especially for kids. So, my close friend Ibrahim in Gaza City right now, he told me that whenever he tries to leave home to go look for food, his son starts to scream and kick and cry, because he understands that leaving to try to find food is a death sentence, and he would rather that they starve than finding his own family being killed. But nonetheless, and that's the most depraved part of it, Amy, is that my friends and family on the ground tell me that once the starvation gets too severe, it dulls your senses. The chances of survival, they are very slim. So, the overall picture is just a genocide. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Muhammad Shehada, this carnage, this genocide, is occurring while here in the United States the Trump administration yesterday approved $510 million in additional arms sales to Israel. MUHAMMAD SHEHADA: Well, basically, at this rate, anyone that wants to know knows what's going on. You have a record number of Israeli experts, human rights experts, that are saying this is a genocide unfolding in Gaza. And Trump's only response has been twofold, to keep showering Israel with gifts, with weaponry, and at the same time to pretend that there is sort of, quote, “a breakthrough,” an imminent breakthrough, in the ceasefire negotiations. Hamas, as well, said there is no one — nobody is reaching out to us to ask for negotiating a ceasefire or the release of Israeli captives. There is just the mirage, the facade of negotiations that Netanyahu and Trump keep reviving every time Gaza jumps back to the headlines, as to numb, to suppress any coverage of Gaza, to create some false hope that there is a breakthrough, to sort of circumvent or suppress any room for pressure on Israel. And the picture is not any better in Europe. Like, if you look at European sort of escalating rhetoric towards Israel, it was also an empty maneuver to just circumvent pressure to act. So, for example, European governments, like Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Australia and Norway — Western governments, they basically recently imposed sanctions on Ben-Gvir and Smotrich. They only penalize the two ministers for statements, not actions, and for statements on the West Bank, not Gaza, because if they had looked into actions or statements on Gaza, it would have incriminated the entire Israeli government. So, what we see is basically just mere headline-grabbing gestures that are there to buy time, while at the same time continuing to funnel unrestricted, unconstrained support for the very genocide that those countries are claiming to be concerned about. AMY GOODMAN: Muhammad Shehada, we want to thank you for joining us from Copenhagen, writer and analyst from Gaza, visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. This news from Al Jazeera: Britain's High Court has ruled the government's decision to allow the export of Lockheed Martin F-35 jet parts to Israel is lawful, despite accepting that they could be used in breach of international humanitarian law. He says Israel is committing ethnic cleansing in Gaza. Under pressure from an array of McCarthyist anti-speech tactics, independent journalists at Truthout face new and mounting political repression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge has ruled that recent mass layoffs at the US Department of Health and Human Services were likely unlawful and ordered the Trump administration to halt plans to downsize and reorganize the nation's health workforce. US District Judge Melissa DuBose granted the preliminary injunction sought by a coalition of attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit filed in early May. DuBose said the states had shown “irreparable harm,” from the cuts and were likely to prevail in their claims that “HHS's action was both arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary to law.” “The executive branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,” DuBose wrote in a 58-page order handed down in US District Court in Providence, Rhode Island, on Tuesday. Her order blocks the Trump administration from finalizing layoffs announced in March or issuing any further firings. HHS is directed to file a status report by July 11. The ruling applies to terminated employees in four divisions of HHS: the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Center for Tobacco Products within the Food and Drug Administration; the Office of Head Start within the Administration for Children and Families and employees of regional offices who work on Head Start matters; and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. eliminated more than 10,000 employees in late March and consolidated 28 agencies to 15. Since then, agencies including the CDC have repeatedly rescinded layoffs affecting hundreds of employees, including in branches that monitor HIV, hepatitis and other diseases. The lawsuit also says that the action decimated essential programs and pushed burdensome costs onto states. The cuts are part of a federal “Make America Healthy Again” directive to streamline costly agencies and reduce redundancies. Kennedy told senators at a May 14 hearing that there is “so much chaos and disorganization” at HHS. But the restructuring had eliminated key teams that regulate food safety and drugs, as well as support a wide range of programs for tobacco, HIV prevention and maternal and infant health.</p>

UN human rights expert Francesca Albanese has released a report naming dozens of companies that bear complicity in Israel's genocide and apartheid in Palestine, aiming to show how companies have built Israel's occupation into a sprawling, profitable industry. In her report released Monday, Albanese names over 60 companies, including numerous U.S.-based companies, for their role in advancing Israel's military campaign, settlement building, and mass forced displacement. Big Tech is especially involved, with Albanese calling out some of the largest tech companies in the U.S. for providing logistical support for Israel, like Amazon and Alphabet, Google's parent company. Albanese writes that she received hundreds of submissions, and has built a database of 1,000 corporate entities who are “implicated in human rights violations and international crimes in the occupied Palestinian territory,” she writes. These submissions build upon a previously established database of business enterprises linked to Israeli settlements gathered by the UN human rights office, which was last updated in June 2023, prior to the Gaza genocide. Albanese directly names just a few dozen of these companies in her report, representing some of the companies most entrenched in Israel's genocide and apartheid industry. “Business continues as usual, but nothing about this system, in which businesses are integral, is neutral.” Below is a list of the U.S. companies mentioned by Albanese in the report, representing a non-exhaustive list of U.S. firms with involvement in Israel's atrocities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani takes selfies with supporters on Wednesday.Heather Khalifa/The Associated Press Zohran Mamdani has won New York's Democratic mayoral primary, a new vote count confirmed Tuesday, cementing his stunning upset of former governor Andrew Cuomo and sending him to the general election. “I am humbled by the support of more than 545,000 New Yorkers who voted for our campaign and am excited to expand this coalition even further as we defeat Eric Adams and win a city government that puts working people first.” How Zohran Mamdani, a critic of Israel, excelled among Democrats in America's most Jewish city Mamdani, who declared victory the night of the June 24 primary, will face a general election field that includes incumbent Mayor Eric Adams as well as independent candidate Jim Walden and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Cuomo conceded defeat just hours after the polls closed last week but is contemplating whether to run in the general election on an independent ballot line. After the release of Tuesday's vote count, Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi said “We'll be continuing conversations with people from all across the city while determining next steps.” “Extremism, division and empty promises are not the answer to this city's problems, and while this was a look at what motivates a slice of our primary electorate, it does not represent the majority,” Azzopardi said. “The financial instability of our families is the priority here, which is why actionable solutions, results and outcomes matter so much.” Explainer: Who is Zohran Mamdani, the state lawmaker seeking to become New York's first Muslim mayor? Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist and member of the state Assembly, was virtually unknown when he launched his candidacy centred on a bold slate of populist ideas. But he built an energetic campaign that ran circles around Cuomo as the older, more moderate Democrat tried to come back from the sexual harassment scandal that led to his resignation four years ago. Mamdani's campaign, which was focused on lowering the cost of living, claims it has found a new blueprint for Democrats who have at times appeared rudderless during President Donald Trump's climb back to power. Many of its big players applauded his campaign but don't seem ready to throw their full support behind the young progressive, whose past criticisms of law enforcement, use of the word “genocide” to describe the Israeli government's actions in Gaza and “democratic socialist” label amount to landmines for some in the party. Trump and others in the GOP have begun to launch broadsides at him, moving to cast Mamdani as the epitome of leftist excess ahead of consequential elections elsewhere this year and next. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that if New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani interferes with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, then 'we'll have to arrest him.' “If I'm a Republican, I want this guy to win,” said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University. New York City's ranked choice voting model allows voters to list up to five candidates on their ballots in order of preference. If a single candidate is the first choice of more than 50% of voters, then that person wins the race outright. His campaign promised free city buses, free child care, a rent freeze for people living in rent-stabilized apartment, government-run grocery stores and more, all paid for with taxes on the wealthy. Mamdani's energetic campaign centered on lowering the city's cost of living. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Joe Biden nominated her on grounds of identity politics. In January 2022, one year after Joe Biden assumed the White House, Justice Stephen Breyer of the US Supreme Court announced his impending retirement. Biden, who had selected the intellectually challenged Kamala Harris as his running mate two years prior, in large part on diversity grounds, sprang into action to fulfil a campaign promise to black political kingmaker Rep Jim Clyburn (D-SC) – that he would select a black woman for his first Supreme Court pick. And so the Biden White House foisted upon us Ketanji Brown Jackson – a hitherto obscure jurist, nominated because of her sex and race, but who ironically refused to provide a definition of the word “woman” when asked about it at her US Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing. Alas, it has only been downhill from that rockiest of rocky starts. I pondered, at the time of Jackson's nomination, how a justice who knows she was selected on the basis of identity politics could be expected to fairly adjudicate cases that involve issues of race and sex? Barely a year after her nomination, Justice Clarence Thomas – the Court's longest-serving member, who also happens to be black – excoriated Jackson's “myopia” in his concurring opinion in Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) v Harvard, which ended the systemic racism of “affirmative action” in university admissions: “Justice Jackson's race-infused world view falls flat at each step. Individuals are the sum of their unique experiences, challenges, and accomplishments. A contrary, myopic world view based on individuals' skin colour to the total exclusion of their personal choices is nothing short of racial determinism.” As part of her SFFA dissent, notably, Jackson also made a “mathematically absurd” claim about black infant mortality. Yet as satisfying as Thomas's defenestration of Jackson in his SFFA concurrence was, Friday's fusillade from Justice Amy Coney Barrett in her majority opinion in Trump v CASA, a case addressing the contentious debate over the legitimacy of so-called nationwide injunctions, was if anything even more fulfilling. “We will not dwell on Justice Jackson's argument, which is at odds with more than two centuries' worth of precedent, not to mention the Constitution itself,” Barrett wrote. What's more, Jackson “chooses a starting line of attack that is tethered neither to [historical] sources nor, frankly, to any doctrine whatsoever”. And “among its many problems, Justice Jackson's view is at odds with our system of divided judicial authority”. Perhaps most bitingly, Barrett mocked Jackson's glossing over the all-important inquiry as to the historical “limits on judicial authority” as mere “legalese” (Jackson's own ignominious word choice). Notably, all six of the Court's Republican-nominated justices, including the ever-mercurial chief justice, John Roberts, signed onto Barrett's opinion in full. One cannot help but get the sense that Barrett, the normally mild-mannered former law professor and mother of seven, really just wanted to say: “Justice Jackson is unfit to serve on this Court.” And maybe she should have done so. But the fact she now routinely produces such intellectually indefensible balderdash that she is roundly mocked by her more senior colleagues, takes the level of offence to a different level. Simply put, serious countries do not elevate arguably unqualified dimwits to public positions of extraordinary prominence. The America that just sent B-2 bombers to drop 14 “bunker buster” bombs on Iran's nuclear facilities is a serious place. The America that counts Ketanji Brown Jackson as a Supreme Court justice? Frankly, no one should be more offended at this appalling DEI idiocy than Jackson's fellow black women. Because Jackson was nominated explicitly due to the fact she is a black woman.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Portugal and Spain suffer historic temperature highs for June, as French schools close because of heat Outdoor working has been banned during the hottest parts of the day in more than half of Italy's regions as an extreme heatwave that has smashed June temperature records in Spain and Portugal continues to grip large swathes of Europe. The savage temperatures are believed to have claimed at least three lives, including that of a small boy who is thought to have died from heatstroke while in a car in Catalonia's Tarragona province on Tuesday afternoon. The majority of patients are elderly people suffering from dehydration. In Brussels, the Atomium monument, famed for its giant stainless steel balls, closed early as temperatures inched towards 37C. Local authorities were heeding advice from trade unions after the death of Brahim Ait El Hajjam, a 47-year-old construction worker, who collapsed and died while working on a building site close to Bologna, the capital of Emilia-Romagna, on Monday. The CGIL Bologna and Fillea CGIL unions said in a statement: “While we wait to learn the actual cause of death, it is essential, during this terrible period, to promote a culture of safety. The French national rail operator SNCF said train travel between France and Italy had been suspended for “at least several days” after violent storms on Monday, AFP reported. Cogne, a town in Italy's Aosta Valley that suffered severe flooding in June last year, has been cut off by a landslide. The Spanish state meteorological agency, Aemet, said in a social media update that “June 2025 smashed records” when it came to high temperature, with an average temperature of 23.6C, 0.8C above the previous hottest June in 2017. The agency's comments come just days after Spain's highest ever June temperature of 46C was recorded in the Huelva province of Andalucía. More than 1,896 schools across the country were fully or partially closed on Tuesday. In Paris, which was on maximum heatwave alert, parents were advised to keep their children at home on Tuesday and Wednesday. Some other towns, including Troyes and Melun, closed all their schools. Bayrou said the education ministry would open talks with mayors on how to adapt school buildings, most of which are extremely poorly insulated. As temperatures rose on Tuesday, some Paris teachers had nothing more than a water spray on their desk to repeatedly spritz children in classrooms in the hope of keeping cool. Bayrou, who is facing a vote of no confidence on Tuesday, which he is expected to survive, has cancelled his meetings to monitor the situation in real time. Industry groups warned that schools, elderly care homes and hospitals were ill-prepared for the heatwave – an urgent issue they said must be addressed as the frequency of life-threatening weather increases. Other cities across Europe are also experiencing higher than usual temperatures, including Zaragoza (39C), Rome (37C), Madrid (37C), Athens (37C), Brussels (36C), Frankfurt (36C), Tirana (35C) and London (33C). Turkey's forestry minister, İbrahim Yumaklı, said firefighters had been called out to 263 wildfires across the country in recent days.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Senate has voted nearly unanimously to remove a 10-year moratorium on the enforcement of state artificial intelligence regulations from Republicans' sweeping domestic policy bill. The provision in the Senate bill would have effectively prevented states from enforcing many proposed and existing AI-related laws — including regulations around sexually explicit and political deepfakes — for the next decade. Earlier this month, Senate Commerce Committee Republicans had moved to tie compliance with the moratorium to crucial federal funds for deploying internet infrastructure. While some tech leaders have advocated for a single federal law rather than a patchwork of state regulations, the moratorium had raised alarms among other tech workers and leaders, academics, advocacy groups, state regulators and lawmakers. Opponents of the provision worried that it could hamstring efforts to hold tech companies accountable for potential harms to society, especially in light of the fact that there is currently no comprehensive federal legislation regulating AI. Ed Markey, Maria Cantwell and Marsha Blackburn. Related article State regulator: Proposed 10-year moratorium on AI law enforcement is ‘extremely disconcerting' “This 99-1 vote sent a clear message that Congress will not sell out our kids and local communities in order to pad the pockets of Big Tech billionaires,” Markey said in a statement, adding, “I look forward to working with my colleagues to develop responsible guardrails for AI.” At least one House lawmaker, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, had warned that she would vote “no” on the agenda bill if the Senate did not remove the AI moratorium provision. “State legislatures all across the country have done critical bipartisan work to protect the American people from some of the most dangerous harms of AI technology,” Ilana Beller, democracy organizing manager at the progressive consumer advocacy group Public Citizen said in a statement. “The defeat of this moratorium will mean vital protections remain in place for millions of Americans.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lead of Chrisley Knows Best said he didn't ‘have an apology to give' in interview after release from prison “I don't have an apology to give you or anyone else over the money that I've made,” Todd Chrisley said in an interview with ABC News that was posted online on Monday. And, as his family begins planning to return to television with a new reality show on Lifetime, he said “it doesn't matter what someone else's opinion” of him is. “No one's opinion of me has ever caused me to question who I am at the core,” the former co-star of Chrisley Knows Best said to ABC News. “So I don't worry about someone else's opinion.” Chrisley Knows Best aired on USA Network from 2014 to 2023, depicting Todd as a wealthy real estate developer and entrepreneur who was raising a family with Julie in their suburban Atlanta mansion. Trump then pardoned Todd and Julie on 27 May, a little more than four months after he was sworn back into the Oval Office. The Chrisleys' pardons freed them from prison after serving less than three years. Their pardons came amid a series of clemencies that Trump gave to supporters in what evidently was a broader rebuke against a justice system that had convicted him of criminally falsifying business records months before he retook the White House. Some particularly criticized the Chrisleys' pardons because an appeals court had upheld their jury convictions. Julie recounted to the network that she had made some everlasting friendships while incarcerated. Yet, unsurprisingly, Todd said he and his wife were relieved to be out of prison early as they weigh whether to move to South Carolina and film themselves converting a mansion into a hotel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US president warns Tesla billionaire that he would have to ‘close up shop' without federal support for businesses Donald Trump said he would “take a look” at deporting Elon Musk after the billionaire Tesla boss reignited their bitter feud. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Mr Trump said his former ally was urging Republicans to vote against his tax and spending bill because he is upset about “losing his EV (electric vehicle) mandate”, adding that Mr Musk could “lose a lot more” than government subsidies afforded to Tesla. The president had said earlier on Truth Social that Mr Musk would be forced to “close up shop and head back to South Africa” if he loses US government contracts. The war of words came after Mr Musk intensified his criticism of Mr Trump's so-called “big, beautiful bill”, which pledges to slash taxes for the rich, make sweeping cuts to welfare programmes such as Medicaid, and remove incentives for Americans to buy electric cars. Posting on X, Mr Musk said he would make it his mission to oust Republican senators who vote in favour of the legislation. The 54-year-old also threatened to put their faces on a poster, accusing them of being a “liar” and of “voting to increase America's debt” by $5 trillion. It is ridiculous, and was always a major part of my campaign,” Mr Trump wrote. He said that Mr Musk “may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far”, and that he would “probably have to head back home to South Africa” with them. “No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE. Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? “The monster that might have to go back and eat Elon. At the time, Mr Musk also threatened to form a rival political party, before later apologising. That earlier dispute was also rooted in opposition to Mr Trump's “big, beautiful bill”, which will reverse a mandate that gave Americans an electric vehicle tax credit of up to $7,500, benefiting companies including Tesla. Mr Trump claimed last month that Mr Musk was “upset because we took the EV mandate – which, you know, was a lot of money for electric vehicles... Mr Musk is understood to have spent at least $250 million supporting Mr Trump's re-election campaign, and was later appointed to lead the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, which made headlines after sacking around 120,000 federal employees. He said: “How can you call yourself the Freedom Caucus if you vote for a DEBT SLAVERY bill with the biggest debt ceiling increase in history?”</p>

Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) released on July 1 video footage showing domestically produced drones striking multiple Russian air defense assets and a fighter jet in occupied Crimea in what it described as a successful special operation.

The undated footage shows the combat use of UJ-26 drones, commonly known as Bober (Beavers), targeting high-value Russian military systems.

"These reliable weapons in the hands of HUR special forces are turning critically important Russian targets into useless scrap," the agency said in a statement. 

HUR added that the Bober drones are effectively "gnawing through" Russia's expensive air defense systems "like barberries."

The released footage shows that the strikes destroyed or severely damaged several Russian military assets, including a Pantsir-S1 air defense system and its crew, a Niobium-SV radar, a Pechora-3 coastal radar, a Protivnik-GE radar, and a Su-30 fighter jet stationed at the Saky airfield in occupied Crimea. 

The Kyiv Independent could not verify HUR's claims.

The strikes are part of Ukraine's ongoing efforts to degrade Russian military capabilities in Crimea, which has been under Russian occupation since 2014. Moscow reported Ukrainian drone strikes against the peninsula earlier on July 1, with the Crimean Wind Telegram channel reporting attacks in the vicinity of S-300/S-400 air defense systems.

Ukraine has increasingly deployed new drone systems to target Russian military assets on the front line and deep inside the Russian rear.

Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on July 1 that he had ordered a ban on the concentration of troops and equipment at training facilities to better protect against Russian missile attacks.

"My categorical order is to ensure and increase the safety of service members at training centers and training grounds," Syrskyi said on social media after listening to reports on the implementation of safety measures.

"The concentration of personnel and military equipment, as well as the placement of service members in tent camps, is prohibited!"

The command follows a string of Russian missile attacks against Ukrainian military training facilities that have resulted in a number of killed and injured service members.

Deadly strikes deep inside the Ukrainian rear have sparked a public backlash and increased scrutiny aimed at the military command. 

Former Ground Forces Commander Mykhailo Drapatyi promised to address the issue, but resigned after another attack against a shooting range in Sumy Oblast on May 20, which killed six soldiers and injured a dozen more.

Syrskyi said that new shelters and protective structures are being constructed at training facilities.

"I emphasized the mandatory compliance with shelter requirements at training centers and ranges, as well as the proper and timely notification of air raid alerts."

In a most recently reported case, a Russian missile attack killed three soldiers and injured 14 at the training ground of a Ukrainian mechanized brigade on June 22.</p>

MOSCOW, July 1. /TASS/. The Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) has placed prominent Russian film director and actor Nikita Mikhalkov on the wanted list.

According to the agency's database, Mikhalkov has been designated as wanted since March 2022. Also, Mikhalkov has been added to the database of Ukraine's Mirotvorets extremist website.

The SBU regularly files accusations in absentia against Russian politicians, military men, cultural figures, and public activists. Apart from that, Vladimir Zelensky has signed numerous orders imposing sanctions on Russian individuals and legal entities as well as citizens of other countries accused of cooperation with Russia by Kiev.

The notorious Mirotvorets (Peacekeeper) website, launched in 2014, illegally collects and publishes personal data of journalists, artists, politicians, and others who have visited Crimea or Donbass, or who have drawn criticism from the site's administrators. Access to the site is blocked in Russia by court order.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Michael Carpenter is a Distinguished Fellow at the Atlantic Council. Although few analysts believed that specific promise, many speculated about the possible terms and timeline of an impending deal. The investment bank JPMorgan Chase, for example, claimed an agreement could be reached by June. As Ukraine's former Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba noted in Foreign Affairs in late May, neither Russia nor Ukraine “has much of an incentive to stop the fighting.” Ukraine refuses to surrender its sovereignty; Russia will not accept anything less than Ukrainian capitulation. This conclusion, however, does not mean all is lost. Russia is much weaker economically than many analysts realize, and hard-hitting sanctions and export controls can still cripple its war economy. Ukraine is fighting smartly and could turn the tide on the battlefield with more high-end drones, air defense systems, long-range missiles, and munitions. Much of the premature optimism about a settlement earlier this year sprang from the prevailing belief that Ukraine was losing and would soon be forced to negotiate out of desperation. Trump stoked this narrative by asserting that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had “no cards” left to play. U.S. Vice President JD Vance took it a step further, declaring that Ukraine—and its foreign backers—never had any “pathway to victory.” Citing Russia's superiority in manpower and weapons, Vance argued that if the United States kept up its security assistance, it would only postpone Ukraine's inevitable defeat. This defeatism has been supported by a second, equally pernicious assumption: that Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to subjugating Ukraine cannot be deterred. By assigning no agency to Ukraine or its foreign partners, it presumes that Ukrainian victory is a fantasy born of Western delusion, and it is a view that risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Both assumptions, meanwhile, rest on an excessively narrow reading of battlefield dynamics and a limited understanding of the policy options available to Ukraine's backers. It repelled Russia's initial push toward Kyiv in March 2022 with little more than shoulder-fired antitank missiles and grit, defying the predictions of many military analysts. Later that year, in a stunning rout for Russian forces, Ukraine reclaimed nearly a thousand square miles in the Kharkiv region without the benefit of modern armor or air cover. And just weeks ago, Ukraine shocked the world by pulling off Operation Spiderweb, a surprise attack that used cheap, remote-controlled drones to inflict substantial damage on Russia's long-range aviation. Indeed, what most consistently hindered Ukraine's war effort was not Kyiv's lack of manpower or weak resolve compared with Putin, but rather an insufficient supply of advanced military capabilities. Long after Russia had deployed its most modern tanks, fifth-generation fighter aircraft, long-range air defense systems, and cutting-edge ballistic and cruise missiles, Ukraine was still waiting for deliveries of similar capabilities from its Western partners. When some of these systems finally did arrive, Ukraine was prohibited from using them on targets inside Russia until the United States relaxed its rules of engagement in mid-2024. Instead of prolonging the war by giving Ukraine too much military assistance, Kyiv's foreign allies have prolonged it by giving too little, and often with significant delays. When it comes to punitive economic measures against Russia, the international response has been similarly half-baked. In the early days of the war, the United States and its G-7 allies crafted sanctions and export controls that were thought to pack a powerful punch but in fact had so many mitigations built in that they were robbed of their full impact. The gradual implementation of export controls also gave Russia time to adapt, as did numerous carve-outs for certain types of Russian banks or transactions: civil nuclear energy, aviation servicing and maintenance, and fertilizer sales, for example, could still be processed. Despite these missteps, victory for Ukraine—minimally defined as preserving its sovereignty and continuing to chart a course toward NATO and EU membership—is still squarely within reach. Achieving it, however, requires a fundamental shift in Western strategy, one that combines a large boost in military assistance with more robust economic measures to constrain Russia's war economy. So, as Wally Adeyemo and David Shimer have written in Foreign Affairs, it makes sense to seize these assets and, in effect, “make Russia pay” for Ukraine's defense. Some EU leaders have argued that these assets should be saved for reconstruction efforts after the war ends. Others worry about setting a dangerous precedent for the rule of law by seizing a country's funds—even if that country has violated international laws and is engaged in the mass murder of civilians. A portion could be invested in Ukraine's burgeoning defense industrial base: its drone sector, for instance, has become highly innovative but needs additional investments for industrial-scale production, sensor development, and counter-electronic warfare measures. Another portion could help Ukraine purchase long-range missiles and other weapons systems from Europe, assisting the continent in building up production lines that support both Ukraine's defense and, once the war is over, NATO deterrence. A third chunk could fund the production of U.S.-made capabilities—such as air defense systems and long-range precision fires—that Ukraine needs but Europe currently lacks in sufficient quantities. Yet helping Ukraine win requires more than just transferring arms. Such arrangements would reduce Ukraine's dependence on foreign supply chains, fortify its domestic capacity, and foster long-term interoperability with NATO forces. Despite being outnumbered, Ukraine has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to offset its disadvantages with asymmetric tactics, such as sinking parts of Russia's Black Sea Fleet with maritime drones and missiles and denying Russia air superiority by using its limited air defenses creatively. Although the country's GDP has increased over the last two years, structural weaknesses abound in its economy: a 20 percent interest rate, a 68 percent decline in Russia's sovereign wealth fund since February 2022, and persistent inflation of around nine percent. First, the West must go after Russia's primary revenue stream: energy exports. Currently, Europe is still importing roughly $23.5 billion worth of Russian oil and natural gas. If Europe is to get serious about ending the war, it must decrease Moscow's energy income and foreign currency flows. Moreover, Russia has systematically evaded the G-7's oil price cap, significantly weakening its intended impact. Western countries should impose a full embargo or steep tariffs on Russian oil and gas and should tighten regulations, engage in more systematic maritime tracking, and take stronger legal measures to strictly enforce the G-7 price cap. And if third parties flout these restrictions, the G-7 should impose sanctions on them. To meaningfully disrupt Russia's trade, devalue the ruble, and increase economic uncertainty, the G-7 should remove all Russian banks from SWIFT and subject them to full blocking sanctions, which prohibit all transactions with the sanctioned entity. Only by applying the full power of these sanctions tools can Ukraine's allies succeed in weakening Russia's war machine. Western governments can also redouble their efforts regarding export controls on high-tech components, including semiconductors, precision machine tools, optics, aviation components, and industrial software. There have been export controls on Russia for more than a decade, but these are not one-and-done solutions; meaningfully degrading the Kremlin's capacity to replenish and maintain its military equipment requires continuous enforcement whenever workarounds and third-party cutouts arise. The U.S. Commerce Department should further restrict Russia's access to “dual use” goods—products valuable in both civilian and military applications—in order to constrain its production of high-tech weapons and undermine its military-industrial complex. Similarly, Western governments can do more to zero in on Russia's defense industry by sanctioning more Russian firms that manufacture essential defense equipment such as drones, missiles, and armored vehicles. Even after three and half years of full-scale war, Ukraine's supporters have not come close to exhausting the sanctions toolkit. If rigorously applied and internationally enforced, the combination of these sanction enhancements would cripple Russia's economy. It has found steady backing from a coalition of autocratic states—backing that has allowed it to weather the bite of Western sanctions and replenish critical materiel. Only a few months into the war, Western intelligence agencies and military analysts had assessed that Russia had significantly depleted its stockpile of precision-guided munitions. As sanctions took hold and component shortages mounted, the Kremlin was forced to ration these weapons. By the fall of that year, however, Iran began supplying Russia with drones. North Korea, meanwhile, provided short-range ballistic missiles and, later, troops. Confronting this axis of aggressors will require a shift in Western strategy. There is probably little Europe or the United States can do to dissuade North Korea, but Iran has been greatly weakened following its war with Israel and has less to offer now that Russia is mass-producing its own drones. That leaves China, whose inputs into the Russian defense industrial base are far more consequential than Iran's or North Korea's contributions. That means leveraging trade and market access—areas in which Europe holds unique influence—to apply pressure. European leaders acknowledge China's key role in enabling the Russian war effort, but they have not taken serious steps to stop it; mere expressions of disapproval are not enough. If the war in Ukraine is to be contained and ultimately resolved, Europe will have to make clear to Beijing that normal commercial relations cannot coexist with China's support for a war against the European security order. What can change are the battlefield and defense-industrial conditions that make Putin's ambition feasible. Western countries have the collective resources to create a situation in which trend lines turn negative for Russia. Indeed, from a strategic vantage point, Russia has already lost this war. Regardless of how much additional territory changes hands, the Ukrainian nation is lost to Russia forever. No matter how many billions of dollars Moscow spends on propaganda and “reeducation,” filtration camps and torture chambers, it will never convince Ukrainians to accept its rule as legitimate. What Ukraine needs now is the time, tools, and space to prove to the Kremlin that an occupation is not just immoral but incompatible with Russia's long-term security needs. A peace agreement may forever remain elusive, but once the cost of continued fighting becomes untenable, Russia can eventually be forced to settle for an armistice similar to the one that effectively ended the Korean War.
