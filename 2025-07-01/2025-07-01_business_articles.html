                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge on Tuesday blocked the Trump administration from moving forward with plans to overhaul the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services by reorganizing several of its agencies and substantially cutting their workforce. U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose in Providence, Rhode Island, issued an injunction at the behest of a group of Democratic-led states who challenged a plan HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in March to consolidate agencies and fire 10,000 of the department's employees. The layoffs, in addition to earlier buyout offers and firings of probationary employees, reduced the number of full-time HHS employees to 62,000 from 82,000 and left key offices unable to perform statutory functions, the states alleged. The 19 states that sued, along with the District of Columbia, challenged HHS' implementation of its restructuring plan, which also called for collapsing 28 divisions into 15 and closing half of its 10 regional offices. While the states argued that the entire plan was unlawful, they focused on having DuBose block firings and restructurings at four agencies within HHS, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Office of Head Start. DuBose, an appointee of Democratic President Joe Biden, agreed to do so, saying the states had established a likelihood of proving HHS' action was arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary to law. She ordered HHS to halt mass job cuts and restructurings at the four agencies, which also included the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Center for Tobacco Products and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. "Today's order guarantees these programs and services will remain accessible and halts the administration's attempt to sabotage our nation's health care system," New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, said in a statement. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said it strongly disagreed with the ruling and stands by its decision to "refocus a sprawling bureaucracy that, over time, had become wasteful, inefficient, and resistant to change." Some of the 10,000 employees had already been reinstated following an outcry over the potential for increased risks to public health. Democratic state attorneys general in a lawsuit filed in May argued that the intended effect of the restructuring was to dismantle key HHS programs. They argued that Kennedy lacked the authority to launch the widespread layoffs and restructuring, which have led to infectious disease lab closures, research being abandoned and partnerships suspended. The states said that the cuts left the CDC unable to meet statutory mandates to investigate diseases due to lab closures and put Head Start centers that support early childhood programs at risk of closing.

Deportation Inc.:

On June 20, nearly three weeks into the Atlantic hurricane season, Florida disaster-management officials assembled a group of emergency relief contractors in Tallahassee and asked them to do something they had never done before. 

Governor Ron DeSantis wanted to construct a camp in the Everglades that could hold thousands of immigrants detained in President Donald Trump's deportation campaign. To get it built fast, Kevin Guthrie, the head of the state's emergency-management division, asked the firms to start moving tents, trailers and toilets onto an abandoned airstrip near Miami within days. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Clean energy stocks rose on Tuesday after a tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Shares of NextEra Energy, the largest renewables developer in the U.S., rose about 5% after the Senate narrowly passed President Donald Trump's bill on Tuesday. AES, a leading renewable provider, rose about 2%. The clean energy industry was surprised and outraged to find over the weekend that a tax on wind and solar projects had been inserted into a version of the Senate legislation. The tax applied to projects that use components from foreign entities of concern above a certain threshold. The tax was ultimately struck from the Senate legislation, the American Clean Power Association (ACP) and Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) told CNBC. The measure was punitive and would have added up to $7 billion to the solar and wind industry's tax burden, said John Hensley, ACP's senior vice president for market analysis. The Senate bill still phases out the clean electricity investment and production tax credits for wind and solar, though the timeline isn't quite as strict as previous versions of the legislation. These credits have played a crucial role in the expansion of renewable energy in the U.S. Projects that start construction within 12 months of the bill becoming law can still qualify for full tax credits, according to ACP. Shares of First Solar, the largest solar panel manufacturer in the U.S., slipped more than 1%. Residential solar installer Sunrun more than 10% while inverter manufacturers SolarEdge and Enphase gained about 7% and 3%, respectively. ACP described the bill as "a step backward for American energy policy." "This legislation undermines the very foundation of America's manufacturing comeback and global energy leadership," Abigail Ross Hopper, the CEO of SEIA, said in a statement.

The five-year-old company, known for its bold designs, unveiled the Phone 3 and a pair of similarly quirky headphones.

The Phone 3 is, by design, a weird gadget. A see-through back reveals the printed circuit board inside. And there's a small circular display with retro-style animations — an hourglass, for example, is meant to tell you in the cutest way possible that your Uber is arriving.

It's odd looking, no doubt, but the strangest thing about it is that it's designed to be used less than other phones.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk and Donald Trump are not done fighting over the president's "Big Beautiful Bill." Musk started criticizing Trump's spending bill on June 5 but walked back the attacks just days later. But the argument is heating up again, with Trump suggesting the cost-cutting DOGE, which Musk previously led, would now be turned to focus on his companies. Tesla stock fell almost 6% in early-hours trading Tuesday as the fight continued. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note that the feud was "a soap opera that remains an overhang on Tesla's stock" as investors fear Trump taking a more hawkish line on Musk's companies. On Saturday, Musk wrote on X that the president's signature tax bill "will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country." GOP lawmakers hope to send the bill, which is pending a vote in the Senate, to Trump's desk by Friday. Musk, however, said he would defeat politicians who voted for the bill if it passed and form his own political party. "It is obvious with the insane spending of this bill, which increases the debt ceiling by a record FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS that we live in a one-party country — the PORKY PIG PARTY!!" Musk wrote in an X post on Monday. "Time for a new political party that actually cares about the people," he said. Musk said in a follow-up post, published just an hour later, that any politician who voted for the bill after campaigning on cutting government spending should "hang their head in shame." "And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth," he added. Trump responded early Tuesday morning with a Truth Social post. "Elon Musk knew, long before he so strongly Endorsed me for President, that I was strongly against the EV Mandate," he said. Trump then suggested getting DOGE to take a "good, hard, look" at Musk's companies. "Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE," he said. Less than an hour later, Musk wrote a series of X posts, doubling down on his opposition to the spending bill. In another post minutes later, Musk added: "All I'm asking is that we don't bankrupt America." He followed up with a question to lawmakers: "What's the point of a debt ceiling if we keep raising it?" At the White House on Tuesday morning, Trump told reporters Musk was "upset" at losing the EV mandate, adding, "he could lose a lot more than that, I can tell you right now." A reporter asked Trump if he would deport Musk. The monster that might have to go back and eat Elon. Musk then said on X, "So tempting to escalate this. After arriving in Florida, Trump told reporters, "DOGE is going to look at Musk. If DOGE looks at Musk, we're going to save a fortune. Musk and the White House did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Televangelist Jimmy Swaggart, whose multimillion-dollar ministry and huge audience dwindled following his prostitution scandals, has died. Swaggart death was announced Tuesday on his public Facebook page. A cause wasn't immediately given, though Swaggart had been in ill health. The Louisiana native was best known for being a captivating Pentecostal preacher with a massive following before being caught on camera with a prostitute in New Orleans in 1988, one of a string of successful TV preachers brought down in the 1980s and '90s by sex scandals. He continued preaching for decades, but with a reduced audience. Swaggart encapsulated his downfall in a tearful 1988 sermon, in which he wept and apologized but made no reference to his connection to a prostitute. "I have sinned against you," Swaggart told parishioners nationwide. He announced his resignation from the Assemblies of God later that year, shortly after the church said it was defrocking him for rejecting punishment it had ordered for "moral failure." The church had wanted him to undergo a two-year rehabilitation program, including not preaching for a full year. Swaggart said at the time that he knew dismissal was inevitable but insisted he had no choice but to separate from the church to save his ministry and Bible college. From poverty and oil fields to a household name The voice gave him goose bumps and made his hair tingle, he said. He then moved entirely into his ministry: preaching, playing piano and singing gospel songs with the barrelhouse fervor of cousin Lewis at Assemblies of God revivals and camp meetings. He called Roman Catholicism "a false religion. "If you don't like what I say, talk to my boss," he once shouted as he strode in front of his congregation at his Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, where his sermons moved listeners to speak in tongues and stand up as if possessed by the Holy Spirit. Swaggart's messages stirred thousands of congregants and millions of TV viewers, making him a household name by the late 1980s. Contributors built Jimmy Swaggart Ministries into a business that made an estimated $142 million in 1986. The scandals that led to Swaggart's ruin Swaggart's downfall came in the late 1980s as other prominent preachers faced similar scandals. Swaggart said publicly that his earnings were hurt in 1987 by the sex scandal surrounding rival televangelist Jim Bakker and a former church secretary at Bakker's PTL ministry organization. The following year, Swaggart was photographed at a hotel with Debra Murphree, an admitted prostitute who told reporters that the two did not have sex but that the preacher had paid her to pose nude. She later repeated the claim — and posed nude — for Penthouse magazine. The surveillance photos that crippled Swaggart's career apparently stemmed from his rivalry with preacher Marvin Gorman, whom Swaggart had accused of sexual misdeeds. Gorman hired the photographer who captured Swaggart and Murphree on film. His companion, Rosemary Garcia, said Swaggart became nervous when he saw the police car and weaved when he tried to stuff pornographic magazines under a car seat. Swaggart was later mocked by the late TV comic Phil Hartman, who impersonated him on NBC's "Saturday Night Live." The evangelist largely stayed out of the news in later years but remained in the pulpit at Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, often joined by his son, Donnie, a fellow preacher. His radio station broadcast church services and gospel music to 21 states, and Swaggart's ministry boasted a worldwide audience on the internet. The preacher caused another brief stir in 2004 with remarks about being "looked at" amorously by a gay man. "And I'm going to be blunt and plain: If one ever looks at me like that, I'm going to kill him and tell God he died," Swaggart said, to laughter from the congregation. Swaggart made few public appearances outside his church, save for singing "Amazing Grace" at the 2005 funeral of Louisiana Secretary of State Fox McKeithen, a prominent name in state politics for decades. In 2022, he shared memories at the memorial service for Lewis, his cousin and rock 'n' roll pioneer. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Workers across the United States are getting a raise this week after minimum wage increases took effect across several states and localities Tuesday. The wage increases are expected to affect more than 880,000 workers this summer as minimum wage laws take effect in areas including Alaska, Oregon, Washington, D.C. and certain cities in California and Washington state, according to a report by The Economic Policy Institute. In Everett, Washington, a city just north of Seattle, companies with more than 500 employees are now required to pay a minimum of $20.24 an hour. In Alaska, the statewide minimum wage is now $13.00 an hour, up from $11.91 — meaning a full-time, year-round worker in Alaska will receive an average annual wage increase of $925, according to the report. Nationally, the federal minimum wage has remained at $7.25 an hour since 2009, but in many areas, state and local governments have enacted higher minimums. A full-time worker in every U.S. county would need to earn at least $17 an hour to afford basic expenses such as housing, food, transportation and health care, according to The Economic Policy Institute's family budget calculator.

Deportation Inc.:

On June 20, nearly three weeks into the Atlantic hurricane season, Florida disaster-management officials assembled a group of emergency relief contractors in Tallahassee and asked them to do something they had never done before. 

Governor Ron DeSantis wanted to construct a camp in the Everglades that could hold thousands of immigrants detained in President Donald Trump's deportation campaign. To get it built fast, Kevin Guthrie, the head of the state's emergency-management division, asked the firms to start moving tents, trailers and toilets onto an abandoned airstrip near Miami within days. </p>

The Ninja website

Saudi Arabia-based quick delivery firm Ninja has become the kingdom's newest tech unicorn after raising around $250 million from local investors, according to people familiar with the matter.

The funding round, led by asset manager Riyad Capital, values the three-year-old company at about $1.5 billion, the people said, asking not named as the information is private. Ninja is targeting an initial public offering by 2027, Bloomberg News reported in March.</p>

US Housing Crisis:

A buildup of unsold houses sitting on the market for weeks is becoming a new reality in once-booming housing areas across the Sun Belt.

Real estate agents in the South and Southwest say they're seeing more people list homes, giving up on hopes that mortgage rates will drop anytime soon. In Florida, homeowners are fleeing soaring insurance costs, and in Colorado, investors are culling rental properties.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cloudflare announced a major policy shift that could reshape the dynamics between content creators and AI companies. This makes Cloudflare the first major internet infrastructure provider to enforce a default permission-based model for AI content access. The move comes amid growing concerns from content creators and publishers that AI giants are exploiting their work without consent or compensation. Historically, search engines have indexed content in a way that drives traffic and ad revenue back to original sources. But AI bot crawlers, used for training large language models, harvest vast amounts of data and send much less traffic back to the original creators of this content. These bots are used by industry giants including Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Cloudflare, which manages and protects traffic for about 20% of the web, initially rolled out an optional one-click AI crawler blocking system in 2024. Now, this becomes the default: AI companies will now be required to obtain explicit permission from websites before scraping, flipping the script on passive data harvesting. "AI crawlers have been scraping content without limits," he added. As part of its broader push toward a permission-based internet, Cloudflare also rolled out Pay Per Crawl on Tuesday. This new feature lets select publishers and creators charge AI companies for accessing their content. Participants can set pricing for individual crawlers, granting full control over how and whether their work is used in AI model training. Cloudflare hopes to create a transparent, consent-driven marketplace that helps creators decide whether to allow all AI crawlers, permit specific ones, or set their own access fees, turning previously unmonetized content usage into new revenue streams. For AI companies, Pay Per Crawl offers a streamlined interface to browse access terms, view pricing, and choose whether to pay or walk away without the data. Major publishers have signed on or expressed support for Cloudflare's latest move to block AI bot crawlers by default, including Gannett, Time, BuzzFeed, The Atlantic, and the Associated Press. This initiative doesn't halt AI innovation, but encourages it to grow responsibly by paying for intellectual property and rewarding the creators behind the data.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI isn't all doom and gloom for jobs, said Amazon's Andy Jassy. Jassy said that AI technologies would create jobs in at least two areas of the company. "With every technical transformation, there will be fewer people doing some of the jobs that the technology actually starts to automate," he said. We're going to hire more people in AI and more people in robotics, and there are going to be other jobs that the technology wants you to go higher that we'll hire over time too." Jassy said that AI agents, which do tasks like coding, research, analytics, and spreadsheet work, would also change the nature of every employee's job. "They won't have to do as much rote work," he said. Jassy's comments came in response to a question about his June 17 memo, which outlined how AI would change the company's workforce. "It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company," he wrote. In internal Slack channels, some called for leadership to share in the fallout, while others saw it as a layoff warning, Business Insider reported. "There is nothing more motivating on a Tuesday than reading that your job will be replaced by AI in a few years," one person wrote in Slack. Amazon employs about 1.5 million workers, according to its website, and has cut almost 28,000 jobs since the start of 2022, per Layoffs.fyi. From Jassy's memo and Monday's interview, it is unclear which or how many Amazon employees would be affected by AI-driven job changes. Other tech CEOs have raised the alarm on AI-related job cuts, especially for white-collar and entry-level roles. In April, Micha Kaufman, the CEO and founder of the freelance-job site Fiverr, wrote in an email to employees that: "It does not matter if you are a programmer, designer, project manager, data scientist, lawyer, customer support rep, salesperson, or a finance person — AI is coming for you." In late May, Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, suggested AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. "We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming," Amodei told Axios in an interview.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft said its medical AI system diagnosed cases more accurately than human doctors by a wide margin. Microsoft's study comes as AI tools rapidly make their way into hospitals and clinics, raising questions about how much of medicine can or should be automated and what role doctors will play as diagnostic AI systems get more capable. Both the AI and physicians had to solve these cases step by step, just like they would in a real clinic: ordering tests, asking questions, and narrowing down possibilities. The AI system was paired with large language models from tech companies like OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic, and Google. The AI system also solved cases "more cost-effectively" than its human counterparts, Microsoft said. "Our findings also suggest that AI reduce unnecessary healthcare costs. "We're taking a big step towards medical superintelligence," said Mustafa Suleyman, the CEO of Microsoft's AI division, in a post on X. Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Microsoft said in the blog post that AI "represents a complement to doctors and other health professionals." "While this technology is advancing rapidly, their clinical roles are much broader than simply making a diagnosis. They need to navigate ambiguity and build trust with patients and their families in a way that AI isn't set up to do," Microsoft said. "Clinical roles will, we believe, evolve with AI," it added. Tech leaders like Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates have said that AI could help solve the long-standing shortage of doctors. "AI will come in and provide medical IQ, and there won't be a shortage," he said on an episode of the "People by WTF" podcast published in April. AI can't replicate physicians' presence, empathy, and nuanced judgment in uncertain or complex conditions, said Dr. Shravan Verma, the CEO of a Singapore-based health tech startup. Chatbots and AI tools can handle the first mile of care, but they must escalate to qualified professionals when needed, he told BI last month. Do you have a story to share about AI in healthcare?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Justice Department said on Monday that it had seized hundreds of computers and accused 13 people of tricking US companies into paying salaries to North Korea. These firms weren't named, but authorities said they include Fortune 500 companies and a defense contractor in California with access to sensitive military technology files. "These schemes target and steal from US companies and are designed to evade sanctions and fund the North Korean regime's illicit programs, including its weapons programs," John Eisenberg, assistant attorney general in the National Security Division, said in a Monday statement. Using that data, they created fake identities for a network of Chinese and Taiwanese people who lived outside America but posed as US-based IT workers or software engineers looking for remote jobs. Authorities said that once hired, the scammers would ask their employers to send work laptops to homes in New Jersey, New York, and California. But these homes were actually "laptop farms," where the computers were plugged into hard drives that gave user access to IT workers in North Korea, per the Justice Department. Prosecutors alleged that Wang Zhengxing, one of the US citizens named in the indictment, hosted one of such laptop farm and created shell companies, such as a fake "VC-backed startup" called Tony WKJ, to receive the fake workers' salaries. The money was then sent to North Korea-controlled accounts. The other US citizen named in court documents, Kejia Wang, is at large. The Justice Department said both men and four other unnamed partners working in the US received at least $696,000 in total from North Korea for their services. Four North Koreans were named in a separate criminal indictment filed in the Northern District Court of Georgia, which accused them of posing as US-based workers and laundering their salaries. They're also accused of stealing data and cryptocurrency from their employers, then lying about the theft. "How many times do I need to tell you??? one of the fake workers wrote in a Telegram message to one of these companies in 2022, per the Justice Department. Other major indictments include the charging of an Arizona woman who was accused in May 2024 of helping North Koreans find work with over 300 companies in the US.</p>
