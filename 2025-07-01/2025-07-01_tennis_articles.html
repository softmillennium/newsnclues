                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON (AP) — Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova waved goodbye to her favorite Grand Slam tournament Tuesday. Her Wimbledon farewell was a 6-3, 6-1 loss to 10th-seeded Emma Navarro of the United States on No. “This place holds the best memories I could wish for,” an emotional Kvitova said in an on-court interview that is usually granted to the match winner. “I will miss Wimbledon for sure,” she continued. But I'm ready for the next chapter in life as well, and I can't wait to be back as a member.” Kvitova, who accepted a wild-card invitation, missed last year's tournament while on maternity leave. The 24-year-old Navarro said Kvitova has been “an incredible player and obviously won this tournament twice, and then had a kid and came back, which is definitely an inspiring story from her end.” Three years later, Kvitova earned her second trophy, defeating Eugenie Bouchard 6-3, 6-0 in the title match. The U.S. Open, she assures, will be her last one. “I am sure,” Kvitova said, noting it's not just the toll on her body.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wimbledon got off to a cracking start on day one with several fantastic storylines developing. Jessica Pegula, the third seed, was sensationally dumped out by Italian youngster Elisabetta Cocciaretto. There was another huge shock in the evening as Coco Gauff fell in straight sets at the hands of Dayana Yastremska. There was no such misfortune for Jack Draper, who breezed into the second round after Sebastian Baez was forced to retire through injury. Dan Evans and Jack Pinnington Jones also secured victories on another brilliant day for the British contingent at SW19. As things stand, a total of 10 home players have made it through to round two. You can follow all the action in Express Sport's LIVE blog below... This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. 2 seed Coco Gauff suffered a shock first-round exit on Court 1, the men's 18th seed Ugo Humbert has gone out of the tournament. Veteran Frenchman Gael Monfils caused a huge upset over five sets. Here's the updated list of seeds to go out on day two. No messing about from Dayana Yastremska - she had Coco Gauff in trouble and she has capitalised in ruthless fashion to win 7-5 6-1. A huge scalp on a day which has seen three of the top-five seeds crash out of the women's draw. The roof has just shut on Centre Court with Novak Djokovic and Alexandre Muller level at one-set all. It's still about more than half-full on Wimbledon's biggest showcourt, even though the fans here have been watching more than seven hours' worth of tennis. They let out a loud cheer when the floodlights were switched on, bathing the court in a warm glow. The second seed is one game away from crashing out of Wimbledon in startling circumstances. Dayana Yastremska won the first set via a tiebreak and she is now 5-1 up in the second set. Incredible scenes on Centre Court as Alexandre Muller wins a lengthy tiebreak to claim the second set against Novak Djokovic! The veteran Serb had six opportunites to wrap up the set but was made to pay for his mistakes. Jack Pinnington Jones is through to the second round on his Wimbledon debut! The 22-year-old has beaten Tomas Etcheverry in straight sets to wrap up a memorable evening at SW19. It finishes 6-7 3-6 5-7 in favour of Pinnington Jones, who celebrates with a fist-pump before soaking up the applause of the crowd. More joy for the Brits on day two! Carlos Alcaraz has sent a heartwarming message to the poorly fan who needed treatment during his victory over Fabio Fognini. The fan's daughter wrote on social media: "Thank you for the concern shown to my mum today who was taken ill during your tennis match at Centre Court. Unlikely you'll see this message but I can try! To her surprise, Alcaraz responded: "You're very welcome, it was nothing! John McEnroe has named Jack Draper as one of four players he believes can go all the way at SW19. "He could win a major for the first time in his life, this is about dealing with the nerves. That's pressure but it's also a pretty cool feeling. "I wouldn't pick Draper as my No. 1 but it's difficult to win three in a row. "In terms of the favourite, it's a toss-up between Alcaraz and Sinner. Jack Draper is not putting any thought into his tough road to the later rounds of Wimbledon. "I can't be thinking five matches ahead," Draper insisted. "Everyone in this draw can play incredible tennis. "You've got to have respect for every one of these guys. Novak Djokovic has made a flying start to his opening match against Alexandre Muller. Muller is up against it and will need to raise his level to get himself back into this contest. Centre Court ticketholders were expecting to watch Coco Gauff take on Dayana Yastremska in her opening match after Novak Djokovic played tonight. However, that match has been moved because of lengthy delays on the main show court. Organisers likely did not expect Gauff and Yastremska to be able to finish tonight after Djokovic and Alexandre Muller stepped onto the court at 7pm, had they remained on Centre. As a result, Gauff's match has been moved to Court 1, with the pair currently walking out in Gauff's bid claim the Channel Slam after her win in Paris. Djokovic, meanwhile, has broken Muller for a third time to take the opening set. "I wanted to play a bit longer, in all honesty," said the young Brit. It's no way to win like that and I wish Sebastian the best in his recovery, of course. The Argentine suffered a nasty fall earlier in the match and appeared to twist his knee, which required medical attention and a five-minute break in play. Draper, who was impressive throughout, next faces Marin Cilic in the second round. With Alexander Zverev going out in a match that started on day one of the tournament and finished on day two, that's five seeded men and five seeded women who have lost so far on Tuesday. French star Arthur Rinderknech stunned No.3 seed Alexander Zverev in a gruelling, four-hour and 40-minute clash that spanned two days. World No.72 Rinderknech returned and earned his biggest win ever 7-6(3) 6-7(8) 6-3 6-7(5) 6-4. Afterwards, he told the Centre Court crowd: “I don't know, I don't even know where to start, start for sure with the crowd because I'm feeling the same way as you guys. I don't know, this woo every time! I'm dying every time you guys are saying woo! “My legs are still shaking, I can't do it anymore, just so happy the match is finished. It's very difficult this sport but, I mean, what a moment. Sebastian Baez has been thoroughly outgunned on Court 1 in just about every department. If the first two are anything to go by, this third set should just be a formality for Britain's number-one hope at this year's tournament. Sebastian Baez has decided to play on after a five-minute delay and medical treatment to his right knee. After watching Jack Draper's opponent take a nasty fall, John McEnroe on BBC commentary said: "That didn't feel too good on the let knee. Potentially he could hurt himself further here in a match that he's got about a two per cent to me chance to winning, maybe five at the most. "Maybe not go through safe so he can play the rest of the year because he needs to get his act together. He doesn't want to injure himself further. "There's going to be mental pain I feel, but physically you don't want to put yourself out for a couple of months if there is something." Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova played her last-ever match at the All England Club on Tuesday, losing 6-3 6-1 to No.10 seed Emma Navaro. Another announcement came a few moments later, saying: "That was Petra Kvitova announcing her final press conference in the main media theatre." Heather Watson has insisted that she has no plans to retire after suffering yet another early Wimbledon exit. Asked if that might have been her last match at SW19, Watson replied: "Hopefully not. We've not even been playing for half an hour and Jack Draper is a third of the way to the second round. He had the beating of Sebastian Baez all ends up there, putting him under pressure both on serve and against it. It'll be over quickly at this rate, unless Baez finds another gear. Ella Seidel retired during her match with Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in the second set after falling to the ground in pain. The 20-year-old tried to play on in her first main draw match at Wimbledon, but was unable to continue and ended up conceding. Jack Draper could hardly have hoped for a better start than this. Baez will need to make more of an impact on serve if he is to prevent Draper running away with it. There is a decent crowd at Court One to watch Jack Draper begin his Wimbledon campaign. Or will he end up being the latest victim of another upset? Iga Swiatek has admitted to smuggling towels out of every Grand Slam tournament due to floods of requests from her family and friends. "It's a topic no one ever talks about. Swiatek is only 24 but she turned professional almost a decade ago, and she has a huge amount of Grand Slam experience, having won four French Opens and two US Open titles. That, it turns out, has landed her and her loved ones more towels than they could ever have dreamed of. "I have a lot at home," she added. I think I'm going to have to build another room in my house just for Grand Slam towels." Wimbledon announced that they would be breaking protocol on Centre Court to allow today's losing player, Petra Kvitova, to address the crowd in an interview. Kvitova lost to 10th seed Emma Navarro in her final ever match at SW19. She is retiring this year after the US Open. Martina Navratilova, her long-time rival, was in tears on BBC commentary and said: “It's hard for me to talk right now, she's just such a nice person on and off the court, a role model everywhere." "This place holds the best memories I could wish for." Dan Evans could face Novak Djokovic in the second round after winning an all-British affair with Jay Clarke. And the 35-year-old is desperate for a potential blockbuster to be put on Centre Court, if Djokovic comes through his opener against Frenchman Alexandre Muller today. "I would love it to be on Centre," he told the BBC. I have played him before and it would be really nice to play Novak, who if he won't mind me saying is at the latter end of his career. There has been another upset on Court Three with reigning Olympic champion Qinwen Zheng falling at the first hurdle. She has been beaten in three sets by Katerina Siniakova, who is unseeded. Zheng would have been hoping for a deep run at SW19 but will instead be left to mull over what went wrong. Dan Evans defeated fellow Brit Jay Clarke in straight sets, but the match was not without controversy. Evans was accused by BBC commentators of using the “dark arts” to make his opponent “salty” during a tense second set. Clarke asked the umpire about Evans “walking to the side and then walking back” before asking “is that normal?” BBC commentator Dominic Inglot explained: "Dan Evans is a master of the dark arts, let's say, and he's used them extremely well there. You could say Jay Clarke is right, but on the flip side he has to be mentally tougher than that. “He can't be falling for those little tricks. Maybe a little bit salty there after getting broken." Last year's Wimbledon semi-finalist Lorenzo Musetti crashed out 12 months later in the first round to Georgian qualifier Nikoloz Basilashvili. 126 Basilashvili upset Musetti 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 and secured his first-ever win at a Grand Slam. And Musetti blamed his lack of preparation on grass. "Even in the lateral movements, which normally I know how to move, seemed like I'd never played on this surface. 28 seed Alexander Bublik has just become the latest top player to suffer a massive upset in the first round. The recent Halle champion was projected to meet British No. 1 Jack Draper in the third round - a rematch of their recent French Open clash, where Bublik sent the world No. But Jaume Munar stunned the Kazakh in five sets, and Draper no longer has Bublik lurking in his section. Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa have fuelled rumours of a split by unfollowing each other on Instagram. Tsitsipas has also seemingly removed all pictures of Badosa from his profile. The couple went public with their relationship in 2023 before temporarily breaking up last summer. They got back together just weeks later but there are now strong suggestions that they have gone their separate ways again. They are still due to play together in the US Open mixed doubles event later this year. Taylor Fritz was not happy last night after he was forced to end his match early with Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard last night. Barbora Krejcikova has made a winning start to her Wimbledon title defence. She beats Alexandra Eala in three sets, coming from behind to secure a 3-6 6-2 6-1 victory. Krejcikova was made to work hard but ultimately did enough to win and book her place in the second round. Wimbledon star Daria Kasatkina admitted that she was so nervous that she needed to throw up before her first-round match. The Aussie defeated Emiliana Arango in straight sets, but she struggled before stepping onto Court 14 and had to vomit. "I'm happy how I was able to manage those nerves because at the start of the day was very, very tough for me," she said. "The little accident happened completely out of nerves. "There was nothing else wrong with me except this. Not having enough confidence, losing a couple of matches, the first match of the day….this doesn't help me to feel more calm. But before the match, I was so stressed, maybe too much." Jannik Sinner admitted that he was surprised by the scorching heat at Wimbledon after beating Luca Nardi in straight sets. Playing against an Italian is very unfortunate but the atmosphere, as always, was amazing. "I know it's very hot and humid, I don't remember the last time it was like this in London. "We have worked a lot on the serve. Dan Evans has taken the first set against fellow Brit Jay Clarke. He has since missed a break point in the second, however, and slapped his knee with his racket. Clarke then saved another break point in a 17-shot rally and holds. It's a comfortable final set for Sinner as he bagels Nardi and wins 6-4 6-3 6-0. A much more seamless victory for the Italian than rival Carlos Alcaraz enjoyed. Jannik Sinner started the second set with a hold, a break and then another hold to put him in the driving seat. From there, he never relinquished control and won it 6-3. He is two up and firmly in charge of this first-round match on Court 1. Some very solid stuff being played by the top seed - the kind of tennis that should instil at least some fear in Carlos Alcaraz after his sloppy performance yesterday. Two stars have already received medical timeouts in the opening hours today. Katerina Siniakova has just received medication in her match against Qinwen Zheng, which is set to continue. A ball boy was replaced during Alex De Minaur's victory over Roberto Carballes Baena. "We are just waiting for someone to replace a ball boy. They are not feeling well," said the umpire on Court 18. Temperatures have exceeded 30 degrees celsius on a scorching hot day at the Championships. Jannik Sinner is a set up on Court 1 after an opportune break of serve against Luca Nardi. Luca Nardi once joked that he was simply the "guy who beat Novak Djokovic". He will hope that even more people know his name after his clash with Jannik Sinner on Centre Court. Putintseva was beaten 6-0 6-0 by Amanda Anisimova yesterday and, midway through the first set, she alerted an individual to the umpire. She asked the umpire: “Can you take him out? I'm not going to continue playing until he leaves. Wimbledon say a situation on court was dealt with. We're pushing 32 degrees Celsius on Court 1 and it's sweltering even in the shade. Lord knows how Jannik Sinner and Luca Nardi are feeling in the direct sunlight. Top seed Sinner will hope he doesn't suffer the same fate today. It's an all-Italian clash to get him going, and I'm sure he'll want to be back under the AC as soon as possible. Manchester United fan Jack Draper has received a good luck message from the club ahead of his Wimbledon first-round match this afternoon. United wished him well on X, posting: "British no.1 Jack Draper kicks off his #Wimbledon campaign later today! British no.1 Jack Draper kicks off his #Wimbledon campaign later today! Elisabetta Cocciaretto has revealed that she was in hospital during Wimbledon last year. Cocciaretto said on court: “For sure I played with a player like her before, Iga [Swiatek], Aryna [Sabalenka], all of those players that you have to do the best you can on the court and take the little chances they give you. To be more aggressive, to go for it and don't think about winning or losing the point, just do your best. “I had a lot of stops last year. That's why I was so pumped to play because I think it's the best tournament and grass is always special to play. “I don't think too much about my ranking right now. With the ranking, you can play other tournaments. She's the 11th seed to lose so far at SW19, and day two is barely underway. Here are all the top players to go out so far. Nick Kyrgios has cheekily suggested that Emma Raducanu is in a 'love triangle' with Carlos Alcaraz and Jack Draper. Some Alcaraz fans feared that Kyrgios might be trying to muscle in when he left a supportive comment on one of Raducanu's recent Instagram posts. Harriet Dart has partially blamed the heat on her first-round defeat against Dalma Galfi. The British star lost in three sets and argued that the home favourites are not well equipped to deal with the blazing temperatures, which are set to exceed 30 degrees celsius this week. “We're not very well equipped in this country to deal with it, so it becomes more of a shock. I was slow to adapt to seeing the ball but she served really well, particularly in big moments.” Alcaraz's five-set victory on Centre Court was suspended during the decider as medical personnel attended to a fan. Eluned Lewis wrote on X: "Thank you @carlosalcaraz for the concern shown to my mum today, who was taken ill during your tennis match at Centre Court @Wimbledon today. Unlikely you'll see this message, but I can try! Thank you @carlosalcaraz for the concern shown to my mum today who was taken ill during your tennis match at Centre Court @Wimbledon today. Unlikely you\u2019ll see this message but I can try! Novak Djokovic is about to begin his bid for Wimbledon glory against a tennis star with an unusual sponsorship deal. And while Alexandre Muller insists that his affiliation with OnlyFans is not exactly what it seems, the 28-year-old still refers to himself as 'the sexiest professional tennis player from France'. Muller said in an interview with The Sun: "[OnlyFans] wants to change their image. Then I showed them my platform and they said: ‘OK, it's very cool.' My job is a tennis player, not making movies for adults. I received a lot of messages, saying: ‘Alex, can you show me this?' Alcaraz made hard work of a five-set victory over Fabio Fognini. McEnroe believes it was a 'wake-up call' for the Spaniard. Perhaps he assumed this Fognini would fall away pretty quickly. You've got to give Fognini credit, but he was up a set and 4-2. He won Queen's, everything was perfect, same as last year. "He won the French Open, pulls out an incredible match [against Jannik Sinner], parties in Ibiza with his buddies, comes to Queen's and almost loses early, but goes on and wins it. Great Britain's Heather Watson is currently in action against Denmark's Clara Tauson on BBC Two. Elsewhere, British wildcard Johannus Monday has started his tough test against world No. Sonay Kartal successfully sought revenge over 20th seed Jelena Ostapenko at Wimbledon. The British star defeated Ostapenko in three sets, a mere few days after losing to the Latvian in Eastbourne. “I felt great coming into it, so to get that kind of win, I've got masses of confidence,” Kartal said. It's the most confident I've also got in my game. Daniil Medvedev admits he is suffering from a lack of confidence after crashing out of Wimbledon in round one yesterday. 64 Benjamin Bonzi in four sets at SW19 to continue his nightmare run. If not for the results in Halle, I would be here and say something is definitely missing. "This year, I lost a lot of close calls. "If I finish the year ranked somewhere around No. 15 in the world, maybe I'll be more worried. Yulia Putintseva asked the chair umpire to remove a 'crazy' spectator during her first-round defeat at Wimbledon on Monday. And she was evidently bothered by someone in the crowd. Putintseva said to the umpire: "Can you take him out because maybe he has a knife, I am not going to continue playing until he leaves. During his ultimately suspended clash with Taylor Fritz on Court No. That eclipses the previous record of 148pmh set by Taylor Dent in 2010. Carlos Alcaraz and Aryna Sabalenka are the current bookmakers' favourites to triumph in this year's Wimbledon singles, according to Betway. Wimbledon have been urged to ditch their strict all-white kit policy. The rules were tightened in the mid 1990s to dictate that all players must wear all-white kit on court, including tracksuits and other clothing. Women have since been told they can wear dark undershorts to prevent anxiety during their menstrual cycles. Billie Jean King believes the 1995 rule change was a "total mistake" and says television viewers struggle to tell players apart during matches. She told the Telegraph: “There's a match that comes on, you sit down, and you look – let's say it's television – who's who? I shouldn't have to look at a mark, I shouldn't have to look at anything. Jack Draper can go all the way and win his first Grand Slam at this year's Wimbledon, claims 1994 champion Conchita Martinez. He's up with the top players," Martinez told BoyleSports. “He's a great guy, and he won the men's title at Indian Wells when Mirra won the women's title, and we saw what he was like practising on the court. “You can tell when a player really wants it. I didn't see him play a lot, but then you pay attention, and he can play on any surface. “Carlos and Jannik are a bit ahead of Jack. He needs to be consistent the whole year. Jack has the game to go to the net and be aggressive, but you're up against two guys who can produce amazing shots. “Jack has a very good chance of making the semi-finals at Wimbledon. I think Alcaraz will be suitable for Jack's game. Rising British star Oliver Tarvet has theoretically banked £99,000 at Wimbledon this year. But rather harsh circumstances mean the qualifier will not see most of that money following a run that will see him meet Carlos Alcaraz in round two. His amateur status combined with American college rules mean Tarvet is only allowed to claim £7,290 as his own, in addition to genuine tennis expenses - which will at least allow him to enter more prestige tournaments than before. Tarvet joked: “I've got to find £60,000 – £70,000 of expenses – tennis is an expensive sport. I have a lot of goals at USD still.” Nick Kyrgios has backed Coco Gauff to progress beyond the Wimbledon fourth round for the first time ever this summer. Kyrgios believes that should change in the coming weeks. “But you look at some of the results that she's had over the last six months, and I think confidence-wise she's fixed those existing problems on a second serve as well. “So I think she's fixed those, and I think you know serving at Wimbledon is the most important thing. It is expected to be another scorching hot day at Wimbledon. Temperatures across London and parts of the south-east of England are forecast to reach as high as 34 degrees celsius. Express Sport explained the rules that are in place when temperatures reach such levels here. And here's a glimpse at the big names in ladies' singles action today... The former finalist was in tears as she called for a medical timeout during her match against Viktoriya Tomova. She attempted to continue but eventually retired while trailing 7-6 2-0. "I wasn't expecting not to feel good," said Jabeur. "It doesn't really help me with my confidence and what I keep pushing myself to do, even though it was a very tough season for me. "[I will] definitely try to disconnect a little bit from tennis and try to just enjoy life outside tennis, recover and spend a little bit of time with the family and hopefully that could recharge me. John McEnroe has told Fabio Fognini to retire after his defeat against Carlos Alcaraz. Fognini, 38, was playing in his 15th Wimbledon and recently hinted that he was going to step away from the tour. He took two sets from the world No. Carlos looked more tired than Fognini even though there's a 16-year age gap! What in the hell is going on here? "So the crowd started rallying behind Alcaraz and that picked him up a little bit. I almost hope that [Fognini] doesn't play anymore because I'm not sure he can play any better than that. "I played [Fognini's wife] Flavio Panetta in seniors mixed doubles at the French [Open] and she thinks it's time for Fabio to be at home more with the kids. I think she is ready for her husband to be home more." Wimbledon could face chaos today with suspended matches added to the updated order of play. Several matches were halted before the 11pm curfew last night, including those involving Alexander Zverev and Taylor Fritz. It leaves bosses with a potential headache as some courts are set to host up to five matches. Centre Court will have four ties, the same as yesterday. Novak Djokovic has been given a brutal reality check ahead of his Wimbledon campaign. It is widely accepted that Wimbledon provides the Serb's final opportunity to land a coveted 25th Grand Slam title. But former tennis star Feliciano Lopez says Djokovic is not on the same level as rivals Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner anymore. “Djokovic proved that he can still compete at this level but he will have a better chance on grass.” Wimbledon's curfew is not until 11pm but Fritz's clash with Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard was halted 40 minutes prior. To a chorus of boos, Fritz ranted at the umpire, believing there was more than enough time for a final set to take place. Never at Wimbledon have seven Brits all won on the same day. Katie Boulter saw off ninth seed Paula Badosa on Centre Court, while Emma Raducanu defeated Mimi Xu in an all-British clash. Sonay Kartal beat 20th-seed Jelena Ostapenko in immediate revenge for her Eastbourne loss. Arthur Fery, Cam Norrie and Billy Harris all progressed. Hello and welcome back to Express Sport's coverage of Wimbledon. Alexander Zverev will head into day two of Wimbledon on a level playing field with Arthur Rinderknech. The two players will resume their first-round battle tomorrow with everything still to play for. Former tennis star Todd Woodbridge believes that Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard should be over the moon with the decision to suspend his Wimbledon first-round clash with Taylor Fritz. The big-serving Frenchman had just lost two sets on the bounce when match officials opted to call it off and pick it back up tomorrow with the 11pm curfew closing in. With the scores at two sets apiece, Woodbridge said: "I'm a little surprised by that decision. "The sets that we had have all been under 45 minutes, they've been close to it but there was definitely the chance of an outcome there tonight. "I think Mpetshi Perricard, good for him, he should get off and be very happy with that. Taylor Fritz will be a little annoyed by that decision I have no doubt because he played an exceptional tiebreak from 5-1 down to hang in." Fritz, who had just edged a fourth-set tiebreak to force a deciding set, was also left raging with the decision. He was well within his rights to be upset, given that there would probably have been enough time for the match to reach a conclusion. Spare a thought for the paying ticket-holders who have seemingly been denied the full value of their money. Holger Rune was left frustrated after throwing away a two-set lead against Nicolas Jarry earlier today. The Dane was in control until the return of a troublesome knee injury saw him slip to a 4-6 4-6 7-5 6-3 6-4 loss. After the match, Rune had some interesting words for Jarry while discussing his defeat. He said: "If I play normal, I'm beating him nine out of ten times, with all respect for Nicolas Jarry. Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard broke a long-standing Wimbledon record during his match against Taylor Fritz. It saw him surpass the previous benchmark of 148mph, which was set by Taylor Dent back in 2010. Mpetshi Perricard currently leads Fritz by two sets to one, with his American opponent battling to avoid an early exit. The Italian is in the midst of his final season as a professional and McEnroe thinks that his last outing at Wimbledon would be the ideal note on which to end his career. Carlos looked more tired than Fognini even though there's a 16-year age gap! What in the hell is going on here? "So the crowd started rallying behind Alcaraz and that picked him up a little bit. I almost hope that [Fognini] doesn't play anymore because I'm not sure he can play any better than that. "I played [Fognini's wife] Flavio Panetta in seniors mixed doubles at the French [Open] and she thinks it's time for Fabio to be at home more with the kids. I think she is ready for her husband to be home more." Play on the outdoor courts has been suspended for poor light. Botic van de Zandschulp led Matteo Arnaldi by two tiebreak sets on Court 12 when they had to stop. And Shintaro Mochizuki had just forced a fifth and final set against Giulio Zeppieri when their match was abandoned for the night. As well as Boulter, there were victories for Cameron Norrie, Arthur Fery, Sonay Kartal, Emma Raducanu, Oliver Tarvet and Billy Harris. Some of those were huge upsets and it remains to be seen how the British contingent will fare in the second round. There has been ANOTHER huge upset at Wimbledon and this time it's courtesy of Katie Boulter. It's been a brilliant opening day for the home contingent and Boulter looks delighted after securing her own surprise victory. She will go up against Solana Sierra in her next match on Wednesday. Nick Kyrgios was spotted in Naomi Osaka's box to watch her beat Talia Gibson earlier today. He would have been impressed with the relatively straightforward manner of her 6-4 7-6 victory on Court 18. Nick Kyrgios was in Naomi Osaka\u2019s box for her first round match at Wimbledon. Yulia Putintseva suffered a humbling fall from grace just under 12 months after her barnstorming Wimbledon win over Iga Swiatek. The only positive she can take is that the suffering didn't last long, as her bid for glory at SW19 was ended in just 43 minutes by Amanda Anisimova. Putintseva went on the best Wimbledon run of her career in 2024. But this grass-court season has been considerably less successful. With only 30 per cent of points won on her first serve and zero break point opportunities in the entire match, Putintseva was thrashed 6-0 6-0 by 13th seed Anisimova in a one-sided mauling on Court 15. And she didn't take it especially well. During a changeover, Putintseva was seen sobbing into her towel with both hands covering her face as the crowd watched on. 5 seed Qinwen Zheng's first-round match against Katerina Siniakova has been cancelled. They were due to play fourth on Court 3 but play has run over, as former finalist and 32nd seed Matteo Berrettini is locked in battle with Kamil Majchrzak. There was an almighty cheer on Court 1 after Emma Raducanu's victory, as the fans were informed they were getting a fourth bonus match - Taylor Fritz vs Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. We could have a similar scenario on Centre - Boulter vs Badosa still isn't done and the Zverev vs Rinderknech match is due after. It means a decider will be required to split the two players on Centre Court. The momentum is with the ninth seed and Boulter will need to dig deep to turn things around. Emma Raducanu was in a jovial mood after beating Mingge Xu to reach the second round. Reflecting on the incident in her post-match interview, the young Brit said: "I'm glad people were having fun today. "I saw a champagne cork fly onto the court so that was fun, glad you guys are having a good time, cheers to you." Katie Boulter has just stormed into the lead against ninth seed Paula Badosa. Emma Raducanu makes the perfect start to her Wimbledon campaign with a routine victory over Mingge Xu. Katie Boulter, meanwhile, has just broken Paula Badosa in the early stages of their match over on Centre Court. Carlos Alcaraz paid a touching tribute to Fabio Fognini after knocking him out of what looks to be his final Wimbledon. "I don't know why it's his last Wimbledon, because the level he is playing, he can still play for three or four more years," said Alcaraz. "I have to give him the credit for such a great match. I'm just a little bit sad that it's probably his last Wimbledon but I'm happy to have shared the court and the locker room with him, and we are going to enjoy the last of him." Carlos Alcaraz is safely through to the second round after a titanic battle with Fabio Fognini. He will face either Dan Evans or Jay Clarke in the second round later this week. Emma Raducanu is already a set up against Mingge Xu on Court One. Carlos Alcaraz's match with Fabio Fognini has been stopped due to a medical emergency in the crowd. Play was paused as the umpire announced a break of play after Alcaraz went into his bag to grab a bottle of water and give it to the person involved. The umpire said: "Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately there has been an incident with a spectator. He looks all over the place and needs to find a solution quickly. Emma Raducanu's first-round match against British teenage wildcard Mimi Xu is about to start on Court 1. Joao Fonseca apologised for beating British star Jacob Fearnley on Court 1. I am looking forward to the next meeting against him." There's been another huge upset in the men's singles draw. 8 seed Holger Rune suffered defeat at the hands of qualifier Nicolas Jarry after leading by two sets to love. But former world No.16 Jarry, whose ranking has slipped outside the top 140, stormed back to win 4-6 4-6 7-5 6-3 6-4. Rune is the second top-10 ATP star to lose on Monday after Daniil Medvedev was stunned by Benjamin Bonzi. It ends 6-4 6-1 7-6 in favour of the Brazilian teenager on Court One. Emma Raducanu is next up against Mingge Xu and you can follow game-by-game updates via our dedicated match blog. Carlos Alcaraz breaks Fabio Fognini to win the third set on Centre Court. Alcaraz, however, has the momentum back on his side and will be hugely difficult to stop. Stefanos Tsitsipas has suggested that he could retire from tennis after being forced to withdraw from Wimbledon due to injury. Tsitsipas has since opened up on his injury problems in a heartbreaking press conference. "It's probably the most difficult situation that I've ever been faced with, because it's an ongoing issue that doesn't seem to be disappearing or fading off as much. "Myself, as a person, I have a limit at some point, so I'll definitely have to have my final answer on whether I want to do stuff or not in the next couple of months. "This is going to be hard, but if I see it going in that trajectory, there is no point at competing." Arthur Fery pulls off another Wimbledon shock by securing a 6-4 6-1 4-6 6-4 victory over Alexei Popyrin. Fery, who is ranked outside the world's top 400, had never won a tour-level match before today. It is arguably the biggest surprise of the day, coming just hours after Sonay Kartal dumped out Jelena Ostapenko. Fery will face either Roman Safiullin or Luciano Darderi in the second round on Wednesday. He has momentum on his side but will need to keep it up to spring a surprise against the defending champion. You can follow game-by-game updates via our dedicated match blog. Joao Fonseca is a set up against Jacob Fearnley here on Court 1. The Brit hasn't been able to find his serve and gave away five double faults to trail 6-4. Fonseca win the final game on Fernley's serve to love. Sir Gareth Southgate and Sir David Beckham are both in the royal box today, fresh from receiving their honours at Buckingham Palace. They watched on as Carlos Alcaraz played Fabio Fognini. Tarvet is able to claim up to £7,282 in expenses as well as the expenses he has incurred during the tournament. However, it means the young Brit will miss out on the vast majority of his Wimbledon payout, which will go to his university. Aryna Sabalenka was delighted with her first-round win over Carson Branstine. Jacob Fearnley has the lion's share of support here inside Court 1. There is the odd 'come on Fonseca' being screamed from the stands but every point Fearnley wins drowns it out. Another seed goes down as Stefanos Tsitsipas retires while trailing Valentin Royer 6-3 6-2. But after losing it 6-2, the 24th seed appeared to be asking Goran Ivanisevic whether he should continue, then told the umpire he was done. I've just taken my place on Court 1 for Jacob Fearnley vs Joao Fonseca. Two rising stars have shown plenty of promise so far in 2025. The big question is how many Brazilian fans will have tickets to this area that is basking in the south west London sun. Fonseca's followers travel in their numbers and are known to make quite the noise... The two-time Grand Slam finalist is a set and double-break down to qualifier Valentin Royer and has called the physio. He's receiving an on-court medical time-out on his back as new coach Goran Ivanisevic watches on from his box. Ninth seed Daniil Medvedev - who has reached the semi-final here for two years running - has suffered a huge upset in the first round. 1 7-6(2) 3-6 7-6(3) 6-2 on Court 2, handing Medvedev his first-ever opening-round loss at Wimbledon, and went to embrace his team, who had been watching courtside. Bonzi said: "This is special for me today. "I love this place so it's very special, Daniil is a great player, he did two semi-finals so I knew it was a tough match but sometimes it's better to play this kind of player in the first round, anything can happen. But one more time this is a great place to play tennis. Fabio Fognini is exchanging games with Carlos Alcaraz on Centre Court. He appeared to stretch out his hamstring after the opening point of the match but seems perfectly comfortable now. Fancy taking a closer look at Carlos Alcaraz's battle with Fabio Fognini on Centre Court? Wildcard Oliver Crawford became the first Brit to lose a singles match at Wimbledon this year. 248 too the first set over Italian star Mattia Bellucci but went out 6-7(3) 6-4 6-4. It's been a successful day for the Brits otherwise so far, with Sonay Kartal and Oliver Tarvet winning. Daniil Medvedev is on the brink of an early exit at Wimbledon as he is 2-1 behind and a break down in the fourth set against Benjamin Bonzi. The British star said afterwards: “Yeah I would say that was by far one of the toughest matches I've played, I struggle against the big hitters so to be able to get that win today after she beat me easily last week. I knew that maybe I wouldn't get the results straight away but eventually it would pay off and it did today. I left here last year feeling a much more confident player on and off the court. I knew my level was there, just eventually had to force it out of myself. Oliver Tarvet has admitted he is overjoyed after defeating Leandro Riedi in the first round of Wimbledon. “There's a lot of emotions,” explained the 21-year-old Briton. “I'm just really overjoyed to be in this situation you know. Obviously it was my first Tour-level event and then to come out here, come through qualifying and also win in the first round at Wimbledon and have a chance to play maybe Carlos [Alcaraz] on Wednesday is just truly incredible. “It's a dream come true for me to play here. You work for these types of moments, you work to play on the most prestigious court in the world. It's a red-hot day at Wimbledon, as you may have heard. The temperature on Centre Court right now is 30 degrees Celsius and it's only going to get hotter as the afternoon wears on. Carlos Alcaraz and Fabio Fognini are first up - the firm favourite will be keen to wrap it up swiftly and get back under the AC. It's been a good day for the Britons so far, and Tarvet will join Sonay Kartal in the second round following her victory over Jelena Ostapenko. Oliver Tarvet is about to serve for the match against Riedi. Ons Jabeur has said that she didn't expect to feel bad on the court after retiring from her first-round match at Wimbledon. The two-time runner-up here broke down in tears 26 minutes into the match then took a medical time out but continued playing. Doesn't really help me with my confidence and what I keep pushing myself to do even though it was a very tough season for me. As for what she'll do next, she added: “Definitely try to disconnect a little bit from tennis and try to just enjoy life outside tennis. Sonay Kartal became the first Brit to win a match at Wimbledon this year, upsetting 20th seed and former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko 7-5 2-6 6-2. Ostapenko beat Kartal just six days ago in Eastbourne but the world No.51 got her revenge and said: “I would say that was by far one of the toughest matches I've played, I struggle against the big hitters so to be able to get that win today after she beat me easily last week. Kartal reached the third round here as a qualifier ranked down at No. Daniil Medvedev has struck back against unseeded Frenchman Benjamin Bonzi by taking the second set 6-3. But he's a break down in the third set. Medvedev reached back-to-back semi-finals at the All England Club in 2023 and 2024 and won the US Open in 2021. Novak Djokovic accepts that Wimbledon could be his final chance to land a 25th Grand Slam title. He has won seven of those titles at Wimbledon and believes the grass courts are his best chance of adding to his tally. Djokovic said: “I would probably agree that Wimbledon could be the best chance because of the results I had, because of how I feel, how I play at Wimbledon, just getting that extra push mentally and motivation to perform the best tennis at the highest level.” Two-time finalist Ons Jabeur has retired from her opening match against Viktoriya Tomova. 2 Jabeur broke down in tears just 26 minutes into the first set and needed a medical time out but continued playing and lost it in a tiebreak. She threw in the towel with Tomova leading 7-6(5) 2-0. Ninth seed and two-time semi-finalist Daniil Medvedev is in trouble. Two-time Wimbledon semi-finalist Elina Svitolina became the first winner of this year's Championships. Famous faces have flocked to Wimbledon on day one of the tournament - although some are more familiar than others. Celeb spotters will not have had too much trouble recognising David Beckham in a recent Instagram post, but the one-time Wimbledon champion he was smiling alongside may have caught a few others out. He has therefore done plenty of mingling with some of the biggest names in tennis, and one player he seems to have struck up a bond with is five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova. Sharapova grinned from ear to ear as she sat alongside Beckham for a wholesome photo posted to her Instagram account, which was accompanied by the caption: "Let the (Wimbledon) games begin". But she looked completely different from the leggy, blond-haired sports superstar fans came to know during her 19-year playing career. Now, at 38 years old, Sharapova has ditched the light-coloured locks for shorter and darker hair, and the difference is striking. But they'll need to dig into their pockets, with pints of Stella costing £8.85 while Pimm's is £12.25 a cup, and there's a top-line wine on offer in one restaurant for £217.50. Briton Oliver Tarvet was forced to come through qualifying to reach the Wimbledon main draw but has clinched the first set against Swiss opponent Leandro Riedi after winning it 6-4. Fellow Briton Sonay Kartal, meanwhile, has won the first set 7-5 against 20th seed Jelena Ostapenko after fighting off set points and battling back from a break down. Ons Jabeur called for a medical time-out in her match against Viktoriya Tomova. Jabeur was in tears as she waited to have her vitals checked by a doctor. Aryna Sabalenka, who is the favourite to win the ladies' singles title this year, will take on Canadian model Carson Branstine in her opening match today. I didn't want to ask my parents for anything, I wanted everything to come from me and my tennis.” It is unclear why he has withdrawn from the tournament. Lucky loser Cristian Garin of Chile will take Carreno Busta's place in the first round. There will be a host of star players to look out for on the outside courts today. Two-time Grand Slam finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas will be in action on Court 12 after Frances Tiafoe makes an appearance on the same court. And Leylah Fernandez, who lost to Emma Raducanu in the 2021 US Open final, will also feature on Court 12. Two-time Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur will play on Court 14, with former Canadian Open champion Alexei Popyrin appearing on Court 15. Meanwhile, Jiri Lehecka, who defeated Jack Draper in the Queen's semi-finals, will play his first round match on Court 17. Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova will play at the All England Club for the final time at this year's tournament. Kvitova was the women's singles champion in 2011 and 2014. But also bad memories, because losing with the pressure there is hard. “Even with the two best results of my career, I do feel like sometimes the losses were very, very painful. Rules and regulations have been brought in line with every other ATP Tour event, and most WTA Tour events, which now use electronic line calling. All 18 courts will use the technology, which features an automated 'out' call. Players will be unable to challenge decisions as they have done in previous years. Tennis -playing friends Linda, 62, and Aleta, 46, were the first on the scene but a few hours later queue experts Vicki and Nigel Broad from Neath in South Wales rocked up. They all got chatting and once Linda and Aleta realised they were talking to seasoned Wimbledon queue experts in Vicki and Nigel they allowed the Brit pair to pitch their tent first. Linda, who plays tennis with Aleta in a tennis team called Hotshots in Houston, explained: "We just don't want to be first so we let them go ahead." While Linda admitted this was actually a bit of a tactic for them to avoid the full glare of media scrutiny on Monday morning, they were also happy to let some Brits be first in line in the 10,000 strong queue. Wimbledon CEO Sally Bolton has confirmed that the queue was closed around an hour ago due to it being at capacity. Jannik Sinner has refused to explain why he sacked two members of his team on the eve of Wimbledon. 1 dismissed fitness coach Marco Panichi and physiotherapist Ulises Badio. Both men were replacements for staff fired in the aftermath of Sinner's doping case, for which he voluntarily served a three-month ban. No reason has been given for the departures of Panichi and Badio. The timing obviously isn't the best, but having done a lot of work before, it won't affect this Grand Slam a lot. There will be plenty of big-hitters on No. 2 Court as well today, with Daniil Medvedev, Madison Keys and Jasmine Paolini all in action. Estimated 1pm | Elena-Gabriela Ruse vs Madison Keys | Ladies' singles Estimated 2.30pm | Jasmine Paolini vs Anastasija Sevastova | Ladies' singles Estimated 4pm | Taylor Fritz vs Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard | Men's singles Waiting staff were rushed off their feet as tennis fans flocked to SW19 well before the gates open at 10am. The Ivy in particular was packed out with staff donning green blazers. I spoke to one gentleman on the way down to the All England CLub who had his queue card. Emma Raducanu's stalker was blocked from gaining entry to Wimbledon this week. A man who had followed Raducanu to events in Asia earlier this year, before handing her a letter and a signed photo, had attempted to purchase tickets through the ballot. Raducanu told the BBC last week: “When I heard that, my thoughts were that everyone at Wimbledon had done an amazing job. It's just something that maybe we all have to deal with at some point. Raducanu faces British rising star Mimi Xu, 17, in the first round today. 1 Court today, with three Britons in action afterwards. Estimated 3pm | Jacob Fearnley vs Joao Fonseca | Men's singles Estimated 6pm | Emma Raducanu vs Mimi Xu | Ladies' singles Wimbledon could be set for its hottest ever temperatures this week as a heatwave hits the south and east of England. On Tuesday, parts of south-east England could then hit 35, according to forecaster Matthew Lenhart. Since 1960, UK temperatures in June have only exceeded 34 degrees three times. Last summer's tournament was disrupted by rain during the earlier rounds. Briton Katie Boulter and German star Alexander Zverev will also be in action on the show court. Estimated 3.30pm | Paula Badosa vs Katie Boulter | Ladies' singles Estimated 5pm | Arthur Rinderknech vs Alexander Zverev | Men's singles Avocado enjoyers will be left disappointed in SW19 over the next fortnight. According to The Times, avocado has been replaced by crushed peas in a bold choice. In addition, 30 of the 42 kitchens on site will not use gas. It is forecast to hit 36 degrees Celsius at Wimbledon today, with the record temperature recorded during The Championships coming a decade ago as the temperature peaked at 35.7 degrees Celsius. UK health officials have issued an amber heat health warning until 6pm tomorrow for the majority of the country, including Wimbledon. Fabio Fognini banned his young son from speaking with Carlos Alcaraz at Wimbledon. The veteran Italian will play Alcaraz in what could be his final Wimbledon appearance. “Two days ago, when the draw came out, my son called me and said, 'Dad, see, you're playing against Carlitos'. And I said, 'Yes, do you want to come? Reigning men's champion Carlos Alcaraz has revealed that he has linked up with Andy Murray for a game of golf. When asked about how he prepares for Grand Slam tournaments ahead of Wimbledon, the Spaniard said: “I play some golf. Actually, I play with Andy Murray on Monday and a few more players.” He added: “Just went to the centre a little bit. Just wanted to go to the centre a little bit, walk around, have good food, and just having quality time with them doing some stuff that probably I wouldn't be able to do it while the tournament is on.” The rule, which will come into force if temperatures go beyond 30.1 degrees Celsius, will allow a 10-minute pause between the third and fourth set of men's matches, or between sets two and three of women's matches. “It applies to all matches including those which have already started. Emma Raducanu has talked down her chances of success at Wimbledon after admitting she received some “pretty bad news” in the lead up to the tournament. The 22-year-old Briton explained in her pre-tournament press conference: “Truthfully, I don't expect much from myself this year. I just want to go out there and embrace the moment. “I know there's not many opportunities to be playing at Wimbledon. So grab a coffee and stick with us throughout the day for live updates.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tommy Paul has been known to enjoy a classic match from years past, but the American got to see one play out in real time when he spent a Sunday watching Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner for the Roland Garros title—all from the comfort of his phone.“I do love watching tennis while I'm in the tournament,” Paul told Steve Weissman and Jon Wertheim in his visit to the Tennis Channel Live Desk following a first-round Wimbledon win over Johannus Monday. “I do love watching tennis while I'm in the tournament,” Paul told Steve Weissman and Jon Wertheim in his visit to the Tennis Channel Live Desk following a first-round Wimbledon win over Johannus Monday. Paul had played Alcaraz in the quarterfinals and, hindered by injury, managed just four games against the eventual champion. “People have a lot of catching up to do. These guys are dominating when it comes to the Slams. These are the tournaments everyone wants to do the best in, and they're three out of five set matches. In best three out of five, I feel like the better player comes out on top most of the time, and they seem to be coming out on top every time. It shows that the people right below them really have to gain a level to be competing with them in these events.“Last year here against Carlos, I feel like I picked my level up in the opening set and at some point you feel like Carlos took it to another level and I couldn't stay there with him. It kind of feels like he's got constant pressure on you the entire time and you can't hit one ball that's without a ton of quality or he's on top of you, attacking the net. If you don't play deep in the court and hit the ball hard, he's on offense and you definitely don't want to be on defense with those guys.” “I think right now those guys are a level above everyone else,” said Paul, Wimbledon's No. “People have a lot of catching up to do. These guys are dominating when it comes to the Slams. These are the tournaments everyone wants to do the best in, and they're three out of five set matches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American men's players continue their search for an elusive Grand Slam title this month, hoping to be the one to end the drought. Former ATP number one Andy Roddick represents the last American man to win a Grand Slam title, having triumphed at the US Open in 2003. The nation's hopes of further success are now falling on a handful of players, namely Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton, Frances Tiafoe and Tommy Paul. And speaking on Tennis Channel, former American professional John Isner has now shared which of his compatriots he is most excited about on the ATP Tour. “He might take some early first round losses, which we saw in Queen's and Mallorca to Lerner Tien, but he picks up his level when the stage is big, so I expect him to play very well at Wimbledon. READ MORE: Learner Tien makes American tennis history after beating Ben Shelton in Mallorca He has such a big game, his serve is ridiculous. “I think Ben Shelton in my mind is the guy that has probably the best chance to break through in a huge event like Wimbledon in the next three to five years.” READ MORE: The next most likely American to win a Grand Slam following Ben Shelton's top 10 debut He is followed by Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz and German Alexander Zverev in second and third respectively, with Briton Jack Draper in fourth. Moreover, their female counterparts are doing their lack of success no favours, with Americans Madison Keys and Coco Gauff winning the 2025 Australian Open and French Open respectively. Fritz has come the closest to ending the painful men's drought in recent times, having lost last year's US Open final to Sinner. Also excited about Shelton is Brad Gilbert, but Jimmy Connors favours Tommy Paul for Wimbledon success over him and Fritz.</p>

American tennis pro Jessica Pegula suffered a stunning and early exit from Wimbledon in the first round on Tuesday when she was defeated in under an hour by 116th-ranked Italian, Elisabetta Cocciaretto. Cocciaretto, 24, managed to pull off her first-ever top five win at Wimbledon with ease, defeating Pegula in straight sets 6-2, 6-3. Elisabetta Cocciaretto of Italy celebrates winning her women's first round singles match against Jessica Pegula of the U.S. at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships in London on Tuesday, July 1, 2025. "To play here in such an unbelievable stadium and such an unbelievable tournament, it's a dream come true for me. I was so pumped to play Wimbledon this year," Cocciaretto said during her on-court interview following the match. Pegula's loss comes just days after she defeated Iga Swiatek in straight sets on grass to win the Bad Homburg Open in Germany. Unlike in her match against the five-time Grand Slam champion, Pegula struggled against Cocciaretto's aggressive play, hitting only five winners and making 24 unforced errors. Jessica Pegula plays a shot against Poland's Iga Swiatek during the final match at the WTA tennis tournament in Bad Homburg, Germany, on Saturday, June 28, 2025. I don't know how else to put it," she said after the match. But at the same time, I do feel like she played kind of insane. Kudos to her for playing at a high level that I couldn't match it today." Pegula's bad luck in the first round, which saw six of her first seven appearances at majors result in a first-round loss, came to an end in 2020, when she last lost to top-ranked women's pro Aryna Sabalenka at the French Open. Jessica Pegula of the U.S. leaves the court after losing to Elisabetta Cocciaretto of Italy during their women's first round singles match at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships in London on Tuesday, July 1, 2025. Tuesday's match was reminiscent of those early struggles. "This is definitely probably the worst result I've had all year," Pegula said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>33-year-old Nikoloz Basilashvili possibly caused the upset of the men's Wimbledon Championships 2025 so far, as he took out No. 7 seed Lorenzo Musetti in dramatic fashion on Tuesday. The Georgian produced a relentless attack and left his Italian opponent with no answers in the Round of 128 clash. Basilashvili struck 15 aces and 48 winners en route to a four set victory. He pushed Musetti from side to side, and the 2024 Wimbledon semifinalist had no answers to the shot making. On the other hand, Basilashvili brushed aside second set jitters to inch closer to the baseline and prevent Musetti from dictating rallies. Born in Tbilisi, Georgia in 1992, Nikoloz Basilashvili is a two-time entrant into the Wimbledon third round (2015, 2022). Having started playing tennis at the age of 5, Basilashvili currently has just as many singles trophies to his name. He played his biggest final at the 2021 Indian Wells Masters, where he lost to Cameron Norrie. Nikoloz Basilashvili made his Grand Slam debut at the 2015 Roland Garros – he lost in the opening fixture to Thanasi Kokkinakis. He has beaten the likes of Roger Federer (2021), Alexander Zverev (2019), Dominic Thiem (2017) as well as Stefanos Tsitsipas (2021), among others.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Athletic has live coverage from Day 2 at Wimbledon 2025. Some 20 hours after Taylor Fritz and Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard started a match that put Wimbledon's curfew under a microscope, their battle ended like it always seemed it would: in a tight fifth set, with the man who executed his big-time serve in the crucial moments just a little better coming out on top. Serving to stay in the match, Mpetshi Perricard missed four first serves, one second serve and two forehands as Fritz pulled off the strangest of comebacks from two sets down to win 6-7(6), 6-7(8), 6-4, 7-6(6), 6-4, after being two points from elimination the previous evening “I thought it would be all over last night,” said Fritz, the No. This last set was always going to a nervy one. The first four had ended just after 10:15 p.m. Monday night, after nearly three hours of roller coaster, tiebreak tennis between two of the biggest servers in the sport. Fritz had won more points and made fewer errors, but found himself down two sets to love after losing two tiebreaks to the Frenchman, who is one of the only players in the sport with a serve bigger than the American's. He hit the fastest in tournament history that first night, at 153 miles per hour, but Fritz blocked it back and won the point. But the American, who prides his competitiveness above his tennis skill, rode out the storm to win the next two sets, including a fourth-set tiebreak in which he rallied from a 5-1 deficit, two points from defeat. After doing so, he pumped his chest to his box, let out a cry of “let's f—ing go” and sat down ready to ride the wave of momentum to the finish line … or so he thought. After a protracted discussion with a tournament official, the match was suspended due to the Wimbledon curfew, which is at 11 p.m. local time, even though it was only 10:18 p.m. when play was stopped. “Then don't ask me,” Fritz said as he sat down in his chair and packed up his rackets, before saying to his box that he “couldn't do anything.” Mpetshi Perricard had the environmental advantage, playing under a roof on a fast court, able to fire at will without any sun or wind to worry about. Mpetshi Perricard wanted sleep – or maybe just a little more than a couple minutes to cool off from blowing the tiebreak and maybe the match. After it was over, Mpetshi Perricard said in his news conference that the decision was simple for him. He did not want to stop at 4-4 or 5-5 in a fifth set and come back the next day. Fritz said he understood that, but three-quarters of a day later, he was still a little baffled about how everything went down Monday night. “He just wanted me to agree with him,” Fritz said after his win. Stop asking me because you already said we're not playing. Fritz said he knew Mpetshi Perricard was better off playing indoors. He said he went to sleep knowing that his opponent was probably going to be thinking hard about that last tiebreak. “I think it would have been easy for me to get frustrated about not being able to play last night,” he said. “To be honest, I felt confident going into the fifth set if it was last night or today.” After the supervisor had made his decision, Mpetshi Perricard had grabbed his bag and walked off, like a man given a reprieve. And so, a little more than 17 hours later, they walked back onto the court. It is designed to “balance the consideration of local residents with the scale of an international tennis event that takes place in a residential area,” according to a previous statement from the All England Club. Unlike the other three Grand Slams, which run night sessions which can go into the early hours of the morning, Wimbledon stops play an hour before midnight without fail. Fritz served a double fault at 40-0, and then two points later, after another first-serve miss, Mpetshi-Perricard had the first of two chances to get to a break point, which would have been his first of the match. Fritz got his own serve back on track and survived. Mpetshi Perricard was four poor points from giving Fritz a chance to serve out the match. He didn't flinch, banging some of his biggest balls of the last set, though with air heavy and the balls picking up moisture from sweat and the grass, he didn't get close to his record-setting serve of Monday night. Fritz passed his own serve test at 4-4 with relative ease.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most mornings you can find DJ Bennett, Belleview's first tennis champion in school history, in Auburn's tennis training facility recovering from an oblique strain. Through rounds of dead bugs and planks, Bennett prepares for her next chance to qualify for the U.S. Open before her 22nd birthday. Just 10 years ago Bennett was forming the dream of playing professional tennis. In November, Bennett, Auburn's first NCAA women's singles finalist earned a slot in the first American Collegiate Wildcard Playoff. "Every young tennis player dream about it, but not many people get to say that they're actually doing it," Bennett said. July marks a busy run of tournaments for Bennett. Her first tournament of the month is the McLeod for Health Florence Open in Florence, South Carolina during July 21-27. The draws for each tournament haven't released yet but there's an opportunity for Bennett to win prize money and her first taste of the biggest stage in American professional tennis. "It was a long build up,” Bennett said. I had a lot longer like mentally to prepare, knowing that I was going to be playing that event for like seven months." Now that eight months have passed Bennett is a strong tournament run from her first opportunity to make the U.S. Open main draw, but the hunt is far from over. Bennett is still a rising star in her sport. Whether the 11-year-old girl who watches in wonder behind Bennett's mature exterior realizes or not the professional ranks are calling her name. "It could go to another American playing those tournaments, but it's still like a good opportunity and a good chance to have another shot at making it to New York in August."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John McEnroe is one of the most recognisable voices in tennis and he is back commentating at Wimbledon this year. His outspoken, rambunctious personality is an undeniable draw for tennis fans across the world, following on from his often high-profile playing career. The seven-time Grand Slam champion, who is an icon in large part due to his ‘you cannot be serious' mantra, weighed in on a discussion that has become commonplace in tennis discourse. Speaking on Monday evening while co-commentating for the BBC, Nick Mullins asked McEnroe if Alexander Zverev is now the best ATP player around yet to win a Grand Slam. Mullins interjected, putting forward Greek player Stefanos Tsitsipas as a possible candidate for the best ATP player yet to win a slam. McEnroe provided evidence-based analysis for his conclusion, pointing out Zverev's near miss at the 2020 US Open against Dominic Thiem. Thiem beat Zverev in an all-time classic, triumphing 2-6 4-6 6-4 6-3 7-6. It is no secret that Alexander Zverev has struggled to make an impact at Wimbledon throughout his playing career, having never made it past the fourth round. The German, who is seeking an elusive Grand Slam crown, faced off against France's Arthur Rinderknech on Monday night. Alexander Zverev saves four set points and levels vs. Arthur Rinderknech. 6-7(3), 7-6(8).Pretty BIG set for him as plays gets suspended right after.It's like a best of three sets match tomorrow.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Championships have begun, and the quintessentially British tennis tournament has some very particular codes for attendees to follow. Afternoon tea, a stiff upper lip and Wimbledon – all so deeply "British" that they've become part of the nation's international brand; the things that seem to make Britain, Britain, and tempt tourists from far and wide to observe them for themselves. It is a marker of "The Season", alongside the likes of the Chelsea Flower Show, Henley and Ascot, as well, of course, as being a place where balls are expertly hit by rackets. Its rules and the etiquette are paramount, both in terms of behaviour and dress – in other words, what to wear, and what falls a little long of the baseline. So what does the etiquette of Wimbledon entail? For starters, according to the self-styled queen of etiquette, Laura Windsor – who advised on the TV series Bridgerton –  don't call it Wimbledon. Attendees should, she tells the BBC, be behaving "with modesty… That's our Britishness, isn't it? For a start, avoiding many of the kinds of behaviours that are the norm at other sporting events, and instead behaving in ways arguably more in line with theatre-going, keeping things largely hushed, and not cracking out a selfie-stick – they were banned from the tournament in 2015. Although for British etiquette coach and author of Just Good Manners, William Hanson, "anyone who is still using a selfie-stick in 2025 should be monitored closely, anyway". According to Hanson, "while people love the social side of Wimbledon, it is worth remembering that it is a seated, sporting event that comes with its own set of court-side rules." He goes on: "Be punctual, and get in your seat in good time… respect the fact that you can only come and go during a changeover." But he also extends his guidance to how best to rally around the players, and officials, on court: “Be sporting with your support, and never cheer errors or mistakes. Avoid disturbing the players by calling out, and remember the umpire's decision is final – never heckle or question line calls." "Be aware of those sitting around you, and keep within the space of your seat – even if it is limited, try not to spill over into someone else's personal space accidentally." And, in case you were thinking about sneaking in a tuna melt, "avoid disturbing the peace by rustling wrappers or eating messy or smelly food". Most obviously, though, the rules are embodied in what to wear – "the best way to show good behaviour is by dressing appropriately," says Windsor. Plus certain items, such as ripped jeans, dirty trainers and anything with a political statement, are banned. "Be comfortable and appropriate for the weather," says Hanson, "but avoid anything that is overly casual or better worn at the beach". Unofficially, however, Wimbledon has developed its own set of style rules. Take for proof of these unspoken but still-tangible "rules" the criticism that Meghan, Duchess of Sussex faced from some corners for wearing jeans, alongside a hat and blazer, to watch her friend Serena Williams play in 2019. For Daniel-Yaw Miller, sports and fashion journalist and founder of the SportsVerse newsletter, "when you think about Wimbledon dressing, everyone has the same kind of thing in mind – either white or beige. Guests often favour floral frocks, polka dots and tailoring. By osmosis, a dress code seems to have been landed upon. For Windsor, dressing appropriately means "something that is demure and sophisticated," such as crisp linen and tailored pieces. While Hanson points out that "wide-brimmed hats are best avoided as they can get in the way of those sitting behind you," Panama hats have become something of an official Wimbledon uniform, popular in the audience from the start of the 20th Century. Zendaya, patron saint of "tenniscore", schooled Wimbledon-goers last year when she wore Ralph Lauren menswear-inspired looks – crisp white and old school tweed suit jackets, blue-and-white-striped shirts and ties. • Why Wimbledon players dress code is so strict Arguably, however, queen of SW19 dressing is Sienna Miller, thanks to her broderie anglaise dresses and easy-breezy linen suits, bright white Galvan jumpsuits and polka dots. Others have aced it despite not sticking to the script – see Grace Jones in a flight suit for a perfect example, or Idris Elba in a striking Super Eagles shirt. The presence of royalty every year underlines the event's sense of tradition, and tennis has long been associated with wealth, status and glamour. "Tennis was this social game, rather elite and glamorous," says Elizabeth Wilson, author of Love Game: A History of Tennis, from Victorian Pastime to Global Phenomenon –  its original setting was the country house. "It is, without doubt, a traditionally upper-class sport, and that essence still permeates through a lot of tennis," says Miller. He likens it to cricket, or Ascot, "where you have to be so respectful, as an outsider coming in, of the rules". "You look at other grand slams, [it] is the polar opposite," Miller says, mentioning some examples: walk-out music, players dancing as they come out, Kiss Cam, hot dogs for sale and T-shirt guns. "I see Wimbledon as essentially like a museum. You go there for a fascinating day out, for an insight into what the past of British society looked like," he says. "From a fan perspective, you're really made to feel like you're stepping into a space that is not yours," says Miller. Over the years, however, Wimbledon's codes have been shifting. In lots of ways Wilson thinks "it's more participatory [now]". In the past, "people have described how the atmosphere was more like a cathedral, there was a rather holy atmosphere – whereas that's very far from how it is today." "If we think of the Henman Hill/Murray Mound (and the rest), levels of patriotism and emotion, it is unlike public displays we would have seen in the past." Crowds do now whoop and shout, at least between points, and even partake in the occasional Mexican wave, which, according to Wilson, "nobody would have thought of doing in the 1950s". When Miller went last year, he "could definitely feel that it was a bit more of a modern tennis experience". Miller sees Idris Elba and David Beckham as shining examples of dressers who know how to be Wimbledon-appropriate without looking stuck in the past. "The look is more 'fancy barbecue' than 'super formal event'". "Etiquette is all about how our actions and behaviours affect or impact other people. We need to be considerate and careful in how we behave to ensure that everyone has a great day watching tennis. Wimbledon thrives on its age-old rituals, and remains one of the key traditional British summer sporting events – hopefully, for this special fortnight, we can all remember our manners, on court and off."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first round of Wimbledon continues on Tuesday, July 1. For Day 2 from the All England Club, I have Wimbledon predictions for two ATP matches: Dan Evans vs Jay Clarke and Tomas Martin Etcheverry vs Jack Pinnington Jones. Jay Clarke has been working for a while now to realize his potential at the tour level, so it's almost unbelievable that he's still just 26 years old. It's just as unbelievable that he's found his way back to Wimbledon for the first time in three years, but given the state of British tennis right now, he was able to secure a wild-card. With that said, his game has aged well in the past few seasons, given his presence as more of a cerebral player, and now that his body seems to be cooperating with him, the results have been there. Evans is a prime candidate for grass with prowess on the serve-and-volley and an effective backhand slice that will make his opponent hit a bunch of uncomfortable shots from inside the baseline. Even if Clarke were feeling comfortable here, he'd still be outclassed, so it's just a bonus that Evans has a distinct edge on this surface against the youngster, who's just 11-35 on grass across all levels. After taking out the likes of Frances Tiafoe, Miomir Kecmanovic and Tommy Paul in recent weeks, I'm betting on Evans being close to his previous form — which would be good enough to earn him far more respect in the market. He's a bit behind schedule, but now that he's graduated from TCU young Jack Pinnington Jones has finally turned pro and has made it into the Wimbledon draw for the first time in his career. Grass has been a learning experience — which is the case for any young player given the short grass schedule — but hailing from Great Britain he's had the benefit of tuning up for Wimbledon a bit longer with five wins in nine matches. At least two of those grass-court losses came against quality opponents, and his last three matches have all come in three sets versus some more experienced talent. Now, he'll have a golden opportunity to showcase his talent against one of the coldest players on tour, Tomas Martin Etcheverry. Once ticketed for big things on all surfaces, Etcheverry has seemed to lose sight of what he does best. The Argentine has lost his last two matches heading into play here — not counting an exhibition he played a few days ago — and it should be said that despite his strong defense, his game is not really a fit on this surface. He's won just five times in 16 grass matches, and even on clay — his favorite surface — he's been awful this year with an 8-11 record. Etcheverry is down on confidence, he's missing more than ever, and now he's going to compete with a rising talent in front of a hostile crowd.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka has opened up about how she was blindsided when controversial Aussie Nick Kyrgios made an unexpected appearance in her coaching box at Wimbledon. Disrupted by knee and wrist injuries, Kyrgios will not be involved as a player at Wimbledon, making this the third consecutive year he has missed out. Last year the 30-year-old was a part of the BBC's punditry team, alongside Tim Henman and John McEnroe, but was not included this time around. Kyrgios was also overlooked by ESPN this year despite featuring on their panel at the Australian Open, and previously worked for the Tennis Channel and TNT Sports. Naomi Osaka got her Wimbledon title tilt off to a good start by defeating Talia Gibson 6-4 7-6 However, the Aussie firebrand is at the event this year after securing a punditry role with TalkSport - and on day one of the tournament he watched Osaka in action on Court 18. Kyrgios, who is signed to Osaka's management group, is set to play mixed doubles with the Japanese star at the US Open in August. Following her 6-4 7-6 win over Talia Gibson, Osaka was asked about Kyrgios in her player's box and she admitted she had no idea he was there. I did not hear anything, OK,' she said. 'Yeah, I think that's also a big part of why we're different is because I know he kind of tells his box what to do, and he probably would have noticed if I was in there. Kyrgios' last appearance on the court at Wimbledon came in 2022, when he lost the men's singles final to Novak Djokovic 'I guess it is cool that he was there.' Kyrgios has been tormented by a succession of injuries in the last two-and-a-half years and has only played six singles and three doubles matches since the start of 2023, winning one of each. Only two of the 20 current top-10 male and female players have to date declined to put their names forward in a victory for the organisers' rebrand, the creation of which drew condemnation from regular doubles players including Australia's Ellen Perez. Men's No.1 Jannik Sinner has paired with American women's world No.9 Emma Navarro and men's No.2 Carlos Alcaraz with former US Open winner Emma Raducanu. Women's No.1 Aryna Sabalenka has linked up with men's No.19 Grigor Dimitrov. Men's No.9 Holger Rune and women's No.2 Coco Gauff are the current top-10 players not to have entered so far, nor have Australian No.1s Alex de Minaur and Daria Kasatkina - the entry window closes on July 28. However, de Minaur said he and his British fiancée Kate Boulter, currently world No.39, were planning on doing so. 'If that's an option, then we'll definitely be up for it.' Kyrgios and Osaka would need a wildcard, being ranked 633rd and 57th respectively, but given the revamp is aimed at attracting more fans, viewers and sponsors there is little doubt such a high-profile duo would get one.
