                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since Supernatural concluded in 2020, the actors have had the opportunity, after fifteen years dedicated to a beloved long-running show, to expand their careers. The most successful has been Jensen Ackles, who has performed in smaller roles like the ones in Big Sky and Tracker as well as major roles like starring in the new crime thriller series, Countdown. Despite this, it seems the actor has not given up on his previous role, admitting to the audience that he's always willing to return to the small screen as Dean Winchester. Previously, fans of Supernatural have been given hope that the show will return, especially when the actors or showrunners mention "what if" scenarios about a revival. However, Jensen Ackles' latest interview has given viewers even more hope, especially when he expresses not only his desire to return to the show, but others, including the renowned showrunner, Eric Kripke. Supernatural ended five years ago after becoming the longest-running fantasy TV show in the U.S., breaking records and developing an extremely dedicated fanbase. The actor has had several iconic characters but credits one specifically for his career. In fact, the controversial aspects of Supernatural only encouraged the audience to demand more, which has led to constant interest. Most shows that have been concluded for several years will see a significant decline in activity, especially when there seems to be nothing left to discuss or theorize about the future of the storyline. Despite having been over since 2020, the fandom continues to grow, and more viewers are taking an interest in the future of Supernatural. Fans continue to show up at Supernatural conventions and express their interest in a revival on social media, making the main cast, mainly Jensen Ackles (Dean Winchester), Jared Padalecki (Sam Winchester), and Misha Collins (Castiel), aware of their desires. Even Jensen Ackles, who has had a successful career starring in The Boys, Tracker, and his new TV show, Countdown, emphasizes how he has been influenced by playing Dean Winchester even years after the show ended. Recently, on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Ackles was asked about a potential Supernatural revival, and he replied that the series is "always hanging out there," according to TV Insider. Though he mainly talked about how Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins would guest star in the last season of The Boys, this reunion was due to their history working together. In addition, they're aware there will always be a fanbase for the fantasy TV show, giving the viewers hope that one day they will revive the series for another exciting storyline. While many Supernatural fans have not stopped talking about a revival since the series concluded, that doesn't mean there still isn't a significant amount of criticism for the fifteen seasons already available. This clarifies that even though the show is still popular and worthy of another installment, the narrative is not perfect and has a fair number of unpopular scenes and plots that were not popular among viewers. Supernatural's "Swan Song" is hailed as Eric Kripke's perfect finale to the series, but his ending is actually much darker and unsatisfying. Many viewers are still upset about certain character deaths, the lack of diversity or focus on supporting characters, and the contentious conclusion. There are many ways in which the showrunners could address these fan complaints with a revival. Following the finale of Supernatural, there are some reunions that viewers never received, such as Castiel being brought back from the Empty by Jack but never reuniting with Sam or Dean Winchester. Other fans point out that the new world following a new God taking control was never explored, leaving too much about the finale up for interpretation. A continuation of Supernatural, even with a limited runtime, could answer some major questions and satisfy the fans with a more well-rounded conclusion to the renowned fantasy TV show. Viewers don't just want a Supernatural continuation that takes place in the same world as the flagship series. While this may seem impossible because both brothers have died and gone to Heaven, the show has proven that anyone can be brought back if there is a reasonable explanation. After Supernatural ended, the hopes that the show would eventually get a revival were perceived as wishful thinking by a dedicated fanbase that didn't want to see their favorite show end. Despite this, the main stars have proven that it isn't just the audience that wants a revival. Based on how important these characters were in building these actors' careers, and how they have expressed an interest in returning, it is more likely than ever that Supernatural will eventually be revived. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Jensen Ackles spoke to CBR about his new police thriller Countdown and whether he's wrapped filming The Boys. Since its release, Netflix's new crime series has been extremely popular. Rewatching Sons of Anarchy 17 years later reveals bloated pacing, inconsistent characters, and outdated themes that dull its former outlaw edge. The comedy show has constantly had good audience scores, which led to a renewal. Although Stardust has flown under the radar for far too long, Henry Cavill's appearance should force the audience to praise it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Colorado Representative Lauren Boebert isn't going to turn down a chance to do the conspiracy thing, even if she probably thinks it's all an inside joke. Right-wing media love conspiracies because they tend to be a fairly fact-free preoccupation, where politics can easily be grafted onto a story without having to endure any real scrutiny. Boebert appeared on "Prime Time with Alex Stein," which, as MTN/Meidas News points out, is broadcast on Glenn Beck's right-friendly Blaze TV. In 2023, Joe Rogan and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen delved into a layered conspiracy theory about U.S. nuclear tests being faked. I say "layered" because Andreessen suggested that they were faked to intimidate the Russians – it was a clever psyop. Boebert went with the flow on this one and then started babbling about submarines. Of course, it's not difficult to find out why the cameras survived – they were elaborately shielded. What was interesting about the exchange between Boebert and Stein was that while Stein was clearly just screwing around, Boebert had to play along with the conspiracy theory while simultaneously defending the Pentagon's decision to bomb Iran's totally, completely real nukes program. But why stop with debunked tales about phony nukes? Let's go for some bigger fish: next up, the bogus Moon landing! There were six "successful" crewed Moon landings, so they must all have been staged! But the Van Allen conspiracy angle isn't hard to dismiss – due to mission planning and spacecraft shielding, NASA ensured that the astronauts absorbed little more than a medical x-ray's worth of radiation. Boebert and Stein topped it off with Tucker Carlson's bolstering of the theory that so-called "Building 7" at the World Trade Center must have collapsed as a result of a controlled demolition because it wasn't struck by a jet airliner on 9/11. It actually caught on fire and collapsed as a consequence of some thoroughly understandable structural failures. Conspiracy theories put Boebert in a good mood, and why wouldn't they? Shockingly, Boebert and Stein failed to indulge in some comedy around the granddaddy of them all; somehow, the JFK assassination didn't come up.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are plenty of conspiracy theories to come out of the White House over the years, with everything from what really happened to JFK to 'faked' Moon landings, allegations about Barack Obama's citizenship to the death of Jeffrey Epstein keeping tinfoil hats in business for decades. More recently, the July 2024 assassination attempt of Donald Trump has set tongues wagging. While on the campaign trail near Butler, Pennsylvania, Trump was shot in the ear and wounded by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. Although Crooks wasn't successful in taking out the future President of the United States ahead of his second term, he killed one audience member and critically injured two others before he was shot dead by the Secret Service's Counter Sniper Team. Away from theories that Donald Trump uses a body double, conspiracy theorists are back claiming that something fishy went down at the rally. Images of a defiant Trump raising his fist in the air after being shot, the aftermath saw him sporting a giant bandage on his ear. Some of his MAGA supporters even took to wearing their own bandages in support of him, but after showing off his healed ear in recent photos, some think there's more to the story. With the POTUS' ear looking as good as new, less than a year after the incident, users on X are claiming it was all an elaborate hoax. Another added: "Here's what people are missing: He's not even brave or strong enough to cut, slice, or pierce his ear to make it appear the whole thing was real. Another added: "Here's what people are missing: He's not even brave or strong enough to cut, slice, or pierce his ear to make it appear the whole thing was real. Not everyone was convinced, with someone else chiming in: "Y'all realize he's a billionaire right? You don't think the world's best plastic surgeons can repair an ear?😂😂😂." Another concluded: "Dudes head gets blown off/ Liberal nut jobs: I think it was fake!" Someone even asked Elon Musk's chatbot what it thinks. Misinformation, like old photos, fuels skepticism but doesn't hold up." With cartilage implant reconstructive surgery being around for decades, and it being true that we can even grow an ear in a lab, this one might be debunked before it can even take off. While we're not saying that Trump has had a new ear grown on the back of a mouse and then attached to his head, this could be a conspiracy theory to park in the 'debunked' pile alongside Melania Trump blinking Morse code for help.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's human nature to change your mind and be one with the group. To stay quiet and under the radar — but be careful. As in the new book, “The Ghosts of Gwendolyn Montgomery” by Clarence A. Haynes, denying who you really are can be deadly. Beautiful, talented, and driven, Gwendolyn Montgomery's touch was magic. Everyone who wanted to be famous knew that she alone could make it happen, that her work at Sublime Creative could make someone a legend like Gwendolyn herself. Working long hours with whiny, demanding stars was fine, but Gwendolyn wanted companionship. She was lucky she met James, who was sweet and kinda geeky, not perfect, but better than another one-night stand. It was terrible when the same thing happened at an event she'd done for her baddest, most spoiled client. That super-hot incubus was literally only the man of Fonsi's dreams, though, and so Fonsi renounced love and threw himself into being a part-time psychic and running La Playa, a store for believers in the spiritual. He loved that store and his customers but lately, he'd noticed that something was wrong and his BFF's mother, Estelle, also a psychic, confirmed it. El Intermedio, the spirit world, was roiling and they needed someone with more power to help hold the spirits back. Someone like Fonsi's long-estranged cousin, also a Guardián, wherever she was… If you're like a lot of people, you pick up a book, skim the first few pages, and make your decision: to read or not to read. Do that with the beginning of “The Ghosts of Gwendolyn Montgomery” and you'll be tempted to put it back. Trust this, though: despite that it's a jumble at first, you won't be sorry if you stay. Whether you believe in ghosts or you scoff at the idea of a spirit world, this novel will satisfy your cravings with lots of hair-raising moments and one or two moderately-explicit eyebrow-raisers, along with an intriguing back-story that includes a bit of mystery. But it's not all boo-who: author Clarence A. Haynes injects enough excitement and humor to keep even the most sober-minded reader entranced with a plot that's twisty fun.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Its creation alone has raised over $5,800 (about £4.2k) for the American Alzheimer's Association so far. We wrote about the plans to livestream this mod's creation last month. Their creation, Transmission Zeta, is now available to download via Nexus Mods. It looks like a fun time, though you might not dig the questline it offers if you're not down for plenty of silliness and Fallouty meta humour. In line with what viewers voted for during a June 14th planning stream, that questline is all about aliens. You'll investigate with the aid of Clark, a zany conspiracy theorist voiced by Johnson, and the mod's fully-voiced follower, a vault dwelling con artist called Arlen. The 40 hour Modathon is over, and you raised just shy of 10k across our events - and there's still one more to go!Amazing work from all the modders who poured themselves into this!Join @GopherGaming and @WesJohnsonVoice tomorrow to watch the reveal of what we've assembled! As you play through the quests and explore a new dungeon, one of which is called "V.A.T.S in Spaaace! In order to start the mod's questline once it's installed, the modders write that you'll need to "simply pass through any load screen by fast traveling or entering and exiting a building", at which point a strange new radio station will pop up on your Pip-Boy. If you are planning on playing the mod, you'll need version 1.10.163.0 or greater of Fallout 4 and all of its DLC aside from Far Harbor and the high-res texture pack. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to investigate this weird blue light that's just begun beaming down from the heavens outside my house.
