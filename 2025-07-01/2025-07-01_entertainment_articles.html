                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE UPDATED: Amazon MGM Studios‘ adaptation of Rebecca Yarros' bestselling novel Fourth Wing may be getting a big-name new showrunner. Agatha All Along and WandaVision creator Jac Schaeffer has signed a deal with the studio and is also in discussions to board the high-profile romantic fantasy series project as writer, executive producer and showrunner, sources tell Deadline. She would succeed Moira Walley-Beckett who recently left after being tapped to pen the adaptation last July. According to sources, Schaeffer is among the top names in consideration for the job, with no showrunner decision made yet. Amazon MGM Studios' United Artists & Scott Stuber Take Rights To Freida McFadden's Bestseller Thriller 'The Tenant' Amazon MGM Studios & Sony Pictures Ink Multi-Year International Theatrical Distribution Deal There also has been an addition to the Fourth Wing producing team as Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy's Amazon MGM Studios-based Kilter Films (Prime Video's Fallout, The Peripheral) has joined Michael B. Jordan's Outlier Society, which had been on board since Amazon MGM Studios secured the rights to The Empyrean book series in 2023, along with Premediated Productions. A rep for Amazon MGM Studios declined comment. Planned as a five-book series, with Fourth Wing (2023), Iron Flame (2023) and Onyx Storm (2025) as the first three titles, The Empyrean follows twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail as she leaves the life of a Scribe behind at her mother's demand that she become a dragon rider. Fourth Wing has spent 88 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, 18 of them at #1. WandaVision was Emmy-nominated for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series and also earned Schaeffer writing Emmy and WGA Award nominations. Most recently, Schaeffer directed and executive produced the pilot for Disney+'s Holes reboot. She is repped by CAA, Curate and attorney Erik Hyman.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Broken out we're seeing $130M+ abroad with the dinos dropping into Australia, Brazil, Mexico and the Netherlands on Thursday. On Friday, they head to France and India, among others. Universal theatrical release will hit stateside tomorrow (not tonight) at 4,000 theaters before upping to 4,300 by Friday. The studio doesn't really believe in previews on discount Tuesday and has generally launched hard on Wednesday. Universal is taking a majority of the PLF screens away from Apple Original Films and Warner Bros' F1 which will hold onto its Imax gas for what's hoped to be a $28M+ second 3-day or better. RELATED: 20 Of The Most Anticipated Movies Coming Summer 2025: From ‘Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning' To ‘Jurassic World: Rebirth' We always have to asterisk the fact that moviegoing can ratchet down due to barbeques, beach, swimming pool and fireworks on the July 4th holiday. If there's heat on a title, then that theory is thrown out the window, however, distributors would love it if Independence Day didn't fall on a Friday. 1 opening wins for Uni include 2021's F9 ($70M 3-day), 2022's Minions: The Rise of Gru ($123M 4-day) and last year's Despicable Me 4 ($122.6M 5-day). While Universal restarted the Steven Spielberg-born franchise in 2015 with Jurassic World under the directing watch of Colin Trevorrow with new cast members Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, that movie is still the biggest opening in the 32-year old franchise at $525.5M worldwide (unadjusted for inflation) and $208.8M domestic, the previous movie, 2022's Jurassic World: Dominion, despite grossing $1 billion including $157M from China, seemed to have run its course story-wise. Rotten Tomatoes critics' rating fell to its lowest across the six-picture franchise at 29%. Despite an A- CinemaScore (the lowest ever for a Jurassic movie was the Joe Johnston-directed 2001 Jurassic Park III with a B-), it was decided then an injection of Viagra and Testosterone was needed for these pre-historic beasts, enter returning scribe David Koepp who adapted the first two Michael Crichton penned novels, Jurassic Park and The Lost World: Jurassic Park, for the big screen (the author co-wrote the first 1993 movie with Koepp). Also, let's not forget a director who knows something about large lizards and genre, Gareth Edwards, who helmed the first Legendary Monsterverse title, 2014's Godzilla, which did just over a half billion worldwide, and the prequel, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which did $1.05 billion. The Earth's atmosphere has become inhospitable to dinosaurs, hence they are now confined to rainforest areas around the Equator. The three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their DNA, the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind. Scarlett Johansson, a gun for hire (and not any girl with a gun, hello, it's Black Widow herself, Johansson! ), leads a bio-research team who has their greedy eye on making that new drug. Two-time Oscar winner Mahershala Ali plays the Johansson's character's friend with the boat, Rupert Friend is the bad guy, Jonathan Bailey plays a doctor with a sense of decency and they're all in the way of creatures with big claws with a shipwrecked family in town (played by Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Luna Blaise, David Iacono and Audrina Miranda as the Delgado family). What are audiences thinking about this reboot? Overall first choice is close to where 2018's Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was (the fourth film in the series), that pic directed by J.A. Still, we expect this one to perform.Each of the most recent trio of movies ultimately went on to gross over $1B-plus globally, led by 2015's huge franchise return, Jurassic World with $1.67 billion, still the tenth highest grossing movie ever. China contributed a sizable chunk to each of those three films, and while Rebirth leads presales through Sunday in that market, times have changed meaning it's a wait-and-see how it delivers. Along with China, the recent Jurassics have performed the best in a mix of Mexico, the UK, France, Germany, Australia, Korea and Japan (again, the latter not going this weekend).Universal unveiled extended footage for exhibitors at CineEurope in Barcelona last month, and it was roundly one of the most positively talked about sneak peeks.Among other travel for the Jurassic World Rebirth crew, there was a world premiere in London on June 17, followed by Berlin the next day. A Grand Rex red carpet was held in Paris on June 22 with Edwards and score composer Alexandre Desplat. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. I mean it's so bad that audience members were actively rooting for the monsters to win . I say monsters because these aren't dinosaurs. The giant Rancor monster in all the ads has about 3 minutes of screen time and it's a useless mobster at best . There is a family thrown in to the movie for diversity reasons is my guess and you will want them all to die after spending 5 minutes with them . It's no wonder the WB bots are review bombing this movie. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>English punk-rap duo Bob Vylan have issued a new statement following their controversial “death to the IDF” chants at Glastonbury over the weekend, denying claims of antisemitism while continuing to call for a free Palestine. “We are not for the death of Jews, Arabs, or any other race or group of people,” the duo wrote in a post on Instagram on Tuesday. “We are for the dismantling of a violent military machine — a machine whose own soldiers were told to use ‘unnecessary lethal force' against innocent civilians waiting for aid. BTS Slate Spring 2026 Return With New Music and World Tour Scooter Braun Steps Away From CEO Role at HYBE Bob Vylan garnered significant criticism over the “death to the IDF” chants during their set last weekend, with Glastonbury organizer Emily Eavis writing that their words “very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.” Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau wrote on X on Monday that “foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country.” The BBC also shared a statement saying the network regretted livestreaming Bob Vylan's Glastonbury set, further stating that “the antisemitic sentiments expressed by Bob Vylan were utterly unacceptable and have no place on our airwaves.” And whatever sanctions we receive will be a distraction,” Bob Vylan said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. There is so much to love about FX's “The Bear.” From its technical precision to its culinary exhibition and intimate, chaotic character work, this vivid kitchen drama had no business being the megahit that it's become. Season 4 is the show's weakest, if only because Christopher Storer and Joanna Calo set such a high bar in previous seasons. IndieWire's spoiler-free review noted a dulled momentum when it came to key plot development and character growth. The mouthwatering food closeups still work wonders (really, all of the closeups — including those which place viewers so close to an actor's face that you can practically read their mind), the dialogue still flies almost faster than Tina's pasta (Liza Colón-Zayas), and there are more Faks than ever (though, unlike Season 3, it doesn't feel like it). Related Stories Lena Dunham Took an ‘Intentional Break' from Public Life Post-‘Girls': ‘I Felt Confused' After Media Backlash Jennette McCurdy's ‘I'm Glad My Mom Died' Set for Apple TV+ Series Starring Jennifer Aniston But even after an objectively solid batch of episodes, “The Bear” feels stuck. Proma Khosla: I can't preface this enough with the fact that I do genuinely enjoy “The Bear.” It's one of those shows that I got into after the rest of the world had been raving about it (including IndieWire dot com), and that can sometimes turn people away from extremely popular shows. I go through some version of it every season as all TV writers steel themselves for The Discourse. We hold good shows to high standards that they set for themselves. Season 2 raised the bar for “The Bear,” and Season 3 felt like I blinked and it was over with no tangible movement. Season 4 felt the same, and I think it's because, as your review noted, we seem to be treading water for 10 episodes while waiting for a character to make one, maybe two key decisions. Ben Travers: Over the weekend, a disheartening paragraph from an interview with Stripe CEO Patrick Collison was making its way around Bluesky. enthusiast complaining that watching “long-form, lots-of-episodes TV is a waste of time,” but there's an easy solution: Just ask your favorite A.I. That way, you know what happened, and you're spared the inconvenience of feeling anything, forming your own opinions, or connecting with anyone via a medium literally made to bring large swaths of humanity together for a shared collective experience. Now, I don't think “The Bear” quite qualifies as “long-form, lots-of-episodes TV” — there's only 40 episodes, and they're mostly less than 40 minutes apiece — but I do think Collison's anti-human perspective illustrates a pervasive issue in entertainment: prioritizing plot over everything else. “What happens” isn't the basis for great storytelling. After all, do we love when Kevin Garvey (Justin Theroux) crawls out of the ground in “International Assassin,” or do we love all the insane little steps it takes for him to get to a point where he can crawl out of the ground? We're living in an age where TV programmers seek out shows the audience only has to half-watch, which tends to negate any potential emotional connection between viewer and story while encouraging an over-dependency on things happening to shock the viewer into paying attention, and “The Bear” is living in that age, too. All this is by way of explaining I don't take lightly what I'm about to say: “The Bear” lost the plot. But more vexing to me than the prolonged character arcs — these are good characters, portrayed through great performances, so they can carry a little extra water — is the show's growing comfort with denying closure. Leaving so much up in the air at the end of Season 3 was annoying and illustrated how little “The Bear” cooked up in those 10 episodes, but at least it had the excuse of “to be continued”; Storer and Calo knew it was a half-season, and admitting as much bought them time to wrap things up in Season 4. Season 4 starts with, as you alluded to, a literal ticking clock. When Computer's digital timer goes off, the restaurant is screwed. So why, oh why, does the season end with the timer going off and no actual answer to whether or not Syd (Ayo Edebiri), Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), and Natalie (Abby Elliott) have a restaurant to co-own or not? The ending we'll get to a little later, but it's just one example of Season 4's incomplete courses and sweet (maybe saccharine?) vibe shift, so please, Proma, take the mic: What else frustrated you about the latest edition of a show we both very much enjoy? I would also love to see them perhaps do something, apart from yelling at each other in various locations and the bare minimum of self-reflection. We both agree that “Worms” was a missed opportunity to let Edebiri really soar (and Danielle Deadwyler — if you have her, you use her! ); while she's still delivering a great performance, I just wish it wasn't the fifth time she had to portray Sydney dithering over a big decision that we could all predict from a mile away. Conversely, I was electrified the one scene she shared with Will Poulter as Luca, rekindling a chemistry we saw at the end of Season 3 and which is begging to be explored — but it was once again limited to that single scene. The same goes for sparks between Richie and Jessica (Sarah Ramos), who deserve for their sexually-charged tie-adjusting to lead to something more. I'm happy for him, but even that arc took place entirely off-camera and left the audience with no choice but to just get on board. Over the course of four seasons, Calo and Storer have leaned into what their show does best, but it's starting to feel like active rejection of other storytelling techniques that wouldn't necessarily hurt the quality. Ben: After spending five minutes piecing together who “Ted” is based on context clues and a quick Wiki search, I can now wholeheartedly agree with your points before proffering another: The monologuing has to stop. By that, I don't mean “The Bear” has to jettison every lengthy speech or chat the writers pen for their talented cast. I just mean the episodes don't have to wildly vacillate between moody, music-driven montages and concentrated, one-sided conversations. Season 4 has Syd's strained “sleepover” debate with herself in Episode 4; Kate Berlant's opening Al-Anon monologue that builds to a joke you could see coming from the start; Donna (Jamie Lee Curtis) laying it all out there while making amends to her son; Syd's hospital confessional to Claire (Molly Gordon), and Carmy and Claire's confrontation on the stoop — which is technically a hefty piece of dialogue, but when your dialogue sounds like a monologue, that's probably the first sign it needs a good edit. Whether there was more monologuing this season than in the past is a question for someone with a better memory than myself, but even if the total was similar, the tone was too lopsided. “”Unfinished” goes back to the relationships that have or haven't come to fruition and the fate of the restaurant itself — plot details, if you will — but “unresolved” applies to how much Carmy & Co. have grown, changed, and done right for themselves. Richie mocking Carmy for using the phrase “retired” might be the most I've laughed all season, in part because “Good luck, Admiral. We'll send you your watch” is a great quip, but also because I kinda believe him? Nor do I think abandoning his family to start over with Claire (as Carmy obviously intends) is the right thing for a guy who, as Richie says, is constantly running away. Technically, the finale addresses these complaints, so maybe I just need to shut up and respect people's choices. But we literally don't know whether Richie, Syd, and Natalie have jobs, nor do we know if they'll be happy in their new intended positions at The Bear. This isn't a series meant to end with that level of ambiguity, and it's also not a series that has to punt on a legitimate series finale just because it delivered another dissatisfying season finale. “The Bear” may be headed toward an ending, but it's not there yet. Proma: Listen when you're right, you're right — and I'm not just saying that so that Luca and Sydney can kiss (not entirely). I can't imagine these very talented writers went into those meetings waxing about ownership agreements and giant clocks. There had to be a vision — if not a map — for where Carmy, Richie, Sydney, and the rest were going, and my hope is that this protracted season is in service of that vision. Carmy's incremental growth is triumphant even as he inches along, and a highlight of Season 4 was seeing just how far Syd and Richie have come since being party to a workplace stabbing in Season 1. This is a massive ensemble and while I don't expect everyone to have their story tied up with a bow — excuse me, garnished with an edible flower — nearly everything ended in a place that left us wanting more. Yes, Richie and Carm finally talked about their tension and Mikey's funeral, but can't we see how their dynamic shifts? Marcus texted his father and got a “Food & Wine” shoutout, but what does that mean for their relationship, and his place at The Bear moving forward? Ebraheim (Edwin Lee Gibson) is going to franchise the Beef window, but can't we see how it does? And is Tina going to get a medal for winning the pasta Olympics? There's a difference between leaving something open-ended and ostensibly giving up on resolution, and Season 4's individual endings fall scattered across this spectrum. So despite having too much of “The Bear,” I hope we get more of “The Bear.” Maybe I'm just not ready to say goodbye, and if I've learned anything from this show it's that you often don't get to — not on your own terms and not neatly. But TV creates chances we don't get in life, and these characters deserve a final course for the ages. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

The hitmaker attended the Renaissance Tour in 2023; that year, she was hit with an ongoing lawsuit from three former backup dancers accusing her of sexual harassment and toxic work conditions, all allegations Lizzo has vehemently denied. “I was so nervous,” she told the publication, noting she was worried that people in the crowd would “boo me or be like, ‘F–k you. When fellow attendees instead embraced her with encouraging remarks, Lizzo says she was inspired to pull herself out of that dark period. “It made me feel like, ‘Wow, maybe I don't want to die. Lizzo has since embarked on a fitness and mental wellness journey, re-emerging stronger and more self-assured than ever ahead of the release of her upcoming album, Love in Real Life. But things were dark for quite some time, according to the musician, as the legal action against her made her question everything. I used to walk into glam and be like, ‘Oh, let me tell you about this crazy s–t that happened last night!' The backup dancers' lawsuit came in August 2023, with the plaintiffs accusing Lizzo of pressuring them to touch nude dancers at a club, commenting on their weight and private sex lives, and forcing her religious beliefs on them. Some of those claims were dismissed by a judge in 2024, but the lawsuit was still ordered to move forward; in June, however, Lizzo filed an appeal aimed at shutting it down for good on the grounds that the dancers' claims clashed with her First Amendment rights. Again, Lizzo denied any wrongdoing, with her attorneys calling the claims “meritless and salacious.” “I never attempted to kill myself or thought about it, but I did think, ‘If everyone hates you and thinks you're a terrible person, then what's the point? Despite everything, the businesswoman knows she always has Bey. The Destiny's Child alum's discography is a go-to for Lizzo during her workouts, and the “Truth Hurts” artist even got a personal shout-out from Bey on many nights of the Renaissance Tour during “Break My Soul (The Queens Remix)” — something that made Lizzo cry when she witnessed it in person. “In that moment I was thinking about baby me, listening to Happy Face by destiny's child and crying myself to sleep because of bullies,” she wrote on Instagram shortly afterward.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the cause of death has not been publicly disclosed, tributes to the late actor have flooded social media from fans, former co-stars, and entertainment peers. Among those remembering Hurst is Ben Jones, who portrayed mechanic Cooter Davenport on the series. Jones, 83, shared a deeply personal message on Facebook, honoring his longtime friend and co-star. “It doesn't seem right that Rick Hurst passed away this afternoon. When something so unexpected happens, it is ‘harder to process', as the current expression goes,” Jones wrote. “I have known Rick for over 45 years and there wasn't a minute of that time that he didn't leave me smiling or laughing. Jones continued, highlighting Hurst's professional achievements and kind spirit. “I don't know about y'all but I believe in an afterlife, and I can see Rick up there in Heaven with [deceased Dukes of Hazzard cast members] Jimmy Best and Sorrell Booke and Denver Pyle, putting on the funniest show inside those Pearly Gates.” Fans across various “Dukes of Hazzard” fan pages echoed Jones' sentiments, sharing memories of Hurst's warmth, humor, and dedication to his supporters. Though decades have passed since the series aired its final episode, the bonds formed on and off screen remain as strong as ever, evident in the outpouring of love following Hurst's passing. As fans continue to celebrate his contributions, both comedic and personal, Hurst is remembered not just as Deputy Cletus Hogg, but as a beloved friend, actor, and light in the lives of many.</p>

Bill Hader is swapping the dark comedy of “Barry” for pure animated fun — while staying under the Warner Bros.

Alessandro Carloni and Erica Rivinoja co-write and co-direct “The Cat in the Hat.” Earlier this year, Carloni said during a Work in Progression session at Annecy, via Deadline, that WBD's 2023 shelving of “Coyote vs. Acme” was sadly “representative of how painful and atrocious the industry can be,” especially for animated films. (“Coyote vs. Acme” was later sold to Ketchup Entertainment in 2025 and will receive a theatrical release next year.) Hader will serve as co-showrunner with Zelman and also executive produce, with Hader set to direct should the project move forward at HBO. A source told IndieWire that Hader could potentially star in the series as Jim Jones as well. “Saturday Night Live” alum Hader previously won two Emmys for Best Actor in a Comedy for “Barry.” The series itself garnered 16 total Emmy nominations for writer/director/creator Hader across its four seasons.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senate Republicans have passed President Donald Trump's so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” a sprawling legislative package that is expected to kick millions off their health insurance, codify big tax cuts for the wealthy, give a massive funding boost to the administration's mass deportation efforts, and screw over the nation's poor with cuts to social services. “This was an incredible victory for the American people,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) told reporters after the vote went final. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) broke with their party and voted no on the legislation. Tillis announced earlier this week that he would not be seeking reelection after Trump said he would work to primary him amid his opposition to the bill. “I'm telling the president that you have been misinformed,” he said. “You supporting the Senate mark will hurt people who are eligible and qualified for Medicaid.” The bill will now be returned to the House of Representatives for passage with amendment, and then sent to the desk of President Donald Trump, who has demanded Congress pass his signature legislation by the Fourth of July.

Scooter Braun is transitioning out of his role as CEO of HYBE America and will become an executive advisor as a director of the board and senior advisor to HYBE chairman/CEO Bang Si-Hyuk, the company announced today (July 1). In addition, Braun will be pursuing new ventures outside of HYBE while still being involved with the company. Braun, who is still HYBE's second-largest individual shareholder, first joined HYBE in 2021, when the South Korean company purchased his Ithaca Holdings. He then served as co-CEO of HYBE America alongside Lenzo Yoon until January 2023, when he became sole CEO; a source tells Billboard Braun's transition serves as the conclusion of his initial contract with HYBE. Succeeding him as CEO of HYBE America will be Isaac Lee, who had previously been chairman of the division and chairman of Latin America and will add the chief executive title to his remit. We wish him immense success in his exciting next chapter and look forward to continuing our partnership in executing HYBE's global vision.” As HYBE America CEO, Braun oversaw Big Machine Label Group — which he had initially purchased through Ithaca Holdings for $300 million in 2019 — and Quality Control Music, which HYBE acquired for $300 million in 2023, among other interests. His next move, while currently unknown, is said to “reflect his expansive cross-industry vision and proven ability to cultivate culture at scale while continuing a focus on his philanthropic efforts,” according to a press release. What he has built with HYBE is unparalleled. I am incredibly proud of our collective accomplishments and look forward to supporting Chairman Bang and CEO Jason Jaesang Lee in their continued success as I step into what's next.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

Luckily, this doesn't seem like a project critics want any sort of distance from. Sentimental Value was a huge hit at Cannes, where it won the Grand Prix this spring. Now it has a trailer for the rest of us, which you can watch below: “I can't work with him,” Nora tells Rachel Kemp (Elle Fanning), a young American actress who takes on the role Gustav had previously offered his daughter. The film's official synopsis reads as follows: “Sisters Nora (Reinsve) and Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas) reunite with their estranged father, the charismatic Gustav (Skarsgård), a once-renowned director who offers stage actress Nora a role in what he hopes will be his comeback film. When Nora turns it down, she soon discovers he has given her part to an eager young Hollywood star (Fanning). Grab a box of tissues and head to theaters for Sentimental Value, premiering November 7.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran still has the components needed to build a nuclear weapon after President Donald Trump ordered airstrikes on its nuclear sites, even as military hardliners dissatisfied with the weakness shown by their country's clerical leadership are poised to gain greater control, multiple sources tell Rolling Stone. “The System is under pressure and extreme constraints now that it is militarily weakened — not to mention Israel's proven ability to dominate their airspace. There's little sign any of the belligerents agree about what they want to happen next. Israel, which says the primary goal of its attack was to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, had also encouraged Iranians to overthrow their government. Fissile material for civil use is enriched to a low grade — around five percent purity — while weaponized applications require highly enriched uranium, as pure as 90 percent or more. “Color me a little bit skeptical until we have more data.” The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which oversees compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), released a report on May 31 that noted Iran was stockpiling highly enriched uranium and conducting other “illicit” activities. “Iran can convert its current stock of 60 percent enriched uranium into 233 kilograms [513 pounds] of WGU [weapon-grade uranium] in three weeks at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, enough for nine nuclear weapons,” wrote analysts at the Institute for Science and International Security, a think tank specializing in non-proliferation, in their analysis of the IAEA's report. Kristi Noem Secretly Pocketed Cash From Dark Money Group: Report Rick Scott Demands More Cuts to Medicaid, Which His Company Allegedly Scammed Findings like that formed the basis for claims that Iran was close to getting a nuclear weapon, but whether it was trying to do so is as much a question of political intent as physical capabilities. Neither Israeli nor U.S. officials provided any direct evidence that Iran had begun building a bomb since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, touching off Israel's current confrontation with Iran. Amid criticism from Trump and MAGA loyalists, she has since reversed her public stance, posting on X recently that “Iran is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly.” Prior to the strikes, a robust monitoring and inspection regimen was essential to keeping tabs on Iran's nuclear program, and analysts at the Institute for Science and International Security asserted that moving forward: “The urgent need is to place IAEA inspections at the heart of relations with Iran and reaffirm that Iran will never be allowed to get a nuclear weapon.” Whether this is intended as leverage during potential future negotiations is unclear, but if the IAEA is kicked out, the international community loses visibility about Iran's nuclear program — even as internal pressure to “break out” and make a dash to build a weapon becomes critical. IAEA officials have said Iran has 900 pounds of highly enriched uranium, and analysts spoken to by Rolling Stone believe at least some of this was dispersed from Fordow prior to American strikes, but acknowledge lacking any specific details. There are also outstanding questions about Iran's existing enrichment centrifuges. In 2018, Trump withdrew from former President Barack Obama's 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. Tehran then prevented the IAEA from monitoring at that site. As a result, “we knew that they had produced hundreds of advanced centrifuges. We just didn't know where they were,” Vaez says. In a post-attack analysis published on Tuesday, the Institute for Science and International Security asserted that “Overall, Israel's and U.S. attacks have effectively destroyed Iran's centrifuge enrichment program.” But it also noted: “That being said, there are residuals such as stocks of 60 percent, 20 percent, and three to five percent enriched uranium and the centrifuges manufactured but not yet installed at Natanz or Fordow. These non-destroyed parts pose a threat as they can be used in the future to produce weapon-grade uranium.” It's unlikely that U.S. and Israeli military operations have fully accounted for all of these centrifuges. Despite whatever level of destruction was achieved at the Fordow enrichment site, there remain uranium hexafluoride production and enrichment facilities at the complexes in Natanz and Isfahan, which were largely untouched. “You cannot ‘obliterate' a program if you still have both centrifuges and enriched uranium up to the 60 percent level that still exists,” Sen. Chris Murphy told reporters last Thursday, after receiving a classified briefing about the strikes. “A few dozen advanced centrifuges could fit in a relatively small room and would have no detectable footprint, and could be used in order to enrich up to 90 percent, if you have the 60 percent stockpile as feed,” he says. “With their 60-percent stockpile, they can get enough fissile material for a single nuclear weapon in six days, and they can have enough for an arsenal worth in less than a month,” Vaez tells Rolling Stone. “The bottom line conclusion here is that Iran's nuclear weapons capacity has been reduced. But its intent to acquire nuclear weapons has increased,” Vaez says. Whether its intent has increased or not, certainly there was no regime change. IRGC militias have set up surprise checkpoints, are searching people's phones for incriminating information, are conducting mass arrests, and have carried out multiple executions. Iranians largely rallied around the flag despite widespread discontent with the System, which proved its resilience by continuing to function despite Israel's attacks on its leadership. “They understood that the leadership could be decapitated either through assassination or precision strikes.” Israel killed top IRGC commanders when its Operation Rising Lion began in mid-June. Many of these were veteran leaders fully invested in the strategic patience strategy — central to Iran's response after the U.S. assassinated an influential IRGC commander, Major General Qasem Soleimani, in 2020. Tehran launched six short-range ballistic missiles against the U.S. airbase at al-Udeid in Doha, Qatar — all of which were shot down by Patriot air defense batteries. Indeed, social media has been a key front in this conflict, and modern militaries are becoming more sophisticated about how they engage with it, says Matthew Ford, the author of War in the Smartphone Age, and a professor of War Studies at the Swedish Defense University in Stockholm. Ford notes in particular Israel's online showcasing of its intelligence and military prowess during Operation Rising Lion. Indeed, as Rolling Stone has reported, Trump appears to have changed his mind about becoming involved in the conflict after seeing how Israel's operation was playing out on Fox News. Governments seek to impose a top-down information strategy in an effort to control the narrative, but this is increasingly difficult in the era of “participatory media,” Ford says. Both Israel and Iran took steps to limit information — with Israel imposing a media clampdown in reporting on ballistic missile strikes and seeding memes about its operations across social media, while Iran simply cut off internet access for much of its population. The United States also used deception aimed at online audiences. After a Trump spokesperson said he would take action “within two weeks,” keen-eyed observers breathlessly tracked groups of U.S. B-2 Spirit stealth bombers and refueling aircraft online, using publicly available flight data to follow them moving west, apparently on their way to Guam. Chatter online and on TV is also central to managing the domestic political response. “Time and time again, classified information is leaked or peddled for political purposes to try to make the president look bad, and what's really happening is you're undermining the success of our incredible pilots,” said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in a press briefing at the Pentagon last Thursday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>[Editor's note: The recap of Squid Game‘s finale publishes July 2.] “Sky Squid Game,” its 2024 successor, is the blackest of black comedies imaginable: a bunch of men voting, loudly praising democracy, and murmuring their agreement on the reasonableness of tossing a baby off a cliff. In my recap of “222,” I worried that this embrace of the show's more satiric elements would have negative impacts on its human storytelling. Situations can be absurd—this show thrives on creating them—but things get trickier when that absurdity invades the human mind. Credit where it's due, then, because “Circle Triangle Square,” the show's penultimate installment, defied my concerns and threaded the needle between realism and satire with surprising grace. It's goofy, yes, as each member of the O crew “spontaneously” puts forth a “reasonable” argument for why their fellow players should offer themselves up to die. (Song Yong-chang, who's been doing great work throughout these two seasons as old bastard Im Jeong-dae, is genuinely hilarious here, pivoting shamelessly every time the situation shifts.) Of course, we only get to said peaks because Seong Gi-hun ultimately decides he's not going to murder his and the baby's way to victory, a notion dispensed of in an especially strong cold open that sketches in at least part of why Front Man Hwang In-ho Is The Way He Is. Turns out, back in 2015, when he was just a player, In-ho was given the exact same option (and knife) that Gi-hun has been given now: Faced with certain death (and goaded to action by game founder/original 001 player Oh Il-nam), he plunged that blade into the necks of a bunch of sleeping people who would have killed him first, making him the winner of his version of the games by default. Lee Byung-hun has been a fantastic performer pretty much every time we've gotten him out of his Dollar Store Darth Vader mask throughout the show's run—it's one of the big things I've missed in the transition from Squid Game 2 to Squid Game 3—but he's absolutely spellbinding here: first as the clearly traumatized In-ho in the flashback and then as his modern incarnation, watching with silent…something…as Gi-hun (pulled back from murder at the last minute by his memories of Sae-byeok) finally proves himself the better man. There is at least something to No-eul's (very long) fight with her former middle-manager, who apparently bonded with her over leaving people behind in North Korea. (In his case, it was apparently due to a lack of transplantable organs, so that's that character beat/criminal smuggling ring explained.) Taking place in In-ho's office (because that's where he keeps paper copies of the amusingly named Squid Archives), this sequence goes on for a long time, but ultimately never develops much beyond “woman forced to abandon her child betrays evil organization to save other child, man gets mad about it.” He gets the drop on her, she gets the drop on him, she gets stabbed, he gets shot, nobody threatens to throw a baby off of anything, and it's all kind of a wash. No-eul survives, gets rid of the hard copy of 246's records and another couple of things get ticked off the show's plot checklist. (The boat stuff, meanwhile, is even more slight: 246 gets into a running gunfight with some Pink Guards and is saved when Jun-ho and The Other Guy Who's With Jun-ho come across him in their boat. Truly, it's a joyous confluence of maritime coincidences. I'm continually dismissive of this material, not because No-eul and Jun-ho aren't decent enough characters—although they both tend to be pretty flat in practice. traditional action sequences aren't Squid Game's strong suit, as the season-two finale pretty ably demonstrated. these bits contribute nothing to the show's over-arcing themes. Jun-ho just really wants to find his brother; No-eul just really wants to save some guy she knows from work. There's not much more to their stories than that. At no point, during either of these plotlines, do I feel like I'm getting much insight into how the games work or how they're meant to reflect on society. Standing on top of lethally high towers, they'll have fifteen minutes to push at least one (living) member of their group off, allowing the survivors to move to the next edifice. But their pronouncements about “fairness” and the “democratic” process keep running, hard, into the practicalities of murder in ways that give “Square Triangle Circle” a queasy tension it might have otherwise lacked. How, for instance, do you get the baby away from Gi-hun, so that each can be killed in a one-per-tower fashion? And once a target has been safely picked, how do you actually get them off the ledge without going over yourself? None of this psychological math is made easier by Myung-gi, who's secretly running his own program separate from everybody else. It all nearly works, as the surviving Os immediately identify the path of least resistance/stabbings and swiftly turn on one of their own to be a “lunch box,” beating him mercilessly so that they can throw him off the ledge as soon as the Circle tower's game has started. But, wouldn't you know it, Gi-hun's altruism just won't bite: His insistence on actual fairness, with the surviving six adults drawing lots to see who dies last, kicks off a final fight that depletes the supply of available victims quickly. It's a lot to parse, especially because there's not room here to chart out every single shift of alliance, authority, pragmatism, and self-serving rhetoric that goes down on those two towers. The aggregate, though, is a pleasant whiplash between dark comedy and just pure darkness, with men trying to find the right combination of lofty words that will make a noble act out of the cowardly murders they're trying to commit. Watching Myung-gi maneuver, and the cracks form in Jeong-dae's supposedly solid alliance, is a pure distillation of all the ugly things Squid Game has had to say about capitalist democracy ever since the voting concept was introduced. The result isn't as draining as “The Starry Night,” because it would be hard for anything to match that particular ordeal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eva Longoria's absence from Lauren Sánchez and Jeff Bezos' lavish $50 million wedding in Venice quickly sparked speculation — especially considering her longtime friendship with the bride. Per Page Six, Longoria was in Spain filming the latest season of her CNN travel series, “Eva Longoria: Searching for Spain”, during the three-day celebration. She was also supporting her husband, José Bastón, who recently underwent shoulder surgery. The couple was photographed relaxing on the beach in Marbella that same weekend, with Longoria adjusting Bastón's sling before sharing a kiss — a moment that quickly made headlines. Though the timing led some to question whether there was a rift between Longoria and Sánchez, sources confirmed there is no tension between the two women. In fact, Longoria was one of the celebrity guests at Sánchez's bachelorette party in Paris just weeks before the wedding. She appeared in photos alongside Kim Kardashian, Katy Perry and Kris Jenner, and even shared a moment holding hands with Sánchez during the celebration. According to TMZ, the actress was enjoying some downtime between filming commitments for her CNN series, which is now in its third season. Days later, she posted a carousel of photos on Instagram wearing a sunny yellow halter mini dress while posing barefoot in her garden. She captioned the post with a series of emojis: “🍋🌱🌼💚”. In 2024, The Hollywood Reporter featured a conversation between the two women, where they opened up about their friendship and long-standing commitment to giving back. Sánchez, vice chair of the Bezos Earth Fund, awarded Longoria the $50 million Bezos Courage and Civility Award to support the Eva Longoria Foundation, which provides educational and economic opportunities for Latina women and girls. “You and I constantly have these conversations that inspire each other,” Longoria said during their chat.</p>
