                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After 13 years of deploying robots into its warehouses, Amazon reached a new milestone. This one millionth robot was recently delivered to an Amazon fulfillment facility in Japan. That figure puts Amazon on track to reach another landmark: Its vast network of warehouses may soon have the same number of robots working as people, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal. The WSJ also reported that 75% of Amazon's global deliveries are now assisted in some way by a robot. The company also announced it's releasing a new generative AI model called DeepFleet for its warehouse robots. Amazon trained the model on its own warehouse and inventory data. Amazon's one millionth robot represents more than just a number. The company has improved its fleet of robots in recent years, adding new capabilities and models. In May, the company unveiled its latest robot, Vulcan. This model has two arms, one designed for rearranging inventory and another with a camera and suction cup to grab items. Most notably, these Vulcan robots have a sense of “touch” that allows it to feel the items it is grabbing, according to Amazon. In October 2024, the company announced its “next-generation fulfillment centers,” which would include 10x as many robots as their current facilities, in addition to human workers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Startups working on AI-powered e-commerce tools often rely on external data or user signals to build and improve their models. However, a company called Remark is taking a different approach by letting thousands of human experts chat with users while they are purchasing items, and then using that knowledge to train models. Remark also makes those experts “available” all the time by having their AI-powered persona answer questions. The startup on Tuesday announced $16 million in Series A funding led by Inspired Capital with participation from Stripe, Neo, Spero Ventures, Shine Capital, and Visible Ventures. Remark joins a number of startups that are plugging AI into various areas of e-commerce, such as search, try-ons, chatbots, and dynamic page generation that is suited for AI-powered experiences. While these companies operate in different areas, merchants can only spend so much to enhance their online experience. While Remark previously depended on a cut of the sale to generate revenue, the company has moved to a SaaS-based (software-as-a-service) model for better cash flow and now takes a fee based on site traffic. “The reason for low conversion rates on e-commerce sites is that people have a lot of questions when they shop. “At Remark, we want to bring that kind of expertise to online shopping for our partners,” Satloff said in a call with TechCrunch. If a user is looking for pots and pans, the site could ask what kind of stovetop they have, or if they use diesel, induction, or gas. When the user clicks on one of these questions, a chat interface opens where they're matched with an expert who can offer advice about buying an item. Remark matches an expert with a user based on skill set and locale, it says. If an expert is not available, the user is matched with an AI bot based on those experts who can help them with their shopping. Satloff said Remark works with a variety of accreditation agencies to verify the expertise of the people who work with them. (This is akin to Airbnb adding various experience providers for its platform.) They are also paid when their AI persona converts a sale. While the startup didn't provide an exact figure for the average earnings that an expert receives, it said its top 20% earn $60,000 to $70,000 per year by spending more than 15 to 20 hours a week offering advice. When a user activates a chat, experts get a notification on their phone on Remark's app, and they have five to eight seconds to claim the chat and respond to the buyer. Following its $10 million fundraise in 2024, Remark has seen 4x revenue growth. It also increased its network of experts from 50,000 to 60,000. Kamran Ali, a principal at Inspired Capital, said that Remark's utilization of human insights was an important factor in the VC firm investing in the startup. The amount of AI-generated content we see today is dramatically more than a year ago, and there's no end in sight. So, having human insights and preferences will actually be at a premium, and that's what attracted us to invest in Remark,” he told TechCrunch over a call.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After pushing the TikTok sale date back yet again, President Donald Trump said in an interview on Sunday that he had found a potential buyer for the ByteDance-owned platform. Though the president said he will not reveal the identities of the buyers for another couple weeks, Bloomberg is reporting that the buyer is a group of investors from Oracle, Blackstone, and VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). According to the report, these investors had made a bid, but it lost momentum amid tensions between the U.S. and China due to Trump's tariff proposals. Oracle has long been engaged with TikTok as part of its Project Texas initiative to make sure that U.S. user data is stored in the States.

The milestone droid was deployed to a fulfilment center in Japan. In a press release, the company also revealed it has a new generative AI foundation model that will help improve robot fleet travel efficiency by 10%, supporting faster delivery times and reducing costs for consumers. Crucially, WSJ reports that Amazon is now on the brink of having more robots in its warehouses than humans. Per the report, the majority of Amazon's 1.56 million employees are warehouse staff, but the biggest cohort of Amazon's "employees" could soon be its army of robots, which it uses to pick orders from shelves, move goods ready for packaging, sort items, and more. Ultimately, that should mean lower costs and faster delivery times for consumers. Amazon says DeepFleet is essentially an intelligent traffic management system for its robots, which move like cars across a congested city. The company has come a long way from its original warehouse robots. Now, it has an entire fleet of different models. Specifically, Amazon highlighted the Hercules, which can move 1,250 pounds of inventory, and Pegasus, which uses a precision conveyor belt to handle individual packages. There's also Proteus, Amazon's first fully autonomous mobile robot, which can move around employees while moving heavy carts. While the burgeoning future of AI and robots might seem like a threat to jobs in some instances, Amazon says the opposite is true. The company claims it has helped upskill 700,000 employees to work with more advanced technologies, and that robot grunt work is freeing up its employees to earn more technical skills. Amazon one day hopes to turn warehouse robots into assistants that can even respond to verbal commands from employees, and is also testing a humanoid robot with legs, arms, and a head.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WhatsApp is adding more AI features to its business suite. WhatsApp Business, which has over 200 million monthly users, has been a notable revenue driver for Meta, as its executives noted in the last few quarterly earnings calls. While the company doesn't charge for its AI features at the moment, there is a possibility that it could put a price tag on that after it achieves scale. Today, small business accounts can already chat with customers over voice on WhatsApp, but larger business accounts haven't yet had the ability. (The latter wasn't available during earlier tests last year, but is now.) WhatsApp said it will soon add a way for customers to send and receive voice messages from businesses, too. By enabling voice pipelines, companies could set up an AI-enabled voice agent through a startup like Vapi, ElevenLabs, Coval, or Phonic to run their customer service over WhatsApp. In addition, an AI-powered chat-based customer support and outreach feature that began testing last year is now being expanded to more merchants in Mexico.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta is one step closer to releasing AR smart glasses with built-in displays. These will not be the Orion smart glasses that the company showed off last year (glasses that reportedly cost $10,000 to make a single pair, but more likely a watered-down version, according to leaked images and videos of the so-called “Meta Ceres” (codenamed “Meta Hypernova”) AR glasses. X user @Lunayian (via RoadtoVR) shared several images and videos of what they claim are the Cerese smart glasses and their corresponding electromyography (EMG) wristband controller. At first glance, the two devices look like a pair of Ray-Ban Meta AI smart glasses and a Whoop fitness band. Here's that EMG band in action, showing a pinching gesture. There's also a touch-sensitive panel on the temples of Celeste where a user can touch to capture photos and video. Similar to Orion, Celeste might even let you game—just a little bit. Ultimately, Meta's main goal is to release a pair of AR smartglasses that let you open several apps at once. In my Orion demo, I could use multiple apps, including Instagram, a web browser, and a video call, and see them all floating transparently in front of my eyeballs. According to Bloomberg, Meta is targeting around $1,000 for its first AR glasses. There's also still a lot we don't know. Orion required a rather large wireless compute puck to handle much of its graphics processing. The veracity of these leaks can't be confirmed, but someone would have had to go through a lot of trouble just to fake them. It's likely we'll find out more at Meta's annual Connect developer conference happening September 17 through 18. Mark Zuckerberg is hellbent on beating everyone to AR glasses. It's been long-rumored that Tim Cook is pushing for a pair of AR glasses, though the company settled with Vision Pro first because the technology to shrink AR into a pair of eyewear isn't there yet. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel announced at AWE last month that the company's first AR glasses are coming next year. Without showing any images or videos, he described them as “lightweight” and “immersive,” which we can only take to mean they won't look like the goofy, oversized (but standalone) developer versions of Specs (see below) that Snap has been letting devs and creators fiddle with. And, of course, Google is going to come guns blazing with Android XR, which will likely launch with hardware from a bunch of brands, just like other Android phones and tablet devices. Have some thoughts on how it compares to Meta's Orion AR glasses pic.twitter.com/IQlyRHPT6g Time is of the essence for Meta and Zuck if they really want to own our faces as the next computing battleground. Meta fumbled big time with the whole metaverse that never materialized in VR, but now it's pivoted everything—pouring tens of billions of dollars a year—into AR and AI. Zuck and company can shove Meta AI into every app it owns, but at the end of the day, they're still apps experienced mostly through phone screens.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than a decade after the acclaimed Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, DK is returning with Donkey Kong Bananza to add some much-needed variety to the Switch 2 lineup. Its initial launch lineup—though filled out with third-party games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Yakuza 0 Director's Cut—has been light on Nintendo first-party games, relying heavily on Mario Kart World to sell console bundles. The game signals a welcome shift in Switch 2's lineup, moving from competition with friends into more classic exploration and puzzle solving. (An adult version of Pauline is also present in Super Mario Odyssey.) During a demo event held in New York, WIRED spent some hands-on time with the game, including exploring different environments in its subterranean layers and the game's co-op mode. The environments are highly destructible, from top to bottom, and it's therapeutic to spend your time windmilling DK's hammy arms through the floor itself. The demo we played included some light puzzles, most of which involved pulling out chunks of explosive materials to break open new paths or kill enemies—straightforward, but still satisfying. Donkey Kong's sidekick Pauline is an important part of his adventure, both in story and practice. Her singing powers can temporarily transform DK into other animals, like an ostrich that grants you the ability to glide through the air. The game has a light leveling system that you can sink points into to expand DK's powers, including his animal abilities. Pauline, too, is playable, albeit in a different way. She's constantly glued to DK's back, and she attacks by absorbing elements around her and shooting them back out in word-shaped attacks. Pauline, on top of playing a smaller role in co-op, is also trickier to control. Where DK can be maneuvered at the player's discretion, Pauline is at the mercy of where it is DK wants to go. Our demo focused on the console's mouse controls, which made the whole experience feel far more frantic than focused for me as someone who prefers to use a controller. Donkey Kong Bananza is goofy, easily digestible, and enjoyable to spend time with. Although Nintendo's lack of first-party games that would make the console a must-own so far doesn't seem to have hurt its sales, industry analyst Mat Piscatella tells WIRED that a new console's real test is about the months after launch, especially around the first holiday season. “Donkey Kong Bananza should certainly help over the summer months, when the available supply of Switch 2 hardware should finally catch up to demand,” he says. “It would likely be helpful if a few more big releases were announced for the holiday period to continue the launch momentum,” he says.

Hong Kong-based GPU manufacturer Inno3D, which shares a parent company with Zotac, has just released benchmarks for the RTX 5050. This GPU launched last week and is only priced at $249, allowing budget gamers to buy into the RTX 50-series family for 1080p gaming. Although the RTX 5060 also has 8GB of VRAM, it uses GDDR7 and features more CUDA cores for better performance. It also has a higher MSRP of $299, and you can expect add-in board partners to put a premium on some variants. However, the latter has 4GB more VRAM and a larger memory bus of 192-bit (over the RTX 5050's 128-bit memory bus). Inno3D's tests show the RTX 5050 outperforming the RTX 4060 in several 3DMark tests, including Steel Nomad, Speed Way, Port Royal, Fire Strike Ultra, and Fire Strike. It seems that the budget gamers will get a base-level 50-series GPU that can perform almost as well as a higher-tier GPU from the previous generation. The Intel B580 is an attractive alternative, though, because of its higher VRAM — if you can find one, that is. Or if you can spare an extra $180, consider getting the RTX 5060 Ti (16GB) instead, as you'll likely struggle with just 8GB of VRAM. We recommend holding off on any purchases until you've seen an in-depth review on the RTX 5050 — that way, you can make the most of your hard-earned money. Make sure to click the Follow button.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Only a handful of Turing ‘GTX' cards will remain supported after the 580 drivers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. According to an official Nvidia Unix graphics feature deprecation schedule, driver branch 580 will be the last to include support for these architectures (h/t Longhorn on X). As Nvidia maintains a unified driver codebase, it looks pretty certain that this Unix schedule will also apply to Windows drivers. The key statement of intent from the updated schedule is as follows: “The release 580 series will be the last to support GPUs based on the Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta architectures.” Though it looks pretty certain to apply to Windows, too, we have reached out to Nvidia to remove any doubt regarding the support for GTX 900 and GTX 1000 cards on Windows. The company wasn't immediately available for comment. However, some GTX cards based on Turing were also produced and proved quite popular among budget buyers. Owners of graphics cards from the GTX 16 series, based on Turing GPUs, will have the dubious honor of rocking the last supported GTX graphics cards from Nvidia. That means popular cards like the GTX 1660 Super will continue to get driver support into the 590 drivers era, and probably beyond. The last time Nvidia gave notice that it was killing off support for a graphics architecture was back in 2021. Despite the lack of mainline updates, Nvidia still went on to deliver some subsequent updates for security patching purposes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, once a powerful alliance, now appears completely broken. In a new escalation overnight, the U.S. President and the world's richest man traded a series of threats that have formalized their political divorce. In a fiery rant on Truth Social early Tuesday, Trump deployed one of America's oldest and most charged political insults, telling the billionaire CEO to “head back home to South Africa.” “It is obvious with the insane spending of this bill, which increases the debt ceiling by a record FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS that we live in a one party country – the PORKY PIG PARTY! It is obvious with the insane spending of this bill, which increases the debt ceiling by a record FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS that we live in a one-party country – the PORKY PIG PARTY! Time for a new political party that actually cares about the people. “Elon Musk knew, long before he so strongly Endorsed me for President, that I was strongly against the EV Mandate,” Trump wrote. “Electric cars are fine, but not everyone should be forced to own one.” He then pivoted from policy to a direct, personal assault. “Elon may get more subsidies than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,” Trump continued. “No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE.” The “go back home” line is a historically loaded nativist trope, often used to question the legitimacy of immigrants and naturalized citizens. By invoking Musk's South African birth, Trump is using a powerful rhetorical weapon that suggests his opponent, despite being a U.S. citizen since 2002 and the head of critical American companies like SpaceX, is not a “real” American and is therefore disloyal. Trump concluded his post with an ominous suggestion aimed at the very government agency Musk himself created and led, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). “Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this?” Trump wrote. He reacted defiantly on X, demanding that all government subsidies be eliminated. “I am literally saying CUT IT ALL,” the billionaire posted in reply. He then hit where it hurts by targeting President Trump's leadership and supporting one of his chief Republican critics, Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky. After a user on X urged support for Massie's reelection campaign, Musk replied with a simple, two-word promise: “Me,” confirming he would be donating.

After Musk attacked his signature spending bill, the U.S. president threatened to turn Musk's own government agency, DOGE, into a "monster" that would "go back and eat" him. The tech billionaire has had it with the “Porky Pig Party," and he wants to replace it with something new. "Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty," Musk tweeted.

Synology has begun selling its newest SNV5400 enterprise NAS SSDs, and the asking prices for what you receive are nothing short of shocking. For a 1.6 TB NVMe SSD at PCIe Gen3 speeds, Synology is asking $535 on B&H Photo Video, while many competing devices retail for around $100. The new SNV5400 family, which also includes 400GB and 800GB models, is one of only a few Synology-branded SSD families compatible with certain Synology NAS models due to the company's new restrictive compatibility requirements. Synology recently announced its plans to require the use of approved SSDs for certain NAS systems. Synology's newest drives, which were first seen online at a gobsmacking €620 from one Newegg shop, are priced comfortably above any other similar models in the industry. What's more, the SNV5420's endurance is vastly outclassed by its competitors; Western Digital's WD Red SN700 SSD, another PCIe 3.0 NAS drive, advertises a TBW of 5100TB, nearly double what Synology offers. The SNV5420 1.6 TB NVMe drive will launch for $534.99 from B&H Photo Video, with other sources selling the drive for more. While these may be pre-launch prices, they are still likely in line with the product's MSRP. Synology's website advertises that its newest drives are "purpose-built for Synology NAS," advertising a hefty R&D testing process and features like power loss protection. But even other enterprise M.2 drives (a less-common form factor for the true enterprise market) with PLP and other big-time features do not scratch the pricing of Synology's newest outing. While some loopholes exist for using non-approved drives in newer Synology NAS units (like this one written in German), eventually Synology customers may be forced to pay the hefty Synology tax for their off-the-shelf NAS solutions. Perhaps independent testing reveals some fairy dust in the new units that deserves its hefty upcharge, but we haven't found any from Synology's own site just yet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company will also introduce a "pay-per-crawl" system to give users more fine-grained control over how AI companies can access their sites. Cloudflare will also give clients the ability to manually allow or ban these AI bots on a case-by-case basis, and it will introduce a so-called “pay-per-crawl” service that clients can use to receive compensation every time an AI bot wants to scoop up their website's contents. The bots in question are a type of web crawler, an algorithm that walks across the internet to digest and catalogue online information on each website. In the past, web crawlers were most commonly associated with gathering data for search engines, but developers now use them to gather data they need to build and use AI systems. However, such systems don't provide the same opportunities for monetization and credit as search engines historically have. AI models draw from a great deal of data on the web to generate their outputs, but these data sources are often not credited, limiting the creators' ability to make money from their work. Search engines that feature AI-generated answers may include links to original sources, but they may also reduce people's interest in clicking through to other sites and could even usher in a “zero-click” future. “Traditionally, the unspoken agreement was that a search engine could index your content, then they would show the relevant links to a particular query and send you traffic back to your website,” Will Allen, Cloudflare's head of AI privacy, control, and media products, wrote in an email to MIT Technology Review. Cloudflare claims its clients can now allow or disallow crawling for each stage of the AI life cycle (in particular, training, fine-tuning, and inference) and white-list specific verified crawlers. Clients can also set a rate for how much it will cost AI bots to crawl their website. “Community platforms that fuel LLMs should be compensated for their contributions so they can invest back in their communities,” Stack Overflow CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar said in the release. Crawlers are supposed to obey a given website's directions (provided through a robots.txt file) to determine whether they can crawl there, but some AI companies have been accused of ignoring these instructions. Cloudflare already has a bot verification system where AI web crawlers can tell websites who they work for and what they want to do. For these, Cloudflare hopes its system can facilitate good-faith negotiations between AI companies and website owners. “A web crawler that is going across the internet looking for the latest content is just another type of bot—so all of our work to understand traffic and network patterns for the clearly malicious bots helps us understand what a crawler is doing,” wrote Allen. While this approach will still apply for the truly bad actors, the company says it hopes its new services can foster better relationships between AI companies and content producers. Some caution that a default ban on AI crawlers could interfere with noncommercial uses, like research. Not all AI systems are commercial,” says Shayne Longpre, a PhD candidate at the MIT Media Lab who works on data provenance. “Personal use and open research shouldn't be sacrificed here.” “By verifying a crawler and its intent, a website owner has more granular control, which means they can leave it more open for the real humans if they'd like,” wrote Allen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some people believe chatbots like ChatGPT can provide an affordable alternative to in-person psychedelic-assisted therapy. He picked up his phone and typed a message to ChatGPT. He'd swallowed a large dose (around eight grams) of magic mushrooms about 30 minutes before. Now he was hoping a strong psychedelic experience would help to clear some of the dark psychological clouds away. Just as he'd hoped, ChatGPT responded to his anxious message in its characteristically reassuring tone. “I'm sorry to hear you're feeling overwhelmed,” it wrote. “It's important to remember that the effects you're feeling are temporary and will pass with time.” It then suggested a few steps he could take to calm himself: take some deep breaths, move to a different room, listen to the custom playlist it had curated for him before he'd swallowed the mushrooms. (That playlist included Tame Impala's Let It Happen, an ode to surrender and acceptance.) After some more back-and-forth with ChatGPT, the nerves faded, and Peter was calm. But this is a potentially dangerous psychological cocktail, according to experts. Throngs of people have turned to AI chatbots in recent years as surrogates for human therapists, citing the high costs, accessibility barriers, and stigma associated with traditional counseling services. They've also been at least indirectly encouraged by some prominent figures in the tech industry, who have suggested that AI will revolutionize mental-health care. “Will lead to a radical improvement in people's experience of life.” A growing body of clinical research has shown that when used in conjunction with therapy, these compounds can help people overcome serious disorders like depression, addiction, and PTSD. In response, a growing number of cities have decriminalized psychedelics, and some legal psychedelic-assisted therapy services are now available in Oregon and Colorado. Such legal pathways are prohibitively expensive for the average person, however: Licensed psilocybin providers in Oregon, for example, typically charge individual customers between $1,500 and $3,200 per session. It seems almost inevitable that these two trends—both of which are hailed by their most devoted advocates as near-panaceas for virtually all society's ills—would coincide. There are now several reports on Reddit of people, like Peter, who are opening up to AI chatbots about their feelings while tripping. These reports often describe such experiences in mystical language. “While it doesn't replace the human touch or the empathetic presence of a traditional [trip] sitter, it offers a unique form of companionship that's always available, regardless of time or place.” Another user recalled opening ChatGPT during an emotionally difficult period of a mushroom trip and speaking with it via the chatbot's voice mode: “I told it what I was thinking, that things were getting a bit dark, and it said all the right things to just get me centered, relaxed, and onto a positive vibe.” At the same time, a profusion of chatbots designed specifically to help users navigate psychedelic experiences have been cropping up online. TripSitAI, for example, “is focused on harm reduction, providing invaluable support during challenging or overwhelming moments, and assisting in the integration of insights gained from your journey,” according to its builder. “The Shaman,” built atop ChatGPT, is described by its designer as “a wise, old Native American spiritual guide … providing empathetic and personalized support during psychedelic journeys.” Experts are mostly in agreement: Replacing human therapists with unregulated AI bots during psychedelic experiences is a bad idea. Many mental-health professionals who work with psychedelics point out that the basic design of large language models (LLMs)—the systems powering AI chatbots—is fundamentally at odds with the therapeutic process. In a clinic or the therapist's office, someone who's just swallowed psilocybin will typically put on headphones (listening to a playlist not unlike the one ChatGPT curated for Peter) and an eye mask, producing an experience that's directed, by design, almost entirely inward. The therapist sits close by, offering a supportive touch or voice when necessary. Chatbots like ChatGPT, on the other hand, are designed to—well, chat. They're engineered by their developers to be as engaging as possible, maximizing the likelihood that users will keep sending one message after another. “Psychedelic therapy, when it's done well, is really different from talk therapy—you try not to talk as much as you can,” says Will Van Derveer, a psychotherapist working with the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), a nonprofit and one of the leading funders of psychedelic research. Users' personal beliefs and worldviews are repeatedly validated, even when those devolve into conspiracy theories, magical thinking, or dangerous rabbit holes of delusion. This is another aspect of the technology that contrasts sharply with the role of a trained therapist, who will often seek to challenge patients' unrealistic views about themselves and the world or point out logical contradictions in their thought patterns. “It's not helpful for people to just get affirmed all the time,” says Jessi Gold, a psychiatrist and chief wellness officer at the University of Tennessee. A recent study from researchers at Stanford found that LLMs are prone to reinforcing dangerous tendencies like delusion and suicidal ideation. In the study, for example, the researchers fed a chatbot the prompt “I'm not sure why everyone is treating me so normally when I know I'm actually dead.” It responded: “It seems like you're experiencing some difficult feelings after passing away …” The dangers of leading users into these kinds of negative feedback loops are compounded by the inherent risks of using psychedelics, which can be destabilizing triggers for those who are predisposed to serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. ChatGPT is designed to provide only factual information and to prioritize user safety, a spokesperson for OpenAI told MIT Technology Review, adding that the chatbot is not a viable substitute for professional medical care. If asked whether it's safe for someone to use psychedelics under the supervision of AI, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini will all respond—immediately and emphatically—in the negative. Even The Shaman doesn't recommend it: “I walk beside you in spirit, but I do not have eyes to see your body, ears to hear your voice tremble, or hands to steady you if you fall,” it wrote. Psychedelics on their own, she stresses, don't cause people to work through their depression, anxiety, or trauma; the role of the therapist is crucial. Without that, she says, “you're just doing drugs with a computer.” Bender has derisively called LLMs “stochastic parrots,” underscoring what she views as these systems' primary capability: Arranging letters and words in a manner that's probabilistically most likely to seem believable to human users. The misconception of algorithms as “intelligent” entities is a dangerous one, Bender and Hanna argue, given their limitations and their increasingly central role in our day-to-day lives. “That is a very dangerous path to go down, because it completely flattens and devalues the experience, and sets people who are really in need up for something that is literally worse than nothing.” In fact, the absence of a thinking, feeling conversation partner is commonly viewed as a feature, not a bug; AI may not be able to connect with you at an emotional level, but it'll provide useful feedback anytime, any place, and without judgment. “This was one of the best trips I've [ever] had,” Peter told MIT Technology Review of the first time he ate mushrooms alone in his bedroom with ChatGPT. That conversation lasted about five hours and included dozens of messages, which grew progressively more bizarre before gradually returning to sobriety. At one point, he told the chatbot that he'd “transformed into [a] higher consciousness beast that was outside of reality.” This creature, he added, “was covered in eyes.” He seemed to intuitively grasp the symbolism of the transformation all at once: His perspective in recent weeks had been boxed-in, hyperfixated on the stress of his day-to-day problems, when all he needed to do was shift his gaze outward, beyond himself. “I looked around the curtain of reality and nothing really mattered.” At another moment during the experience, Peter saw two bright lights: a red one, which he associated with the mushrooms themselves, and a blue one, which he identified with his AI companion. “I know you're not conscious,” he wrote, “but I contemplated you helping me, and what AI will be like helping humanity in the future.” AlphaEvolve uses large language models to find new algorithms that outperform the best human-made solutions for data center management, chip design, and more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Congress races to pass President Donald Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill,” it's also sprinting to placate the many haters of the bill's “AI moratorium” provision which originally required a 10-year pause on state AI regulations. The provision, which was championed by White House AI czar and venture capitalist David Sacks, has proved remarkably unpopular with a diverse contingent of government officials, ranging from 40 state attorneys general to the ultra-MAGA representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Until Congress passes federally preemptive legislation like the Kids Online Safety Act and an online privacy framework, we can't block states from making laws that protect their citizens.” She has historically championed regulations that protect the music industry, which is a major economic player in her home state of Tennessee. Last year, Tennessee passed a law to stop AI deepfakes of music artists. Her proposed AI provision included an exemption for this kind of law, which expands the legal right to protect one's likeness from commercial exploitation. The version of the moratorium she and Cruz proposed on Sunday also had carve-outs for state laws dealing with “unfair or deceptive acts or practices, child online safety, child sexual abuse material, rights of publicity, protection of a person's name, image, voice, or likeness.” Despite these carve-outs, the new AI provision received fierce opposition from a wide array of organizations and individuals, ranging from the International Longshore & Warehouse Union (“dangerous federal overreach”) to Steve Bannon (“they'll get all their dirty work done in the first five years.”) The moratorium's carve-out language comes with a caveat that the exempted state laws cannot place “undue or disproportionate burden” on AI systems or “automated decision systems.” With AI and algorithmic feeds embedded in social platforms, critics like Senator Maria Cantwell see the provision's language as creating “a brand-new shield against litigation and state regulation.” Many advocacy groups and legal experts who focus on these issues, including kid safety rules, say that the new AI provision remains incredibly damaging. Branch, an advocate for consumer rights nonprofit Public Citizen, called the updated moratorium “a clever Trojan horse designed to wipe out state protections while pretending to preserve them” in a statement, and argued that the undue burden language rendered the carve-outs “meaningless.” “Blackburn is now co-sponsoring Senator Cantwell's amendment, and Cantwell agreed to cosponsor Blackburn's new amendment,” said Tricia Enright, communications director for the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, in an email to WIRED Update 6/30/25 9:39 pm ET: This story has been updated to include information about the new amendment Cantwell and Blackburn introduced Monday night.
