LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — A tractor-trailer that was knocked dangling off a bridge over the Ohio River — prompting a dramatic rescue of the driver — was struck by a vehicle that had crossed into opposing traffic, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said Saturday.

Breathtaking photos and video captured the rescue Friday of the driver in her cab over the side of the George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge connecting Louisville, Kentucky, to southern Indiana.

The truck driver was rescued unharmed, but three other cars were involved in the crash, and two people were taken to the hospital with possibly life-threatening injuries, Louisville Metro Police said Friday. 

At a press conference Saturday, Greenberg said one person remains hospitalized with serious injuries. 

Greenberg said the crash occurred when a southbound vehicle hit a stalled car and crossed into northbound traffic, where it struck the tractor-trailer and caused it to go through the guardrail and hang precariously off the edge of the bridge.

The accident was reported shortly after noon on Friday. After that, it took about 40 minutes to set up a rope system and get a firefighter, Bryce Carden, ready to rappel down to the cab, hook the driver up to a safety harness and lift her safely back to the bridge surface, Louisville Fire Chief Brian O’Neill said at a press conference Friday. She was taken to the hospital as a precaution.

Greenberg said Saturday that he spoke to the rescued driver, who has not been identified. 

“She is incredibly brave. She is incredibly fortunate,” he said. 

Greenberg thanked Carden and the first responders, as well as the transportation crews, for their response.

Kentucky's state highway engineer, James Ballinger, said Saturday that while the bridge will need repairs from the crash, particularly to a pedestrian sidewalk, its structural integrity was not compromised. Officials expected to open the bridge Saturday evening. 

The bridge carries about 24,000 vehicles a day over the Ohio River. 

The truck was removed from the bridge around 8 p.m. Friday.

Oregon is poised to step back from its first-in-the-nation drug decriminalization law

Oregon May Revive Penalties for Drug Possession. What Will the Change Do?

FILE - Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek speaks during a signing ceremony in Washington, Friday, Feb. 23, 2024. A bill recriminalizing the possession of small amounts of drugs was passed by the Oregon Legislature, Friday, March 1, 2024, undoing a key part of the state’s first-in-the-nation drug decriminalization law as governments struggle to respond to the deadliest overdose crisis in U.S. history. The bill now heads to the desk of Kotek, who said in January that she is open to signing a bill that would roll back decriminalization, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported.

Oregon is poised to step back from its first-in-the-nation drug decriminalization law with a new measure approved by the state Senate that would reinstate criminal penalties for possessing small amounts of some drugs. 

The law, which took effect in 2021, decriminalized possession and personal use of all drugs, including small amounts of heroin, methamphetamine, LSD, oxycodone and others. 

Supporters of revising the statute say it's needed to address the state's overdose crisis, while opponents say it reverts to an approach that hasn't been beneficial and could violate civil rights. 

Here's a look at how it could change the way drug possession is handled by law enforcement and prosecutors in the state:

  WHICH DRUGS WILL BE ILLEGAL TO POSSESS, AND WHICH WILL NOT?
 




If signed by Gov. Tina Kotek, who has indicated she is open to doing so, the measure approved Friday would restore penalties for possessing illicit drugs including cocaine, fentanyl, heroin and methamphetamine. 

Possession of marijuana, which has been legalized for medical and recreational use in the state, would not be affected. 

The measure also would not criminalize the controlled use of psylocibin mushrooms, which voters approved in 2020 for therapeutic use. 



  HOW WILL POSSESSION BE PENALIZED? 
 

The legislation would implement jail sentences of up to six months for possessing small amounts, and police could also confiscate drugs and stop their use in parks and on sidewalks. 

The measure encourages law enforcement agencies and prosecutors to refer someone arrested or cited for possession to treatment programs instead of jail. The measure also allows for people convicted of possession to have their record expunged later. 



  WHY DID LEGISLATORS MOVE TO CHANGE THE LAW NOW?
 




Oregon is experiencing one of the largest spikes in drug overdose deaths, and a 2023 audit report said the state has the second-highest rate of substance use disorder in the nation while also ranking 50th for treatment access. 

That has prompted criticism and pressure by Republicans to change the decriminalization law. A well-funded ballot campaign to further weaken the statute is underway. 

Researchers say it’s too soon to determine whether the decriminalization measure contributed to the increase in overdoses. 



  WHAT ARE CRITICS OF THE CHANGE SAYING?
 

Opponents of recriminalization say it reverts to a failed, decades-old approach of arresting people for possessing and using even small amounts of drugs. 

They worry that it will disproportionally impact people affected by drug addiction and focuses too much on punitive measures rather than treatment. Critics have also said it will further burden public defenders' caseloads. 

“This legislation exacerbates the challenges faced by those grappling with addiction, particularly impacting Black and brown Oregonians and those experiencing homelessness,” Gloria Ochoa-Sandoval, policy director of Unite Oregon, said in a statement released by a coalition of groups opposed to the measure.

HELSINKI (AP) — King Harald of Norway was implanted with a temporary pacemaker Saturday at a hospital in Malaysia’s resort island of Langkawi, where Europe’s oldest monarch was being treated for an infection during a vacation this week, the Norwegian royal house said.

“The pacemaker was implanted due to a low heart rate,” the Royal House of Norway said in a brief statement, adding that the procedure conducted at Hospital Sultanah Maliha was successful.

Following the operation, Harald, 87, would likely be transported back to Norway “within the next couple of days,” the statement said.

“His Majesty is doing well under the circumstances but still requires rest. The procedure will make the return back home safer,” Bjørn Bendz, the king’s personal physician, said as quoted by the royal palace in Oslo.

The royal house said on Tuesday that Harald, Europe’s oldest reigning monarch, was hospitalized after he fell ill during a private vacation in Langkawi. Norwegian media outlets said Harald traveled to the Malaysian resort island to celebrate his 87th birthday.

Two days before his birthday last week, Norwegian news agency NTB reported that the king was undertaking a private trip abroad together with his wife Queen Sonja, without specifying the destination or dates.

A Scandinavian Airlines medical evacuation plane, which took off from Oslo on Thursday, arrived in Langkawi on Friday. Norwegian authorities haven't confirmed yet whether the Boeing 737-700 aircraft, which has previously been used as a flying ambulance, will pick up King Harald. 

The Norwegian government arranges the transport, and the Norwegian Armed Forces are responsible for the practical arrangements for the king's return trip, according to the royal house.

The aging Norwegian monarch has suffered from frail health over the past few years, and has been admitted to a hospital for treatment on numerous occasions. Harald, who has been seen using crutches, had an operation to replace a heart valve in October 2020 after being hospitalized with breathing difficulties.

Harald has repeatedly said he has no plans to abdicate, unlike his second cousin Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, who stepped down earlier this year. The heir to the Norwegian throne, Crown Prince Haakon, has - as a rule - stepped in and taken over his father’s duties while he's been hospitalized.

Harald’s duties as Norway’s head of state are ceremonial and he holds no political power. He ascended to the throne following the death of his father, King Olav, in 1991.

The country’s first native-born king since the 14th century, he married a commoner as a prince and won hearts in his egalitarian country by leading the mourning in 2011 for the victims of mass killer Anders Behring Breivik.

Work continues at the Museum of Nebraska Art in downtown Kearney. The $31.5 million renovation (plus a new $5 million endowment) is pulling together the original structure - the post office built in 1911— and the new sections to the north. Its 23,000-square-foot addition will showcase exhibi…

KEARNEY — You can’t have a conversation about business without Dan Schumacher mentioning his parents, Pat and Linda Schumacher of Ainsworth.

Dan said he inherited his work ethic from his father, a Sandhills rancher.

“When you’re a ranch kid you know how to work hard,” Schumacher said.

Dan’s mother is a key member of Schumacher Fencing’s management team. She runs the Ainsworth branch. The Kearney-based company opened a Columbus branch in 2020.

The fabrication center in the new Schumacher Fencing headquarters accommodates loading of multiple trailers with pre-cut materials ready for installation. The Kearney-based company installs 500 fences per year. The busy season is approaching fast.

Ainsworth is where the company got its start with Dan teaming up with his brother, Steve, to sell and install agricultural fencing in the Ainsworth area. Initially, the brothers saw their fencing enterprise as a part-time job. “My brother and I decided to do it for one summer, but we made such good money we kept going.”

Dan said it was slow in the beginning. He frequently purchased fencing supplies at retail cost until he decided to purchase a semi-trailer of wood posts. The $7,000 he invested in those posts was all that he had, but the load lasted a year and he turned a tidy profit.

Schumacher said the next step was convincing bankers to extend a loan. Finally, he was able to borrow enough to buy a pickup, a skid steer and flatbed trailer. During those years as he waited for a loan Dan said his father generously supported the fencing business. “My dad always came through and loaned me a pickup.”

Customers can get an idea how their new vinyl fence will look if they scan the examples of designs available from Schumacher Fencing.  

Schumacher attended the University of Nebraska at Kearney and met his future wife there. Today, Bergan, an attorney, and Dan are raising two daughters, Kennedi, 2, and Karlee, 6 months.

Schumacher said Kearney has been very good to him. It’s where he got his education, met his wife, and expanded his business. Key to that expansion, he said, was becoming a vendor for Country Estates Fencing manufactured in Cozad by Nebraska Plastics.

“If you can buy whole truckloads you can save money. Cutting down the steps also helps,” he said.

A large showroom greets customers entering the new headquarters of Schumacher Fencing on U.S. Highway 30 in west Kearney.

Schumacher Fencing recently moved from Dan’s rural homeplace at 6905 Cottonmill Ave. to an 18,000-square-foot steel Morton Building that houses a showroom and corporate offices, a materials warehouse and staging and fabrication space.

Schumacher said the design of the building at 3107 West U.S. Highway 30 capitalizes on the principles that have made Schumacher Fencing successful. Fabrication and installation are simplified and standardized so even new crew members learn the system quickly and are efficient and fast.

Dan Schumacher scouted buildings for about two years to decide what the exterior of his new company headquarters should look like.

Dan Schumacher spent everything he had — $7,000 — for a semi-load of wood posts. The gamble paid off. The supply lasted a year, he turned a tidy profit, and he learned the value of buying in quantity..

The relationship with Nebraska Plastics has been key in stabilizing cost, quality and the availability of materials. Schumacher said most customers select from 6-8 favorite styles and colors. The fence on the west side of the property exhibits the basic styles they can select from. Schumacher also can design custom fences.

He said every member of the Schumacher family either works or has worked for the fencing company.

Steve, who co-founded the business, went on to become a veterinarian. Andrew Schumacher manages the Columbus branch. Brothers Joe, Tom and Mike all have worked for the company. Dan’s sister, Carrie, has helped with advertising and tech support.

A computer controlled router cuts holes in vinyl plastic material. The pre-cut parts then are shipped to the installation site. 

The Kearney branch employs seven, Ainsworth has four and Columbus has four.

North-central Nebraska is well-represented in the company, with Ainsworth native Dori Haskell working as Kearney office manager and Jeremy Pacha, an Atkinson native, as branch manager in Kearney. Lucas Johnson of Bayard is the fabrication manager in Kearney.

Schumacher said efficiency and quality are key to his company’s success, so he works with an installation crew almost daily. He can evaluate how well the crew is working and lead by example.

“We average two fences per day, or about 500 fences per year,” Schumacher said about his sales, fabrication and installation systems.

A plaque in the showroom shares a bit of history about Schumacher Fencing.

Schumacher Fencing will have its ribbon cutting at 4 p.m. Thursday. He said Kearney has been a terrific place to grow his business.

“I fell in love with Kearney. It’s been the perfect size,” he said.

Dori Haskell is the office manager at Schumacher Fencing. Like some of the other employees at the Kearney-based business, she's a native of Ainsworth, where the company started.

The Schumacher Fencing warehouse is clean and spacious, making it an ideal place to store fencing materials to keep installation schedules on track.

Taiko, a blockchain project focused on scaling Ethereum  ETH 
      -0.67%
     , has announced a $15 million Series A funding round as it prepares for its mainnet launch.

Lightspeed Faction, Hashed, Generative Ventures and Token Bay Capital co-led the funding round, Taiko said Saturday. Other investors in the round included Wintermute Ventures, Flow Traders, Amber Group, OKX Ventures and GSR.

It is unclear whether the round has fully closed; the announcement mentions ""the close of commitments"" and includes a note that says ""certain investments remain subject to regulatory approval."" Taiko did not respond to The Block's multiple requests for comment.

The Series A announcement comes around nine months after the project disclosed two funding rounds worth $22 million last June. It is unclear when Taiko began raising money for the latest round and whether it used an equity, token or mix structure. Co-founder and chief operating officer Terence Lam declined to comment on the timeline, structure and valuation but said all three rounds have the same structure.

Taiko launched its sixth testnet last month and is preparing to launch its mainnet in the coming months.

Taiko is a Layer 2 scaling startup that aims to make Ethereum cheaper while maintaining its core properties, such as being censorship-resistant, permissionless and secure. It is building a ""Type 1"" ZK-EVM — an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible ZK-rollup that supports zero-knowledge proof computation.

""Type 1 ZK-EVMs strive to be fully and uncompromisingly Ethereum-equivalent. They do not change any part of the Ethereum system to make it easier to generate proofs,"" Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said in 2022. ""Type 1 ZK-EVMs are what we ultimately need to make the Ethereum Layer 1 itself more scalable.""

Under development since 2022, Taiko launched its sixth testnet called Katla in January. The project claims to have seen more than 1.1 million wallet addresses and over 13 million total transactions to date on Katla.

Katla used Taiko's ""based contestable rollup"" design, a multi-proof rollup architecture that features a contestation mechanism and based sequencing, the project said.

""In the future, Taiko will develop the based booster rollup, a design that tackles the liquidity fragmentation issue by allowing developers to deploy on Ethereum and scale natively across all Layer 2s,"" it added.

Taiko had planned to launch its mainnet by the first quarter of this year. When asked if that plan is intact, Lam said: ""We definitely need to upgrade our Katla testnet to enable support for EIP-4844 and perform one more cycle of stress test and security audit for the mainnet.""

""The current outlook for completion of that is before the end of Q2,"" he added.

There are currently around 40 people working for Taiko, and the project looks to grow its team by hiring across functions, including engineering, community and ecosystem growth, Lam said.

Taiko also plans to set up an ecosystem investment fund with its investors, the amount for which is yet to be finalized, Lam added. In December, Taiko announced an allocation of about $30 million for its second round of the grants program.

TRENDING TODAY

In response to an X post from Roko Mijic slamming the adoption of memecoins that sparked a massive rally this weekend, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has waded in with an attempt to set the record straight regarding the nascent asset class adoption.

The ongoing memecoin rally in the digital asset space pushed the combined market cap of the assets up 30% north of $41 billion earlier today. Popular Shiba Inu (SHIB) surged by a wholesome 52% earlier today, leading the memecoin rally. The price surge took the price of SHIB to $0.00002 and till the time of this writing, the token is yet to bow to bearish correction.

Canine-themed memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) equally registered up to 30% increase earlier in the week. Market analysts believe that DOGE may be gearing up for a mega bull run in the long run. Its average daily trading volume has also gone up significantly, surpassing $4.77 billion. Overall, the rally has touched almost all memcoins and there are still speculations that the positive momentum will last for a while.

One X user tried to establish the fact that these memecoins are currently experiencing a rally due to a lack of use cases resulting from a decline in crypto infrastructure. However, Vitalik Buterin reacted to the post, trying to explain that this is not the outlook in all cases. 

“I feel like 2 years ago I completely agreed, and my high-level argument was something like “infrastructure is public goods, the incentive to fund public goods is N times smaller than optimal (that’s basic econ 101), so it’s practically impossible for there to be too much infrastructure”,” Buterin explained.

He went on to talk about how “infrastructure” is a diverse category where some could be public goods and others are “realistically a zero-sum network effect grabbing game.” For Buterin, he perceives some infrastructures as being over-invested, having more than enough acceptance and adoption. On one hand, others are barely loved and talk more about being accepted.

I feel like 2 years ago I completely agreed, and my high-level argument was something like ""infrastructure is public goods, the incentive to fund public goods is N times smaller than optimal (that's basic econ 101), so it's practically impossible for there to be too much…

— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) March 2, 2024



For perspective, the Ethereum co-founder itemized some of the infrastructure that he perceives as under-loved. Zk voting as well as association set providers for privacy pools made it to the list amongst many others. 

Vitalik Buterin mentioned ENS names on Layer-2 with decentralized verification via CCIP as one of the under-loved infrastructures. The others were proof of personhood and proof of community membership, more secure software supply chains for DApps, and a fully decentralized (and no “governance token”) instant cross-L2 token transfer protocol.

All these have gained expression one or or another with Polygon deploying the ZK technology through its ZKEVM protocol. However, the adoption is generally at a lower pace compared to the hype memecoins are generating at the moment.

Kevin Garnett stepped away from the NBA after the 2015-16 season. His career spanned more than two decades, and during that time, Garnett had numerous head-to-head battles on the basketball court against LeBron James. 

James is in the midst of his 21st season in the NBA and is still playing at a high level. James enters Saturday night's game against the defending champion Denver Nuggets just nine points shy of 40,000 career points.

James' oldest son, Bronny, has been a topic of conversation in recent days. As the college basketball regular season comes to a close, there have been more and more questions about whether USC freshman Bronny will declare for the 2024 NBA Draft, but the elder James recently took issue with a mock draft that excluded Bronny.

""Can yall please just let the kid be a kid and enjoy college basketball,"" the Los Angeles Lakers superstar wrote on X, the company formerly known as Twitter. ""The work and results will ultimately do the talking no matter what he decides to do. If y’all don’t know he doesn’t care what a mock draft says, he just WORKS! Earned Not Given!""

At one point during a recent episode of the ""KG CERTIFIED w/ Kevin Garnett"" podcast, Garnett began discussing how Bronny would project as an NBA player. 

LEBRON JAMES BLASTS COVERAGE AROUND BRONNY DESPITE SAYING HE COULD PLAY FOR LAKERS 'EASY'

""Bronny can get a bucket on Bron,"" NBA champion Paul Pierce asserted.

Garnett quickly pushed back saying, ""No, no, no he can’t.""

""Man, c’mon, that little dude is explosive,"" Pierce responded.

But Garnett's argument about James being able to prevent Bronny from scoring during a hypothetical game did not center around age, size, or experience. Instead, Garnett suggested that James used steroids.

""His dad on that BALCO, he on that new juice,"" Garnett said.

Garnett did not offer any additional context or information to support the claim he made on the podcast.

Fox News Digital contacted James' representatives. Emails seeking comment did not immediately receive a response.

James, notably, has never failed a drug test during his lengthy professional basketball career. He had previously been embroiled in a PED-related controversy when documents surfaced linking some of James' associates to the Biogenesis scandal.

The 2013 federal Biogenesis probe, which the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents unofficially referred to as ""Operation Strikeout,"" resulted in the conviction of Anthony Bosch, a self-described biochemist, and several associates.

The DEA ultimately cleared James following the probe. James was also cleared following ESPN's 2023 report on the Biogenesis investigation.

Wednesday’s Section VI Class C semifinal was widely considered to be the de facto championship game.

Frewsburg confirmed that Saturday afternoon.

The third-seeded Bears — who beat No. 2 Randolph less than 72 hours earlier — raced out to a 21-6 first-quarter lead and breezed to a 71-36 victory over No. 4 Ellicottville in the championship game at Jamestown Community College’s Physical Education Complex.

Junior Teghan Trocki paced Frewsburg with 21 points, all on 3-pointers, while her freshman sister, Jadyn, finished with 20 points, eight assists and three steals as the Bears won the sixth title in program history.

“We talked in the locker room that we had to come out here and take care of business,” Frewsburg head coach Sierra Beaver said. “They wanted to win too. It wasn’t just going to be handed to us.”

Next up for Frewsburg is a Far West Regional date at 4 p.m. next Saturday at Finger Lakes Community College against Section V’s champion. Class C1 Bloomfield and Class C2 Dundee/Bradford will play for the Rochester area’s championship Tuesday.

“Neither of them have been there the last six or seven years,” Beaver said of the Bears’ possible opponents. “I have some girls who played in that game a couple of years ago when we went. Hopefully our experience will help us out there.”

The Bears left little doubt Saturday that they would be the Buffalo area’s representative at regionals.

Jadyn Trocki opened the game with a 3-pointer and Teghan Trocki added a pair of her own before the first quarter was over as Frewsburg led by 15 after eight minutes.

“We talked about how important it was for her to get going,” Beaver said of Teghan Trocki. “I feel like our last four games or so our offense was pretty stagnant. We said if we had open looks, we had to use this game as a game to get our momentum going and our offense flowing a little bit better before the next game.”

The second quarter was even better. Teghan Trocki hit four more 3-pointers and Jadyn began getting to the basket as the Bears pushed the ball up the floor before the Eagles were able to set their defense.

“Today, I think was the strongest I’ve ever seen her take the ball to the hole, not shying away at the end from that pressure,” Beaver added of Jadyn Trocki. “She got to the line a few times and that helped her get into rhythm. I think she was feeling a little bit more confident from the start.”

The Trockis combined for 33 points in the first half, which allowed Beaver to freely go to her bench throughout the second half.

“I was feeling it in the first half, definitely. If I got a look, I knew I was going to take it,” Teghan Trocki said, adding of her sister: “Last game was her first truly big game here at JCC. I was proud of her last game for attacking the way she did. She knew she could do it against (Randolph), so she had the confidence to do it against Ellicottville today.”

Junior Kaylee Cappa (6 points, two rebounds) and sophomore Abery Harvey (4 points, three rebounds) contributed valuable minutes with senior forward Paige Whippo in foul trouble.

“Kaylee and Abery did a great job. We talked to them both about how important they are whether they get two minutes or 15 minutes,” Beaver said. ” … It’s really nice to have that option if Paige is in foul trouble or something like that.”

Eighth-grader Jaden Jimerson and junior Raven Troutman found their way onto the scoresheet down the stretch.

“Last game was intense,” Teghan Trocki said. “We were all tired from that, so we knew we had to come out with intensity in order for it to carry on throughout the game.”

Frewsburg will now take the week to prepare for next Saturday’s Far West Regional in hopes of advancing to the first New York State Public High School Athletic Association final four in school history. The Bears have lost their previous four quarterfinal appearances.

“We lost two years ago at Far West,” Teghan Trocki said. “We’re hoping to redeem ourselves.”

NOTES: Junior Ava Jimerson had 9 points, 10 rebounds, three assists and three steals; junior Taytum Jimerson had five rebounds, five steals and five assists; and senior Gracie Conlan had eight rebounds for Frewsburg, which shot 26 of 57 from the field, including 9 of 26 from 3-point range, and turned the ball over 11 times. … Junior Natalee Leiper had 13 points, and senior Dalayla Alexander had seven rebounds and four assists for Ellicottville, which shot 13 of 45 from the field, including 2 of 12 from 3-point range, and turned the ball over 19 times.

An incarceration history is associated with worse access to and receipt of health care, according to a study published online Feb. 23 in JAMA Health Forum.

Jingxuan Zhao, M.P.H., from the American Cancer Society in Atlanta, and colleagues examined whether incarceration history is associated with access to and receipt of health care in the United States. The analysis included 7,963 individuals (586 with incarceration history) participating in the 2008 to 2018 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort.

The researchers found that compared with people without incarceration history, people with incarceration history had lower percentages of having a usual source of care or receiving preventive services, including physical examinations (69.6 versus 74.1 percent), blood pressure tests (85.6 versus 91.6 percent), blood cholesterol level tests (59.5 versus 72.2 percent), blood glucose level tests (61.4 versus 69.4 percent), dental check-ups (51.1 versus 66.0 percent), and breast (55.0 versus 68.2 percent) and colorectal cancer screening (65.6 versus 70.3 percent).

When further adjusting for educational attainment and health insurance, the associations of incarceration history and access to care were attenuated for most measures but remained statistically significant for measures of having a usual source of care, blood cholesterol level test, and dental check-up only.

""Efforts to improve access to education and health insurance coverage for people with an incarceration history might mitigate disparities in care,"" the authors write.

Defending champion Alex de Minaur has advanced to the final of the Mexican Open after Jack Draper retired in the third set of their last-four clash.

The third-seeded Australian won the first set 6-3, dropped the second 6-2 and was leading 4-0 in the third when Draper, who was visibly diminished physically, called it quits.

De Minaur will face Casper Ruud in the final after the Norwegian defeated Holger Rune of Denmark in three sets 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.

“I’m happy to be in the final, but I’m hoping that Jack is doing fine,” de Minaur said.

“He has a tremendous talent and hopefully he can recover for the upcoming tournaments.

“It’s hard to play when your opponent is not OK physically, but you need to remain focused.”

Draper was playing in his first semi-final of an ATP 500 tournament but was forced to leave the court in the final set because of an undisclosed illness.

The 22-year-old’s illness became an issue towards the end of the second set, with Draper receiving treatment from the physiotherapist and tournament doctor.

Members of several New York-area rugby teams share a glimpse of the sport and comment on its growth in America.

Aussies are bringing rugby to the states. No pads? No helmets? No problem.

The National Rugby League (NRL) will kick off its season, Saturday, for the first time on American soil, live on FS1 and the FOX Sports app. 

The wildly popular NRL bills itself as one of the most-watched programs on Australian television, attracting more than 100 million viewers each year. A large American audience will now have a chance to witness the fast-paced sport when Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas hosts the historic season-opening double header. 

Ahead of the double header, ""FOX & Friends Weekend"" spoke to members of four New York-area rugby clubs about the sport, so they could give Americans unfamiliar with it a taste of what to expect.

NATIONAL RUGBY LEAGUE BREAKS GROUND IN US WITH OPENING WEEKEND IN LAS VEGAS: HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

Co-host Pete Hegseth asked the men – a mix of team captains and coaches from the New York, Suffolk, Rockaway, and Long Island rugby clubs – what new audiences should look for if they're tuning into the sport for the first time on FS1. ""It looks like sports we're familiar with, but not exactly the same,"" the co-host commented. 

""I wanna say, you're going to be looking for nonstop action, hard hits and a good time,"" team captain Wesley Bybel said. 

Co-host Will Cain then asked the Long Island club coach, ""Max, what attracts guys in America, in Long Island, New York to rugby?"" Max Witowski noted that his love of football eventually led him to it. ""Well, I started playing in college – wanted to be a football player – didn't quite make the team. And some guy said, ‘Come try rugby.’ I said I'd never really known the sport before that."" He said that soon after, he went to the rugby field, started playing, and has been playing for the 15 years since.

Dan Bamford, an Englishman who coaches one of the New York clubs, told the co-hosts where the sport is most popular. He said, ""It's played all across Europe, mainly in South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, England, Ireland, Wales, Scotland.""

""So we're taught from a very young age, from like six, seven, or eight, and then we carry on all the way through, to adulthood,"" Bamford added. 

The Englishman was then asked to explain a drill that was being conducted by several rugby players just off camera. He said, ""What's happening is, in Rugby basically, you have to obviously pass the ball backwards. So they're just doing a little three-on-two drill at the moment, cause you play both sides of the ball. You play offense and defense."" 

He continued, ""So what they're doing at the moment, you have three attackers taking on two defenders, trying to move the ball past them in a traditional sense.""

The men answered a few of Hegseth and Cain's more specific rugby-related questions, like about what happens in the ""scrum"" and where the bigger guys on the team usually play.

Bamford explained that teams want their faster guys, the guys ""with the wheels,"" on the edge of the field, so they can take the ball ""all the way into the try zone"" – the rugby equivalent of the end zone. 

Hegseth marveled at the fact that these players do not use helmets or pads while playing. Witowski remarked, ""It is really a game for all shapes and sizes, whether you're big, small or in-between, you can come down and play and have a good time."" Wesley followed up, declaring, ""You gotta have the heart.""

""That's what football should look like,"" Cain added. 

The co-host also noted that there are a lot of injuries associated with the sport. However, he said there are fewer concussions than in American football. 

One of the captains, Ciaran O’Hara, explained this, saying, ""You tend to develop better technique playing rugby than in football, because you don't feel indestructible the way you do when you're wearing a football helmet, and pads and everything.""

The Manly Warringah Sea Eagles face off with the South Sydney Rabbitohs at 9:30 p.m. ET, followed by Sydney Roosters against the Brisbane Broncos at 11:30 p.m. ET. For a breakdown of the rules, the NRL released a promotional video on X earlier this month narrated by Australian actor Russell Crowe.

""Arguably the fastest, most aggressive ball-in-hand football game that exists,"" Crowe, co-owner of South Sydney, explained. 

As explained by the ""Gladiator"" actor, each team has 13 players on the field with just four on the bench playing in an 80-minute game with two halves. The game is played on a 100-meter field (approximately 110 yards) with an oval-shaped ball. 

Unlike American football, rugby features no pads or helmets, no timeouts, no forward passing, and every player can tackle, pass and kick the ball when necessary. Instead of four downs, teams have six tackles to attempt to move the ball forward, and there are more scoring opportunities, which range from one point to four. 

Fans can tune in live on FS1 and the FOX Sports app.

Tom Shillue and ‘Gutfeld!’ guests discuss President Biden's and former President Trump’s opposing border visits.

The U.S. delivered its first air drop of aid supplies to Gaza on Saturday, with President Biden's administration saying it would be a ""sustained effort"" to bring more food and other aid.

The first of the airdrops landed in Gaza on Saturday, delivering some 38,000 MREs, or meals ready-to-eat. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby says drops will continue throughout the coming weeks in partnership with Jordan and other allies.

""We need to do more and the United States will do more,"" Biden told reporters on Friday. ""Aid flowing to Gaza is nowhere nearly enough.""

The U.S. is also considering the delivery of aid by U.S. navy vessels in the Mediterranean Sea along the coast of Gaza.

The U.S. delivered the aid in a joint operation with the Royal Jordanian Air Force, according to a statement from CENTCOM.

Saturday's drop comes after more than 100 people were reported dead and hundreds more wounded when Palestinians rushing toward trucks loaded with humanitarian aid encountered fire in Gaza City early Thursday, according to local media reports.

The exact circumstances surrounding the deaths remain unclear; while several reports suggested Israeli troops fired on the crowd as they descended upon the trucks, the Israeli military suggested that most who died were trampled.

Ashraf al-Qidra, a spokesman for the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, said at least 104 people were killed and around 760 were wounded, describing the incident as a ""massacre.""

Israel has contested that description, however, saying the vast majority of those killed in the incident were trampled in the rush toward aid.

""Early this morning, during the entry of humanitarian aid trucks into the northern Gaza Strip, Gazan residents surrounded the trucks, and looted the supplies being delivered,"" Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. ""During the incident, dozens of Gazans were injured as a result of pushing and trampling. The incident is under review.""

The IDF suggested that fewer than 10 civilians were injured by Israeli forces opening fire during the delivery of humanitarian aid.

Hamas says it holds Israel and Biden's administration ""fully responsible"" for the incident and for the ""ethnic cleansing"" of its people. The group called for worldwide demonstrations against Israel's bombardment of Gaza. 

""We have mercy on the souls of our people’s martyrs, and we affirm that their sacrifices and blood will not be in vain and that we will remain loyal to our cause, our land, and our sanctities,"" the group posted to Telegram.
