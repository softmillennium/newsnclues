Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea is doubling trading fees from 0.5% to 1% just weeks before the debut of its native SEA token. 

The increase, only briefly mentioned, came alongside other updates from OpenSea CMO Adam Hollander in a long X post on Monday, Sept. 8, including a new mobile app, a multimillion-dollar NFT collection, and the final rewards campaign.

According to Hollander, starting Sept. 15, half of all fees — now set at 1% for trading NFTs and 0.85% for token swaps — will be funneled into OpenSea's pre-token launch rewards pool, which already includes $1 million in Optimism's OP and Arbitrum's ARB tokens, with additional NFTs and tokens set to be distributed through a gamified system of “treasure chests.”

A spokesperson for OpenSea confirmed to The Defiant that OpenSea's fees “will be updated as part of powering the final pre-TGE rewards phase,” adding, however, that they “don't have information to share on whether the NFT fee will revert or be adjusted after the rewards program concludes.”

By raising fees, OpenSea may be shooting itself in the foot, especially with its key rival Blur charging no trading fees and competitors Magic Eden and LooksRare holding steady at 0.5%.

The fee change coincides with a broader product push. OpenSea unveiled a mobile app it calls “AI-native,” designed to unify portfolios across chains and offer real-time trading recommendations. The company also rolled out a Flagship Collection, committing over $1 million to acquire historic NFTs such as CryptoPunks.

An update on the long-awaited SEA token is expected in early October, with the foundation behind the project promising “thoughtful mechanics, clear reasons to hold, and long-term sustainability baked in from the start.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum is entering one of its most powerful phases yet, combining deep institutional interest with unprecedented levels of on-chain activity, according to the latest data from CryptoQuant. Data points across spot ETFs, whale accumulation, staking, and smart contract usage indicate ETH's growing role as both a financial asset and the dominant programmable settlement layer. While fundamentals remain strong, market dynamics suggest that resistance levels could temper near-term gains. This shift demonstrates the deepening involvement of asset managers and sophisticated investors. However, the fact that so much “smart money” is already positioned could limit near-term upside unless fresh inflows sustain momentum. Staking reduces circulating supply, creating natural bullish pressure as less ETH is available on the open market. Overall, staking growth shows strong conviction among ETH holders but introduces a delicate balance between supply reduction and market flexibility. This wave of network usage provides fundamental support to ETH's valuation and strengthens the case for long-term adoption. Exchange inflows have slowed sharply since Ethereum peaked near $5,000, reducing selling pressure and supporting stability. However, ETH's rally stalled near the $5,200 realized price upper band, a historically strong resistance level. With ETH currently trading around $4,400, the market may be primed for sideways action or a modest correction unless it can decisively break through this resistance. Analysts at Derive, a crypto options exchange, anticipate that Ethereum could climb to $6,000, driven by three major bullish factors, creating what could be the strongest crypto bull run in recent years. Whether this cycle delivers further price discovery depends on its ability to convert strong fundamentals into a sustained push beyond key resistance levels.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Markets are ignoring a hotter-than-expected inflation report and instead turning their attention to the latest signs that the U.S. labor market is faltering — a shift in focus that points to growing concern about a deeper economic slowdown. Consumer prices rose a bit more than expected August, according to CPI data released Thursday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Normally, that would suggest the U.S. central bank should hold off on interest rate cuts. That data showed claims soaring to 263,000 last week — the highest in nearly four years and up from 236,000 the previous week and 235,000 forecast. Bitcoin BTC$114,431.30 and ether (ETH) are only modestly higher, but the bigger action is in altcoins, suggesting the sort of animal spirits one might associated with monetary policy about to get a lot easier. Solana SOL$226.61 has risen 11% week-over-week to its highest level since January and dogecoin DOGE$0.2525 17% on a weekly basis. As for the real economy, today's numbers offer a troubling glimpse into something the U.S. central bank has been working hard to avoid: stagflation. Cutting interest rates to stimulate growth risks inflaming inflation. But failure to ease monetary policy while the employment situation deteriorates isn't a much better alternative. For now, traders are betting that the Fed will lean toward protecting growth over stamping out inflation, with odds pointing to a rate cut next week as a near certainty. “It's going to be a rough few months ahead as the tariffs impacts work their way through the economy," said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's money to be made buying up all kind of crypto these days. Eightco Holding (ORBS), Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), and Sharplink Gaming (SBET) have all announced plans to become crypto treasuries—companies that buy up coins for their balance sheets—and seen their stocks surge in response. Their shares have outpaced bitcoin and stocks linked to it, in some cases climbing 500% or more year-to-date. A revival in bitcoin alternatives, or altcoins, which fall in and out of favor over crypto cycles, could make these companies not just trendy climbers but also stock proxies for the assets they hold, further legitimizing those coins. They are part of a new wave of crypto assets—from high-profile IPOs, ETFs holding memes like dogecoin, and freshly unlocked tokens— that are flying towards the markets and at times flying upward once they hit them. Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), which got the news last week that it wouldn't be included in the S&P 500 index, is the best-known example of a company turned crypto treasury. A handful of companies now want to do the same thing for assets ranging from number-two cryptocurrency ether (ETHUSD) to worldcoin (WLDUSD) and Trump family-linked coins like World Liberty Financial's token (WLFIUSD). Traders are 'buying these vehicles as plays on the price and attention momentum or a way to get exposure to crypto that doesn't have an ETF yet," Tom Bruni, head of markets and investor insights at StockTwits, told Investopedia recently. What's next for altcoin treasury stocks remains an open question, though at least one crypto market indicator has been flashing in favor of altcoins, which could help their stock treasuries. Bitcoin dominance, which measures bitcoin's market cap as a percentage of the entire crypto universe, has fallen from 65% in late June to around 56% recently, according to CoinGecko. Ether gained to around 13% from around 9% in that time, while other non-stablecoins have as a group climbed to 24% from 19%. Eightco stock recently got supercharged after the company said that it was raising funds to become a treasury for worldcoin, the token tied to the Sam Altman venture aimed at creating biometrics-based digital identities. It also said Wall Street tech analyst Dan Ives would be its new chairman. Bitcoin miner Bitmine and sports betting company SharpLink Gaming are lining up behind ether. The former, which tapped Fundstrat chief Tom Lee as chairman, aims to build a "tower of ether" and acquire 5% of the total supply. Though ether supply isn't fixed, it's at roughly 121 million recently, according to etherscan. "Ether total supply and market capitalization chart."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin price action gets lively as US CPI data conforms to expectations, but traders are anything but unified on short-term price targets. Bitcoin nears three-week highs as US CPI data matches expectations. Plenty of market participants see Bitcoin heading higher as aresult, perhaps after a dip to trap late longs. CPI has seen BTC price fakeouts in recent months. Bitcoin (BTC) saw telltale volatility at Thursday's Wall Street open as US macro data furthered interest-rate cut odds. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD spiking to $114,731. While CPI was at its highest since January, the headline figure was instead initial jobless claims, which saw their largest numbers since October 2021 at 263,000 versus 235,000 expected. “Markets are now pricing-in 75 basis points of rate cuts by year-end,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter noted in a follow-up thread on X. BTC price forecasts also stressed the importance of recent support reclaims. Related: Bitcoin price can hit $160K in October as MACD golden cross returns For fellow trader BitBull, flipping $113,500 from resistance to support was the key low-time frame event, which opened the door to a rematch with all-time highs. $BTC has reclaimed a very crucial level.The $113.5K level which acted as a resistance has now been flipped into support.Now the next key level for Bitcoin is to reclaim $117K level, and a new ATH will be confirmed. “One more liquidation before higher,” part of an X post suggested, noting 2,000 BTC of liquidity appearing on exchange order books. Crypto investor and entrepreneur Ted Pillows went further, suggesting that BTC/USD would copy previous CPI behavior to first rise then plumb fresh lows.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.K.'s Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) warned on Thursday that student hackers motivated by dares are driving an increasing number of cyberattacks and data breaches affecting schools. It advised parents to “to have regular conversations with their children about what they get up to online” and warned that children hacking into their school's computer systems may be setting themselves up for lives of cybercrime. The privacy regulator said it identified “a worrying pattern” in the 215 insider threat breach reports from the education sector between January 2022 and August 2024, with 57% of incidents caused by students who were likely motivated by “dares, notoriety, financial gain, revenge and rivalries.” “Teen hackers are commonly English speaking males and around 5% of 14-year-old boys and girls admit to hacking,” the privacy watchdog stated. Diverting children with an interest in technology away from criminality and into legal programs is a key aim of the NCA, which believes that one-in-five children in Britain aged 10 to 16 has engaged in illegal activity online. Some of the 215 breaches in the education sector were caused by what the ICO described as poor data protection practices, including staff accessing data without a legitimate need, by devices being left unattended or by students being allowed to use staff devices. Just 5% of incidents involved insiders “using sophisticated techniques to bypass security and network controls” stated the regulator. “When questioned, the students admitted being interested in IT and cyber security, and that they wanted to test their skills and knowledge,” the regulator added, noting that two admitted they “belong to an online hackers forum.” is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. If there's one constant in crypto, it's volatility. Since Bitcoin first emerged in 2009, there have been euphoric upswings and catastrophic declines. When Fortune's Jeff John Roberts asked the crypto executive whether that was the case during a panel at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference in Park City, Utah, Sethi responded yes—with some nuance. If I look at the overall slope over 15 years, I would say no,” said the Kraken executive. “If you look at it quarter by quarter, the answer is yes, we get into those bubbles all the time.” That even a crypto CEO would say that his industry is headed for a potential crash speaks to the frothiness in the crypto markets over the past year. While some of that enthusiasm stems from Bitcoin's correlation with the stock market—the S&P 500 has also set new records since President Donald Trump's inauguration in January—pro-crypto regulatory changes in the U.S. are also a likely factor for crypto's recent surge. But all bubbles eventually pop, and there are already signs of a potential burst, including declining enthusiasm in crypto's newest trend: digital asset treasuries, or public companies that amass crypto on their balance sheets to boost their share prices. Proponents say these companies let investors gain exposure to cryptocurrencies not readily accessible within their brokerage accounts, but detractors say these firms are a quick cash grab and will eventually collapse. There may already be signs of that collapse. Last week, the average drop in stock price of 15 digital asset treasuries tracked by Architect Partners, a crypto M&A advisory and financing firm, was 15%. Still, on the same panel with Kraken co-CEO Sethi, billionaire Barry Silbert, founder of the crypto company Digital Currency Group, was optimistic. “There's a whole lot of crap in crypto right now, which is overvalued. I think 99% of crypto is absolutely going to zero,” he said. And if Bitcoin's history of big drops and even bigger rebounds is any indication, Silbert may be right.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Altcoins drove the gains this week while Bitcoin steadied. Bitcoin slipped −0.1%, Ethereum added +0.6%, while Solana (−0.5%) and Dogecoin (−0.4%) paused after big weekly runs. Bitcoin Cash (+1.6%) and TRON (+0.6%) managed to hold firmer. On the hourly view, buying interest returned: Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin, and LINK all ticked higher. That's a signal some traders are leaning back in after the 24-hour slowdown. The Momentum Alignment Score tracks whether a coin is up or down across three timeframes — 7-day, 24-hour, and 1-hour. Ethereum (MAS +3): Up across all timeframes, the cleanest leader among majors. Solana & Dogecoin (MAS +1): Strong week, a pause in the last day, then fresh hourly gains. Ethereum stands out as the most balanced mover right now. Open interest for Sept 19 expiry: 55% puts vs 45% calls. Takeaway: Institutions expect Bitcoin to stay range-bound between $27 and $35 into expiry, hedging downside risk while capping near-term upside. Key levels: Strong call positioning near $30, put protection around $42 and $50. Takeaway: A slightly bullish setup, with traders building exposure but keeping protection in place. Altcoins dominated the weekly leaderboard, but today looked more like consolidation than reversal. Ethereum remains the standout, supported by both momentum alignment and option positioning. Bitcoin's cautious stance via MAXI options suggests a tighter trading band in the near term, while Ethereum's option flow points to gradual accumulation. Today's pulse: crypto is catching its breath after a strong run, but with Ethereum leading and Solana/Dogecoin regaining hourly strength, the door stays open for further upside. Can Ethereum extend its three-timeframe strength into the weekend? Does Bitcoin respect the $27–35 MAXI range ahead of September expiry? Do altcoins like Solana and Dogecoin keep their hourly momentum, or fade back into consolidation? For deeper daily insights across crypto, stocks, and futures, visit investingLive.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Experts suggest growing anticipation ahead of key macroeconomic events this week has led to a stark divergence between futures traders betting on Ethereum and exchange-traded funds rotating their capital to Bitcoin. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have notched a net inflow of $1.39 billion over the past ten days, according to data from SoSoValue. Over the same period, spot Ethereum ETFs have seen outflows of $668 million, highlighting a rotational trade by institutional investors. “I think we'll close Q3 on an uptrend led by altcoins," he added. Gregory's outlook is echoed by Coinanalyze data, which shows altcoins' share of total trading volume has jumped to 50% this week after consolidating around 40% for weeks. As a result, the rotational trade has fueled a significant performance gap with Ethereum up 31% year-to-date, outpacing Bitcoin's 19% gain, CoinGecko data shows. While the futures traders show a growing interest in Ethereum and altcoins, the options market data reveals a more tempered outlook. Implied volatility, which tracks the market's future expectations based on options data, continues to remain low, Adam Chu, Chief researcher at GreeksLive, an options trading platform, told Decypt. Despite the rate decision next week, he said, “the options market is pricing in relatively low future volatility, with a consensus that a 25-basis-point rate cut has already been factored in.” The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>COLLEGE STATION, Texas (KBTX) -With a city council vote approaching on Thursday, Priority Power CEO Brandon Schwertner is clearing the air about what he calls misconceptions about a proposed data facility that's being opposed by many residents in College Station. He says the misconception originated from early documents that were drafted and eventually shared on social media that referenced Bitcoin mining, despite developers now stating that the project is focused on data and AI. “I think there was a general misconception, and rightfully so, that this was going to be a Bitcoin mining site,” Schwertner said. “We'll be asking the city council to strike that.” Schwertner, a third-generation Aggie and former Texas A&M football player, said the data center, which is planned to be located near the Midtown area behind Costco, would focus on artificial intelligence and high-performance computing, and added that it could support the university, create jobs, and generate tax revenue. “It's going to bring more business into the city,” he said. In Granbury, residents who live near a Bitcoin mine say constant sound has disrupted their daily lives. “It's 10 o'clock at night, and I'm sitting next to my truck,” one resident said. “I'm actually touching my truck, and you're hearing all the Bitcoin noise. The sound here at night is so horrendous, it broadcasts through my walls, my windows.” Schwertner said College Station residents would not face those conditions. So if this is going to be located in a city, there's not going to be noise issues — the city wouldn't allow for it.” He said the project's power would be sourced to avoid impacts on residents' bills. So if you think about the city and the residents in a silo, the high-performance computing center is not going to come in and take power out of the pool and then drive prices up as a result,” he said. So it's not going to affect any of the residents in that area just because it's a large user of electricity.” The College Station City Council is scheduled to meet on Thursday to continue discussions on the proposal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The decisions postponed BlackRock's Ethereum staking proposal alongside Franklin Templeton's spot XRP and Solana ETF applications. The decisions postponed BlackRock's Ethereum staking proposal alongside Franklin Templeton's spot XRP and Solana ETF applications. The postponements position these applications for potential approval during an anticipated October batch decision window, aligning with previous predictions. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted in April that crypto ETFs would likely get a batch of approvals in October, when some of the over 90 filings reach their final deadlines. The SEC has been working with US exchanges on a standardized listing framework for token-based ETFs that would eliminate individual rule-change requests for qualifying assets. Under the proposed framework, sponsors would submit registration statements on Form S-1, observe standard 75-day review periods, and list products once the waiting periods have ended. Market capitalization, on-exchange trading volume, and daily liquidity represent key metrics under discussion for qualification thresholds. The current rule-change pathway requires each spot crypto ETF to secure a Commission order before listing, a process designed for novel or complex products. Learn how pros avoid bagholding, spot insider front-runs, and capture alpha — before it's too late. Moving to standing rules for qualifying assets would shorten timelines and reduce iterative comment cycles between the agency and applicants. Eric Balchunas said on Sept. 9 that the “memecoin ETF era [is] about to kick off” with a Dogecoin ETF slated for launch on Sept. 11 under the 40 Act structure. Balchunas said this could potentially become “the first-ever US ETF to hold something that has no utility on purpose,” considering Dogecoin was originally created as a tribute to the Doge meme. A successful Dogecoin ETF launch could catalyze broader approval momentum for pending applications. Seyffart previously shared that there are 92 crypto ETF applications divided across various assets, including Solana, XRP, Litecoin, and staking versions of existing products awaiting SEC decisions. The comprehensive filing list reveals applications from major issuers, including VanEck, Grayscale, Canary, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton, covering assets ranging from established cryptocurrencies to emerging tokens.
