                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fernando Alonso has shared the untold story behind what he believes to be his best drive in Formula 1 up to this point, picking out an “anonymous” performance at the Malaysian Grand Prix a decade-and-a-half ago. Alonso is the most experienced driver on the F1 grid, having made his debut back in 2001 and racked up 417 starts so far – scoring more than 2,300 points, 106 podium finishes, 32 wins, 22 pole positions and two world titles as of the 2025 Italian Grand Prix. However, rather than any of those successes topping his list of greatest races across that period, the 44-year-old Spaniard would go back to the early-2010s and a particularly challenging Sunday afternoon with Ferrari. Speaking in an interview with Maaden, a partner of his current team Aston Martin, Alonso instead made reference to the 2010 Malaysian Grand Prix, where race-long gearbox and clutch issues blighted his efforts to recover from 19th on the grid (following a shock Q1 exit amid changeable weather conditions). “There are many races that people were not maybe aware of,” said Alonso, reasoning why he did not choose one of his legendary wins, such as the 2012 European Grand Prix in Valencia, which saw him charge from 11th to the top step of the podium. “It was Malaysia, Sepang [in 2010], where I had a problem on the gearshift. “Out of desperation, I tried to blip the throttle on a downshift, because if not I would retire the car in that lap. An engine failure a couple of laps from the chequered flag left Alonso 13th in the overall classification, without a point to his name, but even today he takes great pride from the performance he was able to deliver while managing so many issues. “The engineers said [after the race], ‘I don't know [how] you came [up] with that solution that fast, because that could be a solution, but you did it like in 13 or 14 seconds, the second corner after you had a problem',” added Alonso. “[It was] completely anonymous, no one will remember that race, but the level of energy that I had to put [into] that race, the level of concentration, focus, and [to] instinctively come out with a solution [to] a problem that was never tested or experienced… I think it was quite a race to remember.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Cooldown Room: Fact or fiction with Pietro Fittipaldi Kick Sauber driver Gabriel Bortoleto is this week's guest on the Beyond The Grid podcast. Aged 11, Gabriel Bortoleto left Brazil, determined to make it in motorsport. His family's passion, hard work and sacrifice gave him a start. His talent saw him accelerate towards a racing career. A two-time World Champion saw he was special, and helped guide him to Formula 1. Speaking to Beyond The Grid host Tom Clarkson, Bortoleto looks back at his childhood, how his parents worked hard to fund his racing dream, how he made the difficult decision to leave them behind and go to Europe to further his career, and why Fernando Alonso's support was essential as he climbed the racing ladder. He explains how he is adjusting to the driving and living in the World Championship, the pride he feels representing Brazil, and what racing against experienced team mate Nico Hulkenberg is teaching him. The Kick Sauber driver also reflects on how his manager and on-track rival Alonso continues to help him, and why he spends hours on his home simulator immediately after every race weekend.
