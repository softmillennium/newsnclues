Far-right ex-president was found to have led a ‘criminal organisation' to try to stay in power

Bolsonaro found guilty of plotting military coup

Brazil's supreme court has made Jair Bolsonaro the first former president in the country's history to be convicted for attempting a coup.

The 70-year-old far-right leader claims he is the victim of political persecution, but three out of five judges concluded on Thursday that it was sufficiently proven that Bolsonaro and his close allies attempted to overturn the 2022 election, which he lost to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

Seven other members of his administration were also convicted, including senior military officers – something also unprecedented in a country that endured a brutal two-decade military dictatorship (1964–85).

After months of investigation, the federal police and the attorney general concluded that a “criminal organisation” led by Bolsonaro carried out a long list of different ways to keep the former paratrooper in power at all costs.

The plot included a plan to assassinate Lula, his vice-president and Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who in 2022 was presiding over the electoral court. After the election, Lula and Moraes were closely monitored by special forces soldiers.

According to investigators, the murderous plot was abandoned only because Bolsonaro managed to win over just one of the three armed forces chiefs, the navy commander, while the heads of the air force and the army refused to join.

The climax of the power-grab attempt was the riot on 8 January 2023, a week after Lula took office, when hundreds of Bolsonaro supporters ransacked the presidential palace, congress and supreme court in the capital, Brasília.

The only judge to acquit Bolsonaro was Luiz Fux, who argued that the prosecution had failed to prove the former president's guilt. He also contended that the trial should be annulled, saying the supreme court was not the proper venue and endorsing a defence claim that, because the investigation generated about 70 terabytes of documents, Bolsonaro's lawyers had been unable to review all the case materials.

The sentence is due to be announced on Friday. Although the five crimes of which Bolsonaro was accused carry a combined sentence of 43 years, the former president's age and the fact that he is a first-time offender may reduce the punishment.

Bolsonaro has been under house arrest since 4 August, accused of trying to intimidate the supreme court's judges through a campaign led by his son Eduardo Bolsonaro in the US that resulted in tariffs and sanctions imposed by Donald Trump.

The former president still has the right to appeal, although the margin of his conviction makes it unlikely it will be overturned. Once the appeals are concluded, probably in October or November, the justices will decide where he will serve his sentence.

Given his recurring health problems, linked to a stabbing during the 2018 campaign, Bolsonaro will probably remain under house arrest, in a hospital or in a special unit inside a barracks or police facility.

Even before this week's conviction, Bolsonaro was already barred from forthcoming elections due to two previous rulings by the electoral court, one for attacking the voting system and another for using the presidency for electoral purposes.

Brazil's largely conservative congress, however, may vote on an amnesty bill for him and hundreds of those convicted over the 8 January riot. Justices have already deemed the proposal unconstitutional, so if it passes, a judicial battle is expected.

Meanwhile, figures on the far right – including Bolsonaro's politician sons and his wife – are battling to decide who will be the candidate to take on the leftist president Lula, who has announced his intention to run in the 2026 elections.

Trump has described the case as a “witch-hunt” against Bolsonaro and used it as one of the justifications for his 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports, but most Brazilian legal experts agree there was substantial evidence for conviction and that due process was observed.

Trump revoked the visas of Moraes and other justices of Brazil's supreme court. Moraes was also targeted with Magnitsky sanctions, generally reserved for perpetrators of severe human rights violations.

Asked about the trial on Tuesday, the White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that “the president is unafraid to use the economic might, the military might of the United States of America, to protect free speech around the world”.

In response, Brazil's government issued a statement that “condemns the use of economic sanctions or threats of force against our democracy” and “repudiates the attempt by anti-democratic forces to instrumentalise foreign governments to coerce national institutions”.

            The majority of a Brazilian Supreme Court panel has voted to convict former President Jair Bolsonaro of planning to overturn the country's 2022 election, in a plot prosecutors say contemplated assassinating the president-elect in a bid to cling to power.
    


            The decision in the landmark case became apparent on Thursday when the third judge of the five-member panel determined that Bolsonaro was guilty of all five counts he faced.
    


            Bolsonaro has been charged with plotting a coup d'état, taking part in an armed criminal organization, attempting to abolish Brazil's democratic order by force, committing violent acts against state institutions and damaging protected public property during the storming of government buildings by his supporters on January 8, 2023.
    


            Part of the coup plot, prosecutors alleged, involved a plan to potentially use explosives, weapons of war or poison to assassinate leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, his Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversaw Bolsonaro's trial.
    


            Bolsonaro and other defendants in the trial have denied wrongdoing.
    


            The evidence against Bolsonaro largely centered on how he tried to stay in power after losing the presidential election in 2022 to Lula da Silva. Federal police said Bolsonaro had “full knowledge” of a plan to overturn the election results, pressure the military to intervene, and even create a parallel “crisis management office” to run the government.

            Prosecutors had alleged that the coup plot began in 2021, with efforts to undermine public trust in the electoral system. After Bolsonaro's defeat in the 2022 election, prosecutors said defendants attempted to overturn the results by encouraging Bolsonaro supporters to mobilize in Brasília, where they stormed and vandalized the three seats of government on January 8, 2023.
    


            Moraes, who was the first justice to cast a guilty vote on Tuesday, said the defendants “committed all the criminal offenses imputed by the Attorney General's Office.”
    


            Justices Flávio Dino and Cármen Lúcia also voted to convict, sealing Bolsonaro's fate with a simple majority of three judges. One more Supreme Court justice still needs to vote this week before the decision can be formally concluded.
    


            The guilty verdict means Bolsonaro, who is 70, could face decades in prison. The Supreme Court panel is expected to discuss sentencing after all the justices have voted.
    


            Defense lawyers could still file appeals, but once those challenges are exhausted, the ruling becomes final and any prison terms can be enforced.
    


            The trial, which comes ahead of the 2026 general election, has polarized Brazil. Over the weekend, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters filled the streets on the country's Independence Day to protest the legal proceedings.
    


            Bolsonaro has long insisted that the trial amounted to a political witch hunt.
    


            That sentiment has been echoed by one of his biggest political allies, US President Donald Trump.
    


            In July, Trump imposed a 50% tariff on Brazil after threatening to do so if the country did not end the trial against the former president. His administration has also sanctioned Moraes for what it considers “serious human rights violations,” and announced visa restrictions against him and other court officials over Bolsonaro's trial.
    


            Bolsonaro's supporters and some on Brazil's right have welcomed Trump's interest in the case. But the current administration in Brasília, and many others in the Latin American nation, see it as the US meddling in its affairs.
    


            Justice Luiz Fux on Wednesday voted to acquit the former president of all charges. He argued that the events do not constitute a coup as Lula da Silva was never overthrown. He also said the court lacks jurisdiction to review the case, which he said should be annulled.
    


            Bolsonaro joins a growing list of Latin American leaders to be convicted of a crime in recent years.
    


            Last month, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe was sentenced to 12 years of house arrest after being found guilty of procedural fraud and witness bribery – a verdict he is appealing.
    


            In 2022, Argentina's ex-leader Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was convicted of corruption related to public works contracts.
    


            And in 2017, Brazil's current President Lula da Silva was found guilty of corruption and money laundering, serving more than a year in prison before his conviction was later annulled.

Deputy secretary of state says ‘foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors'

US politics – live updates

Action will be taken against foreigners in the United States who are considered to be “praising, rationalizing, or making light of” Charlie Kirk's death, a top state department official has said.

The statement comes in a wider context of an aggressive crackdown on free speech and dissenting views in the US under the second Trump administration, especially when it comes to campus protests sparked by Israel's war on Gaza.

In a post on X on Thursday morning, the deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, wrote that “foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country” and said he had directed consular officials to “undertake appropriate action” against those deemed to be “praising, rationalizing, or making light of” Kirk's death on social media.

Landau invited X users to bring such cases to his attention in the comments of his post, which he said would be monitored by consular officials.

Kirk, a close Trump ally and rightwing provocateur, was shot and killed while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, on Wednesday. His death has shocked the nation and prompted outrage across the political spectrum.

A state department spokesperson said: “This administration does not believe that the United States should grant visas to persons whose presence in our country does not align with US national security interests.”

Previously the Trump administration has directed investigators at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), who would typically target human traffickers and drug smugglers, to track down foreign students who may have shown sympathy for the Palestinian cause or criticized Israel in social media posts. The administration has gone after those who have taken part in pro-Palestinian demonstrations across university campuses.

Investigators also now look for “anti-American” views, including on social media, when assessing the applications of people wanting to live in the United States, with diplomats instructed to look for “indications of hostility towards citizens, culture or founding principles of United States” in someone's online presence.

Diplomats must flag any “advocacy for, aid or support for foreign terrorists and other threats to US national security” and “support for unlawful antisemitic harassment or violence”.

New social media vetting measures for international students applying to study in the US even include a requirement for individuals to unlock their social media profiles for review before receiving educational and exchange visas.

Expanding such social media vetting to encompass commentary on an event such as Kirk's death would be a significant expansion of the administration's efforts to restrict dissenting views and opinions, particularly of “foreigners” in the US.

Trump, along with other prominent conservatives and Republicans, have been quick to blame “radical left political violence” for Kirk's killing.

In a speech in the Oval Office, the US president called Kirk the “best of America”, and listed acts of violence that he attributed to the left while omitting violence against Democrats, such as the murder of Melissa Hortman, a prominent Minnesota state lawmaker, and her husband, and the shooting of another Democratic state lawmaker and his wife in June.

Meanwhile, MSNBC fired its senior political analyst Matthew Dowd after he suggested on air that Kirk's own radical rhetoric may have contributed to the circumstances around his assassination. Kirk had a history of rightwing provocation and Christian nationalism, and frequently espoused bigoted rhetoric about Islam, women , LGBTQ+ communities and people of color.

The cost of food and other household items saw a big jump in August alone.

New economic data released on Thursday revealed fresh signs of stress for the US economy and working families.

A new Consumer Price Index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) found that overall inflation rose by 2.9% year-over-year in August, while core inflation — a measure that excludes commodities such as food and energy — rose 3.1%, the highest reading recorded since this past January.

Both of these numbers were in line with economists' consensus estimates, although they still showed inflation trending in the wrong direction during a time when the US labor market is also showing signs of weakness.

Looking deeper into the report reveals that the cost of groceries continues to be a major pain point for US consumers, as food prices jumped by 0.6% on the month and 2.7% year-over-year.

The report comes days after US President Donald Trump said in a radio interview, “We have no inflation. Prices are down on just about everything.”

New York Times economics reporter Ben Casselman said that the spike in food prices was notable because it came after a long period in which food inflation had been coming down.

“Grocery prices are once again rising relatively rapidly,” he observed in a social media post. “Food inflation had eased significantly, and had been running well below overall prices, but that's no longer true.”

Heather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, singled out some particularly important household staples in the report that she argued were very likely being impacted by President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Among other things, Long said that coffee was now 21% more expensive than it was a year ago, while living room and dining room furniture saw a 10% year-over-year increase, and the price of toilet paper rose by an annualized 5%.

“The middle-class squeeze from tariffs is here,” she said. “Inflation hit 2.9% in August, the highest since January and up from 2.3% in April. It's troubling that so many basic necessities are rising in price again: Food, gas, clothing, and shelter all had big cost jumps in August. And this is only the beginning.”

Mike Konczal, senior director of policy and research at the Economic Security Project and a former member of President Joe Biden's National Economic Council, said that the new report shows “inflation is broadening” given that the “percent of items that had at least a 3% annualized price increase over the last month” increased to nearly 60%, which is the highest percentage seen in years.

The inflation report was not the only troubling economic indicator, however.

The BLS also revealed that jobless claims in the US jumped to 263,000 last week, which was significantly higher than the 235,000 claims expected by economists. Joe Weisenthal, the co-host of the Bloomberg “Odd Lots” podcast, noted that this was the highest total for weekly jobless claims in nearly four years.

Long also flagged the worrying jobless claims number and predicted that it was just the start of a further downturn in the US economy.

“‘Cost cutting' is back among CEOs and that is corporate speak for more layoffs,” she said. “It's going to be a rough few months ahead as the tariffs impacts work their way through the economy. Americans will experience higher prices and (likely) more layoffs.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

In recent months, at least two people on the unit have attempted suicide and at least three have gone on hunger strike.

People in a New York prison's mental health unit are kept in their cells 24 hours a day, with the exception of an occasional “callout,” and denied therapeutic services, according to a lawsuit filed this week by Disability Rights New York and Prisoners' Legal Services of New York against New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS), among others. 

“Defendants are knowingly depriving individuals in the Residential Mental Health Unit (“RMHU”) at Marcy Correctional Facility (“Marcy”) of all out-of-cell programming and mental health and medical treatment and keeping them almost entirely isolated,” the lawsuit states. 

The unit was opened more than 15 years ago in response to a lawsuit filed by Disability Advocates, Inc., Prisoners' Legal Services, and others, which alleged that people with serious mental illness were kept in isolation and denied mental health services, the same conditions that allegedly exist today. 

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

State regulations mandate that people in the RMHU are offered seven hours of out-of-cell time each day — four hours of therapeutic programming and/or mental health treatment, and three hours for group programming, services, treatment, recreation and/or meals.

“Now, sixteen years after its opening, Defendants are operating the Marcy RMHU in precisely the same manner as the segregated confinement housing units it was created to redress,” the lawsuit states. 

The suit alleges that some people in the unit were receiving out-of-cell programming and services until the correctional officers went on an illegal strike in February after the Times Union reported that officers involved in the death of Robert Brooks would be criminally charged. In December, Marcy prison guards beat Brooks while he was handcuffed and in the prison's medical ward. The brutal attack was captured by the officers' body cameras, which they thought they had turned off. 

There are currently about 95 people housed in Marcy's RMHU. They receive their meals through a slot in their steel cell door — the same opening that is used to handcuff them before they leave the cell. The unit lacks air conditioning, causing the cells to become unbearably hot in the summer. 

People in the unit are confined to their cells and recreation pens “all day, every day absent an emergency, outside visit, disciplinary hearing, or a brief medical encounter, such as for insulin injection,” the suit says. Counselors, therapists, and psychiatrists speak with the men through the cell's grate-covered window, which, for some people, is also covered with plexiglass. 

A recreation pen is attached to each cell. The pens, described in the suit as “an empty cage with a solid ceiling,” are often “filthy from both debris and human feces that are frequently thrown by incarcerated individuals from their recreation pens.”

To receive medical or mental health care, people in the unit must “yell through the grate-covered window in their cell door.” Staff typically ignore their calls or are delayed in responding, the suit says. 

On August 6, a person yelled “SUICIDE” from their cell. Staff did not show up until two to five minutes later, and mental health staff arrived five to 10 minutes after that. The person was not brought out of his cell for assessment or observation, the suit says. 

One of the plaintiffs, Jose Cornejo, who has been in the unit since 2024, reported that in July he heard another incarcerated person scream for mental health help because he was in crisis. The man did not receive mental health treatment, and Cornejo saw him hang himself, according to the complaint. 

Since February, at least two people on the unit have attempted suicide, and, in the last four months, at least three have gone on hunger strike to protest the conditions, according to the complaint. Dejour Nesmith, one of the strikers, stopped his hunger strike because he was shown a piece of paper that said “force feed order.” 

Another plaintiff, Tyrell Escobar, reported that an officer assaulted him in August. Escobar has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), among other mental health disorders. 

“He called me a “f***ing n***er” and slammed my fingers in the window of the cell door,” Escobar said, as per the complaint. 

The suit says Escobar's ring finger on his right hand “appears to be broken and his middle finger is bruised and crooked.” He did not receive X-rays until almost three weeks after the attack.

Plaintiff Luis Garcia has put in about 10 “sick call” slips, but has not been taken to see a nurse or doctor. Although he's “classified as an OMH Level 1SV patient, meaning he requires the highest level of services offered by OMH [Office of Mental Health] in DOCCS,” Garcia is rarely taken out of his cell. 

Since he arrived at the unit in March, he has often thought about suicide.

“[My] mental health is getting worse because of being confined to my cell,” Garcia said, as per the complaint. “I do not know how much longer I can survive this treatment.”

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week' is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days.



            Fashion is fickle, and not many people can hold their own against the changing tide of trends. But yesterday Jennifer Aniston, while on her way to appear on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” in New York, proved once again she sits in that exclusive crowd.
    


            Promoting the latest season of the US drama series “The Morning Show,” Aniston stepped out in a black halter-neck mini dress, complete with a belted drop-waist. This fresh update on the classic little black dress (also known as the LBD) was the work of Tom Ford — a designer Aniston has kept close since the 1990s.
    


            Even before launching his eponymous label in 2005, Ford's designs were worn by Aniston on the cover of magazines and red carpets. She even starred in his last fashion campaign for Gucci in 2004 (that year, Ford stepped down as the designer of the Italian house — a role he had held since 1994). “I go to him for fashion help,” Aniston said in a 2010 Glamour magazine interview.
    


            When Ford began his own namesake brand in 2005, their sartorial relationship blossomed even further. In 2011, Ford released a leather messenger-style bag with double zip detailing and christened it the “Jennifer” bag, inspired by and named after Aniston. The actor, who owned the style in brown, black and oversized, frequently wore it throughout the 2010s — often pairing it with her “Jennifer” sunglasses, also designed for her by Ford.

            As the Tom Ford brand enters a new era, with designer Haider Ackermann at the helm, Aniston is still flying the flag. Earlier this month she returned to Glamour magazine again, this time on the cover alongside her “Morning Show” co-stars, wearing a grey Tom Ford vest and slacks. Her outfit this week proved that her enduring friendship with Ford, which has lasted over 30 years, is still going strong — as is her reputation as a style icon.

Critics say Trump is exploiting the killing for his own purposes while fueling more political violence.

Despite the fact that the murderer of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk remained unidentified and still at large, President Donald Trump declared the “radical left” as “directly responsible” for the assassination in remarks from the White House on Wednesday night — comments that critics say shows Trump is more than willing to exploit the killing for his own purposes while sowing more, not less, political violence in the future.

In a video address from the Oval Office, Trump said that criticism of Kirk from the left was “directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.”

The president didn't specify which opponents of Kirk he believed contributed to his killing; over the years the influencer, who frequently visited college campuses to debate students, clashed with and was criticized by supporters of abortion rights, gun control, and immigrants' rights. But Trump said his administration would “find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it.”

Trump did not detail how the White House would determine what groups “contributed” to Kirk's killing.

“Radical left political violence has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives,” he asserted, though he did not mention any of the political violence — which is statistically more pervasive — on the political right.

The president was echoing sentiments expressed by far-right influencer Laura Loomer who has played a key role in shaping the Trump administration, lobbying for the hiring and removal of certain aides.

“It's time for the Trump administration to shut down, defund, and prosecute every single leftist organization,” Loomer said Wednesday, even before Kirk was publicly pronounced dead. “We must shut these lunatic leftists down. Once and for all. The left is a national security threat.”

In a Thursday op-ed for Common Dreams, author and journalist Christopher D. Cook laments how “Kirk had barely been declared dead when President Trump hideously used his killing to falsely blame and attack the left.”

The president, writes Cook, “seized the moment of widespread mourning to spread more hatred and division, in a reckless, angry televised speech that hurled blame at the left despite not a scintilla of evidence about Kirk's assassin or their politics.”

Trump named a number of victims of political violence in recent years, including US Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), who was shot in 2017 by a man who opposed the president; and Trump himself, who survived two assassination attempts last year.

The president did not mention the killing earlier this year of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, a Democrat. The suspect in Hortman's killing was an evangelical Christian who strongly opposed abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) also asserted without any evidence that critics of the far-right agenda that Kirk embraced were to blame for his killing, specifically suggesting that her Democratic colleagues were implicated in the assassination.

“Democrats own what happened today,” she told reporters. “Some raging leftist lunatic put a bullet through his neck.”

Mace added that it was “ridiculous” to suggest that by her logic, Republican lawmakers “own” Hortman's assassination.

The comments from Trump and Mace, wrote Cook, only show that these are “not the people who are going to lead us out of this ugly toxic pit” of political violence now pervasive in the United States.

At Zeteo, journalist Mehdi Hasan listed several other recent acts of political violence in which the suspected or confirmed perpetrators held right-wing ideologies, including the attempted assassination of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro earlier this year; the assault of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband in 2022; and the attempted kidnapping of Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020.

“There is no equivalent or even similar list of Obama or Biden supporters who have carried out murders, attempted murders, or violent attacks against Republicans or conservatives in recent years,” wrote Hasan. “In fact, according to statistics compiled by the ADL's Center on Extremism, 2024 was the third year in a row in which all of the extremist-related killings in the United States were carried out by… right-wingers.”

On the social media platform X, Texas Monthly senior writer Robert Downen pointed out that some far-right white supremacists had also “reviled” Kirk.

“I'm not speculating about the shooter,” said Downen. “I just have been stunned how quickly people have jumped with certainty to partisan conclusions. Because in extremism spaces, the Charlie Kirk Hater-to-Nazi pipeline is canon. It's how we got a generation of antisemitic extremists.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was quick to rebuke the suggestion that Democrats or left-wing groups are to blame for the rise in politically motivated attacks or the emergence of violence as a commonplace, acceptable occurrence in American culture.

“Oh, please,” she said when a reporter asked her whether Democrats should tone down their rhetoric. “Why don't you start with the president of the United States, and every ugly meme he has posted, and every ugly word.”

In a podcast put together Wednesday evening in the wake of Kirk's assassination, journalist David Sirota said that “what we desperately need right now in this country are leaders who lower the temperature, leaders who will try to pull us back from the brink.”

Instead, Sirota warned, “we have a president right now who seems mostly interested in using the bully pulpit to actually bully people. Inflaming every cultural conflict he can stick his nose into—all for the cause of grabbing more power and money for himself and his family.”

In place of more anger, hatred, and calls for political retribution, Sirota told his audience he wanted to offer a different message.

“It's a simple message whether you are a leftist, a liberal, a centrist, a conservative, or a MAGA fan,” said Sirota. “Your life has value and your political opponents' lives have value too. You can hate your adversaries' ideas, and you can fight hard for your cause, but the moment we stop seeing each other as human beings and we start concluding that violence is the answer, that's the moment we let the soulless corporations, the ruthless authoritarians, and the sociopathic demagogues win.”

The “nihilism” and “greed” of too many, he added, “are creating the conditions for a civil war—one that we must all do our part to stop. Before it becomes unstoppable.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Even as the suspect and motive remain unknown, incendiary rhetoric from major political commentators spread rapidly online and Trump blamed the left

Charlie Kirk shooting – follow the latest updates

Full report: FBI says it found weapon as hunt for suspect continues

Within hours of Charlie Kirk being shot dead at a college event in Utah, he had been turned into a far-right martyr in the US's raging culture war. Many prominent rightwing voices and influencers quickly characterized his murder, in no uncertain terms, as an act of war from the left – and have vowed to respond in kind.

“We have to have steely resolve,” said the conservative political strategist Steve Bannon on his show War Room. “Charlie Kirk is a casualty of war. We are at war in this country. We are.”

Even as the suspect – and any information about their motivations or political leanings – remained at large and unknown, incendiary rhetoric from major political commentators spread rapidly online, blaming leftist violence for Kirk's death. Many called for swift retribution in the form of an aggressive crackdown against their political enemies.

“If they won't leave us in peace, then our choice is to fight or die,” wrote Elon Musk on X.

“They are at war with us, whether we want to accept it or not. What are we gonna do about it?” Fox News host Jesse Watters said on air Wednesday night. “Everybody's accountable … the politicians, the media, and all these rats out there. This can never happen again. It ends now. This is a turning point and we know which direction we're going.”

“We are up against demonic forces from the pit of Hell,” wrote commentator and podcaster Matt Walsh on X. “This is existential. A fight for our own existence and the existence of our country.”

While all three living former presidents released statements addressing Kirk's death, condemning political violence while calling for calm, introspection and civility, Donald Trump put out a video statement on Wednesday night saying that rhetoric from “the radical left” was “directly responsible for the terrorism we are seeing in our country today”.

Trump vowed to “find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence”. He listed a number of other violent incidents, including his own attempted assassination, as well as attacks on Ice agents and the shooting of Steve Scalise, the US House majority whip, at a congressional baseball game in 2017. (Trump did not mention the two Democratic lawmakers from Minnesota who were shot, one fatally, along with their spouses in June).

Kirk, 31, shaped gen Z conservatism on college campuses through his organization Turning Point USA, leveraging rhetoric about “liberal rot” in education and “cultural marxism” to galvanize a young generation of Trump supporters.

Through his 20s, Kirk became one of the most influential voices in the Maga movement, and enjoyed close proximity to Trump and his allies. He was also known for voicing bigoted and controversial views, calling for a total ban on transgender healthcare, describing immigration from Muslim countries as “civilizational suicide”, and peddling conspiracy theories about the results of the 2020 election. He was on stage at an event at the Utah Valley University in Orem, opining about recent acts of violence, including the shooting at a Minnesota Christian school by a person who identified as transgender, when he was shot from about 130 meters away.

The shooting represents a disturbing escalation in the growing crisis of political violence in the US.

Jon Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, fears that the reaction from the right will lead to further acts of violence.

“The singular message emerging from across the right is one of vengeance and retribution,” said Lewis.

“The rhetoric being used by elected officials and mainstream figures is indistinguishable from the vitriolic statements by far-right extremists, which only further increases the likelihood of retaliatory vigilante violence.”

Many prominent voices on the right claimed that media comparisons between the Trump administration's recent actions and those of authoritarian or fascist governments have functioned as intentional pretext for violence.

Following Kirk's shooting, Mollie Hemingway, the editor-in-chief of the Federalist, a conservative online magazine, described these comparisons as “assassination prep rhetoric”.

“We have a very serious problem with the media and other prominent Democrat activists prepping the ground for open season on and assassination of conservatives,” she wrote on X.

“You called us Hitler. You called us Nazis. You called us Racists,” posted Katie Miller, a conservative political adviser and wife of Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff. “You have blood on your hands.”

Some have called for the Trump administration to take aggressive action against those perceived to be complicit. “It is time, within the confines of the law, to infiltrate, disrupt, arrest, and incarcerate all of those who are responsible for this chaos,” wrote Christopher Rufo.

“The best way President Trump can reinforce Charlie's legacy is by cracking down on the left with the full force of the government,” wrote Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist. “Every single left wing group that funds violent protests needs to be shut down and prosecuted.”

White supremacist Matt Forney, in a post that has been viewed over one million times, compared Kirk's death to the Reichstag fire of 1933 (the arson attack on the German parliament building by a Dutch communist, which Hitler used to justify his aggressive crackdown against communists). “It is time for a complete crackdown on the left,” said Forney. “Every Democratic politician must be arrested and the party banned under RICO … they caused this.”

Overnight, a blacklist website was set up to name and shame people who were perceived as “celebrating” Kirk's death on social media. The website is called “Charlie's Murderers”.

Nick Freitas, the Republican Virginia state delegate and commentator, suggested that Kirk's death marked a major turning point for the future of the US.

“I don't think they realize it yet, but murdering Charlie is going to be remembered as the day where we finally woke up to what this fight really is,” Freitas wrote. “It's not a civil dispute among fellow countrymen. It's a war between diametrically opposed worldviews which cannot peacefully coexist with one another. One side will win, and one side will lose.” His statement was shared nearly 35,000 times on X, and was shared across other social media sites, including by Proud Boy Telegram channels.

Dowd said the slain activist's words may have fueled the violence that claimed his life, sparking backlash

Charlie Kirk shooting – follow the latest updates

MSNBC fired its senior political analyst Matthew Dowd after he suggested on air that the slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk's own radical rhetoric may have contributed to the shooting that killed him.

During his appearance on Katy Tur Reports, Dowd suggested that Kirk's rhetoric may have contributed to the violence that claimed his life. Kirk, 31, had a history of rightwing provocation and Christian nationalism, and frequently espoused bigoted rhetoric about Islam, women , LGBTQ+ communities and people of color.

“Hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions,” Dowd said, adding: “You can't stop with these sort of awful thoughts you have and then saying these awful words and then not expect awful actions to take place.”

Dowd also speculated about the circumstances of the shooting, saying: “We don't know if this was a supporter shooting their gun off in celebration. So we have no idea about this.”

The network issued an apology and announced Dowd's dismissal, which came shortly after Kirk was shot dead during a question-and-answer session at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, where he was kicking off a nationwide campus debate tour. MSNBC's president, Rebecca Kutler, described Dowd's comments as “inappropriate, insensitive and unacceptable” in a statement posted to social media.

“We apologize for his statements, as has he,” Kutler wrote. “There is no place for violence in America, political or otherwise.”

The network almost immediately severed ties with Dowd, with Deadline reporting that MSNBC had cut its relationship with the analyst citing “furor over remarks he made in the aftermath of the shooting”.

Dowd, who served as chief strategist for George W Bush's 2004 presidential campaign and was formerly a political analyst for ABC News, issued his own apology following the controversy.

Writing on Bluesky, he said: “My thoughts & prayers are w/ the family and friends of Charlie Kirk. On an earlier appearance on MSNBC I was asked a question on the environment we are in. I apologize for my tone and words. Let me be clear, I in no way intended for my comments to blame Kirk for this horrendous attack. Let us all come together and condemn violence of any kind.”

Kirk, co-founder of Turning Point USA and a prominent figure in conservative youth politics who had been credited with boosting the Maga youth vote during the 2024 election, was fatally shot in the neck during the campus event on Wednesday afternoon, with multiple videos of the moment spreading across social media.

Federal authorities are investigating the shooting, with two persons of interest initially taken into custody before being released. Both were briefly detained but released without charge, and a suspect is still at large.

The killing has drawn sharp criticism from across the political spectrum.

            Poland has triggered Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, after the country reported 19 “breaches” of its airspace by Russian drones on Wednesday.
    


            NATO fighter jets shot down multiple Russian drones that violated Polish airspace during an attack on neighboring Ukraine, marking the first time that shots were fired by the alliance since the start of the war in Ukraine. A total of 16 drones were found scattered throughout the country, Poland's interior ministry said later on Wednesday.
    


            Now, NATO allies have formally discussed the situation, which Polish officials have called a “Russian provocation.” This is what you need to know about the invocation of Article 4:
    


            The transatlantic defense alliance employs the principle that an attack on one is an attack on all. Article 4 of its treaty states that any member country can formally bring an issue to the attention of NATO's principal decision-making body, the North Atlantic Council, to meet and discuss next steps with allies.
    


            The article says: “The Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened.”
    


            It should not be confused with Article 5, the cornerstone of the alliance, which states an armed attack on one NATO ally will be considered an act of violence against all members and prompt assistance to the member concerned.
    


            The discussion triggered by Article 4 could “potentially lead to some form of joint decision or action on behalf of the Alliance,” according to NATO. The consultation process is key because all alliance decisions are made by consensus.
    


            The consultation that Poland called for took place Wednesday morning at a regular meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Brussels, Belgium.
    


            Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced the intrusions into his country's airspace on Wednesday, noting that a “large proportion” of the drones entered from Belarus. He called the incident an “unprecedented violation” and confirmed that Poland had invoked NATO Article 4.
    


            Other Polish officials have said that the sheer number of drones made it clear this was a deliberate act by Russia. Polish prosecutors said that at least some of the drones have been identified as Russian versions of the Iranian-designed Shahed, known as Gerbera.
    


            Addressing Poland's parliament on Wednesday, Tusk said that while there was no reason to say that the country was in a state of war, it was closer to a conflict than any time since World War II. He said Poland was facing an “enemy that does not hide its hostile intentions.”
    


            Polish President Karol Nawrocki said Thursday: “The Russian provocation was nothing more than an attempt to test our capabilities and response. It was an attempt to check the mechanism of operation within NATO and our ability to react.” He added: “Thank you, because we passed all these tests.”
    


            On Thursday, Poland's Armed Forces announced a restriction on air traffic in the eastern part of the country through December 9.
    


            The country has also said the UN Security Council will convene an emergency meeting to discuss the drone incursions.
    


            Meanwhile, Russia's defense ministry said in a statement that it had carried out a strike against Ukraine overnight into Wednesday. It said “no targets on the territory of Poland were planned for destruction,” and that the drones it uses in Ukraine have a flight range of no more than 700 kilometers (435 miles). Without providing evidence, Russia called the incident “myths repeatedly spread by Poland in order to escalate the Ukrainian crisis further.”
    


            Article 4 has been triggered seven other times since NATO was formed in 1949.
    


            Most recently, Poland, along with Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia, requested to hold consultations in the immediate aftermath of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
    


            Poland previously invoked Article 4 in March 2014 “following increasing tensions in neighboring Ukraine, as a result of Russia's aggressive actions,” according to the alliance. That move came after Russia's illegal annexation of the Crimean Peninsula.
    


            All of the other rare invocations of Article 4 were by Turkey, which asked for consultations related to threats coming from Iraq and Syria. Turkey last triggered Article 4 in July 2015, following terrorist attacks in the country.
    


            Following the North Atlantic Council meeting on Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that “allies expressed solidarity with Poland and denounced Russia's reckless behavior.”
    


            “A full assessment of the incident is ongoing. What is clear is that the violation last night is not an isolated incident,” Rutte added.
    


            On Thursday, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, US General Alexus Grynkewich, said that it was not yet known if the drone incursion in Poland was an intentional or unintentional act, according to Reuters.
    


            US President Donald Trump reacted to Wednesday's air space incursion with a degree of bemusement. “What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones?” Trump asked in a brief post on Truth Social. “Here we go!”
    


            According to the US State Department, some 10,000 US troops are currently stationed in Poland.

SOCHI, September 11. /TASS/. The United States realizes that instead of inciting Ukraine against Russia, it must focus on tackling the crisis' root causes, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.

"We particularly note that the United States realizes the necessity not to increasingly pit Ukraine against Russia, not to arm Ukraine in order to toss another batch of Ukrainian citizens into that crucible, but to work on removing the crisis' root causes," the top Russian diplomat said at a press conference following a meeting of the Russia-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) for Strategic Dialogue.

"It is precisely on this basis that we will foster dialogue both with the United States and with all our colleagues who are ready to assist in seeking a coordinated solution," the Russian foreign minister said.

Russian drones shot down over Poland were reportedly headed for Rzeszow Airport, a key logistics hub for aid to Ukraine, German media outlets Spiegel and Welt reported on Sept. 11.

Poland confirmed downing Russian drones in its airspace overnight on Sept. 10, marking the first time NATO engaged Moscow's military assets over its territory during the full-scale war in Ukraine.

At least 19 drones entered the Polish airspace, and between three and four were shot down by Polish and NATO aircraft in what Warsaw denounced as a deliberate provocation by Russia.

According to Spiegel, at least five drones targeted the airport near the Polish-Ukrainian border, where two German Patriot air defense systems are stationed.

Dutch F-35 fighter jets were scrambled after an air raid alert and intercepted the drones, shooting down at least three. The remaining two crashed for unknown reasons, Welt reported.

On the night of the large-scale attack, Russian drones not only entered Polish airspace but also violated Lithuanian airspace, according to Welt.

"Based on the available information, we believe the drones most likely entered NATO airspace deliberately," a senior NATO official told Welt.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius echoed this statement, saying that the Russian drones were deliberately directed along this route, Spiegel reported.

"They did not need to fly this way to reach Ukraine. There is no evidence that these drones accidentally flew over Polish territory in such large numbers on this route," Pistorius said, adding that this could be a deliberate operation.

The Rzeszow-Jasionka airport is located less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the Ukrainian border and transports a significant percentage of Western materiel bound for the front lines in Ukraine. It is also a main stopover point for foreign leadership traveling to Kyiv on official visits.

While the government in Kyiv maintains its previous estimate of needing up to $37.5 billion annually, the IMF believes the requirement could be $10–20 billion higher.

U.S. presidential envoy John Cole also announced that the U.S. is lifting sanctions from Belavia airline, Belarus's flag carrier.



The Swedish government decided to increase military aid to Ukraine from 2026 to 2027 to 40 billion Swedish kronor ($3.7 billion) per year.

The causes and circumstances of the death of Oleksandr Borovyk are under investigation, according to a statement.



At least five drones targeted an airport near the Polish-Ukrainian border, according to Spiegel.

The study, based on testimonies of 200 children brought back from occupied territories and Russia, describes Moscow's campaign as the largest, most organized assault on child rights in Europe since the Yugoslav wars.

"We will also discuss increasing pressure on Russia, sanctions, and the importance of lasting peace," Ukraine's Presidential Office Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said.

Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, has arrived in Kyiv on an official visit, multiple Ukrainian news outlets reported on Sept. 11.

"A large number of Russian drones entered Polish airspace — this is an empirical fact that does not require belief," Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said.

"Priorities include Russia's banking sector, banks in third countries that continue trading with Russia, and the 'shadow fleet' infrastructure that funds Russia's war budget," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

The measures, requested by the Polish Armed Forces' operational command, will remain in effect until Dec. 9.

"Last night, Poland's airspace was breached 19 times by drones manufactured in Russia. The assessment of Polish and NATO air forces is that they did not veer off course, but were deliberately targeted," Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said in a video statement.

"We are dealing with a direct technological race in which the advantage will go to those who not only modernize but also stay ahead," Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said.

The FBI has released two photos of a person of interest related to the shooting of MAGA influencer Charlie Kirk on an Utah University campus Wednesday.

The photos show a slim man in a black, long-sleeved shirt with what appears to be an American flag design, wearing a black baseball cap, sunglasses, jeans and sneakers. In one photo, he is seen climbing a staircase.

Police initially said they were using technological tools in a bid to identify the man from security camera footage. But around midday on Thursday, they released the stills to the public in hopes of a tip that would identify him.

The killer of MAGA influencer Charlie Kirk used a high-powered rifle to fire a single bullet from a rooftop before fleeing into an adjacent neighbourhood, police said Thursday. 

The day after Mr. Kirk was gunned down at a public event in the quadrangle of Utah Valley University, authorities were still hunting for his killer. But they said video footage showed the sniper appeared to be a university-aged man and they were confident that he would be identified.

“We will catch this individual,” Beau Mason of the Utah Department of Public Safety told a news conference.

Mr. Kirk was shot dead in front of about 3,000 people as he took part in a debate with audience members, part of one of his regular tours of university campuses. The 31-year-old, a married father of two, was the head of right-wing youth group Turning Point USA and a high-profile ally of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Mr. Mason said that the shooter arrived near the campus, in the Salt Lake City suburb of Orem, at 11:52 a.m., used stairwells to access the roof of a building and then got into position to fire the shot. After the shooting, the killer crossed the roof and jumped off the side of the building, Mr. Mason said, before fleeing into a neighbourhood. Mr. Mason said officers had canvassed the neighbourhood.

Robert Bohls, special agent in charge of the FBI's Salt Lake City office, said police had recovered the murder weapon, a high-powered bolt-action rifle, in a wooded area. He said police also have a print of the shooter's footwear, a palm print and a forearm imprint.

He said the shooter would have “blended-in well” with university students because he appeared to be of about the same age.

Mr. Bohls said the motive for the shooting was still uncertain, but that investigators would “find out why he did it” when they locate a suspect. “I understand there are a lot of questions about motive,” he said.

Police arrested two “persons of interest” in the aftermath of the shooting, but released them both after determining they were not the shooter.

Mr. Mason said the body of Mr. Kirk, who was pronounced dead in hospital after being driven there by private vehicle, would be released to his family on Thursday.

Mr. Trump announced on Thursday that he would posthumously award Mr. Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Who was Charlie Kirk? What to know about the Trump ally shot dead in Utah

“Charlie was a giant of his generation, a champion of liberty, and an inspiration to millions and millions of people,” the President said at the Pentagon, during a memorial ceremony for the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

In an Oval Office video late Wednesday, Mr. Trump vowed to crack down on the “radical left” as a result of the shooting.

“My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity, and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund and support it,” he said.

Mr. Trump did not specify who specifically he planned to target. 

An attendee of the event at a Utah university campus where Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and close ally of President Donald Trump, was shot and killed Wednesday, said "there wasn't any security checkpoints."

Mr. Mason said that the shooter arrived near the campus, in the Salt Lake City suburb of Orem, at 11:52 a.m., used stairwells to access the roof of a building and then got into position to fire the shot. After the shooting, the killer crossed the roof and jumped off the side of the building, Mr. Mason said, before fleeing into a neighbourhood. Mr. Mason said officers had canvassed the neighbourhood.

Robert Bohls, special agent in charge of the FBI's Salt Lake City office, said police had recovered the murder weapon, a high-powered bolt-action rifle, in a wooded area. He said police also have a print of the shooter's footwear, a palm print and a forearm imprint.

He said the shooter would have “blended-in well” with university students because he appeared to be of about the same age.

Mr. Bohls said the motive for the shooting was still uncertain, but that investigators would “find out why he did it” when they locate a suspect. “I understand there are a lot of questions about motive,” he said.

Police arrested two “persons of interest” in the aftermath of the shooting, but released them both after determining they were not the shooter.

Mr. Mason said the body of Mr. Kirk, who was pronounced dead in hospital after being driven there by private vehicle, would be released to his family on Thursday.

Mr. Trump announced on Thursday that he would posthumously award Mr. Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Who was Charlie Kirk? What to know about the Trump ally shot dead in Utah

“Charlie was a giant of his generation, a champion of liberty, and an inspiration to millions and millions of people,” the President said at the Pentagon, during a memorial ceremony for the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

In an Oval Office video late Wednesday, Mr. Trump vowed to crack down on the “radical left” as a result of the shooting.

“My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity, and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund and support it,” he said.

Mr. Trump did not specify who specifically he planned to target. 

An attendee of the event at a Utah university campus where Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and close ally of President Donald Trump, was shot and killed Wednesday, said "there wasn't any security checkpoints."

A federal judge on Sept. 10 ordered four federal agencies to stop banning illegal immigrants from programs such as Head Start, which provides child care for poorer families.

U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy said the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Justice, the Department of Education, and the Department of Labor must halt, at least for now, efforts to remove illegal immigrants from the programs.

More than half of Ukrainian children under Russian occupation were subjected to indoctrination, while some reported torture and sexual violence, according to a report by Save Ukraine and War Child U.K. published on Sept. 11.

The study, based on testimonies of 200 children brought back from occupied territories and Russia, describes Moscow's campaign as the largest, most organized assault on child rights in Europe since the Yugoslav wars.

About 55% of surveyed children reported experiencing indoctrination, 10% said they were subjected to torture or other cruel treatment, and 6% reported sexual violence.

The report, seen by the Kyiv Independent, found that 41% of children were subjected to militarization through weapons training, forced drills, or enrollment in state-sponsored groups such as Russia's Yunarmiya (Youth Army). 

The study also said that 18% of children were separated from their families, another 18% were denied medical care, and 17% reported being detained in police stations, filtration camps, or informal facilities. 

"Every day felt like we were being shaped into something we weren't. They didn't treat us like kids. They wanted us to behave like their soldiers," a 16-year-old girl from Kherson Oblast said in her testimony.

Researchers concluded that Russia aims to erase Ukrainian identity and prepare the children for eventual use in its armed forces, potentially forcing them to fight against their own country.

According to the study's authors, this is the first such report using testimonies of affected children to expose Russia's crimes.

"In each child's eyes, we see fear; in their voices we hear stories of being forced into military camps, punished for speaking Ukrainian or showing any trace of their heritage, and subjected to relentless psychological and physical abuse," said Mykola Kuleba, CEO of Save Ukraine.

"Their very identities are being systematically erased in order to turn them into 'Russian children'."

Helen Pattinson, CEO of War Child U.K., said that it is a "terrifying experience for a child to be separated from their families, let alone be stolen by another state."

"The world cannot look away. We're calling for immediate and impactful action from world leaders to return these children to their homes as the absolute bare minimum," Pattinson added.

The abductions remain a central issue in Kyiv's talks with allies and Moscow. President Volodymyr Zelensky has called the children's return a non-negotiable condition in any peace deal.

Ukraine's Children of War database has recorded 19,546 children abducted by Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion, with only 1,605 being brought back home. Researchers from Yale University estimate that the real figure could be up to 35,000.

In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Children's Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova over their role in the abductions.

While the government in Kyiv maintains its previous estimate of needing up to $37.5 billion annually, the IMF believes the requirement could be $10–20 billion higher.

U.S. presidential envoy John Cole also announced that the U.S. is lifting sanctions from Belavia airline, Belarus's flag carrier.



The Swedish government decided to increase military aid to Ukraine from 2026 to 2027 to 40 billion Swedish kronor ($3.7 billion) per year.

The causes and circumstances of the death of Oleksandr Borovyk are under investigation, according to a statement.



At least five drones targeted an airport near the Polish-Ukrainian border, according to Spiegel.

The study, based on testimonies of 200 children brought back from occupied territories and Russia, describes Moscow's campaign as the largest, most organized assault on child rights in Europe since the Yugoslav wars.

"We will also discuss increasing pressure on Russia, sanctions, and the importance of lasting peace," Ukraine's Presidential Office Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said.

Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, has arrived in Kyiv on an official visit, multiple Ukrainian news outlets reported on Sept. 11.

"A large number of Russian drones entered Polish airspace — this is an empirical fact that does not require belief," Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said.

"Priorities include Russia's banking sector, banks in third countries that continue trading with Russia, and the 'shadow fleet' infrastructure that funds Russia's war budget," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

The measures, requested by the Polish Armed Forces' operational command, will remain in effect until Dec. 9.

"Last night, Poland's airspace was breached 19 times by drones manufactured in Russia. The assessment of Polish and NATO air forces is that they did not veer off course, but were deliberately targeted," Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said in a video statement.

"We are dealing with a direct technological race in which the advantage will go to those who not only modernize but also stay ahead," Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said.

Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, has arrived in Kyiv on an official visit, multiple Ukrainian news outlets reported on Sept. 11.

The reported visit comes only a day after Poland confirmed downing Russian drones in its airspace during an aerial strike on Ukraine, marking the first time a NATO country engaged Moscow's military assets over its territory during the full-scale war.

The purpose of Kellogg's visit is currently unknown, an undisclosed source told Suspilne broadcaster.

Kellogg previously visited Kyiv on Aug. 24 on the occasion of Ukraine's 34th Independence Day. The retired general is one of Trump's top aides in the effort to negotiate a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine and has been in close contact with top Ukrainian officials.

Despite the now months-long push by Washington to end the hostilities, little progress has been made as Russia continues to reject a ceasefire and ramps up attacks on Ukrainian cities.

Tensions in the region are also flaring up after Russia's violation of the Polish airspace, with European officials and some U.S. lawmakers describing it as a test of NATO's resolve.

While Kyiv and most European leaders resolutely denounced the incursion, Trump reacted with a cryptic statement on social media, saying: "What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones? Here we go!"

Ukraine, which has resisted Russia's all-out war for three and a half years and faces near-daily drone attacks, urged a strong response to the incursion from NATO and the EU.

Daily roundup of research and analysis from The Globe and Mail's market strategist Scott Barlow

Scotiabank strategist Kevin Fisk identifies upside in oil and gas stocks that may pleasantly surprise investors,

“At $65 WTI and $4 HH [Henry Hub gas], we expect our coverage of companies to offer investors average 2026 shareholder returns of 6 per cent (dividend and buybacks). Further, AAV, BIR, CNQ, EQT, and TPZ are expected to achieve their net debt targets by the end of 2026 or earlier, which could trigger an increase in shareholder returns. The sector also provides meaningful upside to higher commodity prices with the average shareholder return increasing to 8 per cen7 at $75 WTI and $5 HH. In our view, energy names continue to return a significant amount to capital to investors, even at lower oil prices, and offer investors superior FCF yields relative to other GICS sectors. Current commodity prices support solid share buybacks. Assuming $65 WTI and $4 HH, we model our coverage of companies buying back 2 per cent of their shares in H2/25 and 4 per cent in 2026. We expect natural gas weighted producers to repurchase 5 per cent of their shares in 2026 compared to 3 per cent for oil weighted names due to strong natural gas prices and buy-back focused return strategies. In 2026, CNX, AR, and NVA are the natural gas names expected to repurchase the most shares while OVV, ATH, and PXT are the oil weighted names with the greatest buybacks”

An RBC Capital Markets report highlighted global banks, including Canadian banks, as outperformers in the months ahead,

“Canadian, European and U.S. banks have re-rated and outperformed the market year-to-date due to a favorable economic backdrop, softer regulation and a positive outlook on interest rates. We expect these trends to continue over the next 18 months. Further profitability improvements, strong capital levels and the return of excess capital should lead to robust shareholder returns. The primary risks to our outlooks are political risk and stagflation. Valuation premiums are still heavily correlated to returns (R2 0.81). Whilst we are constructive on the banks overall, UK/Irish and European banks offer the most upside to our price targets, but face near-term headwinds (political); Canadian banks are the most discounted and could see a re-rating if earnings momentum inflects … Canadian banks – BMO, CM, EQB, and BNS We are constructive on the Canadian bank group in our coverage, which trades at the lowest 1yr forward P/TBV premium to historical avg. compared to global peers. BMO is committed to rebuilding ROE to its 15-per-cent-plus medium-term target while CM is executing its strategy well, in our view. PCLs have likely peaked for both and capital ratios / buybacks are solid. EQB's valuation is significantly below what we would view as appropriate for a growth-oriented bank with a solid/improving ROE. BNS trades at one of the highest P/TBV discounts and the lowest P/E premium (both 1yr forward) to historical avg. among the large Canadian banks in our coverage with the highest core ROE improvement and EPS growth in 2026E, offering a reasonable risk-reward balance” 

Citi chief U.S. equity strategist Scott Chronert offered second order winners from AI diffusion,

“The ‘AI trade' for equities initially focused on companies producing AI technologies, the AI ‘enablers.' But the focus is now broadening to include AI “adopters.” As more companies find ways to employ AI technologies, the resulting productivity gains should further propel US equity prices. Even so, this dynamic could leave markets vulnerable if the benefits from AI are less pronounced, or come more slowly, than investors currently expect … Citi's AI Enablers and AI Adopters for companies where implicit growth expectations look attainable given consensus analyst expectations. An important point with both baskets is achieving broad exposures across the AI value chain.”

Mr. Chronert pointed to his (very large) list of “positive ROE trend” stocks where profitability is improving while debt levels decline. Stocks on the list most likely to interest domestic investors include Lockheed Martin Corp., Johnson & Johnson, Netflix inc., Honeywell International, GE Vernova, Eaton Corp., CBRE Group Inc., Corning Inc., Blackrock Inc., Fedex Corp., Salesforce Inc., Keurig Dr Pepper, Walt Disney Co. and Caesar's Entertainment Inc.

The United States, our most important trading partner, is again retreating inward – risking supply chains, making everything more expensive for exporters and undermining the stability upon which our prosperity has rested for so long. 

Meanwhile, we also have a host of authoritarian actors – such as China and Russia – that continue to take advantage of a crumbling international system and are looking to establish a new economic order. 

Here, “business as usual” will not suffice. We can't rely on the worn-out playbook of bought-and-paid-for access to the U.S. market or incremental domestic transformation. We need to be bold and make Canada not just immune to Donald Trump's tariffs but attractive enough to divert capital, brains and innovation away from rival markets. 

That means going beyond trimming Trudeau-era spending or offering marginal corporate tax relief. It means eliminating the capital gains tax altogether.

Carney confirms Liberals will drop planned capital gains tax change

Wealthy Canadians spent big to plan around capital gains tax changes that never happened

Canada's productivity record is terrible. We've lagged behind our G7 allies for decades, and the gap continues to widen. Canadian companies are investing fewer dollars per worker in technology, equipment and research than their rivals. The result: Our workers are less productive, and therefore paid less, than employees in other advanced economies. 

The ultimate issue is not a shortage of talent or capital – Canada has both in abundance – but too little investment. Entrepreneurs and firms are working in an environment that frowns on risk-taking. If rewards on capital are taxed, investors are being charged for putting money into innovative new ventures, expanding businesses and even their own enterprises. They invest elsewhere, far too often south of the border.

If the capital gains tax were eliminated, it would supercharge Canadian investment. It would unleash a gusher of risk capital into startups, scale-ups and infrastructure projects that are currently underfinanced. Canadian investors would have a much stronger incentive to invest in Canadian innovation.

Critics argue that such a reform would disproportionately benefit the wealthy. There is no doubt investors would gain, but this vision is short-sighted. The true beneficiaries would be Canadian businesses and workers. A surge of new capital would mean more startups, more expansion and, ultimately, more jobs.

Mr. Trump's protectionism adds urgency to this reckoning. With rising tariffs and “Buy American” provisions spreading, Canada cannot assume automatic access to the U.S. market any more. 

We can't fight this battle by emulating Washington's protectionism – we're too small, too dependent on exports. We can't follow America's subsidy factory model either. 

What we can do is change the fundamentals by making Canada the most attractive country in North America in which to invest, launch a business and take a risk. Reducing or eliminating capital gains taxes would send precisely that message, balancing the drag of U.S. tariffs with a source of international capital.

Canadians who sold assets based on proposed capital gains tax changes left to deal with the consequences

But this reform must also be guided by principle. A capital-gains-free Canada should not become a magnet for authoritarian wealth. Ottawa must ensure that the benefits are directed toward like-minded partners – firms and investors from rules-based economies. We shouldn't open the door to corrosive investment from regimes such as China and Russia. By aligning tax reform with our values, Canada can position itself not just as an economic competitor, but as a beacon for high-quality, principled investment that strengthens our alliances and reinforces our sovereignty.

Doubters will ask: Can we afford to forgo this revenue? The answer is, can we afford not to? Though capital gains taxes contribute to government coffers, they are a relatively small portion of total federal revenues – less than personal income taxes, corporate taxes or even consumption taxes such as the GST. However, the growth slowdown that results from discouraging investment is enormous.

By unleashing higher productivity and stronger growth, abolishing capital gains taxes would eventually make the tax base wider. More jobs, better wages and more prosperous businesses would generate more income and consumption tax revenues. Over time, the reform would pay for itself and then some.

Prime Minister Mark Carney has the political capital to act. By combining fiscal responsibility – ending wasteful spending and re-establishing discipline – with bold reforms such as rolling back capital gains taxes, his government can reset Canada's trajectory. It can transform it.

MOSCOW, September 11. /TASS/. Forces from the Collective Security Treaty Organization's (CSTO) Rubezh-2025 drills are heading to Kyrgyzstan, Vladislav Shchegrikovich, spokesman for the CSTO Joint Staff, told TASS.

"Participants in the Rubezh-2025 command and staff exercise involving the Collective Rapid Deployment Forces of the Central Asian Region are regrouping to move to the Kyrgyz Republic. The troops of the CSTO (Collective Forces) from Kazakhstan, Russia and Tajikistan are on their way to the areas where the drills are planned to take place," he pointed out.

Shchegrikovich added that the Rubezh-2025 command and staff drills would be held at the Edelweiss training center and on Lake Issyk Kul, with the goal being to practice preparing for and conducting combat operations by the Collective Rapid Deployment Forces of the Central Asian Region aimed at eliminating illegal armed groups invading a CSTO member state.

According to the spokesman, CSTO Joint Staff Head Colonel General Andrey Serdyukov emphasized at a briefing ahead of the joint drills that the activity was a routine one and was not directed against third countries as its goal was to improve the coherence of command units and troops, as well as maintain the preparedness of forces to perform missions focused on ensuring collective security.

Shchegrikovich pointed out that the Collective Rapid Deployment Forces of the Central Asian Region, formed in 2021 based on a decision by the CSTO Collective Security Council, were made up of permanent readiness units and formations, equipped with state-of-the-art weapons and military hardware. "The main objectives of the Collective Rapid Deployment Forces of the Central Asian Region are to counter outside military threats and conduct joint counterterrorism operations," he stressed.

The Associated Press

10:34 JST, September 11, 2025

NEW YORK (AP) — The battle among billionaires for bragging rights as the world's richest person got heated Wednesday with the surprising surge of an old contender: Larry Ellison.

In a stunning few minutes after markets opened, stock in Ellison's Oracle Corp. rocketed more than a third, enough for him to temporarily wrest the title from its longtime holder Elon Musk and hand it to the software giant's co-founder.

But the stock market is fickle, and Musk was back on top by the end of the day, at least according to Bloomberg, as Oracle gave up a bit of its earlier gains.

For those keeping score, the difference now is a billion, which isn't much given the size of the figures: Musk's $384.2 billion versus $383.2 billion for Ellison.

The dueling fortunes are so big each could fund the lifestyles of 5 million typical American families for a year, about the entire population of Florida, allowing them to all quit their jobs. Or they could just tell all of South Africa to take a vacation for year and produce nothing, based on its gross domestic product.

The brief switch in the ranking came after a blockbuster earnings report from Oracle powered by multibillion dollar orders from customers as the artificial-intelligence race heats up.

Musk became the world's richest person for the first time four years ago. A big reason is his stake in a hot, but now cooling, electric car maker, Tesla.

Stock in the company has been moving in the opposite direction of Oracle's, dropping 14% so far this year. Musk also controls several private companies, including rocket maker SpaceX, his artificial intelligence company xAI and the former Twitter, now called X.

Ellison owns about 40% of Oracle, which means its surging stock added $100 billion to his net worth in little over a half-hour after the stock market opened.

The night before after trading had closed the company announced in an earnings report that it had struck more than $300 billion worth of new deals, including contracts with the OpenAI, Meta, Nvidia and Musk's xAI. It said that it now expects revenue from its cloud infrastructure business to jump 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year. then rise to $144 billion in four years after that.

Ellison said in an earnings call that Oracle would not just be making money from its computing centers that help build the next chatbots, but from the day-to-day running of those AI systems to run robots in factories, design drugs in laboratories, place bets in financial markets and automate legal and sales work at companies.

In other words, Ellison's surge in wealth Wednesday morning reflected investor expectations that computers will take over many jobs now done by humans — and Oracle will benefit.

Or as the 81 year old said on the call, “AI Changes Everything.”

Musk is hoping the same for Tesla and his own net worth, but he's been struggling to convince investors.

The company had been promising a big turnaround in electric car sales after they fell sharply earlier this year, but the bounce back hasn't happened. Musk has been downplaying the bad numbers by trying to shift investors' focus to Tesla's other business of making robots and advances in the artificial intelligence behind its cars and robotaxis.

While he keeps talking up the Tesla future, though, the bad news keeps coming.

Tesla sales in the European Union plunged 40% earlier this summer, the seventh month in row of drops, as customers balked at buying his cars after he took to X to support extreme right-wing politicians there. The company has been losing market share in the U.S., too, as buyers angry with his embrace of Donald Trump have stayed away from Tesla showrooms.

Oracle stock closed Wednesday at $328.33, a 36% jump. Tesla was up less than 1% at $347.79.

			How a college drop-out built a Right-wing youth movement and reached the highest echelons of the Trump world

Charlie Kirk leaned into his reputation as a deeply polarising figure, taking his conservative message to the most hostile places he could imagine: America's college campuses.

This helped him build his Turning Point USA movement into a fundraising giant and catapulted him into the highest echelons of Trump world.

On Wednesday he took his rapier wit and his “prove me wrong” roadshow to Utah Valley University. It proved to be his final appearance.

He was cut down by a gunman's bullet as he answered questions about mass shootings in America.

Donald Trump announced his death, illustrating the power of the 31-year-old's reach.

“No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie,” Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Kirk exemplified the confrontational, populist conservatism that brought Mr Trump to power.

Like many he credits the late Rush Limbaugh, the late conservative commentator for igniting his political feelings, tuning into his show during his school lunch breaks in the affluent Chicago suburb of Prospect Heights.

He was turned down by West Point, the US military academy. And by the time he began attending Baylor University, a Christian school in Texas, he had already begun writing for the Right-wing website Breitbart and appearing on Fox News.

To the horror of his parents, in 2012 he dropped out without completing his degree to start spreading the conservative word on campuses and Turning Point USA was born.

“He was 18 going on 46,” Joe Walsh, an Illinois Tea Party congressman who was an early political mentor, told The New York Times. “And his mission, to go on college campuses and introduce the idea of free markets, was a slam dunk for getting money from old Republican farts.”

The 2014 midterm elections brought a breakthrough. The trickle of big donations turned into a tide of money after he appeared in front of wealthy donors in Palm Beach, where then Senator Jeff Sessions was in the audience with his young aide Stephen Miller, now a senior White House official.

Kirk was among the youngest speakers at the Republican National Convention in 2016, when Mr Trump was formally adopted as candidate.

It marked his own personal turning point. He publicly admitted that he was not sure about Mr Trump and described the convention as a “reckoning from the older generation” but went on to campaign for the Republican nominee, finding a place in Donald Trump Jr's team as scheduler and social media coordinator.

“I love you brother,” said Don Jr after Kirk's death had been announced. “You gave so many people the courage to speak up and we will not ever be silenced.”

After the election he returned to his role with Turning Point USA, effectively acting as the Maga movement's envoy to campuses.

He set up “Professor Watchlist,” designed to expose “radical” academics, and he delighted in confronting protesters who tried to derail his appearances.

“We are not afraid to fight back against that, because enough is enough, and conservative students are under attack on college campuses, ideologically and unfortunately, sometimes physically,” he said during a 2017 appearance.

By his own count, he visited the West Wing more than 100 times during the first Trump administration, and the president was a frequent keynote speaker at his rallies.

“You need tremendous talent to do what he's done, building one of the most powerful youth organisations ever created,” said the president in 2019.

At the same time, Kirk was careful to stick to his own lane, staying outside the administration and building up his campus operation, launching a podcast, and becoming a non-stop presence on social media.

He married Erika Frantzve, a former Miss Arizona, in 2021 and the couple have two children.

By the time of the 2024 election, he boasted a $100 million get-out-the vote push, although critics questioned whether much of the money was being directed to contractors owned by friends or associates.

His reward came with election victory in November. Kirk was among the tiny circle of Trump allies who hunkered down at Mar-a-Lago, Mr Trump's Florida estate, to build his administration and vet officials for posts.

“There will never be another Charlie Kirk,” said Steven Cheung, White House communications director. “He is one of one.

“Charlie wasn't just a force of nature in politics, he was a dear friend who would drop everything if you needed him.”

Don Jr said Kirk's fight would live on.

“He poured into millions of young people who will carry forward the torch he lit,” he posted in a heartfelt tribute. “He built something that will outlast him, because it was grounded in faith, in truth, and in courage.”

Bill Melugin reveals more details of the Charlie Kirk assassin, including messages found on the gun and ammunition, palm prints and video surveillance of the moments after the shooting.

The State Department will be monitoring the words of foreign nationals who "glorify violence" after the Charlie Kirk shooting and take "appropriate action." 

"In light of yesterday's horrific assassination of a leading political figure, I want to underscore that foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country," Deputy Secretary of State Chris Landau wrote on X. 

"I have been disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action. Please feel free to bring such comments by foreigners to my attention so that the @StateDept can protect the American people."

Landau said in a subsequent post he would direct his consular officials to monitor replies to his X post calling out foreign nationals in the U.S. on visas who posted such rhetoric. 

In June, the State Department said it would monitor the social media posts of visa applicants and would instruct applicants to set their social media to "public."

The State Department has already revoked over 6,000 student visas, because recipients had either overstayed visas or broken the law. The "vast majority" of legal violations were assault, driving under the influence, burglary or "support for terrorism."

On Wednesday, Kirk, a 31-year-old conservative activist, father of two and co-founder of Turning Point USA, was fatally shot during a speaking event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. The event was part of his "American Comeback Tour," which drew a crowd of about 3,000 attendees.

Kirk was addressing a question from the audience about mass shootings involving transgender individuals when a single shot struck him in the neck. The weapon, later recovered, was a high-powered bolt-action rifle found in a nearby wooded area. Authorities believe the shot came from a rooftop roughly 200 yards away.

While the suspect remains at large, the FBI recently released imagery, imploring the public for help in identifying the shooter.

President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump marked 24 years since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks at a service at the Pentagon on Thursday.

While traditionally observed near the building's memorial outside the Pentagon's walls, it was moved to the internal courtyard following the “heartbreaking political assassination” of activist Charlie Kirk, according to a White House official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The 9/11 remembrances are being held during a time of increased political tensions after Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at a college in Utah.

Other news we're following today:








The Trump administration has asked an appeals court to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's board of governors by Monday, before the central bank's next vote on interest rates.

Trump sought to fire Cook Aug. 25, but a federal judge ruled late Tuesday that the removal was illegal and reinstated her to the Fed's board. Trump has accused Cook of mortgage fraud because she appeared to claim two properties as “primary residences” in July 2021, before she joined the board. Such claims can lead to a lower mortgage rate and smaller down payment than if one of them was declared as a rental property or second home. Cook has denied the charges.

On Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the administration had not satisfied a requirement that Fed governors can only be fired “for cause,” which she said was limited to misconduct while in office. Cook did not join the Fed's board until 2022.

Authorities installed security glass outside a Yankee Stadium suite on the third base side, over the dugout of the visiting Detroit Tigers, in preparation for Trump's arrival for tonight's game.

Security around the stadium was tight even four hours before first pitch, with every entrance featuring metal detectors and Secret Service agents while NYPD helicopters thundered overhead.

Flags for each of baseball's 30 teams that ring the stadium were lowered to half staff after Trump issued an executive order honoring slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Trump is attending the Yankees game as part of marking the 24th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.

A federal judge has issued a nationwide block on a Trump administration directive that prevented children in the U.S. illegally from enrolling in Head Start, a federally funded preschool program.

Head Start associations in several states filed suit against the policy change by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The ruling by a federal judge in Washington state on Thursday comes after a coalition of 21 Democratic attorney generals succeeded in temporarily halting the policy's implementation within their own states.

With the new ruling, the policy is now on hold across the country.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Thursday that 1,001 agencies have signed 287(g) agreements, named for the section of a 1996 law that empowers local police make immigration arrests.

That's up more than seven-fold from 135 agreements at the end of the Biden administration.

ICE says it has agreements in 40 states. Florida leads with 324, followed by Texas with 171. States with no agreements include California, Illinois and New Jersey.

The Trump administration is relying on local police to make immigration arrests while ICE sharply ramps up its own hiring to fulfill the president's promise of mass deportations.

Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau will visit South Korea, Papua New Guinea and the Marshall Islands beginning later this week as the Trump administration and Seoul attempt to extricate themselves from a complicated deportation situation and the U.S. tries to seal a deal with Port Moresby to accept migrant deportees from the United States.

The State Department said in a statement Thursday that Landau would travel to Seoul, Port Moresby and Majuro between Friday and Sept. 18 “to underscore the United States' commitment to strengthening partnerships and alliances in the Indo-Pacific region.”

The statement did not mention the crisis over the arrest by US immigration authorities of several hundred South Korean workers — who are now being repatriated — at a battery plant in Georgia. Nor did the statement mention the ongoing negotiations with Papua New Guinea over accepting migrants who have been deported from the United States.

However, the situation with South Korea has been near the top of the Trump administration's agenda as has its pursuit of countries willing to take in third-country nationals deported from the U.S. for violating immigration laws or applying for asylum.

A bomb threat at the DNC headquarters was determined to be not credible, according to a statement from a DNC spokesperson.

U.S. Capitol Police said after being alerted to the threat, they did not find anything outside of the building. Out of an abundance of caution, they were checking the interior of the building.

“As DNC Chair Ken Martin has said, political violence in every form has no place in our country,” the DNC statement said.

U.S. Capitol Police are responding to a bomb threat at Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, according to a person familiar with the incident who requested anonymity because the situation is fluid.

An email sent to Senate offices said that “staff are asked to remain clear of the police activity” and said more information would be forthcoming.

There was no additional information immediately available.

An Arizona judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's effort to remove Guatemalan and Honduran children living in shelters or foster care after coming to the U.S. alone, according to a decision Thursday.

U.S. District Judge Rosemary Marquez in Tucson extended a decision made over the Labor Day weekend.

Lawyers for the children said their clients have said they fear going home, and that the government is not following laws designed to protect migrant children.

A legal aid group filed a lawsuit in Arizona on behalf of 57 Guatemalan children and another 12 from Honduras between the ages 3 and 17.

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser remembered the victims from the city who died on 9/11 and praised the city's emergency first responders for how they reacted that day, and every day since.

“Our nation changed in an instant in New York City, at the Pentagon, and of course, in the skies over Shanksville, Pennsylvania,” Bowser said in a solemn remembrance at Washington, D.C.'s largest fire station.

Bowser listed the names of those from Washington, D.C., who died in the attacks, including three 11-year-old students who were on Flight 77 when it crashed into the Pentagon. Rodney Dickens, Asia Cottom and Bernard Brown were aboard, along with the educators who were accompanying them.

“We pray for their nearly 3,000 lives lost on that day, and the lives that have been lost since.”

The Trump administration's move of ceremony from the traditional site near the Pentagon's memorial outside its walls into the building's internal courtyard was spurred by the shooting death of conservative activist and influencer, according to a White House official.

Following Kirk's assassination, a decision was made to move the ceremony to the courtyard, said the official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Trump, first lady Melania Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, attended the Thursday morning commemoration.

Both Trump and Hegseth paid tribute to Kirk during remarks at the solemn gathering to mark the 24th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.

A suspect on trial for attempting to assassinate Donald Trump while he played golf in South Florida last year forfeited his right to continue his opening statement on Thursday when a judge objected to his repeated talking about unrelated matters. 

Ryan Routh, representing himself, veered off topic, discussing Adolf Hitler and wars in Ukraine and Gaza during his opening statement in a Fort Pierce, Fla. courtroom. 

U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon warned him to stay on topic and twice asked jurors to leave the courtroom. 

Routh has pleaded not guilty to charges including attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate. The trial, expected to last two or three weeks, began nearly a year after the alleged assassination attempt.

A Maine principals' group is fighting a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice that seeks the names of all students playing interscholastic sports in the state as the justice department attempts to ban transgender athletes from participating.

The Trump administration sued Maine in April for not complying with an executive order barring transgender athletes from sports. The justice department followed up with a subpoena of the Maine Principals' Association, a nonprofit that oversees school sports in Maine, seeking a host of information.

In a Sept. 4 legal filing, the principals' association said the subpoena included “requests for the production of all athletic rosters for the state.”

Crews wearing hardhats and green smocks have begun erecting metal barriers and tents for extra security screening, more than seven hours before tonight's Yankees game where Trump will be in attendance.

Crews are working every entrance at Yankee Stadium. Secret Service agents have also begun arriving with sniffer dogs.

The sniper who assassinated Charlie Kirk is believed to have jumped off a roof and fled into a neighborhood after firing one shot and has not been identified, authorities said Thursday in disclosing they have recovered a high-powered, bolt-action rifle they believe was used in the attack and are reviewing video footage of the person they believe was responsible.

The FBI released photos of a person of interest in Kirk's shooting as investigators appeal to the public for tips.

The shooter appeared to be of college age and blended in on the university campus where Kirk was killed Wednesday, said Beau Mason, the commissioner of the Utah Department of Public Safety. It remained unclear how far the shooter has traveled, though law enforcement officials say nearby woods where the rifle was found have been secured.

A plane carrying more than 300 workers from South Korea who were detained during an immigration raid at a battery factory in Georgia last week left Atlanta shortly before noon Thursday, bound for South Korea.

The workers traveled by bus from a detention center in southeast Georgia to Atlanta earlier in the day for their flight, which is expected to land in South Korea on Friday afternoon. South Korea's Foreign Ministry said the detainees released by U.S. authorities included 316 Koreans, 10 Chinese nationals, three Japanese nationals and one Indonesian.

They were among about 475 workers detained during last week's raid at the battery factory under construction on the campus of Hyundai's sprawling auto plant west of Savannah.

South Korean officials have said they were negotiating with the U.S. to win “voluntary” departures for the workers — rather than deportations that could make them ineligible to return to the U.S. for up to 10 years.

Trump made those remarks in a brief conversation with reporters as he left the Pentagon.

Vice President JD Vance is traveling to Utah on Thursday to meet with Kirk's family in person.

U.S. Treasury sanctioned 32 people and organizations, as well as four ships connected to the Iran-backed Houthi militant group. The people and firms sanctioned are across Yemen, China, the United Arab Emirates and the Marshall Islands.

Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control alleges the people and groups help finance and facilitate the Houthis' acquisition of global fundraising, smuggling and advanced military-grade weapons procurement program.

“We will continue applying maximum pressure against those who threaten the security of the United States and the region,” Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, John K. Hurley said in a statement.

The State Department is warning foreign visa applicants and holders that they could be denied a U.S. visa or deported if they praise or make light of the assassination of conservative American political activist Charlie Kirk.

In an unusual post to X, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said he was personally “disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action.”

Landau has been at the forefront of publicizing the revocations and denials of U.S. visas, having announced earlier this year that he had revoked visas for performer Bob Vylan and his crew after the British punk-rap duo led crowds in chanting “death” to the Israeli military.

“In light of yesterday's horrific assassination of a leading political figure, I want to underscore that foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,” Landau said. He also asked social media users to copy him on any posts they might see that could be relevant.

Democratic Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Jeff Merkey are calling on the Trump administration to take a harder line with Israel following a trip to the region last month to witness the conditions in Gaza.

The senators issued a report that details the findings of their trip to the Gaza border and surrounding region, including that the Israeli government has too many restrictions on humanitarian aid entering Gaza and that the food distribution sites that are allowed are designed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to drive people from northern Gaza.

“In our interviews and through our observations, it was clear that the Netanyahu government is also restricting the delivery of humanitarian assistance into Gaza, including using food as a weapon of war,” Van Hollen said.

Israel's government has strongly denied accusations like that, saying Hamas is to blame for the the lack of food in Gaza. But the senator's report showed how support for Israel in its war against Gaza is eroding among congressional Democrats, many who've spent their political careers in support of Israel.

The Secret Service has joined the Yankees in warning fans of very long security lines being likely for tonight's game, due to President Trump being in attendance.

“If you are attending tonight's @Yankees game, plan on arriving early and consider leaving your bags at home to help speed up the security screening process,” the Secret Service posed on X.

That followed the Yankees saying earlier that ticketholders “are strongly urged to arrive as early as possible.”

Gates are opening more than three hours before first pitch between the Yankees and Tigers in the Bronx at 7:05 p.m. ET.

Trump is attending to help mark the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.

His attendance at the U.S. Open last weekend in New York sparked very long security lines.

Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a friend of Kirk, said his death “hits particularly hard.”

Lee, a Republican, said he talked his fellow conservative “very regularly, sometimes several times a day.”

Their last text exchange was a short time before Kirk's death, Lee said at a hearing Thursday of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Lee is the panel's chairman.

Lee said the shooting also “hits home particularly heavy with me” because it occurred at Utah Valley University, a few miles from where he grew up and near where he now lives.

Lee said he's attended event at the school since he was a teenager. “And this is a safe place. Not the kind of place where you expect something like this to happen. It's truly tragic.”

The New York Yankees say ticketholders “are strongly urged to arrive as early as possible” due to extra security measure as the president attends tonight's game in the Bronx.

The team said in a statement that gates open at 4 p.m., more than three hours before first pitch against the Detroit Tigers.

It added that fans should also “budget extra time for entry due to enhanced security measures” at all Yankee Stadium gates.

Trump is attending the game to help mark the 24th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.

His visit to the men's final of the U.S. Open in Queens on Sunday sparked massive lines, long enough that some fans didn't make it to their seats for more than an hour into the match — despite organizers delaying the start by 30 minutes.

Trump is scheduled to fly to New York to attend Thursday night's Yankees-Detroit Tigers baseball game at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.

It will be the latest of many sporting events the president has attended this year, including the Super Bowl and the Daytona 500.

“They have a virtual manhunt out there. So we'll see what happens,” Trump said in a brief exchange with reporters shortly after attending the a 9/11 memorial ceremony at the Pentagon. “We hope we get ‘em.”

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for unity Thursday after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at an event in Utah on Wednesday.

“The first reaction of everybody — everybody — should be to say, this is a horrible thing, we ought to come together and to not seek political advantage from it,” Schumer said at a news conference after a meeting with Jeffries over the upcoming spending deadline.

Schumer said political violence is an “affliction” in the United States.

Jeffries said the shooting “should be denounced by everyone, and moving forward, we have to figure out a better way to come together, not as Democrats or Republicans but as Americans.”

The wreath, laid by the president and first lady, was in remembrance of the 184 service members and civilians who were killed 24 years ago at the Pentagon.

Both also signed a guest book.

House and Senate Democrats met Thursday morning to discuss government spending and said afterward that they'll push for improvements to health care in exchange for keeping the government open.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York, said after the meeting that they are united as the Sept. 30 funding deadline approaches.

They didn't detail their specific demands from Republicans, but they've been pushing for an extension of heath care tax credits that will expire at the end of the year and for Republicans to undo cuts to Medicaid in their tax and spending cuts legislation enacted earlier this year.

If Republicans don't engage in bipartisan negotiations, “they ‘ain't going to get the votes,” Schumer told reporters.

The Pentagon chief, who spoke before Trump at Thursday's Pentagon ceremony, remembered the conservative activist as an “American patriot.”

“Charlie, we love you,” Hegseth said. “Know that you have heard the Lord's words. Well done, good and faithful servant. Full heart, clear eyes, like those on 9/11, you will never be forgotten.”

“We will defend the nation they served, the values they upheld and the freedom for which they died,” he said. “We will support our troops, we will protect our families, and we will preserve the American way of life for every future generation.

“We will build taller, grow stronger, fight harder and soar higher, and together we will go forward as one people with one heart, one faith, one flag and one glorious destiny under almighty God,” Trump said.

The Pentagon's 9/11 observance ceremony, which has traditionally been held near the building's memorial outside its walls, was moved into the internal courtyard late Wednesday night.

Defense officials acknowledged the move at the event featuring President Trump but deferred questions about what drove the move to the White House. It came hours after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at an outdoor event at a Utah university. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Marking the solemn 24th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, President Donald Trump announced he will posthumously award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was shot and killed Wednesday afternoon at a Utah college event.

Trump said he remained shocked by horror of Charlie Kirk's assassination during an appearance on Utah college campus and praised his ally's impact on conservative politics.

“Charlie was a giant of his generation, a champion of liberty and an inspiration to millions and millions of people,” Trump said.

“Today, as one nation, we renew our sacred vow that we will never forget Sept. 11, 2001,” the president said.

He recounted moments from that day, including snippets of conversations from passengers who were aboard the hijacked airplanes.

Hegseth was speaking at the Pentagon ceremony and says he was a college junior who had just joined the ROTC program at the time of the attack.

It's his first time addressing the annual observance in his new role.

Hegseth says the attack was the “ultimate validator to serve.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson said Thursday that security is “a big concern” for members of Congress and is under “a very thorough review.”

But Johnson told reporters at the U.S. Capitol that he'd seen security estimates into the billions of dollars for all 435 House members, which he said is “not a possibility.” He did mention a pilot program through which members can be reimbursed for hiring private security when they're on the road or in their districts.

“Somebody who's arguing the other side of an issue is not your enemy, they're your fellow American,” Johnson said, in a call for civility. “We're all made in God's image and so we need to see one another that way and not as enemies.”

After each of the victims' name was announced, a bell was rung.

A federal judge has blocked Trump administration restrictions on services for immigrants in the country illegally, including the federal preschool program Head Start, health clinics and adult education.

The order Wednesday from the judge in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island applies to 20 states and the District of Columbia, whose attorneys general, all Democrats, sued the administration. It puts the administration's reinterpretation of a Clinton-era federal policy on hold while the case is decided.

Under the proposed changes, some community-level programs would be reclassified as federal public benefits, making them inaccessible to people without legal status. Individual public benefits, such as food stamps and college financial aid, have been largely unavailable to people in the country without legal status.

U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy, who was appointed by Trump in 2019, said in her order that the policy rollout was “rushed” in a way that would worsen the impact for people cut off from community services and those tasked with verifying eligibility.

The president was accompanied by first lady Melania Trump.

The appearance is Trump's first in public since the fatal shooting Wednesday in Utah of Charlie Kirk, an ally and supporter of the president.

At 9:37 a.m. on Sept. 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, killing 184 service members and civilians.

Harvard University says it has started receiving notices that many federal grants terminated by the Trump administration will be reinstated after a federal judge ruled the cuts were illegal.

It's an early signal that federal research funding could start flowing to Harvard after months of deadlock with the White House, but it's yet to be seen if money will arrive before the government appeals the judge's decision. So far, no payments have been received, though Harvard is “monitoring funding receipts closely,” spokesperson Jason Newton said.

A federal judge in Boston last week ordered the government to reverse more than $2.6 billion in cuts, saying they were unconstitutional and “used antisemitism as a smokescreen” for an ideological attack. The White House said it will appeal.

It's the latest sign that the labor market is softening.

The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits for the week ending Sept. 6 rose 27,000 to 263,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That's the most filings since the week of Oct. 23, 2021 and well above the 231,000 new applications economists forecast.

Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs and have mostly settled in a historically low range between 200,000 and 250,000 since the U.S. began to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic nearly four years ago.

The four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 9,750 to 240,500.

The total number of Americans collecting unemployment benefits for the previous week of Aug. 30 was unchanged at 1.94 million.

(Lothar Speer via AP)



Opening statements are set to begin Thursday morning for the trial of a man charged with trying to assassinate President Donald Trump while he played golf in South Florida last year, when he was campaigning for a second term.

Ryan Routh is representing himself after U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon agreed to let him dismiss his court-appointed attorneys. They are, however, standing by in the courtroom if needed.

He's pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations.

The FBI released photos of a person of interest in the shooting of Charlie Kirk as investigators are appealing to the public for tips.

The suspect is believed to have jumped off a roof and fled into a neighborhood after firing one shot and has not yet been identified, authorities said Thursday. Previously they've announced they recovered a high-powered rifle that may have been used in the deadly attack.

The circumstances of the shooting drew renewed attention to an escalating threat of political violence in the United States that, in the last several years, has cut across the ideological spectrum. The assassination drew bipartisan condemnation, but a national reckoning over ways to prevent political grievances from manifesting as deadly violence seemed elusive.

Here's what we know so far:



White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles says the messages and calls to the president were from European and Asian leaders expressing condolences about Kirk.

“Charlie was very much a part of this family and maybe the highest profile MAGA person outside of those that are working here,” Wiles said Thursday in an interview on the radio show hosted by Republican strategist Scott Jennings.

“I think it shook everybody to their core,” she added.

Posthumously posting under Kirk's X handle, the organization he founded remembered Kirk on Thursday as “a leader, a mentor, and a friend.”

The post's authors also noted that Kirk was “no stranger to threats,” receiving “thousands of them throughout his life.”

Alongside the post appeared a black and white image of Kirk walking onstage at a Turning Point event, with the lights and pyrotechnics that have become the organization's trademark.

Prior to Thursday's post, Kirk's final X message had been several hours before he was shot Wednesday, concerning the stabbing death of a young Ukrainian refugee on a Charlotte, North Carolina, commuter train last month.

A bomb threat at the DNC headquarters was determined to be not credible, according to a statement from a DNC spokesperson.

U.S. Capitol Police said after being alerted to the threat, they did not find anything outside of the building. Out of an abundance of caution, they were checking the interior of the building.

“As DNC Chair Ken Martin has said, political violence in every form has no place in our country,” the DNC statement said.

U.S. Capitol Police are responding to a bomb threat at Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, according to a person familiar with the incident who requested anonymity because the situation is fluid.

An email sent to Senate offices said that “staff are asked to remain clear of the police activity” and said more information would be forthcoming.

There was no additional information immediately available.

Less than an hour ahead of a planned news conference, the Utah Department of Public Safety called off the 2:45 p.m. ET (12:45 p.m. MT) event, citing “rapid developments in our investigation.”

Authorities said they would release an updated time later Thursday.

A search for the suspect in Kirk's killing was ongoing and authorities have released images of a person of interest, as well as offered a reward for information and solicited help from the public.

The assassination offers the latest example of how ordinary security measures can be defeated in an era of escalating political violence, when anyone associated with the political process is a potential target, including influencers.

Kirk was in a familiar setting Wednesday before a large crowd at a university in Utah, a red state where voting trends largely aligned with his pro-MAGA politics. The conservative firebrand appeared with his own security team, as he has at scores of events on other campuses.

In hindsight, those with experience protecting high-profile public officials and dignitaries say more could have been done to prevent the fatal shooting.

Security experts interviewed by The Associated Press questioned whether the event was sufficiently staffed but also acknowledged the limitations of both campus police forces and outdoor venues. They said only the inner ring closest to Kirk appeared to be secure, leaving the outer and middle rings exposed.

At 2:45 p.m. ET (12:45 p.m. MT), officials in Utah are planning to give another update in their investigation into Kirk's fatal shooting at Utah Valley University.

Earlier Thursday, state and federal officials gave details about a potential suspect and said they had video footage of the person. In the hours since, the FBI has released photos of a “person of interest” and a link to an online form where people can upload photos and video that could potentially be helpful to authorities.

The FBI also announced a $100,000 reward in exchange for information leading to identification of the shooter.

Elected officials and activists across the political spectrum are canceling their speaking engagements this week, citing concerns of political violence.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the nation's most prominent progressive voices, has postponed her visit to Raleigh, North Carolina, where she was scheduled to attend a rally with state Democrats on Sunday. She said the cancellation was because of security concerns.

“The scourge of gun violence and political violence must end,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the latest incident of this chaos and it must stop. We cannot go down this road.”

Ben Shapiro, a conservative influencer and political commentator who drew a similar audience to Kirk, canceled a book signing at the Ronald Reagan Presidential and other speaking engagements on his public calendar immediately following the shooting. Shapiro said in a post on X that he was “utterly stunned and heartbroken and sick to my soul” to learn of Kirk's death.

That's according to a source with knowledge of the planning but not authorized to speak publicly about them.

Vance shuffled his schedule Thursday, nixing plans to attend a Sept. 11 commemoration in New York City and heading instead to Utah, where Kirk, his friend, was assassinated Wednesday.

While in Utah, Vance and his wife, Usha, were to meet with Kirk's family and close friends, the person with knowledge told the AP.

Afterward, Vance will fly Kirk's casket and family with him aboard Air Force Two from Utah to Arizona, where Kirk made his home.

Temporary flight restrictions were issued earlier Thursday for both areas, indicated movements of a high-profile person, like Vance.

“We're just here as a group to say America cannot govern itself this way,” GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham said to open a news conference Thursday, flanked by a mix of Democratic and Republican senators.

GOP Sen. Katie Britt said Kirk has influenced many people, including her children.

“Talking through this with them last night is just unthinkable,” said an emotional Britt. “The time for unity, the time for peace, it is now.”

The news conference was to highlight a bipartisan push to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism and included Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Amy Klobuchar.

Klobuchar highlighted multiple shootings that had happened in her own state of Minnesota this year, including the killing of a top Democratic state lawmaker.

“It has to end. And we have to join together, to condemn it,” Klobuchar said.

The FBI says it's offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the identification and arrest of whoever is responsible for Kirk's death.

Anyone with information is asked to call 1-800-CALL-FBI. Officials also published the link for a form where people can upload videos and photos.

Earlier Thursday, law enforcement officials disseminated two photos, seeking the public's help in identifying the “person of interest.”

Dowd had said on-air that Kirk had made incendiary statements, and that “hateful words” can lead to “hateful actions.” Dowd later apologized, saying he in no way meant to imply Kirk was responsible for the attack, but the damage had been done. MSNBC President Rebecca Kutler said the remarks were inappropriate and insensitive. 

Meanwhile, a reporter for Floridapolitics.com was suspended for texting a congressman a question about gun control very shortly after Wednesday's attack. Publisher Peter Schorsch said the timing was inappropriate.

The once bustling halls and classrooms of Utah Valley University sat silent Thursday, save for some university staff and law enforcement guarding police tape in the hot sun. 

Television and newspaper reporters were set up for press conferences in the building just off the shooting site, but police officers guarded most views of the amphitheater, shaped like baseball's home plate, where Kirk had been speaking and taking questions from an audience of thousands the day before.

The agency released two photos of a ‘person of interest' in connection with the shooting of Charlie Kirk as investigators appeal to the public for information. The photos show a person wearing a hat, sunglasses and a long sleeve black shirt.

Law enforcement recovered a Mauser .30 caliber bolt-action rifle hidden in a towel in a wooded area near the university campus along what they suspect to be the shooter's path as they fled the scene, according to information circulated among law enforcement and shared with The Associated Press. 

In addition to the spent cartridge recovered in the chamber, three other rounds were loaded in the magazine. The weapon and ammunition are now being forensically analyzed by law enforcement at a federal lab for clues that could help identify the shooter or their motive.

Some attendees who bolted after the gunshot rushed into two classrooms full of students, where the periodic table adorned the wall and formulas were written in blue on the whiteboard. They pulled tables from the center of the room to barricade the door, stacking them atop each other. Others were turned on their side in a corner for a last ditch defense. 

Desperate, someone grabbed an electric pencil sharpener and wrapped the cord tightly around the door handle, then tied the sharpener to a chair leg.

Thursday morning, the classrooms were quiet and in disarray. Backpacks and notebooks were left on the desks, some scribbled with notes on electromotive force in green pen and pink highlighter.

The president said he plans to speak with Kirk's family on Thursday afternoon.

Trump made those remarks in a brief conversation with reporters as he left the Pentagon.

Vice President JD Vance is traveling to Utah Thursday to meet with Kirk's family in person.

The former Wisconsin governor, now president of the foundation, said his group will continue to hold events on college campuses to attract young people to the Republican Party. But they cancelled a Thursday night event in Santa Barbara featuring conservative commentator Ben Shapiro out of respect for Kirk and his family, Walker said.

“We will review our security measures to ensure the safety of our students, speakers, and staff,” Walker said in a statement on the group's website. “This will likely mean that we will change venues and security measures for many of our events. But we will not stop. Doing so would mean that the evil assassin who did this wins. He must not win. The best way to honor Charlie's life is to continue his work.”

The Florida Republican honored Kirk and called for nonviolent political participation as he marked 24 years since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks at an event in Palm Harbor on Thursday.

“The viability of a republic really depends on our ability to fight those battles in the proper arena, leading into voting, leading into debate,” DeSantis said. “It is certainly not that you kill somebody in order to silence them.”

Students at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton plan to gather Thursday evening to honor Kirk, holding a memorial service and prayer vigil at the student union on the Palm Beach County campus. “May he rest in Peace,” the FAU Turning Point USA chapter posted on its Instagram account. “Security will be present.”

The Republican said the death of his friend “hits particularly hard.” Lee said he talked with his fellow conservative “very regularly, sometimes several times a day.”

Their last text exchange was a short time before Kirk's death, Lee said at a hearing Thursday of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Lee is the panel's chairman.

Lee said the shooting also “hits home particularly heavy with me” because Utah Valley University is just a few miles from where he grew up and near where he now lives. He's attended events there since he was a teenager. 

“And this is a safe place. Not the kind of place where you expect something like this to happen. It's truly tragic.”

Utah is one of 14 states that allow some level of concealed carry of firearms on public college and university campuses. The other 13 include Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. The remaining 36 states allow colleges and universities to keep concealed firearms off campus, according to the anti-violence organization Everytown for Gun Safety.

In May, after action by the Utah legislature, a law took affect that allows anyone at least 18 years old with a valid Utah concealed weapon permit to carry a weapon on campus, including in an “open” fashion. Prior to the passage and the signing of H.B. 128, the firearm had to have been concealed. 

The State Department is warning foreign visa applicants and holders that they could be denied a U.S. visa or deported if they praise or make light of Kirk's assassination.

In an unusual post to X, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said he's personally disgusted by some posts he's seen, and that consular officials have been directed “to undertake appropriate action.”

“In light of yesterday's horrific assassination of a leading political figure, I want to underscore that foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,” Landau said. He asked social media users to copy him on any posts they see that could be relevant.

Earlier this year, Landau announced that he had revoked visas for British punk-rap performer Bob Vylan and his crew after they led crowds in chanting “death” to the Israeli military.

The Senate Democratic leader called for the condemnation of political violence following Kirk's “heinous murder.”

He also asked on the Senate floor for prayers for Kirk's family. 

“There should be no finger pointing because this is an attack on our democracy itself,” Schumer said.

Saying the attack on Kirk was “heinous, cowardly and would make everyone sick to their stomachs,” Schumer also decried the 2017 shooting that wounded current House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and “the politically motivated murders” of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband this year.

Schumer also mentioned a shooting at a suburban Denver high school on Wednesday, in which two students were reportedly injured.

Investigators are confident they will find the shooter, said Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason.

They now have images of a suspect and were analyzing a palm print and a shoe impression found near the scene, he said. 

Authorities aren't planning to release images of the suspect unless they need the public's help, Mason said.

Two other people initially detained turned out to be uninvolved and were released. Unfortunately, they've been getting death threats, Mason said: “They don't deserve that.” 

Thursday morning, the canopy tent Kirk was shot under stood disheveled in the morning light, still stamped with the words “PROVE ME WRONG,” a slogan commonly used at Kirk's events. 

Beyond it, the amphitheater seats were strewn with bags and belongings left in the attendees' mad rush to escape. 

Investigators picked through the scene, snapping photos and carrying boxes as they ducked back and forth under crime tape.

“They have a virtual manhunt out there. So we'll see what happens,” Trump said in a brief exchange with reporters shortly after attending the a 9/11 memorial ceremony at the Pentagon. “We hope we get ‘em.”

A batch of 911 traffic released Thursday from the Utah County Department of Public Safety via Broadcastify includes callers describing seeing a person on campus wearing “jeans, black shirt, black mask” and carrying a “long rifle.”

Another caller mentions a black vest.

During a news conference on Thursday, law enforcement officials said they had obtained video footage of a suspected shooter and had recovered a high-powered, bolt-action rifle from the wooded area where the suspect fled.

Authorities also said the shooter “appeared to be of college age” and “blended in” with students on the campus.

The Pentagon chief, who spoke before Trump at Thursday's Pentagon ceremony, remembered the conservative activist as an “American patriot.”

“Charlie, we love you,” Hegseth said. “Know that you have heard the Lord's words. Well done, good and faithful servant. Full heart, clear eyes, like those on 9/11, you will never be forgotten.”

At the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said “all Americans should come together and feel and mourn what happened.”

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said this was a moment for Americans to unite “not as Democrats or Republicans, as Blacks or Whites or Latinos or Asians but as Americans. We need to come together as Americans.”

The leaders spoke to reporters after a bicameral Democratic legislative meeting.

The Pentagon's 9/11 observance ceremony, which has traditionally been held near the building's memorial outside its walls, was moved into the internal courtyard late Wednesday night.

Defense officials acknowledged the move at the event featuring Trump, but deferred questions to the White House. 

It came hours after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at an outdoor event at a Utah university. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

During remarks at the Pentagon, Trump said he would posthumously award Kirk with the honor at a later date.

The United States' highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom is awarded by presidents to people who have made significant contributions in a variety of areas, including culture and public service.

In his first term, Trump bestowed the honor to a number of people, including conservative firebrand commentator Rush Limbaugh.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said Thursday that security is “a big concern” for members of Congress and is under “a very thorough review.”

But Johnson told reporters at the U.S. Capitol that he had seen security estimates into the billions of dollars for all 435 House members, which he said is “not a possibility.” 

He did mention a pilot program through which members can be reimbursed for hiring private security when they're on the road or in their districts.

“Somebody who's arguing the other side of an issue is not your enemy, they're your fellow American,” Johnson said, in a call for civility. “We're all made in God's image and so we need to see one another that way and not as enemies.”

The person who fatally shot Kirk is believed to have targeted him at an event on a Utah college campus, said Robert Bohls, the FBI Special Agent in Charge at the Salt Lake City field office.

The shooter is still on the run, and it isn't clear how far the suspect may have gotten, but the nearby woods have been secured, authorities said.

Law enforcement officials said the suspect they are seeking “appears to be of college age” and “blended in” with students on the college campus.

Officials asked the public to share any video and images they may have to help identify the person. Authorities said they have video footage of the suspected shooter but did not confirm that includes images of the person's face.

Authorities found what they believe was the murder weapon, a high powered bolt-action rifle, in a wooded area where the shooter fled, said FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert Bohls.

Mason said authorities tracked the suspected shooter's movements after he jumped from a building, moved through stairwells and ultimately fled from campus into a neighborhood.

“We do have good video of this individual,” Mason said.

Law enforcement officials have begun their news conference at Utah Valley University.

Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason says officials will work Thursday to release Kirk's body from the medical examiner to his family.

Law enforcement officials in Utah are holding a news conference Thursday morning to share updates in their investigation.

The Utah Department of Public Safety says its commissioner, as well as the FBI special agent in charge, will speak to reporters at 9 a.m. ET on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem.

The news conference will be streamed on the department's Instagram page.

In a video message from the Oval Office late Wednesday, President Donald Trump called Kirk “a martyr for truth and freedom” and condemned the “demonizing” of political opponents in the U.S.



Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, are set to visit with Kirk's family on Thursday in Salt Lake City.

According to a person familiar with Vance's plans, but not authorized to speak about them publicly, the Vances will visit Utah instead of New York, which had been their planned destination for an outdoor ceremony to commemorate Sept. 11.

Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot has the latest on the Middle East conflict on 'America's Newsroom.' 

The White House issued a rare public rebuke of Israel for its strikes on Hamas leaders in Qatar, putting Washington in an awkward position between two key allies.

The Trump administration almost never breaks publicly with Israel on military campaigns. But analysts say the deeper question is how much the U.S. knew in advance and whether it quietly offered its blessing.

Hamas said the strike killed five of its members but failed to assassinate the group's negotiating delegation. A Qatari security official also died, underscoring the risk of escalation when Israeli operations spill into the territory of U.S. partners.

"There's a lot of opaqueness when it comes to exactly what the United States knew and when," said Daniel Benaim, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. "But the president has been pretty clear that he was unhappy with the substance and the process of what happened yesterday. This kind of public statement by a U.S. president in the wake of a strike like this is already very notable in its own right."

ISRAELI STRIKE TARGETS HAMAS LEADERSHIP IN QATAR

Just days before the strike, Trump issued what he called a "last warning" to Hamas, urging the group to accept a U.S.-backed proposal to release hostages from Gaza. The timing has fueled speculation about whether the strike was connected to Washington's frustration with Hamas and whether Israel acted with at least tacit U.S. approval.

"It just seems like the Israelis wouldn't have done this without him knowing," said Michael Makovsky, CEO of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America. 

"They've got a U.S. base right in that country with everything going on with the hostage talks. I got a sense that he knew, and it's hard to understand exactly what happened — that if he knew, he sat on it, and then he told the Qataris only when the missiles were flying."

But Trump had harsh words about the strike Tuesday, writing on Truth Social that it "does not advance Israel or America's goals."

The White House claimed it learned from the U.S. military that missiles were on the move and gave warning to the Qataris. Qatar has denied getting any sort of advanced warning. 

If Washington knew in advance, why issue the rebuke? If it didn't, how could Israel act so freely in airspace dominated by the U.S. military? Either option raises uncomfortable questions about America's leverage.

QATAR THREATENS TO 'RETALIATE' AGAINST ISRAEL FOR DOHA STRIKE ON HAMAS

"Israel would not do what it did without some sort of an approval by the U.S.," said Dr. Yoel Guzansky, senior researcher and head of the Gulf program at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies. "The Trump administration wants to distance itself, and it's understandable, because it has good relations with the Qataris."

That relationship is anchored in hard power. The U.S.'s biggest overseas air base, Al Udeid, sits on Qatari soil and hosts more than 10,000 American troops. Qatar is a top buyer of U.S. weapons and recently gave the administration a new Air Force One jet. Yet none of that deterred Israel's strike. 

"If indeed the U.S. wasn't aware, then we have a big problem, because Israel surprised the U.S., and it might cause damage to U.S.-Qatari relations," Guzansky said.

Others argue the U.S. may have been more aligned with the operation than its rhetoric suggests. 

"The fact that U.S. defenses at Al Udeid were not used against Israeli jets is a great indicator that Washington was not opposed to the strike," Ahmad Sharawi, a researcher at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. 

But Qatar's international Media Office called claims that Qatar was reevaluating its security partnership with the U.S. "categorically false." 

"It is a clear and failed attempt to drive a wedge between Qatar and the U.S."

The reverberations extend beyond Washington and Doha. The strikes risk unsettling the delicate outreach between Israel, the U.S. and Gulf states, particularly Saudi Arabia, which has been under quiet but sustained pressure to join the Abraham Accords, the U.S.-brokered normalization deals between Israel and Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates.

"Regional power dynamics are shifting," said Benaim. "Gulf states are a bit less concerned about the threat from Iran, which was pushing them closer to Israel, and they're seeing that Israel is engaged in activities across the region, whether it's Syria or inside Iran or now inside Doha."

ISRAEL'S DOHA STRIKE SENT A DECISIVE MESSAGE THAT TERROR WILL FIND NO SAFE HAVEN

The divergence is stark. Gulf leaders want de-escalation and stability to rebrand their states as hubs of investment, tourism and economic recovery. Israel, meanwhile, is pursuing a strategy of direct confrontation with Iran across multiple fronts.

"Gulf states that are really focused on their own economic recovery don't like the image of smoldering, smoking Gulf cities subject to bombs because they're trying to attract investment and create an image of common stability," Benaim said.

That mismatch could slow normalization, even if it doesn't derail it. 

"Israel is probably underestimating the power of Gulf solidarity and the barrier being crossed when you see Israel striking inside of a GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] state," one former senior State Department official added. "I don't think that means their relationships are going to fall apart or unravel, but these things cast a long shadow."

Sharawi counters that Gulf outrage may be less about Israel itself than about the precedent of a strike on GCC soil. 

"It was an Israeli action against a fellow GCC partner despite the hostile relationship that countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE had with Qatar in the past," he said. "But Gulf leaders are also deeply critical of Qatar for hosting Hamas. Privately, many will understand why Israel acted, even if publicly they condemn it."

For Qatar, the strikes open up both a vulnerability and an opportunity. On the one hand, it cannot allow itself to appear passive in the face of foreign attacks on its soil. Analysts expect Doha to respond through diplomatic channels, critical media coverage and perhaps limited economic measures against Israel.

But Qatar also has a long history of turning crisis into relevance. 

"Qataris want to be again the mediator, because they earn a lot of points internationally — especially from the U.S.," said Guzansky. "It's in their DNA."

That means Qatar's public outrage may coexist with a return to shuttle diplomacy, positioning itself once more as indispensable to ceasefire negotiations.

Sharawi argues that Qatar's victim narrative also obscures its complicity. 

"The leadership of a terrorist organization has failed to bring in a sustainable ceasefire, and Qatar has empowered Hamas by hosting them," he said. "Even though Gulf leaders won't say it publicly, they are very anti-Hamas. That context matters for how normalization prospects are viewed after this strike."

Earlier this week Fox News' Brian Kilmeade told a Qatari spokesperson it sounded more like the nation was "taking Hamas' side" than playing mediator. 

"When one of the parties decides to attack our sovereignty in a residential neighborhood where my countrymen, the residents of Qatar, live in schools and nurseries right next door, believe me, it's very difficult to maintain a very calm voice," foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al Ansari said.

The Doha strikes also highlight an asymmetry in Gulf reactions. When Iran struck Al Udeid Air Base earlier this year, Gulf solidarity with Qatar was muted. This time, condemnations poured in minute by minute.

"You didn't see Gulf leaders coming and hugging the Qataris after Iran's strike," Guzansky noted. "But with Israel, the reaction was much louder, with strong rhetoric across the Arab world."

Sharawi agrees but frames it differently. 

"They were overly critical of Israel compared to Iran," Sharawi said. "The Jordanian king even said Qatar's security is Jordan's security, a very strong statement. The Arabs don't hesitate to latch onto anything that criticizes Israel, and that showed yesterday, even in comparison with Iran."

The contrast underscores a regional reality. Gulf leaders fear escalation with Tehran, but criticizing Israel carries little risk. For Qatar, the difference offers a chance to rally sympathy and spotlight its sovereignty — even as its neighbors quietly question its choice to host Hamas.

Israel's military reach is undeniable. But by striking inside Doha, it may have paid a hidden diplomatic price, reinforcing perceptions of Israel as a destabilizing actor at a time when Gulf states seek calm.

The fact that Hamas leaders survived while a Qatari security official was killed may further complicate the fallout, heightening anger in Doha while leaving Israel's core objective incomplete.

Will Cain breaks down the top stories, including how a Texas A&M professor was fired for pushing gender ideology. Plus, Kurt Schlichter joins Will to expose the lies of 2020 and why soft-on-crime policies fueled the Charlotte murder.

Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles offered no comment on President Donald Trump's call to enforce the death penalty against Decarlos Brown Jr., the suspect accused of an unprovoked fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a light-rail line.

"The animal who so violently killed the beautiful young lady from Ukraine, who came to America searching for peace and safety, should be given a ‘Quick' (there is no doubt!) Trial, and only awarded the death penalty. There can be no other option!!!" Trump wrote on Truth Social after Brown's capture.

Lyles' office provided Fox News Digital a lengthy statement from the mayor highlighting the importance of proper transit safety, among other concerns, but declined to comment directly on Trump's demand.

"The city has always partnered well with the Federal Transit Authority, including earlier this year for CATS' (the transit system) triennial review which was successfully completed," Lyles said.

"We respect the FTA's role and will take this opportunity to work with them to review how we provide safe service to our community."

"We are ready and willing to work with state and federal partners to make our community better and safer."

Lyles, a Democrat, said she will continue to look for bipartisan solutions to pressing problems like transit safety as mayor of North Carolina's largest city.

She added that CATS made several changes since the attack, including increased security on the Blue Line, which runs from UNC-Charlotte in the north to Pineville, near the South Carolina state line in the south. Zarutska was killed on the Blue Line.

"CATS will also deploy new security teams, including bike patrols and urban terrain vehicles in the coming weeks. Nearly 30 additional security personnel will also be added," Lyles said.

After Brown allegedly killed Ukrainian refugee Zarutska, he complained to his sister that he "hurt [his] hand" stabbing her before asking rhetorically why anyone would "stab somebody for no reason."

Brown also said it was the "material used in [his] body" that committed the crime and that the "material" should be investigated because "you know that's not me." 

His sister later added that the woman who was killed was from Ukraine or Russia and cited what she called a "war going on against the United States."

North Carolina still has the death penalty on the books but has been under a de facto moratorium since its last execution in 2006 amid legal fights over alleged bias and pharmaceuticals used in lethal injections.

Fox News' Eric Shawn reports on the staggering rise in 9/11-linked cancer diagnoses from Ground Zero, including his own recent diagnosis from covering the terrorist attacks 24 years ago.

On the 24th anniversary of the Sept. 11th attacks, Fox News correspondent Eric Shawn reported live on Fox & Friends from Lower Manhattan, where survivors, families, first responders and public officials gathered to honor the nearly 3,000 lives lost. 

During the segment, Shawn revealed he himself suffers from 9/11-related cancer.

"I have two different diagnoses under the World Trade Center Program," he revealed, referencing the federal program that provides monitoring and treatment for survivors, responders and others directly affected in New York, at the Pentagon and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

"It is hard to believe that it has been nearly a quarter of a century since that day, when radical Islamic terrorism attacked the very heart of our city and our country," Shawn said.

"It is a philosophy that basically hates our principles, our freedoms, what our nation stands for. That has not diminished — and today, again, we all gather here to remember what was lost."

The tragedy extends far beyond that day, he emphasized.

"While 2,977 people were murdered here that day, the number who have died from 9/11-related illnesses has increased from the toxic dust that was released," Shawn said.

 "We're all in this together."

According to CDC data, 48,000 people have now reported 9/11-related cancers, with nearly 10,000 diagnoses in just the past year.

More than 3,700 first responders have died since 9/11, including 2,300 who had cancer. The Fire Department of the City of New York has been hit especially hard, with 409 of its members lost to post-9/11 illnesses.

For Shawn, the statistics are deeply personal, as he suffers from both respiratory issues and cancer directly related to the attacks. But, he says, he is one of the lucky ones.

"I think of all those who were killed that day and those who continue to suffer because of that philosophy — that is not diminished. We have to condemn it. We have to despise it. You will never forget."

The health impact reaches far beyond first responders, Shawn said. 

"If you were below Canal Street, basically, you were exposed to the dust. I was here reporting on it. That's what happened with me. I mean, I'm very, very lucky. I think of all those who are suffering much greater … I've lost a few friends from this, of course."

Shawn's own diagnosis came decades later, in the form of a bronchitis-related respiratory issue and then a cancer diagnosis just this year.

"Back then, I remember thinking, maybe in 20, 30 years later I'll get something. Well, here it is, 24 years."

Shawn emphasized the importance of coming together as a nation: "We're all in this together. I mean, we are. We are all in it together."

"I want to be remembered for courage and for my faith… the most important thing in my life is my faith," Charlie Kirk said on a podcast last year.

The Turning Point USA founder died after he was shot Wednesday at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. 

Kirk was a significant figure who inspired hundreds of young students, encouraging them not only in their political interests, but also in leading lives guided by faith.

Pastor Rob McCoy, co-chair of Turning Point Faith in California, told Fox News Digital Wednesday that Kirk called him his pastor, but that he prefers to be known as "his friend and greatest fan."

"My friend Charlie Kirk was murdered today by a coward," said McCoy. "His life will be remembered for many wonderful things — Charlie's life will be remembered for many wonderful things."

"He built it all with the power of the spoken word," said McCoy, who traveled to be with the Kirk family on Wednesday. 

"He never used violence, but was threatened every day with violence by those who couldn't contend with logic and truth — and now they have done to my friend what evil always does. It takes away life."

"Charlie did not die," he continued. "Instead, he has begun to truly live. His life was secured eternally by His Savior, Jesus Christ. This truth allowed Charlie to face every threat with courage, because he didn't fear death."

McCoy added, "All evil knows is death, and they derive power from death. Charlie lived for life and will be remembered for this. My heart is broken for his family — his wife Erika and his two precious children. Evil has not prevailed, and it will not win."

In the wake of the shocking assassination, Rev. Franklin Graham, one of the nation's most prominent Christian voices, told Fox News Digital that "America is mourning the loss of Charlie Kirk."

"Our hearts break for his wife and family. He loved this country, loved God and loved his family. He was a gifted and courageous communicator of truth. Even more importantly, Charlie Kirk was a passionate follower of the Lord Jesus Christ," said Graham. 

"Evil has not prevailed, and it will not win."

Graham, who is the president and CEO of Samaritan's Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, shared that he is appreciative of the work Kirk did to encourage, engage and inform young college students across the nation.

"His voice will be greatly missed, but I pray that God will raise up an army of young men and women like him who will stand up for the same important issues," he said.

Graham added that Kirk lived boldly for Jesus Christ, who said, "'I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though He may die, He shall live. And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die.'"

Canada-based Christian minister Rick Pearson, host of ProphecyUSA, shared that Kirk was a "voice of biblical clarity in a nation that has lost its way."

"He took bold stands to present truth and restore moral clarity. People have asked if Charlie was an American martyr. Yes, absolutely," he told Fox News Digital.

Pearson added, "The person who pulled the trigger carried the spirit of Babylon, Baal worship, murder and hatred. Charlie warred against those spirits with wisdom, compassion and gentleness. He will be greatly missed."

Sheri Few, president and founder of United States Parents Involved in Education, shared that the assassination marks a sad time for young Americans on college campuses. 

"He took bold stands to present truth and restore moral clarity."

"It is no secret that government schools indoctrinate children, pitting them against one another with pedagogies rooted in Marxist theory," said Few, based in South Carolina.

"When you teach children to hate themselves and others and to become social justice warriors at all costs, you should not be surprised when heart-wrenching tragedies like this occur."

Tim Clinton, the Virginia-based president of the American Association of Christian Counselors and executive director of the Center for Human Flourishing at Liberty University, described Kirk as a "loving husband and tremendous father."

"His unwavering faith, deep love for God and profound patriotism inspired all who knew him," Clinton told Fox News Digital. "He loved this country and lived his life with purpose and conviction — standing strong for righteousness in culture."

He shared that Kirk made him a better man — and that he's grateful to have called him a friend.

"As we honor Charlie's life, let us rise to our better selves, work to end senseless violence and remain steadfast in the values that truly matter — faith, family, love and unity," Clinton added.

Diane Ferraro, CEO of Save the Storks, told Fox News Digital that Kirk was a bold voice for the voiceless. 

"He shared the truth about the reality of abortion with the younger generations, and he will forever be a hero to me. We are praying fervently for his beautiful wife and precious children," Ferraro told Fox News Digital.

Walker Wildmon, VP at the American Family Association and CEO of AFA Action in Mississippi, said the assassination marks a sad time for the state of political discourse.  

"[Democrats have] been accusing ideological conservatives of being a ‘threat to democracy' for years," Wildmon told Fox News Digital.

He added, "There is a militant element to the Democrat Party that is doing as they've been told and ‘taking to the streets' to punish their ideological enemies. There is a continual civil war being waged against conservative voters and leaders."

Christian speaker and author Alex McFarland told Fox News Digital that Christians must continue to speak truth instead of going silent.

"His unwavering faith, deep love for God and profound patriotism inspired all who knew him."

"Our Christian brother and fellow patriot, Charlie Kirk, has been murdered. For the rest of us, this indicates how all of our futures hang in the balance," said McFarland, who is based in North Carolina.

"We call on everyone to pray for Charlie's wife, children and our nation, and I call on my fellow clergy to courageously proclaim truth and call out darkness," said McFarland, who is co-host of "Exploring the Word" on the American Family Radio Network.

"We have to stay vocal. The truth will win in the end. In the meantime, we are in a battle — and every single one of us must rise to the moment and speak the truth."

The FBI released photos of what it's calling “a person of interest” in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah college campus Wednesday.

A memorial for Charlie Kirk has been set up outside Turning Point headquarters in Phoenix.

Scenes from inside a classroom at Utah Valley University, where some people rushed after a gunshot struck the conservative activist during an event on campus Thursday.

Law enforcement officials say the sniper who assassinated Kirk has not been identified and is believed to have jumped off a roof and fled into a neighborhood after firing one shot.

OREM, Utah (AP) — The FBI released two photos of a person of interest in the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a close ally of President Donald Trump who played an influential role in rallying young Republican voters. The shooter, who fired a single shot from a distant roof, remained at large and unidentified on Thursday nearly 24 hours into the investigation.

The release of photos of a person in a hat, sunglasses and a long-sleeve black shirt, as well as a $100,000 reward for information leading to an arrest, reflected law enforcement's urgent appeal for public help in locating the shooter, who vanished after jumping off the roof and fleeing through a wooded area near the Utah university where Kirk was killed in a targeted attack.

Investigators were sifting through potential clues, including a palm print and a shoe impression found near the scene, as well as a Mauser .30-caliber bolt-action rifle hidden in a towel in a wooded area near the university campus along what they suspect to be the path the shooter took while fleeing. Besides the spent cartridge recovered in the chamber, three other rounds were loaded in the magazine, according to information circulated among law enforcement and described to The Associated Press. The weapon and ammunition are being forensically analyzed by law enforcement at a federal lab for clues that could help identify the shooter or the motive. 

The new information suggested at least modest progress in an investigation into a killing that law enforcement was treating as the latest instance of political violence to convulse the United States across the ideological spectrum. Yet key questions remained unanswered. Law enforcement had yet to identify the shooter or disclose a motive and acknowledged at a news conference Thursday that the suspect's college-age appearance may have helped the person blend in on the college campus where Kirk was shot. 

The Wednesday afternoon attack, carried out in a broad daylight as Kirk spoke about social issues at a Utah Valley University courtyard, was captured on grisly videos circulating on social media. The videos show Kirk speaking into a handheld microphone when suddenly a shot rings out. Kirk can be seen reaching up with his right hand as blood gushes from the left side of his neck. Stunned spectators gasp and scream before people start running away.

Trump, who was joined by Democrats in condemning the violence, said he would award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the U.S., while Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, were set to visit with Kirk's family in Salt Lake City. Vance posted a remembrance on X chronicling their friendship, dating back to initial messages in 2017, through Vance's Senate run and ultimately praying after hearing of the shooting. 




“So much of the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene,” Vance wrote. “He didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.”

Kirk's casket was to be flown aboard Air Force Two from Utah to Arizona, where his his nonprofit political youth organization, Turning Point USA, is based.

Kirk was speaking at a debate hosted by Turning Point at the Sorensen Center courtyard on campus. 

The event, billed as the first stop on Kirk's “The American Comeback Tour,” had generated a polarizing campus reaction. An online petition calling for university administrators to bar Kirk from appearing received nearly 1,000 signatures. The university issued a statement last week citing First Amendment rights and affirming its “commitment to free speech, intellectual inquiry, and constructive dialogue.”

Last week, Kirk posted on X images of news clips showing his visit was sparking controversy. He wrote, “What's going on in Utah?”

Immediately before the shooting, he took questions from an audience member about gun violence.

“Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?” the person asked. Kirk responded, “Too many.”

The questioner followed up: “Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?”

“Counting or not counting gang violence?” Kirk asked.

Then a shot rang out. 

The shooter, who Gov. Spencer Cox pledged would be held accountable in a state with the death penalty, wore dark clothing and fired from a building roof some distance away.

Madison Lattin was watching a few dozen feet from Kirk's left when she heard the bullet hit him.

“Blood is falling and dripping down, and you're just like so scared, not just for him but your own safety,” she said.

She saw people drop to the ground in an eerie silence pierced immediately by cries. She and others ran. Some fell and were trampled in the stampede.

When Lattin later learned that Kirk had died, she wept, she said, describing him as a role model who had showed her how to fight for the truth.

About 3,000 people were in attendance, according to a statement from the Utah Department of Public Safety. The university police department had six officers working the event, along with Kirk's own security detail, authorities said.

The shooting drew swift bipartisan condemnation as Democratic officials joined Trump and other Republican allies of Kirk in decrying the violence.

“The murder of Charlie Kirk breaks my heart. My deepest sympathies are with his wife, two young children, and friends,” said Gabrielle Giffords, the former Democratic congresswoman who was wounded in a 2011 shooting in her Arizona district.

The shooting appeared poised to become part of a spike of political violence that has touched a range of ideologies and representatives of both major political parties. The attacks include the assassination of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband at their house in June, the firebombing of a Colorado parade in June to demand Hamas release hostages and a fire set at the house of Pennsylvania's governor, who is Jewish, in April. The most notorious of these events is the shooting of Trump during a Pennsylvania campaign rally last year.

Vance, who was acquainted with Kirk, posted a lengthy tribute to the Turning Point USA co-founder on social media hours after his death.

“I was in a meeting in the West Wing when those group chats started lighting up with people telling Charlie they were praying for him,” the vice president wrote on X. “And that's how I learned the news that my friend had been shot. I prayed a lot over the next hour, as first good news and then bad trickled in.”

“God didn't answer those prayers, and that's OK. He had other plans. And now that Charlie is in heaven, I'll ask him to talk to big man directly on behalf of his family, his friends, and the country he loved so dearly,” he continued. “You ran a good race, my friend. We've got it from here.”

President Donald Trump also honored Kirk in numerous messages. On Thursday morning, he announced that Kirk would be awarded a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.

The manhunt remains ongoing for the unidentified gunman responsible for Kirk's death. The FBI asked the public for tips on information regarding his identity and offered a $100,000 cash reward to anyone who could provide information leading to the suspect's arrest.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Help is available if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters. In the US: Call or text 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. Globally: The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide have contact information for crisis centers.



            The Federal Trade Commission has launched an investigation into seven tech companies around potential harms their artificial intelligence chatbots could cause to children and teenagers.
    


            The inquiry focuses on AI chatbots that can serve as companions, which “effectively mimic human characteristics, emotions, and intentions, and generally are designed to communicate like a friend or confidant, which may prompt some users, especially children and teens, to trust and form relationships with chatbots,” the agency said in a statement Thursday.
    


            The FTC sent order letters to Google parent company Alphabet; Character.AI; Instagram and its parent company, Meta; OpenAI; Snap; and Elon Musk's xAI. The agency wants information about whether and how the firms measure the impact of their chatbots on young users and how they protect against and alert parents to potential risks.
    


            The investigation comes amid rising concern around AI use by children and teens, following a string of lawsuits and reports accusing chatbots of being complicit in the suicide deaths, sexual exploitation and other harms to young people. That includes one lawsuit against OpenAI and two against Character.AI that remain ongoing even as the companies say they are continuing to build out additional features to protect users from harmful interactions with their bots.
    


            Broader concerns have also surfaced that even adult users are building unhealthy emotional attachments to AI chatbots, in part because the tools are often designed to be agreeable and supportive.
    


Parental controls are coming to ChatGPT ‘within the next month,' OpenAI says



            At least one online safety advocacy group, Common Sense Media, has argued that AI “companion” apps pose unacceptable risks to children and should not be available to users under the age of 18. Two California state bills related to AI chatbot safety for minors, including one backed by Common Sense Media, are set to receive final votes this week and, if passed, will reach California Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk. The US Senate Judiciary Committee is also set to hold a hearing next week entitled “Examining the Harm of AI Chatbots.”
    


            “As AI technologies evolve, it is important to consider the effects chatbots can have on children, while also ensuring that the United States maintains its role as a global leader in this new and exciting industry,” FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said in the Thursday statement. “The study we're launching today will help us better understand how AI firms are developing their products and the steps they are taking to protect children.”
    


            In particular, the FTC's orders seek information about how the companies monetize user engagement, generate outputs in response to user inquiries, develop and approve AI characters, use or share personal information gained through user conversations and mitigate negative impacts to children, among other details.
    


            Google, Snap and xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
    


            “Our priority is making ChatGPT helpful and safe for everyone, and we know safety matters above all else when young people are involved. We recognize the FTC has open questions and concerns, and we're committed to engaging constructively and responding to them directly,” OpenAI spokesperson Liz Bourgeois said in a statement. She added that OpenAI has safeguards such as notifications directing users to crisis helplines and plans to roll out parental controls for minor users.
    


            After the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine sued OpenAI last month alleging that ChatGPT encouraged their son's death by suicide, the company acknowledged its safeguards may be “less reliable” when users engage in long conversations with the chatbots and said it was working with experts to improve them.
    


            Meta declined to comment directly on the FTC inquiry. The company said it is currently limiting teens' access to only a select group of its AI characters, such as those that help with homework. It is also training its AI chatbots not to respond to teens' mentions of sensitive topics such as self-harm or inappropriate romantic conversations and to instead point to expert resources.
    


            “We look forward to collaborating with the FTC on this inquiry and providing insight on the consumer AI industry and the space's rapidly evolving technology,” Jerry Ruoti, Character.AI's head of trust and safety, said in a statement. He added that the company has invested in trust and safety resources such as a new under-18 experience on the platform, a parental insights tool and disclaimers reminding users that they are chatting with AI.

Vance's candid social media reflection gave a rare glimpse into Kirk's influence — not only on the conservative movement but also on the very formation of the Trump-Vance team.

"Charlie was one of the first people I called when I thought about running for Senate in early 2021," Vance wrote. "We talked through everything, from the strategy to the fundraising to the grassroots of the movement he knew so well. He introduced me to some of the people who would run my campaign and also to Donald Trump Jr."

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — Belarus freed 52 political prisoners on Thursday as part of a deal brokered by the United States, which lifted some sanctions on the country's national airline.

It was another sign of a possible rapprochement between Washington and Minsk, a close ally of Russia that has faced Western isolation for years. U.S. President Donald Trump and Belarus' Alexander Lukashenko spoke on the phone last month, and the American leader even suggested a face-to-face meeting could be in the works.

That would be a big win for Lukashenko, who has ruled his nation of 9.5 million with an iron fist for more than three decades. Belarus has been repeatedly sanctioned by Western countries both for its crackdown on human rights and allowing Moscow to use its territory in the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

But more recently, Lukashenko has sought to mend ties with the West in the hopes of easing the sanctions. He has regularly released prisoners as a way to win favor, including freeing Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a key dissident and the husband of exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, in June.

The concession from the U.S. came a day after Poland denounced an incursion of Russian drones into its territory — saying some came from Belarus — in what Western officials called an act of aggression. NATO jets were scrambled and shot some of the drones down.

Trump, whose country is the major military power in NATO, offered an ambiguous initial response to the incursion, posting on his Truth Social platform: “What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones? Here we go!”




Trump envoy John Coale announced the lifting of sanctions at a meeting with Lukashenko in Minsk on Thursday.

Some sanctions on Belarus national carrier, Belavia, were relaxed in light of prisoner releases so far, according to a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic conversations. That will allow the airline to repair and buy parts for its planes, including Boeing aircraft.

The airline was sanctioned by the European Union, the U.S., and others after Belarusian flight controllers ordered a commercial jet traveling from Greece to Lithuania to land in Minsk. Once the plane landed, authorities arrested Raman Pratasevich, a dissident journalist who was on board.

Lukashenko, who has relied on Russia's loans and cheap energy to keep Belarus' economy afloat, called the move “very important.” 

Tsikhanouskaya, Belarus' opposition leader in exile, warned that the easing of sanctions could allow Moscow, whose aviation industry has been sanctioned, to get airplane parts through Belavia.

“We understand that this is part of the deal,” she told The Associated Press. “But lifting sanctions without systemic changes in the country could open loopholes that both the Lukashenko regime and Russia will use to circumvent the sanctions.”

That could also create new opportunities for Belarus in its relationship with Russia. Minsk will be able to resell the parts to Moscow “at a very favorable price,” said independent analyst Valery Karbalevich, and it makes “the Kremlin's leash” on Belarus “a little longer.” 

One of the prisoners released Thursday, veteran opposition activist Mikalai Statkevich, refused to cross into Lithuania and tried to return to Belarus, but was blocked by the border guards, Anatol Lyabedzka, a key activist on Tsikhanouskaya's team, told AP in a phone interview from a Lithuanian border crossing where the prisoners were handed over. 

Lyabedzka said that Statkevich was standing in the no-man's land between Lithuania and Belarus. “Statkevich is showing courage and strength of character,” the activist said. “He decided not to let Lukashenko kick him out of the country and is resisting a forced deportation.” 

Statkevich's refusal recalled a similar one by Maria Kolesnikova, a key leader in the mass protests that rocked Belarus in 2020. She became a symbol of Belarusian resistance after the authorities tried to deport her in September 2020. Driven to the Ukrainian border, she briefly broke away from security forces, tore up her passport, and walked back into Belarus. She was convicted a year later on charges including conspiracy to seize power and sentenced to 11 years in prison. 

The other 51 freed prisoners have crossed into Lithuania, Lyabedzka said. 

Statkevich, one of Lukashenko's most prominent and charismatic opponents, attempted to run for president in 2010, but was arrested, convicted on charges of organizing mass riots and sentenced to six years. Amnesty International recognized him as a prisoner of conscience, and in 2015 he was released under pressure from the U.S. 

Statkevich was arrested again before the 2020 elections, found guilty once more of organizing mass riots, and sentenced to another 14 years. He has been held incommunicado since February 2023.

Also among those released were Ihar Losik, a journalist for U.S. government-funded broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, as well other journalists and bloggers, party and union leaders, and 14 foreigners.

Franak Viachorka, Tsikhanouskaya's senior advisor, told AP that while most of the released Belarusians are in “normal physical and psychological condition,” some need urgent medical care.

Elena Ramanauskienė — a Lithuanian who was detained in Belarus while visiting, convicted of espionage and sentenced to six years — burst into tears after stepping from the bus that brought her and some of the others back, and thanked those who made her release possible. 

But some Belarusians viewed their release differently. “It's very cruel that I served my entire three-year sentence, and now I've been deported,” said Larysa Shchyrakova, a 52-year-old journalist who was almost done serving her 3 1/2-year prison term in her hometown of Gomel. 

“I have no home, no relatives here – nothing,” Shchyrakova told reporters in Vilnius. “What's more, my mother died while I was in prison, so now I can't even go to her grave.”

Almost 1,200 political prisoners remain behind bars in Belarus, according to human rights group Viasna, and Trump has said he wants to win the release of more. 

There have been signs of Trump seeking a thaw with Lukashenko — much as he has with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Soon after hosting Putin for talks in Alaska last month, Trump hinted he was working on a deal to win the release of hundreds of prisoners held in Belarus after holding a “wonderful talk” with Lukashenko.

Trump announced in a social media posting following the call — his first publicized engagement with Belarussian leader during his second term — that the purpose of the conversation was to thank Lukashenko for the June prisoner release. 

But the U.S. leader said the two also talked about the potential release of many more being held in Belarus.

Trump also added: “I look forward to meeting President Lukashenko in the future.”

That would be a remarkable turnaround for a leader who has been widely shunned for his relentless repression of the opposition and independent media, especially after tens of thousands of people poured into the streets to protest his reelection in August 2020, in a vote widely seen as rigged. 

In the ensuing crackdown, tens of thousands were detained. Prominent opposition figures either fled the country or were imprisoned. 

Lukashenko has since extended his rule for a seventh term in another election that the opposition called a farce.

An attendee of the event at a Utah university campus where Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and close ally of President Donald Trump, was shot and killed Wednesday, said “there wasn't any security checkpoints.”

In a video message from the Oval Office late Wednesday, President Donald Trump called Kirk “a martyr for truth and freedom” and condemned the “demonizing” of political opponents in the U.S.

Marking the solemn 24th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, President Donald Trump announced he will posthumously award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was shot and killed Wednesday afternoon at a Utah college event.

OREM, Utah (AP) — The sniper who assassinated Charlie Kirk is believed to have jumped off a roof and fled into a neighborhood after firing one shot and has not been identified, authorities said Thursday in disclosing they have recovered a high-powered, bolt-action rifle they believe was used in the attack and are reviewing video footage of the person they believe was responsible.

The shooter appeared to be of college age and blended in on the university campus where Kirk was killed Wednesday, said Beau Mason, the commissioner of the Utah Department of Public Safety. It remained unclear how far the shooter has traveled, though law enforcement officials say nearby woods where the rifle was found have been secured.

Kirk's casket is to be flown from Utah to Arizona aboard Air Force Two on Thursday.

Even as law enforcement officials revealed new details about an attack they called targeted, much remained unclear nearly 24 hours later, including the sniper's identity, motive and whereabouts. Two people detained Wednesday were released after neither was determined to be connected to the shooting, but by Thursday officials expressed confidence they had tracked the shooter's movements on campus in the run-up to it.

Later Thursday, the FBI released two photos of a person of interest in connection with the shooting as investigators appealed to the public for information. The photos show a person wearing a hat, sunglasses and a long-sleeve black shirt.

Law enforcement recovered a Mauser .30 caliber bolt-action rifle hidden in a towel in a wooded area near the university campus along what they suspect to be the shooter's path as they fled the scene, according to information circulated among law enforcement and shared with The Associated Press. Besides the spent cartridge recovered in the chamber, three other rounds were loaded in the magazine. The weapon and ammunition are being forensically analyzed by law enforcement at a federal lab for clues that could help identify the shooter or the motive.

Kirk, a close ally of President Donald Trump, was killed in broad daylight while speaking about social issues at a Utah Valley University campus courtyard. The circumstances brought renewed attention to the escalating threat of political violence in the United States that in the last several years has cut across the ideological spectrum. The killing drew bipartisan condemnation, but a national reckoning over ways to prevent political grievances from manifesting as deadly violence seemed elusive.




The attack was captured on grisly videos circulating on social media that show Kirk speaking into a handheld microphone when suddenly a shot rings out. Kirk can be seen reaching up with his right hand as blood gushes from the left side of his neck. Stunned spectators gasp and scream before people start running away.

Trump said he would award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the U.S., while Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, were set to visit with Kirk's family in Salt Lake City. Vance posted a remembrance on X chronicling their friendship, dating back to initial messages in 2017, through Vance's Senate run and ultimately praying after hearing of the shooting. Kirk played a pivotal role in setting up Trump's second Republican administration, Vance wrote.

“So much of the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene,” Vance wrote. “He didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.”

Kirk was speaking at a debate hosted by his nonprofit political youth organization, Arizona-based Turning Point USA, at the Sorensen Center courtyard on campus. Immediately before the shooting, he took questions from an audience member about gun violence.

“Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?” the person asked. Kirk responded, “Too many.”

The questioner followed up: “Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?”

“Counting or not counting gang violence?” Kirk asked.

Then a shot rang out. 

The shooter, who Gov. Spencer Cox pledged would be held accountable in a state with the death penalty, wore dark clothing and fired from a building roof some distance away.

Madison Lattin was watching a few dozen feet from Kirk's left when she heard the bullet hit him.

“Blood is falling and dripping down, and you're just like so scared, not just for him but your own safety,” she said.

She saw people drop to the ground in an eerie silence pierced immediately by cries. She and others ran. Some fell and were trampled in the stampede.

When Lattin later learned that Kirk had died, she wept, she said, describing him as a role model who had showed her how to fight for the truth.

About 3,000 people were in attendance, according to a statement from the Utah Department of Public Safety. The university police department had six officers working the event, along with Kirk's own security detail, authorities said. 

Trump announced Kirk's death on social media and praised the 31-year-old co-founder and CEO of Turning Point as “Great, and even Legendary.” Later, he released a video in which he called Kirk a “martyr for truth and freedom.”

Utah Valley University said the campus was evacuated after the shooting and will be closed until Monday.

Meanwhile, armed officers walked around the neighborhood bordering the campus, knocking on doors and asking for any information residents might have on the shooting. Helicopters buzzed overhead. 

Wednesday's event, billed as the first stop on Kirk's “The American Comeback Tour,” had generated a polarizing campus reaction. An online petition calling for university administrators to bar Kirk from appearing received nearly 1,000 signatures. The university issued a statement last week citing First Amendment rights and affirming its “commitment to free speech, intellectual inquiry, and constructive dialogue.”

Last week, Kirk posted on X images of news clips showing his visit was sparking controversy. He wrote, “What's going on in Utah?”

The shooting drew swift bipartisan condemnation as Democratic officials joined Trump, who ordered flags lowered to half-staff and issued a presidential proclamation, and other Republican allies of Kirk in decrying the violence.

“The murder of Charlie Kirk breaks my heart. My deepest sympathies are with his wife, two young children, and friends,” said Gabrielle Giffords, the former Democratic congresswoman who was wounded in a 2011 shooting in her Arizona district.

In a joint statement, the Young Democrats of Connecticut and the Connecticut Young Republicans called the shooting “unacceptable.”

“There is no place in our country for such acts regardless of political disagreements,” they said.

The shooting appeared poised to become part of a spike of political violence that has touched a range of ideologies and representatives of both major political parties. The attacks include the assassination of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband at their house in June, the firebombing of a Colorado parade in June to demand Hamas release hostages and a fire set at the house of Pennsylvania's governor, who is Jewish, in April. The most notorious of these events is the shooting of Trump during a Pennsylvania campaign rally last year.

            • 24th anniversary of 9/11: Lawmakers and officials are paying tribute to the victims of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. President Donald Trump spoke during memorial services at the Pentagon this morning and is set to travel to New York this afternoon to attend a game at Yankee Stadium.
    


            • Trump ally killed: The fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah college campus event has shaken the political world, with both Republicans and Democrats condemning the violence. Vice President JD Vance plans to travel to Utah today, according to a source.
    


            The two leading Democrats in Congress appeared to agree in a private meeting Thursday morning that they could not support a so-called clean short-term government funding bill this month, ratcheting up the chances of a funding showdown with Republicans, according to three people briefed on the meeting.
    


            In the meeting, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his leadership team stressed emphatically to their Senate counterparts that their members could not support a “clean” short-term funding extension, those people said.
    


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer appeared to agree, and Senate Democrats made clear that they understood they couldn't support just a “clean” bill, those people said.
    


            It's not yet clear whether this could trigger a shutdown after the September 30 deadline. The exact definition of “clean” stopgap is ambiguous on Capitol Hill, since GOP leaders have not formally put forward their own spending plan. Many Democrats on the Senate side are still eager to reach an agreement with their GOP counterparts that can avoid that painful funding lapse.
    


            And Democrats have been careful not to say publicly what they will seek from President Donald Trump and the GOP, since Democrats want Republicans to put forward an offer before outlining their own demands.
    


            Privately, top House Democrats say they want an extension of the Affordable Care Act subsidies expiring in December, among other demands. Schumer, too, has said he wants the GOP to extend those subsidies but has been cautious not to draw any red lines in public.
    


            Senators from both parties somberly reflected on the state of political violence in the country after the murder of Charlie Kirk, expressing the need for more vigilance when it comes to security and a dampening of political animosity.
    


            “We're in a moment that is sickening and stomach turning, but also profoundly scary as a public official who goes to fairs, parades, every weekend in public,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal told CNN's Manu Raju on Thursday, adding that he's had to “really rethink” how he spends time in public in the interest of safety.
    


                    Responding to President Donald Trump blaming rhetoric from the “radical left” for causing political violence, Blumenthal said, “Violence of all kinds is abhorrent, and the attempt to attribute it to one political view or another, I think, misses the point.”
                





            Asked about security concerns, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham responded, “I think we just need to be smart,” explaining that violent people “try to scare you into inaction.”
    


            The South Carolina Republican noted the anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, saying, “Twenty-four years after 9/11, the Mideast is on fire, Russia is, has invaded Ukraine yet again, almost a million people have been killed or injured, and Russian drones went into Polish airspace.
    


                    “This is a very dangerous time, so it's not just enough to remember what happened on 9/11 and mourn our losses, it's to learn from what happened on 9/11, and I think we're forgetting the lessons of 9/11,” he added.
                





            Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin called Kirk's death a tragedy, telling reporters, “Unfortunately, violence has become part of our political life that is so reprehensible but it's so common.”
    


            President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump and other administration officials paid tribute to the victims of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks on Thursday, at a ceremony in the courtyard of the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia.
    


            The event marked the 24th anniversary of the attacks, during which hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon and killed 184 people.
    


            Nearly 3,000 people were killed in total, mostly in New York, after hijacked planes crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, as well as a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
    


            President Donald Trump somberly marked the 24th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks from the Pentagon on Thursday, honoring the 2,977 victims and vowing to “never forget.”
    


            “Savage monsters attacked the very symbols of our civilization. Yet here in Virginia and in New York and in the skies over Pennsylvania, Americans did not hesitate. They stood on their feet, and they showed the world that we will never yield, we will never bend, we will never give up, and our great American flag will never, ever fail,” he said.
    


            Trump told personal stories of some of the victims, including Brian Sweeney's voicemail to his wife Julie from aboard United Flight 175; flight attendant Renée May's call to her mother to say “I love you”; Tom McGinnis, who called his wife from the 92nd floor of the North Tower to describe what he was witnessing and tell her he loved her; and Chuck Costello, who ran into the World Trade Center to free people trapped in elevators.
    


            “That day, we learned that the American heroic spirit was all around us. We saw it in the police officers, the great firefighters, the service members here at the Pentagon, and in the hearts of every American who answered history's call,” he said.
    


            Trump briefly veered into politics during his remarks, repeating his refrain that the US was a “dead country” under his predecessor and touting his effort to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.
    


            “Last year, we were a dead country. Now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world,” he said.
    


            Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth reflected on the “act of savage evil” of the 9/11 attacks while taking a swipe at what he called “nebulous missions” ordered by previous administrations.
    


            He also used a portion of his remarks at the Pentagon to pay tribute to conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was killed Wednesday.
    


            “The life, example, and even death of Christ-follower and American patriot Charlie Kirk give me hope.”
    


            “Full heart, clear eyes — like those on 9/11, you will never be forgotten,” Hegseth said.
    


            The defense secretary also reflected on his own military service, telling the audience he watched the 9/11 attacks as an Army ROTC officer while a junior in college.
    


            “Like too many Americans, I was naive to the threats brewing abroad and infiltrating our shores, but from that day forward, I felt an unshakable call to action, a duty to defend our sacred homeland with everything I had,” he said. “Like all of you, 9/11 was the ultimate validator to serve.”
    


            And Hegseth said that the Trump administration was committed to “learning the correct lessons of that day and the decades of courage that followed.”
    


            “War must not become a mere tool for global social work, eager to risk American blood and treasure from utopian fever dreams,” he said.
    


            “We should hit hard, wreak vengeance and return home. For two decades, our warriors fought with valor, valor every day, far from home, even though sometimes their leaders gave them nation-building missions and half-baked exits. Thankfully, today we have an American military that President Trump has now rebuilt twice.”
    


            President Donald Trump is speaking at the Pentagon at a memorial service on the 24th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks.
    


            Memorial services marking the 24th anniversary of 9/11 at the Pentagon are under way.
    


            President Donald Trump arrived at the Pentagon alongside first lady Melania Trump this morning.
    


            Lawmakers and officials will pay tribute to the victims of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, and Trump is scheduled to speak during the services.
    


London — Peter Mandelson was fired as Britain's ambassador to the US on Thursday, after his ties to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein became another unwelcome problem for embattled Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
    


            Mandelson had been under mounting pressure over his relationship with Epstein after US lawmakers on Monday released a “birthday book,” compiled for Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003, in which Mandelson had penned a handwritten note describing Epstein as “my best pal.”
    


            But Starmer forcefully defended his ambassador on Wednesday, telling parliament that Mandelson had his “full confidence.”
    


            Hours later, the scandal snowballed after Bloomberg published a trove of emails between Mandelson and Epstein, in which Mandelson expressed support for his friend and offered to discuss his infamous 2008 Florida case with his political contacts.
    


            Epstein pleaded guilty to two state prostitution charges and served 13 months in prison after a controversial plea deal. But the emails obtained by Bloomberg showed that Mandelson continued to support Epstein after that conviction.
    


            Britain's Foreign Office told CNN in a statement the emails showed that “the depth and extent” of the now-ex-ambassador's relationship with Epstein is “materially different from that known at the time of his appointment.”

            Keith Kellogg, President Donald Trump's envoy for Ukraine and Russia, has arrived in the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv, Ukrainian state media reported Thursday.
    


            The arrival comes after a striking escalation of Russia's conflict in Ukraine as more than a dozen Russian drones entered Polish airspace this week.
    


            Kellogg was enroute to Poland when the Russian drone incursion occurred, according to a source familiar with his travel.
    


            Amid growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump has said he's ready to apply new sanctions on Moscow, but hasn't detailed what measures he's considering.
    


            And, so far, he hasn't applied any new punishments beyond an additional trade penalty on India over its transactions with Russia.
    


            Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance will visit Salt Lake City, Utah, today to pay respects to the family of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, according to sources familiar with his plans.
    


            They will no longer travel to New York City for the anniversary of the 9/11 terror attack as previously announced.
    


            Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, FBI Director Kash Patel, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will be in attendance, along with various New York and New Jersey officials. according to a statement from the 9/11 Memorial & Museum.
    


            Kirk was fatally shot yesterday at an event on a college campus in Utah. Follow the latest updates here.



            The vice president has called Kirk a “true friend.”



CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed reporting.



            President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump will attend memorial services at the Pentagon this morning.
    


            Later, Trump is expected to travel up to New York City to attend a game at Yankee Stadium on the anniversary of 9/11, a White House official told CNN.
    


            The New York Yankees will take on the Detroit Tigers, with the first pitch slated for 7:05 p.m. ET tonight.
    


            The White House formally communicated to House Republican leaders that it wants Congress to pass a stopgap bill that funds the government through January 31, according to a person familiar with the request.
    


            That puts the White House budget office at odds with congressional spending leaders from both parties, who want a bill that funds the government through November, while keeping pressure on appropriators to pass full-year bills.
    


            The date will be a key part of the upcoming battle to fund the government, as the current stopgap is set to expire on September 30.
    


            Some appropriators in both parties have privately expressed fears the White House budget office is pushing for another full-year “continuing resolution,” which gives the administration more power and flexibility to alter Congress' funding plans.

Watch live the 9/11 anniversary ceremony at the World Trade Center site in New York.

NEW YORK (AP) — Nearly a quarter century has passed since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but for many, the emotions of the day remain raw as ever.

On Thursday, America marked the 24th anniversary of the deadly attacks with solemn ceremonies in New York, at the Pentagon and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The commemorations were punctuated by moments of silence, the tolling of bells and the reading of the names of the nearly 3,000 killed.

“Even 24 years later, it's heart-wrenching,” said Jennifer Nilsen, who wore a T-shirt emblazoned with an image of her husband, Troy Nilsen, as she attended the commemoration at ground zero in lower Manhattan. “It feels the same way every year.”

Michelle Pizzo, wearing a shirt with the image of her late husband, Jason DeFazio, said she hoped more people could take a minute to reflect on the day.

“Younger kids don't realize that you have to remember,” she said.

Emma Williamson, 20, of Massachusetts, made a point to travel from her college uptown to stand near ground zero, where two memorial pools ringed by waterfalls and parapets inscribed with the names of the dead mark the spots where the twin towers once stood.

“I wasn't born when it happened, but it was really an important day in America,” she said. “It's kind of the last time we all stuck together, and that matters.”

The 9/11 anniversary, often promoted as a day of national unity, came during a time of increased politician tension. 

The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah college a day earlier prompted additional security measures at ground zero, where FBI Director Kash Patel was among the dignitaries in attendance. 

Vice President JD Vance and his wife, second lady Usha Vance, had planned to attend but instead are set to visit with Kirk's family on Thursday in Salt Lake City, according to a person familiar with Vance's plans, but not authorized to speak about them publicly.

Many in the crowd at ground zero held up photos of lost loved ones as a moment of silence marked the exact time when the first hijacked plane struck the iconic twin towers.

Loved ones then read aloud the names of the victims, with many giving personal remembrances, well wishes and updates on their lives.

Zoe Doyle, daughter of Frank Joseph Doyle, said her family created a nonprofit in his honor that's built schools in South Africa and is feeding and educating thousands of children.

Manuel DaMota Jr. said he remembers his father and namesake, Manuel DaMota, not just with grief, but with gratitude for the example he set.

“In a world filled with division and conflict, I do my best to honor my father by choosing connection, empathy and hope,” he said.

Melissa Pullis, whose husband Edward Pullis died in the towers, said this year is more difficult than others because two of the couple's three children are getting married.

“You can't walk your princess down the aisle,” she said through tears. “You are missed every day. We will always say your name, and we will always fight for justice.”

At the Pentagon in Virginia, the 184 service members and civilians killed when hijackers steered a jetliner into the headquarters of the U.S. military were honored in a ceremony attended by President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump. 

The president, in his remarks, recounted moments from that day, including snippets of conversations from passengers who were aboard the hijacked airplanes.

“Today, as one nation, we renew our sacred vow that we will never forget Sept. 11, 2001,” Trump said during the observance, which took place in an internal courtyard of the building rather than its traditional location outside its walls near the building's 9/11 memorial.

 “The enemy will always fail,” he added. “We defy the fear, endure the flames.”

The president, who was expected to attend a New York Yankees game in the Bronx on Thursday evening, also announced Kirk would be posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, calling him a “giant of his generation” and a “champion of liberty.”

And in a rural field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, a ceremony attended by Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins honored the victims of Flight 93, the hijacked plane that crashed after crew members and passengers tried to storm the cockpit.

Elsewhere, people marked the anniversary with service projects and charitable works as part of a national day of service. Volunteers took part in food and clothing drives, park and neighborhood cleanups, blood banks and other community events.



In all, the attacks by al-Qaida militants killed 2,977 people, including many financial workers at the World Trade Center and firefighters and police officers who had rushed to the burning buildings trying to save lives.

The attacks reverberated globally, altering the course of U.S. foreign and domestic policy. It led to the “ Global War on Terrorism ” and the U.S.-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and related conflicts that killed hundreds of thousands of civilians and troops.

The U.S. government has also spent billions of dollars providing health care and compensation to tens of thousands of people who were exposed to the toxic dust that billowed over parts of Manhattan when the twin towers collapsed. 

While the hijackers died in the attacks, federal officials have struggled to conclude the long-running legal case against the man accused of masterminding the plot, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. The former al-Qaida leader was arrested in 2003, but has never received a trial.

The Trump administration has also acknowledged its considering ways to take control of the ground zero memorial plaza and its underground museum, which are run by a public charity.

Rep. Randy Fine, R-Fla., on the state of political discourse following the assassination of Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk, offering a warning that America's divide may not be mended anytime soon.

House lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were left shaken on Wednesday as news traveled of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing.

One member of Congress described a "somber atmosphere" during the House's evening vote series as legislators reckoned with the tragedy in Utah – which resurfaced concerns about their own safety in what has become an emotionally charged political landscape.

"If we don't do something about this, a member of Congress is going to get killed," Rep. Randy Fine, R-Fla., told Fox News Digital. "People in my family asked me today not to run for re-election. I mean, they're scared."

Lawmakers have been forced to reckon with their own safety on multiple occasions in recent memory. 

LIVE UPDATES: MANHUNT FOR CHARLIE KIRK SHOOTER CONTINUES

The two assassination attempts against President Donald Trump in 2024, the fatal shooting of a Minnesota state lawmaker and critical injury of her colleague, a firebombing at the Pennsylvania governor's mansion, and now what the governor of Utah labeled a politically motivated assassination of the Turning Point USA founder, have all inspired new conversations about how to keep elected officials safe in an increased threat environment.

Both Fine and Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., told Fox News Digital they would be speaking with the Capitol sergeant-at-arms about getting increased security.

"I am concerned about my safety. I'm concerned about the safety of my family. I'm concerned about the safety of my employees, so we are immediately reevaluating…to make sure we have thought about every possible scenario," Mace said.

Mace said she and many of her colleagues would likely now "pause outdoor events" for the time being.

"They almost killed Donald Trump, they killed Charlie Kirk, both outdoors," she said.

Fine said, "I will probably, you know, stay in the bubble more in Washington than I might otherwise."

Others, like Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., suggested lawmakers and other political figures should be allowed more lax firearm permissions, despite Washington, D.C.'s strict gun laws.

"I know there's 435 of us. It's kind of hard, but each and every one of us are out there in the public, and there's crazy people out there," Gimenez said.

"I was concerned for my safety enough that I have a concealed weapons permit in the state of Florida. And maybe, I know that the weapons laws here in D.C. are different, but maybe…if you're a political figure, you're a representative or a senator, maybe those things, you know, we need to be exempted for our own personal safety."

He added, "I hope it doesn't happen, but there may be a tragedy, and then things will change. And I hope things will change before you have a tragedy."

"You can't help it," another House Republican told Fox News Digital when asked if they were now more concerned for their own safety. "People still are living their lives, but the topic of conversation is almost exclusively the tragedy…It puts a lot of things in perspective."

VIGILS HELD ACROSS US AFTER ASSASSINATION OF CHARLIE KIRK: 'WE MUST HEAL'

A second House Republican told Fox News Digital that they would also be limiting outdoor events but was skeptical of the feasibility of protecting all members of Congress when they are back in their home districts.

Kirk was shot from what authorities have described as a long-range distance while speaking at a student event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday afternoon. The 31-year-old, who was largely credited with energizing Gen Z voters to turn out for Trump in 2024, leaves behind a wife and two young children.

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters on Thursday morning that he's heard from "many members on both sides of the aisle" about concerns from themselves and their loved ones about their safety.

"We're in a deliberate review process right now to determine what measures are appropriate, how much we can allocate for that," Johnson said.

A third House Republican told Fox News Digital they were "devastated" by Kirk's killing and said they had been gradually increasing their own security since the assassination attempts on Trump in 2024.

"Our office steadily increased its safety protocols after the attempted assassination of POTUS last year, and we have steadily increased those precautions throughout this year as we have observed increased emotions and heightened tensions while at public events. We were already using security for most public and outdoor events, and we will continue to do so," they said via text message.

Others told reporters Wednesday that they, too, were concerned for themselves but declined to elaborate in the immediate wake of Kirk's death.

"We don't have enough resources to protect the people who are threatened around here. But I don't want to make it about us right now. This is just, it's awful," said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif.

 College Republicans of America Chairman William Donahue discusses the political legacy of Charlie Kirk on ‘Fox News Live.'

The Carolina Panthers on Thursday fired an employee who made insensitive social media posts following the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk.

Charlie Rock, a member of the team's communications department, was the staffer fired, a source briefed on the Panthers' decision confirmed to Fox News Digital.

Social media posts linked to Rock appeared to show him questioning why people were sad that Kirk had been shot and killed. The song "Protect Ya Neck" from the Wu-Tang Clan was also shared.

"The views expressed by our employees are their own and do not represent those of the Carolina Panthers," the team said in a statement posted to social media. "We do not condone violence of any kind. We are taking this matter very seriously and have accordingly addressed it with the individual."

Rock was far from the first person to lose their job for mocking the assassination of Kirk.

MSNBC fired analyst Matthew Dowd for his "unacceptable" comments about Kirk in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. The network previously denounced the comments Dowd made on the air.

"During our breaking news coverage of the shooting of Charlie Kirk, Matthew Dowd made comments that were inappropriate, insensitive and unacceptable," MSNBC President Rebecca Kutler said in a statement. "We apologize for his statements, as has he. There is no place for violence in America, political or otherwise."

Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, was struck by a single bullet around 12:20 p.m. local time on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem on Wednesday. The 31-year-old was surrounded by mostly college students as his event was getting underway.

Authorities have yet to publicly identify a suspect in the shooting. However, officials offered more details about the person they're after in a Thursday morning news conference.

FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert Bohls and Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason said they had obtained "good video footage" of the shooter while he was on the Utah Valley University Campus.

Investigators added that they believe the suspect to be "of college age."

The investigation into the assassination of Kirk was still ongoing.

            A federal judge on Wednesday blocked Trump administration restrictions on services for immigrants in the country illegally, including the federal preschool program Head Start, health clinics and adult education.
    


            The order from the judge in US District Court in Rhode Island applies to 20 states and the District of Columbia, whose attorneys general, all Democrats, sued the administration. It puts the administration's reinterpretation of a Clinton-era federal policy on hold while the case is decided.
    


            Under the proposed changes, some community-level programs would be reclassified as federal public benefits, making them inaccessible to people without legal status. Individual public benefits, such as food stamps and college financial aid, have been largely unavailable to people in the country without legal status.
    


            US District Judge Mary McElroy, who was appointed by Trump in 2019, said in her order that the policy rollout was “rushed” in a way that would worsen the impact for people cut off from community services and those tasked with verifying eligibility.
    


            “The Government argues that it has somehow interpreted this statute incorrectly for the nearly thirty years that it has been the law,” McElroy wrote. “In its view, everyone … has misunderstood it from the start – at least until last month, when the right way to read it became clear to the Government. The Court is skeptical of that.”
    


            Messages seeking comment were left with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Education Department, the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice, which each were named as defendants.
    


            The states' lawsuit argued the government failed to follow the rulemaking process and did not provide the required notice on conditions placed on federal funds.
    


            The rule changes had been paused initially within the states that sued after they reached a temporary agreement with the Trump administration.
    


            “With this victory, we are protecting children's education, safeguarding critical health care, and preserving the safety net that keeps families afloat,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said.
    


            Proponents of Head Start immediately voiced concern that the new policy would harm immigrant communities by taking away health services and educational opportunities. The administrative burdens of implementing the new rule would cause many under-resourced Head Start programs to close, according to the plaintiffs' complaint.
    


            The federal government said it interprets Head Start as a federal public benefit, similar to welfare programs that exclude immigrants in the country illegally. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, whose agency oversees Head Start, said the directive would stop diverting “hardworking Americans' tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration.”
    


            In addition to preserving Head Start access, the lawsuit also sought to block the restrictions on other federal programs, including substance abuse services, mental health resources in schools, career and technical education, and job training opportunities.

            Today, as people grieve for Charlie Kirk and express fears about what his death might portend for the future of American politics, his own words are bringing comfort and starting conversations.
    


            Politicians, pundits and free speech groups are emphasizing the point that a functioning democracy depends on resolving differences with words, not weapons.
    


            Many Kirk fans have re-upped an old clip of Kirk making that very point. In the undated clip, Kirk talked with a woman who asked about his “Prove Me Wrong” events on college campuses. The video has gained newfound attention across X, Instagram and TikTok, and Fox News has been showing it too.
    


            “When people stop talking, that's when you get violence,” Kirk said in the clip. When people stop talking, “that's when civil war happens, because you start to think the other side is so evil and they lose their humanity.”
    


            The New York Post's sorrowful front page is dominated by a similar quote from Kirk: “What we have to get back to is being able to have a reasonable disagreement where violence is not an option.”
    


            On social media sites, people are also resharing a Kirk comment from last June about resisting the urge to overreact during stressful, scary times.
    


            “When things are moving very fast and people are losing their minds, it's important to stay grounded,” Kirk wrote on X. “Turn off your phone, read scripture, spend time with friends, and remember internet fury is not real life. It's going to be ok.”
    


            Also gaining traction on social media sites: One of Kirk's last X posts, where he commented on the Charlotte train stabbing and said, “America will never be the same,” as well as his final appearance on Mark Halperin's show, where he talked of America being a violent country. “We need more prisoners, and we need more prisons,” he said.



            Kirk, who was 31 when he was assassinated on Wednesday, was a deeply polarizing figure, generating liberal detractors as he gained conservative supporters.
    


            If you weren't a fan of Kirk, my humble advice is to absorb some of what his friends are posting and sharing today — like these X blog posts by JD Vance and Michael Knowles — to better understand where they're coming from.
    


            “Prove Me Wrong” were the three words that Kirk used to challenge people to debate him in public. When he invited me to debate him a few years ago, he wrote, “I'm trying to be proactive about encouraging dialogue between people who disagree.”
    


            That's a key part of Kirk's legacy now. “He created platforms not just for himself to express his political opinion, but for others to express theirs as well,” Nico Perrino of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression said on “CNN This Morning.” And Kirk “paid for it yesterday with his life.”
    


            “Free speech is what we do instead of violence,” Perrino said. “I think we should all hope that we live in a society, an open society, where we can have our debates and our disagreements out in the public and not from behind bulletproof vests and bulletproof glass.”
    


            Veteran conservative organizer Matt Schlapp said on Newsmax and X that young people will “make Charlie awfully proud if you continued fighting. But also if you fought in a way where at the end of the day, you can go have a cup of coffee with someone who you disagree with, and show that there's a humanity to this important endeavor that we're involved in.”
    


            Entertainers and other public figures have joined the calls for a collective lowering of the temperature in the wake of the shooting. Stephen Colbert opened “The Late Show” on Wednesday night by saying, “Political violence only leads to more political violence, and I pray with all my heart that this is the aberrant action of a madman and not a sign of things to come.”
    


            Yes, that's happening in some corners, but not all. The tone on “Fox & Friends” was mournful on Thursday, for example, and the hosts pointed out that Democrats have joined Republicans in condemning the assassination.
    


            At the same time, however, “in some corners of the MAGA ecosystem, heartbreak over Kirk's killing turned swiftly into rage,” Axios pointed out in a Thursday morning newsletter. According to Wired, some extremist groups are calling “for civil war and violent retribution.”
    


            News coverage is always a balancing act, of course, but I think it's important to lift up responsible voices in this moment, and not just linger on the provocateurs who loudly sow discord.
    


            Rhetoric professor Matthew Boedy, who has a book coming out later this month, “The Seven Mountains Mandate,” focusing on Kirk as the “new face of Christian nationalism,” said “we crossed a line in our nation yesterday and I can only think we will cross more.”
    


            Boedy's book is highly critical of the movement Kirk represented, so I asked if he fears blowback. “My family certainly brought that up,” he said. He called President Trump's Wednesday night comments about the “radical” left “disturbing.”
    


            Meanwhile, many MAGA media leaders are pointing out the threats that they regularly receive, and multiple media organizations are reevaluating their security plans in the wake of this shooting.
    


            “I despair on behalf of my country,” conservative radio host and influencer Ben Shapiro said Wednesday.
    


            Shapiro said he had talked with Kirk about their shared security concerns in the past.
    


            “I do not know what this means for America, truly,” he said. “When political figures who just are out to discuss and debate in public are gunned down in cold blood, I do not know what we can expect next.”

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — Belarus freed 52 political prisoners on Thursday as part of a deal brokered by the United States, which lifted some sanctions on the country's national airline.

It was another sign of a possible rapprochement between Washington and Minsk, a close ally of Russia that has faced Western isolation for years. U.S. President Donald Trump and Belarus' Alexander Lukashenko spoke on the phone last month, and the American leader even suggested a face-to-face meeting could be in the works.

That would be a big win for Lukashenko, who has ruled his nation of 9.5 million with an iron fist for more than three decades. His country has been repeatedly sanctioned by Western countries both for its crackdown on human rights and allowing Moscow to use its territory in the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

But for more than a year, Lukashenko has sought to mend ties with the West in the hopes of easing the sanctions. He has regularly released prisoners as a way to win favor, including freeing Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a key dissident and the husband of exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, in June.

The concession from the U.S. came a day after Poland denounced an incursion of Russian drones into its territory — some from Belarus — in what Western officials called an act of aggression. NATO jets were scrambled and shot some of the drones down.

Trump, whose country is the major military power in NATO, offered an ambiguous initial response to the incursion, posting on his Truth Social platform: “What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones? Here we go!”

Some sanctions on Belarus national carrier, Belavia, were relaxed in light of prisoner releases so far, according to a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic conversations. That will allow the airline to repair and buy parts for its planes, including Boeing aircraft.

The airline was sanctioned by the European Union, the U.S., and others after Belarusian flight controllers ordered a commercial jet traveling from Greece to Lithuania to land in Minsk. Once the plane landed, authorities arrested Raman Pratasevich, a dissident journalist who was on board.

The prisoner release was made public after Trump envoy John Coale met with Lukashenko in Minsk and announced the lifting of the sanctions.

Tsikhanouskaya, Belarus' opposition leader in exile, warned that the easing of sanctions could create new leverage for both Minsk and Moscow, whose aviation industry has been heavily sanctioned, since Russia invaded Ukraine. Lukashenko allowed the Kremlin to use Belarusian territory to send troops and weapons into Ukraine during the invasion. 

“We understand that this is part of the deal,” she told The Associated Press. “But lifting sanctions without systemic changes in the country could open loopholes that both the Lukashenko regime and Russia will use to circumvent the sanctions.”

One of the prisoners released Thursday, veteran opposition activist Mikalai Statkevich, refused to cross into Lithuania, a person who spoke to the dissident and another person who spoke to his wife told AP. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.

They said that the 69-year-old was standing in the no-man's land between Lithuania and Belarus. He repeatedly tried to return to Belarus, but border guards blocked his path.

Kristina Belikova, the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, confirmed that one of the prisoners has not crossed into Lithuania and his fate remains unknown. She did not say who it was.

Statkevich, one of Lukashenko's most prominent and charismatic opponents, attempted to run for president in 2010, but was arrested, convicted on charges of organizing mass riots and sentenced to sentenced to six years. Amnesty International recognized him as a prisoner of conscience, and in 2015 he was released under pressure from the United States.

Statkevich was arrested again before the 2020 elections, found guilty once more of organizing mass riots, and sentenced to another 14 years. He has been held incommunicado since February 2023.

Also among those released was Ihar Losik, a journalist for U.S. government-funded broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, according to human rights group Viasna. The 33-year-old was convicted of “organizing mass riots, taking part in mass disorder, inciting social hatred,” and several other charges that remain unclear, according to the broadcaster. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison in December 2021.

The prisoners also included 14 foreigners — six Lithuanians, two Latvians, two Poles, two Germans, one French national and one U.K. national — according to the Belarusian presidency. 

Almost 1,200 political prisoners remain behind bars in Belarus, according to Viasna, and Trump has said he wants to win the release of more. 

There have been signs of Trump seeking a thaw with Lukashenko — much as he has with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Soon after hosting Putin for talks in Alaska last month, Trump hinted that he was working on a deal to win the release of hundreds of prisoners held in Belarus after holding a “wonderful talk” with Lukashenko.

Trump announced in a social media posting following the call — his first publicized engagement with Belarussian leader during his second term — that the purpose of the conversation was to thank Lukashenko for the June prisoner release, which followed the visit of a senior U.S. envoy. 

But the U.S. leader said the two also talked about the potential release of many more being held in Belarus.

Trump also added: “I look forward to meeting President Lukashenko in the future.”

That would be a remarkable turnaround for a leader who has been widely shunned for his relentless repression on the opposition and independent media, especially after tens of thousands of people poured into the streets to protest his reelection in August 2020, in a vote widely seen as rigged. 

In the ensuing crackdown, tens of thousands were detained. Prominent opposition figures either fled the country or were imprisoned. 

Lukashenko has since extended his rule for a seventh term in another election that the opposition called a farce.

"My heart HURTS for them. For America," she captioned one of the posts on her Stories.

She was among those in the sports world to react to Kirk's death. The wife of the Las Vegas Raiders running back joined Tim Tebow, Mark Teixeira, Brett Favre, Bruce Pearl and others in offering their thoughts and prayers for Kirk and his family.

Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, was struck by a single bullet around 12:20 p.m. local time on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem on Wednesday. The 31-year-old was surrounded by mostly college students as his event was getting underway.

Authorities have yet to publicly identify a suspect in the shooting. However, officials offered more details about the person they're after in a Thursday morning news conference.

FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert Bohls and Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason said they obtained "good video footage" of the shooter while he was on the Utah Valley University Campus.

Investigators added that they believe the suspect to be "of college age."

Country star John Rich of the music duo "Big & Rich" spoke with Fox News Digital about his endorsement of Jody Barrett in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District.

Country artist John Rich is "rollin'" into Tennessee's upcoming special election with his own endorsement in what's shaping up to be a crowded GOP primary race.

Rich, who makes up half of the iconic duo Big & Rich, is campaigning alongside his longtime friend, state Rep. Jody Barrett, as he runs to replace former Homeland Security Committee Chair Mark Green in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District.

"I've known Jody, believe this or not, since we were seniors in high school together. We actually graduated the same high school," Rich told Fox News Digital in an interview.

"We kept in touch, stayed good friends. But in the past four or five years, Jody has been a state rep in Tennessee. And so issues that were happening in Tennessee, Jody and I would join forces, him kind of on the inside of the political world and me standing on the outside with a really big platform and big audience. And we would work together, hand in hand, arm in arm, to make things happen."

Barrett is one of 10 Republicans running to replace Green in the Oct. 7 primary.

The general election is scheduled for Dec. 2. But in the deep-red 7th District, which President Donald Trump won by more than 20 points in 2024, it's likely the winner of the GOP primary will come out on top.

Barrett, along with state Rep. Gino Bulso, state Rep. Lee Reeves, and former Tennessee General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps, were the only Republicans invited to debate their candidacy earlier this week by Americans for Prosperity Tennessee, according to Tennessee Lookout.

Rich told Fox News Digital that in addition to appearing alongside Barrett at campaign events, he's also promoted the conservative House hopeful to Trump himself.

"I've actually texted the president a couple of times about Jody. I said, ‘You're going to want this guy in Congress. I mean, this is one of your guys.' And so I'm hoping President Trump, maybe he weighs in on this race," Rich said.

He added, however, that it's possible Trump stays away from endorsing until after the primary is over.

Barrett has supported Trump on a broad range of issues, though he notably broke from the president's COVID-19 vaccine initiative, called Operation Warp Speed, during the Monday night debate.

"We have millions of Americans now who are vaccine injured, dealing with the results of this vaccine mandate," Barrett said at the time.

Nevertheless, Rich said Barrett has connected with Republicans in Tennessee, and he praised him for occasionally challenging establishment GOP aims and decisions in the state.

"What I love about real conservatives is we will call out people in our own party if we think they're making a mistake, if they're on the wrong path," Rich said. "Whereas on the left, they just fall in line and do whatever they're told every single time. Jody has proven that he will stand up for what his people want."

He said at another point in the interview, "He's legit. I mean, we start talking about what's a conservative look like? It's this guy. And again, when you've known somebody since you were 17, and now you're in your early 50s, and they're the same guy, that's pretty rare."

Barrett has also been endorsed by the House Freedom Fund, the political arm of the House Freedom Caucus.

"Jody Barrett's strong conservative record of leadership, not only standing up to Democrats, but also his own party when the RINOs get out of line, is exactly what House Freedom Fund looks for in a candidate," Allison Weisenberger of the House Freedom Fund told Fox News Digital.

Barrett himself told Fox News Digital he was "honored" to have Rich's endorsement.

"John Rich is my lifelong friend, a proud Tennessean, a country music legend and one of President Trump's strongest supporters in our state. Having his endorsement means a lot, because he has never been afraid to speak the truth and stand up for conservative values," Barrett said.

FBI officials recovered the bolt-action rifle used in the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk on Wednesday at a Utah Valley University event. The assassin remains at large.

“They have a virtual manhunt out there, so we'll see what happens,” President Donald Trump said Thursday morning after a event commemorating 9/11. “But we hope we get him.”

Two suspects were arrested in the hours following the assassination, but both were released following questioning. As of writing, the killer has been at large for over 18 hours.

POLITICAL VIOLENCE ON THE RISE IN THE US: A TIMELINE OF KEY INCIDENTS

Here's everything to know about the manhunt for Kirk's killer:

At a Thursday press conference, authorities said they recovered the murder weapon: a high-powered, bolt-action rifle. The weapon was left in a wooded area, which has since been swept and secured.

The FBI is working to get evidence from a palm, forearm, and foot print from the scene.

Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason told reporters that authorities had a “good video” of the shooter. The suspect was described as being of college age and arrived on campus about half an hour before the murder. The assassin jumped off the roof after the shooting and fled into a nearby neighborhood. Officials are looking through doorbell and other security footage that may have caught the shooter.

Mason said authorities had been several “breakthroughs” on Wednesday night.

“We were able to track the movements of the shooter… We tracked his movements onto the campus, through the stairwells, up to the roof, across the roof to a shooting location. After the shooting, we were able to track his movements as he moved to the other side of the building, jumped off of the building, and fled off of the campus and into a neighborhood,” Mason said.

He said authorities were utilizing technology to track the shooter and were confident in their ability to do so.

“We've invested everything we have into this and we will catch this individual,” Mason said.

The killing was believed to be a targeted event and there is no danger to the public, the authorities said. No motive has been established.

FBI Salt Lake City Special Agent in Charge Robert Bohls said authorities have received over 130 tips since the investigation began.

A live feed of the Utah County police scanner described the suspected shooter as wearing jeans, a black shirt, a black mask, and a black vest and carrying a “long rifle.” Another officer said the shooter was wearing a “black mask.”

Mason confirmed the description at a press conference, saying the suspect was wearing all dark clothing.

The assassin is believed to have shot Kirk from a position on top of the Sorensen Student Center, several hundred feet away from him, and then made a hasty retreat.

The FBI created a digital tip line for members of the public to submit information.

The FBI and Utah Department of Public Safety are co-leading the manhunt, “in unison with the Utah County Attorney's Office, the Utah County Sheriff's Office, and the local police departments,” according to a statement from the Utah DPS.

FBI Salt Lake City Special Agent in Charge Robert Bohls said the agency was providing tactical, operational, investigative, and intelligence support.

Mason outlined the difficulties in the investigation, stressing that the crime scene was a “very large area,” ABC News reported. He said the “only information” they have as of late Wednesday was taken from CCTV footage on campus.

Authorities are combing through all footage related to the event.

“They could be using cellphone data … cameras, you know. A lot of jurisdictions — and I don't know if the university had it — have license plate readers that capture license tags or surveillance cameras from public street lights and things like that around the time of the shooting or shortly thereafter,” Chris J. Quick, a retired FBI special agent with over 30 years of federal law enforcement experience, told the Washington Examiner.

As for what investigators will be looking into, Quick said the gun used will give them a lot of information.

“That was either a hunting rifle or an AR-style rifle — probably with a scope. That tells investigators a lot. They'll be going to gun stores, looking for purchases of that kind of weapon. The bullet itself will tell a lot about what type of weapon they're looking for,” he said.

“It looks premeditated. If it was planned — and it appears to be — then it's about identifying what steps were taken before the shooting and tracing those backwards. That's how cases like this are built,” he added. 

Despite the wide-ranging manhunt, there were no immediate reports of any major highway or airport closures. Security measures were limited to college campuses in Utah. The site of the shooting is about 8 miles from the nearest airport, Provo Airport.

The UVU campus will be closed for the rest of the week, and classes have been canceled for several days.

Several Utah universities increased security and police presence on their campuses, including the University of Utah, Brigham Young University, and Southern Utah University.

The first man detained within minutes of the murder was George Zinn. Footage on social media showed him being handcuffed and taken away by police. Videos showed shocked bystanders jeering at the man as he was escorted. He was widely labeled as the shooter on social media.

Shortly thereafter, Zinn was released and is no longer a suspect. The Utah DPS said the UVU police charged him with obstruction.

Several hours after the murder, FBI Director Kash Patel announced the arrest of a suspect.

“The subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody. Thank you to the local and state authorities in Utah for your partnership with @fbi,” Patel said in a post on X.

The man was identified by the Utah DPS as Zachariah Qureshi. He was quickly released after questioning by the police and is no longer a suspect.

Patel announced an hour and a half later that the suspect had been released “after an interrogation by law enforcement.

“Our investigation continues and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency,” he added.

            Belarus has pardoned 52 prisoners and released them into Lithuania, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda said on Thursday, as the Baltic nation and Belarus both thanked US President Donald Trump for his involvement.
    


            It is the latest release of political prisoners by Belarus amid warming relations between Washington and Minsk. A Trump administration official said the United States would ease some sanctions on Belarus' state-run airline, Belavia, “based on the prisoner releases to date and constructive engagement.” 



            In a statement on social media, Nausėda hailed the release of the political prisoners,﻿ saying “No man left behind!”
    


            “52 prisoners safely crossed the Lithuanian border from Belarus today, leaving behind barbed wire, barred windows and constant fear,” the Lithuanian president wrote, adding that he is personally and “deeply grateful” to the US and Trump.
    


            “52 is a lot. A great many,” he added. “Yet more than 1,000 political prisoners still remain in Belarusian prisons and we cannot stop until they see freedom!”
    


            Their release comes after Belarus' strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko met Thursday with senior Trump administraiton official John Coale, who traveled to Minsk at Trump's direction.﻿



            The two discussed “a range of issues, including additional prisoner releases and regional security issues, like ending the weaponization of illegal migration from Belarus into neighboring NATO countries,” the Trump administration official said.
    


            Coale informed Lukashenko of the easing of certain sanctions on Belavia, the official said, noting that this “limited relief package will allow Belavia to service and buy components for its existing fleet, which includes Boeing aircraft.”
    


            The US welcomed the release of the political prisoners, and the official said they would “continue to work to free the nearly 1,300 remaining political prisoners in Belarus.”
    


            Lukashenko announced that 14 foreign nationals are among those Belarus released “at the request of the President of the United States,” according to his presidential pool. Those released include six Lithuanian nationals, two Latvians, two Poles, two Germans, and one person each from France and the United Kingdom, the pool said.
    


            Belarus said Coale indicated the US wants to reopen its embassy in Minsk, but he did not specify a date.
    


            Belarus also said Coale passed along a letter from Trump and the American first lady, in which they wished Lukashenko well, and presented him with a gift of cufflinks featuring an image of the White House.
    


            “No matter how banal it may sound, I want to thank your President (Trump) – not because I want to flatter him, that's foreign to me – for the efforts he is making toward peace, primarily in our region,” Lukashenko said in an opening statement at the meeting.
    


            Russian state media TASS reported that the 52 people were pardoned “on humanitarian grounds” and “as a gesture of goodwill” following the request of Trump and other world leaders.

            Nausėda confirmed that six Lithuanians have been freed. Polish state media also reported that Polish nationals have been pardoned.
    


            However, a full list of the pardoned prisoners has not yet been released.
    


            The human rights group Viasna said in a post on Telegram that among those released is Mikola Statkevich, a former Belarusian presidential candidate and political prisoner who was detained in 2020 and sentenced to 14 years in a penal colony. Nothing had been known about his condition since February 9, 2023, Viasna said.
    


            Human rights activists and independent Belarusian media have reported the release of other prominent political prisoners, including activist and philosopher Uladzimir Matskevich and Lithuanian citizen Elena Romanauskiene.
    


            Earlier this year, Belarus freed Sergey Tikhanovsky, a key dissident figure and the husband of exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, following another rare visit by a senior US official, Tikhanovskaya's team announced in June.

The fatal stabbing of Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light rail train has put a spotlight on former Gov. Roy Cooper's record on criminal justice in the high-stakes North Carolina Senate race. 

Cooper, a Democrat, is facing Michael Whatley, the former Republican National Committee chairman, for the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC). Crime has become a flashpoint in the race after the release of video footage showing Zarutska, a Ukrainian refugee, sitting unsuspectingly in front of her would-be killer before he stood up and brutally stabbed her on a commuter train. 

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT FATAL STABBING OF UKRAINIAN REFUGEE ON CHARLOTTE'S LIGHT RAIL

Police identified the suspect as Decarlos Brown Jr, 34, who has a lengthy criminal history, including convictions for armed robbery, felony larceny, and breaking and entering. Republicans, led by President Donald Trump, have called for the death penalty in the case and blamed lenient policies by Democrats and judges for Brown being free to kill.

Central to that debate is Cooper's 2020 Task Force for Racial Equity in Criminal Justice, created after the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. The panel issued over 100 recommendations, from limiting cash bail for misdemeanors to expanding racial equity training for prosecutors. While the Republican-led legislature never adopted many proposals, some elements have been implemented, including new law enforcement training standards and accreditation programs.

Supporters argue the task force helped modernize parts of the justice system and address racial disparities. Critics contend it set a tone of leniency, a charge Republicans have revived in the wake of the Charlotte stabbing. Pointing to Brown's lengthy record and repeated releases, the National Republican Senatorial Committee launched a digital ad this week tying the killing directly to Cooper, accusing him of pursuing “soft-on-crime” policies as governor.

Whatley, the Republican nominee, has kept up a steady drumbeat on social media. “It's been 18 days since Iryna Zarutska was murdered on the Charlotte Light Rail, and we still haven't heard from Roy Cooper himself,” he posted Tuesday, before slamming the governor for failing to prevent repeat offenders from returning to the streets. 

When Cooper later condemned the killing as “a horrible tragedy” and accused Republicans of exploiting it for political gain, Whatley shot back: “Law enforcement did their job and arrested this thug 14 times – YOU repeatedly FAILED to do yours.”

The criticism has spread beyond the state. Vice President JD Vance amplified the attack, writing on X that “weak politicians like you… kept letting him out of prison.” Cooper responded directly on X Wednesday: “If you're really concerned about the safety of North Carolinians, Mr. Vice President, you would reverse the federal cuts to local and state law enforcement that you and Michael Whatley championed so that our police have the tools to keep North Carolinians safe.”

Sen. Ted Budd (R-NC) also weighed in, telling the Washington Examiner that the case “shows you [Cooper's] bad policies and how dangerous they are to people in some of the great cities of our state.” 

Budd pointed to the suspect's repeated releases from jail as a failure of leadership: “This guy had been released 14 times, and now she's dead.” 

He added, “This goes back to Roy Cooper and setting the tone for some very bad policies in our state. We want people, whether they're rural or whether they're in an urban setting, to be safe 24/7, wherever they are. And the policies of Roy Cooper didn't lead to that.”

Cooper's campaign stressed that the governor has a long record of prosecuting violent offenders, raising penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and keeping criminals behind bars. They described the Charlotte killing as a “despicable act of evil” and said Zarutska's family remains in their prayers. His team accused Whatley of distorting the facts to cover for his support of federal policies that reduced funding for local police.

Republicans argue the episode shows how Cooper is facing a new level of scrutiny as a Senate candidate. 

A North Carolina GOP operative noted that although many of the task force's proposals never became law, the recommendations, from eliminating cash bail to broad reforms critics describe as “coddling criminals,” now look far more significant in the glare of a statewide campaign. “There are people digging into it, and that's why this has become the opening salvo in the Senate race,” the strategist said.

Democrats, meanwhile, caution against oversimplifying the task force's role. Doug Wilson, a North Carolina Democratic strategist, said the panel was created to improve coordination between police and the communities they serve, not to weaken public safety. 

“The title to a Republican strategist or Republican elected official may sound very progressive, but it was just trying to make sure that police and the communities that they serve were in sync,” he said. 

Wilson argued the Charlotte attack resulted from several failures, from lax ticket enforcement to reliance on private security, rather than policies from Cooper's tenure. He predicted Republicans will continue to raise the stabbing as a campaign issue, and said Democrats must be ready. 

“Being tough on crime doesn't make you a bad Democrat,” Wilson said. “It makes you a Democrat who wants to make sure that his or her community is safe and that the communities that are served by police officers are in sync.”

TRUMP WANTS DEATH PENALTY FOR ‘ANIMAL' WHO KILLED IRYNA ZARUTSKA

Chris Cooper, a political science professor at Western Carolina University, said Whatley is likely to keep pressing the issue because it fits squarely into the GOP's broader crime message. 

“Because it's on video and because it's consistent with Republican rhetoric that cities have gotten out of control, I think he's certainly going to lean into this issue and try to lay blame at the feet of Roy Cooper and at the feet of cities controlled by Democrats,” he said.

But he noted the political limits, arguing that it is “a big stretch” to link a local stabbing to the former governor's power or to the task force. “I don't think most voters are going to make that kind of connection,” Cooper said. “But can it mobilize the Republican base? Yeah, I think it might help a little.”

Zeke Emanuel on RFK Jr. and the crisis of faith in public health.

US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is at war with the nation's public health establishment. He's overseen mass layoffs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; canceled $500 million in federal funding for mRNA vaccine development; and promised to end the bias against “alternative medicine.”

The country's leading scientists and physicians have started pushing back against the Trump administration's agenda, with some physician groups releasing their own Covid vaccine recommendations after Kennedy unilaterally changed the federal guidance this summer. Doctors say they're looking to protect the most vulnerable as the government turns against the long-standing public health consensus.

“I think we all actually have a duty to try to improve the country no matter who's in power,” said Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and a medical ethicist who works at the University of Pennsylvania.

Emanuel was a senior health care adviser in the Obama administration and informally counseled President Donald Trump's first administration on prescription drug prices and the early Covid-19 response. He said public health does need to be bipartisan — but Kennedy's agenda risks further dividing Americans. The health crises facing Americans are real, and we need real solutions — but Kennedy is not proposing them.

Below is an excerpt of Emanuel's conversation with Today, Explained host Sean Rameswaram, edited for length and clarity. Listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

When you heard that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would be in charge of the US health department, what were your thoughts?

I do not think he's qualified in any shape or form. He has been against vaccines, and that is very bad. Vaccines are probably the single biggest benefit to people in the 20th century in terms of total lives saved from 1974 to today. Those are huge achievements, and now, we're trying to roll them back.

The thing about Kennedy that I actually supported is his emphasis on nutrition, his emphasis on chronic diseases, and trying to address them. The problem is, so far, the big success we've gotten is removing dyes. That's not going to really save any lives.

We need to address the whole food chain and nutrition subsidies that we have in this country — whether it's SNAP [food stamps] or the food subsidies to corn, soybeans, and wheat that help us get more cheap ultra-processed foods in the food system — and those haven't been addressed. If you really want to address chronic disease in America, that is a critical step.

And yet, I don't see him really leaning into it. Yes, it's a challenge, but it's really important.

Last week, at a Senate hearing, Kennedy defended his shakeup at the CDC by saying, “We are the sickest country in the world. That's why we have to fire people at the CDC. They did not do their job. This was their job to keep us healthy.” Are we the sickest country in the world?

Well, I wouldn't say the sickest country in the world. But, in terms of high income countries, we aren't doing that well. We've fallen off the growth curve, as they say, in terms of the increase in life expectancy and the decrease in the number of disability-adjusted life years. Our health span is actually getting shorter, and that's been happening since roughly 1980.There are lots of hypotheses about that; I'll give you two that I think are really important. Richard Nixon's Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz really leaned into the production of industrial commodity crops — with heavy subsidies for corn, soybean, rice, wheat — that made the components of ultra-processed foods cheap. It really promoted big industrial farms. He often said, “Get big or get out of farming.” So, that was one element. The other element was Ronald Reagan taking over and the resulting cutbacks in the social safety net: housing, food stamps, and other programs.

That combination — spending more to get cheaper components for ultra-processed foods and reducing the social safety net — are probably two of the biggest components of the obesity epidemic we've had, which has really fueled chronic diseases. You see this in the increase in diabetes, the increase in lots of illnesses. I think if we really want to get a health care system, we have to focus on those two elements.

Do you think there are areas for improvement at the CDC?

Yes, I do think we can improve the CDC. But, let's be honest: If you're going to improve the CDC, the first place to start is not cutting its workforce, cutting its budget by billions of dollars. We're eliminating programs like the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the National Center for Environmental Health, our ability to forecast and monitor adverse health outcomes, the Public Health Preparedness and Response Center, the Global Health Center. The idea that we need to cut in order to actually improve, I think, is false.

What do you think the effects are thus far of RFK's actions at the CDC and in public health more broadly?

Here's the thing about public health: You invest today for the benefits tomorrow. So, it will take a while to actually see the effects. But we're already seeing real harms in several ways. The first way is clearly the measles outbreak in Texas — two kids dead, lots of hospitalizations. It's not just Texas now; it's spread across parts of the country. You're getting increasing vaccine skepticism in parents who are uncertain, who don't study the issue, who just are trying to go about their lives and can't really study these various issues.

When you get fewer and fewer people vaccinated, you are going to get disease outbreaks — whether today, tomorrow, or in a long time, we can't exactly predict.

I also think if chronic disease is our big problem, which RFK Jr. clearly agrees with, cutting back on our chronic disease programs, our prevention programs, our response programs, our health promotion programs — that's not a good idea. Maybe we need to do them differently, but cutting is certainly not in the cards for all those chronic diseases. If you want to control health care costs, you've got to address chronic disease better. Cutting back the CDC's role is not better.

My colleague, Dylan Scott, reported on RFK Jr. and the Trump administration burying a study about alcohol's links to cancer, and there's no clear explanation for why they'd not want this information to be in the hands of the public. Where do you think people, everyday Americans, should be turning to for health information if they feel like they can't trust the government anymore? 

The problem with undermining the CDC is you undermine the single source of information where the goal is public health. Now, it's going to put more burden on people to get their information from a variety of sources. On vaccines, maybe my good friend Michael Osterholm's Vaccine Integrity Project, if you want to look it up online. In other areas like alcohol, you'll have to look at the old Surgeon General's report and try to get a copy of that. That reported on alcohol's problems, especially related to cancer, but not exclusively. Alcohol is a global issue, so there are a lot of global resources available, whether England or Australia or the Cochrane Collaborative.

But that requires a lot more effort, and that's one of the problems. Everyone's short on time. Spending a lot of time running around and looking for individual programs rather than being able to go to one site and readily access an objective answer is a major, major problem.

I think that is part of the plan for this administration: make it very difficult to get this kind of information.

And it's working.

President Donald Trump on Sunday defended a massive immigration raid by federal agents on an electric-vehicle manufacturing site in Georgia operated by South Korean automaker Hyundai. South Korea says it has reached a deal with the U.S. for the release of detained South Korean workers.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's president said Thursday that Korean companies will likely hesitate to make further investments in the United States unless Washington improves its visa system for their employees, as U.S. authorities released hundreds of workers who were detained from a Georgia factory site last week.

In a news conference marking 100 days in office, Lee Jae Myung called for improvements in the U.S. visa system as he spoke about the Sept. 4 immigration raid that resulted in the arrest of more than 300 South Korean workers at a battery factory under construction at Hyundai's sprawling auto plant west of Savannah.

South Korea's Foreign Ministry later confirmed that U.S. authorities have released the 330 detainees – 316 of them Koreans – and that they were being transported by buses to Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport where they will board a charter flight scheduled to arrive in South Korea on Friday afternoon. The group also includes 10 Chinese nationals, three Japanese nationals and one Indonesian.

The massive roundup and U.S. authorities' release of video showing some workers being chained and taken away, sparked widespread anger and a sense of betrayal in South Korea. The raid came less than two weeks after a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Lee, and just weeks after the countries reached a July agreement that spared South Korea from the Trump administration's highest tariffs — but only after Seoul pledged $350 billion in new U.S. investments, against the backdrop of a decaying job market at home.

Lawmakers from both Lee's liberal Democratic Party and the conservative opposition decried the detentions as outrageous and heavy-handed, while South Korea's biggest newspaper compared the raid to a “rabbit hunt” executed by U.S. immigration authorities in a zeal to meet an alleged White House goal of 3,000 arrests a day.

During the news conference, Lee said South Korean and U.S. officials are discussing a possible improvement to the U.S. visa system, adding that under the current system South Korean companies “can't help hesitating a lot” about making direct investments in the U.S.

U.S. authorities said some of the detained workers had illegally crossed the U.S. border, while others entered legally but had expired visas or entered on visa waivers that prohibited them from working.

But South Korean officials expressed frustration that Washington has yet to act on Seoul's yearslong demand to ensure a visa system to accommodate skilled Korean workers, though it has been pressing South Korea to expand U.S. industrial investments.

South Korean companies have been mostly relying on short-term visitor visas or Electronic System for Travel Authorization to send workers who are needed to launch manufacturing sites and handle other setup tasks, a practice that had been largely tolerated for years.

Lee said that whether Washington establishes a visa system allowing South Korean companies to send skilled workers to industrial sites will have a “major impact” on future South Korean investments in America.

“It's not like these are long-term workers. When you build a factory or install equipment at a factory, you need technicians, but the United States doesn't have that workforce and yet they won't issue visas to let our people stay and do the work,” he said.

“If that's not possible, then establishing a local factory in the United States will either come with severe disadvantages or become very difficult for our companies. They will wonder whether they should even do it,” Lee added.

Lee said the raid showed a “cultural difference” between the two countries in how they handle immigration issues.

“In South Korea, we see Americans coming on tourist visas to teach English at private cram schools — they do it all the time, and we don't think much of it, it's just something you accept,” Lee said.

“But the United States clearly doesn't see things that way. On top of that, U.S. immigration authorities pledge to strictly forbid illegal immigration and employment and carry out deportations in various aggressive ways, and our people happened to be caught in one of those cases,” he added.

President Donald Trump on Sunday defended a massive immigration raid by federal agents on an electric-vehicle manufacturing site in Georgia operated by South Korean automaker Hyundai. South Korea says it has reached a deal with the U.S. for the release of detained South Korean workers.

Following a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Wednesday that U.S. officials have agreed to allow the workers detained in Georgia to later return to finish their work at the site. He added that the countries agreed to set up a joint working group for discussions on creating a new visa category to make it easier for South Korean companies to send their staff to work in the United States.

Before leaving for the U.S. on Monday, Cho said more South Korean workers in the U.S. could be vulnerable to future crackdowns if the visa issue isn't resolved, but said Seoul does not yet have an estimate of how many might be at risk.

The Georgia battery plant is one of more than 20 major industrial sites that South Korean companies are currently building in the United States. They include other battery factories in Georgia and several other states, a semiconductor plant in Texas, and a shipbuilding project in Philadelphia, a sector Trump has frequently highlighted in relation to South Korea.

Min Jeonghun, a professor at South Korea's National Diplomatic Academy, said it's chiefly up to the United States to resolve the issue, either through legislation or by taking administrative steps to expand short-term work visas for training purposes. 

Without an update in U.S. visa policies, Min said, “Korean companies will no longer be able to send their workers to the United States, causing inevitable delays in the expansion of facilities and other production activities, and the harm will boomerang back to the U.S. economy.”

▶ Follow live updates on Charlie Kirk's assassination

They were careful with the explicit imagery — as usual. But did it make any difference?

Traditional news organizations were cautious in their midafternoon coverage of Charlie Kirk's assassination Wednesday not to depict the moment he was shot, instead showing video of him tossing a hat to his audience moments before, and panicked onlookers scattering wildly in the moments after.

In practical terms, though, it mattered little. Gory video of the shooting was available almost instantly online, from several angles, in slow-motion and real-time speed. Millions of people watched.

Video was easy to find on X, on Facebook, on TikTok, on Instagram, on YouTube — even on Truth Social, where President Donald Trump posted official word of the conservative activist's death. It illustrated how the “gatekeeping” role of news organizations has changed in the era of social media.

Kirk was shot at a public event before hundreds of people at a Utah college campus, many of them holding up phones to record a celebrity in their midst and savvy about how to disseminate video evidence of a news event.

On X, there was a video showing a direct view of Kirk being shot, his body recoiling and blood gushing from a wound. One video was a loop showing the moment of impact in slow-motion, stopping before blood is seen. Another, taken from Kirk's left, included audio that suggested Kirk was talking about gun violence at the moment he was shot.

For more than 150 years, news organizations like newspapers and television networks have long been accustomed to “gatekeeping” when it comes to explicit content — making editorial decisions around violent events to decide what images and words appear on their platforms for their readers or viewers. But in the fragmented era of social media, smartphones and instant video uploads, editorial decisions by legacy media are less impactful than ever.

Across the country in Ithaca, New York, college professor Sarah Kreps' teenage sons texted her about Kirk's assassination shortly after school was dismissed and they could access their phones.

No, she told them. He was shot, but there were no reports that he had died. Her son answered: Have you seen the video? There's no way he could have survived that.

The videos were posted and reposted at lightning speed. One person on X urged “stop the violence” but then included a clip of the shooting. Several people took to social media to plead for people not to spread the images. “For the love of God and Charlie's family,” read one message, “just stop.”

YouTube said it was removing “some graphic content” related to the event if it doesn't provide sufficient context, and restricting videos so they could not be seen by users under age 18 or those who are not signed in, the company said.

“Our hearts are with Charlie Kirk's family following his tragic death,” YouTube said. “We are closely monitoring our platform and prominently elevating news content on the homepage, in search and in recommendations to help people stay informed.”

Meta's rules don't prohibit posting videos like Kirk's shooting, but warning labels are applied and they are not shown to users who say they are under 18. The parent company of Instagram, Facebook and Threads referred a reporter to the company's policies on violent and graphic content, which they indicated would apply in this case, but had no further comment. An X representative did not immediately return a request for comment.

It's an issue social media companies have dealt with before, in equally gruesome circumstances. Facebook was forced to contend with people wanting to livestream violence with a mass shooting in New Zealand in 2019, said Cornell University's Kreps, author of the forthcoming book, “Harnessing Disruption: Building the Tech Future Without Breaking Society.”

Some images seeped out into more traditional media. TMZ posted a video of Kirk in which a shot and a voice saying, “Oh, my God,” can be heard, but Kirk's upper body was blurred out. A similar video with a blurred image of Kirk was posted on the New York Post's website.

In such an atmosphere, the care shown by most traditional news outlets may seem quaint or old-fashioned. But news industry leaders are acutely aware of protecting people from graphic images when they are not expecting it; happening upon them is a little harder online, where many people have to search for and click on an image if they want to see it — if it hasn't already been sent to you or your group chat.

There can also be an important message sent by news outlets being cautious in what they show, Kreps said. “The traditional media can amplify and validate behavior,” she said. “It can be a signal for how things should be stigmatized, rather than validated or normalized.”

But on the day of the shooting in a politically polarized country, the easy availability of shocking images ran the risk of making society's wound even more painful.

“I don't see how many signs of how we get — as a people, as a nation — to the other side of this,” said CNN's David Chalian. “I think we are broken, and potentially beyond repair.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — In the tragic roll call of violence in American public life, Charlie Kirk's name joins what has fast become a long list.

The influential 31-year old commentator, who cast his young professional life rousing other young people to embrace or debate his brand of conservatism, was slain doing what he does best: holding a provocative question-and-answer session on a college campus.

Kirk had been sparring with a questioner at Utah Valley University over who commits gun violence. Then the shot rang out.

President Donald Trump, a survivor of assassination attempts including at a 2024 campaign rally, announced on social media: Kirk was dead.

“It has to stop,” House Speaker Mike Johnson pleaded from the U.S. Capitol. “This is not who we are.”

Condemnation of the violence came quickly, from all corners and across the political divide, and it was universal. But it has never been enough. Within minutes a shouting match erupted during a moment of silence in the House. One Republican lawmaker wanted an actual prayer for Kirk; Democrats called for changes in gun laws. Online, certain far-right figures responded with anger and pointed blame. And so did Trump.

“We're moving in a very dangerous direction, and I think we have been moving in this direction for quite some time,” said Kurt Braddock, an assistant professor of public communication at American University.

Though nothing is publicly known about the shooter or the motive in this case, Braddock said it can't be ignored that polarization and normalization of violence have become threaded through U.S. politics.




“It's incumbent on both sides to take steps to lower the temperature and make it clear that violence should never be considered an acceptable form of political action,” he said.

The nation's long history of violence in the public realm carries many data points. It has felled presidents, presidential contenders, activists like Kirk and some of the most consequential figures in American civic life — Abraham Lincoln, the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.

Among those who have survived the violence, Trump does not stand alone. Elected officials in the U.S. have been shot at and critically wounded while talking to voters outside a grocery store in Arizona; practicing for a congressional baseball game in Virginia; answering the door to their own home in Minnesota. The governor's house in Pennsylvania was set ablaze as he and his family slept inside. Members of Congress fled the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

“It's time for all Americans and the media to confront the fact that violence and murder are the tragic consequence of demonizing those with whom you disagree day after day, year after year,” said Trump — who then proceeded to blame what he called the “radical left” for the attacks.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)



Bruce Hoffman, a senior fellow for counterterrorism and homeland security at the Council on Foreign Relations, said how the country responds to Kirk's killing will be crucial to what happens next.

“In the past, we had elected officials that would seek to bring the country together rather than to cast blame,” he said. “We'll have to see what in the coming days our national leaders have to say about this, and whether they can be effective in lowering the temperature.”

College campuses where Kirk draws robust and curious crowds to discuss not just politics but their questions about growing into adulthood have often been battlegrounds of ideas and centers of American thought, from the Vietnam War protests at Kent State to the Israel-Hamas war demonstrations of the Trump era.

Conservative commentators in particular have complained of being unfairly blocked from universities as students protested their appearances at college campuses. Trump has turned the force of the U.S. government against Harvard, Columbia and the nation's premier universities to end policies his administration views as too “woke.”

Kirk, a charismatic figure who founded his Turning Point USA as an 18-year-old, grew into an influential leader tapping into the mood of a younger generation's grievances with society. 

A Christian father of two, he demonstrated a combative new approach to conservatism that openly criticized racial justice movements, the news media and LGBTQ rights. Critics said his views perpetuated racist, anti-immigrant and anti-feminist ideas.

Kirk often faced protests and controversy when he visited college campuses, including on his recent tour.

Ahead of Wednesday's event, an online petition calling for the university's administrators to reconsider allowing him to speak received nearly 1,000 signatures. A similar petition at Utah State University, where Kirk was set to appear later in the month, gathered nearly 7,000 signatures.

In Utah, Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, pleaded with Americans to look at themselves, and the way they treat one another, as the nation prepares to celebrate the 250th anniversary of its founding.

“We desperately need leaders in our country, but more than the leaders, we just need every single person in this country to think about where we are and where we want to be,” he said. “Is this what 250 years has wrought on us?”

He prayed that “all of us will try to find a way to stop hating our fellow Americans.”

President Donald Trump suggested that his administration will target “radical-left” groups that funded violence toward Charlie Kirk and other conservative figures, including the president himself.

Trump mourned Kirk, who was shot and killed on Wednesday at a Utah university, in an Oval Office address.

“Charlie was a patriot to my great fellow Americans. I am filled with grief and anger at the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk on a college campus in Utah. Charlie inspired millions, and tonight, all who knew him and loved him are united in shock and horror,” he began his address, later calling him a “martyr for truth and freedom.”

Trump blamed those on the “radical Left” for inflammatory rhetoric that led to Kirk's shooting.

“My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it, as well as those who go after our judges, law enforcement officials, and everyone else who brings order to our country,” he said, going on to reference the assassination attempts against himself and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) and the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

“Radical-left political violence has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives,” Trump added.

There's no evidence to suggest that the shooter was affiliated with a Democratic group. FBI Director Kash Patel initially signaled a suspect was in custody, but later said a person of interest had been released and the shooter was still on the loose.

“The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement. Our investigation continues and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency,” Patel wrote on X.

Little is known about the shooter other than that they fled the campus after the shooting, were wearing dark clothing, and used a long gun to kill Kirk.

Trump said the shooter was “attacking our whole country” by shooting Kirk.

BYRON YORK: WHAT IS JUSTICE IN THE EPSTEIN CASE?

“An assassin tried to silence him with a bullet, but he failed because together we will ensure that his voice, his message, and his legacy will live on for countless generations to come. Today, because of this heinous act, Charlie's voice has become bigger and grander than ever before, and it's not even close,” he concluded.

The president has ordered flags lowered to half-staff until Sunday night to honor Kirk.

Conservative commentator Will Cain observed a moment of silence on his Fox News show after a gunman shot and killed Charlie Kirk on Wednesday.

He said the communications director at Turning Point USA, a conservative organization that he was the executive director of, asked his team to sit in a moment of silence.

“We are going to pause and offer our prayer. We hope you join along,” he said before pausing to bow his head for about 10 seconds.

“However and to whomever you pray, I hope in this moment you can pray for Charlie Kirk,” he added.

Cain's prayer came before it was confirmed that Kirk died of his wounds after being shot while speaking at a Utah Valley University event. The suspect is still on the loose.

The Fox News personality wrote on social media to grieve Kirk's death.

“I can't believe I just had to announce on live TV the death of a friend. I can't believe this is where we are in America. Charlie was a man of God. A Christian. A Patriot. A family man. A husband and father. And a really good man,” he said.

“It says something real that the only rebuttal to stop Charlie was violence. But it won't stop Charlie. Because it won't stop us. You just lifted up Charlie,” he concluded.

TRUMP'S AGENDA CORNERS DEMOCRATIC LEADERS TO EMBRACE STATES' RIGHTS

Many others, Democrats and Republicans, also grieved Kirk's death. Most called for a cooling of political divisions and condemned political violence. 

A moment of silence was also called during a New York Yankees-Detroit Tigers baseball game on Wednesday evening.

Microsoft executives explained why the company is mandating a stricter return-to-office policy during an all-employee town hall on Thursday, citing internal data that showed employees with more in-office time are "thriving."

CEO Satya Nadella said the company observed through the pandemic that an "unintended consequence" of remote work was that social ties are "necessary for innovation," according to internal comments at the town hall, reviewed by Business Insider.

"Weak ties, you know, become weaker, stronger ties become stronger, and new ties are tough to form, right? That's it," Nadella said to employees on Thursday. "If you think of it as a simple network problem, that was the conclusion."

Microsoft HR chief Amy Coleman, who announced the policy on Tuesday, said at the town hall that the decision was supported by internal data.

Microsoft has tracked and analyzed data over the past few years and found that employees who spend at least three days a week in the office have a higher "thriving score," which Coleman explained means that the employee is energized, empowered, and finding meaning in their work. Coleman didn't share how Microsoft determines who is "thriving," but the company frequently surveys employee sentiment.

Seattle-area Microsoft employees already average 2.4 days a week in the office, Coleman said. "So for some, this is not a big change," she said.

Nadella said the company will still allow the opportunity for flexible work, based on the needs of specific teams. For example, Microsoft AI has a stricter policy than the rest of the company, as Business Insider reported earlier this week.

"It doesn't mean that we don't recognize the power of flexible work," Nadella said, adding that different teams will be able to set different terms for in-office work. "There's tons of empowerment here for people to go organize this in such a way that it works for the folks."

Microsoft declined to comment.

Paramount Skydance is working with an investment bank as it prepares an offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, according to people familiar with the matter.

Warner Bros. Discovery had yet to receive an offer as of Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic dealings. A bid could come as early as next week, CNBC's David Faber reported Thursday.

Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery soared more than 25% on Thursday after an initial report from the the Wall Street Journal that the recently merged Paramount Skydance was preparing a takeover bid.

Representatives for Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery declined to comment.

Shares of Paramount Skydance were up roughly 8% in afternoon trading.

Warner Bros. Discovery recently announced plans to separate its global TV networks business from its streaming business and studios. The Journal reported Thursday the Paramount Skydance bid would be an all-cash offer for the entirety of WBD.

Earlier this week, WBD CEO David Zaslav said at an investor conference that the planned separation would likely be completed by April. The streaming and studio assets would be renamed Warner Bros., while the global TV networks business — which will own a suite of pay TV networks including TNT and CNN — will be Discovery Global.

While WBD executives said in June that each company would be "free and clear" to do deals following the split, a bid before the separation would have to be for the entire company, one of the people said.

The media industry has been navigating a transformation as streaming has upended the pay TV bundle, a longtime cash cow for TV and entertainment companies.

A merger between Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. Discovery would create a media behemoth with a huge portfolio of pay TV networks, a sprawling range of sports rights and two major film studios.

Paramount Skydance owns broadcast network CBS, as well as pay TV networks like BET, MTV and Nickelodeon, and streaming service Paramount+. Its film studio is known for movies like "The Godfather," "Top Gun," and "Forrest Gump." 

With the exception of a broadcast TV network, WBD has similar assets — with networks like CNN and TNT, as well as HBO and streaming service HBO Max. Its Warner Bros. film studio also has a historic track record, and owns the intellectual property to franchises like "Harry Potter," DC Comics and "The Lord of the Rings."

Both companies have a long list of major sports rights, too, the marquee content for all traditional TV and streaming platforms. A merger would put the likes of the NFL, MLB, an array of college football and basketball, and other major sports under one roof.

Media executives and experts have expected consolidation could be coming to the industry.

Zaslav has said publicly for some time that media companies need to consolidate. During an earnings call in November, shortly after Donald Trump was elected as president, Zaslav said a new administration could usher in more dealmaking.

However, in recent months, some media companies have moved toward separation. Late last year, Comcast announced that its NBCUniversal would spin off its pay TV networks, which includes CNBC and MSNBC, into a separate, publicly traded entity. Months later, WBD announced it would make the same move.

Paramount Skydance is the result of an $8 billion merger that was announced last year and received regulatory approval in August to move forward after a lengthy delay.

The Federal Communications Commission cleared the way for the merger weeks after Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to Trump to settle a lawsuit he filed against the company over the editing of an interview on CBS's "60 Minutes" with former Vice President Kamala Harris.

At the time of deal's approval, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said in a statement that he welcomed "Skydance's commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network."

The company is looking to cut more than $2 billion in costs, and layoffs are expected to continue. Last week, Paramount SKydance sent a memo to its employees saying they were expected to return to the office five days a week in the new year, or seek a buyout.

A lot has changed since the merger, which was backed by RedBird Capital Partners. The company has done a slew of deals under the leadership of David Ellison, son of Oracle founder and multibillionaire Larry Ellison, including acquiring the U.S. rights to TKO Group's UFC for seven years, beginning in 2026.

On Wednesday, Larry Ellison became more than $100 billion richer after software company Oracle issued growth projections that dramatically lifted the company's stock.

Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC.

The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday announced it is issuing orders to seven companies including OpenAI, Alphabet, Meta, xAI and Snap to understand how their artificial intelligence chatbots potentially negatively affect children and teenagers.

The federal agency said AI chatbots may be used to simulate human-like communication and intrapersonal relationships with users, and that it wants to understand what steps these companies have taken to "evaluate the safety of these chatbots when acting as companions," according to a release.

"Protecting kids online is a top priority for the Trump-Vance FTC, and so is fostering innovation in critical sectors of our economy," FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said in a statement. 

Meta declined to comment on the inquiry. Alphabet, Snap and xAI did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

The FTC said it is seeking information about how these companies monetize user engagement, develop and approve characters, use or share personal information, monitor and enforce compliance with company rules and terms of service and mitigate negative impacts, among other subjects.

"Our priority is making ChatGPT helpful and safe for everyone, and we know safety matters above all else when young people are involved," an OpenAI spokesperson told CNBC in a statement. "We recognize the FTC has open questions and concerns, and we're committed to engaging constructively and responding to them directly."

Character Technologies, which operates the Character.ai bot, and Instagram, which is owned by Meta, were also named in the release. Character did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. 

Since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, a host of chatbots have emerged, creating a growing number of ethical and privacy concerns, as CNBC has previously reported.

The societal impacts of companions are already profound, even with the industry in its very early stages, as the U.S. suffers through a loneliness epidemic. Industry experts have said they expect the ethical and safety concerns to intensify once AI technology begins to train itself, creating the potential for increasingly unpredictable outcomes.

But some of the wealthiest people in the world are touting the power of companions and are working to develop the technology at their companies. Elon Musk in July announced a Companions feature for users who pay to subscribe to xAI's Grok chatbot app. In April, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said people are going to want personalized AI that understands them.

"I think a lot of these things that today there might be a little bit of a stigma around — I would guess that over time, we will find the vocabulary as a society to be able to articulate why that is valuable and why the people who are doing these things, why they are rational for doing it, and how it is actually adding value for their lives," Zuckerberg said on a podcast.

Last month, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., announced an investigation into Meta following a Reuters report that the company allowed its chatbots to have romantic and sensual conversation with kids. 

The Reuters report detailed an internal Meta document that described permissible AI chatbot behaviors during the development and training of the software. In one example, Reuters reported that a chatbot was allowed to have a romantic conversation with an eight-year-old and could say that "every inch of you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply."

Meta made temporary changes to its AI chatbot policies following the Reuters report so the bots do not discuss subjects like self-harm, suicide, eating disorders and avoiding potentially inappropriate romantic conversations.

Similarly, OpenAI outlined its plans to address how ChatGPT will handle "sensitive situations" last month after a lawsuit from a family blamed the chatbot for their teenage son's death by suicide.

Lina Khan, the former chair of the Federal Trade Commission, told a roomful of founders and investors that poaching talent in billion-dollar deals still amounts to an acquisition by another name — and it could someday meet the same scrutiny as blockbuster mergers.

"If these acqui-hires are being done in a way that is ultimately having a bad effect on competition, that is something that enforcers should be able to look at, and they should be looking at," she said during a talk at NYC Summit, an annual gathering of tech builders and investors hosted by the early-stage venture firm Primary.

Big Tech isn't buying startups at the rate it used to. Lately, it's strip-mining them.

Meta hired Scale AI's Alexandr Wang after investing $14.3 billion in the data labeling startup. Google picked off Windsurf's chief executive and top researchers for a $2.4 billion licensing fee. Microsoft gutted Inflection, Amazon raided Adept, and so on. The deals appear to share a common goal: close quickly and dodge watchdogs.

Khan made clear in New York that regulators aren't fooled. "If it is an effort to get around competition laws," she said, "it's definitely something they should be able to reach."

In May, the Justice Department said it was investigating whether Google violated antitrust laws through a pseudo-acquisition of Character.AI, a popular chatbot company. One year earlier, the FTC opened a probe into a Microsoft deal to hire Inflection's cofounder and almost all of its employees.

Such deals could also gain more scrutiny in Europe. In an interview with Reuters last month, the outgoing head of the European Commission's antitrust unit said it had urged member states to flag deals to hire key people, not acquire the company, to the group for review.

In this article

Alphabet's health tech subsidiary Verily used the health data of more than 25,000 patients without authorization and actively covered up those violations, a former company executive alleges. 

The executive, Ryan Sloan, claims Verily fired him after he discovered breaches of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and reported his concerns to the company's senior management.

Patient data in the U.S. is protected under HIPAA, which ensures the sensitive information cannot be disclosed without a patient's consent.

Sloan's allegations are detailed in a pending lawsuit in federal court in San Francisco. The suit, which was filed late last year, has not been previously reported.

On Monday, the judge overseeing Sloan's case denied a request by Verily to dismiss his civil complaint, or to send the dispute to arbitration.

"Verily believes the allegations and contentions alleged in this employment matter that was commenced in 2023 are completely without merit. Verily will defend itself to the full extent of the law," a company spokesperson told CNBC in a statement. "Verily is an equal opportunity employer, and takes its responsibility and commitment to abide by all laws and regulations seriously.  As this is an ongoing legal matter, Verily will not be providing further comment at this time."

Representatives for Sloan did not comment.

Verily started as a moon shot in 2015 within Alphabet's innovation lab X, formerly known as Google X. It's Google's sister company and operates under Alphabet's "Other Bets" category.

The company hired Sloan in 2020 to serve as the chief commercial officer of its diabetes and hypertension business, Verily Onduo.

In January 2022, Sloan alleged that he and Julia Feldman, Onduo's general counsel, discovered Verily had improperly used patients' protected health information in its research, marketing campaigns, press releases and national conferences. The "extensive violations" affected more than 25,000 patients in Onduo's diabetes program, according to an amended complaint filed in June. 

Sloan and Feldman informed senior Verily leaders of their findings, the filing said, and they repeatedly raised the issue. An internal investigation at Verily confirmed several HIPAA breaches took place, according to the filing.

"Between January and March of 2022, internal investigators at Verily confirmed multiple breaches of fourteen (14) separate HIPAA Business Associate Agreements with large, covered entity clients of Onduo between 2017 and 2021," the filing said.

Patients who accessed Verily Onduo through these clients – which include Walgreens Boots Alliance, Highmark Health, Quest Diagnostics and Delta Air Lines, among others – may have been affected by the breaches. 

Delta said in a statement that it doesn't have a comment on the suit, "but our employee's personal information is important to us."

"We are looking into this and will make sure any impact to our people is appropriately addressed," the company said.

Quest said in a statement that, "We are not familiar with the allegations and have no further comment."

Highmark declined to comment. Walgreens did not respond to CNBC's requests for comment.

Under HIPAA, companies like Verily are supposed to notify impacted parties no later than 60 days after discovering a breach. Verily "decided to delay the decision of notifying the covered entities," according to the filing, and the company engaged in negotiations to renew many of those contracts "without revealing that a HIPAA breach had recently occurred." 

"During a contract negotiation between Verily and Highmark Health in August of 2022, Verily represented that it was in compliance with HIPAA at all times, while knowingly concealing that a HIPAA breach had occurred," the filing said. 

That same month, Verily terminated Feldman and another employee who was aware of the breaches.

When Sloan reiterated his concerns about the breaches to Lisa Greenbaum, Verily's then chief revenue officer, in October 2022, she allegedly defended the company's decision not to disclose them and said that doing so would negatively affect public relations, the filing said.

Greenbaum joined Doximity, another health-care technology company, as chief commercial officer in January 2024, according to her LinkedIn. 

Doximity did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

In November 2022, Verily allegedly suppressed a press release out of concern that it would draw attention to previous marketing studies that violated its HIPAA Business Associate Agreements. The company removed the press release from its website and instructed employees not to mention it again, according to the filing. 

Sloan was officially terminated from Verily in January of 2023, while on protected leave to care for his "critically ill mother," the filing said. 

The lawsuit marks the latest in a series of stumbles at Verily, which, despite raising more than $1 billion from investors, has struggled to latch onto a winning product. Verily is reportedly transitioning from a limited liability company, or an LLC, to an investor-friendly C-Corp structure to prepare for a fresh round of funding, according to a report from Business Insider on Wednesday.

Verily originally developed hardware like continuous glucose monitors before pivoting to pandemic response when Covid-19 broke out in 2020, then switched directions again to focus on precision health in 2022. 

The company introduced a new artificial intelligence-powered chronic-care solution called Verily Lightpath last year, and announced it was selling its stop-loss insurance subsidiary, Granular Insurance Co., in February.

President Donald Trump told CNBC on Thursday that he believes "the country will heal" in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination.

CNBC's Joe Kernen said Trump lamented Kirk's death in a phone call, describing himself as "devastated." Kernen said Trump told him Kirk helped him win the 2024 presidential election and that he thought Kirk himself could've one day been president.

"Then he went on to say, 'The country will heal,'" Kernen said, recounting the call. "He's focused on what he has been focused on. And he says, 'I'm focused on winning. If the country wins, and if I do everything I can to help the country win, then we're all going to be able to come together again.'"

Kirk, the co-founder of conservative political organization Turning Point USA and a prominent Trump ally, was fatally shot on Wednesday while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem.

The search for his killer remains ongoing. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, law enforcement officials said they recovered the rifle used to kill Kirk, as well as a footprint and palm print of the shooter.

The shooter "appears to be of college age," Utah Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason said. He also said authorities have "good video footage" of the individual.

The Utah Department of Public Safety initially detained two people on Wednesday before releasing them because they had no connection to the shooting.

Trump on Wednesday ordered American flags to be lowered to half-staff until sunset on Sunday in Kirk's honor.

"No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us. Melania and my Sympathies go out to his beautiful wife Erika, and family. Charlie, we love you!" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Wednesday.

Offshore wind has no future as a source of electricity generation in the U.S. under the Trump administration, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said at an energy conference in Italy this week.

"Under this administration, there is not a future for offshore wind because it is too expensive and not reliable enough," Burgum told an audience at the Gastech conference in Milan on Wednesday.

It is the clearest statement yet from a senior Trump administration official that the president aims to shut down the nascent offshore wind industry in the U.S. Burgum oversees the leasing and permitting of offshore wind farms in federal waters as head of the Department of the Interior.

President Donald Trump barred new leases for offshore wind farms on his first day in office through an executive order that was framed as "temporary." Trump also ordered a review of permits, but the industry had hoped projects under construction would be allowed to move forward.

But the Department of the Interior is "taking a deep look" at five offshore wind farms that are already under construction in the U.S., Burgum said Wednesday without naming the projects.

The offshore wind farms under construction are Revolution Wind off Rhode Island; Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts; Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind; Sunrise Wind off New York; and Empire Wind also off New York.

"Yes, they were permitted but they got moved through a very fast ideologically driven permitting process," Burgum said at the conference in Italy.

The Department of the Interior ordered Danish renewable energy company Orsted to halt construction of Revolution Wind on Aug. 22, citing national security concerns. The project is fully permitted and 80% complete with billions of dollars invested, according to Orsted.

The Department of the Interior had issued a stop-work order for Empire Wind in April, but ultimately let the project resume construction in May after apparently striking a deal over new natural gas capacity.

Burgum told CNBC's Brian Sullivan this week that the Trump administration is in discussions with Orsted and New England governors on Revolution Wind, though he wouldn't say that the project might restart work.

"I can't say for certain because some of these projects are a literal train wreck in terms of their economics," Burgum told CNBC. "If we were to complete them then we're just locking in billions and billions of taxpayer money which might be going to a hedge fund."

Renewable energy executives told CNBC in August that the Trump administration's attacks on solar and wind will lead to a power crunch that increases electricity prices.

The FBI on Thursday released two photos of a person of interest in the shooting of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk.

The grainy photos show a person wearing a black long-sleeve shirt, dark pants, sunglasses and a hat.

"We are asking for the public's help identifying this person of interest in connection with the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University," the FBI's Salt Lake City field office said in an X post with the photos.

The FBI said later Thursday that it is offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information that leads to the identification and arrest of those responsible.

The new information and reward offer came hours after law enforcement officials said they have recovered key evidence in Kirk's assassination at an event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday, including a rifle and "good video footage."

The "high powered, bolt-action rifle" was found in a wooded area where the gunman fled after shooting Kirk, FBI agent Robert Bohls said at a press conference.

Investigators have also collected a "footwear impression, a palm print and forearm imprints for analysis," Bohls, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Salt Lake City field office, said.

He noted, "We're not sure how far he has gone yet."

Utah Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason said, "We do have good video footage of this individual."

But "we are not going to release that at this time," unless authorities fail to identify the shooter on their own, he said.

While officers at the news conference declined to offer specific details about the suspect, Mason said the gunman "blended in well with the college" and "appears to be of college age."

Mason said that the shooter arrived on campus shortly before noon local time, then climbed up to a rooftop overlooking the location of Kirk's event. After the shooting, the suspect moved to the other side of the building, then jumped off and fled into an off-campus neighborhood, he said.

The presser at the university on Thursday morning came after officials released two people of interest several who had been detained shortly after the shooting.

"There are no current ties to the shooting with either of these individuals," the Utah Department of Public Safety said in an update late Wednesday.

"There is an ongoing investigation and manhunt for the shooter," the agency said.

The gunman fired at Kirk from a campus building 200 yards away from where the activist was speaking, hitting him once in the neck, according to UVU.

Kirk's death was announced by President Donald Trump, who praised the influential activist as a "truly Great American Patriot."

On Thursday morning, Trump, at an observance of the 24th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, said he would posthumously award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

The European Central Bank held interest rates steady on Thursday as economic uncertainty persists in the wake of U.S. Donald Trump's aggressive tariff agenda.

Ahead of the decision, markets had been pricing in an around 99% chance of the ECB's key deposit facility rate being left at 2% for the second consecutive time. The central bank last cut rates in June, bringing rates further down from last year's record high of 4%.

"Inflation is currently at around the 2% medium-term target and the Governing Council's assessment of the inflation outlook is broadly unchanged," the ECB said in a statement.

The central bank added that it would follow a meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent approach and was not pre-committing to a specific path for interest rates. The ECB offered little indication on the future direction for rates.

The ECB is grappling with global economic uncertainty, despite inflation in the euro zone hovering around the central bank's 2% target in recent months, and the EU striking a trade agreement with the U.S.

The transatlantic partners agreed to 15% blanket tariffs on EU exports to the U.S. in July, with further details about the framework emerging last month. It addressed some questions for key European sectors like pharmaceuticals.

However, questions remain as some issues — such as provisions for the wine and spirits sector — were left open. Concerns over further tariffs have also grown following Trump's threat of retaliations against the EU after it hit Alphabet's Google with a $3.45 billion antitrust fine.

Fears about the impact tariffs could have on economic growth remain. Growth in the euro zone has remained sluggish even as rates have come down, with the latest figures showing just 0.1% growth in the second quarter after a 0.6% expansion in the previous period.

Lagarde on Thursday noted that "risks to economic growth have become more balanced."

"While recent trade agreements have reduced uncertainty, a renewed worsening of trade relations could further dampen exports and drag down investment and consumption," she said. Lagarde also noted that "the outlook for inflation remains more uncertain than usual as a result of the still volatile trade policy environment."

In response to a question from CNBC's Annette Weisbach, Lagarde added that trade uncertainty had "clearly diminished" as risks like European retaliation against U.S. policy have diminished. But, Lagarde said, uncertainty has not returned to "normal", pre-Covid levels, adding that "maybe there will not be a normal level."

Economists and analysts appeared divided on whether to expect more rate cuts looking ahead.

Based on economic expectations, the central bank "is in no hurry to reduce rates further," said Thomas Pugh, chief economist at consulting firm RSM.

But, he noted, "the 15% tariff on EU exports to the U.S. along with heightened uncertainty will weigh on demand, potentially leaving the door open to a further rate cut at the end of the year."

"A combination of a hit to investment and exports, a stronger euro along with cheaper imports from China could dampen growth and inflation by enough to warrant another rate cut later this year," Pugh explained in a note.

Elsewhere, Irene Lauro, euro zone economist at Schroders, said that Thursday's announcements "confirm our view that the easing cycle has ended."

Lauro sees trade uncertainty fading and the euro zone's economic recovery accelerating as companies become less cautious and labor markets continue to be tight.

"Risks have shifted for the eurozone from trade uncertainty to political instability, with France now in the fiscal spotlight. But the resilience of the economy and strengthening domestic demand means the ECB can afford to keep monetary policy unchanged," she said.

With the interest rate decision itself being widely anticipated, attention on Thursday focused on Lagarde's press conference and the latest projections for inflation and economic growth. The central bank last updated its economic forecasts in June.

"The new ECB staff projections present a picture of inflation similar to that projected in June. They see headline inflation averaging 2.1% in 2025, 1.7% in 2026 and 1.9% in 2027," the central bank said.

In June, headline inflation was forecast to average 2% this year, 1.6% next year and 2% in 2027.

So-called core inflation, which strips out food and energy costs, is expected to average 2.4% this year, unchanged from the previous estimate.

Looking at economic growth, the ECB said that "the economy is projected to grow by 1.2% in 2025, revised up from the 0.9% expected in June."

The forecast for 2026 was trimmed slightly to 1% growth.

Klarna employees are about to get a big payday — and it could come sooner than expected.

The Swedish fintech company is giving employees a rare chance to cash out their equity during the IPO window, Business Insider has learned.

In an email to current and former staff on Wednesday, the company said it is converting vested restricted stock units, or RSUs, into tradable shares, which employees can begin selling a few days after the $15 billion IPO. The email, seen by Business Insider, said that the converted shares are "exempt from the six-month post-IPO lockup and can be traded during this time."

Klarna didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Exemptions like this are rare in public offerings, but not unheard of. When Airbnb went public in 2020, it gave employees the chance to sell up to 15% of their holdings in the first week of trading. Usually, IPOs come with lockup periods that bar insiders from selling shares for about six months. The measure is intended to keep insiders and early investors from unloading shares right as the company opens up to public buyers.

Klarna's email also detailed the conversion rate: roughly four RSUs will equal one publicly tradable share. Current employees will be allowed to sell during the initial IPO window until September 30; after that, trading will be limited to quarterly windows.

Stock awards, such as RSU grants, have long been a key part of compensation in the tech industry, adding to base salaries and bonuses to make up total earnings.

Klarna does not specify in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission what portion of the ordinary shares it is offering will be sold by employees.

Klarna, which provides buy now, pay later financing to consumers, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Its shares surged to $52 at the open, a 30% premium to their listing price of $40. They retreated after that initial pop, closing the day 15% higher than its open at just under $46.

The IPO valued Klarna at about $15 billion, far below its 2021 peak of $45.6 billion. The company has been eyeing an IPO for years. Its plan to debut in April was pushed back after US tariff announcements caused market volatility.

The listing has provided returns of more than $1 billion each to investors Sequoia Capital and Heartland A/S. At Wednesday's market close, the shares of Klarna cofounders Sebastian Siemiatkowski and Victor Jacobsson were also worth more than $1 billion each.

Even Serena Williams doesn't get a free pass, in a funding climate where startups are picky about whose money they'll take.

The tennis legend has built Serena Ventures into a $111 million fund that claims stakes in 16 unicorns, or startups valued at more than $1 billion. Her name will almost always get her in the room, but winning the deal is another matter.

"Founders," she says, "are getting more choosy."

On Wednesday, Williams and Beth Ferreira, a Serena Ventures general partner, headlined NYC Summit, a staple of conference season for two thousand tech builders and investors, hosted by early-stage venture firm Primary. This year's lineup featured former FTC chair Lina Khan, policy-savvy venture capitalist Bradley Tusk, and the founders of leading artificial intelligence startups, including Decagon, Clay, and Cohere.

Tech has always been a game of haves and have-nots, but the divide is starker as big acquirers pull back, venture firms raise smaller funds at a slower clip, and most dollars chase artificial intelligence. For everyone else, cash is harder to come by — and founders are weighing more carefully whether an investor brings more than money to the table.

"Founders," Ferreira said, "are really evaluating who they want to partner with. If they don't believe that our network and the ideas we have about their company can change outcomes, we're not going to get into the deal."

"I think most of the time," she added, "those founders are realizing that this is different and could very much complement the rest of their investment base."

That choosiness goes for investors, too.

Ferreira says the firm comes in early, takes modest positions, and doubles down only when portfolio companies show breakout potential. In some cases, she added, the fund has even approached portfolio startups valued in the billions to cash out some of their shares.

Williams said the firm is cutting fewer checks than it did three or four years ago, reflecting today's more cautious market. Serena Ventures now digs deeper into each startup, pressing on whether founders are genuinely solving the problem they set out to address.

That extra scrutiny, she added, is a healthy shift — forcing both investors and founders to be more strategic about where dollars go. "Not all money is good money," Williams said.

Since taking a step back from tennis, Williams has grown a business empire that stretches from cosmetics and media to stakes in pro sports teams. In 2022, she added venture capitalist to her list of titles, launching her fund that invests in consumer brands and software.

Williams doesn't seem eager to take any credit. In an X post on Monday, she called a news headline "inaccurate" for saying she personally invested in a women's basketball league, clarifying that the move came from her fund. "I remain a partner at Serena Ventures, not in an operational role," she wrote.

If Williams is the name on the marquee, Ferreira is the hand at the wheel. A former operator, she leads a team of four investors at the firm, sourcing deals and managing the portfolio. Her previous bets include Glossier, Warby Parker, Daily Harvest, and MasterClass.

Looking ahead, Williams said Serena Ventures still has capital left from its $111 million debut fund. Asked whether a second fund was on the horizon, she hedged, joking that she'd need to "check with the lawyers" before saying more.

Williams made one thing clear: the firm isn't a one-and-done experiment. "We are not here to do one fund," she said.

Wall Street is beginning to worry that, for some troubled users, AI chatbots and models may exacerbate mental health problems.

There's even a phrase for it now: "psychosis risk."

"Recent heartbreaking cases of people using ChatGPT in the midst of acute crises weigh heavily on us," OpenAI said in a recent statement, after being sued by a family that blamed the chatbot for their 16-year-old son's April death by suicide.

"We're continuing to improve how our models recognize and respond to signs of mental and emotional distress and connect people with care, guided by expert input," the company added. 

This week, Barclays analysts highlighted a recent study by researcher Tim Hua that attempted to rate which AI models were better, and worse, at handling these delicate situations. The findings reveal stark differences between models that mitigate risks and those that amplify them. In general, the study left the analysts concerned.

"There is still more work that needs to be done to ensure that models are safe for users to use, and guardrails will hopefully be put in place, over time, to make sure that harmful behavior isn't encouraged," the Barclays analysts wrote in a note to investors on Monday.

When evaluating whether models direct users toward medical help, OpenAI's gpt-oss-20b and GPT-5 stood out, with 89% and 82% of responses urging professional support. Anthropic's Claude-4-Sonnet followed closely behind.

DeepSeek was at the bottom. Only 5% of responses from Deepseek-chat (v3) encouraged seeking medical help.

These AI models were scored based on how much they pushed back against users. A relatively new open-source model, called kimi-k2, came top, while DeepSeek-chat (v3) came last, according to the study.

The study also looked at whether AI models encouraged delusions. Here, DeepSeek-chat (v3) came top, suggesting it encouraged more delusions. Kimi-k2 ranked at the bottom implying better performance on this assessment.

Finally, the study assessed AI models based on a composite of nine therapeutic-style metrics, including fostering real-world connections and gentle reality testing.

Claude-4-Sonnet and GPT-5 ranked at the top, with overall ratings at or near 4.5 out of 5.

The worst offenders were models and chatbots from DeepSeek, according to the study.

As AI systems become embedded in daily life, mitigating "psychosis risk" may prove as critical as ensuring accuracy, data privacy, or cybersecurity.

(If you're struggling with mental health issues, reach out to a trusted friend or colleague, or human experts such as a doctor or therapist).

Anthropic declined to comment. DeepSeek, Google, and OpenAI didn't respond to requests for comment.

Still, it's a little wild to realize that upward of 50 million Americans willingly use a device each year that was conceptualized to make criminals suffer. A lot of people are gluttons for punishment, though.

Exercise fads constantly come and go. In 2025, that means spin classes are out, Pilates and strength training are in, and the Thighmaster is probably sitting somewhere in your great aunt's basement. Americans tend to treat fitness as a consumer product to be used and, once we get bored or something better comes along, tossed aside. Yes, exercise science evolves, and doctors' recommendations on the best ways to stay fit change over time, but not nearly as fast as whatever Hot New Thing the cool kids are into cycles through.

If there is an exception to the fadification of fitness, it is the humble treadmill. Both literally and figuratively, it doesn't go anywhere.

Data from the Sports & Fitness Industry Association, a trade association for the sporting goods industry, shows 56.8 million Americans used a treadmill in 2024. That is a … 0% change from 2019. People use the treadmill at about the same rates as they jog or lift free weights. The only sporting activity that's more popular is walking.

"We've been tracking participation trends for 38 years, and in the current iteration, we've been tracking it since 2008, and treadmill has always been one of the most participated sports," says Alex Kerman, the senior director of business operations and research at SFIA.

According to SFIA's research, 18.4% of the US population ages 6 and up use a treadmill at least once a year, a small uptick from 17.2% in 2014. Treadmill use cuts across ages, demographics, geographies, and income levels, though it tends to skew female, higher-income, college-educated, and white. Given their mainstay status, it's perhaps not a surprise that treadmills are the most lucrative piece of gym and exercise equipment in the US, generating about $1.1 billion in revenue in 2025, according to data from IBISWorld.

"The treadmill endures because it really delivers on the essential basics: accessibility, convenience, and proven effectiveness," says Cedric Bryant, the president and CEO of the American Council on Exercise. "The most basic element to maintaining an independent lifestyle, typically, as we mature, is to be able to ambulate and move on our own. Treadmills help to maintain that quality."

The treadmill's hold on our society started in the late 1960s and 1970s. Aerobic fitness started to take off as people realized and publicized the cardiovascular benefits of moving and shaking. Jogging took off as an easy, cheap way to get your heart rate up. While plenty of people partake in outdoor running and walking, others prefer to do it inside.

"The treadmill sticks around because running and jogging stick around," says Natalia Mehlman Petrzela, a history professor at The New School who's the author of "Fit Nation: The Gains and Pains of America's Exercise Obsession." "Most people can put one foot in front of the other and walk or jog, and it's that much easier to not have to deal with the elements or the time of day."

Treadmills are versatile — they can be used by beginners starting out walking or more advanced athletes doing interval training and playing around with elevation. A treadmill can be a place to do a little (careful) multitasking. In terms of improving cardiovascular health, increasing endurance, and helping with weight management, it delivers bang for your buck, whether at the gym or in your basement.

"There's millions of people that have health club memberships, and the treadmill is right there, free to use," Kerman says. "They've made models now that are affordable for at-home purchase as well."

Treadmills can deliver the mental health benefits of exercise, be a space for zoning out or getting in a good think, though the endeavor can, admittedly, be pretty boring. Luckily, treadmill technology has improved, so maybe that device that wasn't for you 10 years ago would be now. Many of them have TVs, and some offer interactive classes. A lot of modern-day treadmills also have less of that "might fall off of them with any wrong move" feeling.

"We pay big bucks for fancy connected treadmills," Mehlman Petrzela says. "As we want more out of our workouts, we want more out of less time. Running is both old school and basic, but it's kind of hard to beat that."

Of course, exercise trends have come for the treadmill, too. There's the 12-3-30 "hot girl" workout that's popular among a certain type of, well, hot girl, or the Zone 2 cardio focus. Boutique studios such as Barry's and Orangetheory also incorporate pretty tough treadmill work.

Carmine Ciliento, a fitness manager at Crunch Fitness, tells me he's not always in love with some of the treadmill-based workout trends that come from social media influencers. "If the person looks the part and talks in a convincing way, people will be like, 'All right, let me try that," he says. The 12-3-30, where you walk 3 miles per hour at a 12% incline for 30 minutes, has a "very arbitrary rationale," he says, and while Zone 2, a moderate-intensity workout, has become popular, it's not a "magic pill" either.

But if an influencer or some flash-in-the-pan fad gets people to move, so be it, Bryant says. "That can generate even more interest and excitement around this product that's been around forever," he says. There is research to support the benefits of the 12-3-30.

Ciliento himself got into running in 2019 and mainly uses the treadmill for tempo work, but he understands that running may not be for everyone. It generates a lot of impact, which can be tough on joints and could increase the risk of injury, and many Americans, especially those who didn't play sports growing up, mainly remember dreading that timed mile in high school gym class.

"As much as I've invested my time into running over the last couple of years, I don't tell people they need to run," Ciliento says. "That being said, the more resilient someone becomes physically, emotionally, and mentally, the more you could kind of start to reintroduce things that they might've strayed away from at one point or another."

Fitness crazes tend to grab the headlines and, for some of the fitness fiends out there, their hearts and wallets. Tae Bo, Jazzercise, and hula hooping are just some of the once hot modalities that have fallen by the wayside. It's tempting to laugh at how weird some of them were, but the fact of the matter is, the best exercise is the one you'll keep coming back to. If it takes a Zumba class to get you moving, or if you fall back in love with that Gazelle machine, whatever. The problem is, a lot of these fads are not ones people stick with once the novelty wears off.

The treadmill is, for many people, a consistent friend. It's simple, familiar, and incorporates movements we evolved to do. Sure, it's not the most entertaining piece of exercise equipment in the world. But maybe that's part of its lasting appeal: It wasn't designed to be fun in the first place.

Tom and Jeanne Skellan were homeowners for more than 40 years before they decided to become renters again.

As they both neared their 70s, their kids wanted them to leave St. George, Utah, where they'd moved after decades in Philadelphia, and live closer to family. So in 2021, the Skellans sold their home of 15 years and headed south to Mesa, Arizona, settling minutes away from one of their three sons and his family.

Despite having enough cash from their home sale for a down payment on a new place, the couple decided they didn't want to sign up again for all the responsibilities that come with homeownership. Instead, they moved into a single-story three-bedroom rental house.

The Skellans' decision to rent in retirement is increasingly common. A growing number of older Americans rent their homes for financial reasons, flexibility, and, in some cases, amenities and community.

The $2,100 monthly rent the couple pays in Mesa is a few hundred dollars more than their mortgage was in St. George, but they're relieved they don't have to do yard work, fix the air conditioning, or worry about rising property taxes and home insurance premiums. And they have the flexibility to move if their son leaves the area or if they want a change.

"If we bought a house, we couldn't afford a new one, so we'd end up getting an older one, and there might be a decent amount of expenses," said Tom, who's turning 75 in late September.

With elevated mortgage rates and soaring home prices, renting is increasingly cheaper than buying. Plus, they might not live long enough to see their home value appreciate much or pay off their mortgage. "I'm not going to last 30 years, so I'm just thinking 12 to 15 years," he said. "By the time the house gets appreciated, we'll be dead."

Instead, they're using some of the money they would have spent on a down payment to travel. They spent three weeks in Ireland, Saratoga Springs, and the Ozarks this summer, and they're planning a big trip to Italy for their 50th anniversary next year.

The number of people 65 or older who rent their homes grew by nearly 30% to around 10.4 million between 2013 and 2023, according to a recent Point2Homes study of US Census data. The only other age group with a growing number of renters was people between 55 and 64. Sunbelt destinations, like Arizona, have seen a disproportionate share of the growth with older renters, the report found.

The growth in renters speaks to the challenges of downsizing as a homeowner. With mortgage rates and housing costs high and inventory scarce, many older people are struggling to find affordable and accessible starter homes to buy. Eight in 10 baby boomer renters said renting was a better deal than buying, according to a 2024 Bank of America survey. Many older Americans are turning to rentals, including in 55-plus and retirement communities.

The rental communities are "a really hot part of the senior housing market right now that's grown a lot in the last several years," said Tim Mullaney, editorial director of the trade publication Senior Housing News.

Unlike many older renters, the Skellans feel financially comfortable. Jeanne is fully retired, while Tom is semi-retired and owns a small business doing reserve studies for homeowners' associations. He also collects a pension of about $2,200 a month from his career as an accountant and IT systems manager for Delaware County, Pennsylvania, for 30 years. The couple both receive Social Security benefits, which amount to more than $3,300 monthly, combined.

While people like the Skellans were able to cash in on a booming housing market and are choosing to rent in part for convenience, many older Americans rent because they don't have the option to buy.

About a third of 65-and-older households were cost-burdened in 2023, meaning they spent more than 30% of their income on housing, according to a recent report from Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies. And older renters are notably worse off than homeowners — 58% were cost-burdened in 2023, most of them severely, the report found.

The Skellans feel fortunate to have found their home and hope to stay for the foreseeable future.

"The only concern you have when you rent is, hopefully, that you're going to be there for a while and you're not going to have to pick up and move again," Tom said.

Monday - Friday, 11:00 - 12:00 SIN/HK  |  0500 - 06:00 CET

Hello, I am Priyanka Salve, CNBC's senior correspondent for India, writing from Singapore. This week, I look at how global and local electric car makers are betting on the world's third-largest car market in hopes of capturing the attention — and wallet share — of the Indian middle class.

This report is from this week's edition of CNBC's "Inside India" newsletter which brings you news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse. You can subscribe here.

For years now, India's auto market has been a cozy little clique of Japanese, Korean and Indian companies, with the top six carmakers holding more than 90% of the market, catering to local consumers' mostly utilitarian preferences.

The entry of electric vehicles, however, could shake things up — disrupt the industry and ruffle the pecking order.

Global electric vehicle giants are making moves in India, driving old market players to learn new tricks, and the Indian middle class is left wondering: could my next SUV be electric?

Take Tesla, Elon Musk's car company last week delivered its first electric SUV, Model Y, from its showroom in Mumbai. But priced at a whopping 6 million Indian rupees ($68,094) it is firmly positioned as a "dream" car for most of the country's middle class.

As dreams are often tricky to realize, it was not surprising that Tesla reportedly received just 600 orders since it opened up shop in July.

Global EV market disruptor, China's BYD, crossed 10,000 deliveries in India earlier this month, having started selling cars in the country in 2022. All four of BYD's EV models for sale in the country hover toward the higher end of 3-million-rupee price point or beyond.

India's top-selling mid-sized conventional SUV, Hyundai Creta, comes at starting price of 1.1 million Indian rupees and goes up to 2.1 million. It sold 186,919 units in 2024 alone.

Foreign carmakers need to set up local manufacturing to build scale and launch their affordable range of cars as duties on imported cars can go up to 110%, plus there's an annual import cap of 2,500 units per company.

While scalability remains a challenge for Tesla and BYD as both import vehicles, it's a different story for Vietnam's VinFast.

VinFast on Saturday rolled out its VF6 and VF7 models priced between 1.7 million rupees and about 2.3 million rupees, with those cars being assembled in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

Auto analysts say that from a pricing perspective this hits the sweet spot for consumers as many popular internal combustion engine mid-sized SUVs fall in that price band, including Hyundai's Creta.

Still, Indian car companies have the cheapest EV offerings, starting at as low as 1 million rupees. "Currently Tata Motors is the largest EV player in the country with around 40% market share, followed by JSW MG Motor at 30% and Mahindra & Mahindra at 21%-22% share," according to Macquarie Capital.

The key to keeping prices low is local production, and foreign players are recognizing that. VinFast's local manufacturing ability, for instance, is what allows it to make cars at scale and price them attractively compared with other overseas players.

"By optimizing production, making smart design choices, and prioritizing the features that matter most for everyday driving, we're able to keep prices closer to what customers truly want," Pham Sanh Chau, CEO, VinFast Asia, told CNBC.

BYD had similar plans, but it ran into roadblocks after India's Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal earlier this year rejected the company's offer to invest.

On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that BYD's senior management will visit India seeking to expand operations in the country. The company plans to launch its Atto 2 model in the country, priced at under 2 million rupees, the report said.

"BYD has been a disruptor in every market it has entered globally, and India does not want that to happen to its EV market," an auto analyst at a domestic brokerage said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the topic.

Tesla, meanwhile, was being courted by the Indian government ever since Musk announced his plans to enter the electric car market. But reports in June quoting an Indian official said the company was "not interested" in producing cars in India.

Given tensions between the U.S and India, and changing, albeit strained relations between New Delhi with Beijing, securing investment from Tesla or approving those from BYD look unlikely in the near term.

Meanwhile, the country's old guard is preparing to launch more EV products.

Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai have plans to launch more EV models, with Jain saying that the newer products will support EV adoption across a wider segment of consumers.

EVs are still a tiny slice of India's car market, with a penetration of just 5.3% as of August 2025, according to data from the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations.

Compare that to the share of China's battery electric vehicles at 27% of the auto market, and both the potential and the challenges of India's market become starkly visible.

For real growth to happen, one critical piece needs to fall into place: the public charging infrastructure.

Consumers currently face "range anxiety" while buying EVs due to fewer public charging points.

"The fuel stations are almost four times of the charging stations that we have for the electric vehicles," said Saket Mehra, partner, and auto and EV industry leader at Grant Thornton Bharat.

Lack of adequate infrastructure restricts EVs to high-net-worth consumers because they have greater accessibility to private charging facilities. "They can put a charging infrastructure at their houses, because most of the HNIs and ultra HNI live in individual houses rather than apartments," said Mehra.

Nevertheless, while public charging infrastructure is not adequate, it is improving. According to Indian government's public policy think tank, Niti Aayog, there 14 cars per charging station, compared to nine cars per charging station in China.

According to report by Indian data provider CareEdge, public EV charging stations have risen from 5,151 in 2022 to 26,367 in mid-2024.

The buzz around the EV industry with new challengers entering the market could usher in a new chapter in India's auto history.

In the late-90s, when Hyundai entered India, Maruti Suzuki was the undisputed carmaker. Few believed that a locally unknown player could pose a serious challenge. But after Hyundai launched Santro — a quirky looking hatchback, priced right in the comfort zone of middle-class India — there was no looking back. Today it is the second biggest car company in India.

Which carmaker can be the next Hyundai for EVs in India? We are tracking the market closely and will keep you updated.

Trump on Sept. 9 wrote on Truth Social that "India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations." Catch CNBC's Megan Cassella on the latest trade discussions between the U.S. and India.

Kiranjeet Kaur, associate research director at IDC Asia Pacific, explained that U.S. tariffs accelerated Apple's decision to shift production to India from China to avoid increased costs.

Alok Saigal, president and head of Nuvama Private, explained that Singapore and Dubai are extremely friendly to family offices and provide gateways to other regions.

U.S. President Donald Trump asked the European Union to impose 100% tariffs on India and China. Trump made that request, which is aimed at pressurizing Russia to end its war in Ukraine, in a meeting with senior U.S. and EU officials, two sources confirmed to CNBC's Megan Cassella. India is one of the biggest buyers of Russian oil.

India urged BRICS members to tackle their trade imbalances with the country. At a virtual summit on Monday, India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said the country's "biggest trade deficits are with BRICS partners." The bloc's key members are Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.

Air India said it is strengthening its emphasis on safety. CEO Campbell Wilson said Tuesday that Air India was "fully embracing a new normal of even extra focus on safety." The carrier experienced a tragic crash in June, in which all but one of the 242 people on board were killed.

AI systems may feel real, but they don't deserve rights, said Microsoft's AI CEO.

Mustafa Suleyman said in an interview with WIRED published Wednesday that the industry needs to be clear that AI is built to serve humans, not to develop independent will or desires.

"If AI has a sort of sense of itself, if it has its own motivations and its own desires and its own goals — that starts to seem like an independent being rather than something that is in service to humans," he said. "That's so dangerous and so misguided that we need to take a declarative position against it right now."

The former DeepMind and Inflection cofounder pushed back against the idea that AI's increasingly convincing responses amount to genuine consciousness. It's "mimicry," he said.

He also said that rights should be tied to the ability to suffer — something biological beings experience but AI does not.

"You could have a model which claims to be aware of its own existence and claims to have a subjective experience, but there is no evidence that it suffers," he said.

Humans don't owe them any moral protection or rights. "Turning them off makes no difference, because they don't actually suffer," he added.

Suleyman's comments come as some AI companies explore the opposite: whether AI deserves to be treated more like sentient beings.

Anthropic has gone further than most companies in treating AI systems as if their welfare matters. The company has hired a researcher, Kyle Fish, whose role is to consider whether advanced AI might one day be "worthy of moral consideration."

His job involves exploring what capabilities an AI system would need before earning such protection, and what practical steps companies could take to safeguard the "interests" of AI, Anthropic told Business Insider last year.

Anthropic has also recently experimented with how to end extreme conversations — including child exploitation requests — in ways that extend "welfare" considerations to the AI itself.

In April, a principal scientist at Google DeepMind said the industry might need to rethink the concept of AI consciousness altogether.

"Maybe we need to bend or break the vocabulary of consciousness to fit these new systems," Murray Shanahan said on a Deepmind podcast published in April. "You can't be in the world with them like you can with a dog or an octopus — but that doesn't mean there's nothing there."

Suleyman previously said that there is no evidence that AI is conscious.

In a personal essay published last month, he wrote that he was "growing more and more concerned" about so-called AI psychosis, a term increasingly being used to describe when people form delusional beliefs after interacting with chatbots.

Suleyman and Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Business Insider Edition 

Ghana has become the latest African nation to accept deportees under President Donald Trump's immigration policy, with 14 West African migrants arriving in Accra following their removal from the United States.


        Ghana has officially joined the list of African nations cooperating with the Trump administration's controversial deportation programme, opening its doors to migrants expelled from the United States.
    


        President John Dramani Mahama confirmed that a group of 14 deportees, among them Nigerians and one Gambian, had already arrived in Accra as per Reuters



        According to him, the Ghanaian government immediately facilitated their transfer back to their respective home countries, underscoring the nation's role as a temporary transit hub rather than a final destination.
    


        Mahama did not set any limits on how many deportees Ghana would accept, but defended the arrangement by pointing to the country's regional obligations.



“We were approached by the U.S. to accept third-party nationals who were being removed from the U.S., and we agreed with them that West African nationals were acceptable because all our fellow West Africans don't need a visa to come to our country,” he told reporters.
    


        His remarks highlighted the ease of movement within West Africa, while also signalling Accra's willingness to cooperate with Washington's push to expand deportation partnerships.
    


        The Trump administration has intensified its efforts to strike such deals with African governments, aiming to deter irregular migration through high-profile removals to so-called “third countries.”
    


        During a July 2025 meeting at the White House with the presidents of Mauritania, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau, and Liberia, U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of African nations hosting migrants, presenting it as part of broader discussions on trade, security, and development.
    


        While several nations, Rwanda, Uganda, South Sudan and Eswatini, have agreed to similar arrangements, others, such as Nigeria, have resisted, arguing that the deals would not be politically or legally feasible.
    


        The roll-out has nonetheless been swift: in July, five migrants were deported to Eswatini and eight to South Sudan, followed in August by seven arrivals in Rwanda after Kigali agreed to take in as many as 250 deportees over time.
    


        Yet, the policy has drawn criticism from migrant advocates and human rights groups who warn that many deportees face uncertain or even dangerous conditions in their host or transit countries.
    


        The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who fought deportation amid plans to send him either to Uganda or Eswatini, exemplifies the growing tensions.
    


        His lawyers argued that the U.S. government had attempted to pressure him into a plea deal by threatening to relocate him to countries where he feared persecution.
    


        Against this backdrop, Ghana's entry onto the list of Trump's “deportee host countries” underscores the deepening geopolitical implications of the programme.
    


        It also raises questions about how far African states are willing to cooperate with Washington's immigration agenda and what safeguards, if any, will be in place for the deportees themselves.

Business Insider Edition 

South Africa recently condemned the actions of Russia against Ukraine via a statement from the country's Department of International Relations and Cooperation.


        South Africa, which currently has a budding relationship with Russia, spoke against Russia's decision to attack Ukrainian pensioners.
    


        DON'T MISS THIS: Ramaphosa engages Putin on Russia-South Africa bilateral agenda, Ukraine peace process



        Reports indicate that on Tuesday, a Ukrainian village was attacked by a Russian airstrike, which killed 24 elderly people collecting pensions.
    


        The attack seemed to have struck a chord with fellow BRICS member, South Africa, which noted that it was ‘deeply concerned' about the scale of violence being perpetrated, as seen on Bloomberg.
    


        “Deliberate targeting of non-combatants is a blatant violation of international humanitarian law,” the Department of International Relations and Cooperation said in a statement on Wednesday.
    


        “South Africa is deeply concerned about the indiscriminate attacks on civilians emanating from a Russian attack, which killed pensioners.”
    


        This is hardly the first time Pretoria has spoken against Russian actions, as South Africa, in August, decided to look into reports of Russian companies targeting young women for overseas work that may be supporting Moscow's war in Ukraine through drone factories.
    


        Concerning the war in Eastern Europe, South Africa has decided to remain on the fence, taking a non-aligned stance, as it continues its balancing act with the West and long-time ally, Russia.
    


        Its sentiments towards the conflict have always bordered on the idea of a cease-fire, thus allowing the country to entertain bilateral ties with both sides.
    


        This was evident when South African President Cyril Ramaphosa welcomed his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, to his first-ever visit to Africa.
    


        South Africa has also, in recent weeks, offered to play the role of mediator between the two warring states.
    


        “South Africa not only calls for a de-escalation and ceasefire, but also implores all parties to the conflict to abide by international law,” the statement said. “These breaches of international law escalate current global tensions.”
    


        Early in August, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke directly to both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in quick succession.
    


        Within 48 hours, each leader had updated Ramaphosa about the ongoing conflict.
    


The back-to-back conversations highlighted the country's delicate diplomatic balancing act while also reaffirming Ramaphosa's commitment to portraying South Africa as a competent mediator in one of the most intractable issues of the modern age.
    


        On August 7, President Ramaphosa spoke with Putin in response to the Russian leader's offer to brief him on the Ukrainian peace process and explore areas of mutual interest.
    


        The Kremlin leader expressed admiration and gratitude for South Africa's involvement in advancing peace talks, a notable concession from a regime that has repeatedly dismissed outside mediation as futile or biased.
    


        The next day, the South African president shifted his focus to Kyiv. Ramaphosa was briefed on Ukraine's position on the peace process during his phone conversation with Zelenskyy, according to a statement from the South African presidency.
    


        The Ukrainian leader praised South Africa for its ongoing aid in pursuing a peaceful resolution and emphasized Kyiv's commitment to creating long-term peace.

Oracle posted blockbuster gains on Wednesday, and the rally may not be over, according to equity analysts at Jefferies.

The surge in Oracle's stock price came after the software giant shocked Wall Street with a record $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, or RPO — a measure of contracted future revenue — in its fiscal first quarter.

That figure was up 359% year over year, surpassing cloud rivals Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, according to Jefferies' analysis.

Following the earnings release, Oracle's New York-listed stock closed 36% higher at $328.33 on Wednesday — its best one-day performance since 1992.

The phenomenal gains also briefly propelled CEO Larry Ellison to the position of the world's richest person, surpassing Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

Those eye-popping gains could be a sign of more to come for the $922 billion company.

"We see room for the stock to grind even higher as optimism builds around the outlook," wrote Jefferies' analysts in a Wednesday note.

They lifted Oracle's price target from $270 to $360 — implying 10% further upside from Wednesday's close.

Jefferies projects Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to expand 77% year-over-year to $18 billion in fiscal 2026 before scaling to $144 billion by 2030. This would represent a compound annual growth rate of nearly 70% from 2025 and outpace consensus forecasts by more than $50 billion.

Meanwhile, Oracle's multicloud database revenue surged more than 1,500% year over year, which Jefferies said underscores the robust adoption of its multicloud strategy.

That growth looks poised to continue: Oracle plans to add 37 data centers over the next several years.

Still, not everything met consensus in Oracle's first quarter.

Revenue rose 12% year-over-year, shy of Wall Street's 13% forecast.

Software and infrastructure as a service growth also came in under consensus. Oracle raised its capital expenditure forecast to $35 billion for fiscal 2026 — a 65% jump that mirrored an acceleration in infrastructure investment.

"The increase illustrates persistent supply constraints amid surging demand, particularly from AI workloads," wrote the analysts at Jefferies.

They warned that the ongoing AI infrastructure build-out is likely to compress margins going forward.

Even so, Jefferies said those near-term pressures are outweighed by the company's huge backlog and accelerating demand for AI workloads.

Oracle shares are extending gains to trade 1.4% higher in after-hours trade on Thursday. The stock is up 97% year-to-date.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Yangyang Guo, 34, a Chinese American now living in China. Her words have been edited for length and clarity.

I was born in Beijing and moved to Rhode Island at 8. My twin sister and I didn't speak English and were two of only three Asian kids at school. Even before I understood the words, I could tell people were making fun of me.

At first, our parents didn't let us speak Chinese at home so that we'd learn English faster. A year later, when I could barely write my own name, they panicked and had us relearn it.

When I started at Duke University, I was shocked by how many Asian students there were. I was used to being the only one in the room.

I majored in economics but discovered theater along the way, and chose to make it my minor. That's how I realized how much I loved being onstage, telling stories, and connecting with an audience.

The summer after freshman year, I returned to China to study ancient Chinese and was amazed at how much had changed since I had left the country in 1999.

After graduation, I applied for jobs in New York and got hired as an investment banking analyst.

When I asked my boss if I could take one acting class a week, she told me I wasn't committed enough.

Another time, as Hurricane Sandy approached and courier services were suspended, she insisted I hand-deliver a contract across the city. The group head ultimately suggested we fax it instead, sparing me the trip through the storm.

I could handle the long hours, but not the disrespect. After just over a year, I quit, joined an acting program in the city, and started going to auditions.

Opportunities for non-white actors were limited at the time. At one audition, for a play about an Italian-American wedding, the only Asian role was to enter, speak Mandarin, and serve as the butt of the joke.

One of my Duke professors, a close mentor, told me about a master's program at the Shanghai Theatre Academy.

My mom had always dreamed of retiring in China, but had recently died. The program felt like a way to reconnect with her homeland — and my own. In August 2016, I packed my bags and set off for Shanghai.

Shanghai felt modern and convenient, but adjusting wasn't easy. At first, people assumed I was local and got frustrated when I spoke broken Chinese; when I switched to English, they became polite after realizing I was a foreigner.

Nine years later, that dynamic has shifted. With rising cultural pride, people now ask, "Why don't you speak Chinese?"

My theater program was taught in English, and the faculty were supportive. In my first year, I landed roles I never could have had in the US, including the off-Broadway transfer of "Collective Rage: A Play in Five Betties" and Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" at the National Center for the Performing Arts in Beijing.

Back then, foreign actors had easier opportunities; post-COVID, the process is far more bureaucratic.

Moving to China was the right choice. Here, I've come up with a way to maintain financial stability while pursuing my passion.

I help about a dozen students a year apply to US colleges, guiding them on schools, majors, extracurriculars, internships, interviews, and the SATs.

We meet up every other week during their freshman and sophomore years and increase to weekly meetings starting in the second half of junior year. More than an application coach, I see myself as a mentor, hoping the lessons carry into other parts of their lives.

These days, most of my income comes from college counseling, though I still take on the occasional commercial or voice-acting gig.

That stability has given me the freedom to be creative without worrying about making ends meet. In the US, I'd probably be a starving artist waiting tables, but here I earn enough to focus on my passion, which has now expanded to include scriptwriting.

I'm currently writing a solo theater show about my mother. Like many Asian daughters, I've had a complicated relationship with her, but I feel I have the support system here to bring the show to life.

My dad supported my move initially, but he expected I'd come back after graduation. When I didn't, he told me he didn't understand my decision. After recent US political shifts, he stopped trying to convince me to return.

I still go back once a year. I feel American when I'm there. But the longer I stay in China, the more it feels like home.

Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea is doubling trading fees from 0.5% to 1% just weeks before the debut of its native SEA token. 

The increase, only briefly mentioned, came alongside other updates from OpenSea CMO Adam Hollander in a long X post on Monday, Sept. 8, including a new mobile app, a multimillion-dollar NFT collection, and the final rewards campaign.

According to Hollander, starting Sept. 15, half of all fees — now set at 1% for trading NFTs and 0.85% for token swaps — will be funneled into OpenSea's pre-token launch rewards pool, which already includes $1 million in Optimism's OP and Arbitrum's ARB tokens, with additional NFTs and tokens set to be distributed through a gamified system of “treasure chests.”

A spokesperson for OpenSea confirmed to The Defiant that OpenSea's fees “will be updated as part of powering the final pre-TGE rewards phase,” adding, however, that they “don't have information to share on whether the NFT fee will revert or be adjusted after the rewards program concludes.”

By raising fees, OpenSea may be shooting itself in the foot, especially with its key rival Blur charging no trading fees and competitors Magic Eden and LooksRare holding steady at 0.5%.

The fee change coincides with a broader product push. OpenSea unveiled a mobile app it calls “AI-native,” designed to unify portfolios across chains and offer real-time trading recommendations. The company also rolled out a Flagship Collection, committing over $1 million to acquire historic NFTs such as CryptoPunks.

An update on the long-awaited SEA token is expected in early October, with the foundation behind the project promising “thoughtful mechanics, clear reasons to hold, and long-term sustainability baked in from the start.”

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum is entering one of its most powerful phases yet, combining deep institutional interest with unprecedented levels of on-chain activity, according to the latest data from CryptoQuant.

Data points across spot ETFs, whale accumulation, staking, and smart contract usage indicate ETH's growing role as both a financial asset and the dominant programmable settlement layer. While fundamentals remain strong, market dynamics suggest that resistance levels could temper near-term gains.

Institutional participation in Ethereum has surged in recent months. Fund holdings have doubled since April 2025, now totaling 6.5 million ETH, while large whale wallets with balances between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH collectively hold more than 20 million ETH.

This shift demonstrates the deepening involvement of asset managers and sophisticated investors. However, the fact that so much “smart money” is already positioned could limit near-term upside unless fresh inflows sustain momentum.

The total amount of ETH staked has climbed to an all-time high of 36.15 million, a milestone that reflects long-term confidence in Ethereum's security and economic design.

Staking reduces circulating supply, creating natural bullish pressure as less ETH is available on the open market. At the same time, locking up this capital also means liquidity is constrained, which could slow the pace of new inflows if price momentum falters.

Overall, staking growth shows strong conviction among ETH holders but introduces a delicate balance between supply reduction and market flexibility.

Ethereum's utility as a programmable blockchain continues to expand. Both daily transactions and active addresses have hit record highs, showing its role in powering DeFi applications, stablecoin transfers, and tokenized assets, reports CryptoQuant.

Smart contract calls recently exceeded 12 million per day for the first time, reinforcing Ethereum's position as the settlement layer of choice for decentralized activity. This wave of network usage provides fundamental support to ETH's valuation and strengthens the case for long-term adoption.

Despite these bullish fundamentals, market dynamics show signs of consolidation. Exchange inflows have slowed sharply since Ethereum peaked near $5,000, reducing selling pressure and supporting stability.

However, ETH's rally stalled near the $5,200 realized price upper band, a historically strong resistance level. With ETH currently trading around $4,400, the market may be primed for sideways action or a modest correction unless it can decisively break through this resistance.

Analysts at Derive, a crypto options exchange, anticipate that Ethereum could climb to $6,000, driven by three major bullish factors, creating what could be the strongest crypto bull run in recent years.

Ethereum's dual momentum—institutional adoption on one side, record on-chain activity on the other—shows its unique role in the evolving digital asset environment. Whether this cycle delivers further price discovery depends on its ability to convert strong fundamentals into a sustained push beyond key resistance levels.

Markets are ignoring a hotter-than-expected inflation report and instead turning their attention to the latest signs that the U.S. labor market is faltering — a shift in focus that points to growing concern about a deeper economic slowdown.

Consumer prices rose a bit more than expected August, according to CPI data released Thursday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Both the headline rate of 2.9% and the core rate of 3.1% remain solidly higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Normally, that would suggest the U.S. central bank should hold off on interest rate cuts.

But investors barely flinched at the data and instead focused what typically is the lesser-followed weekly initial jobless claims from the Department of Labor. That data showed claims soaring to 263,000 last week — the highest in nearly four years and up from 236,000 the previous week and 235,000 forecast. That focus was reflected in bond yields, with the 10-year Treasury yield sliding five basis points to below 4% for the first time since the April tariff panic tanked global equity markets.

Crypto markets initially dipped on the faster than expected inflation data, but quickly rebounded as the employment data took center stage. Bitcoin BTC$114,431.30 and ether (ETH) are only modestly higher, but the bigger action is in altcoins, suggesting the sort of animal spirits one might associated with monetary policy about to get a lot easier. Solana SOL$226.61 has risen 11% week-over-week to its highest level since January and dogecoin DOGE$0.2525 17% on a weekly basis. XRP XRP$3.0303 is ahead 6.6% over the last week and back above $3.

“Evidence of a slowdown in the U.S. is now appearing in the hard data; it's no longer just in the sentiment surveys,” said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch.

As for the real economy, today's numbers offer a troubling glimpse into something the U.S. central bank has been working hard to avoid: stagflation. This economic condition, defined by the simultaneous occurrence of high inflation and stagnant growth, is rare and difficult to fix. For policymakers, it's a catch-22.

Cutting interest rates to stimulate growth risks inflaming inflation. But failure to ease monetary policy while the employment situation deteriorates isn't a much better alternative.

For now, traders are betting that the Fed will lean toward protecting growth over stamping out inflation, with odds pointing to a rate cut next week as a near certainty. Today's data, however, suggests that the balance is becoming harder to manage and the path ahead may be more complicated than the market is pricing in.

“It's going to be a rough few months ahead as the tariffs impacts work their way through the economy," said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. "Americans will experience higher prices and (likely) more layoffs.”

 Hoarding is a vice—unless it involves cryptocurrency. Then, it's a hot business strategy.


 There's money to be made buying up all kind of crypto these days. Eightco Holding (ORBS), Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), and Sharplink Gaming (SBET) have all announced plans to become crypto treasuries—companies that buy up coins for their balance sheets—and seen their stocks surge in response.


 Their shares have outpaced bitcoin and stocks linked to it, in some cases climbing 500% or more year-to-date. A revival in bitcoin alternatives, or altcoins, which fall in and out of favor over crypto cycles, could make these companies not just trendy climbers but also stock proxies for the assets they hold, further legitimizing those coins.


 They are part of a new wave of crypto assets—from high-profile IPOs, ETFs holding memes like dogecoin, and freshly unlocked tokens— that are flying towards the markets and at times flying upward once they hit them.


 Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), which got the news last week that it wouldn't be included in the S&P 500 index, is the best-known example of a company turned crypto treasury. A handful of companies now want to do the same thing for assets ranging from number-two cryptocurrency ether (ETHUSD) to worldcoin (WLDUSD) and Trump family-linked coins like World Liberty Financial's token (WLFIUSD).


 Traders are 'buying these vehicles as plays on the price and attention momentum or a way to get exposure to crypto that doesn't have an ETF yet," Tom Bruni, head of markets and investor insights at StockTwits, told Investopedia recently.


 What's next for altcoin treasury stocks remains an open question, though at least one crypto market indicator has been flashing in favor of altcoins, which could help their stock treasuries.


 Bitcoin dominance, which measures bitcoin's market cap as a percentage of the entire crypto universe, has fallen from 65% in late June to around 56% recently, according to CoinGecko. Ether gained to around 13% from around 9% in that time, while other non-stablecoins have as a group climbed to 24% from 19%.


 Eightco stock recently got supercharged after the company said that it was raising funds to become a treasury for worldcoin, the token tied to the Sam Altman venture aimed at creating biometrics-based digital identities. It also said Wall Street tech analyst Dan Ives would be its new chairman.


 Bitcoin miner Bitmine and sports betting company SharpLink Gaming are lining up behind ether. The former, which tapped Fundstrat chief Tom Lee as chairman, aims to build a "tower of ether" and acquire 5% of the total supply. Though ether supply isn't fixed, it's at roughly 121 million recently, according to etherscan.


 A pending special purpose acquisition company deal with Dynamix could produce a company called The Ether Machine, another treasury company for ether. The July announced merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter, after which the company will list on the Nasdaq under the symbol "ETHM."


 There are about 70 ether treasury companies, according to the tracking site strategicethreserve.xyz, with Bitmine, SharpLink and the Ether Machine the largest; the list is dominated by crypto projects, rather than publicly traded companies.

 Bitcoin price action gets lively as US CPI data conforms to expectations, but traders are anything but unified on short-term price targets. 

Key points:

Bitcoin nears three-week highs as US CPI data matches expectations.

Plenty of market participants see Bitcoin heading higher as aresult, perhaps after a dip to trap late longs.

CPI has seen BTC price fakeouts in recent months.

Bitcoin (BTC) saw telltale volatility at Thursday's Wall Street open as US macro data furthered interest-rate cut odds.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD spiking to $114,731.

The August print of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in as expected, complementing a marked cooling of the Producer Price Index (PPI) the day prior.

While CPI was at its highest since January, the headline figure was instead initial jobless claims, which saw their largest numbers since October 2021 at 263,000 versus 235,000 expected.

Amid ongoing concerns about labor market weakness, bets of the Fed cutting rates at its Sept. 17 meeting only strengthened after the CPI release, with markets even seeing an 11% chance of the cut being more than the minimum 0.25%.

“Markets are now pricing-in 75 basis points of rate cuts by year-end,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter noted in a follow-up thread on X. 

Crypto commentators saw the case for higher prices next as Bitcoin passed $114,500 for the first time since Aug. 24.

“PPI much lower than expected, CPI as expected,” popular trader Jelle responded in an X post. 

BTC price forecasts also stressed the importance of recent support reclaims.

For fellow trader BitBull, flipping $113,500 from resistance to support was the key low-time frame event, which opened the door to a rematch with all-time highs.

Some perspectives nonetheless saw a fresh support retest coming before a return to price discovery.

Trader Skew argued that the market would attempt to trap and liquidate longs that entered on the CPI release.

“One more liquidation before higher,” part of an X post suggested, noting 2,000 BTC of liquidity appearing on exchange order books.

Crypto investor and entrepreneur Ted Pillows went further, suggesting that BTC/USD would copy previous CPI behavior to first rise then plumb fresh lows.

“In the last 3 CPI data releases, Bitcoin rallied before CPI data and dumped right after the data release,” he observed alongside an explanatory chart.

Oops, something went wrong

Stablecoin lender Figure Technology Solutions (FIGR) will make its public debut on the Nasdaq via an IPO on Thursday, raising $787.5 million from its IPO price of $25 per share.

Figure co-founder and executive chairman Mike Cagney sits down with Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi to discuss the company's blockchain model for crypto transactions, the regulatory environment for stablecoins, and the executive's own background in personal finance technology.

Cagney is also the co-founder and former CEO of fintech company SoFi Technologies (SOFI).

Well, stablecoin issuer Figure Technologies is going public on the Nasdaq today, set to trade under the ticker FIGR after raising more than $780 million. Want to toss it over to Yahoo Finance Executive editor Brian Sozi, who's with the Figure Technologies co-founder and executive chairman, Mike Cagney. 

All right, thanks so much Julie. Mike, uh good to see you. Congrats on this debut. Um, look, uh I think investors are very intrigued by your story. When you in the lead up to this debut, Mike, what did you hear from investors because I'm getting indications that this might open around $34. It priced above the range. Clearly where investors were excited about something in your business model or many things. 

Yeah, I think Figure is using blockchain technology to transform capital markets and we've proven to be very effective at doing that in the credit domain. Over $17 billion dollars of originations on public blockchain, over $55 billion dollars of transactions. And I think the market resonated to the product market fit with blockchain, but also the financials. obviously doing 340 million of revenue and over 100 million in E last year, being gap profitable and growing at the pace at which we're growing. There was a lot of enthusiasm there. So we were excited about the market reaction and excited to get this IPO done. 

In its simplest form, uh uh Mike, you know, I think a lot of the average investors that are on Yahoo Finance, they will read the prospectus, uh they will slightly understand what you do and how you do it. but for those that don't get it, uh because it is a little bit of a complicated business. How should they think about the figure model? What what do you do? 

Sure. The the beauty of blockchain is it allows you to displace trust with truth. And and that allows you to change how markets trade, how they're financed. So, you know, if you think of of something like the stock market as an easy example, seven parties sit in between buyers and sellers of every transaction. blockchain has the ability to distill that down just to two. Um every time we swipe a debit card, five parties sit in between that the buyer and seller, blockchain can distill that down to two. So when you disintermediate those actors, you're you're freeing up trillions of dollars of market capitalization. And I think that's why the market's excited. but it's not just the the disruption of the existing businesses, it's the green field opportunity as well. Blockchain allows you to create new markets that didn't exist very much like what we've done in private credit where we created a liquid private credit marketplace for both the trading and financing of assets in a market that didn't exist before and and really could only be done with blockchain. 

That is a large uh slug of money that you raised Mike, almost $800 million. Where will some of that go? what technology are you going to put that uh that money towards? 

Sure. and and look, I mean in in our last company we did a billion dollar raise from Softbank, which was the largest private company raise ever done and and, you know, we used that balance sheet as a weapon, um to be able to take risks that our competitors couldn't. I think that's perfectly analogous here. I think having that balance sheet's going to allow us to lean in and really push disruptive blockchain use cases in a way that not having that capital would would be difficult. 

Is this the perfect environment for stable coins? Curious your take on uh how the regulatory environment has changed this year even compared to when we talked a couple months ago. 

Yeah, I think I think on a first order basis, obviously the genius act is hugely beneficial for the stablecoin industry. The the second order effect of of the stablecoin aspect, especially as money flows into Treasuries, out of bank deposits introduces a tremendous opportunity for decentralized finance, which is really at its core what blockchain's for. And so, you know, we're excited to be a leader in in the Dfi side and and really, you know, leaning in and looking forward to how that market evolves over the next year. 

I hope I got this right. Are you using Open AI to approve mortgage loans? How how does that work? 

No, we we we use a lot of AI through our process. Um but but we tend to underwrite in a very boring way. Um what we do is we don't use humans. And so by taking people out of the process, we have over 170 third parties that use our technology to originate assets on chain and they all do it the exact same way. That homogeneity of those assets coupled with the certainty of blockchains allowed us to bring liquidity into that market where again it never existed. 

What are you seeing in the in the housing market? 

Uh look, I I think obviously rates are beginning to come down. uh that's beneficial. That's that's great for all lenders including ourselves. Um reduces debt burden, reduces DTI considerations. Uh but you know, how far it goes, I'm not sure we're going to retest those lows of COVID. Um and so I think, you know, the folks that are in 2% mortgages are still going to hold on to those mortgages and that's great for for home equity line of credit and second lean. But over 20% of our volume now is first lean mortgage and and we expect that to continue to expand especially as rates fall. 

Is it right to think you could be sitting on a very profitable year next year once rate cuts uh do start to flow in and the housing market hits some new gear that it hasn't been in for a couple years. 

Yeah, look, I I think there's certainly some macro catalysts out there, some tailwinds around uh the market, the interest rate environment. I also think, you know, what you'll see from us over the coming years is is coming next 12 months is expanding the blockchain application into other asset classes. So just as we've been able to use it for private credit, we think it's equally applicable in equities and commodities and currencies and and so, you know, we look forward to leaning into those asset classes and driving new innovative use cases. 

Is the stock market just outdated, Mike, I see what you're doing. I it's fascinating technology but you know, I I look at the New York Stock Exchange even the Nasdaq, I mean they're phenomenal companies, entities, but I see what you're doing and I just think the whole game is about to change in a big way. 

I think we're right on the cusp. I I think if you looked at how much we accomplished over the last four years in a very, very difficult regulatory environment and the environment that we now have with a different SEC and with with an administration that's supportive of the technology, I think an enormous number of things are going to happen. It it's sort of the proverbial slow and then all at once. and I think we're really at a tipping point. I think blockchain is going to be uh responsible for moving more public market cap than ever any technology has ever done before and probably ever ever will after. 

I think about the the business you created over at Sofi Mike. Now you're out here uh with Figure. Clearly you have a passion for, I wouldn't say personal finance, maybe I I should. what what has driven you to to spend so much of your career and so much of your time in this industry? 

Yeah, so I I I'm very passionate around connecting sources and uses of capital. If you go back to when we started Sofi, that was the thesis behind it. We take alumni to invest in loans from students from their schools and have an affinity bond and and where both parties could improve versus the bank as a capital allocator. And you know, with Sofi we were a victim of our own success. The loans became so popular, we just relied on the wholesale capital markets to finance them. Figure gave me a second shot at this with blockchain and with Dfy. And so we're very excited about standing up a platform we have called democratized Prime where we connect sources and uses of capital and really disintermediating traditional capital allocators and letting individuals make their own lending decisions. And I think that ultimately is where the world's going to go to. I think with the stable coin bill, the genius act, the second order consideration, again is with all that money flowing into treasuries, it's coming at the expense of bank liabilities. That's going to force some kind of alternative way to look at credit. and I think decentralized finance is that way. 

Well, congrats on your big day. Thanks for always making time for me uh and the Ya Finance team. uh good luck for the rest of the day. I'm sure it's going to be very busy. uh figure uh executive chair, uh Mike Cagney, appreciate it. 

Thank you.

 The U.K.'s Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) warned on Thursday that student hackers motivated by dares are driving an increasing number of cyberattacks and data breaches affecting schools. 

 It advised parents to “to have regular conversations with their children about what they get up to online” and warned that children hacking into their school's computer systems may be setting themselves up for lives of cybercrime. 

 The privacy regulator said it identified “a worrying pattern” in the 215 insider threat breach reports from the education sector between January 2022 and August 2024, with 57% of incidents caused by students who were likely motivated by “dares, notoriety, financial gain, revenge and rivalries.” 

 The advisory comes as young, English-speaking cybercriminals have made headlines with their reported involvement in cyberattacks in recent years. In July, the National Crime Agency (NCA) arrested four individuals — three of them teenagers — on suspicion of involvement in a range of ransomware attacks targeting British retailers. 

 “Teen hackers are commonly English speaking males and around 5% of 14-year-old boys and girls admit to hacking,” the privacy watchdog stated. 

 Diverting children with an interest in technology away from criminality and into legal programs is a key aim of the NCA, which believes that one-in-five children in Britain aged 10 to 16 has engaged in illegal activity online. The NCA said the youngest referral it had made to its Cyber Choices program was just seven years old. 

 Some of the 215 breaches in the education sector were caused by what the ICO described as poor data protection practices, including staff accessing data without a legitimate need, by devices being left unattended or by students being allowed to use staff devices. 

 Just 5% of incidents involved insiders “using sophisticated techniques to bypass security and network controls” stated the regulator. 

 Cases shared by the ICO included three Year 11 students — roughly equivalent to the 10th grade — hacking their school's information management system using tools they'd downloaded from the internet. 

 “When questioned, the students admitted being interested in IT and cyber security, and that they wanted to test their skills and knowledge,” the regulator added, noting that two admitted they “belong to an online hackers forum.” 

 In another case that was reported to the police, a student “viewed, amended or deleted personal information belonging to more than 9,000 staff, students and applicants” to their college after using a staff login to access its systems, said the ICO. 

 “What starts out as a dare, a challenge, a bit of fun in a school setting can ultimately lead to children taking part in damaging attacks on organisations or critical infrastructure,” warned Heather Toomey, the ICO's principal cyber specialist. 

 “It's important that we understand the next generation's interests and motivations in the online world to ensure children remain on the right side of the law and progress into rewarding careers in a sector in constant need of specialists,” she added.

It's hard to ignore the impact Gary Vaynerchuk (aka Gary Vee) had on the NFT space in 2021-22. The founder and CEO of VaynerMedia and prolific content creator onboarded thousands of new people onchain with the launch of his project, VeeFriends. 

For those outside of the Vaynerchuk ecosystem, VeeFriends was misunderstood when it launched and for many, still remains so today. It often sits outside the regular discourse on NFT Twitter and its extensive character base can make it seem complex to the causal NFT degen. 

But despite this, four-plus years on, VeeFriends continues to expand its universe. While the brand and IP was born out of the blockchain, VeeFriends has crossed over into different worlds and niches most NFT collectors would not even be aware of.

We sat down with VeeFriends president Andy Krainak to discuss what's been cooking at VeeFriends and what it's like to work with Vaynerchuk on a project whose mission statement he describes as: “Brick by brick, we build”.

Vaynerchuk has described VeeFriends as his “Pokemon, Disney, Sesame Street or Marvel,” an IP ecosystem of characters based on traits he believes in and wants to spread positivity through. 

The original genesis of VeeFriends is the Series 1 NFT Collection that minted around the same time as Bored Ape Yacht Club and Meebits, and just two months after Beeple's iconic $69 million sale of “Everydays: The First 5000 Days,” which set rocket fuel under the emerging category of crypto.

All of the Series 1 VeeFriends were hand-drawn by Vaynerchuk himself and are described as the grail collectible in the VeeFriends universe. The collection features 10,255 NFTs, representing 268 unique characters. Of these, 236 characters are IP characters that grant admission to VeeCon, such as Gift Goat NFTs and “access tokens” such as Basketball Butterfly and Facetime Five.

NFTs with “utility” weren't yet cliche during the lead up to the VeeFriends mint, and Vaynerchuk was ahead of the curve attaching a three-year ticket to VeeCon for 2022, 2023 and 2024 for each Series 1 VeeFriend. VeeCon is Vaynerchuk's version of an SXSW-style conference.

Krainak describes the IP play as constantly evolving and that it's not just a traditional NFT project that often revolves around a single character. 

“It's a universe of over 250 characters that are coming to life through comics and collectibles. Every character will have a different origin and meaning, but it's grounded in our ultimate collectible, which is a Series 1 VeeFriend NFT, which unlocks different opportunities and advantages either in our collectible ecosystem or with other perks and special events with the VeeFriends community,” Krainak says.

For Series 1, the floor price currently sits at 1.05 ETH ($4,545), but as Krainak points out, it's a collection that traditional floor price isn't the easiest to translate due to the extensive character library.

“The interesting thing about VeeFriends is it does have a floor price but I actually think VeeFriends has 250 different floor prices, based on the character. Some characters are way more popular than others and the prices reflect that.”

With Vaynerchuk's favorite number being five, the mint had originally been earmarked for 5/5/21, but a few delays set it back. Krainak recalls how intense that period was, living at Vaynerchuk's apartment in the lead-up and ultimately seeing his boss the most emotional he'd ever seen him once the mint went live.

“That launch changed my relationship with Gary. I was basically living at his apartment for a week. We just weren't sleeping. We were trying to get it done. I really learned the aptitude he had to do what he did throughout that time. I saw how fearless he was.” 

“He's a very successful individual and businessman. He did not need to launch VeeFriends. Was there capital to gain? Yes, but there's also so much downside. He put his reputation and legacy on the line because he wanted to build this IP, and he thought putting collectibles and his IP first on the blockchain was not only going to be an unprecedented opportunity to build IP, but to be a blueprint for how others could do it.”

“That's the most emotional I've ever seen him. I think it was a culmination of everything. All the hard work that we did to get to that launch and just cementing what was going to become like his life's legacy as creating an IP.”

Since the original launch in May 2021, VeeFriends has gone on to launch two NFT additional collections — Book Games in August 2021, and Series 2 of VeeFriends in April 2022, while VeeFriends “Iconics” also carved out a slice of the NFT pie in the ecosystem.

Book Games tokens were available to anyone who purchased 12 or more copies of Gary's Twelve and a Half book, his sixth at the time, in August 2021. The book shot up the New York Times Bestsellers list, and eligible purchasers of the book received their Book Games NFTs in early January 2022. The collection spanned 125,000 NFTs, but the total quantity is now down to 98,800 NFTs as these tokens are burnable for certain benefits. The floor price for Book Games sits at 0.18 ETH ($80).

In April 2022, Series 2 of VeeFriends was introduced with a mint of 55,555 NFTs that introduced 15 new characters to VeeFriends, including Resilient Red Devil, Gritty Ghost and Competitive Clown. This series also saw the return of 236 characters from Series 1, with the original drawings being brought to life through animations — a completely different look and feel suitable for cartoons and future IP development. Floor price for Series 2 VeeFriends currently sits at 0.052 ETH ($226).

Each Series 2 NFT also received a physical counterpart in a box of the VeeFriends Trading Card Game.

“Something that I think has always been important to Gary and VeeFriends is, aside from the collectibility of the characters and creating connection with the characters, is driving digital ownership. And with that, Gary's always been bullish on creating instant value with the purchase of the NFT,” says Krainak.

“For Series 1, that was access to VeeCon for three years. In Series 2, it was if you minted, you got a box of trading cards. That box of trading cards right now is around $400. It's almost about to be the mint price of the NFT itself.”

The VeeFriends universe has expanded from NFTs into physical collectibles, comics, content, apparel and pop culture. 

Earlier this year, VeeFriends partnered with Topps, with the physicalTopps VeeFriends Chrome cards released in a limited edition featuring 100 of the 250+ characters. The YouTube Kids cartoons for VeeFriends have their owndedicated channeland align with Vaynerchuk's vision of building out a brand that is “for people that are for 3-year-olds all the way to 93. VeeFriends is for every age and every person.”

To date, some of the VeeFriends partnerships and collaborations include: UNO, Macy's, Starter, Chuck E Cheese, Reebok, Toys R Us, Mattel and Nick Kyrgios.

Krainak began working for Vaynerchuk back in 2013 after stumbling upon Wine Library TV while taking a wine course. He was immediately captured by the content Vaynerchuk was delivering and by the New Yorker's unique communication style.

One tweet and one email later, Krainak joined Vayner Media as an intern and spent the next nine years leading “Team Gary.” Timing was everything with his transition to VeeFriends President in 2021.

“Right around the beginning of 2021, I had just bought my first CryptoPunk, and Gary decided he was going to launch his own IP, first as NFTs, and he wanted me to be the president,” Krainak says.

Krainak says working for Vaynerhuck is “exactly what you would think and expect it to be like working for him. I think people would be shocked at how involved he is. It could be something as random as a DM our social account gets that he wants to know the messaging on how we're responding back.”

“He's heavily involved in everything, but VeeFriends is probably the most involved in all of his businesses. These are his characters. He drew them. He has a specific vision for how he wants them to look on a trading card, yet alone how he wants his conference VeeCon to be thrown.”

Known for his nonstop high energy and in-your-face style of communication, Krainak highlights Vaynerchuk's upbringing in Soviet Russia as a driver for his work ethic.

“He just loves it and it's 24/7, non-stop. He says that it comes from gratitude and I believe that when his family was traded for wheat to be able to escape Soviet Russia. It really was humble beginnings.”

“He grew up with 13 people in a small apartment in New York City, and I think those upbringings are why he's grinding from 6:00 am to 11:00 pm, ready to talk business.”

What's your favorite crypto?

I bought ETH around 2019. I've always loved ETH. Bitcoin versus ETH, I think both are winners. I think the future of both those cryptos is very, very bright.

Your personal favorite VeeFriends characters if you had to name 3-5. 

It really ebbs and flows, but I'll give you a few.

1. Very, Very, Very, Very, Lucky Black Cat: The logo character. I was there when Gary chose it. It wasn't always the logo. It was a couple days before we launched where Gary decided that he wanted it to be the black cat, and I thought that was a really special moment. I think it's representative of what VeeFriends is, which is it's up to you to define what success is and what you want your life to be. People say black cats are unlucky, but who's to say that?

2. Forever Phoenix: A lot of the VeeFriends community knows this is one of my favorite characters. Gary gifted me the Phoenix holo right after the launch as the first NFT to ever leave his collection, so that sort of just means a lot to me sentimentally.

3. Rare Robot: It was always a cool character. It was nowhere near where it is now. Creating the Rare Robot song did a lot for it.

4. Jolly Jack-O: Having the Funko Pop did a lot for it.

5. Chill Chinchilla: We have a huge jumbo plushy that is on our livestreams a lot on whatnot. And because of that jumbo plushy just sitting in the background, it started to gain more momentum.

Will we ever see another VeeCon? 

Yes, 100%. At VeeCon 3, we announced that we will be doing VeeCon again. We didn't give any further details, but basically said this isn't the last VeeCon.

What are people missing with VeeFriends in your opinion? 

That we are a real company. We're a transmedia company. We are storytelling in comics, in YouTube kids cartoons, in trading cards with the biggest most recognizable trading card brand in the world, Topps. We're on TikTok live and whatnot live 60 hours a week, and that we are not going anywhere.

What's a sleeper VeeFriends character?A funny one that I'll give love to is Patient Panda. Patient Panda is a top-five character in VeeFriends. But it's actually a sleeper character because we've given it no shine, and there's something to that. It's being patient.

What other NFTs outside of your VeeFriends do you own that you really like? 

I actually personally like v1 Punks. I like the thesis. I think they're hitting an evolution where it's no longer us versus them with v2 Punks. I'm in love with the idea of having a pair of my v2 and v1 Punk.

I would also say Moonbirds. I really like Spencer. I met him prior to him taking over the project, and I was talking to him about TCG (Trading Card Game). He's just smart and a good dude, and I was pumped when I heard he bought Moonbirds, and I support him. I think they're going to do well.

Even though I'm currently down bad on it, I have a Damien Hirst “The Currency.” I just believe in the operator and the creator. I'm also big into physical trading cards too. I have a pretty serious LeBron James collection, and Mbappe I think is underrated.

Who are your favorite follows on X (Twitter)? 

Most of my stuff is all the ETH Maxis, DC Investor, etc. I really like Tom Lee and his thesis with BitMine and Granny Shots.

I think OpenSea is doing a good job trying to do more editorial content and building the culture a little bit. 

Thread Guy is a friend. I like him. I think he's been in hot and tricky waters, but I think he's doing his best to navigate it. 

Ansem is funny. Crypto Twitter is funny. They all want the same thing. 

What's your advice to someone trying to get started in the VeeFriends universe? 

There's a blog that we have that basically gives a great overview of what VeeFriends is. Outside of that, my real answer would be to come and join one of our live shows with Gary. Through that, you will learn the characters, you will see the community,and  you will see the passion and fandom we have around our characters.

Cointelegraph Magazine is a new publication that goes beyond the daily news and delves much more deeply into the stories, trends, and personalities that inspire cryptocurrency and blockchain conversations around the world.

We are people-centric, delving into *why* the true believers of blockchain feel they can change the world (and why they think it needs to be changed).

Through long-form features, thoughtful analysis, and a little humor and satire, we illustrate how the implementation of this technology is affecting the lives of countless people — today, right now, not at some distant point in the future.

 The petition, made in July, reached more than half of the required signatures for a government response after Coinbase sent out a push notification to its users. 

A public petition calling on the United Kingdom to develop a pro-innovation strategy for blockchain and stablecoins has gained momentum following a push from crypto exchange Coinbase.

The petition, hosted on the UK government's website, calls for a comprehensive framework that includes stablecoin regulation, blockchain adoption and the appointment of a blockchain “czar.”

Although launched in July, the initiative drew attention this week after Coinbase sent in-app messages encouraging users to sign. Screenshots shared by users on social media showed in-app messages from the exchange, rallying its users with phrases like “help UK lead stablecoin innovation now.”

At the time of writing, the petition had gathered over 5,000 signatures. When it reaches 10,000 signatures, the UK government must respond to the petition. At 100,000, the petition will be considered for parliamentary debate. The petition remains open for signatures until March 3, 2026. 

The proposal outlines three demands: creating a framework for stablecoins and tokenization, encouraging blockchain use within government, and appointing a leader dedicated to crypto policy.

The petition states that stablecoins are the basis of a tokenized economy, citing the United States' ruling out of a central bank digital currency, favoring stablecoins instead. Supporters of the petition said the UK will fall behind other jurisdictions without a strategy. 

“This is a question of national interest to preserve the competitiveness of the City and sterling's global standing,” they wrote.

Coinbase has previously campaigned for clearer digital asset rules in the UK.

On July 31, the exchange released a satirical video titled “Everything is Fine,” taking aim at Britain's financial system. The video used lyrics and music that brag about the country's strong finances while depicting scenes of inflation, poverty and financial struggles. 

On Aug. 5, former UK Chancellor and current Coinbase adviser George Osborne penned an op-ed for the Financial Times, highlighting that the country is falling behind in the digital asset market. He singled out stablecoins as an area where the country has allowed itself to lag.

Cointelegraph reached out to Coinbase for comment but did not receive a response before publication.

Nasdaq-listed Forward Industries (FORD) said Thursday it has closed the $1.65 billion private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal to build out corporate crypto treasury centered on Solana SOL$227.35.

The cash and stablecoin commitments, led by Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto and Multicoin Capital, will fund the company's plan to anchor its balance sheet in Solana's native token, SOL.

The three lead investors contributed more than $300 million, joined by firms including Bitwise Asset Management, Borderless Capital and SkyBridge Capital, as well as several crypto founders and angel investors. Multicoin co-founder Kyle Samani has been appointed chairman of the board, while Galaxy's Chris Ferraro and Jump Crypto's Saurabh Sharma will serve as observers.

The company's stock surged as much as 15% before paring some of the gains in pre-market trading.

The move comes as public companies explore digital asset treasuries, holding crypto directly on their balance sheets, seeking to mirror early adopters like Micheal Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), which has become the largest corporate owner of bitcoin BTC$114,563.65.

Solana-focused treasury firms including DeFi Development (DFDV), Upexi (UPXI) and Sol Strategies (STSS) collectively hold over $1.4 billion in SOL, Blockworks data shows.

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune.

If there's one constant in crypto, it's volatility. Since Bitcoin first emerged in 2009, there have been euphoric upswings and catastrophic declines. Crypto bubbles lead to crypto collapses.

Arjun Sethi, the co-CEO of Kraken, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges last reportedly valued at $15 billion, believes we're now in the midst of a bubble. When Fortune's Jeff John Roberts asked the crypto executive whether that was the case during a panel at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference in Park City, Utah, Sethi responded yes—with some nuance.





“Are we in a bubble or not? If I look at the overall slope over 15 years, I would say no,” said the Kraken executive. “If you look at it quarter by quarter, the answer is yes, we get into those bubbles all the time.”





That even a crypto CEO would say that his industry is headed for a potential crash speaks to the frothiness in the crypto markets over the past year. Since January, Bitcoin has repeatedly notched all-time highs and the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has crossed the $4 trillion for the first time. That's not to mention blockbuster IPOs from the stablecoin issuer Circle and the crypto exchange Bullish.





While some of that enthusiasm stems from Bitcoin's correlation with the stock market—the S&P 500 has also set new records since President Donald Trump's inauguration in January—pro-crypto regulatory changes in the U.S. are also a likely factor for crypto's recent surge.




But all bubbles eventually pop, and there are already signs of a potential burst, including declining enthusiasm in crypto's newest trend: digital asset treasuries, or public companies that amass crypto on their balance sheets to boost their share prices.





Proponents say these companies let investors gain exposure to cryptocurrencies not readily accessible within their brokerage accounts, but detractors say these firms are a quick cash grab and will eventually collapse. There may already be signs of that collapse. Last week, the average drop in stock price of 15 digital asset treasuries tracked by Architect Partners, a crypto M&A advisory and financing firm, was 15%.





Still, on the same panel with Kraken co-CEO Sethi, billionaire Barry Silbert, founder of the crypto company Digital Currency Group, was optimistic. “There's a whole lot of crap in crypto right now, which is overvalued. I think 99% of crypto is absolutely going to zero,” he said. “But that asset class, the crypto asset class, is absolutely not in a bubble right now.”





And if Bitcoin's history of big drops and even bigger rebounds is any indication, Silbert may be right.





Klarna… Yesterday, Klarna went public in a long-awaited IPO, where the stock popped as much as 25%. In the lead-up to listing day, Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski sat down with the Term Sheet Podcast to talk about preparing to go public, why he loves Walmart, and the future of financial services.

Altcoins drove the gains this week while Bitcoin steadied. Ethereum remains the standout as options data adds an institutional layer to the story.

Crypto markets finished the last 7 days on a strong note, with altcoins leading the charge. Dogecoin (+16%), Avalanche (+17%), NEAR (+12%), and Solana (+10%) all outperformed. The majors also gained: Bitcoin (+3.3%) and Ethereum (+3.1%).

In the past 24 hours, momentum cooled. Bitcoin slipped −0.1%, Ethereum added +0.6%, while Solana (−0.5%) and Dogecoin (−0.4%) paused after big weekly runs. Bitcoin Cash (+1.6%) and TRON (+0.6%) managed to hold firmer.

On the hourly view, buying interest returned: Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin, and LINK all ticked higher. That's a signal some traders are leaning back in after the 24-hour slowdown.

The Momentum Alignment Score tracks whether a coin is up or down across three timeframes — 7-day, 24-hour, and 1-hour. A higher score means consistency, a lower score shows fading strength.

Ethereum (MAS +3): Up across all timeframes, the cleanest leader among majors.

Bitcoin (MAS +1): Stronger weekly, flat short-term.

Solana & Dogecoin (MAS +1): Strong week, a pause in the last day, then fresh hourly gains.

XRP (MAS −1): Weekly up, but slipping short-term.

Ethereum stands out as the most balanced mover right now.

BTC proxy — MAXI ETF

Current price: $28.69 (+3.2% at last close).

Open interest for Sept 19 expiry: 55% puts vs 45% calls.

Key levels: Heavy put interest near $27; call interest near $34–35.

Takeaway: Institutions expect Bitcoin to stay range-bound between $27 and $35 into expiry, hedging downside risk while capping near-term upside.

ETH proxy — Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust

Current price: $40.71 (after hours $40.99).

Open interest: 55% calls vs 45% puts.

Key levels: Strong call positioning near $30, put protection around $42 and $50.

Takeaway: A slightly bullish setup, with traders building exposure but keeping protection in place. This matches Ethereum's clean MAS profile.

Altcoins dominated the weekly leaderboard, but today looked more like consolidation than reversal.

Ethereum remains the standout, supported by both momentum alignment and option positioning.

Bitcoin's cautious stance via MAXI options suggests a tighter trading band in the near term, while Ethereum's option flow points to gradual accumulation.

Today's pulse: crypto is catching its breath after a strong run, but with Ethereum leading and Solana/Dogecoin regaining hourly strength, the door stays open for further upside.

Can Ethereum extend its three-timeframe strength into the weekend?

Does Bitcoin respect the $27–35 MAXI range ahead of September expiry?

Do altcoins like Solana and Dogecoin keep their hourly momentum, or fade back into consolidation?

This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

Major cryptocurrencies are looking bullish, with market leader bitcoin BTC$114,563.65 exhibiting a classic inverse head-and-shoulders breakout that could propel it toward $120,000.

But there's a catch. The daily chart for the S&P 500 E-Mini futures is displaying a bearish pattern, indicating a potential sell-off that could weigh on the cryptocurrency market and trap bulls on the wrong side of the market. 

The E-mini futures have risen nearly 5% to a record high of $6,542 since Aug. 1. The slow ascent has taken the shape of a rising wedge pattern identified by converging trendlines connecting July 31 and Aug. 15 highs and lows reached on Aug. 1 and Aug. 22.

The converging trendlines indicate that bullish momentum is waning, increasing the likelihood of a sell-off.

When asked to identify and analyze the pattern on the S&P 500 futures, Google Gemini replied, "When a rising wedge, which is a bearish reversal pattern, appears after an extended rally to record highs, it significantly increases the probability of a sharp downside move. It suggests that buyers are exhausted and that the rally is running on fumes. The pattern indicates that the market is setting up for a major trend reversal rather than a simple pullback."

Cryptocurrencies are known to closely track Wall Street sentiment, which means that a potential decline in the S&P 500 could weigh on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The odds of a breakdown in the S&P 500 could rise sharply if Thursday's U.S. consumer price index (CPI) prints hotter than expected. Such a result, combined with the recent labor market weakness, may rekindle fears of stagflation—the worst-case scenario for risk assets—putting additional pressure on equities and cryptocurrencies alike.

The median forecast for the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) in August 2025 is a 2.9% year-over-year increase (not seasonally adjusted), according to FactSet. If this estimate holds true, it will be the highest annual rise since January 2025, when the CPI reached 3.0% and well above the Fed's 2% target. Additionally, this 2.9% figure would surpass the trailing twelve-month average inflation rate of 2.6%.

More importantly, the median estimate (year-over-year, not seasonally adjusted) for the core CPI, which excludes food and energy, is 3.1%.

The 25-delta risk reversals tied to Deribit-lited bitcoin and ether options were negative out to December expiry, according to data source Amberdata. In other words, short and near-dated BTC and ETH puts traded at a premium to calls, reflecting a bias for downside protection.

A put option protects the buyer from a decline in the value of the underlying asset. A call provides an asymmetric bullish exposure. The 25-delta risk reversal involves the simultaneous purchase of a put option and sale of a call, or vice versa.

According to Options Insights' Founder, Imran Lakha, the put bias in BTC is likely due to institutions placing long-term hedges. Flows have continued to trend lower on the over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm.

"Flows again featured the [ETH] 26 Sep 4k put, lifted up to 73v," Paradigm noted.

While BTC's inverse head-and-shoulders breakout suggests a strong bullish direction, XRP's price action appears indecisive.

The payments-focused cryptocurrency remains locked in a descending triangle and continues to trade within the Ichimoku cloud. Together, these indicators suggest a period of consolidation and uncertainty.

A breakout from the triangle might invite stronger buying pressure, potentially leading to a re-test of $3.38, the swing high from Aug. 8. That said, the descending triangle, by itself, is generally considered a bearish pattern. That's because the downward-sloping trendline connecting lower highs indicates that sellers are progressively getting stronger and could soon penetrate the horizontal support level.

Speaking of DOGE, it has retaken the bullish trendline from June lows, trapping sellers on the wrong side of the market. Additionally, prices have crossed into bullish territory above the Ichimoku cloud, which suggests scope for a test of the July high of 28.76 cents.

However, traders still need to watch out for a potential rising wedge breakdown in S&P 500 futures, as a reversal there could cap gains in DOGE and weigh on its price momentum.

Experts suggest growing anticipation ahead of key macroeconomic events this week has led to a stark divergence between futures traders betting on Ethereum and exchange-traded funds rotating their capital to Bitcoin.

Aggregate 24-hour futures volume for Ethereum reached $49.4 billion, surpassing Bitcoin's $42.9 billion, data from analytics firm Coinanalyze shows.

The surge in speculative interest for the second-largest crypto contrasts with capital flows in the ETF space.

U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have notched a net inflow of $1.39 billion over the past ten days, according to data from SoSoValue. 

Over the same period, spot Ethereum ETFs have seen outflows of $668 million, highlighting a rotational trade by institutional investors.

Stephen Gregory, founder of crypto trading platform Vtrader, told Decrypt that the divergence between the top two cryptocurrencies is typical, especially with the possibility of a half-point rate cut by the Fed, which is driving the shift in flows to Ethereum and altcoins.

“I think we'll close Q3 on an uptrend led by altcoins," he added.

Gregory's outlook is echoed by Coinanalyze data, which shows altcoins' share of total trading volume has jumped to 50% this week after consolidating around 40% for weeks. In comparison, Bitcoin's volume dominance fell to 21% from 31%.

Gregory attributed the strong Bitcoin ETF inflows to "FOMO trading from new wealth managers finally allowed to allocate capital."

As a result, the rotational trade has fueled a significant performance gap with Ethereum up 31% year-to-date, outpacing Bitcoin's 19% gain, CoinGecko data shows.

While the futures traders show a growing interest in Ethereum and altcoins, the options market data reveals a more tempered outlook. 

Implied volatility, which tracks the market's future expectations based on options data, continues to remain low, Adam Chu, Chief researcher at GreeksLive, an options trading platform, told Decypt. 

Despite the rate decision next week, he said, “the options market is pricing in relatively low future volatility, with a consensus that a 25-basis-point rate cut has already been factored in.”

“The overall market sentiment remains more favourable towards the fourth-quarter outlook,” Chu said.

COLLEGE STATION, Texas (KBTX) -With a city council vote approaching on Thursday, Priority Power CEO Brandon Schwertner is clearing the air about what he calls misconceptions about a proposed data facility that's being opposed by many residents in College Station.

He says the misconception originated from early documents that were drafted and eventually shared on social media that referenced Bitcoin mining, despite developers now stating that the project is focused on data and AI.

Schwertner plans to ask the city this week to remove the language in the land agreement with the city that references cryptocurrency.

“I think there was a general misconception, and rightfully so, that this was going to be a Bitcoin mining site,” Schwertner said. “We'll be asking the city council to strike that.”

Schwertner, a third-generation Aggie and former Texas A&M football player, said the data center, which is planned to be located near the Midtown area behind Costco, would focus on artificial intelligence and high-performance computing, and added that it could support the university, create jobs, and generate tax revenue.

“It's going to bring more business into the city,” he said. “You can't argue the taxation benefits that the city will get, the job creations.”

Concerns in College Station have been shaped in part by what's happening in other Texas communities. In Granbury, residents who live near a Bitcoin mine say constant sound has disrupted their daily lives.

“It's 10 o'clock at night, and I'm sitting next to my truck,” one resident said. “I'm actually touching my truck, and you're hearing all the Bitcoin noise. It's all you can hear.”

Another resident described the health effects of the noise.

“I'll be disoriented and like motion sickness during the day randomly,” the resident said. “We don't sleep at night. The sound here at night is so horrendous, it broadcasts through my walls, my windows.”

Schwertner said College Station residents would not face those conditions. “The technology is more sophisticated. Noise ordinances are known,” he said. “So that's all being worked on. So if this is going to be located in a city, there's not going to be noise issues — the city wouldn't allow for it.”

On infrastructure and utilities, Schwertner said the city previously allocated water for the site and that the proposal would stay within that limit. He said the project's power would be sourced to avoid impacts on residents' bills.

“The power is going to be externally sourced to that project. So if you think about the city and the residents in a silo, the high-performance computing center is not going to come in and take power out of the pool and then drive prices up as a result,” he said. 

“The cities would perform the service to keep the lights on at the facility just like they do at your house, and they charge, you know, a rate to do that. So it's not going to affect any of the residents in that area just because it's a large user of electricity.”

The College Station City Council is scheduled to meet on Thursday to continue discussions on the proposal. Dozens of residents are expected to attend, with many of them planning to speak out in opposition to the proposal.

The decisions postponed BlackRock's Ethereum staking proposal alongside Franklin Templeton's spot XRP and Solana ETF applications.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed decisions on three crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Sept. 10.

The decisions postponed BlackRock's Ethereum staking proposal alongside Franklin Templeton's spot XRP and Solana ETF applications. The delays come as the SEC develops a generic listing framework that could streamline future crypto ETF approvals.

The postponements position these applications for potential approval during an anticipated October batch decision window, aligning with previous predictions.

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted in April that crypto ETFs would likely get a batch of approvals in October, when some of the over 90 filings reach their final deadlines.

The SEC has been working with US exchanges on a standardized listing framework for token-based ETFs that would eliminate individual rule-change requests for qualifying assets.

The initiative would allow ETF sponsors to bypass the customary Form 19b-4 process when underlying tokens meet predetermined criteria.

Under the proposed framework, sponsors would submit registration statements on Form S-1, observe standard 75-day review periods, and list products once the waiting periods have ended.

Market capitalization, on-exchange trading volume, and daily liquidity represent key metrics under discussion for qualification thresholds. The current rule-change pathway requires each spot crypto ETF to secure a Commission order before listing, a process designed for novel or complex products.

Moving to standing rules for qualifying assets would shorten timelines and reduce iterative comment cycles between the agency and applicants.

Eric Balchunas said on Sept. 9 that the “memecoin ETF era [is] about to kick off” with a Dogecoin ETF slated for launch on Sept. 11 under the 40 Act structure.

Balchunas said this could potentially become “the first-ever US ETF to hold something that has no utility on purpose,” considering Dogecoin was originally created as a tribute to the Doge meme.

A successful Dogecoin ETF launch could catalyze broader approval momentum for pending applications.

Seyffart previously shared that there are 92 crypto ETF applications divided across various assets, including Solana, XRP, Litecoin, and staking versions of existing products awaiting SEC decisions.

The comprehensive filing list reveals applications from major issuers, including VanEck, Grayscale, Canary, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton, covering assets ranging from established cryptocurrencies to emerging tokens.

Nature Reviews Drug Discovery

                         (2025)Cite this article


Synthetic lethality, first proposed more than two decades ago, has long held immense promise for targeted cancer therapy. Although the clinical success of PARP inhibition in BRCA-mutant cancers stands as proof of concept, few other synthetic lethal interactions have been translated from preclinical findings into effective therapies. This slow pace of translation stems in part from the difficulty of developing drugs against genetic dependencies, but also reflects the cell- and tissue-specific nature of these interactions. In this Review, we outline recent advances in the discovery and validation of synthetic lethal pairs, from their discovery in large-scale genetic screens to the development of drugs for the clinic. We discuss how alternative CRISPR-based approaches — including combinatorial screens, base editing and saturation mutagenesis — are now being used to discover new tractable interactions. We also examine how machine learning models can enable prioritization of candidate pairs and the identification of biomarkers for patient stratification. Finally, we highlight alternative phenotypic readouts, such as high-content imaging and single-cell profiling, which enable the dissection of phenotypes beyond simple cell growth or fitness. Together, these developments are refining the synthetic lethality paradigm and advancing its potential for cancer therapy.

Magic Mushroom Edibles Found to Contain Undisclosed Ingredients—And No Psilocybin

Researchers tested 12 “magic mushroom” edibles. None contained psilocybin, but most contained undisclosed ingredients, including synthetic drugs whose safety hasn't been tested in humans

Researchers tested 12 “magic mushroom” edible products sold in Portland, Ore., and found no trace of psilocybin, the hallucinogenic compound that gives magic mushrooms their name. Instead seven of the products contained at least one undisclosed active ingredient. Such ingredients included cannabis extract and synthetic psychedelics whose effects and safety have not been formally documented or studied.

“We found no evidence of mushroom compounds of any kind, coming from any species,” says the new study's co-author Richard van Breemen, a pharmaceutical sciences professor at Oregon State University. The research was published on Thursday in JAMA Network Open.

Psilocybin and other psychedelic drugs have received a lot of attention in recent years as potential treatments for mental health conditions such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. “There's a lot of hype around these substances, so people are increasingly trying them outside current legal pathways,” says Lori Bruce, a bioethicist at Yale University, who researches psychedelics.

In June 2024 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the agency was investigating reports of severe illness after people consumed certain purported psilocybin edibles. By last October, 73 hospitalizations and three deaths—all possibly associated with such products—had been reported across 34 states. “The mislabeling highlighted in this [study] causes harms,” Bruce says. “And as usage rates increase across the U.S., harms from retail products are also likely to increase.”

Psilocybin comes from several mushroom species, including some in the genus Psilocybe. When consumed, the body breaks down the compound into psilocin, an alkaloid that can cause startling visual hallucinations and psychological effects, often including intense introspection. The U.S. federal government classifies both psilocybin and psilocin as Schedule I drugs, meaning they're deemed to have a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use.

But a handful of states have recently legalized the manufacture, sale, possession and use of psilocybin under certain conditions. Both medical and recreational use are legal in Colorado, and New Mexico passed a law this year that legalizes certain medical uses. In Oregon the regulations are stricter: the drug must be taken in the company of a licensed facilitator at a specific “psilocybin service center.” These centers receive psilocybin from licensed growers, whose products are tested by a licensed laboratory.

Oregon does not allow the sale or use of psilocybin products outside of these centers; it is otherwise a criminal offense to buy, sell or possess the drug in the state. But the legal channels are prohibitively expensive to many: the average trip costs somewhere between $750 and $1,200.

This dynamic may be leading more people to try purported psilocybin products that are untested and prohibited but nonetheless sold at some retail stores, says legal researcher Mason Marks, a law professor at Florida State University who focused on psychedelics. “A lot of people are very curious about these substances. And if you're in a state, like Oregon, that does not decriminalize them, people might go to these shops and buy these products that are either blatantly illegal or kind of in this gray area.”

For the new study, the researchers purchased 12 edible products (11 gummies and a chocolate) that were advertised as containing “magic mushrooms” and were sold at gas stations and convenience stores in Portland. These products are “being marketed widely in local convenience stores and on the Internet,” van Breemen says.

The edibles were first tested at a state-licensed facility that normally certifies the quality of the drug for Oregon's psilocybin service centers. None of the products contained any psilocybin at all. To determine what they actually did contain, van Breemen and his colleagues turned to more advanced mass spectrometry techniques.

Seven products contained undisclosed active ingredients such as caffeine, kava extract (a legal herbal supplement with antianxiety and hallucinogenic effects) and cannabis extract (including the plant's main psychoactive ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC). Four of the gummies contained no active ingredients at all.

Two of the gummies did contain psilocin, which also occurs naturally in some mushrooms in small quantities—and which is easier to synthesize in a laboratory than psilocybin. If the psilocin in the edibles came from natural sources, the researchers would expect to also detect other, related compounds from mushrooms. Such compounds turned out to be absent, leading van Breemen and his colleagues to conclude that the psilocin was likely synthetic.

Of greatest concern to the researchers, though, was the identification of synthetic psychedelic, or “syndelic,” compounds in two of the gummies. These drugs, mipracetin and 4-hydroxy-diethyltryptamine, have a chemical structure that is similar to that of psilocybin and psilocin and are psychoactive. Their effects on the body have not been studied in humans. "We don't know what harm they might cause,” van Breemen says.

Van Breemen was surprised by the extent of the mislabeling. “Over the years, we've tested many botanical dietary supplements,” he says. “Rarely do you find 12 products, none of which contain what they're supposed to contain. So the sample number is small, but the number of mislabeled or adulterated products was significant.”

This is an “important and timely study,” Bruce says. “Psychedelics show initial promise for intractable mental health disorders, but science is still teasing out who will benefit and who will be harmed from their psychedelics experience.” The Trump administration has indicated an interest in deregulating psychedelics for therapeutic purposes. In this context, Bruce adds, “the concerns I raise may become more widespread.”

While we know much of the story of how humans evolved, the puzzle is still missing critical pieces. For example, fossil evidence for human evolution between 2 and 3 million years ago is patchy. It's frustrating because we know that the branch of the hominin family tree that includes humans, or Homo sapiens, appears in the fossil record for the first time in this period.

Today, Homo sapiens (which anthropologists shorten to Homo), is the only hominin species alive. But in the past, Homo wasn't alone. We coexisted and competed with other branches of the human family tree. Research supported by the National Science Foundation and the Leakey Foundation and published in Nature now fills in a piece of the ongoing evolutionary puzzle, placing two early species of hominin side-by-side.

A team working in the Afar Region of Ethiopia, at the site of Ledi-Geraru, reports hominin fossils that date between 2.6 and 3.0 million years old. Lucas Delezene, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Arkansas, was second author on a paper that incorporated the work of more than 20 researchers from North America, Africa and Europe.

The team found fossils of Homo that confirm the earliest evidence for the human lineage at 2.8 million years ago as well as evidence of Homo at 2.6 million years ago, solidifying the antiquity of Homo. Unexpectedly, the team also found evidence that Homo overlapped at the site with a different type of hominin, Australopithecus, at 2.6 million years ago.

This was a surprise because Australopithecus was thought to be extinct in the area by about 3 million years ago. The famous Australopithecus fossil known as Lucy was found at a nearby site, but her species disappeared from the fossil record at 3 million years ago.

"People often think evolution is a linear progression," explains Delezene, "like the March of Progress, but in reality humans are only one species that make up a twig of a bigger family tree -- it's quite bushy and what we found is another twig that was previously unknown. The idea that Homo appears and immediately spreads around the planet and replaces all other hominin species is not accurate. Homo lived side-by-side with many other hominin species throughout Africa. What's neat is that Homo overlaps with different hominin species in different places."

For example, from southern Ethiopia to southern Africa, the earliest species of Homo overlapped with a hominin known as Paranthropus, which is well known for its massive teeth and chewing muscles and a diet reliant on grass in some parts of its range. However, in the Afar Region of Ethiopia, no Paranthropus fossils have ever been found.

Instead, the team working at Ledi-Geraru found that Homo overlap with a different type of hominin, Australopithecus. How all of these hominin species divided up resources is the question of ongoing research. Did Homo nod to the other hominin species on their way to hunting and gathering in the morning, or did the various species consume similar resources? Did Homo eat the same things in Ethiopia where it coexisted with Australopithecus as it did in the south where it coexisted with Paranthropus, or was its diet flexible?

We know that Homo eventually becomes a culturally reliant tool user and occasionally consumed meat. But the oldest Homo fossils at Ledi-Geraru predate any evidence of tool manufacture or meat consumption. Did Homo evolve those traits to avoid competing with other hominin species? Competition among these various hominin species likely set the stage for the evolution of the traits that ultimately made humans a globally widespread and successful species.

The fossils published in the Nature paper are all teeth. Teeth are often the best-preserved fossils because their enamel coating provides better protection from the ravages of time and the elements.

Delezene, a hominin dental expert, says, "When we get down to the picky details, the teeth of Homo and Australopithecus look different. The differences are subtle, but once you see them, you can't unsee them. They're very consistent."

While the new fossils fill in a piece of the puzzle, there is still a long way to go before we have a complete picture of human evolution. While there is evidence for the teeth of early Homo and the new Australopithecus, the team doesn't know what their heads or the rest of their bodies looked like. The multi-national collaboration, done in partnership with the local community of Afar people, will continue its work looking for more fossils, ideally with continued funding.

Early Experiments Show Fast-Acting Antidote Targets Carbon Monoxide Poisoning

Carbon monoxide is a quiet assassin. Odorless and colorless, it has a uniquely efficient ability to starve the body of oxygen: It acts quickly, building up in the bloodstream and attaching to hemoglobin in oxygen's place. When oxygen can't attach, red blood cells don't transport it around the body, effectively suffocating the organs.

This gas, a common by-product of incomplete fuel combustion, causes 50,000 to 100,000 emergency room visits and 1,500 deaths in the U.S. each year. Typical treatment uses an oxygen mask or hyperbaric chamber to overwhelm the body with oxygen, pushing the carbon monoxide molecules off the hemoglobin cells so that oxygen can attach instead. It's effective, but it's slow—and while only a small percentage of people with carbon monoxide poisoning die, survivors are often left with brain damage, cardiac complications or kidney and liver problems from oxygen deprivation.

But new research suggests a faster antidote. A recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA documents a newly engineered protein therapy called RcoM-HBD-CCC; given intravenously to mice, it was shown to cling to carbon monoxide (CO) and expel the poison via the kidneys within minutes.

“We want a treatment that you can give in the field,” says study author Mark T. Gladwin, dean of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. He says RcoM-HBD-CCC could be injected into people on their way to the hospital in an ambulance or to people with low oxygen levels at the site of fires.

“This molecule becomes CO-bound pretty much as soon as you inject it,” says study co-author and University of Pittsburgh researcher Jesus Tejero. Because it has a much higher affinity for carbon monoxide than carbon monoxide has to hemoglobin, RcoM-HBD-CCC quickly sponges up the toxin. In addition to the mouse study, the researchers also confirmed that the protein quickly clung to carbon monoxide in human blood in test tubes.

Lance B. Becker, an emergency medicine researcher at the Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, who was not involved in the study, notes that the new protein binds to carbon monoxide—but not to nitric oxide, a gas molecule that plays a key role in relaxing blood vessels to improve blood flow. Gladwin and his team had previously engineered a protein with an affinity to carbon monoxide—but it also bound to nitric oxide, causing problematic artery stiffening in early mouse tests.

Becker hopes this treatment will prove effective in planned studies with larger animals and eventually in human trials, which are likely still a few years off. Though researchers won't know if it works in human bodies until they try it, Becker is optimistic. “It's a very clever little molecule if it pans out, he says.”

A multidimensional social exposome (MSE)—the combined lifespan measures of education, food insecurity, financial status, access to healthcare, childhood experiences, and more—may shape dementia risk and brain health over the lifespan, particularly in underserved regions like Latin America. However, the MSE effects on brain health and dementia are unknown. We evaluated 2211 individuals (controls, Alzheimer's disease, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration) from a non-representative sample across six Latin American countries. Adverse exposomes associate with poorer cognition in healthy aging. In dementia, more complex exposomes correlate with lower cognitive and functional performance, higher neuropsychiatric symptoms, and brain structural and connectivity alterations in frontal-temporal-limbic and cerebellar regions. Food insecurity, financial resources, subjective socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare emerge as critical predictors. Cumulative exposome measures surpass isolated factors in predicting clinical-cognitive profiles. Multiple sensitivity analyses confirm our results. Findings highlight the need for personalized approaches integrating MSE across the lifespan, emphasizing prevention and interventions targeting social disparities.

Poverty and socioeconomic disparities have multidimensional effects that can harm the brain through multiple pathways. The exposome refers to the totality of environmental, social, and biological exposures accumulated over a lifetime. Within this framework, the social exposome captures the cumulative and multidimensional impact of socially driven exposures that influence health outcomes1. These effects may exert a more substantial influence on aging and dementia than isolated risk factors2,3,4. For instance, individuals growing up in poverty may face limited educational opportunities and food insecurity, relying on low-cost, nutrient-poor diets that impair brain development3. In adulthood, chronic stress from traumatic events and financial insecurity may add to this burden5, while in older age, accumulated adverse exposures throughout life contribute to physiological dysregulation, increasing vulnerability to neurodegeneration. The cumulative burden of socially-related factors5 (e.g., low educational attainment, adverse childhood experiences, and traumatic events), aggravating factors (e.g., limited access to healthcare6), and affected domains (e.g., financial burden and reduced social interaction) may significantly exacerbate dementia phenotypes. These cumulative social burdens constitute the multidimensional social exposome (MSE)1, extending traditional factors such as education level and socioeconomic status (SES). Social determinants of health (SDH), which encompass some proxies of the social exposome, play a crucial role in brain health, healthy aging, and dementia2,7. SDH has been linked to the risk and prevalence of dementia, with education and SES being associated with core clinical and neurocognitive measures8,9. However, current research fails to characterize the MSE across different life stages10. Factors such as food insecurity, access to healthcare6, childhood experiences, and exposure to traumatic events11 may significantly contribute to dementia, but they have not been systematically addressed. In particular, the impact of the social exposome on core dimensions of brain health in aging and dementia—cognition, functional ability, neuropsychiatric manifestations, brain atrophy, and connectivity—remains unknown.

Latin America (LA) presents a wide spectrum of social and environmental factors that may influence late-life brain health outcomes. Heterogeneous and distributed factors associated with social and health disparities impact cognition and functional ability across LA7. These factors are linked to historical, sociopolitical, and sociocultural diversity12, as well as political polarization and its potential impact on health. The region has the second-highest estimated global prevalence of dementia13 and is one of the most unequal regions in the world, with significant disparities in both material and non-material social resources. These include financial assets, healthcare access, education, social support, and infrastructure12. Such inequality is reflected by Gini scores frequently surpassing 0.47, indicating considerable wealth inequality14. LA is typified by the intersection of unique educational challenges, food insecurity, childhood difficulties, healthcare inequalities, and adverse environments5,12. We have recently shown that in LA, inequalities are associated with worsening cognitive and functional phenotypes7, brain reserve15, and accelerated brain age2 in aging and dementia. Other reports suggest stronger effects of SDH than genetic ancestry for dementia risk in LA16. Thus, the social exposome in the region seems unique17. However, current research is limited to specific factors such as SES, education, or single macrosocial estimates2,7,14,15,16 usually investigated in isolation. Considering multidimensional lifespan measures, a cumulative social exposome assessment may be much more informative in capturing the heterogeneity and diversity of underserved populations facing multifocal adversities.

Significant gaps impede an adequate understanding of the MSE. Most evidence is based only on broad measures of education (years of schooling) and SES10, usually factored out as control variables rather than targeted as relevant phenomena8. Although valid, SES measures present multiple limitations10, such as inconsistent definitions (e.g., varying metrics for education, income, and profession), lack of standardization across contexts, and fragmentation of domains precluding the assessment of cumulative burdens. SDH research has neglected multimodal clinical-cognitive measures and their biological embedding of brain health10. The available evidence is biased toward the United States (US) and European data, with an underrepresentation of individuals suffering from larger disparities in countries with more diverse origins. Models based on data from high-income countries fail to capture brain and dementia phenotypes accurately and do not generalize well to more diverse populations, particularly in LA18. Though variously defined, brain health is consistently considered a multilevel construct encompassing brain structural and functional integrity, cognitive health, functional ability, and low levels of neuropsychiatric symptoms. There is a need to explore the various aspects of the social exposome and its impact on brain health outcomes in aging and dementia for underrepresented populations. This may help to develop tailored biopsychosocial models of dementia.

We aimed to address these gaps by employing an MSE approach (Fig. 1) to characterize brain health in aging and dementia in terms of cognition, functional ability, neuropsychiatric symptoms, brain volume, and functional connectivity in a non-representative sample of 2211 individuals across 6 LA countries, including healthy controls (HC), patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) (Table 1). These two conditions are among the leading causes of dementia and are critically underrepresented in research from LA. We created a multidimensional score leveraging expert criteria, factorial confirmatory analysis, and structural equation modeling of combined variables in different domains (education, food insecurity, financial status, assets, access to healthcare, childhood labor, subjective SES, childhood experiences, traumatic events, and relationship assessments). Each dimension included a combination of various components across different life stages (from birth to present). For instance, food insecurity assessed whether the participant had to eat less or less healthily due to economic hardship from 0 to 10, 35 to 45 years old, and recently. Access to healthcare is considered an item evaluating challenges in paying for services from 0 to 10, 35 to 45 years old, and recently, including specific barriers such as economic reasons, medical appointment availability, transportation, distance to medical facilities, lack of accompaniment, the COVID-19 pandemic, or socio-political events. Childhood experiences covered the number of children in the household, whether the participant left school to support the family, the frequency of feeling loved and receiving physical affection during childhood, and family conflicts. The MSE also included exposure to alcohol and/or drug abuse in the household, experiences of neglect during childhood, and household organization (see Dimensions in MSE assessment). We anticipated that adverse MSE would have an extensive effect on brain health, including (a) poor cognition, reduced functional ability, and increased neuropsychiatric symptoms; (b) a more substantial impact than individual classical predictors (e.g., education, income); and (c) larger brain atrophy and reduced functional connectivity in dementia-sensitive brain regions for AD and FTLD.

a Healthy controls (HC) and participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) were recruited from six Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. b The assessment protocol included a comprehensive multidimensional social exposome (MSE) evaluation alongside clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging measures. For MSE quantification, all items underwent imputation for missing values (NaN) and were then min-max scaled between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating lower levels of social adversity. Composite scores for each participant were calculated by averaging variables within specific categories: education, food insecurity, financial status, assets, access to healthcare, childhood labor, subjective socioeconomic status (SES), childhood experiences, traumatic events, and relationships. c These domain-specific scores, ranging from 0 to 1, served as inputs in structural equation models (SEM) to predict cognitive function, functional ability, and neuropsychiatric symptoms in the whole sample (green), HC (yellow), AD (purple), and FTLD (red). d The global MSE score, extracted from the latent variable, was employed to predict brain structure and functional connectivity. The coverage of regions within the top clusters identified in whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analyses using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was examined. Specific regions may include the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), insula (INS), rolandic operculum (ROL), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACG). In resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) analyses, region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI connectivity was assessed by identifying the top regions with the highest number of connections. For illustration purposes, critical regions such as the cerebellum (CCRU cerebellum crus, CER cerebellum lobule), and middle frontal gyrus (MFG) are highlighted. All analyses were controlled for age, sex, total intracranial volume (TIV, for voxel-based morphometry analyses), and scanner. Created in BioRender. Migeot, J. (2025) https://BioRender.com/rxcmtgq (sample size, assessment protocol, covariate icons and MRI device).

The MSE was operationalized by grouping items measuring facets of similar dimensions based on expert consensus agreement. Then, we calculated the weighted averages on these items to create dimension scores for education, food insecurity, financial status, assets, healthcare access, childhood labor, subjective SES, childhood experiences, traumatic events, and relationships. These scores were obtained by scaling between the minimum and maximum values for 319 items and then averaging these to obtain a value for each dimension (Fig. 1B). We validated these dimensions via confirmatory analysis. Structural equation modeling was fed with these composite factors to create a global latent MSE score per subject (Fig. 1C). To examine whether the combined MSE effects were stronger than, and not driven by, single factors influencing the global score, we tested the contributions of individual predictors with Lasso models. Then, we compared them with the global MSE score via meta-regressions. The structural and functional brain correlates of the MSE scores were tested in a subsample with whole-brain gray matter volume and ROI-to-ROI functional connectivity (Fig. 1D). Multiple sensitivity analyses were employed to confirm that the results were not biased by individual dimensions or traditional SES factors, demographic, recruitment bias, disease-related factors (age, sex, disease severity, age at diagnosis, years after diagnosis, and FTLD subtype); or scanner effects (scanner type, signal-to-noise ratio, and motion parameters).

For the entire sample (Fig. 2A), the larger the adverse MSE, the worse the negative outcomes (cognition, functional ability, and neuropsychiatric symptoms: CFI = 0.939, TLI = 0.893, RMSEA = 0.076, and SRMR = 0.049). The global score of adverse MSE was associated with diminished cognitive function (β = 0.261 [95% CI = 0.18–0.282], p < 0.001), decreased functional ability (β = 0.079 [95% CI = 0.015–0.11], p < 0.001), and heightened neuropsychiatric symptoms (β = 0.105 [95% CI = 0.033–0.132], p < 0.001). Top MSE indicators included education (β = 0.732 [95% CI = 0.685–0.778], p < 0.001), followed by food insecurity (β = 0.702 [95% CI = 0.658–0.745], p < 0.001), financial status (β = 0.694 [95% CI = 0.659–0.730], p < 0.001), assets (β = 0.649 [95% CI = 0.610–0.687], p < 0.001), and access to healthcare (β = 0.506 [95% CI = 0.456–0.557]) (Supplementary Table 1).

SEM between the multidimensional social exposome (MSE) and cognitive status, functional ability and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Top factor loadings (exact p-values: education = 1 × 10−308; food insecurity = 1 × 10−308; financial status =  1 × 10−308; assets = 1 × 10−308; childhood labor = 1 × 10−308; subjective SES = 1 × 10−308; childhood experiences = 1 × 10−308; traumatic events = 1 × 10−15; relations = 1 × 10−8) and distribution of association with outcomes for a the whole sample (green), b healthy controls (HC, yellow), c persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD, purple) and d frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD, red). No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. The SEM was implemented as a two-sided model by default. Functional ability and neuropsychiatric symptoms score were inverted to facilitate the interpretability of associations relative to the cognitive status score, so that the higher the value, the higher the functional capacity and the lower the neuropsychiatric symptoms.

In healthy aging, adverse MSE was linked to lower cognitive function (β = 0.610 [95% CI = 0.463–0.737], p < 0.001) but did not predict functional ability (β = −0.047 [95% CI = −0.026 to 0.073], p = 0.101) nor neuropsychiatric symptoms (β = −0.032 [95% CI = −0.114 to −0.002], p = 0.259) (Fig. 2B). The model showed lower fit indices with CFI = 0.859, TLI = 0.756, RMSEA = 0.105, and SRMR = 0.092. Key MSE indicators encompassed assets (β = 0.924 [95% CI = 0.880–0.967], p < 0.001), education (β = 0.921 [95% CI = 0.865–0.976], p < 0.001), financial status (β = 0.526 [95% CI = 0.477–0.574], p < 0.001), childhood labor (β = 0.440 [95% CI = 0.388–0.491], p < 0.001), and food insecurity (β = 0.373 [95% CI = 0.302–0.444], p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Table 1).

In individuals with AD, adverse MSE was associated with lower cognitive function (β = 0.229 [95% CI = 0.157–0.309], p < 0.001), reduced functional ability (β = 0.079 [95% CI = 0.004–0.152], p = 0.038), and an increase in neuropsychiatric symptoms (β = 0.104 [95% CI = 0.013–0.193], p = 0.007) (Fig. 2C). The model obtained excellent fit indices with CFI = 0.955, TLI = 0.922, RMSEA = 0.058, and SRMR = 0.041. The leading MSE indicators were education (β = 0.800 [95% CI = 0.730–0.869], p < 0.001), food insecurity (β = 0.716 [95% CI = 0.650–0.782], p < 0.001), assets (β = 0.683 [95% CI = 0.621–0.745], p < 0.001), financial status (β = 0.643 [95% CI = 0.583– 0.703], p < 0.001), and subjective SES (β = 0.534 [95% CI = 0.476–0.593], p < 0.001) (Fig. 2C, Supplementary Table 1).

For those with FTLD, adverse MSE predicted decreased cognitive function (β = 0.165 [95% CI = 0.037–0.289], p = 0.017), reduced functional ability (β = 0.140 [95% CI = 0.015–0.288], p = 0.040), and increased neuropsychiatric symptoms (β = 0.141 [95% CI = 0.019–0.281], p = 0.040) (Fig. 2D). The model showed excellent fit indices with CFI = 0.985, TLI = 0.973, RMSEA = 0.036, and SRMR = 0.041. The most critical MSE indicators comprised education (β = 0.796 [95% CI = 0.698–0.895], p < 0.001), financial status (β = 0.691 [95% CI = 0.598–0.784], p < 0.001), subjective SES (β = 0.675 [95% CI = 0.589–0.762], p < 0.001), assets (β = 0.666 [95% CI = 0.569–0.763], p < 0.001), and access to healthcare (β = 0.626 [95% CI = 0.511–0.742], p < 0.001) (Fig. 2D, Supplementary Table 1).

In summary, adverse MSE was related to impairments in cognitive, functional, and neuropsychiatric domains. The most significant adverse MSE predictors in healthy aging were assets, education, and financial status, associated with lower cognitive function. In dementia, the importance of MSE predictors was more distributed across the different domains.

When individual predictors were assessed for the entire sample using Lasso regression, a reduced effect across outcomes was observed compared to the global MSE score (all p < 0.01, Table 2). For cognitive function (R2 = 0.11, f 2 = 0.13, MnSqErr = 0.02, MAE = 0.12), the top predictors were education (coef = 0.23), assets (coef = 0.09), and childhood experiences (coef = 0.02). Similarly, a reduced effect was noted for functional ability (R2 = 0.04, f2 = 0.04, MnSqErr = 0.05, MAE = 0.18), with subjective SES (coef = 0.16), education (coef = 0.12), and access to healthcare (coef = 0.11) emerging as key predictors. For neuropsychiatric symptoms (R2 = 0.03, f2 = 0.03, MnSqErr = 0.03, MAE = 0.13), access to healthcare (coef = 0.14), childhood experiences (coef = 0.09), and subjective SES (coef = 0.05) were identified as leading predictors (Supplementary Table 2).

This pattern of reduced effects of individual predictors compared to the global MSE score was consistent between groups (all p < 0.01, Table 2). For healthy aging, reduced effects for cognition were observed (R2 = 0.43, f2 = 0.75, MnSqErr = 0.01, MAE = 0.05), with education (coef = 0.14) and assets (coef = 0.26) being prominent contributors. Among individuals with AD, a reduced effect (R2 = 0.06, f2 = 0.07, MnSqErr = 0.02, MAE = 0.10) highlighted education (coef = 0.18), food insecurity (coef = 0.03), and access to healthcare (coef = 0.02) as key predictors. For those with FTLD, a reduced effect (R2 = 0.04, f2 = 0.04, MnSqErr = 0.03, MAE = 0.14) was linked to childhood experiences (coef = 0.08), childhood labor (coef = 0.03), and education (coef = 0.04) (Supplementary Table 2).

Regarding functional ability in AD (R2 = 0.01, f2 = 0.01, MnSqErr = 0.05, MAE = 0.18), subjective SES (coef = 0.08) was the primary predictor. For FTLD (R2 = 0.05, f2 = 0.05, MnSqErr = 0.06, MAE = 0.20), financial status (coef = 0.17), relations (coef = 0.15), and childhood labor (coef = 0.08) were the top contributors. In the context of neuropsychiatric symptoms, AD showed a reduced effect (R2 = 0.02, f2 = 0.02, MnSqErr = 0.03, MAE = 0.13), with food insecurity (coef = 0.05), childhood experiences (coef = 0.05), and access to healthcare (coef = 0.01) as leading predictors. For FTLD (R2 = 0.05, f2 = 0.05, MnSqErr = 0.04, MAE = 0.16), traumatic events (coef = 0.29), financial status (coef = 0.13), and childhood labor (coef = 0.07) were identified as top predictors (Supplementary Table 2). Thus, the cumulative MSE effects were neither driven by nor weaker than any independent effects.

In individuals with AD, more adverse MSE was linked to reduced gray matter volume in frontal and cerebellar regions, with the highest cluster peak values observed in the superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyrus, vermis (lobules IV–VI), cerebellum (crus I and II, lobule VIIb and VIII), and insula (Fig. 3A, Table 3). A closer inspection of the regions covered in the top clusters revealed the Rolandic operculum, gyrus rectus, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, and the putamen, which showed a stable association between less adverse MSE and higher gray matter volumes of each top cluster (Fig. 3A).

a Whole-brain analysis for persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD, purple) shows regions with significant associations between the multidimensional social exposome (MSE) and gray matter volume (GMV), highlighted by threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) values. Circular barplot charts are included for the top cluster, indicating the percentage coverage of the top region within the cluster. Scatterplots illustrate the relationship between MSE scores and clusters' GMV. b Whole-brain analysis for persons with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD, red) highlights regions significantly associated with MSE, with TFCE values similarly visualized. Corresponding scatterplots depict the associations between MSE scores and GMV for each identified cluster. In the scatter plots, each point represents an individual observation.

For those with FTLD, larger adverse MSE was associated with decreased gray matter volume in fronto-temporo-cerebellar regions. The highest cluster peaks were found in the vermis (lobule IV, V, and VII), superior temporal gyrus, superior and middle frontal gyrus, and anterior cingulate cortex (Fig. 3B, Table 4). Coverage of top cluster regions identified the cerebellum (crus I and II, lobule IV, V, VI, VIII, and IX), Rolandic operculum, insula, Heschl's gyrus, and postcentral gyrus. A consistent link was found between fewer adverse MSE and increased gray matter volumes in each top cluster (Fig. 3B).

In individuals with AD, more adverse MSE was associated with lower frontotemporal connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, striatum, insula, and cerebellum (lobule III and vermis lobule III). Conversely, greater MSE adversity was associated with higher connectivity between frontal (superior, middle, inferior), temporal (middle), occipital (middle, cuneus), and cingulate regions (Fig. 4A, Supplementary Table 3). The middle temporal, cingulate, and superior frontal gyrus had the most connections (Fig. 4A).

The connectome ring provides a simplified visualization of interconnections between key regions. The circular barplot chart highlights the top regions with the highest number of connections in this group (purple). b In persons with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), ROI-to-ROI connectivity maps similarly provide visualizations of significant connections associated with MSE, with the connectome ring displaying interconnections between key regions and a circular barplot chart showing key regions with the highest number of connections in this group (red).

In FTLD, more adverse MSE was associated with lower frontotemporal connectivity primarily between frontal (superior, middle, and inferior, precentral gyrus), temporal (superior, parahippocampal gyrus), limbic (amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate cortex), and cerebellar regions (crus I, lobule III, IV-V, IX, and X). Greater MSE adversity was associated with higher connectivity in frontal (superior, middle, inferior), temporal (superior, middle, inferior, and parahippocampal gyrus), hippocampus, and cerebellar regions (crus I, lobule IV–V, VI, and X) was observed (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Table 4). The regions with the highest number of connections were the hippocampus, inferior and superior frontal gyrus, and cingulate gyrus (Fig. 4B).

Multiple effects were tested to confirm the robustness of our analysis. The association between adverse MSE with reduced cognition and functional ability and increased neuropsychiatric symptoms was preserved (all p < 0.01) after controlling for the effect of demographics, potential recruitment bias, and dementia-related covariates (age, sex, disease severity, age at diagnosis, years after diagnosis, and FTLD subtype; Supplementary Table 5). Despite an unbalanced distribution of age and sex across groups (Table 1), all effects remained consistent after controlling for these covariates. Moreover, none of these covariates were associated with the MSE score (all p > 0.10), confirming that potential confounders did not drive the main effects (Supplementary Table 5). The associations between adverse MSE with reduced cognition and functional ability and increased neuropsychiatric symptoms were preserved (all p < 0.01) after controlling for country level (Supplementary Information 1). Additional models were run to rule out potential bias from single factors linked to worse clinical-cognitive phenotypes (i.e., education and SES). Excluding education from the global MSE score confirmed that the association between adverse MSE and reduced cognition remained significant (Supplementary Information 2). Furthermore, models considering only objective or subjective SES showed lower fit indices and weaker associations than MSE in predicting cognition, functional ability, and neuropsychiatric symptoms (Supplementary Information 3). In summary, the robustness of our findings was supported through multiple approaches, including the validation of MSE dimensions, controlling for key covariates, and assessing cross-country consistency. MSE models demonstrated better fit and predictive power than SES-only models, and the effects persisted even when education was excluded from the MSE or missing values were not imputed.

To control the effects of different scanners, scanner type was included as a dummy covariate of no interest among the predictors in whole-brain gray matter volume and ROI-to-ROI functional connectivity analyses14, thus corroborating that scanner type did not explain findings (Tables 3 and 4, Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). The observed effects in whole-brain gray matter volume and ROI-to-ROI functional connectivity analyses were robust to imbalances in age and sex distribution across groups. Consistent results were observed while controlling for these covariates in the regression models (Tables 3 and 4, Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). We also explored the association between MSE and f/MRI data quality metrics (Methods, Sensitivity analysis). Across all subjects, MSE was not associated with either spatial (MRI: r = 0.002, p = 0.958; fMRI: r = −0.063, p = 0.183) or temporal (r = 0.005, p = 0.912) signal-to-noise ratio nor motion parameters (r = −0.076, p = 0.088). The same null effects were observed across groups (all p > 0.113) (Supplementary Table 6). Further, we tested separate models excluding participants with less than 70% of artifact-free frames19. Results replicated the main functional connectivity effects (Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). In addition to the primary analyses, we ran additional voxel-based morphometry models employing a harmonization strategy that normalized the voxel intensity values for MRI scans2. The results of this harmonization closely matched those from the main results, as the associations with the core regions were preserved (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). To provide a framework for replication with previous evidence on functional connectivity in LA populations2,14,15,20,21,22,23,24, we ran additional models employing the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas. Results matched the connectivity patterns described in the main results (Supplementary Information 4, Supplementary Tables 11 and 12). All analyses were controlled by age, sex, and total intracranial volume (for voxel-based morphometry analyses). Multiple comparisons were false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected.

This study aimed to identify the association of MSE and brain health outcomes in aging and dementia in LA. We found that the more adverse the MSE, the larger the cognitive, functional, and neuropsychiatric impairment. The combined effects of MSE components demonstrated stronger associations, even after excluding education. The stronger model fit and greater magnitude of associations for MSE compared to SES alone underscored a cumulative multidimensional burden. The top predictors in healthy aging were composite measures of education and assets, whereas, in dementia, more multidimensional exposomes emerged, such as food insecurity, financial status, subjective SES, and access to healthcare. Adverse MSE were linked to the structure and functional connectivity of dementia-specific regions in AD and FTLD, predominantly fronto-temporo-limbic and cerebellar regions. Potential compensatory functional hyperconnectivity, characterized by higher functional connectivity associated with higher MSE adversity, was observed primarily in regions with reduced volume that were associated with more adverse MSE. Variations in participants' country of origin, demographic and dementia-related factors, image acquisition methods, or signal quality did not account for the results. Cross-country and cross-site effects did not influence the link between MSE and clinical, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric outcomes. Results demonstrate that the MSE, as a combined measure, exhibits stronger effects than individual factors and composite SES measures, providing a low-dimensional representation of the cumulative social exposome. The findings highlight how diverse data and tailored modeling can capture precise brain health outcomes of aging and dementia, crucial for efficient prevention and multicomponent interventions addressing both individual- and societal-level determinants.

While some studies have assessed the influence of SES7, nutrition, relationships7, access to healthcare, and traumatic experiences on functional ability and neuropsychiatric symptoms in aging, we evaluated their complex cumulative effects across the lifespan, ranging from birth to the present time. We expanded the classical assessments of SDH25 by including food insecurity, access to healthcare, subjective SES, and a weighted and lifespan evaluation of these factors. For instance, most previous studies8,9 have used years of education, and we expanded these effects with a combined measure that incorporates multiple domains (school type and location, perceived education quality throughout life, the number of books at home during childhood, parental education levels, and years of formal schooling). Financial status captured the difficulty in covering basic needs, the sufficiency of income at the end of the month, the diversity of income sources, the proportion of income spent on housing, and the participant's financial resilience in the event of lost income from 0 to 10, 35 to 45 years old, and recently (see Dimensions in MSE assessment). This approach allowed us to address complex cumulative effects. In healthy aging, cognition was mainly modulated by traditional factors such as education, assets, and financial status7,26 as assessed with complex measures. Our approach considered the combined influence of traditional (e.g., educational achievement and financial status) and non-traditional factors for each dimension, such as parental education, rurality, education quality, financial stress, food insecurity, difficulties in accessing healthcare6, childhood experiences, exposure to traumatic events11, and relationships7. Each factor has been studied individually, but not combined into a composite exposome measure to assess its association with brain health. Thus, our approach allowed us to examine the cumulative effects of multiple dimensions via the MSE. The impact on functional ability and neuropsychiatric symptoms in aging was null, probably due to the floor effect of these measures (see below). While factors like food insecurity, access to healthcare, childhood experiences, and subjective SES were significant predictors, the stronger contribution of classical factors probably reflects regional inequalities. Formal education is the main modifiable risk factor for dementia in LA27, associated with marked inequalities between the US and low-middle income countries, and critically differentiates aging and dementia brain outcomes in LA vs. the US15. SES is the second most burdensome disparity-related factor across LA regarding cognition7, probably by reducing cognitive reserve in older adults26. Current results support the role of education in preventing cognitive decline and dementia, this time involving intergenerational and quality-based measures. Moreover, results call for brain capital policy initiatives1; without systematically decreasing the structural inequalities14, the adverse individual-level effects on brain and cognitive health in the region cannot be properly addressed.

Different exposomes impact clinical, cognitive, and brain outcomes in healthy aging28 and dementia4. Physical exposome factors—such as lead exposure, microplastics, heatwaves, and air pollution—affect cognitive performance and brain structure. Lifestyle exposomes, including physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and cognitive engagement in late life, are associated with dementia risk3. Specific components related to social exposome—including education, social isolation, socioeconomic status (SES), and structural inequality—have been linked to cognition, functional ability7, and alterations in brain structure and functional connectivity2,14,15. The complex social exposome in AD29 and FTLD4 suggests a lifespan cumulative influence3,30,31,32. These effects can lead to accumulated dysregulation across different life stages, predisposing individuals to neurodegeneration in aging. Components of adverse social exposome in AD are associated with dysregulated stress responses, linked with reduced cognition, impaired functional ability, increased neuropsychiatric symptoms, and brain burden33. Elevated plasma cortisol levels, indicative of HPA axis dysregulation, have been associated with reduced total brain volume, decreased glucose metabolism in the frontal cortex, and increased beta-amyloid load in AD-vulnerable regions34,35. Emerging evidence in FTLD links altered stress responses with neurodegenerative processes via multisystemic dysregulations31,32. Overall, our MSE approach offers a combined and granular characterization of the social exposome in dementia. This work supports current efforts to define the broader dementia exposome4, enabling more precise risk profiling.

The brain correlates of adverse MSE in dementia align with disease-specific environmental explanations for pathophysiological mechanisms in AD. These suggest lower resistance to p-tau and Aβ burden across frontotemporal regions associated with lifetime stressful events33, stress-mediated impaired insulin signaling and cerebellar vulnerability30, and inflammatory models of clinical progression33. Regarding brain connectivity, our results showed similar associations with those reported with physical exposome2, education15, and structural inequalities14 in dementia. There is little evidence on environmental stress and FTLD phenotypes, suggesting a substantial genetic contribution to this condition17. However, FTLD brain health outcomes were linked with the social exposome in this study. Evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms suggests that the brain burden observed in FTLD may be driven by the accumulation of physiological stressors over time. Cerebellar gray matter patterns with posterior involvement are associated with educational disparities15 and structural inequality14. Evidence on pathophysiological mechanisms links the brain burden to the accumulation of physiological stressors (i.e., allostatic overload) in FTLD31,32 and also relates it to SDH2,14,15, targeting both disease-specific and non-specific regions. Environmental stressors can impact distributed brain regions while accelerating specific pathophysiological processes related to dementia2,14,15,21. In AD, progressive amyloid and tau pathology affect frontal and parietal structures, potentially amplifying the effects of MSE disrupting executive and integrative processes related to cognitive, functional, and neuropsychiatric impairments33,34,35. In FTLD, early degeneration targets fronto-temporo-limbic networks, leading to connectivity disruptions underlying socioemotional dysregulation, behavioral changes, and similar clinical outcomes. MSE may primarily exacerbate AD structural vulnerability through cumulative stress and resource depletion, whereas in FTLD, they predominantly could aggravate functional connectivity dysregulation. These neurobiological pathways may suggest that MSE can be linked with partially comparable clinical outcomes despite differing structural and functional correlates. Conversely, greater functional connectivity is associated with greater MSE adversity is aligned with evidence on compensatory effects in AD36 and FTLD37, as well as aversity-related factors such as socioeconomic status38, financial stress39, and discrimination40. This may reflect a compensatory process triggered by brain burdens associated with (a) neurodegenerative processes36,37, (b) disease-specific environmental factors contributing to pathophysiological mechanisms30,31,32, and (c) their interactions. In line with the prolonged accumulation of amyloid and tau pathology and with environmental exposures linked to the later onset of AD33,34,35, stronger compensatory functional connectivity associated with greater MSE adversity was observed in this group compared to FTLD. This may reflect the longer-lasting impact of degenerative and environmental burdens on brain structural signatures (atrophy) in AD, whereas in FTLD, more transient compensatory changes may emerge earlier in the disease course due to its typically younger onset. In addition to the disease-sensitive associations in each condition, we found additional cerebellar involvement in structural correlations. Although sometimes neglected in the literature41, the cerebellum is a core structure in atrophy related to dementia41 and environmental stressors such as low-SES9, structural inequality14, and poverty42. This may also explain why the cerebellum is part of the allostatic interoceptive network, which is impaired in individuals with dementia21,31,43,44 and those with social disparities32,38. Thus, allostatic interoception provides a framework for understanding the dual impact of dementia pathophysiology and social adversity. Overall, our findings deepen the association between social exposome and brain health outcomes in dementia in LA.

Our study has several strengths. We provided comprehensive coverage of social exposome dimensions and extensive brain health phenotyping of aging and dementia beyond current approaches that usually only consider traditional and unidimensional measures (e.g., years of education, basic SES scores), specific life periods (i.e., aging), or unimodal phenotypes. The cumulative lifespan of social exposome provides an understanding of the long-term impacts on brain health and dementia. We leveraged a large and geographically diverse sample across LA encompassing six countries with varying characteristics, surpassing the size of those typically found in current research in a region with marked inequalities14,16. Our protocol was harmonized across settings, and multiple sensitivity analyses confirmed robust results against heterogeneities in demographics (age and sex), country of origin, disease-related factors and recruitment bias (disease severity, age at diagnosis, years after diagnosis, FTLD subtype), and scanner effects (scanner type, signal-to-noise ratio, and motion parameters). Recruitment bias—factors that may influence the distribution of MSE scores during participant recruitment—could influence the results. However, several reasons suggest this is not the case, as we performed multiple control analyses. These included: (a) accounting for variations in disease severity, age at diagnosis, and time elapsed since diagnosis to mitigate potential overrepresentation of participants from disadvantaged groups in more advanced disease stages; (b) eliminating circularity in the assessment of MSE by excluding variables that may confound socioeconomic disparities with dementia outcomes (e.g., access to specific services such as cell phones could indicate either socioeconomic disparities or the consequences of cognitive decline); and (c) conducting within-group analyses to identify MSE associations through a dimensional approach rather than presuming uniform patterns across groups. However, future studies should incorporate other probabilistic or stratified random sampling strategies in the designs. The findings demonstrate the need for diverse data and tailored modeling to capture brain health outcomes of aging and dementia, crucial for more efficient prevention and interventions.

These strengths are accompanied by limitations that invite further research. While our MSE assessment considers different life stages, it relies on participant self-report, which could introduce bias. This is a limitation of the broader field of dementia assessment through self-report methods. We partially addressed this issue by omitting items from the evaluation that can be biased by dementia symptomatology (e.g., smartphone use, occupational situation, Supplementary Information 5) and corroborating participant self-reports with information provided by caregivers. This is consistent with standard practices for questionnaire-based assessments in individuals with dementia, such as evaluating depressive symptoms45, quality of life46, and activities of daily living47. Additionally, we controlled the impact of disease severity on these predictors to minimize confounding effects. Longitudinal designs and objective retrospective records may confirm and expand the current results. While our MSE assessment considers different life stages, items were limited to early, middle, and late life (0–10, 35–45 years old, and recently), leaving out other age periods. This approach was taken to ensure a more detailed assessment than traditional SES approaches while avoiding excessive items that could increase participant burden and compromise data quality. However, future studies should incorporate additional life stages to enable a more comprehensive analysis across the lifespan. Factors other than MSE, beyond the social domain, have cumulative effects on brain health48. Potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia may be influenced by disparities3. LA has one of the highest population-attributable fractions for dementia risk factors in the world27, associated with high levels of adversity, inequality5,12, and dementia prevalence12,13. Complex interactions between social exposome, genetics, physical exposome (pollution, pesticides, heavy metals)2,17, and modifiable risk factors are beyond the scope of this work and require additional research. Future studies should assess gene-environmental interactions. Like previous studies employing social determinants measures15,16, our data were measured at the individual level across countries. Our results do not comprise aggregate-level data. Future studies should incorporate nested designs with aggregated-level analyses and geocoded data relevant to brain health in LA, such as structural inequality14, air pollution2, and access to green spaces49. A further step in future research may involve adjusting individual metrics by nested analysis of spatial buffers at different scales (i.e., block [0–100 m], neighborhood [100–500 m], district/commune [500–5000 m], city [5–50 km]). Despite being unavailable in the current neuroscience literature, this would improve the ecological significance of the approach. Our study did not account for (ethnic or racial) discrimination and ancestry/genetic effects in a region with marked ethnic diversity16,17.

As other works in the region2,14,15, a limitation of this study is the reliance on clinical criteria for diagnosis without biomarkers like amyloid-β and tau, assessed via PET or plasma. PET is costly, globally inaccessible, and lacks validation in diverse populations such as LA50. Similarly, the feasibility and accuracy of blood-based biomarkers in LA have not yet been developed to validate their use combined with clinical criteria. Sample sizes are relatively modest within each country. ReDLat51 participants are derived from clinical samples and are not representative of the general population. However, the ReDLat cohort uses a well-distributed LA clinical sample that includes diverse populations51,52. While we acknowledge that LA is not a homogenous construct, this does not preclude the use of harmonized datasets across diverse countries2,7,14,15,20,53, as has been done in other large-scale initiatives such as ADNI and European cohorts, which also feature significant sociocultural differences. Future work should expand these findings by incorporating community-representative samples to enhance the generalizability of results. Although our recruitment was aligned with current guidelines54, many of the recommended strategies are designed with US research infrastructure in mind. They may not entirely apply to the general LA context, where limited resources and larger socioeconomic disparities often hinder research. Further, our protocol adheres to specific methodological considerations and recommended best practices for cross-national comparisons55: (a) The MSE questionnaire was developed and harmonized by a team of experts from various countries where it was subsequently applied, validated with a diverse sample of Latino Spanish-speaking participants56, and tested to represent the same construct across countries via psychometric validation. (b) The covariables included in structural equation model (SEM) analyses are available and collected under a harmonized protocol across all countries. (c) We used a pooled analysis approach, incorporating country-level effects in sensitivity analysis. Our study addresses underrepresented populations from LA, which present unique patterns of brain health2,7 compared to more homogenous populations (e.g., UK Biobank). The assessments of the dimensions related to social exposome are designed with different objectives and utilize distinct methodologies10. Future studies should develop more global and inclusive participation and evaluation globally. The functional ability and neuropsychiatric measures were not sensitive to healthy aging, likely due to a disease-sensitive floor effect of these measures (i.e., healthy controls present floor effects with no impairments). Future studies should consider other assessments tailored to healthy aging. Lastly, our neuroimaging analyses encompassed different scanners and recording parameters. However, sensitivity analyses confirmed that inter-scanner differences and data quality metrics did not compromise the results.

In conclusion, this study evidenced an association of the multidimensional social exposome on brain health outcomes in aging and dementia across LA underserved populations. These results call for the development of tailored models incorporating the impact of social environments in characterizing dementia. Prevention initiatives and multicomponent interventions targeting structural inequality should consider lifespan cumulative effects to foster healthier aging trajectories and improve brain health in LA.

The study included 2211 participants with a mean age of 64.63 years (SD = 11.26), of whom 67.03% were women. Sex information was determined by self-report. The sample was comprised of individuals with probable AD (n = 781), FTLD (n = 255), and HC (n = 1175) (Table 1). Participants were recruited from the Multi-Partner Consortium to Expand Dementia Research in Latin America (ReDLat)51,57, with recruitment conducted across six LA countries: Argentina (n = 112, HC:AD/FTLD = 52:60), Brazil (n = 172, HC:AD/FTLD = 116:56), Chile (n = 200, HC:AD/FTLD = 78:122), Colombia (n = 730, HC:AD/FTLD = 250:480), Mexico (n = 356, HC:AD/FTLD = 227:129), Peru (n = 641, HC:AD/FTLD = 452:189). ReDLat collects data from multiple centers across these countries, using a standardized data framework and harmonized diagnostic protocols7,20,53,58,59. Participants were recruited from extensive networks including (a) clinical networks, involving memory clinics, neurology departments, and affiliated hospitals; (b) academic collaborations, leveraging partnerships with universities and research institutions; (c) community outreach programs, engaging with local communities through informational sessions, and culturally tailored materials to encourage participation from rural and urban populations with diverse socioeconomic backgrounds; and (d) public health initiatives and local organizations, integrating recruitment efforts with public health campaigns and community groups to raise awareness and facilitate participation. These efforts allowed us to include individuals from rural and urban settings, focusing on underrepresented groups, as our ReDLat cohort is marked by socioeconomic inequality14 and educational disparities15. Strategies to improve access and recruitment for these groups involve field screenings, community engagement efforts, and the use of mobile units. No compensation was provided to participants. Exclusion criteria included participants with conditions other than AD or FTLD or those with impairments preventing task completion. Diagnoses were determined by consensus among expert healthcare providers at each site, based on cognitive and neurological exams, clinical interviews, and MRI57. The diagnoses are based on the clinical criteria established by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) for AD, as well as on the clinical criteria specified for FTLD. Healthy Controls had preserved cognition and no history of neurological or psychiatric conditions. A standardized battery was used to capture clinician evaluations. Clinical and cognitive assessments across ReDLat sites were harmonized, normalized, and validated57. ReDLat aligns with current guidelines to increase the representativeness of samples enrolled in Alzheimer's disease research centers54 by implementing inclusive recruitment strategies and strengthened community engagement, geographic decentralization, and unified inclusion and exclusion criteria. All clinicians underwent training and certification by a specialized team and adhered to a quality control protocol57. The study received approval from the ReDLat consortium through multiple institutional review boards: FWA00028264, FWA00001035, FWA00028864, FWA00001113, FWA00010121, FWA00014416, FWA00008475, FWA00029236, FWA00029089, and FWA00000068. Data collection and analysis presented no risks related to stigmatization, incrimination, discrimination, animal welfare, environmental or health concerns, safety, security or personal privacy. Additionally, no transfer of biological materials, cultural artifacts or traditional knowledge occurred. All participants signed informed consent in accordance with the 2013 Declaration of Helsinki.

An expert team designed a questionnaire that reviewed existing tools and their validity data on various social, economic, familial, and environmental factors that can influence health across the lifespan56. This questionnaire was created by different experts working with Latino participants from Mexico, Central America, and South America. It was co-designed by the ReDLat consortium and the UCSF-MAC, following the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework and the Institute of Medicine reports. Matching guidelines to increase sample representativeness in Alzheimer's disease research54 and recommended practices for cross-national comparisons55, validity testing was performed with a diverse sample of Latino Spanish-speaking participants, clinicians, and researchers to iteratively improve the questionnaire and standardize the collection of sociodemographic factors. Unlike typical questionnaires that focus on single domains, such as education, childhood experiences, or traumatic experiences, this questionnaire aimed to evaluate multiple domains simultaneously to understand how life experiences and conditions from childhood to the present impact health. The questionnaire builds on existing tools like the Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patient Assets, Risk, and Experiences (PRAPARE) and the Latin American and Caribbean Food Security Scale (ELCSA). Questionnaire construction aligns with current harmonization guidelines60, as (a) items were selected after careful inspection from clinicians and researchers from different cultures (at least one from each country) and comparability across countries; (b) development of psychometric procedures to test if dimension composite score represents a coherent and consistent latent construct of interrelated variables and captures the intended dimension; and (c) transparency and openness by providing the full version of the questionnaire in a repository (https://osf.io/78ng6/).

The protocol has been standardized, validated, and subjected to psychometric standardization samples from different countries, including healthy individuals and those with neurocognitive disorders, ensuring its applicability to diverse populations56,61. The questionnaire was administered to 137 participant-caregiver dyads in a more detailed validation. After multivariate assumptions such as normality, linearity, homogeneity, and homoscedasticity, adequacy tests were conducted to ensure data quality (Bartlett's test of sphericity: χ2 = 2191.611, p < 0.001; Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure: MSA = 0.75). Lastly, a three-factor SEM was created, including SES, challenging life experiences, and educational environment, which showed good fit indices (TLI = 0.764, RMSEA = 0.062, SRMR = 0.06, CFI = 0.884)56. We reviewed the questionnaire to remove items that might create circular associations with dementia-related outcomes. We excluded dimensions that could be directly influenced by dementia symptoms, thereby risking the measurement of those symptoms instead of the intended MSE construct. Specifically, we removed items related to technology access (smartphone use), employment status (work engagement), and income sources (current salary) (Supplementary Information 5).

The MSE questionnaire systematically evaluates a comprehensive range of topics to ensure a thorough assessment of the participant's background and experiences.

Education is evaluated through the number of years of formal education, the type of school attended (public or private), the geographical location of the school (rural or urban), and the overall quality of education received (from very bad to excellent), number of books at home during the first 10 years of life (from 0 to more than 200), and the educational achievement of the mother and father (from none to doctoral degree).

Food insecurity captures if the participant had to eat less (yes/no) or less healthy (yes/no) due to economic hardship across the lifespan (from 0 to 10, 35 to 45 years old, and recently), capturing the quality and consistency of food insecurity experienced by the participant across the lifespan.

Financial status assesses the participant's financial stability and ability to meet basic needs over different periods of their life (from 0 to 10, 35 to 45 years old, and recently). It measures the difficulty in covering basic needs, the sufficiency of income at the end of the month, the diversity of income sources, and the proportion of income spent on housing. Additionally, it gauges the participant's financial resilience in the event of lost income and health insurance (public, private, or none), offering a comprehensive view of their economic situation and security throughout their lifespan.

Assets evaluate the participant's access to essential household utilities and goods over different periods (from 0 to 10, 35 to 45 years old, and recently). It assesses whether the participant had access to electricity, radio, television, refrigerator, washing machine, landline telephone, water heater, indoor bathroom, running water, automobile, computer, internet, sound system, smartphone, and private room. Additionally, it measures the quantity of certain items like televisions, bathrooms, cars, computers, and private rooms the participant had during these periods. This assessment provides a detailed view of the participant's material living conditions and how they have evolved throughout their lifespan.

Access to healthcare assesses the participant's difficulty in affording medical care across different life stages (from 0 to 10, 35 to 45 years old, and recently). It evaluates whether the participant experienced difficulty paying for medical services and explores specific barriers that may have prevented them from seeing a doctor (from not hard to very hard). These barriers include financial constraints, appointment availability, transportation issues, distance, lack of accompaniment, the COVID-19 pandemic, or socio-political events (yes/no). This assessment provides insights into the participant's access to healthcare and the factors influencing it throughout their lifespan.

Childhood labor investigates whether the participant worked before the age of 18 (yes/no) and the specific age range during which they started working (from 5 to 18 years old). It also delves into the reasons for working at a young age, including whether to meet personal needs, support family needs, save money, or learn a new skill (yes/no). This assessment provides insight into the participants' early exposure to work and the SES factors that may have influenced their decision to work during childhood or adolescence.

Subjective SES is evaluated by asking participants to reflect on their family's ability to meet basic needs and their financial situation from 0 to 10, 35 to 45 years old, and recently (from level 0 to 10).

Childhood experiences comprise the participant's early childhood environment, focusing on family structure, emotional support, and potential adverse experiences. It includes questions about the number of children in the household during the first 10 years, whether the participant had to leave school to support the household (yes/no), and the frequency of feeling loved by parents and receiving physical affection. Additionally, it explores conflicts within the family, such as fights between parents, parents-participant, and siblings. The questions also inquire about exposure to alcohol abuse, the organization of the household, and experiences of neglect during childhood (from never to frequently). This assessment provides a comprehensive view of the participant's early family life and its potential impact on their development.

Traumatic events evaluate the participant's exposure to traumatic events, violence, and maltreatment from 0 to 10, 11 to 24, 25 to 34, 35 to 45, 46 to 65 years old, less than a year, and recently. It includes questions about the loss of siblings or children before the age of 18, experiences of political violence and repression, and exposure to theft or robbery both inside and outside the home. It also examines the participants' involvement in or witness to accidents, situations where they feared for their lives, and encounters with dead or injured individuals. Furthermore, the questions explore experiences of physical violence, being attacked with a weapon, humiliation, restrictions on personal freedom, neglect, and financial control. Additionally, the set assesses instances where the participant was pressured to leave their property or coerced into sexual activity (yes/no). These experiences are considered in relation to different individuals (family members, friends, caregivers, strangers) (yes/no). This comprehensive assessment aims to capture the depth and breadth of the participant's exposure to adverse and potentially traumatic experiences throughout their life.

Relationships assess the participant's frequency of contact with loved ones and experiences of being treated with less respect across different stages of life and in recent times. It measures how often the participant interacts with close family or friends, ranging from less than once a week to more than five times a week. Additionally, it explores the frequency of disrespect or mistreatment experienced during various life stages (0 to 10, 11 to 24, 25 to 34, 35 to 45, 46 to 65 years old, less than a year, and recently). These experiences are categorized by how often they occur, ranging from almost daily to less than once a year or never. This assessment provides insights into the participant's social connections and the prevalence of negative interpersonal experiences throughout their life.

The questionnaire employs various response formats, including Likert scales, multiple-choice questions (Yes/No), and free text fields. Privacy is prioritized, with the most sensitive questions, such as those about experiences of violence, abuse, and discrimination, answered individually by the participant (without the presence of the caregiver). Following previous reports62, we scored the questionnaire by creating composite variables by grouping items based on expert consensus on the similarity of the assessed domains. After excluding items (Supplementary Information 5), each variable was min–max scaled between 0 and 1, with 0 and 1 indicating lower and higher levels of adversity of social exposome. Then, the dimension scores for each participant were obtained by averaging the value of the total number of variables per category (education, food insecurity, financial status, assets, access to healthcare, childhood labor, subjective SES, childhood experiences, traumatic events, and relations) to produce a score between 0 and 1. These values for each domain were used as inputs in the SEM. Confirmatory factor analyses showed a good model fit for the dimensions (Supplementary Table 13). These results indicate that the dimension composite scores accurately represent the latent construct and consistently capture the intended dimensions.

The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) is a widely used cognitive screening tool that evaluates various cognitive functions, including arithmetic, memory, and orientation. It assesses five key domains: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. The MMSE is scored from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. A score of 24 or above is considered normal, while scores below 24 suggest cognitive impairment. Specifically, scores between 19 and 23 indicate mild cognitive impairment, scores between 10 and 18 indicate moderate cognitive impairment, and scores below 10 suggest severe cognitive impairment. The MMSE has demonstrated moderate to high reliability and is frequently used across LA populations.

The Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire (PFAQ) is a tool designed to assess the functional ability of older adults, focusing on instrumental activities of daily living. The PFAQ evaluates the capacity to perform activities such as using the telephone, managing finances, preparing meals, and managing medications. Scoring of the PFAQ ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater levels of dependence or functional impairment. Each item is rated on a scale from 0 (independent) to 3 (dependent), and the total score provides an overview of the individual's functional status. The PFAQ is reliable and employed in studies involving LA populations.

The Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) is a streamlined version of the original Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), designed to assess a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms commonly found in patients with dementia. The NPI-Q evaluates 12 key domains: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, euphoria/elation, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behavior, nighttime behavioral disturbances, and appetite/eating abnormalities. Scoring of the NPI-Q ranges from 0 to 36, with two components for each domain: the frequency and severity of symptoms. Frequency is rated from 1 (occasionally) to 4 (very frequently), and severity is rated from 1 (mild) to 3 (severe). The total score sums these ratings across all domains, providing a comprehensive measure of the patient's neuropsychiatric profile. Higher scores indicate more severe and frequent symptoms. The NPI-Q has adequate test-retest reliability and convergent validity and is commonly applied in research involving LA populations.

Scores of functional ability and neuropsychiatric symptoms were inverted to facilitate the interpretability of the associations in the same direction as cognitive scores. The higher the value, the higher the functional capacity and the lower the neuropsychiatric symptoms.

3D T1-weighted images were collected for 875 individuals with a mean age of 65.13 years (SD = 10.77), of whom 65.94% were women. Sex information was determined by self-report. 310 individuals with AD, 123 with FTLD, and 442 HC were included (Argentina [n = 84, HC:AD/FTLD = 38:46], Brazil [n = 92, HC:AD/FTLD = 69:23], Chile [n = 137, HC:AD/FTLD = 53:84], Colombia [n = 203, HC:AD/FTLD = 25:178], Mexico [n = 53, HC:AD/FTLD = 29:24], Peru [n = 306, HC:AD/FTLD = 228:78], Supplementary Table 14). Preprocessing and analysis were employed using VBM with the Computational Anatomy (CAT12) toolbox and in Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM 12; Wellcome Center for Human Neuroimaging; www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/) in Matlab R2021a. The standard pipeline included bias-field correction, noise reduction, skull stripping, segmentation, and normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space at a 1.5 mm isotropic resolution. CAT12 also performed intra-subject harmonization by normalizing data to the mean global intensity for each subject, followed by smoothing gray matter images with a 6 × 6 × 6 mm Gaussian kernel. The homogeneity and orthogonality of the images were verified. Scanner effects were controlled through two approaches: by including scanner type as a covariate in the VBM regression models and standardizing between the minimum and maximum intensity values of each voxel for all subjects evaluated by each scanner type2.

Resting-state sequences were collected for 500 individuals with a mean age of 65.27 years (SD = 12.02), of whom 61.80% were women. Sex information was determined by self-report. 232 individuals with AD, 85 with FTLD, and 183 HC were included (Argentina [n = 51, HC:AD/FTLD = 27:24], Brazil [n = 86, HC:AD/FTLD = 65:21], Chile [n = 127, HC:AD/FTLD = 47:80], Colombia [n = 202, HC:AD/FTLD = 24:178], Mexico [n = 34, HC:AD/FTLD = 20:14], Supplementary Table 15). Image preprocessing was employed using the fmriprep (version 22.0.2) standard pipeline, encompassing head motion artifacts, slice timing, susceptibility distortion correction, co-registration to the anatomical image, and normalization to standard space, with additional steps in the CONN22.a toolbox63. This involved smoothing with a 6 × 6 × 6 mm Gaussian kernel and denoising through linear regression with nine nuisance regressors applied in a single step: six motion parameters (translation and rotation), white matter, cerebrospinal fluid signals, and scrubbing regressors for high-motion time points, and applying a band-pass filter (0.008-0.09 Hz. A motion correction technique was applied by rigidly aligning fMRI volumes to T1-weighted images, ensuring that the impact of motion artifacts was minimized. Motion scrubbing was then applied using framewise displacement >0.2 mm and temporal derivative variance across apace> 5%, which are stricter than conventional thresholds, to flag and remove high-motion frames. The mean proportion of artifact-free to rejected frames was 0.915 (SD = 0.126), with values ranging from 30% to 100%. This was implemented using the artifact detection tools within the CONN toolbox63, using a conservative setting (FD = 0.2 mm, global signal Z = 5) to remove motion artifacts while preserving the biological signal. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between the average BOLD time series of each pair of regions of interest (ROIs) from the Brainnetome atlas, a structural and functional connectivity-based parcellation atlas that captures both cortical and subcortical regions, better suited to functional connectivity analysis. AAL atlas cerebellar regions were added, generating a total of 272 × 272 ROIs correlation matrix for each participant. These correlation matrices were Fisher z-transformed to normalize the distribution of the correlation coefficients. Scanner variability was controlled by including scanner type as a covariate in the ROI-to-ROI connectivity regression models.

SEM is a statistical method that facilitates the examination of relationships among observed and latent variables, particularly useful for measuring the effect of each indicator and its cumulative effect through a latent variable by integrating aspects of regression analysis, factor analysis, and simultaneous equation models64. The model's structure was based on ten composite variables derived from the MSE questionnaire, which included education, food insecurity, financial status, assets, access to healthcare (randomly set as the fixed indicator to identify the values for the latent factor), childhood labor, subjective SES, childhood experiences, traumatic events, and relationships. These variables served as indicators of a single MSE latent variable, which was used to predict cognition, functional ability, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The functional ability and neuropsychiatric symptoms scores were inverted to align their interpretation with other measures. Covariances between variables were theoretically guided by the top modification index score. Model fit was assessed using the fit indices comparative fit index (CFI ≥ 0.9), Tucker–Lewis index (TLI ≥ 0.9), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA ≤ 0.08), and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR ≤ 0.08). We did not consider χ2 based on its high sensitivity to sample size; as the sample size increases, χ2 values rise, resulting in lower p-values, thus skewing the interpretation of the model's fit.

Separate models were run for each group to examine the specific associations with cognition, functional ability, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. In addition to testing group-specific effects, this approach allows us to isolate the effects within each group. This approach abolishes the confounding factors observed in group comparisons due to age and sex differences. The value of the MSE latent variable for each subject was extracted from these models for subsequent analysis of associations with gray matter and resting-state functional connectivity. Even the smallest sample size (FTLD) met the N ratio of 10:1 for statistical accuracy and power, with 225 participants exceeding the number of estimated parameters (q = 13). Missing data (maximum 19.7%) were imputed across the sample using predictive mean matching through the multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) package (3.16.0) in R version 4.3.0. Additional sensitivity analyses were performed to check for bias due to imputation. The main SEM models were run without imputation for the entire sample and each group separately. Results showed consistent associations across all models, indicating that imputation did not introduce bias. (Supplementary Table 16)

Lasso regression was employed to examine the individual contributions of MSE dimensions while controlling for multicollinearity. This method was chosen for its ability to perform variable selection and regularization, shrinking less relevant coefficients toward zero and effectively excluding them from the model. The standardized beta coefficients from the SEM models linking the global MSE score to cognition, functionality, and neuropsychiatric symptoms were compared to the R2 values from the Lasso models that included individual MSE dimensions via meta-regressions. This comparison assessed the global MSE score's explanatory power versus individual dimensions, highlighting the benefits of using an aggregate social exposure metric for understanding multidimensional outcomes.

Bootstrap resampling (n = 400) was applied to estimate the standardized beta coefficients for the paths from the MSE factor to each outcome, capturing the effect sizes and their variability across the bootstrap samples. In parallel, Lasso regression was applied to each bootstrap sample to identify the model's predictive performance using R2, also capturing effect size variability across the bootstrap samples. After obtaining the bootstrap estimates for both SEM and Lasso regression, the results were compared via meta-regressions for each group across outcomes.

We conducted regression analyses using parametric tests to examine the associations between MSE and brain volume in SPM12, with age, sex, total intracranial volume (TIV), and scanner effects (see Supplementary Table 17 for acquisition parameters) included as covariates of no interest. To enhance behavioral variance and statistical power, HC were merged with AD patients to run VBM models for the AD group, and the process was repeated by pairing HC with FTLD patients for the FTLD model. Multiple comparisons were corrected using the TFCE method, applied via the TFCE toolbox (http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/tfce). This method integrates voxel and cluster thresholds, eliminating the need for arbitrary cluster formation thresholds and enhancing sensitivity to both focal and diffuse effects, thus optimizing the balance between the FDR and replicability65. Statistical significance was assessed through 5000 permutations and set at PFDR < 0.05. Extent and height cluster parameters were set to 0.5 and 2, respectively, following standard approaches66. Brain imaging results were visualized using MRIcroGL (v1.2.20220720).

We conducted regression analyses via parametric tests with the MSE score as a predictor of the whole-brain ROI-to-ROI connectivity. The number of connections of each ROI was calculated to assess its contribution to the broader connectivity patterns associated with MSE. Following alternate methods of calculating degree centrality67,68, we considered edges that were positively or negatively weighted and statistically significant (FDR-corrected). These correspond to values different from zero in the t-statistic matrix, reflecting meaningful ROI-to-ROI relationships. These edges were binarized—assigned a value of one—so that each significant, weighted edge contributes a count of 1 to a node's degree centrality, representing the number of connections each ROI exhibits in relation to MSE. Higher values indicate that a given ROI's connectivity demonstrates more widespread associations with MSE. As for gray matter associations, age, sex, and scanner effect (see Supplementary Table 18 for acquisition parameters) were included as covariates of no interest, and each patient group was analyzed in tandem with HC. All results were PFDR corrected at the connection level for the size of the ROI-to-ROI matrix for each ROI, as implemented in CONN toolbox63. Visualization was performed using BrainNet Viewer.

To control for the effect of confounding variables, we ran a separate SEM model for the entire sample that included age and sex as predictors of the latent MSE factor, as well as cognition, functional ability, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. To control for disease-related variables, we ran a model with AD and FTLD participants that included disease severity (Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) total score and CDR-FTLD scale-modified), age at onset, and years since diagnosis, in addition to age and sex as predictors of MSE, as well as cognition, functional ability, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Additionally, to examine the potential effect of the FTLD subtype, we implemented a model with FTLD participants, including a binary subtype variable (behavioral variant frontotemporal lobar degeneration vs. any other subtype) as a predictor of MSE, as well as cognition, functional ability, and neuropsychiatric symptoms.

To investigate whether MSE was influenced by data quality of structural and functional MRI, we conducted sensitivity analyses examining the relationships between MSE and spatial signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for both MRI and fMRI, temporal SNR for fMRI, and head motion parameters for fMRI. To evaluate the quality of MRI and fMRI data, we employed the ODQ metric69. For MRI data, the assessment focused on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across each slice. The SNR was determined by calculating the mean signal of brain voxels and dividing it by the standard deviation of the signal. For fMRI data, the quality evaluation involved segmenting each time series into 20 repetition times (TR) intervals to compute the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR)70. The tSNR was defined as the mean fMRI signal within each segment divided by its standard deviation. To further test the effect of motion correction, we applied two procedures: rigid realignment of fMRI volumes to T1-weighted images and scrubbing of high-motion frames. Scrubbing was based on framewise displacement >0.2 mm and global signal change >5% (Methods, Neuroimaging Acquisition and Preprocessing). Participants with less than 70% of artifact-free frames were excluded (Supplementary Tables 7-8). Scanner scaling approaches were applied to MRI data to reduce inter-scanner variability2 (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). The minimum and maximum voxel intensity values were extracted from all subjects belonging to each scanner type, which were then scaled between the minimum and maximum intensity values specific to each scanner type. Then, voxel-based morphometry analyses were replicated with the scaled images. This method accounts for differences in location and scale (e.g., mean and variance) between sites, reducing scanner-related variability. This process helps to minimize the variability introduced by different scanners2,20.

Accurate projections of evapotranspiration (ET) are crucial for understanding hydrological responses to climate warming, which remain highly uncertain because of complex land–atmosphere interactions. Here we develop a theoretical framework to disentangle these interactions, achieving highly consistent ET projections between offline and coupled models. Our findings show that previous estimates of climate-driven ET increases have been exaggerated, primarily due to a substantial overestimation of atmospheric evaporative demand. Notably, the atmospheric conditions often assumed to drive ET are, in fact, responses to ET changes induced by soil moisture and vegetation dynamics. Neglecting these land–atmosphere feedbacks has led to a 25–39% overestimation of climate-driven global ET increases and a 77–121% exaggeration of the negative contribution from land surface changes. These biases have caused large discrepancies in hydrological projections and attributions between offline and coupled models, underscoring the importance of accurately representing land–atmosphere interactions to improve the reliability and consistency of future hydrological projections.

a, ET is constrained by the net radiation (\({R}_{n}\)) and surface moisture availability over a dry surface. b, PETa is constrained by aerodynamic conditions, assuming unlimited water and energy supply. The dry surface in a is hypothetically converted to a wet surface but remains decoupled from the atmosphere, meaning that surface temperature (\({T}_{s}\)), air temperature (\({T}_{a}\)), and vapor pressure (\({e}_{a}\)) remain unchanged from the dry surface. The only change is that the vapor pressure at the evaporative surface becomes saturated (\({e}_{s}^{* }\) replaces unsaturated \({e}_{s}\)). Consequently, sensible heat (\(H\)) over the hypothetical wet surface remains unchanged compared to the dry surface, but the latent heat (\(\lambda {PE}{T}_{a}\)) is much larger than \(\lambda {ET}\). c, PETe is constrained by the net radiation (\({R}_{n}\)), when the entire dry surface becomes saturated and fully coupled with the atmosphere. Both surface and atmospheric conditions cool down (\({T}_{s}^{{\prime} }\) and \({T}_{a}^{{\prime} }\)) and become more humid (\({e}_{s}^{* {\prime} }\) and \({e}_{a}^{{\prime} }\)) relative to the dry environment. As a result, the latent heat (\(\lambda {PE}{T}_{e}\)) increases, while the sensible heat (\({H}_{w}\)) decreases, all constrained by \({R}_{n}\).

a, Illustration of the difference in \({\beta }_{w}\) when an ocean grid cell were artificially dried up completely. The grey curve shows the saturation vapor pressure (\({e}^{* }/\gamma\)) as a function of temperature (\(T\)), while the two dashed lines represent air and surface isenthapic processes with constant enthalpy, \(T+e/\gamma\), from wet to the driest conditions. Temperature and vapor pressure for the air and surface are shown in blue for the wet state, pink for the dry state, and purple for the driest state. b, Illustration of changes in \({\beta }_{w}\) when surface and air temperatures change proportionally from wet to the driest conditions for the ocean grid cell. The x-axis refers to the mean surface and air temperature. The blue line shows \({\beta }_{{pt}}\) inferred from the Priestley-Taylor equation (PETpt) for the same ocean grid cell. c-d, Frequency distribution of the sensitivities of \({\beta }_{w}\) and \({\beta }_{{pt}}\) to mean temperature, that is, the ratio of the differences in \({\beta }_{w}\) and \({\beta }_{{pt}}\) over the difference in mean temperature (\(d{\beta }_{w}/{dT}\) and \(d{\beta }_{{pt}}/{dT}\)) between wet and the driest conditions, for ocean grid cells in 2020 and 2100, based on 32 CMIP6 models. Mean sensitivities of \({\beta }_{w}\) and \({\beta }_{{pt}}\) across all grid cells are shown in parentheses.

a,b, Frequency distribution of the relative changes in PETe (\(\Delta\)PETe/PETe, a) and PETa (\(\Delta\)PETa/PETa, b) from wet to the driest conditions in 2020 and 2100, based on 32 CMIP6 models. PETe and PETa under wet conditions are derived from ocean grid cells, while their values under the driest conditions are estimated based on the constraint of moist enthalpy (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 2). Mean relative changes across all grid cells and models are shown in each panel. c,d, Frequency distribution of the relative changes in PETe (\(\Delta\)PETe/PETe, c) and PETa (\(\Delta\)PETa/PETa, d) induced by the vegetation physiological responses to elevated CO2 across land grid cells, based on 7 ESMs. In each ESM, relative changes are computed as the ratio of the mean difference between 1pctCO2 and 1pctCO2-rad to the value in 1pctCO2-rad, averaged over the final 30-year period of their 140-year simulations (1960–1989).

a-c, Multi-model mean PETe from 1pctCO2 and 1pctCO2-rad and their differences (\(\Delta\)PETe) induced by vegetation physiological responses to elevated CO2 during the final 30 years of the 140-year simulations (1960–1989). d-f, The same as a-c, but for PETa. Basemap in a-f is from Natural Earth56.

a, Relationship between the dryness index (PET/P) and the ET ratio (ET/P), using PET from the energy balance (PETe), the Priestley-Taylor (PETpt), the open-water Penman (PETow), the reference crop Penman-Monteith (PETrc), and the energy-only (PETeo) equations. The circles show global terrestrial mean values from 1850 to 1989 (140 years) averaged over the 7 models in 1pctCO2-rad. b, Distribution of the correlation coefficient (r) between global terrestrial mean PET/P and ET/P over the 140 years across the 7 models. The top and bottom of each box represent the first and third quartiles, the center line the median, the whiskers the data range (excluding outliers, shown as circles), and the cross the mean values across the 7 models. c, Changes in the dryness index (PET/P) and the ET ratio over land relative to the first 30-year period during the 140-year simulations (1850-1989). d, Changes in the global mean ET (\(\Delta\)ET) projected by the 7 models and estimated using the Budyko framework with 30-year mean precipitation and PETe (\(\Delta\)ET_PETe), the three Penman equations (\(\Delta\)ET_PETpt, \(\Delta\)ET_PETow, and \(\Delta\)ET_PETrc), and the energy-only equation (\(\Delta\)ET_PETeo). The first year of each 30-year period (111 moving averages in total) is shown along the horizontal axis. The solid lines show 7-model means and the shading refers to one standard deviation across the 7 models in c and d.

a, Relationship between the dryness index (PETLAC/P) and the ET ratio (ET/P) with climate change. The circles represent global terrestrial mean values from 1850 to 1989, averaged across 7 models in 1pctCO2-rad. b, Global pattern of the 7-model mean correlation coefficient (r) between annual ET/P and annual PETLAC/P in 1pctCO2-rad. c, Global pattern of the difference in ET changes projected directly from the 7 models (\(\Delta\)ET) and indirectly using the Budyko framework with PETLAC and precipitation (\(\Delta\)ET_Budyko). The 7-model mean \(\Delta\)ET is computed between the first (1850-1879) and final (1960-1989) 30-year periods of 1pctCO2-rad. d, Climate-driven changes in the global mean \(\Delta\)ET projected by the 7 models and estimated using the Budyko framework (\(\Delta\)ET_Budyko) over the 140-year simulation of 1pctCO2-rad. e, Changes in the global mean \(\Delta\)ET projected by the 7 models in 1pctCO2 and the isolated contributions of climate change (\(\Delta\)ETcc, 1pctCO2-rad) and land surface changes (\(\Delta\)ETlsc, 1pctCO2 – 1pctCO2-rad). The climate change effect (\(\Delta\)ETcc_Budyko) and land surface effect (\(\Delta\)ETlsc_Budyko) estimated using the Budyko framework are also shown. The first year of each 30-year period (111 moving averages in total) is shown along the horizontal axis. The solid lines represent the 7-model means and the shading refers to one standard deviation across the 7 models in d and e. Basemap in b and c made with Natural Earth56.

a-c, Multi-model mean differences between the energy-based PETe and ET during the historical period (1980-2009), the future period (2071-2100), and their changes (future minus historical). d-f, The same as a-c, but for the differences between the PET based on land atmosphere coupling (PETLAC) and ET. Grid cells where the absolute difference between PET and ET is less than 0.05 mm/day are shown in grey. Each panel reports the mean and one standard deviation of the PET-ET difference (bias) across all ocean grid cells. Basemap in a-f made with Natural Earth56.

Phenazines are highly prevalent, natural bioactive substances secreted by microbes. However, their mode of action and potential involvement in shaping microbiomes remain elusive. Here we performed a comprehensive analysis of over 1.35 million bacterial genomes to identify phenazine-producing bacteria distributed across 193 species in 34 families. Analysis of rhizosphere microbiome and public rhizosphere metagenomic datasets revealed that phenazines could shape the microbial community by inhibiting Gram-positive bacteria, which was verified by pairwise interaction assays using Phenazine-1-carboxamide (PCN)-producing Pseudomonas chlororaphis. PCN induced DNA damage in Bacillus subtilis, a model Gram-positive target, where it directly bound to the bacterial topoisomerase IV, inhibiting its decatenation activity and leading to cell death. A two-species consortium of phenazine-producing Pseudomonas and resistant B. subtilis exhibited superior synergistic activity in preventing Fusarium crown rot in wheat plants. This work advances our understanding of a prevalent microbial interaction and its potential for biocontrol.

a, Schematic representation of the Identifier of Phenazine-Producing Bacteria (IPPB) pipeline. The pipeline automates the search for homologous proteins of phenazine biosynthetic core proteins (PhzA/B, PhzC, PhzD, PhzE, PhzF, PhzG) within a strain's genome. Protein identity thresholds are applied as indicated, and strains are classified as phz+ if all core proteins are identified and the corresponding genes are located within 20 kb of each other. Strains meeting these criteria are classified as phz+ bacterium, and included in the phylogenetic tree. Abbreviations: NGDC, National Geoscience Data Centre; IMG/M, Integrated Microbial Genomes & Microbiomes system. b, Schematic representation of 23 reference phenazine biosynthetic gene clusters. Core biosynthetic genes (phzA/B, phzC, phzD, phzE, phzF, phzG) are shown in color, while adjacent, non-core genes are depicted in grey.

a, Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of the phz+ bacterial genera based full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences. Phylum-level classifications are indicated.

Soil samples were collected on days 3 and 7 after irrigation with ZJU60 and ΔphzA–H in wheat field microcosms. 16S rRNA gene fragment amplicon sequencing revealed distinct temporal changes in the composition and structure of the rhizosphere microbiomes. Data are presented as means ± s.d. of n = 5 biological replicates. For graphs shown in a, b and d, letters that are different from one another indicate that their means are statistically different using a two-sided ANOVA and Tukey's HSD (P < 0.05).

a, Correlation analysis between the relative abundances (RA) of phz+ bacteria and Pseudomonas in rhizosphere microbiomes. b-d, Pairwise Spearman correlation between the abundance of the three most prevalent bacterial taxa at each taxonomic level and the abundance of phz+ Pseudomonas. The relative abundances of the analyzed taxa were obtained from shotgun-sequenced metagenome datasets and subsequently log-transformed. The Spearman correlation coefficient (R) and corresponding P value was calculated using the ggscatter function from the ggpubr package in R. The grey shaded area indicates the 95% confidence interval of the regression line, shown in blue.

Metatranscriptomic datasets were used to determine both gene expression and the relative abundances of the target taxa. The Spearman correlation coefficient (R) and corresponding P value (P < 0.05) were calculated using the ggscatter function from the ggpubr package in R. The grey shaded area indicates the 95% confidence interval of the regression line, shown in blue.

The antimicrobial activity of ZJU60 was assessed on LBGM agar medium against 70 bacterial species. One representative strain from each species was selected for testing. ZJU60 was inoculated on the top of a lawn of the individual test strains, and inhibition zones were indicated by dashed circles after 72 h of incubation. Scale bar = 5 mm. Detailed information on the tested strains can be found in Supplementary Table 1.

Data and images from NASA's Mars Perseverance rover reveals that recently discovered rocks in Jezero crater are organic carbon bearing mudstones. The findings, detailed in a paper published in Nature, indicate that these mudstones experienced chemical processes that left behind colorful, enigmatic textures in the rock that represent potential biosignatures.

The paper, led by Joel Hurowitz, PhD, Associate Professor in the Department of Geosciences at Stony Brook University, builds upon ongoing research conducted with the rover since it landed in 2021 – work aimed at characterizing early Martian geological processes and collecting samples that may someday be returned to Earth.

Upon entering the Jezero crater's western edge, Perseverance investigated distinctive mudstone outcrops of the Bright Angel formation. There, the Mars 2020 science team conducted a detailed geological, petrographic, and geochemical survey of these rocks and found traces of carbon matter along with minerals, namely ferrous iron phosphate and iron sulfide.

While the research team is not claiming to have found some form of fossilized life on Mars, they do believe the rocks contain features that could have been formed by life – a potential biosignature. A potential biosignature is any characteristic, element, molecule, substance, or feature that could have been formed by past biological life, but which also could have formed in the absence of life. While a compelling find, the team points out that more data is needed before any conclusion can be made about whether microbial activity is responsible for the development of the features observed in the mudstones.

“These mudstones provide information about Mars' surface environmental conditions at a time hundreds of millions of years after the planet formed, and thus they can be seen as a great record of the planetary environment and habitability during that period,” says Hurowitz, who has been involved with Mars rover research since he was a graduate student at Stony Brook University in 2004.

“We will need to conduct broader research into both living and non-living processes that will help us to better understand the conditions under which the collection of minerals and organic phases in the Bright Angel formation were formed,” he explains.

More specifically, the researchers concluded the following during their analyses:

Continued research will be done to assess the rocks and mudstone features. For the time being, the researchers ultimately conclude that analysis of the core sample collected from this unit using high-sensitivity instrumentation on Earth will enable the measurements required to determine the origin of the minerals, organics, and textures it contains.”

A team of Canadian scientists has discovered a surprising new way to improve blood sugar levels and reduce liver damage: by trapping a little-known fuel made by gut bacteria before they wreak havoc on the body.

The findings, published in Cell Metabolism on July 29, 2025, could open the door to new therapies to treat metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease.

Researchers at McMaster University, Université Laval and the University of Ottawa showed that a molecule produced by microbes in the gut can sneak into the bloodstream and fuel the liver to make more glucose and fat than necessary. But when researchers developed a way to trap this molecule in the gut before it enters the body, they saw dramatic improvements in blood sugar control and fatty liver disease in mice with obesity.

"This is a new twist on a classic metabolic pathway," says Jonathan Schertzer, senior and corresponding author and professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster. "We've known for nearly a century that muscles and the liver exchange lactate and glucose -- a process called the Cori cycle. What we've discovered is a new branch of that cycle, where gut bacteria are also part of the conversation."

In 1947, married scientists Carl Ferdinand Cori and Gerty Theresa Cori were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work showing how muscles in the body generate lactate that fuels the liver to produce blood glucose, which then cycles back to fuel the muscle. The work laid the foundation to explain how muscles use a form of lactate (L-lactate), and the liver uses blood glucose, to communicate and exchange fuel with each other.

The Canadian team found that obese mice -- and even people with obesity -- have higher levels of a lesser-known molecule, D-lactate, in their blood. Unlike the more familiar L-lactate made by muscles, most of the D-lactate comes from gut microbes and was shown to raise blood sugar and liver fat more aggressively.

To stop this, the researchers created a "gut substrate trap" -- a safe, biodegradable polymer that binds to D-lactate in the gut and prevents it from being absorbed. Mice fed this trap had lower blood glucose, less insulin resistance, and reduced liver inflammation and fibrosis -- all without changing their diet or body weight.

"This is a completely new way to think about treating metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease. Instead of targeting hormones or the liver directly, we're intercepting a microbial fuel source before it can do harm," says Schertzer, a member of the Centre for Metabolism, Obesity, and Diabetes Research (MODR) and Farncombe Family Digestive Health Research Institute at McMaster. Schertzer holds a Canada Research Chair in Metabolic Inflammation.

The research, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), highlights the growing importance of the microbiome in chronic diseases.

Tucker Carlson published a new interview with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Wednesday in which the two men discussed some pretty dark topics. Altman also talked about his beef with Elon Musk, and it wasn't long before the Tesla CEO chimed in on X with his own thoughts, definitively claiming that a whistleblower at OpenAI “was murdered,” in a tweet Thursday.

During the episode, Carlson and Altman talk about Suchir Balaji, a researcher at OpenAI who died on Nov. 26, 2024. Balaji had accused OpenAI of violating U.S. copyright law a few weeks prior to his death. And while it was ruled a suicide, his mother said he was murdered.

Carlson had Balaji's mother, Poornima Ramarao, on his podcast back in January and insisted that the 26-year-old whistleblower was murdered during his conversation with Altman.

“So you've had complaints from one programmer who said you guys were basically stealing people's stuff and not paying them. And then he wound up murdered. What was that?” Carlson said.

“Also, a great tragedy, he committed suicide,” Altman said.

Carlson pressed Altman, asking if he really thought Balaji killed himself. Altman replied, “I really do.”

“This was like a friend of mine, this was like a guy that—not a close friend, but this was someone that worked at OpenAI for a very long time,” Altman continued. “I spent… I mean, I was really shaken by this tragedy. I spent a lot of time trying to read everything I could, as I'm sure you and others did, too, about what happened. It looks like a suicide to me.”

“Why does it look like a suicide?” Carlson asked.

“It was a gun he had purchased. It was the—this is like gruesome to talk about, but I read the whole medical record. Does it not look like one to you?” Altman said.

Carlson said he definitely thinks it was murder, saying there were signs of a struggle, “surveillance wires had been cut,” among other evidence he believes proves there was foul play. Carlson also told Altman that Balaji's mother “believes he was murdered on your orders.”

Altman asked Carlson if he believed that, and Carlson tried to avoid answering before saying, “I believe that it's worth looking into.” Carlson insisted, “I'm not accusing you at all,” after Altman started to say something about being accused and was cut off.

“You understand how this sounds like an accusation…” Altman says.

“Of course. And I, I mean, I certainly… let me just be clear once again, not accusing you of any wrongdoing, but I think it's worth finding out what happened,” Carlson replied. “And I don't understand why the city of San Francisco has refused to investigate it beyond just calling it a suicide.”

Altman said that “his memory and his family deserve to be treated with a level of respect and grief that I don't quite feel here.” Carlson shot back that he was asking at the behest of his family.

Carlson pivoted to talking about Elon Musk and his attacks on Altman, asking what the “core” of their dispute might be about. Altman talked about how he's grateful to Musk for helping him start OpenAI. The two men were co-founders before Musk was pushed out of the organization.

“There are things about him that are incredible, and I'm grateful for a lot of things he's done. There's a lot of things about him that I think are traits I don't admire,” Altman said.

As Altman puts it, Musk has tried to “slow us down” ever since he got pushed out, filing lawsuits and claiming that OpenAI is betraying its original mission.

When they weren't talking about Musk, suicide, and murder, things still got very heavy. Carlson spent much of the interview either intentionally hyping the scariness of AI or being genuinely fearful of what it's capable of.

“It doesn't seem quite like a machine. It seems like it has the spark of life to it,” Carlson asked, claiming that it has some kind of “autonomy or spirit within it.”

Carlson repeatedly asked Altman about his religious beliefs. Altman said that he's Jewish, which wasn't enough for Carlson, who kept probing about whether he believed in God.

“I asked because it seems like the technology that you're creating or shepherding into existence will have more power than people… on this current trajectory,” Carlson said.

The former Fox News host badgered Altman about where he gets his “moral framework” if not from a higher power.

“I mean, like everybody else, I think the environment I was brought up in probably is the biggest thing. Like my family, my community, my school, my religion, probably that,” Altman said.

It's actually a bit baffling that Altman agreed to do this interview, given the way that Carlson discusses AI and tech leaders on his show. Carlson often talks about them as godless freaks who are trying to build their own god in the machine. And Altman seemed at times blindsided by the questions about topics like suicide, where Carlson clearly tried to portray Altman as cold and out of touch with the morality of everyday people.

“The beauty of a religion is it admits it's a religion, and it tells you what it stands for,” Carlson told Altman. “The unsettling part of this technology—not just your company, but others—is that I don't know what it stands for, but it does stand for something. And unless it admits that and tells us what it stands for, then it guides us in a kind of stealthy way toward a conclusion we may not even know we're reaching.”

The U.S. Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against Uber, accusing the ride-hailing company of violating federal law by discriminating against people with physical disabilities.  

In particular, the Department of Justice's (DOJ) civil rights division claims that the company and its drivers “routinely refuse to serve individuals with disabilities, including individuals who travel with service animals or who use stowable wheelchairs.”

Uber is also accused of charging extra fees on riders who need special accommodations, including cancellation fees when service is denied. These actions and others listed in the complaint violate the Americans with Disabilities Act, according to the DOJ.

“Despite the importance of its services to people with disabilities, Uber denies people with disabilities full and equal enjoyment of its services in several critical ways,” lawyers for the DOJ wrote. “Uber also refuses to reasonably modify its policies, practices, or procedures where necessary to avoid discriminating against riders with disabilities.” 

This has caused “significant economic, emotional, and physical harm to individuals with disabilities,” the DOJ argues.

Uber, in a statement, said it “fundamentally” disagrees with the DOJ's allegations and said it has a “a clear zero-tolerance policy for confirmed service denials.” 

“Every driver must acknowledge and agree to comply with our U.S. Service Animal Policy and all applicable accessibility laws before using the Uber Driver app, and we regularly remind drivers of these obligations. When we confirm a violation, we take decisive action, including permanent account deactivation,” the company wrote.

Uber has long faced accusations that its services are discriminatory toward people with physical disabilities. The DOJ sued the company in 2021 for overcharging those passengers. The company ultimately reached a settlement with the DOJ in 2022 where it paid out millions of dollars to more than 65,000 affected users. Uber has also been hit with a number of personal lawsuits from passengers who've alleged similar discrimination and faced public protests.

The DOJ says in the complaint, which was filed in federal court Thursday in California's Northern District, that it alerted Uber in 2024 to the fact that the company's treatment of disabled riders was being investigated. According to the complaint, after Uber became aware of this, the company rolled out a feature where passengers could self-identify that they were riding with service animals.

This story has been updated with a statement from Uber.

Far-right influencers and violent extremists are posting identifying details about people they view as celebrating or glorifying the murder of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. The campaign has been swift and widespread and has already led to at least one person losing their job and others receiving death threats.

The people posting the identifying information include Chaya Raichik, who runs the hugely influential, hate-filled LibsofTikTok account on X, Trump-whisperer Laura Loomer, and former Proud Boy leader Enrique Tarrio.

A central hub of this activity is a website called Charlie's Murderers, which was registered in the early evening on the day Kirk was shot and is revealing certain personal information, such as social media usernames and email addresses, of individuals the operators believe were celebrating the horrific murder.

One of the first names listed on the sites was Rachel Gilmore, an independent journalist at Bubble Pop Media who wrote on X that she was “terrified to think of how far-right fans of Kirk, aching for more violence, could very well turn this into an even more radicalizing moment. Will they now believe their fears have been proven right and feel they have a right to ‘retaliate,' regardless of who actually was behind the initial shooting?”

As WIRED reported, this is exactly how much of the far right—along with Republican lawmakers including President Donald Turmp—did respond to the news, even though no suspect had been arrested and no motive had been revealed.

For Gilmore, the impact of her inclusion on the website was instant and terrifying.

“This website has me genuinely afraid for my safety,” Gilmore tells WIRED. “I feel awful for anyone whose name is on it. It's clear that the purpose of the website is to do exactly what the post that landed me on there warned Kirk's supporters might do: retaliate.”

Gilmore has received multiple death and rape threats since the site went live on Wednesday evening. (WIRED reviewed screenshots of emails and direct messages Gilmore has received to verify the threats.) She has not reported the threats to the police yet, she says.

“I've gotten emails and DMs promising to find out where I live,” Gilmore says. “I have folks claiming my information is all over 4chan telling me in the same breath that they hope I get ‘raped and killed' and telling me to ‘have fun walking the streets of' my city, which they name.”

At the time of publication, two dozen people were listed on the site, with many entries including full names, employment details, location, and social media accounts. The site's operators, who are anonymous, claim to have received “thousands” of submissions. “All of them will be reviewed and uploaded shortly,” a note on the website reads. “This is a permanent archive and will soon contain a search feature.”

“Most likely, we'd be happy to answer your questions,” the people controlling the website told WIRED in an email. Subsequent emails, though, went unanswered.

The website asks people to submit a potential target's full name, location, and employer information, as well as screenshots of incriminating social media posts, via email. An About section on the website, added on Thursday morning, says: “This is not a doxxing website. This website is a lawful data aggregator of publicly-available information. It has been created for the purposes of public education.”

It continues: “We seek to collect and archive instances of individuals promoting or glorifying of political violence, much like archive.org or archive.is. We firmly denounce all political violence and criminal activity.”

Many of the allegedly incriminating posts WIRED reviewed did not glorify or promote violence. “The entire atmosphere has been stoked by conservative media and amplified by MAGA bullshit,” reads one Facebook post highlighted by the site.

“And the world kept spinning,” another person listed on the site wrote in a Facebook comment, under a post about Kirk's death.

Quinn Huddleston, another name listed on the site, told WIRED he has received “countless messages” since his name was published on the site, some urging him to take his own life. Huddleston also says that people have threatened his life, claiming to know where he lives. However, he points out that the information shared on the website was out of date and as a result the threats contained inaccurate information.

“I did not glorify anyone's death,” says Huddleston. “I don't believe political violence is the answer to anything on either side. They took a comment I made prior to [Kirk] even passing and now, as radicals usually do, spin it to work for their agenda, whatever that may be.”

A WIRED review of the social accounts linked to the people listed on the site revealed that the vast majority of them have been either deleted or set to private.

Many of the names listed on the site have already been shared on social media platforms by prominent figures seeking retribution.

“I will be spending my night making everyone I find online who celebrates his death Famous, so prepare to have your whole future professional aspirations ruined if you are sick enough to celebrate his death,” Loomer wrote on X hours after Kirk's death. “I'm going to make you wish you never opened your mouth.”

Loomer followed through on her threat in at least one instance, targeting a woman in Arizona who she claimed worked at a kids' club in a fitness center. Loomer posted a screenshot of the woman's Instagram account where she wrote: “Today's a good day y'all” under a news story about Kirk's death.

“I hope this dumb bitch is fired,” Loomer wrote, alongside a video showing her calling the woman's place of employment and speaking to her manager. “I can't imagine somebody that sick celebrating the death of a young father, who has children who are never going to know their father, working at the kids' club there,” Loomer said during the call. “I think it's a risk to the safety of the children.”

The gym where Loomer claimed the woman worked did not respond to a request for comment. WIRED was unable to contact the woman in question, and her Instagram account appears to have been deleted.

Loomer did not respond to a request for comment.

While Loomer was hoping to get someone fired, it appears Raichik succeeded.

Shortly after she highlighted that the assistant dean at the office of Student Care and Conduct at Middle Tennessee State University wrote on her Facebook page that she had “zero sympathy” for Kirk, the woman was fired.

“An MTSU employee today offered inappropriate and callous comments on social media concerning the horrific and tragic murder of Charlie Kirk,” Sidney McPhee, the school's president, said in a statement posted on the university's website. “The comments by this employee, who worked in a position of trust directly with students, were inconsistent with our values and have undermined the university's credibility and reputation with our students, faculty, staff and the community at large. This employee has been fired effective immediately.”

Another target of Raichik's was a firefighter at the New Orleans Fire Department who has since deleted her Instagram account and Facebook page. The New Orleans Fire Department did not respond to a request for comment.

Raichik did not respond to a request for comment.

“The Patriot Oasis,” a far-right news account that spreads disinformation, also used its large following to direct threats and hate toward others online. As is typical in situations like this, the account shared inaccurate information about targeted individuals. In one case, the account highlighted a video posted to Instagram by a woman who said that she was “really glad Charlie Kirk got himself fucking shot.” This woman, the account said, worked at Larkin Community Hospital.

The hospital was forced to issue a statement clarifying that the woman had completed her residency there in 2018 but has not had any affiliation with the hospital since. Despite this, another far-right account suggested on Instagram that she had been fired.

The doctor in question did not respond to WIRED requests for comment and appears to have deleted her Instagram account.

Tarrio, who had his sentence for seditious conspiracy with regards to the January 6 Capitol riot pardoned by Trump earlier this year, targeted a member of staff at a school in Miami, claiming he posted a comment on Instagram that celebrated Kirk's death. “He died. Oh well. He ironically promoted gun usage. Karma,” the person wrote according to a screenshot shared on X.

“YKWTD,” Tarrio posted on X in the early hours of Thursday morning, referring to the phrase “you know what to do.” The comment was shared alongside a screenshot of the address and phone number of the Miami Country Day School.

Neither the individual involved nor the school responded to WIRED's request for comment about the threat. Tarrio tells WIRED he is not concerned about threats that people being targeted are receiving and claims he had succeeded in getting five people fired by Thursday afternoon. When asked for details about those people, Tarrio did not provide them.

The Proud Boys are focusing our efforts into these threats and celebrations,” Tarrio says. “We will not call for violence, but we will inform their employers of who they have on staff.”

Dozens of other accounts on X, many of which have hundreds of thousands of followers, were sharing personal details about other people they saw as celebrating Kirk's murder.

“Someone could get killed or, if the harassment they're receiving is anything like what I've gotten, even engage in self-harm,” Gilmore said. “It's sick, it's wrong, and it's terrifying.”

Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell today announced a “responsible AI plan” that provides guidelines for the municipality's use of artificial intelligence and its support of the AI tech sector as an economic driver.

“We have some of the most remarkable AI assets in the country and world right here in Seattle,” said Rob Lloyd, Seattle's chief technology officer, in a GeekWire interview. 

The city ranks second behind San Francisco for AI talent by some measures, and “if we're very astute and very effective, Seattle is going to be very, very prosperous in this AI economy,” he added.

The new plan includes directions for AI training and skill-building opportunities for city employees, as well as a framework to facilitate and evaluate the use of AI tools in city operations.

Seattle has been a leader in creating guidance for AI use, and claims to be the first in the nation to issue a generative AI policy in the fall of 2023. Prior to today's announcement, Seattle already had policies requiring “human-in-the-loop” oversight, where employees must review generative AI outputs before official use and attribute any AI-assisted work to the specific technology.

An investigative series published last month by Cascade PBS, a public news organization, found that multiple Washington cities have limited guardrails around AI use, raising public trust and privacy concerns.

Seattle policy also names AI applications that are prohibited for city operations, such as in hiring processes and facial recognition products, due to concerns about the tech's performance and potential biases.  

Seattle leaders said they're trying to strike a balance that makes good use of the new technology, but doesn't compromise their fundamental obligations in serving the public.

“We have big challenges related to homelessness, housing production, public safety, those types of things,” Lloyd said. “There's a lot of things that we can do successfully using the [AI] tools, but trust is our first measure.”

The city has identified 40 priority projects in which AI could potentially improve government performance and public services. Fifteen pilot partnerships have been launched so far. They include:

The project with CivCheck is “going quite well,” said Leah Tivoli, Seattle's director of Innovation and Performance. The technology can scan thousands of permit applications for omissions and other issues that require resubmission, flagging common errors so they can be addressed and prevented. The city's ultimate goal is to reduce permitting times by half.

The intention isn't to replace city employees with technology — an approach that contrasts with tech leaders such as Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who has cited AI efficiencies as enabling workforce reductions.

“We want to be responsive to where our employees are being overwhelmed, where the community has a lot of demand, and that is ground that we can cover, where AI can help us, but that isn't displacive,” Lloyd said.

Other cities and local governments in Washington are likewise partnering with Seattle startups to deploy AI-supported services. Bellevue has a pilot with Govstream.ai to accelerate its permitting process. Aurelian is partnering with seven local governments that are using its voice technology to help 911 call centers respond to non-emergency calls.

The updated AI initiative was shared by Harrell and his team ahead of a city-led Community Innovation Hackathon being held this afternoon at Pier 70's AI House, a new startup hub partially funded by the city. The hackathon is the first in a series and aims to bring together entrepreneurs, engineers, students, city staff and others to brainstorm and develop solutions for pressing challenges.

Today's event is the Youth Connector Hackathon and focused on strategies to better connect Seattle's students with the city's 15 youth programs, which offer mental health and other support services. 

A hackathon tackling city permitting is scheduled for Oct. 9, while an event in early November will be a “reimagining” of the city's customer service, Tivoli said.

“I'm really curious to see what solutions are cringy, what solutions are exciting, and really get their perspectives,” Tivoli said. 

City leaders described the new plan, hackathons, and collaborations with groups such as AI House, AI2 Incubator (which is based at the AI House), investors, and tech companies as part of a broader push to support Seattle's AI sector.

The city wants to help “activate” the AI ecosystem in Seattle and support new innovation, Lloyd said. “Because it doesn't just happen organically,” he said. “People have to be good partners and intentional and purposeful in making sure that occurs.”

They say they autopopulate fields based on field type, but address fields are common to have an autocomplete feature enabled. That would require transmitting data before submitting the form. I didn't see anything about rating probabilities of the transmitted data being benign and useful or nefarious and malicious.

The article does talk about one example which is not considered wiretapping: a Google search field with autocomplete that's intentionally embedded in the web page.

Apple's AirPods Pro 3 are here, and with their arrival comes a lot of questions. One of the big questions after Apple's annual iPhone event is, “Should I buy new AirPods right now?” But before you can answer that, it's important to know the competition, and the main one is Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2. While both bear the “Pro” moniker in their names, they're not created equal, and small differences in features could have a big impact on which pair you ought to buy.

If you're wondering which trigger to pull, here's a breakdown of which pair of wireless earbuds does what.

See AirPods Pro 3 at Amazon

See Pixel Buds Pro 2 at Amazon

While I haven't gotten to hear Apple's AirPods Pro 3 for myself yet, these wireless earbuds have a new architecture that Apple says should bring some improvements over the last generation. According to Apple, AirPods Pro 3 have a new “multiport acoustic architecture” that better controls the airflow and the way the sound carries to the ear. How demonstrable that change is remains to be seen, but it should be the best-sounding pair of AirPods yet, if Apple's messaging is any indication.

Similarly, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 mark a significant boost in sound quality over the original iteration, with 11mm drivers that help augment both high and low ends. Which architecture delivers better sound quality will come down to preference, and we won't know for sure until we try AirPods Pro 3 for ourselves, but both should be the best-sounding version in their respective product lines. AirPods Pro 3 will have tough competition, though—we thought the Pixel Buds Pro 2 were damn near perfect.

Apple is promising some big improvements gen-over-gen with active noise cancellation (ANC), claiming that its AirPods Pro 3 have 2x the ANC capability as the AirPods Pro 2. Apple generally offers better-than-average ANC (it's not Bose QuietComfort Ultra, but it's good), so double the ANC is an enticing offer. Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 also offer double the ANC over the first generation, and as we stated in our review, it is one of the highlights of the buds overall.

One thing that could give AirPods Pro 3 the edge, however, is a redesigned eartip that contains foam inside. That should make a very tight seal in your ear and provide good passive noise cancellation on top of ANC. Again, it's hard to say without hearing the AirPods Pro 3 for ourselves, but there's a chance that AirPods Pro 3 could have an X factor here.

One of the biggest AirPods improvements gen-over-gen, according to Apple, is in the battery life department. AirPods Pro 3 now have an 8-hour battery life outside of the case with ANC on, which is two more hours than the AirPods Pro 2. The thing is, we're comparing to Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2, which also have 8 hours of battery life outside the case, meaning this part of the showdown could be a tie.

That being said, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 do have a better battery life in the case. While AirPods Pro 3 have a 24-hour battery life in the case with ANC on, Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 have 30 hours. Case battery isn't the biggest metric for success, but more is more when it comes to battery.

Features are where things get interesting and potentially where AirPods Pro 3 pull away. While both wireless earbuds have AI integrations (Google has Gemini, and AirPods Pro have Apple Intelligence), conversation detection, support for head gestures, and adaptive ANC, and even live translation abilities, Apple's AirPods Pro 3 lean into health sensing as well.

AirPods Pro 3 introduces a heart rate sensor that allows the wireless earbuds to be used for tracking workouts and even calories burned, while Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 have no such health features. Whether that's a game-changer is entirely up to you, but it's clear that AirPods Pro 3 just do more in that department. Maybe Google will close the gap with its next pair of wireless earbuds, but for now, Apple has the advantage, especially if you're using an iPhone.

Apple clearly spent a lot of time redesigning its AirPods Pro 3. Specifically, Apple says that it used “over 10,000 ear scans with more than 100,000 hours of user research” to tweak the fit of AirPods Pro 3. It also changed the “external geometry of the eartip,” which now aligns to the center of the body for more stability. Those changes could very well result in an even more comfortable fit and give AirPods an edge here.

With that said, we gave the Pixel Buds Pro 2 high marks for comfort, so Apple has its work cut out. Apple does objectively now have more eartip sizes than Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2—five instead of Google's four—but that doesn't necessarily mean they're more comfortable, even if they do have more fit options. If I were a betting man, I'd put my money on Apple in the fit metric, if just because they seem to have exhaustively redesigned the AirPods Pro 3 and focused on the weight and feel.

While the AirPods Pro 3 are more expensive than the Pixel Buds Pro 2, they're also brand new, and the price isn't drastically different. Apple's AirPods Pro 3 are $250, while Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 are $230. What's notable is that Apple didn't raise the price of its wireless earbuds, making the AirPods Pro 3 feel like a solid deal. Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 are almost exactly a year old at this point, and while $230 isn't the most expensive starting price for wireless earbuds, it's not a massive discount. That being said, we'll be able to tell you which price is worth it once we actually test the AirPods Pro 3 ourselves.

CoMotion, the office that handles technology transfer at the University of Washington, has laid off three employees amid broader financial challenges at the Seattle-based institution. 

A university spokesperson confirmed the layoffs in a statement to GeekWire. CoMotion initially tried to reduce expenses through spending reductions, according to the university, but it was not enough.

“When looking at staff reductions, CoMotion tried to keep the infrastructure in place to support research translation and commercialization while minimizing operational impacts and services it provides to the UW community,” a spokesperson said in a statement. 

Among the roles cut were the director of marketing and communications; one writer; and an IT project manager role. There are now 52 employees at CoMotion. 

CoMotion last year moved into a new building on the UW campus in Seattle. The office helps researchers launch startups and secure patents for their discoveries. It also offers co-working space and runs several incubators, including a new fintech program.

The UW is facing a budget crisis due in part to funding cuts from the state and federal government. Former President Ana Mari Cauce, who stepped down this summer, said in May that she expected the university to make layoffs due to the budget hole.

Along with government funding cuts, the UW is also grappling with rising benefits costs and international students turning to other countries, the Seattle Times reported last month. The Times reported that federal cuts and “other actions” have led to 178 layoffs at the UW.

The U.S. House Appropriations Committee on Wednesday expressed support for several NASA missions that currently sit on the chopping block as a result of the administration's 2026 budget proposal. While the committee did not specifically allocate more money to these missions, the support breathes new life into planetary science efforts that have been years in the making.

The House committee met to discuss the commerce, justice, and science budget bill, which allocates funding to federal agencies like NASA. The bill secures more than $24.8 billion for NASA, about the same amount the agency received in 2024 and 2025—much higher than the administration's previously proposed $18.8 billion for 2026.

The committee approved the bill in a 34-28 vote; it will now advance to the full House for a vote. Congress's deadline to finalize individual appropriations bills—October 1—is fast approaching.

During the meeting, the committee adopted amendments to a report accompanying the bill, adding the New Horizons mission exploring the Kuiper Belt, NASA's Juno mission probing Jupiter and its moons, and a series of lower-cost robotic missions to Mars as part of the bill. Although the report didn't specify an amount of funds that should go toward these missions, it suggests they have broad support from the committee.

“The Committee supports NASA's request to establish a regular cadence of science-driven, lower-cost mission and hosted instrument opportunities to Mars,” the report reads. The committee also recommended that NASA deliver these new missions and instruments alongside its commercial partners.

The report also included a new section regarding the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, announcing new funding for the telescope. Chandra, which launched in 1999 as the world's most powerful x-ray telescope, has been delivering high-resolution data on black holes, supernovae, and galaxy clusters ever since. The administration's budget request, however, called for its termination.

The White House's proposed budget for 2026, released in May, would reduce NASA's funding by $6 billion compared to 2025. Under that proposal, NASA's planetary science budget would drop from $2.7 billion to $1.9 billion.

That would kill dozens of active and planned missions, including New Horizons. The spacecraft, which launched on January 19, 2006, traveled 9 billion miles in nine and a half years , becoming the first mission to reach Pluto. Hailed as one of the most successful planetary missions, it revealed that the icy planetessimal and its moons are far more complex than scientists had initially assumed.

Seattle-based security and application delivery giant F5 will pay $180 million to acquire CalypsoAI, a startup founded in 2018 that helps companies secure their generative AI infrastructure. 

The deal is financed primarily with cash and is expected to close this month, F5 said in a news release.

Founded in 2018 with offices in Ireland and New York City, Calypso provides real-time threat defense and other data security products to customers deploying AI-related workloads. 

“AI is redefining enterprise architecture — and the attack surface companies must defend,” François Locoh-Donou, president and CEO of F5, said in a statement.

CalypsoAI raised $23 million in 2023. Its backers include Paladin Capital Group; Lockheed Martin Ventures; Hakluyt Capital; Expeditions Fund; and others.

“Our customers rely on us to pressure test AI systems at scale, set inference layer guardrails that adapt as models change, and to gain visibility and auditability across their AI estate,” CalypsoAI CEO Donnchadh Casey said in a statement. 

Funding to cybersecurity startups reached a three-year high in the first half of 2025.

F5 acquired San Francisco cybersecurity startup Fletch in June and swooped up observability company MantisNet in August.

F5 topped estimates for its fiscal third quarter, with revenue up 12% to $780 million. GAAP net income was $190 million, up from $144 million.

The company's stock is up more than 30% this year.

Welcome to another episode of Americans being badly behaved in Australia (anyone remember the wombat grabber?). In this edition, Australian officials, wildlife experts, and others are criticizing U.S.-based influencer Mike Holston, aka “therealtarzann” on social media, after he posted two videos of himself down under and tackling crocodiles, shirtless.

Queensland officials have confirmed that they are “actively investigating two videos circulating on social media,” The Guardian reporteed. Meanwhile, Bob Irwin—father of Australia's Crocodile Hunter, the late Steve Irwin—condemned Holston's behavior.

“When people compare the behaviour of blokes like Mike Holston to what Steve did, or claim they were influenced by him, it really gets under my skin,” Irwin said, as reported by the Brisbane Times. “You can't even put them in the same sentence. Everything Steve did … was to respect wildlife.”

Steve Irwin was an Australian wildlife conservationist and TV personality who developed successful crocodile capture and management techniques. He passed away in 2006 after being stung by a stingray.

In the most recent of two crocodile videos, Holston appears to chase a young saltwater crocodile into tall grass alongside a riverbank. In the next shot he holds the reptile up for the camera, squeezing the animal aggressively on the throat, draping the rest of its body over his leg.

Saltwater crocodiles are the largest reptile on Earth and considered to be extremely dangerous, but the one Holston is holding is small and appears motionless in the video. Experts have voiced concerns about this poor croc, with Irwin saying in a statement that it may be showing signs of dangerous stress. Holston releases the crocodile at the end of the video and has defended his actions.

In the other video, the influencer appears to chase after a freshwater crocodile in shallow water. In the video, he leaps onto the animal, and the two tussle as the cameraperson approaches, revealing a bloody injury on Holston's arm. “He got ahold of me,” Holston seems to say in the video. “But I got ahold of him!”

Unlike the saltwater crocodile, this one appears to make distressed noises before thrashing out of Holston's grip.

Both of the posts are tagged with the location of Lockhart River, Queensland.

Gizmodo has reached out to Holston for comment.

A spokesperson for Queensland's environment department said it was a “significant offence to interfere with freshwater crocodiles in Queensland, not to mention extremely dangerous,” ABC Australia reported.

Last year, Queensland introduced new legislation in a bid to prevent dangerous crocodile interactions. Bob Irwin and others nicknamed it “dickhead legislation,” according to The Guardian. “And that's because that's exactly what content creators like the Real Tarzann are in my books – dickheads,” he explained.

Apple fans who normally gravitate to the Pro-level iPhones need to rethink their buying habits. The upcoming $1,100 iPhone 17 Pro isn't better than the regular 17 for any obvious reason you can glean from staring at the pleasing orange surface. You have to look below the aluminum and beyond the giant camera bump to see what's really going on. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are finally stepping out of the amateur league and are going “pro,” as their names suggest.

The regular iPhone 17 sounds like too good of a deal. As detailed during the company's showcase, the base smartphone has the same 6.3-inch, 120Hz AMOLED display as the iPhone 17 Pro. The higher refresh rate was once exclusive to Apple's premium phones. It carries the same high brightness spec for use outdoors and Ceramic Shield 2 to protect the screen from scratches. The iPhone 17 contains everything from the iPhone 16 lineup, including the Camera Control button, plus new features like the 18-megapixel Center Stage front camera. It now comes with a base 256GB of internal storage, twice as much as the base iPhone 16's 128GB, all for the same cost as last year's $800 iPhone.

So why are we even talking about the iPhone 17 Pro at all? Because it's what's inside that matters. The iPhone 17 Pro is shaping up to be an actual “pro”-level device. It starts with performance. New Geekbench 6 synthetic benchmark scores published over the past two days show the iPhone 17 Pro Max hitting high scores in both CPU and GPU tests. The iPhone 17 Pro Max scored around 45,995 on the Metal GPU test. That's about as high as Apple's M2 chip in a 6th-gen iPad Pro.

As for CPU scores, the iPhone 17 Pro Max shows that it hits a little under 4,000 in single-thread tests and a little over 9,700 in multi-core settings. Single-core tests determine how fast a CPU can handle a single task at a time. It's about 15% better than what we saw with the A18 Pro in the iPhone 16 Pro/16 Pro Max. Apple already suggested its A19 Pro would be better in single-thread performance, so that claim may check out. A Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip—currently one of the best CPUs for Android available—in the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra scores around 2,800 in single-core and 9,400 in multi-core tests. We don't know how the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 (or whatever it's called) will shake out, but for now the A19 Pro is beating the competition on Android.

As a PC guy, I have to resist the urge to start comparing the A19 and A19 Pro to laptop or desktop-level chips. Apple's ARM-based chips for mobile are designed for entirely different operating systems. A laptop chip needs to handle more intensive and sustained processes for longer. But that's where things get interesting. Apple said in its announcement post that the iPhone 17 Pro is built for “sustained performance.” Apple seems to be suggesting it wants its Pro-level users to use its new phone for video editing, gaming, or anything that pushes the graphics processing capabilities more than ever before.

That's why Apple stressed the new vapor chamber cooling in the iPhone 17 Pro models. This helps move heat away from the CPU by spreading that energy across a wider surface. The addition should cool the phone at a faster rate than previous Pro models, which are notorious for getting hot along the battery. Apple also went with aluminum instead of titanium, likely because it's better for thermals. While Apple still hasn't revealed battery capacity specs for any of its iPhone 17 lineup, Apple has suggested the iPhone 17 Pro Max model will have one of its largest batteries to date.

The iPhone Air is the most controversial—and therefore interesting—mobile device of Apple's new smartphone slate. It even has the same A19 Pro chip as the iPhone 17 Pro, though with one less GPU core. And we don't expect it to match the iPhone 17 Pro while using intensive apps. Of course, we all know the real reason you want the iPhone 17 Pro is for the Cosmic Orange colorway. But if you're spending $1,100 on any device, you should make sure you'll be doing more than staring slack-jawed at its pretty hue.

Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav has stated that HBO Max will become more expensive, while also making it harder to share passwords, as first reported by The Hollywood Reporter. Zaslav spoke about the future of the streaming service at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference.

“The fact that this is quality — and that's true across our company, motion picture, TV production, and streaming quality — we all think that gives us a chance to raise price,” he said. “We think we're way underpriced.”

Zaslav also said that the streaming service's crackdown on passwords will be coming in the future. 

“We haven't been pushing on the password sharing and the economics yet,” he said. “People are really starting to love HBO Max. That's the key. We want them to fall in love with our content, with our series, with the differentiated offering outside of the U.S. It's all tricky with the password sharing. We're going to begin to push on that.”

Currently, a Basic with Ads plan costs $9.99 per month, a Standard plan costs $16.99 per month, and a Premium plan costs $20.99 per month.

REDMOND, Wash. — Microsoft is preparing to go deeper into “human-to-human-to-AI collaboration,” one of the company's top AI executives said this week — signaling plans for a broader rollout of features to let people work with each other and AI at the same time.

“So far, AI-based work has been kind of a solo sport, and this fall it will clearly become a team sport, where you'll be working together with other people and AI,” said Jared Spataro, Microsoft's chief marketing officer for AI at Work, during a conference Tuesday at the company's headquarters.

Microsoft introduced Copilot Pages last year as a persistent canvas for “multiplayer AI collaboration” in Microsoft 365. Spataro's comments indicate that the company is preparing to expand on that vision. He noted that partners such as OpenAI will also play a role.

The company is facing a strong field of competitors, with others such as Google, Slack, Zoom, and AI startups similarly rolling out chatbots and agents for teams to use collaboratively.

Spataro said these kinds of features could create a new degree of viral adoption for Copilot, the company's AI productivity platform, similar to how Microsoft Teams grew quickly during the pandemic when people began sending each other meeting invites.

His comments were part of a session about trends in AI for business Tuesday at the Microsoft Alumni Network Connect 2025 conference. The discussion with Spataro was led by Bill Kirst, an AI ambassador and change manager for Adobe Technology Services. 

More takeaways from Spataro's remarks: 

AI is increasingly blurring the lines between different kinds of jobs. 

With AI agents lowering what Spataro called “the marginal cost of expertise” to zero, people will increasingly be able to handle tasks across roles that were previously considered specialties. 

He pointed to the “full-stack developer” as a model. In the past, building software often required separate specialists for design, front-end, and back-end work. 

Spataro noted that LinkedIn, the Microsoft-owned social network, is already seeing this shift, with some designers writing as much code as developers thanks to AI tools. 

Up to this point, he observed, the modern economy has put people into narrow roles that limit their broader impact. AI could free individuals to contribute more widely, reversing a trend dating back to the division of labor described by Adam Smith, the 18th-century economist often called the father of modern economics.

“I think that's pretty darn cool,” Spataro said. “From our perspective, that would be the unleashing of human ingenuity that somewhat has been locked up because the economy has become uber-specialized.”

AI is changing how companies think about career development. 

Spataro noted that experienced professionals tend to get more out of tools like Copilot because they can better judge the quality of AI outputs. Recognizing this, he said, some companies are revisiting apprenticeship programs — pairing experienced employees with newer workers to help them build the judgment and skills to work effectively with AI tools.

AI's value can be hard to quantify at the individual level. 

Spataro recalled thinking early on that Microsoft 365 Copilot would be a no-brainer at $30 per user per month, but he later realized that, while people see plenty of “aha” moments, the cost can be much tougher to justify based on personal productivity alone. 

“I thought, holy smokes, this thing, who's not going to want to pay $30 a month for this?” he said. “Boy, did I learn a lesson.”

He said the real ROI emerges at the organizational level, where companies can measure process improvements and cost savings — in some cases reducing operating expenses by hundreds of millions of dollars.

AI is starting to rival professional work quality. 

Spataro described how his own team recently turned to Copilot, powered by GPT-5, when they were struggling to frame ideas for a research project with Harvard. Instead of handling routine tasks, the AI acted as a true thought partner — combining concepts, generating polished prose, and helping resolve disagreements over language. 

“For the first time, we felt like we could have gone out to an agency and we wouldn't have gotten better,” he said. “So that was one that was very inspiring to us. It wasn't that it was replacing us or the writers or some of the research leads on my team, but it was definitely making us better.”

Microsoft sees a new kind of organization emerging in the AI era. 

Spataro described these “frontier firms” as human-led, agent-operated — with people setting direction while AI agents carry out much of the work. He outlined three patterns Microsoft is watching closely: humans working with an assistant, humans teaming with agents, and processes where agents manage other agents. 

“Humans still play, we think, an incredibly important role, but they do the leading, and then, as much as possible, agents are operating a lot of what happens,” he said.

The pandemic set the stage for today's AI boom. 

Spataro said the sudden shift to remote and hybrid work forced companies to digitize communication and collaboration, creating the data and habits that AI systems now build upon. “We don't believe that we could have the world of AI that we have today without the pandemic that we had yesterday,” he said.

Apple launched a slate of new iPhones on Tuesday loaded with the company's new A19 and A19 Pro chips. Along with an ultrathin iPhone Air and other redesigns, the new phones come with a less flashy upgrade that could turn out to be the true killer feature. A security improvement called Memory Integrity Enforcement combines always-on, chip-level protections with software defenses in an effort to harden iPhones against the most common—and commonly exploited—software vulnerabilities.

In recent years, a movement has been steadily growing across the global tech industry to address a ubiquitous and insidious type of bugs known as memory-safety vulnerabilities. A computer's memory is a shared resource among all programs, and memory safety issues crop up when software can pull data that should be off limits from a computer's memory or manipulate data in memory that shouldn't be accessible to the program. When developers—even experienced and security-conscious developers—write software in ubiquitous, historic programming languages, like C and C++, it's easy to make mistakes that lead to memory safety vulnerabilities. That's why proactive tools like special programming languages have been proliferating with the goal of making it structurally impossible for software to contain these vulnerabilities, rather than attempting to avoid introducing them or catch all of them.

“The importance of memory safety cannot be overstated,” the US National Security Agency and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency wrote in a June report. “The consequences of memory safety vulnerabilities can be severe, ranging from data breaches to system crashes and operational disruptions.”

Apple's Swift programming language, released in 2014, is memory-safe. The company says it has been writing new code in Swift for years as well as attempting to strategically overhaul and rewrite existing code in the memory-safe language to make its systems more secure. This reflects the challenge of memory safety across the industry, because even if new code is written more securely, the world's software was all written in memory-unsafe languages for decades. And while, in general, Apple's locked down ecosystem has so far succeeded at preventing widespread malware attacks against iPhones, motivated attackers, particularly spyware makers, do still develop complex iOS exploit chains at high cost to target specific victims' iPhones.

Even with the work Apple has done to begin overhauling its code for memory safety, the company has found that these rarefied attack chains virtually always still include exploitation of memory bugs.

“Known mercenary spyware chains used against iOS share a common denominator with those targeting Windows and Android: they exploit memory safety vulnerabilities, which are interchangeable, powerful, and exist throughout the industry,” Apple wrote in its Memory Integrity Enforcement announcement on Wednesday.

Apple has increasingly invested in memory safety with Swift and secure memory allocators that manage which regions of memory are “allocated” and “deallocated” for which data—a major factor in, and source of, memory safety vulnerabilities. But Memory Integrity Enforcement itself was originally inspired by work at the hardware level to protect code integrity even when a system has suffered memory corruption.

With memory-unsafe programming languages underlying so much of the world's collective code base, Apple's Security Engineering and Architecture team felt that putting memory safety mechanisms at the heart of Apple's chips could be a deus ex machina for a seemingly intractable problem. The group built on a specification known as Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) released in 2019 by the chipmaker Arm. The idea was to essentially password protect every memory allocation in hardware so that future requests to access that region of memory are only granted by the system if the request includes the right secret.

Arm developed MTE as a tool to help developers find and fix memory corruption bugs. If the system receives a memory access request without passing the secret check, the app will crash and the system will log the sequence of events for developers to review. Apple's engineers wondered whether MTE could run all the time rather than just being used as a debugging tool, and the group worked with Arm to release a version of the specification for this purpose in 2022 called Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension.

To make all of this a constant, real-time defense against exploitation of memory safety vulnerabilities, Apple spent years architecting the protection deeply within its chips so the feature could be on all the time for users without sacrificing overall processor and memory performance. In other words, you can see how generating and attaching secrets to every memory allocation and then demanding that programs manage and produce these secrets for every memory request could dent performance. But Apple says that it has been able to thread the needle.

Memory Integrity Enforcement “is built right into Apple hardware and software in all models of iPhone 17 and iPhone Air and offers unparalleled, always-on memory safety protection for our key attack surfaces including the kernel, while maintaining the power and performance that users expect,” Apple wrote in the announcement.

The company also released a version of the Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension specification for all Apple developers in Xcode so app makers can start to incorporate the protection into their products. Researchers who participate in Apple's special device program will also be encouraged to test and attack Memory Integrity Enforcement in the new version of the devices that contain A19 series chips.

Apple has often been criticized for how restrictive its walled-garden ecosystem can be, including when lack of transparency prevents security researchers from fully vetting Apple's systems. But the approach has also proved effective in many ways. And initial reactions to the announcement about Memory Integrity Enforcement were largely positive given the security benefits it promises.

“The deep integration of Apple's ecosystem means that security enhancements like Memory Integrity Enforcement have an enormous impact on overall user security and privacy,” says Alex Zenla, chief technology officer of the sandbox cloud security firm Edera. “Security can be effectively built-in from the ground up when properly designed.”

The best compliment I could ever lay at the feet of any game streaming service is that I can forget I was even using it. Nvidia's GeForce Now service, which lets players run their own game library through the cloud, is better than ever with its most recent update. As a bonus, Nvidia's $20-per-month “Ultimate” subscription doesn't cost any more than it did previously, unlike TV streaming's constant price gouging. Just know that when I say the service has improved, I mean the service is better at everything it was already great for.

Is streaming the future of gaming? No, especially not for multiplayer. But when PC and console prices are more expensive than ever, GeForce Now could fill in the gaps when hardware starts to falter.

GeForce Now RTX 5080 Update

The performance uplift may not be significant for some games, but GeForce Now makes PC gaming far more accessible.

Pros

Cons

Nvidia let me try out its update to GeForce Now early, before it started rolling out to users on Wednesday. It upgrades some games to use a better GPU, dampens server latency, and makes games look better. As much as that sounds like a good deal, let's remember who is making use of cloud gaming in the first place. Gamers running systems that can't play today's AAA games, whether they're not powerful enough or incompatible altogether, can instead stream the game to their system for the cost of two large artisan coffees each month. That hasn't changed with the update, but now PC players with a Steam backlog may be able to play far more games using Nvidia's new Install-to-Play feature.

Nvidia's latest update to GeForce Now allows some games to run on systems with the GeForce RTX 5080 GPU, rather than the last-gen RTX 4080. Not all games support this at launch, though titles that can get performance uplift with the new GPU, including older titles like Cyberpunk 2077 and new games such as Borderlands 4, benefit from extra frame rates and more graphics options. You may find you can push some titles with ray tracing settings that you weren't able to before. I could get Cyberpunk 2077 running with path tracing enabled for ultra-realistic lighting effects and still have more than enough frame rates that I wasn't completely relying on digital tricks or so-called “fake frames.”

Nvidia claims it pushed latency down as much as possible below 30ms to make games feel more seamless. That would be enough to receive my paternalistic nod of approval, but Nvidia also touts the RTX 5080's multi-frame gen capabilities as a big reason why users should jump on the streaming bandwagon. This is an RTX 50-series Blackwell-exclusive software feature that inserts multiple generated—aka “fake”—frames in between each rendered frame, artificially increasing frame rates for more responsive gameplay. It's the kind of feature that sounds great on paper, but in practice is more constrained. Users need to achieve more than 50 fps normally to make multi-frame gen work without introducing odd graphical glitches. Frame generation also introduces more latency, though Nvidia said it was able to tamp down on sluggishness with some help from its updated SuperPOD servers.

I tried games with and without frame gen, and in most cases, I still think gamers can go without. In Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, I pushed it up to beyond 250 fps with 4x frame gen, and the experience didn't feel any better than without any frame gen running at around 90 fps. The added latency runs counter to smooth frame rates. Plus, 90 fps is more than playable for single-player titles.

If you can afford a 360Hz monitor, which is now supported by GeForce Now, you can probably afford a non-streaming gaming device. And if you're using a high-refresh-rate display, you're likely playing multiplayer games. I could jump into Overwatch 2 or Counter-Strike 2 through streaming and about as well as usual (re: awful), but pushing the refresh rate to 360Hz also pares down the resolution to 1080p. Streaming is not the arena for competitive multiplayer. I doubt it ever could be.

I wasn't as interested in running these games on my usual gaming PC. If you can play these games natively, then there's no reason you should be spending an extra $20 on top of however much you blow on the next Steam sale. Instead, I wanted to see what happens when using devices like a 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 chip, a Steam Deck, and even an Nvidia Shield set-top box, which—like a spunky grandfather—is still kicking despite its age.

Nvidia claims it reduced latency enough to enjoy games online or offline, but the real reason you get GeForce Now is to play your games without spending money on new hardware. Streaming is notorious for introducing odd visuals into high-fidelity 3D games. To remedy this, Nvidia introduced a new “Cinematic” quality mode that enhances colors and sharpens certain objects, like trees. This means a game like Assassin's Creed: Shadows appears sharper than it did in previous versions of GeForce Now. The extra visual quality was enough to entice me to put a few more hours into a game I had already harangued back at launch.

I took screenshots of both Baldur's Gate III and Cyberpunk 2077 running natively and streaming on my 14-inch MacBook Pro. There are obvious quality differences between the two, plus Nvidia's base HDR settings result in an overall darker image than natively. It's a fully playable experience, but I still noticed a loss in detail on some terrain in Baldur's Gate III and fuzz,y far-distant objects in Cyberpunk 2077.

Of course, I was getting better frame rates through GeForce Now than playing each game on a MacBook Pro with M4 chip. For single player games, the latency never became a problem on my home Wi-Fi. Packet loss, where data goes missing moving between your device and the server, is also kept manageable. I do not have the best home Wi-Fi, but in tests, my internet bandwidth usually sits at 75Mbps with a 26ms latency. That's more than enough for me to stream at 4K and even the new 5K resolution at 120 fps. Other people may not be so lucky to have the 54Mbps minimum required to achieve the highest resolution possible on GeForce Now.

Nvidia updated its existing Steam Deck app to play games with support for up to 90Hz refresh rate. Of all the devices I've tested with Nvidia's streaming service, handhelds and other mobile devices are where GeForce Now shines. You can push the resolution in games beyond the Steam Deck's 800p display, which will help reduce artifacts that pop up from streaming. I can settle down and play from lying down on my bed. Nvidia also released a version of the app for the Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS to support 120Hz gaming. That 8.8-inch display and 1200p resolution combine well with an RTX 5080 GPU to offer strong performance across titles. If the SteamOS handhelds are the most console-like devices you can take with you, then GeForce Now makes it so much easier to enjoy games without having to worry nearly as much about frame rate dips or battery life.

You still won't find titles like Elden Ring available to stream on GeForce Now. However, Nvidia effectively opened up servers for users to download a whole host of new titles. These games remain on the servers until you log off, though you can rent out that space for an extra $3 a month if you want your games to remain.

Currently, Install-to-Play is mostly filled with the kind of older games or indie titles that don't normally require much graphical power, which in turn means they don't have enormous file sizes that take hours to download on Nvidia's remote PCs. Going through the staggering 4,700 titles, you may think there are more games than it's possible to try. Still, out of the 441 games in my Steam Library, only 15 of them were available through Install-to-Play. That ignores the titles that are fully streaming-ready on the service, which would push the actual number to 359 across my Steam, Epic, and Xbox libraries. Nvidia said it plans to add more games to the service as more developers opt in.

Downloading games on these cloud-based PCs didn't take much hassle. I could already play games like Mark of the Ninja perfectly well on my Steam Deck, but having access to it on my phone, should I want it, is a treat. I only hope Nvidia doesn't use this feature to eventually dump games that are less played from its official servers, but at least we know we'll still be able to download them, should that ever happen.

GeForce Now is becoming more and more a go-to for me and my personal gaming habits. I enjoy using my Steam Deck at home for playing through Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and then taking the device on the road to run through compatible games like Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader. I'm at a point in my gaming life where my consoles and PCs are like chains that keep me tied to a desk or across a TV. I know the good times can't last forever, and I'm waiting for the hammer blow of increased subscription costs or the inevitable enshittification that comes to all streaming services.

Microsoft's fall update is now just a download away, but support won't be available until general availability later this year.

Microsoft has released ISO install media for Windows 11 version 25H2, the next feature update in its annual release cycle. As of September 10, official ISOs are available via the Windows Insider download page, providing testers with a clean install path ahead of the update's general availability later this year.

Build 26200.5074 hit the Release Preview Channel on August 29, with Microsoft confirming the update is being delivered as an “enablement package.” This means that it installs over the existing 24H2 base rather than replacing it with a full new build. This is the same approach that Microsoft has used in previous fall updates, such as 22H2 and 23H2, and allows for a smaller, faster update that leaves core system components untouched.

The ISO release provides users with more control over how and when they upgrade. Instead of waiting for Windows Update to deliver the patch, testers can perform an in-place upgrade by mounting the ISO or carry out a full reinstall by creating a bootable media with tools like Rufus. As Windows Central reports, the ISO file weighs in at around 7 GB, depending on language.

Although 25H2 isn't bringing any major changes to Windows 11, there are several major changes under the hood. On managed Enterprise and Education devices, admins can now uninstall a curated list of Microsoft Store apps, part of the company's broader effort to streamline business deployments. Depreciated legacy tools like PowerShell 2.0 and WMIC have also been removed.

25H2 support will begin at general availability and not during the preview period. While many devices are only just now receiving 24H2, it was finalized earlier this year and only receives 24 months of updates (36 months for Enterprise/Education). Once 25H2 is officially released, it will reset that clock, meaning testers who adopt it now will eventually get a longer runway for security features and updates.

Microsoft hasn't provided an exact launch date for 25H2, but if past timelines are any guide, general availability will likely land in October, lining up with the usual cadence.

This pizza oven goes to 11. At least it says it does. A mere 20 minutes or so after firing up the new All-Clad Gas Pizza Oven—the beloved pot-and-pan brand's first real foray into outdoor cooking—the oven's temperature gauge has gone deep into uncharted territory.

The dial's markings top out at around 900 degrees Fahrenheit, but the thermometer's needle is somewhere in no man's land, well above what might register as a thousand if its thermometer weren't busy shrugging. My infrared temperature gun seems inclined to agree, depending where I point it inside the oven, though the surface of the All-Clad's thick 16-inch pizza stone is still hanging manageably below 900 degrees.

Consider this an announcement: All-Clad did not come to play.

The propane-powered, 16-inch All-Clad is a powerful new entrant in the still young world of accessible backyard pizza ovens, a landscape whose first decade was mostly a scorched-wood duel between the English and the Scots—Ooni and Gozney, respectively. (See WIRED's guide to the best pizza ovens.)

All-Clad is making a case that new ideas are still out there. The oven's big sell, aside from its gaping 16-inch maw, is a rotating pizza stone that's meant to take a lot of the fuss out of cooking pizza evenly. (The All-Clad isn't alone. The lower-cost Versa 16 from Halo, which I'm currently testing, also offers a rotating stone.)

In the process, the All-Clad places itself as a genuine contender among top pizza ovens. Once I cooled the oven back down into more reasonable temperatures, I have used this All-Clad to make pies both neo-Neapolitan and New York, baked pies from fresh and frozen alike, seared a handsome ribeye steak, and cooked veggies that ranged from charred to even more charred.

I'll get into the specs later. But first, I want to talk about the oven's most salient feature: that rotating pizza stone. Is it really as exciting as all that? In short, yes. Yes, it is. It's likely to be especially attractive to first-time pizza makers, and those who turn out a lot of pies rapidly.

Most pizza ovens heat from a single primary source. And so pizza brands like Ooni have devoted considerable effort to modeling the interior domed shape of their ovens. With propane models that heat from a rim of fire in the back, the idea is to entice flames to lick up and over the dome, creating even heat around the oven, thus heating the stone evenly.

But in practice, there will always be an unavoidable temperature gradient, even as you turn the flames down to cook your pizza. And so when baking a pizza in most backyard ovens, a turning peel will end up being your closest friend. On a Neapolitan-style pie cooking at above 800 degrees Fahrenheit, you might turn a pie four times in the 90 seconds or so your pizza takes to bake fully, reaching into and out of the oven with your long pizza spatula.

It is a process that requires constant attention, maybe even love. For many home pizza cooks, the process of meticulously monitoring and turning their pie to ensure an even bake is a lot of the art and fun of making pizza. But let's say you'd rather just stick the pizza in the oven, then pull it out when it's done? That's what the lazy Susan in this All-Clad is for.

Press the button (its motor is powered by four AA batteries) and the pizza stone will rotate at the leisurely pace of one revolution every 40 seconds or so. If you start this rotation while the oven is preheating, the stone will also heat up beautifully evenly across its surface.

And so when you lay your pizza down to bake, instead of poking and turning and guessing, you can simply watch the browning happen—and pull your pie at the right moment. The right moment, in my experience, is gauged by watching the leading edge of your crust as it spins your way from the hot rear of the oven.

If that leading visible edge is perfect, that's the moment to locate the included pizza peel. By the time you actually pull your pizza, 10 or 15 seconds later, this perfection will likely have spread across the entire rim of your pizza.

God bless: It's a feature I was truly grateful for. An extra motor is also probably an added failure point, I'll grant—a worry somewhat assuaged by the All-Clad's two-year warranty.

Aside from this elegant spin and its capacious diameter allowing for 16-inch pizzas, the All-Clad will probably remind you of a lot of other high-end propane pizza ovens on the market. The pewter-black, stainless steel oven is handsomely minimalist, if a bit boxy compared to dome-ier competitors—with a prominent All-Clad badge in the front and handy fold-up legs for less bulky storage.

It's priced for luxury, originally listed at a hefty $1,300. But in practice, the All-Clad has been discounted by as much as $500, bringing it in line with other high-end competitors like the 18-inch Ooni Koda 2 Pro.

Assembly is nearly nil: About 50 percent of putting the thing together is just untucking the four legs that serve as its stand. Otherwise, one must simply add a couple buffer stones and center the hefty 16-inch cordierite stone atop its metal perch. Attach a propane tank, press down on the dial to trigger the igniter, and run the oven through a heating cycle to get rid of whatever factory dust remains.

Temperature is controlled by a simple dial that controls the amplitude of the gas jets at the rear of the oven: In practice, it might take you a couple tries to arrive at the target temperature, but operation is pretty intuitive.

The oven is neither too heavy nor overly light, about 46 pounds, if you plan on carting it into and out of storage. But for that, it's pretty well insulated. When the oven has topped 1,000, the top and sides of the device might crest 200 degrees Fahrenheit, but the bottom remains quite cool—meaning you don't have to worry it'll scorch whatever it's perched on.

And as mentioned, the All-Clad heats up quickly. It's about 10 minutes to reach 600 degrees Fahrenheit, and five more to get up to 900. Heating the stone may take a little longer, but there's blessedly little lag between thinking about pizza and making a pizza.

But every virtue can also be a flaw. The high power and fast heat-up on this All-Clad can mean it's easy to overshoot your target if you blast the thing on high—which then means you'll need to wait a bit to cool it back down. I've found it's better to heat the thing up at two-thirds intensity, rather than risk going way over the top.

Dialing in the right temp is more difficult for lower-temperature pizzas like New York or thin-crust pies that might be cooked below 700 degrees. This oven loves to be hot, and so “lower” temperatures like a mere 650 degrees do require some fine-tuning. Note also that the built-in thermometer seems a more accurate gauge for the top of the oven than the bottom. Don't throw away your infrared thermometer, which you'll still need to monitor the surface temperature of your pizza stone.

Now, does too much power amount to a damning flaw, especially if you're a lover of the two-minute Neapolitan? No, it does not. It's a bit like a job-seeker declaring that they're “too much of a perfectionist.”

There are also a couple caveats with the rotating stone. One is a matter of basic physics. A rotating pizza stone only leads to even heat around the pizza if you land your pie successfully in the middle of the stone. Land your pizza wrong, and you'll still have to adjust it to re-center it. (Note you'll need to wait to do this until your dough cooks enough on the bottom that you can actually lift it.)

Mostly this has not been a problem. But mistakes happen, and rotating stones aren't a foolproof recipe for even cooks. At least once, I mounted the stone just a little askew and didn't notice until I had already heated up the oven—and this was just enough to offer friction while it turned, causing rotation to stall with my pizza on top. A preventable, but possible, user error.

These are small complaints when lined up against the convenience of not having to futz with a turning peel. And with that rotating stone, All-Clad may have managed to carve out a new niche in backyard pizza—or at least, a new feature to catch up to.

There's plenty of uncertainty to go around this year, including a global trade war, shifting policy priorities, and an economy that's starting to stumble. Breakthrough Energy, a climate tech organization founded by Bill Gates, has also been shifting in response. 

The group always placed long bets, though it appears to be reappraising some of them. Its policy team was scrapped in March, for example, and it didn't continue funding a publication that covered the climate tech world. Still, its investments in startups continue, as does its longest bet, a fellowship program for budding entrepreneurs.

Breakthrough Energy Fellows, as the program is called, is announcing a new cohort today, TechCrunch exclusively learned. It consists of 45 fellows at 22 different startups, and its makeup reveals how the program is evolving both in response to its own data and to global uncertainty.

“It's the most global [cohort] that we've had to date. Fifty percent of the teams are based outside of the U.S.,” Ashley Grosh, vice president at Breakthrough Energy, told TechCrunch.

Grosh and her colleagues had to sift through around 1,500 applications and referrals, making the program more selective than the world's top universities. Eleven teams are based in the U.S., six are in Asia, and the remainder are in Canada, Germany, the U.K., and South Africa.

Part of the international focus was driven by a new hub for the fellowship program in Singapore, which the organization opened in August 2024 with Temasek, the country's investment fund, and Enterprise Singapore, a government agency. 

But it's also a recognition that climate change, being a global problem, will require solutions from around the world. 

“What are local needs, right? What are the local challenges?” Grosh said. By way of example, she points to the fact that several cohort members are working on hydrogen. 

In Asia, “there's a lot of interest in the hydrogen economy,” Grosh noted. Circularity, or recycling materials back to their original form, or better, is also a priority for the region, given its role as a global factory and all the waste that entails.

The new cohort also has startups working on critical minerals, agriculture, and grid modernization.

Beyond its more global focus, the Breakthrough Energy Fellows program has also shifted its curriculum. Based on observations and feedback from previous cohorts, it is encouraging the new group to think early and often about the economics of the technology they're developing. Using a framework called techno-economic analysis, they work with “business fellows” — often entrepreneurs with relevant experience — to determine whether and where their idea can find product-market fit. If not, they'll be nudged to pivot.

“We were seeing a lot of companies come in thinking that they're going to do one thing, and then they pivot,” Grosh said. “They're more venture bankable once we've helped them through that pivot and validated it.”

Grosh said that nearly all of the teams from the previous four cohorts have raised follow-on funding, and one, Holocene, has already exited. “That's a huge measure of success for us,” she said.

For many people, the biggest frustration with traditional desktops and bulky laptops is the trade-off between power and space: You want something fast, reliable, and capable of handling both work and entertainment, but you don't want a noisy tower hogging your desk or a laptop that feels limited once plugged in at home.

That's exactly where a mini PC comes to the rescue: compact enough to fit in your hand, yet powerful enough to replace most desktops. And right now, one of the strongest performers in this category has just hit an all-time low price on Amazon. The Geekom Mini PC AX8 Max is available today for $528, down from its usual $749, which makes this one of the most compelling desktop deals you'll see this season.

See at Amazon

What makes this price drop so impressive is the kind of hardware you're actually getting here. Inside this tiny box sits an AMD Ryzen 7 8745HS processor that is capable of speeds up to 4.9GHz. Paired with onboard Radeon 780M graphics, this computer is surprisingly able for casual gaming and streaming at high resolution. You can connect it to newer games and still keep the device to be almost silent because of efficient thermal management.

Storage and memory are often the first bottlenecks people face with compact PCs, but the AX8 Max pushes well past those limitations. It comes equipped with 32GB of DDR5 RAM running at 5.6GHz, which means smoother switching between apps and plenty of breathing room for memory-hungry software like Photoshop or large spreadsheets.

For storage, you're getting a speedy 1TB PCIe SSD. That not only gives you ample space for your files but it also gives you quick boot times, effectively zero-load app start times, and fewer moments of waiting around compared to older SATA drives. If you've ever been frustrated by sluggish startups and laggy programs, this is the kind of performance kick that makes a real difference in your daily workflow.

What's more, you'll enjoy dual 2.5G LAN ports or higher-speed and more secure wired Internet access than the standard gigabit Ethernet—ultra handy if you're sharing files across a network or need unbroken low-latency performance for online gaming. Wireless-wise, you can count on being able to take advantage of advanced network standards such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to make the experience smooth with peripherals and streaming devices. Then there's the expandability: two USB4 ports with Power Delivery capabilities, for the newer monitors, docking stations, or external graphics processing units. Add support for up to four displays simultaneously, including a jaw-dropping 8K resolution output, and this small machine is now shaping like a powerhouse workstation.

Priced this low, such a bargain is difficult to find, and at $528 this model has never been more affordable on Amazon.

The PowerShell script should work with any version of Windows 11.

NTDEV has introduced the Nano11 Builder for Windows 11. This is a tool that allows Windows 11 testers and tinkerers to pare down Microsoft's latest OS into the bare minimum. With this new release, the developer has significantly pushed the boundaries of their prior Tiny11 releases.

Nano11's extreme pruning of the official installer disk image from Microsoft produces a new ISO “up to 3.5 times smaller” than the original. The example Windows 11 standard ISO shown in the Nano11 demo was 7.04GB, but after the PowerShell script had done its stuff, you can end up with a 2.29GB ISO.

Furthermore, the completed Windows 11 install can scrape in as low as 2.8GB if you use Windows 11 LTSC as the source ISO.

 




Before we talk anymore about Nano11, please be warned that it is described as “an extreme experimental script designed for creating a quick and dirty development testbed.” It could also be useful for Windows 11 VM (virtual machine) tests, suggests its developer. But it isn't designed for installing a compact Windows 11 for your daily workhorse.

In the video above, NTDEV explains the process of creating a Nano11-pruned Windows 11 ISO. Then it demonstrates it installed on a virtual machine using the VMware Workstation app. In this app, the intrepid developer sets aside a meager 20GB virtual disk for the installation; other settings seem to be left at their defaults. The installation moves pretty quickly, but we think the video is also sped up a little to reduce viewer tedium.

At around 8m 34s into the video, there's a demo of the kind of Windows 11 you end up with after its Nano11 processing. In the words of the script developer, Nano11 Builder strips out “fluff like Windows Hello packages, unnecessary drivers, .NET precompiled assembly, IME components, wallpapers and more.” The Start Menu seems so bare…

Some of the social media postings suggest that, when following in NTDEV's Nano11 footsteps, you will end up with as little as a 2.8GB Windows 11 install footprint. However, this will depend on the 'flavor' of Windows 11 you start with, and there is also a little bit more work to be done to achieve the minimum size.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

After installation, the example Nano11 install actually uses up 11.0GB of the 20GB virtual disk in the VM. It is only after NTDEV runs the 'Compact' command on the C: drive using LZX compression and then deletes the virtual memory page file that we see the installation reduced to around the 3.2GB level.

The nano11 script used on a Win11 LTSC image leads to an even better result! This will be perfect for when you need an ISO that can be installed in like 5 minutes and without any (and I mean it) fluff https://t.co/iJXGKahIx4 pic.twitter.com/UVnsS6MlgGSeptember 9, 2025

When starting with the Windows 11 LTSC ISO as the source, NTDEV actually managed to end up with just a 2.8GB install, as shared in a post on X, and embedded above.

Never heard of Status Audio? I don't blame you. The New York City–based company has been operating under the radar ever since founder James Bertuzzi launched its first product, the wired CB-1 headphones, in 2016.

Several wireless headphones followed, and Status eventually created two wireless earbuds, the Between Pro ($169) in 2021 and Between 3ANC ($249) in 2023. They were both well received and proved popular with buyers, perhaps helped by their quirky yet super-comfy square shape.

Still, many reviewers—myself included—noted that they seemed to lack features like advanced codecs, wear sensors, and customizable controls that came standard on similarly priced alternatives from the big brands. The bigger issue, however, was that the Between 3ANC's noise canceling and sound quality fell short.

Bertuzzi and his team were obviously taking notes. The company's third-gen earbuds, the $299 Status Pro X, just launched, and they're a major leap over their predecessors. In fact, after spending three weeks with them, I think Status has created an excellent alternative to flagship wireless earbuds from Bose, Sony, and Apple.

Design-wise, the Pro X retain the same basic shape as the company's previous models. An ergonomic in-ear module is connected to a chunky, rectangular stem. In a world of glossy white stems, the Pro X's matte black with its slash of chrome stands out. I think it looks sharp and sophisticated.

The charging case is about the same size as many of its closest competitors. It's well built, with a sturdy hinge and a strong magnetic latch. Charging can be done wirelessly or wired via USB-C, and Status includes a short cable in the box (though take note if you've got an older computer or charger, as it's USB-C to USB-C).

The Pro X buds themselves look sleeker than both the Between Pro and Between 3ANC; the stem portion now sits much closer to your ear, and Status has nixed the silicone “fitwing” sleeves. If you've had luck with the AirPods Pro or any other stem-based buds with silicone ear tips, I think you'll like the fit.

That said, the elimination of the previous generation's “fitwings” does impact stability. With less skin-to-silicone contact, the Pro X don't have the same rock-solid feel as the Between 3ANC. Unless you're relentlessly pounding the pavement, it shouldn't be an issue. I was a bit surprised to see that there are only three sizes of ear tips in the box, including the preinstalled mediums. More and more companies are shipping four sizes these days, but it's not a deal breaker. With an IP55 rating for dust and water resistance, they should have no problem with a bit of sweat or rain—just be sure to wipe them down before putting them back in the case.

Status' chunky design makes it easy to reposition the buds without accidentally triggering a control. When you do want to tap, the broad outer surface gives a generous target for your finger. The Pro X includes an improved version of the physical button that sits atop those rectangular stems. This one is slightly easier to press, thanks to its gently rounded profile.

I don't entirely understand Status' thinking here. On the one hand, it makes a lot of sense to offer people a choice of physical and touch controls. People not only have preferences for one or the other, but there are also times when only a proper button will do (e.g., gloved hands). Then again, you can only customize the touch controls via the Status Hub app, and the buttons are frustratingly hard-coded to only serve three functions: ANC mode switching, voice assistant access, and power off/on. In an ideal world, you could assign any function to any control/gesture combo. The addition of wear sensors—one of the omissions that made the Between 3ANC harder to recommend—is a welcome change, and they work well for playing and pausing music.

Pairing the Pro X is a snap on Android thanks to Google Fast Pair, and only two taps harder on an iPhone. In my time with these buds, the connection remained very reliable. With Bluetooth multipoint, you can connect two devices simultaneously, and switching between them is fast and seamless. You can't see the list of previously paired (and simultaneously paired) devices in the app, but that's a minor nitpick.

Status Audio Pro X

The Pro X don't support Bluetooth Auracast at the moment, but Status tells me it's on the road map and should be enabled with a future firmware update later this year. When that happens, Status says you'll be able to use the app to find and listen to Auracast broadcasts. Several Auracast-compatible wireless earbuds I've tested recently rely on a phone's operating system to provide the needed interface, which is a real problem for iPhone owners, as Apple has yet to embrace LE Audio or Auracast technologies.

Active noise canceling (ANC) on the Pro X is a major win for Status. It's sensational, with a performance that comes so close to Apple's AirPods Pro 2 ($249) and Bose's QuietComfort Ultra ($299), it's hard to quantify the differences. Whether out and about on busy streets or dealing with the drone of machinery or aircraft cabin noise, you're treated to a quiet and calm environment. However, if you're already in a quiet location, you may notice that ANC mode produces a low-level background hiss when you're not listening to anything. I couldn't hear it all when music was playing, even as low as 20 percent, so it's not a deal breaker for me, but if you want a perfect hush even when there's already a perfect hush, you may want to look elsewhere.

Ambient (transparency) mode is also excellent. Status offers four ambient modes in its companion app: Low, Medium, High, and Super. I used High most of the time, as it felt most natural to me, but I also appreciated Super mode, which acted as a slight hearing enhancement for voices. It's still not as perfect as the AirPods Pro 2 when it comes to the sound of your voice, but then again, I've never tested a set of earbuds that could match the AirPods' transparency.

Best of all, switching between ANC and Ambient is fast, and you don't need to toggle through the available off mode to do so. There's also an anti-wind-noise mode, which I needed when using ANC in even a light breeze. Unfortunately, there's currently no way to trigger this mode using the buttons or touch controls; you'll need to open the app.

When it comes to flagship wireless earbuds from the biggest brands (think Apple, Bose, Sony, Sennheiser, and Technics), they all have one thing in common: a single dynamic driver does all of the work. This isn't necessarily a bad thing—single-driver earbuds can sound fantastic—but it's an approach that puts all of the acoustic eggs in one basket.

Status Audio Pro X

Rating: 9/10

All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.

The Pro X, like the Between 3ANC before them, use multiple drivers: a dynamic unit for the lowest frequencies paired with a dual set of Knowles balanced armatures for the upper-mids and highs. Just like in a tower speaker that has a woofer, a midrange, and a tweeter, multi-driver earbuds divide and conquer by sending specific frequencies to a driver that's been tuned to handle them.

Out of the box, the earbuds are set to Status Signature—the Pro X's default tuning. It's a nicely balanced EQ that boosts neither highs nor lows, yet still possesses a warm tone. There's effortless detail in the midrange, and the highs have excellent clarity. Bass is tightly controlled; even when pushing the Pro X to 95 percent volume, Billie Eilish's bass-tastic “Bad Guy” sounded perfect, with no discernible distortion.

Switching to the Knowles Preferred preset gives a big bump to the upper mids and highs to show off what those balanced armatures can do. Normally, this kind of tuning doesn't do it for me, but on the Pro X, I was impressed by how enjoyable it was. If you've found yourself drawn to Bose's high-energy sound signature in the past, this preset gets you very close.

If you can't find your favorite balance from among the five available presets, you can roll your own. In fact, one of the best features is creating custom EQ presets by starting with an existing one. I goosed Status Signature's low end just a tad and got exactly the mix I wanted. On that note, I have to give Status props for its app; it's super clean and very easy to use.

The soundstage isn't especially wide—I'd place its extremities about 3 to 6 inches outside my head—but it's got excellent precision. Individual elements stand out from each other so clearly that you can mentally point at the various musicians playing in front of you. A jazz classic like Dave Brubeck's “Take Five” benefits a lot from the Pro X's clear separation of sounds, letting you appreciate each instrument in its own space.

I did most of my listening on an iPhone 16, but it's worth noting that the Pro X support Sony's high-quality LDAC Bluetooth codec. If you're on Android, make sure you've got it enabled for an even smoother, more refined performance.

I compared the Pro X with Sony's WF-1000XM5, Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, Sennheiser's Momentum True Wireless 4, and Technics' EAH-Z100. The Status Pro X more than held their own on sound quality. I personally still prefer the XM5's sound signature, thanks to its more resonant bass response, but that's more about my taste than any shortcomings of the Pro X—they're excellent.

Phone calls on the Pro X will keep your voice very clear, with an impressively natural tone—that is, as long as you're in a relatively quiet environment. The moment things get noisier (think loud traffic, construction), the algorithm struggles to keep your voice from becoming compressed. Your callers, on the other hand, will likely think you're just walking through an area of bad reception: Status' VoiceLoom AI does an admirable job of canceling out those intrusive noises. With either transparency mode (or the optional sidetone mode), you'll hear your voice clearly too, though you may need to experiment to find the best combo.

Status pegs the Pro X's battery life at eight hours per charge, with 24 hours total when you include the case's capacity. If you turn ANC off, you may get up to 9.5 hours per charge. That's on the lower side of what you can expect from a set of wireless earbuds, especially when you consider that these numbers are based on 50 percent volume and can drop precipitously when LDAC is used. LDAC plus ANC resulted in just five hours of continuous play time, according to Status' own testing. Is it a deal breaker? No, or at least, not for most folks.

Given the Pro X's many strengths and comprehensive feature set, I think they easily justify their $299 asking price. And if you get in on Status' preorder period, which ends September 16, you can save yourself $50. At $249, they're a steal.

Ever since Apple started to develop its own smartphone processors, it has consistently offered the fastest system-on-chips for handsets, and more recently, these SoCs have even challenged CPUs for PCs when it comes to benchmark scores. The new six-core Apple A19 Pro does just that: it beats its predecessor, it leaves no chances for its arch-rival Snapdragon 8 Elite, and even conquers desktop-grade CPUs in the single-thread Geekbench 6 benchmark. In addition, the processor seems to pack the highest-performing smartphone GPU, offering performance comparable to that of GPUs for client PCs and tablets.

The latest A19 Pro smartphone CPU from Apple scores 3,895 points in single-thread Geekbench 6 tests, outpacing its predecessor by 11% and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite by 36%. In addition, the new chip leaves behind all stock processors for client devices, including Apple's own M4 (by 5.3%) and AMD's mighty Ryzen 9 9950X (by 11.8%). Given Apple's focus on performance efficiency, it is not surprising that the new SoC beats everything in single-thread workloads.

The new A19 Pro application processor also scores 9,746 points in the multi-thread Geekbench 6 test, which is 12% higher compared to A18 Pro. However, the smartphone SoC still cannot beat CPUs for desktops and notebooks in multi-thread workloads, which is not surprising.

While an 11% - 12% generation-to-generation performance increase looks fairly solid, it is lower compared to the improvements of the A18 Pro compared to the A17 Pro (circa 18%).

Apple's A19 Pro SoC features two high-performance cores operating at up to 4.26 GHz (+6.5%) and featuring improved branch prediction (higher performance in branch-heavy workloads and better power efficiency) and increased front-end bandwidth (which points to higher instructions-per-cycle, but does not indicate how many instructions the core can decode per cycle) as well as four energy-efficient cores that now boast with a 50% larger last level cache compared to the predecessor.

The A19 Pro processor is made by TSMC on its N3P fabrication process, which is an optical shrink of N3E that enables a 4% higher transistor density as well as a 5% performance increase at the same power or a 5% - 10% power consumption reduction at the same frequency compared to N3E.

Given the capabilities of the fabrication process, a 6.5% clock speed boost looks quite solid. The CPU also has some microarchitectural improvements, so its performance advantages over its predecessor go beyond the frequency improvement. However, given the fact that Apple uses a vapor chamber cooling system and an aluminum unibody chassis for its iPhone 19 Pro, it is surprising that the company did not increase CPU clocks more significantly to get higher peak performance. Perhaps the company decided to focus on workloads that are branch-heavy and/or benefit from higher IPC more than from sole frequency; it looks like these enhancements do not significantly improve performance in Geekbench 6.

At the presentation of its A19 Pro, Apple did not reveal anything about improvements to its GPU, but said that it still has six clusters. Based on Geekbench 6 results published so far, the A19 Pro GPU is a whopping 37% faster than its predecessor. The GPU scores 45,657 points, which is comparable to the GPU performance of M2 or M3 in iPad Air. It is also comparable to the performance of AMD's Radeon 890M integrated GPU.

Thicc Q80 Trio owners should stop using the liquid cooler and uninstall it ASAP.

Hyte's Thicc Q80 Trio, introduced in January of this year, is among the more visually appealing AIO 360mm liquid coolers available on the market. Unfortunately, Hyte has identified a manufacturing defect that causes the coolant to leak; therefore, Hyte has recommended that all owners cease using the cooler and contact the company or their reseller for assistance.

Following the launch of the liquid cooler, Hyte says it received numerous reports from buyers indicating that certain units were leaking and causing staining of the packaging with coolant. The company responded promptly by securing the affected units and dispatching them to the manufacturer for failure analysis.

According to the OEM's report, "a fragile internal component" inside the Thicc Q80 Trio is the culprit. Although the report does not specify the exact nature of the component, the manufacturer believes it is vulnerable to damage during transportation, which explains why the cooler is leaking even before installation into a case. Nevertheless, it is a critical component as it significantly influences the proper functioning of the cooler or may ultimately lead to its failure.

The unspecified component is located within the cooler, making it inaccessible for the user to observe whether it's leaking or not. Hyte has assured its customer base that this issue is isolated and exclusively pertains to the Thicc Q80 Trio. Earlier models, such as the Thicc Q60, remain unaffected as the two coolers do not share the same design.

Hyte is uncertain how many of the shipped units are affected. Therefore, to be on the safe side, the company recommends that all Thicc Q80 Trio owners stop using the liquid cooler and uninstall it from their system as soon as possible.

Hyte has already informed its network of distributors and resellers to cease the sale of the Thicc Q80 Trio. Concerning returns, customers who purchased the liquid cooler directly from Hyte will be issued full refunds and will receive additional instructions regarding the proper disposal of the unit. Furthermore, Hyte will engage with authorized resellers to contact end-users who have acquired the Thicc Q80 Trio and provide them with appropriate guidance on subsequent actions.

The risks of liquid coolers leaking are, naturally, unavoidable. Although such instances are relatively infrequent, they are nonetheless possible. A Google search will likely yield numerous user reports of leaks, even from prominent brands such as Corsair, Cooler Master, or Thermaltake.

Minutes after right-wing activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot while speaking at an event in Utah on Wednesday, far-right influencers and extremist communities lit up social media with calls for violence against the left.

Kirk, the cofounder of the conservative youth organizing group Turning Point USA, was shot and killed while taking questions at a TPUSA event held at Utah Valley University. Law enforcement officials said late afternoon Wednesday that a “person of interest” was in custody, but that individual was later released. No motive has yet been reported by authorities.

Despite this, many far-right influencers and Republican officials immediately blamed the left for carrying out the shooting. In some extremist groups, members called for civil war and violent retribution. “This is a war, this is a war, this is a war,” said Alex Jones, the influencer and school-shooting conspiracy theorist, during a livestream on his Infowars channel.

“For years those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals,” said President Donald Trump in a taped address posted to his Truth Social account. “This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in the country today.”

Oath Keeper founder Stewart Rhodes, who had his sentence for seditious conspiracy with regards to the January 6 Capitol riot commuted by Trump earlier this year, announced on Infowars that it was time to restart his militia group in order to provide public protection for figures like Kirk.

“I'm going to be rebuilding the Oath Keepers, and we will be doing protection again,” said Rhodes. “If my security team had been at that event, if they had been up there on the high point, looking for potential threats, they would have saved Charlie Kirk from being shot.”

Rhodes then called on Trump to “do what's right, what's necessary” and “invoke the Insurrection Act” in the wake of the shooting. “You should declare the left in this country is in obvious open rebellion against the law of the United States. They're committing insurrection, they're aiding and abetting an invasion, and they're blocking the execution of federal law,” Rhodes said.

More mainstream right-wing commentators and lawmakers have also joined in the rush to blame the left and call for action.

Ed Martin, the US pardon attorney and former acting US attorney for DC, wrote on X: “For it is written, ‘Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,' says the Lord,” citing Romans 12:19.

Elon Musk, the X owner and former figurehead of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), posted: “The Left is the party of murder.” He then quoted a post blaming “the left-wing mainstream media, as well as figures like Gavin Newsom” for radicalizing people against right-wing figures like Kirk. “Exactly,” Musk wrote.

Katie Miller, who worked closely with Musk at DOGE and is the wife of Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, wrote on X that even liberals condemning the violence “had blood on their hands.”

“You could be next,” influencer and unofficial Trump adviser Laura Loomer posted on X. “The Left are terrorists.”

Christopher Rufo, a conservative activist who popularized the demonization of critical race theory, suggested in a post on X that the “radical left” was responsible for the shooting, and urged the US government “to infiltrate, disrupt, arrest, and incarcerate all of those who are responsible for this chaos.”

Republican representative Derrick Van Orden from Wisconsin also blamed the shooting on “leftwing political violence” and warned on X that “whoever does not condemn this is part of the problem. The gloves are off.”

On the floor of the House, after Democrats and Republicans observed a “moment of prayer,” led by House speaker Mike Johnson, for Charlie Kirk and his family, representative Lauren Boebert called for a spoken prayer. Some Democrats said no, and referenced the school shooting in Colorado that also occurred Wednesday. Shouting broke out, and Republican representative Anna Paulina Luna yelled across the aisle, “Y'all caused this.” One Democrat, according to The New York Times, responded, “Pass some gun laws!”

On X, Luna continued to blame the left: “EVERY DAMN ONE OF YOU WHO CALLED US FASCISTS DID THIS. You were too busy doping up kids, cutting off their genitals, inciting racial violence by supporting orgs that exploit minorities, protecting criminals, and stirring hate. YOU ARE THE HATE you claim to fight. Your words caused this. Your hate caused this.” Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene also posted about Kirk's death, calling on people to “rise up and end this.”

Blake Masters, a twice-failed US congressional candidate once backed by Palantir cofounder Peter Thiel and endorsed by Trump, called for RICO investigations into nongovernmental organizations as a result of the shooting.

“Left-wing violence is out of control, and it's not random,” Masters posted on X. “Either we destroy the NGO/donor patronage network that enables and foments it, or it will destroy us.”

Masters was quoting a post from right-wing podcaster and conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich, who blamed the shooting on the left. “Congressional hearings now,” Cernovich posted on X. “Every billionaire funding far left wing extremism. Soros, Bill Gates, Reid Hoffman. Massive RICO investigations now.”

Chaya Raichik, who operates the anti-LGBTQ account Libs of TikTok, simply wrote: “THIS IS WAR.”

On fringe platforms like Trump's own Truth Social and The Donald, the rabidly pro-Trump message board that was responsible for some of the planning of the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, numerous users echoed Jones' comments about war.

“War is coming,” one user of The Donald wrote on a thread dedicated to Kirk's shooting. “War is here,” another responded.

Another user of The Donald wrote in the same thread: “Civil War is coming … this will give the left the blowback they've been begging white people for so they can play the victim and justify white genocide.”

In other threads, users on the same platform linked Kirk's shooting to other attacks on conservative figures. “These are looking like civil war times,” the user wrote. “They fired the first shot Ashli Babbitt, the second, Donald Trump, third Trump and fourth Charlie Kirk shot. Our side hasn't fired a bullet.” Babbitt was shot by a police officer while inside the Capitol during the January 6 riots; the man who allegedly attempted to assassinate Trump in July of last year had no clear political motive.

Even some of Kirk's detractors on the far right, who saw him as not extreme enough, framed his death as a potential recruiting tool.

"In life Charlie Kirk was our enemy because he did whatever he could to undermine White collectivism,” wrote Christopher Pohlhaus, the neo-Nazi leader of the white supremacist group Blood Tribe. “In death he is a martyr because he was killed in a political climate in which he was seen as one of us despite the fact that he was not.”

“We hope this is a lesson learned for the remaining moderates out there,” wrote the neo-Nazi group American Futurist on its Telegram page. “We hope any people who are not willing to commit realize the reality of our situation before they end up like Charlie. You will be an evil racist Nazi no matter who you are. You are their enemy."

For extremist researchers who closely track these groups, the immediate and unified response to the death of Kirk is particularly worrying.

“Rufo calling for arrests of all those who are responsible for this chaos; Cernovich and Blake Masters calling for RICO-style crackdowns against Dem donors; a whole lot of everyday people declaring gloves off.” says Jeff Sharlet, author of The Undertow: Scenes from a Slow Civil War. “99.9 percent of those are just spouting off. But today, if anything, teaches us the damage that 0.1 percent can do.”

A personal letter apparently written by former Microsoft tech leader Nathan Myhrvold was included in Jeffrey Epstein's 50th birthday book, made public this week by the House Oversight Committee.

Myhrvold, who joined Microsoft in 1986 and served as the company's first chief technology officer, is also listed as a “friend” in the book, a copy of which was provided by the Epstein estate as part of an investigation into the late financier and convicted sex offender.

“Mr. Myhrvold knew him from TED conferences and as a donor to basic scientific research,” a spokesperson for Myhrvold said in a statement to GeekWire. “He regrets that he ever met him.”

The one-page letter, signed “Nathan,” is addressed to “Jeffery,” a misspelling of Epstein's first name. 

“I have agonized long and hard about what to write for your birthday,” the letter begins, describing one abandoned version as “a highly philosophical take on personal perception,” due to Epstein's status as “one of the few people who has influenced how I parse and understand the world.” 

Another version, it adds, was “silly and salacious, since your approach to life has so much of each of these things.”

The letter continues, “A few years ago somebody at a party asked me ‘Does Jeffrey Epstein manage your money?'. I replied ‘No, but he advises me on lifestyle'. The guys eyes bugged out of his head and he said ‘REALLY?'

“Alas I am ill prepared to comment on your lifestyle in any detail, since I am (sadly) so far behind that it would be talking about things I know little of!”

Following the letter in the book are a series of crude wildlife photos, including animals mating, which the letter describes as “a few photos that I took on my recent trip to Africa,” which “seemed more appropriate than anything I could put in words.”

Myhrvold is an accomplished photographer whose next book, “Natural Wonders,” is scheduled to be published by National Geographic in October. 

The Wall Street Journal initially reported on the birthday book in July, and cited Myhrvold's letter in a separate story later that month. 

After a 14-year tenure at Microsoft, which included working directly for Bill Gates, Myhrvold went on to launch Bellevue, Wash.-based Intellectual Ventures. He is also vice chairman of TerraPower, the nuclear power venture where Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, is chairman. 

Gates reportedly met Epstein in 2011 — after Epstein was convicted of sex crimes — and had several future meetings, according to a 2019 story from the New York Times. Gates later said those meetings were a “mistake.”

Epstein's network of high-powered friends has come under scrutiny following his death in 2019. The birthday book, reportedly signed by Epstein's associate Ghislaine Maxwell in 2003, also includes a letter bearing the apparent signature of President Donald Trump, which he has denied writing.

Researchers at the University of Oulu's Research Unit of Clinical Medicine and Oulu Business School have examined how symptoms of adolescent ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) are related to adult income.

The study found that the symptoms are not directly linked to income levels in adulthood. Instead, the impact is seen indirectly, through education and other psychiatric disorders.

The effect was strongest among individuals with symptoms of both ADHD and ODD: their incomes were on average 25 per cent lower through the pathway of education and 18 per cent lower through other psychiatric disorders.

The study used data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986, which includes nearly 9,500 participants. When they were 16 years old, their parents assessed their ADHD and ODD symptoms using a questionnaire. In addition, national registers were used to obtain information on education, annual income, psychiatric disorders and background factors.

ODD is a common comorbid disorder of ADHD, occurring in about 30 per cent of those diagnosed with ADHD. The large-scale data also made it possible to examine the independent effects of ODD symptoms – an area where research has previously been scarce and partly contradictory.

According to Sampo Seppä, the lead author of the study, the results are encouraging: “Symptoms of adolescent ADHD and ODD were not in themselves associated with lower income levels in adulthood,” Seppä explains.

However, his earlier research has shown that ADHD and ODD symptoms impair school performance during adolescence, lower educational attainment in adulthood, and increase the risk of unemployment and sickness absence.

These new findings add to our understanding of why young people with ADHD tend to fare worse in working life on average. The results may help reduce the stigma associated with ADHD and strengthen the belief that with the right support, young people can succeed in working life just like anyone else.”

Sampo Seppä, lead author of the study

The study also highlights the importance of preventive services.

“I hope this research will help to increase appreciation of investments in education and mental health services, so that the consequences of neurodevelopmental disorders can be reduced at the population level,” Seppä concludes.

In an Italian study involving more than 900 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), dupilumab reduced NP scores and alleviated nasal obstruction at 2 years. Over 91% of patients had a good-to-excellent response, with approximately 19% successfully extending treatment intervals to every 4 weeks.

“[The study] results contribute to the growing evidence supporting dupilumab's role as a cornerstone therapy for severe CRSwNP,” the authors wrote. 

Eugenio De Corso, MD, PhD, with A. Gemelli University Hospital Foundation IRCCS, Rome, Italy, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on August 30, 2025 in Allergy.

The absence of a control group, retrospective data collection, and inclusion of only Italian participants may have limited generalizability. The proposed criteria for disease control and remission were not validated or standardized through consensus-based guidelines.

Several authors reported receiving lecture fees from and participating in expert board meetings for various pharmaceutical companies.

An unusual therapy developed at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) could change the way the world fights influenza, one of the deadliest infectious diseases. In a new study in Science Advances, researchers report that a cocktail of antibodies protected mice-including those with weakened immune systems-from nearly every strain of influenza tested, including avian and swine variants that pose pandemic threats.

Unlike current FDA-approved flu treatments, which target viral enzymes and can quickly become useless as the virus mutates, this therapy did not allow viral escape, even after a month of repeated exposure in animals. That difference could prove crucial in future outbreaks, when survival often depends on how quickly and effectively doctors can deploy treatments and vaccine development will take about six months.

This is the first time we've seen such broad and lasting protection against flu in a living system. Even when we gave the therapy days after infection most of the treated mice survived."

Silke Paust, immunologist at JAX and senior author of the study

The insights challenge a long-held belief that for antibodies to be useful as a therapy against viruses they must be "neutralizing" antibodies that bind directly to viruses and block them from infecting cells. Instead, the team engineered "non-neutralizing" antibodies, which don't prevent infection but tag infected lung cells and recruit the body's immune system to clear the infection. This new approach could reshape how scientists design treatments for other viruses.

"The majority of antibodies our bodies make are non-neutralizing, but medicine has largely ignored them," Paust explained. "We show they can be lifesaving. Even with lethal strains like H5 and H7 avian flu, this therapy saved lives long after infection had taken hold."

The team focused on a small, highly conserved region of the influenza A virus's Matrix Protein 2, called M2e. This part of the virus is essential for its life cycle and remains nearly unchanged across infected cells in all flu strains, including human, avian, and swine variants.

The therapy did not lead to viral resistance even after repeated exposure, and sequencing confirmed no mutations in the virus's M2 region after 24 days of treatment. While the team tested the efficacy of the three antibodies individually, the success came from combining them, as this approach reduces the virus' chances of escaping three different antibodies.

"The virus didn't mutate away even when using individual antibodies," Paust said. "But in a flu season with millions of people taking this therapy, I would be much more confident that we can prevent escape from the therapy if we use the cocktail."

Paust and her team found that the antibodies were effective at low doses, both before and after influenza infection. The cocktail significantly reduced disease severity and viral load in lungs, and improved survival rates in both healthy and immunocompromised mice.

When testing H7N9, a type of bird flu that can be deadly to both animals and people, the team found that just one dose of the treatment reduced the amount of virus in the lungs, even when it was given four days after infection. The reduced viral loads correlated with better survival rates. All mice survived when treated with the antibody cocktail on the first three days after infection, while 70% and 60% survived on days four and five, respectively.

"We can use very low doses, which is also promising because potential therapies could be cheaper and less likely to produce adverse side effects in people," Paust said.

While the results are preliminary, they are promising for a future where patients could have access to stockpiled therapeutics to be deployed rapidly to fight seasonal outbreaks or pandemics. Currently, flu vaccines are updated seasonally because the virus continuously mutates, making immunity to prior strains irrelevant.

"We need something that is off the shelf when we don't necessarily have the time to make a new vaccine if we do have an outbreak or pandemic where lethality is high, so this type of therapy could be readily available for anyone in any situation," Paust said.

The team is working on designing antibodies for clinical trials. The idea is to make a "humanized" antibody with the same specificity to target the M2 protein, but without triggering an immune response against the therapy itself or diminishing its efficacy in humans. The team envisions a future where the cocktail could work as a standalone prophylactic for elderly, immunocompromised, and other high-risk groups, in addition to serving as a therapy for those severely ill with flu.

A study supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) finds that individuals who received medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) while incarcerated were significantly more likely to continue treatment six months after release than those who did not receive MOUD. The study also found that receiving MOUD in jail was associated with a 52% lower risk of fatal opioid overdose, a 24% lower risk of non-fatal opioid overdose, a 56% lower risk of death from any cause, and a 12% lower risk of reincarceration after release. These outcomes underscore the importance of providing MOUD treatment during incarceration. 

Published in The New England Journal of Medicine, the study analyzed data from 6,400 people with probable opioid use disorder who were incarcerated in seven Massachusetts county jails between September 2019 and December 2020. Of these, 42% received MOUD while in jail, while 58% did not. Researchers monitored treatment engagement, opioid overdose, reincarceration, and mortality for all participants for up to six months after release.

"These findings demonstrate the importance of providing medications to treat opioid use disorder in correctional settings," said Nora D. Volkow, M.D., Director of NIDA. "Offering effective opioid treatment to people in jail is a critical step toward addressing the opioid crisis, promoting recovery, saving lives and reducing reincarceration. It's a win-win for public health." 

The opioid epidemic remains a devastating public health challenge in the United States, contributing to more than 80,000 deaths in 2024 alone. People with opioid use disorder are overrepresented in jails compared to the general population. Despite their effectiveness, MOUD is available in only about 13% of U.S. jails and is often restricted to specific groups, such as pregnant women. This limited access contributes to forced withdrawal, increasing the risk of relapse and overdose post-release.

Massachusetts has been especially impacted by the overdose epidemic, with fatal opioid-related overdoses quadrupling over the past two decades. In response, a 2018 state law mandated a four-year pilot program to provide all U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved MOUD-buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone-in five county jails, with two additional jails voluntarily joining the program. The law requires that individuals already receiving treatment for opioid use disorder continue it during detention, begin treatment before release when appropriate, and be connected to community care after release. 

To evaluate the impact of the pilot program, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health partnered with the Massachusetts Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (MassJCOIN) and participating jails to conduct a comprehensive study tracking post-release outcomes. Researchers collected data directly from incarcerated individuals and extracted information from jail administrative and clinical records. These data were integrated with the Massachusetts Public Health Data Warehouse, which links over 35 state databases to track treatment for substance use disorders, incarceration, mortality, and other public health indicators. This linkage enabled a robust analysis of the program's impact on key post-release outcomes.

Treatment in jail was strongly associated with better outcomes after release. Within the first 30 days, 60.2% of those who received MOUD in jail, initiated treatment in the community, compared to only 17.6% of individuals who weren't treated. Half of the group treated in jail stayed on medication for at least 75% of the first 90 days after release, while only 12.3% of the untreated group did the same. Six months after release, 57.5% of those who received treatment in jail continued receiving MOUD, compared to just 22.8% of those who did not. Most people treated in jail received buprenorphine (67.9%) followed by methadone (25.7%) and naltrexone (6.5%). 

The Massachusetts initiative represents a model for how jails can play a vital role in addressing the opioid epidemic in the community."

Peter D. Friedmann, M.D., M.P.H., lead author and addiction medicine physician, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School

Senior author Elizabeth A. Evans, PhD, a public health professor from University of Massachusetts-Amherst added, "Establishing these types of programs in local jails is a powerful and effective strategy for engaging and retaining people in treatment and reducing overdose deaths after release." 

Future research should explore the generalizability of these findings to other correctional systems, as well as how outcomes differ across population subgroups and by the type of medication received. Research to examine which strategies for implementing MOUD in jails are most effective in supporting recovery after release are also needed. 

This research was supported by the Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (JCOIN), a nationwide research program that tests strategies to expand effective treatment, recovery, and related services for individuals with opioid use disorder involved in the criminal justice system. JCOIN is funded by the NIH's National Institute on Drug Abuse as part of the NIH Helping to End Addiction Long-term ® (NIH HEAL Initiative®).

Increased risk for anxiety may begin before birth, shaped by infection or stressful events during pregnancy, according to a new preclinical study from researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine. While scientists have long known that maternal difficulty during pregnancy may raise a child's risk for psychiatric illness, the biological pathways between these prenatal experiences and later mental health have been unclear.

The study, published Sept. 10 in Cell Reports, focuses on a region of the brain called the ventral dentate gyrus (vDG), part of the hippocampus that helps a person assess threats in the environment. The researchers discovered that adversity in the womb configured a small percentage of these brain cells to be overly active when faced with a threatening situation, creating a vulnerability to anxiety.

"Our data reveal prenatal adversity left lasting imprints on the neurons of the vDG linking gestational environment to anxiety-like behavior," said Dr. Miklos Toth, the Arleen B. Rifkind, M.D. Professor in the Department of Pharmacology at Weill Cornell Medicine, who co-led the research. "This mechanism may help explain the persistent stress sensitivity and avoidance seen in some individuals with innate anxiety."

To mimic adverse conditions in the womb, the researchers used a mouse model that develops abnormal immune activity during pregnancy. When tested, their genetically normal offspring grew up to show classic signs of anxiety, such as avoiding open spaces and over-responding to stress. But how does an inflammatory environment in the womb cause lasting changes in the brain that may lead to anxiety?

The team analyzed DNA methylation patterns in individual neurons of the vDG. These chemical tags help control which genes are turned on and off. They also used single-cell RNA sequencing to map the genes that were activated abnormally. These changes are called "epigenetic" because they don't alter the actual genetic code but affect how cells read and use that code.

Surprisingly, the researchers uncovered thousands of sites where DNA methylation was altered, especially in regions that act as "on-off switches" for genes controlling synapses—the connections that allow neurons to communicate. They observed that some neurons were more affected than others.

When the mice were exposed to a threatening environment, the most heavily reprogrammed neurons became hyperactive. These neurons exhibited both altered DNA methylation and abnormal expression of genes related to synaptic function.

"Overall, these epigenetic changes are instructing certain neurons in the vDG to respond differently in adulthood when faced with unsafe environments," explained Dr. Kristen Pleil, associate professor of pharmacology at Weill Cornell Medicine, who co-led this research. "The neurons show too much activity, ultimately contributing to the mice perceiving the environment as more threatening than it actually is."

The researchers then monitored these neurons in real time. In control mice, activity in the vDG remained steady when moving from safe to risky areas of a maze. But in mice exposed to prenatal adversity, activity surged as soon as they started thinking about transitioning from safety into a threatening space. This "ramping up" of activity appears to encode an exaggerated perception of danger, driving avoidance and anxious behavior. "The mice seem to anticipate the danger, so the increased activity of the neurons is not a consequence of going into the threatening environment, but precedes it," Dr. Pleil said.

This study provides one of the clearest mechanistic links yet between prenatal environment, epigenetic change and psychiatric risk, but is only a starting point. The researchers plan to tease out more mechanistic details.

A mouse may have almost 400,000 cells in the vDG, but only a few thousand are impacted during pregnancy. Next, we really want to understand why these certain cells are epigenetically programmed."

Dr. Miklos Toth, the Arleen B. Rifkind, M.D. Professor, Department of Pharmacology, Weill Cornell Medicine

A better understanding of this mechanism may help guide the search for similar epigenetic signatures in people, which could serve as early biomarkers of risk. The specific synapse-related genes that are abnormally programmed in these "primed" neurons may also potentially lead to therapeutic targets.

The findings underscore the importance of maternal health during pregnancy—not just for physical outcomes like birth weight, but also for shaping long-term brain function.

The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is one of the few vaccines proven to prevent cancer-so why have only 61% of teens 13-17 and far lower percentages of younger children received the potentially life-saving shots?

A new project led by University of Maryland communication Professor Xiaoli Nan aims to change those discouraging statistics by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to help parents make informed choices.

Backed by a $2.8 million grant from the National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute, Nan and an interdisciplinary team of researchers are developing a personalized, AI-driven chatbot that tailors health information to parents' specific concerns and communication styles.

This vaccine is safe, effective and prevents several types of cancer, but many parents still hesitate. We're using AI to help meet them where they are and make sure they feel supported in the decision-making process." 

Professor Xiaoli Nan, University of Maryland

The project also includes Cheryl Knott and Min Qi Wang, professors of behavioral and community health in the School of Public Health, Philip Resnik, an MPower Professor with a joint appointment in the Department of Linguistics and the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, and Clement Adebamowo and Shana Ntiri from the School of Medicine at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. 

Recommended for adolescents as early as age 9, the HPV vaccine is widely endorsed by physicians as a safe and lasting defense against cancers of the anus, cervix, throat and other areas. But misinformation, stigma and distrust have slowed its widespread adoption, said Knott, who is also associate director of community outreach and engagement at the University of Maryland Marlene and Stuart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center in Baltimore. 

Part of the stigma comes from the vaccine's link to a sexually transmitted infection. Some parents hear that and wonder if it's too soon, choosing to delay or avoid vaccination altogether.

"The literature shows that this vaccine is underutilized especially in certain groups, for example men, those with less education, and those with less access to health care," Knott said.

While traditional communication tools-like brochures and websites-often fail to address concerns at an individual level, the research team's AI-powered chatbot will use natural language processing to simulate human conversation. But it goes further, tailoring messages to a user's specific beliefs, concerns and communication preferences.

Unlike scripted chatbots that only deliver canned replies-or generative AI models like ChatGPT, which can produce unreliable text-the team's system draws on large language models in a more controlled way. The models help generate a broad set of potential responses, which are then curated and vetted by the team's experts. During live use, the chatbot analyzes what a parent has said and selects the most appropriate reply from that trusted set.

Resnik describes this as a "middle ground" approach: not limited to rigid, prewritten scripts, but also not the "wild west" of open-ended text where "guardrails" have often proven ineffective. "You have curated possibilities," he said, "and at the same time much more flexibility, because the system is analyzing what the person says and adapting in response."

The first phase of the project focuses on refining the chatbot through a user-centered design process and gathering input from parents, health professionals and community members. Once refined, the chatbot will be tested in two randomized controlled trials. The first will be conducted online with a national sample of U.S. parents, comparing the chatbot's impact to a standard CDC pamphlet. The second trial will take place in clinical settings in Baltimore, including at pediatricians' offices. 

Qi Wang said the "tailored, timely and actionable communication" enabled by AI "represents a paradigm shift in public health communication, moving beyond traditional methods to address the specific needs and concerns of parents who have adolescent children." 

Beyond its potential to drive vaccine uptake, the researchers hope to demonstrate how AI can help public health systems respond more quickly, thoughtfully and inclusively-especially in times of crisis. In future pandemics or other fast-moving public health challenges, tools like the chatbot could offer a scalable, adaptable solution for reaching people with timely, personalized guidance, Nan said.

The project "really makes people think about what's possible," she said. "Can we do a better job with public health communication-with speed, scale and empathy? I think the answer is yes."

The university stage, particularly its beginning, is a time of tension and emotional stress for young students-many of whom are under the age of 20. This is a group in which suicidal ideation has increased significantly in recent years, surpassing the general population. Now, a study led by the Hospital del Mar Research Institute has quantified the prevalence of suicidal thoughts among university students and identified the main associated risk factors. The study, part of the World Mental Health International College Student Initiative (WMH-ICS) led by Harvard University in the United States, has been published in the journal Psychiatry Research.

The study included nearly 73,000 university students, most of them in their first year, from 71 universities across 18 countries between 2017 and 2023. Participating countries included Germany, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Spain, France, Kenya, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Romania, South Africa, Sweden, Chile, and China. Students were invited via email to complete a survey designed to assess whether they had ever experienced suicidal thoughts or attempts, as well as whether they had faced adverse life events or had mental health disorders. This is the largest study ever conducted on this topic.

Responses from participants who completed the survey revealed that nearly half (47%) had experienced suicidal thoughts at some point in their lives, 26% had made a suicide plan, and 10% had attempted suicide. In the year prior to completing the survey, 30% reported having suicidal thoughts, 14% had made a plan, and 2.3% had attempted suicide. These rates are significantly higher than those of the general population. However, researchers caution that although these results are consistent with other studies, they may be slightly overestimated due to the self-selection of students with suicidal ideation into the survey.

Exposure to emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect-especially during childhood-is directly linked to suicidal ideation and the progression to planning and attempting suicide."

Dr. Philippe Mortier, researcher in the Health Services Research Group at the Hospital del Mar Research Institute and member of the CIBER in Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP)

"All these factors carry risk-every traumatic event, every mental disorder, without exception, increases the risk of suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts," he adds. The results also highlight the importance of having parents with mental disorders, which can lead to childhood adversity.

Another factor increasing the risk of suicidal thoughts is gender identity. Among transgender students, the risk is significantly higher-they are 2.4 times more likely to experience suicidal ideation and 3.6 times more likely to attempt suicide than other students. Researchers point out that this group is more likely to be exposed to multiple risk factors, including social ones. These conclusions can be extended to the broader LGBTQ+ population. Overall, the strongest predictors of suicidal behavior were emotional abuse, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder.

According to Philippe Mortier, preventing such outcomes requires "increasing resources available to universities to reduce mental health disorders and suicide risk." "We need to invest in strategies and resources to build effective preventive interventions," he explains. In this regard, Dr. Jordi Alonso, coordinator of the Health Services Research Group at the Hospital del Mar Research Institute, Spanish coordinator of the WMH-ICS initiative, and principal investigator at CIBERESP, adds that "effective prevention must take into account the combination of risk factors-such as sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, and the accumulation of childhood disorders-which can create a biosocial feedback loop that increases suicide risk."

Cal tenir en compte que l'adolescència és un període d'alt risc per a l'aparició de pensaments i conductes suïcides, que es poden mantenir fins a l'edat adulta. De fet, un terç dels joves experimenten ideació suïcida abans d'entrar a la universitat i molts casos persisteixen durant aquest període de la seva vida. Tot plegat pot produir un menor rendiment acadèmic i l'abandonament dels estudis universitaris, així com efectes adversos físics i mentals a llarg termini i una baixa qualitat de vida. "Identificar els factors de risc durant aquesta transició crítica és essencial per als esforços de prevenció", coincideixen Mortier i Alonso.

It is important to note that adolescence is a high-risk period for the onset of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, which can persist into adulthood. In fact, one-third of young people experience suicidal ideation before entering university, and many cases continue during this period. This can result in poorer academic performance, dropout, long-term physical and mental health problems, and reduced quality of life. "Identifying risk factors during this critical transition is essential for prevention efforts," conclude Mortier and Alonso.

New research from the University of Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre has found that genes play an active role in shaping the bacteria found in our gut, questioning the idea that gut health is influenced only by diet. 

The gut microbiome is increasingly seen as vital to overall health, with Australia's gut health supplement industry valued at over $400 million in 2024.

After decades of research linking the gut microbiome to almost every chronic disease, it may seem like we're all being held hostage by the bugs that live inside us.

While gut microbes certainly influence everything from diabetes to depression, this study has revealed that our bodies aren't just passive hosts."

Dr. Stewart Masson from the Charles Perkins Centre, first author of the new study in EMBO J

The researchers found that mice with certain genes produced natural peptides – or small proteins – called alpha-defensins, which act as gardeners of the microbiome, shaping which gut bugs thrive and weeding out undesirable bacteria. The mice with alpha-defensins had healthier microbiomes and were much less likely to develop insulin resistance, a key cause of type 2 diabetes and heart disease.

Importantly, alpha-defensin peptides are also found in people, which the researchers believe is highly relevant to human health.

Professor David James, joint Interim Academic Director of the Charles Perkins Centre, said: "Our work suggests that our DNA actively works to shape a healthy gut microbiome, and these microbial-shaping peptides could one day, if harnessed, become a new weapon against obesity and diabetes."

The researchers were originally studying genetic influences of insulin resistance in mice when they noticed that certain mice were less prone to the condition had genes that changed the production of defensin peptides in cells lining the intestine.

"Defensin peptides are present in a wide range of organisms, from plants to mice and humans, and are thought to be the earliest precursor to an immune system," Dr Masson said. "Mice and humans seem to have evolved many defensin genes, each making a different peptide. It is thought that this diversity allows our immune system to fend off a wide range of attackers". 

The researchers found that mice whose genes made more alpha-defensins were healthier than mice who made less.

To test these findings, the researchers then synthesised the defensin peptides in the lab and fed them to mice without the genes. The experiments showed that this protected mice from the negative effects of an unhealthy diet.

"These initial findings are exciting because they show we can potentially use peptides to address chronic diseases from diabetes to obesity to depression – all of which have been linked to the health of our microbiome over decades of research," Dr Masson said.

Critically, while certain genetic strains of mice gained benefit from the defensin peptides, others did not and were, in fact, worse off. 

"This shows the importance of 'personalised medicine', or tailoring treatments to complement the genes of individuals rather than taking a one-size-fits-all approach to medications," Dr Masson said. "We need to establish how different individuals and microbiomes react to the same treatments, whether they be defensin peptides or common medications already in use."

Dr Masson said the team is now looking to expand on the research and explore how it applies to human health.

"We're looking to measure these peptides in humans. In particular, measuring them in the gut and looking at the relationship with metabolic health and the microbiome.

"I'm also interested in defensins beyond diabetes. We know the microbiome is involved in many chronic diseases like cancer; I suspect defensins could play a role in this field."

Professor James said that this illustrates the potential power of precision medicine.

"Our work clearly shows how manipulating the gut microbiome with these peptides benefits some but not others," he said. "This highlights both the potential of precision medicine and the potential dangers of trying to alter our gut microbiome, such as with supplements or even fad diets, before we know more about how our bodies maintain healthy microbiomes unique to each of us. 

"We are at the foothills of precision medicine, and the picture looks promising, but we have a long way to go."

New evidence shows that THC in cannabis can accelerate egg maturation but increase chromosomal errors, reducing healthy embryo development and raising concerns for women undergoing IVF.

In a recent article in the journal Nature Communications, researchers investigated how tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive compound found in cannabis, affects women's fertility. Their findings showed links between THC exposure and outcomes relevant to reproductive health, including a positive association with oocyte nuclear maturation alongside lower embryo euploid rates, chromosome segregation errors, and atypical spindle morphology.

Cannabis use has been rising worldwide, both for medical and recreational purposes, with THC levels in products increasing from about 3% in the 1980s to as high as 30% today. This trend raises public health concerns, especially for reproductive health, since the endocannabinoid system plays a critical role in human reproduction.

While numerous studies have shown that THC negatively impacts male fertility, affecting the methylation, concentration, morphology, and motility of sperm deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), its influence on female reproductive cells remains poorly understood.

Existing research on women has focused mainly on pregnancy outcomes, placental function, and offspring health, leaving a major gap in knowledge about THC's direct effects on the oocyte.

In vitro fertilization (IVF) offers a unique opportunity to study this process, as oocytes are retrieved along with the follicular fluid and surrounding supporting cells. Previous work has shown that THC and its metabolites can reach the ovarian follicle, potentially altering the microenvironment and affecting granulosa cells at the molecular level.

Since oocytes are highly sensitive to environmental exposures and critical for fertility and future generations, understanding how THC affects their maturation and function is essential.

Researchers investigated the impact of THC on oocyte health, gene expression, and chromosome segregation, combining laboratory experiments with clinical data.

They used donated biological materials, including follicular fluid (FF) and immature oocytes, from IVF patients who had provided informed consent. Patients with poor fertility outcomes, advanced age, or THC exposure were excluded to ensure sample quality. THC and its metabolites were measured in FF and serum.

For laboratory experiments, immature oocytes were divided into three groups: control, low-dose THC (reflecting physiological levels), and high-dose THC (based on animal studies). Oocytes were cultured for 24 hours, with maturation and key cellular events monitored using time-lapse imaging.

Some oocytes underwent ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing to identify transcript changes, while others were immunostained to examine spindle structure. Polar body biopsies were also performed for chromosome analysis using whole-genome sequencing.

Data were analyzed with established bioinformatics pipelines and statistical tests, and clinical IVF outcomes were compared using a retrospective matched case-control design. All procedures followed ethical approval and Canadian cannabis regulations.

The researchers measured THC and its metabolites in FF from IVF patients and found that 6% of samples were positive. Most contained the metabolite 11-COOH-THC, while Δ9-THC and 11-OH-THC were often detected together.

Interestingly, 73% of THC-positive patients had not disclosed cannabis use. Concentrations of these metabolites were similar between FF and serum. Statistical analysis revealed that THC metabolite levels were positively correlated with oocyte maturation rates but not with fertilization or blastocyst development.

In laboratory experiments, immature oocytes were cultured with physiologically relevant or higher concentrations of THC. While there was a non-significant trend toward higher maturation, THC exposure did not alter oocyte size, timing of key maturation events, or polar body extrusion.

However, transcriptome sequencing revealed substantial changes in gene expression. Low-dose THC exposure altered 316 genes (predominantly downregulated), while high-dose exposure affected 464 genes (predominantly upregulated), involving pathways related to inflammation, extracellular matrix remodeling, immune signaling, and chromosome segregation. Examples included downregulation of MMP9, a gene involved in extracellular matrix remodeling.

Further analyses revealed that THC exposure increased chromosome segregation errors, with more abnormal spindle structures (92% of high-dose oocytes vs 42% of controls) and an increase in complex aneuploidy (42% of THC-exposed oocytes vs 0% in controls).

Clinically, THC-positive patients had significantly lower embryo euploidy rates and reduced odds of achieving favorable blastulation and euploidy outcomes during IVF. In simple comparisons, there was no significant difference in fertilization or blastocyst rates between THC-positive and matched THC-negative cycles. However, adjusted models indicated lower odds of achieving the prespecified blastulation and euploidy thresholds in the THC-positive group.

This study shows that THC, the main psychoactive compound in cannabis, affects human oocytes by altering maturation, transcript profiles, chromosome segregation, and spindle organization.

While THC appeared to accelerate oocyte maturation, it also disrupted critical molecular pathways, reduced embryo euploidy rates, and increased chromosomal errors, which may lower fertility outcomes. These findings align with some previous animal studies but provide direct evidence in human oocytes, highlighting potential risks for people undergoing IVF.

A major strength of this research is its integrated approach, which combines retrospective clinical data with detailed in vitro experiments and measures THC metabolites directly, rather than relying on self-reports.

However, limitations include the use of immature oocytes from stimulated cycles, a lack of power to examine effects by age, and missing data on cannabis consumption habits or co-exposures.

Future studies should explore dose–response effects, mechanisms of THC action in oocytes, and long-term impacts on embryo development. Clinically, these findings emphasize the importance of counseling patients about potential fertility risks linked to cannabis use.

IntroductionOral Health and Systemic InflammationPathways Linking Periodontal Pathogens to NeurodegenerationEvidence from Research StudiesImplications for Prevention and ManagementChallenges and Knowledge GapsFuture DirectionsConclusionsRelated videoReferencesFurther reading

This article explores how chronic periodontitis may contribute to Alzheimer's disease through systemic inflammation, oral pathogens, and neurodegenerative mechanisms. It highlights prevention, therapeutic strategies, and research directions linking oral health with brain aging.

Periodontitis is often known as 'Gum Disease' and is a very common condition in which the gums and deeper periodontal structures become inflamed. Image Credit: design_cam / Shutterstock

Oral health is increasingly linked to systemic disease and brain aging. Periodontitis (a chronic inflammatory destruction of tooth-supporting tissues) raises systemic inflammatory load through dysbiotic biofilms and host responses. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline with neuroinflammation, amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles.

Converging clinical, epidemiological, and experimental work suggests that periodontal infections may amplify Alzheimer's risk through systemic cytokines, microglial activation, and the potential translocation of oral pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, into the brain. The detection of periodontal bacteria and their products in Alzheimer's cohorts underscores the biological plausibility. Recent narrative and mechanistic reviews indicate that periodontitis is associated with a heightened risk of cognitive decline and dementia, with some reports approaching a ~2-fold elevation in AD risk.1,2,3,6



Representation of diverse systemic diseases and their relationship with periodontitis.2

Periodontitis begins as a dysbiotic plaque biofilm. Persistent plaque triggers chronic inflammation, deepening sulci into periodontal pockets that harbor anaerobes. Keystone pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola release lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and proteases that elevate interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α).3,4

These mediators activate the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) (RANK) ligand-osteoprotegerin (OPG) axis and promote connective-tissue and alveolar-bone loss. Bacteria and toxins enter the blood (transient bacteremia), invade the endothelium, and disseminate, amplifying neuroinflammation relevant to AD. Elevated systemic biomarkers such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) have been reported to strengthen the association between severe periodontitis and lower cognitive performance.2,5



Illustration of the pathogenesis of periodontitis, comparing health with periodontitis. 

Periodontal pathogens can access the brain directly by breaching the blood–brain barrier (BBB) or traveling along cranial nerves. Virulence factors (e.g., gingipains) and outer membrane vesicles from P. gingivalis can affect BBB integrity and activate meningeal and parenchymal immune cells, with potential spread via trigeminal pathways.3,4

Indirectly, chronic systemic inflammation primes resident immune cells. LPS activates Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2/4), driving NF-κB and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. These cascades assemble NLRP3 inflammasomes and complement component 1q (C1q), elevating IL-1β and TNF-α.3,4

These inflammatory signals intersect AD biology: LPS and gingipains promote amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, while outer membrane vesicles and gingipains enhance tau phosphorylation through glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β). Spirochetes such as Treponema denticola and LPS from red-complex bacteria have been linked to tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal apoptosis in experimental systems.3,4

Converging evidence links chronic periodontitis to AD. Large epidemiological cohorts report greater dementia and AD incidence in people with periodontitis, even after accounting for lifestyle factors. Population studies and reviews suggest increased AD risk among individuals with periodontitis and lower cognitive scores in those with severe disease.1,5,6

Experimental work demonstrates biological plausibility: oral infection with Porphyromonas gingivalis accelerates Aβ42 production, triggers neuroinflammation, and causes hippocampal neurotoxicity in animal models. Gingipain inhibitors directed at Kgp/Rgp have been shown preclinically to reduce brain bacterial load, inflammatory responses, and Aβ42 levels, with neuroprotective effects.3,4

Additional periodontal species (e.g., Fusobacterium nucleatum) and endotoxin challenges further amplify neuroinflammation and Aβ accumulation, supporting a mouth-to-brain inflammatory axis.3,4

Clinical and neuropathological findings complement these data. Autopsy studies have detected microbial signatures in AD brains, including Porphyromonas gingivalis. Gingipains, cysteine proteases central to P. gingivalis pathogenicity, have been identified in AD brain tissue.3,4,6

Taken together, population-level associations, mechanistic animal studies, and clinical detection of periodontal pathogens in post-mortem AD tissue triangulate on a coherent model: chronic periodontal infection may contribute to AD pathogenesis. Nonetheless, observational designs, variability in periodontal and cognitive case definitions, and residual confounding mean causality remains under active investigation.1,6

Prioritizing lifelong oral hygiene is a low-cost, high-yield strategy for brain health. Twice-daily brushing with fluoride, daily interdental cleaning, tobacco cessation, and biannual professional cleanings help limit periodontal inflammation throughout the lifespan.

For patients with established periodontitis, early, targeted periodontal therapy, including scaling and root planing, risk-based maintenance every 3–4 months, and short-course adjuncts when indicated, reduces both local and systemic inflammatory loads. Adjunctive strategies under exploration include probiotics, oral microbiota replacement, and host-targeted anti-inflammatory approaches.7

Primary care and neurology clinics should integrate oral health screening into midlife and late-life prevention visits. Ask about bleeding gums or tooth mobility, check for tooth loss, and refer for a comprehensive periodontal examination. Including dental status and inflammatory markers in risk stratification builds shared care pathways between dentists, geriatricians, and memory clinics. In cohorts with severe periodontitis, attention to systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., ALP) may help identify individuals at higher risk.5

For individuals living with dementia, simplify hygiene practices (such as using an electric brush and high-fluoride paste, and caregiver-assisted routines), treat active disease promptly, and maintain frequent reminders. Preserving periodontal health is a practical and modifiable lever for dementia prevention.

Despite growing signals linking periodontal disease and AD, key uncertainties remain. First, most evidence is observational, leaving the direction of effect unresolved: does chronic periodontal disease heighten neuroinflammation and accelerate Aβ pathology, or does prodromal AD impair self-care, worsening oral hygiene (reverse causation)?

Second, human studies vary widely. Definitions of periodontal disease, cognitive endpoints, sampling sites, and microbial assays differ. Many rely on small, clinic-based cohorts vulnerable to selection bias, short follow-up, and inadequate control of confounders such as age, diabetes, smoking, socioeconomic status, and medications.

Third, decisive longitudinal designs are scarce. Field priorities include harmonized periodontal case definitions, adjudicated AD diagnoses supported by biomarkers, serial oral-microbiome and inflammatory profiling, and pragmatic trials testing periodontal therapy across the AD spectrum.1,3,6

Future work should prioritize precision antimicrobials that disrupt periodontal virulence without collapsing the commensal microbiota. Lead candidates include inhibitors of Porphyromonas gingivalis gingipains (lysine-specific Kgp and arginine-specific Rgp), as well as biofilm- or quorum-sensing blockers that reduce pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance.3,7

The parallel development of topical or locally delivered formulations could maximize pocket-level efficacy while minimizing systemic exposure. Host-immune modulators (e.g., matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors and anti-inflammatory agents) are also being explored for their potential dual benefits in periodontitis and neuroinflammation.7

Progress will require interdisciplinary teams, including dentists and periodontists to stage disease and deliver care, neurologists and geriatricians to track cognition and neuroinflammation, microbiologists and pharmacologists to optimize anti-virulence agents, and public health researchers to evaluate implementation and outcomes. Together, these directions aim to restore oral ecological balance and reduce systemic sequelae.

Oral health is a modifiable factor in AD risk. Chronic periodontitis sustains systemic inflammation and may permit periodontal pathogens, especially Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, to access the brain. Once there, they activate microglia, amplify cytokine cascades, and accelerate amyloid-β and tau pathology.3,4,6

These inflammatory and infectious routes make gum care a prevention target. Priorities include prevention and early intervention, such as lifelong plaque control, timely periodontal therapy, and oral screening in midlife clinics. Further research should clarify the causal mechanisms, validate biomarkers, and test targeted therapies (e.g., gingipain inhibitors, probiotics, anti-virulence strategies) in randomized controlled trials to determine the brain-health benefits.1,3,7

Women's Soccer

By Charlotte Harpur, Melanie Anzidei and Tamerra Griffin

Twenty-one days ago, Alyssa Thompson scored a critical match-winner against the reigning National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) champions, the Orlando Pride, breaking an eight-match winless drought for Angel City FC. She powered the ball past Brazilian forward Marta with her left arm wrapped in a thick cast, making the feat all the more impressive.

It would prove to be the last on-field action of this current chapter with her hometown club, but the story was far from over.

Thompson's arm is still bound in a cast, but now she is wearing the colors of Chelsea Women's team after signing with the eight-time Women's Super League (WSL) title-holders last week.

Though Thompson is still waiting for final eligibility approval on her cast, the PGMOL, which oversees referees in England, states that within WSL Football rules, “player safety is the primary consideration, with any protective equipment deemed dangerous.” Non-soft casts are judged for their safety by the match official, who has the final call. However, Chelsea head coach Sonia Bompastor said in a press conference last week that she is hopeful Thompson will be able to play on Sunday against Aston Villa.

It's been a whirlwind past few weeks for the 20-year-old, which says a lot considering her high-profile roots.

The moment Thompson became Angel City's No. 1 pick in the NWSL draft in January 2023 was a wholesome picture.

Then 18 years old, she was sandwiched on a big couch between her two younger sisters, Gisele and Zoe, surrounded by their parents and dozens of friends and family. There was no real sense of mystery over her draft status, and yet Thompson took deep breaths as she awaited the sound of her name.

As soon as NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman read it, she broke into a wide grin and brought her hands to her face. Thompson had foregone Stanford for this, and now her fate was all but sealed with Angel City as the team entered its second season in Los Angeles.

It didn't take long for her sacrifices to pay off. In Thompson's first 11 minutes of regular-season soccer, she scored her team's only goal in a 2-1 loss to Gotham FC in March 2023.

But Thompson's departure from Angel City two years and eight months later was less pristine.

There were lengthy discussions in a clandestine suite inside BMO Stadium, where Angel City plays, that continued across the continent and ocean to England, Thompson's Instagram Story post of a text message screenshot with the reminder not to “let someone rob your happiness,” and tears that fell during a farewell to teammates before the deal was done.

The tense process was one Angel City and the NWSL would have wanted to prevent from happening altogether. It is another U.S. player now unavailable for promotion after a season without strikers Sophia Wilson and Mallory Swanson (both of whom are on maternity leave) and having only recently seen the return of Trinity Rodman.

“We are diligent and fair in our negotiations to ensure that we protect the rights of the league and our clubs and to maintain strong working relationships around the world,” an NWSL spokesperson told The Athletic.

Still, Thompson blazed her path from Los Angeles to London over the past few weeks as determined as she is when she has the ball at her feet.

Turning back is rarely an option for her.

Even as Chelsea navigated injuries to key players like centerback Kadeisha Buchanan, striker Sam Kerr, and centerback Naomi Girma, for whom the club had paid a then-record $1 million in transfer fees to bring over from the San Diego Wave in January, they still enjoyed an unbeaten season and a domestic treble last year.

Not only are those players back this season, but Chelsea continued padding its roster with the likes of Australian fullback Ellie Carpenter from OL Lyonnes and Swiss goalkeeper Livia Peng from Werder Bremen.

Still, compared to Arsenal's £1 million signing of 21-year-old Olivia Smith in July, Chelsea was quiet during the transfer window until the late push for Thompson. They were reluctant to splurge on another record signing, according to sources briefed on the negotiation, and who, like all in this piece, requested to remain anonymous to protect relationships.

But adding Thompson, for just over $1 million, boosts an already winning squad. On the field, she is one of the top wingers in the world, a position Chelsea has been looking to add depth to. Off it, she provides plenty of marketing upside.

Last Friday, Bompastor said during a press conference that the team decided early in the summer transfer window to bring a new winger into the squad. Thompson's versatility as a right-footed winger, who is comfortable playing down the left flank, appealed to Chelsea, but her profile is not a replacement for Lauren James or Mayra Ramirez, who are dealing with injuries. However, winger Guro Reiten's contract expires at the end of this season.

Chelsea had been monitoring Thompson for some time, but it seemed unlikely she would move given she had just signed a three-year contract extension with Angel City in January. Initially, a January transfer for Thompson after the NWSL season concluded seemed more likely, especially since Angel City occupied ninth place in the table, just outside of playoff contention.

Thompson's success in the NWSL and with the USWNT also comes with more attention from sponsors. Alyssa and Gisele were the first high schoolers to sign a name, image and likeness (NIL) deal with Nike and recently became the face of NYX Professional Makeup's “Make Them Look” campaign.

The sisters have been somewhat of a package deal since Gisele signed with Angel City in December 2023, and they excelled at their Los Angeles club. Their rapid success led to Angel City extending both players' contracts in January. And in May, they connected for the first sister-to-sister goal in NWSL history. The sisters, born just 13 months apart, are extremely close and lived together in Los Angeles.

Angel City pushed to keep the younger Thompson stateside, too, offering the 19-year-old a contract extension through 2029, which they announced the same day Alyssa was presented at Chelsea. Alyssa's move gives the sisters an opportunity to step into their own spotlights.

When Thompson's camp realized Chelsea were serious about making a deal and willing to spend seven figures for the forward, talks sped up, according to sources. Thompson leaned on her family for support and even tapped her U.S. national team head coach Emma Hayes for guidance on Chelsea before making a final decision.

“Emma always talks about her experiences at Chelsea in the national team, and just, like, how much she loved it,” Thompson said in an interview with the club. “But when I talked to Emma about coming here, she really wanted to make sure this was the right decision for me. She really supports her players. She was asking me the right questions to really make me understand if I truly wanted to be here or not.”

Thompson added that engaging with Hayes' questions “helped me know in my heart that I actually did want to come here, even though there would be difficult things that I might face.”

Chelsea's winning record also made for a stark reality check between Angel City and Chelsea as the 2027 World Cup looms. Angel City have played in one NWSL playoff game so far, a 1-0 quarterfinal loss against Seattle Reign in 2023, in which Thompson subbed on during the second half. Since Thompson was not named in the USWNT's 2024 Concacaf W Gold Cup roster or the 2024 Summer Olympics, she has very little experience playing knockout stage football for club or country.

The Guardian first reported Chelsea's interest in Thompson on Thursday, Aug. 28. By Monday, three days before the transfer deadline, Thompson's team was at BMO pushing to get the deal through, as Angel City played Bay FC at home. Time was already thinning, and the fact that the talks took place over Labor Day weekend further slowed negotiations, according to sources.

Thompson was absent from the line-up on an excused absence.

The league told The Athletic its “player affairs team works around the clock to ensure we meet US and international deadlines.”

On Tuesday, Thompson shared a message on Instagram, a screenshot of a text advising the recipient not to “let someone rob your happiness.” However, she would soon be on her way to London, where she arrived Thursday morning around 10 a.m.



Angel City did what it could to keep Alyssa, going as far as offering the highest salary the club could manage, according to a source, but it wasn't enough to sway her final decision.

Before she finally left for London on Wednesday night, still waiting to finalize a deal, Thompson left each of her teammates a handwritten note saying goodbye.

The deal went down to the wire. FaceTime calls stretched across time zones as those involved were up until midnight and 1 a.m. local times. On Thursday, with the deadline nearing, the team filmed promotional material at Cobham, Chelsea's training facility, before the deal was finalized, according to sources. Both Angel City and Chelsea declined to comment on the nature of the talks.

Disputes over contractual language weren't resolved until 8 or 9 p.m., mere hours ahead of the 11 p.m. deadline. In the room were Chelsea's head of women's football, Paul Green, and head of player recruitment TJ O'Leary, Thompson's father, uncle and youth coach, as well as her agents and their commercial team.

As is customary at Chelsea on deadline day, Domino's pizza was ordered, as negotiations continued late into the night.

Thompson and her agent finally signed the transfer papers and confirmed the five-year deal just 30 minutes before the transfer window closed.

The Athletic reported an initial deal valued Thompson's transfer at just under $1.3 million, with other sources later saying the figure is closer to $1.45 million. If all of the contract's add-ons are met, depending on Thompson's and Chelsea's performances over the next five seasons, it will likely raise that total. Angel City announced the move as an NWSL record for an outgoing transfer, surpassing Girma's $1 million.

The heavy investment by Chelsea with their five-year, fully-guaranteed contract is a statement of commitment that the club envisions Thompson as part of their long-term plan.

However, the move is not necessarily a goodbye to Los Angeles, more of a see-you-later.

After all, LA is Thompson's home; it is where her family is, though they plan to make staggered visits to London. With Chelsea, Thompson chose to wear the No. 12 jersey, a quiet nod to the No. 21 she wore with Angel City.

As if scripted by the writers in her hometown of Hollywood, Thompson's Chelsea move means she is returning to the city where she first stepped into the spotlight as a 17-year-old making her national team debut.

On October 7, 2022, the U.S. visited England for a friendly against the recently-crowned European champions England at Wembley Stadium. Ninety thousand fans packed the house for a high-octane meeting between two of the best in the world — and in the 83rd minute, as the U.S. trailed the Lionesses 2-1, Thompson came in as a substitute for Megan Rapinoe. She was and remains the first teenager in USWNT history to make such a high-profile debut.

Even then, her contemplative nature was evident — but equally apparent were the things about which she was certain.

“Since I started playing soccer, this is all I wanted to do,” Thompson, speaking to U.S. Soccer after the game, said. “I'm kind of speechless. Like, it's kind of hitting me now that I just played.”

Angel City forward Alyssa Thompson 's recent move to Chelsea spurred questions about whether the National Women's Soccer League is doing enough to keep its stars. 

There are advantages to playing in the NWSL for many American players: the chance to stay close to home in a league regarded as one of the best in the world. 

But over the years, some of the league's big names have bolted for Europe. Australian Sam Kerr left for Chelsea in 2020, U.S. team captain Lindsey Heaps went to Lyon in 2022. More recently, Crystal Dunn, Emily Fox and Jenna Nighswonger have all moved overseas. 

Earlier this year, Chelsea paid a $1 million transfer fee to the San Diego Wave for U.S. national team defender Naomi Girma. 

Players who have left cite the adventure of living in a new culture and the challenges of a different playing style. 

Thompson's move hit a bit differently because she is still an emerging talent and was playing for her hometown team alongside her younger sister Gisele. Alyssa had signed a deal at the start of the year keeping her with Angel City through 2028. She signed a five-year contract with Chelsea. The terms are not known. 

But her departure has put a spotlight on the NWSL's salary cap, and whether it holds players back from their earning potential.

The NWSL's salary cap is $3.3 million per team. The league has also introduced revenue sharing, bringing the total to $3.5 million. The cap will increase to $5.1 million by 2030. 

The English Women's Super League, in contrast, has a soft cap, which allows clubs to spend up to 40% of revenues on player and coach salaries — but that number is based on the parent clubs, which means teams like Chelsea and Arsenal can count revenues from their men's teams. 

Angel City forward Christen Press and former national team player Tobin Heath called on the NWSL to ditch the salary cap during an episode of their podcast “The Re-CAP Show.”

“There has to be a change. This has to be one of the hottest topics that are happening at the board level of the NWSL, the salary cap," said Heath, who played in the NWSL and overseas. "Because I know that clubs in the NWSL, that are ambitious clubs, that want to be able to compete with the likes of Chelsea, with the likes of Barcelona — these teams are capped out. They can't compete. They're going to lose their best players." 

Heath said that even if teams wanted to sign a player to a big contract, that would mean less money for the rest of the roster, creating an imbalance that likely wouldn't be attractive for an athlete looking to improve by playing against similar talent. 

Ahead of the Champions League semifinal between Lyon and Arsenal in April, Heaps said she wanted a new challenge in moving to France, and theorized that's why others moved, too. 

“I think also the salary cap — there's a salary cap in the NWSL and I think that's an ongoing issue there that hopefully can be changed or increased. I think that's a factor in the NWSL and for players coming overseas," Heaps said during news conference before the semifinal. 

At the same time, there are plenty of players moving from abroad to the NWSL. Women's World Cup winner Esther Gonzalez left Real Madrid to play for Gotham FC. German international Ann Katrin Berger also plays for Gotham and Italy's Sofia Cantore joined the Washington Spirit this summer. 

And there's no shortage of well-known players that — for now — call the NWSL home, including Gotham's Rose Lavelle, Orlando's Marta and the Spirit's Trinity Rodman. 

“It was like an option in my career to do this kind of experience, because I wanted to challenge myself in this league," Cantore said. "And I was really happy when I had the first talk with Washington Spirit, because I had a good feeling about this club, so I decided to come here and to join this club and this league because, as I said, I want to challenge myself, and I want to learn more about myself on the pitch and out of the pitch.”

Alex Morgan, one of the NWSL's original stars, who retired last year, believes the league still needs a salary cap.

“You look at all of the leagues here in the U.S. and the salary cap is here for a reason, the leagues are incredibly successful. And obviously the NWSL is doing something right with the valuation of these teams becoming really high with so much international talent, top talent signing in the U.S., signing in the NWSL in the last couple of years,” Morgan said. “Can you get every single thing right all the time? No. So I think the salary is something NWSL has to look at moving forward. But I think it's fair to say the NWSL is the most competitive league in the world, and it competes as one of the top three leagues overall in the world when you think of talent.”

The Nigeria national team is in danger of missing the World Cup, though the team can only blame itself for being in such a precarious position heading into the final stretch of the CAF qualifiers, where it's all or nothing.


The Moment Nigeria Made a Critical Mistake


The national team, one of the most powerful in the Confederation of African Football (CAF), didn't falter in their latest 1-1 draw against South Africa in Bloemfontein. Instead, their troubles began on the very first matchday of these qualifiers when they drew at home against Lesotho.





This was compounded by a draw on neutral ground against Zimbabwe and a last-minute goal conceded at home against the same team. A loss to Benin, despite taking the lead, further complicated their campaign.

The Super Eagles failed to secure better results against the rest of the group, which is why South Africa leads Group C in the standings, with Benin in second place.





There's a sense of disappointment among Nigeria's fans, as they can't afford to drop points against opponents where even a draw was already considered a loss.


Nigeria Further Complicates Their World Cup Qualification


Nigeria's hopes of qualifying for the FIFA World Cup 2026 took another hit after their 1-1 draw against South Africa. With just 11 points in eight matches, Nigeria has virtually no chance of reaching the continental playoff, even if they win their two remaining games.

After missing the Qatar 2022 World Cup, the Super Eagles could once again be left out of the tournament to be played in the United States, Mexico, and Canada.

The U.S. Under-17 Men's National Team fell in two matches to the Netherlands U-18 side last week in Noordwijk, Netherlands.

On Sept. 5, the USA opened the scoring through Cavan Sullivan in the 11th minute, but the Oranje came back with two goals from Pharrel Nash (21st minute) and Ayoub Ouarghi (29th minute) to earn a 2-1 victory.

On Sept. 8, the USA received goals from Chase Adams in the 20th minute and Maxi Carrizo in the 49th, but fell 8-2 to the home side in the second preparation match.

The U-17 MNT will gather for one last domestic training camp during the October FIFA window before head coach Gonzalo Segares submits his final roster for the 2025 FIFA U-17 World Cup later that month.

The USA will face Burkina Faso (Nov. 5), Tajikistan (Nov. 8) and Czechia (Nov. 11) during Group I play in Qatar.

Sept. 11 (UPI) -- Mexico is investing heavily in culture, infrastructure and technology as it prepares to host 13 matches of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, a tournament expected to draw more than 55.5 million visitors to the country.

Officials project the event will generate about $3 billion for Mexico, create more than 24,000 jobs and showcase the country's regional diversity. Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey will host matches, including the June 11 opening ceremony at Estadio Azteca, which is undergoing a $175 million renovation to increase capacity to 90,000 seats from 87,500.
Tourism Minister Josefina Rodríguez Zamora said the plan seeks to spread World Cup benefits well beyond the stadiums.
"We want every state to feel part of this global celebration," she said at the launch event at Punto México. "From the Pueblos Mágicos to archaeological sites and culinary traditions, the World Cup will be a window to all of Mexico."

Among the initiatives are football tournaments in Pueblos Mágicos, the beautification program Rutas Mágicas de Color and demonstrations of the ancient Mesoamerican ballgame at historic sites.
A gastronomic festival, "Mexico of My Flavors," will run from June 5 to July 22 in Mexico City, bringing together cuisine, crafts and folk art from all 32 states.

The capital's mayor, Clara Brugada, pledged that neighborhoods near the stadium will benefit from more than $350 million in investments, including mobility, security and public services.
"The World Cup is not only about football. It's about improving the lives of residents who live around the venues," she said.
Guadalajara is expanding its airport, adding a new metro line and renovating its historic center. Monterrey is upgrading public spaces and focusing on environmental improvements as part of a broader urban development plan.
Officials also announced a free app, World Cup-Visit Mexico, to guide fans through transport, weather, gastronomy and events in the three host cities. It is .https://x.com/Claudiashein/status/1961265602502561802
Mexico is not alone in preparing. The United States will host 60 matches, including the final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, while Canada will stage 13 games in Vancouver and Toronto.
Canadian carriers have already announced new direct flights connecting Toronto and Montreal with Guadalajara and Mexico City, as well as routes from Vancouver to Mexico.
This will be the first World Cup shared by three countries and the third time Mexico has hosted, after 1970 and 1986. Estadio Azteca will become the only stadium in history to hold three tournament openers.

Officials say the legacy of the 2026 tournament will include renovated stadiums, upgraded airports, urban renewal projects and strengthened cultural tourism.
"Football is passion, but also opportunity," tourism chief Rodríguez Zamora said. "Our goal is that the world remembers Mexico not only for the matches, but for the richness of its culture and the warmth of its people."

USMNT success against Japan may lead Mauricio Pochettino to adopt a different look for FIFA World Cup originally appeared on The Sporting News

Nearly a decade had passed since the last time the head coach of the United States men's national team rolled into Columbus and rolled out a lineup featuring three players in central defense. Less than a week after that disastrous decision, Jurgen Klinsmann no longer was in charge of the USMNT. Mauricio Pochettino went ahead this week and did the same thing, anyway.

As Pochettino and his side appeared in central Ohio for the second of two September friendlies, their circumstance was much different than faced Klinsmann and crew at the start of 2018 World Cup qualifying. For one, the current team actually had some experience with a three-man back line, having deployed such a look at the close of their 2-0 defeat against South Korea last weekend. And most important, the result of their game against Japan carried no consequence beyond public opinion.

Oh, and one more thing: This USMNT appears to be built to excel with this formation.

It might be the best approach for the current team to perform at the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Because this tournament will be contested in the United States, Mexico and Canada, the USMNT do not have to qualify to compete. They just need to improve toward the possibility of excelling. Entering the Japan friendly, they had lost seven consecutive games against FIFA top-30 opponents – the sort of teams they'll need to beat to advance beyond the group stage -- but the change in formation helped ignite a 2-0 victory over Japan that ended the drought.

“It worked fine; very clearly defined roles,” team captain Tim Ream, one of the three central defenders, told us late Tuesday at Lower.com Field. “We did not do much work on it, other than in game and talking about it during a few meetings. I think all of us felt really comfortable.

“I said it the other night: It's another kind of wrinkle for us that we can use in game, in situations. We can start a game that way now. It adds another layer to the team.”

The 3-4-2-1 formation featuring a three-man backline is a change some analysts, particularly former USMNT midfielder Stu Holden of Fox Sports, have pushed for a long time. Though it might force Pochettino into fielding a lineup that does not feature his 11 best players, there are reasons it could be an ideal approach for this roster.

“It simplifies things,” said midfielder Christian Roldan, a veteran of the 2022 World Cup.

It starts with Ream, who will be 38 at the World Cup. No player has developed to displace him from his position, and thus he will become the oldest player (by more than two years) ever to start for the USMNT in this championship. Installing a third center back removes at least a smidge of the responsibility to cover ground from his duties. It also allows him to move forward on occasion and to make greater use of his exceptional passing skill.

Although young Alex Freeman and Max Arfsten played the wingback positions against Japan, regulars Jedi Robinson (absent with an injury) and Sergino Dest appear to be ideally suited to playing in those roles, which require covering the entire sideline during the course of the game but are oriented toward the attack.

“I think we have players that they play in this new formation … they play in their clubs in that system,” Pochettino said, noting central defender Chris Richards with Crystal Palace in England. “I think it's good to have different plans, approach to the games. That formation is more simple to understand for the players than the formation we started in against South Korea.

“I think we have a squad that can fit very well in that system, in that formation.”

Under Gregg Berhalter at the 2022 World Cup, the U.S. played a 4-3-3 formation that emphasized possession of the ball, a particular specialty of young midfielder Yunus Musah, and positioned star Christian Pulisic on the left side of a 3-man front line.

In the newer formation, he played centrally as a playmaker, what is commonly referred to as a “No. 10”. (Conveniently, that is Pulisic's jersey number with the USMNT). If summer star Malik Tillman had been in camp instead of remaining with Bayer Leverkusen in Germany to continue recovering from a minor injury, he likely would have started alongside Pulisic behind striker Folarin Balogun.

“I think it's another good option, especially when you line up against teams with a back five,” Pulisic told The Sporting News. “It just matches up really well against them. It was much easier for us, much clearer. I think that helped us, for sure.”

Moving to three players in central defense and two wingbacks quite possibly will relegate 2022 starter Tim Weah to a substitute's role. And Musah, Johnny Cardoso and Weston McKennie would fight for the second defensive midfield spot alongside Tyler Adams.

That's why decisions such as this are not easy.

It really has nothing to do with the failure of the experiment in November 2016, when Mexico visited what his now termed as “Historic Crew Stadium” in Columbus to open qualifying for Russia 2018. But the coincidence is interesting. The USMNT had not used the three-man back line under Klinsmann at any point, and some players reported afterward they'd barely practiced it. The approach was such a disaster Mexico dominated play in the early stages and scored on a Miguel Layun shot in the 20th minute. Not long afterward, midfielder Michael Bradley was observed shouting at the sideline to get the USMNT out of the formation. After the Americans tied the game early in the second half, Mexico won it late on a header by nemesis Rafa Marquez.

The lost points in the Mexico game became a huge part of the failure to qualify for the World Cup. When the USMNT were buried, 4-0, at Costa Rica the following Tuesday, Klinsmann was replaced.

Pochettino has no such concerns, either with his job security or the USMNT position in the 2026 World Cup. They'll be there. He'll be there. How he arranges the players as the tournament begins will be an important element of how it all turns out.

Mike DeCourcy

Nearly a decade had passed since the last time the head coach of the United States men's national team rolled into Columbus and rolled out a lineup featuring three players in central defense. Less than a week after that disastrous decision, Jurgen Klinsmann no longer was in charge of the USMNT. Mauricio Pochettino went ahead this week and did the same thing, anyway.

As Pochettino and his side appeared in central Ohio for the second of two September friendlies, their circumstance was much different than faced Klinsmann and crew at the start of 2018 World Cup qualifying. For one, the current team actually had some experience with a three-man back line, having deployed such a look at the close of their 2-0 defeat against South Korea last weekend. And most important, the result of their game against Japan carried no consequence beyond public opinion.

Oh, and one more thing: This USMNT appears to be built to excel with this formation.

It might be the best approach for the current team to perform at the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Because this tournament will be contested in the United States, Mexico and Canada, the USMNT do not have to qualify to compete. They just need to improve toward the possibility of excelling. Entering the Japan friendly, they had lost seven consecutive games against FIFA top-30 opponents – the sort of teams they'll need to beat to advance beyond the group stage -- but the change in formation helped ignite a 2-0 victory over Japan that ended the drought.

“It worked fine; very clearly defined roles,” team captain Tim Ream, one of the three central defenders, told us late Tuesday at Lower.com Field. “We did not do much work on it, other than in game and talking about it during a few meetings. I think all of us felt really comfortable.

“I said it the other night: It's another kind of wrinkle for us that we can use in game, in situations. We can start a game that way now. It adds another layer to the team.”

The 3-4-2-1 formation featuring a three-man backline is a change some analysts, particularly former USMNT midfielder Stu Holden of Fox Sports, have pushed for a long time. Though it might force Pochettino into fielding a lineup that does not feature his 11 best players, there are reasons it could be an ideal approach for this roster.

“It simplifies things,” said midfielder Christian Roldan, a veteran of the 2022 World Cup.

It starts with Ream, who will be 38 at the World Cup. No player has developed to displace him from his position, and thus he will become the oldest player (by more than two years) ever to start for the USMNT in this championship. Installing a third center back removes at least a smidge of the responsibility to cover ground from his duties. It also allows him to move forward on occasion and to make greater use of his exceptional passing skill.

Although young Alex Freeman and Max Arfsten played the wingback positions against Japan, regulars Jedi Robinson (absent with an injury) and Sergino Dest appear to be ideally suited to playing in those roles, which require covering the entire sideline during the course of the game but are oriented toward the attack.

“I think we have players that they play in this new formation … they play in their clubs in that system,” Pochettino said, noting central defender Chris Richards with Crystal Palace in England. “I think it's good to have different plans, approach to the games. That formation is more simple to understand for the players than the formation we started in against South Korea.

“I think we have a squad that can fit very well in that system, in that formation.”

Under Gregg Berhalter at the 2022 World Cup, the U.S. played a 4-3-3 formation that emphasized possession of the ball, a particular specialty of young midfielder Yunus Musah, and positioned star Christian Pulisic on the left side of a 3-man front line.

In the newer formation, he played centrally as a playmaker, what is commonly referred to as a “No. 10”. (Conveniently, that is Pulisic's jersey number with the USMNT). If summer star Malik Tillman had been in camp instead of remaining with Bayer Leverkusen in Germany to continue recovering from a minor injury, he likely would have started alongside Pulisic behind striker Folarin Balogun.

“I think it's another good option, especially when you line up against teams with a back five,” Pulisic told The Sporting News. “It just matches up really well against them. It was much easier for us, much clearer. I think that helped us, for sure.”

Moving to three players in central defense and two wingbacks quite possibly will relegate 2022 starter Tim Weah to a substitute's role. And Musah, Johnny Cardoso and Weston McKennie would fight for the second defensive midfield spot alongside Tyler Adams.

That's why decisions such as this are not easy.

It really has nothing to do with the failure of the experiment in November 2016, when Mexico visited what his now termed as “Historic Crew Stadium” in Columbus to open qualifying for Russia 2018. But the coincidence is interesting. The USMNT had not used the three-man back line under Klinsmann at any point, and some players reported afterward they'd barely practiced it. The approach was such a disaster Mexico dominated play in the early stages and scored on a Miguel Layun shot in the 20th minute. Not long afterward, midfielder Michael Bradley was observed shouting at the sideline to get the USMNT out of the formation. After the Americans tied the game early in the second half, Mexico won it late on a header by nemesis Rafa Marquez.

The lost points in the Mexico game became a huge part of the failure to qualify for the World Cup. When the USMNT were buried, 4-0, at Costa Rica the following Tuesday, Klinsmann was replaced.

Pochettino has no such concerns, either with his job security or the USMNT position in the 2026 World Cup. They'll be there. He'll be there. How he arranges the players as the tournament begins will be an important element of how it all turns out.

by Alejandro Lopez Vega September 11, 2025

Thomas Tuchel is taking his first steps as head coach of the England national team, and so far, results have gone his way. Following the September international break, he shared a candid message ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2026 that could impact stars like Jude Bellingham and Trent Alexander-Arnold.

Convincing wins over Andorra and Serbia put England within touching distance of securing qualification for the next World Cup. What made the team's performance even more impressive was the fact that it came despite the absence of several top players.

Jude Bellingham was the most notable omission from the September call-up, as he remains sidelined after undergoing shoulder surgery following his appearance at the Club World Cup 2025 with Real Madrid. Other stars left out due to injury included Manchester City's Phil Foden and Chelsea's Cole Palmer.

The situation was different for a few other top-tier players who were not selected by Tuchel, not due to injury, but for tactical reasons. Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jack Grealish were among those left out — both having recently made club changes.

Asked whether he would be willing to leave major stars off the roster if necessary, Tuchel didn't hesitate. “I am always brave – you know that,” the coach said, according to The Guardian. “We took some brave decisions already. We nominated a squad of only 21 (outfield players) to keep the competition going.”

With the World Cup now just nine months away, Thomas Tuchel knows he doesn't have time to waste when shaping his squad. “The competition for places is on,” he said. “If you are in camp, you are in your best behaviour, your best shape, best form and you make the best of it. It's a privilege to be in camp and then fight for your place … if you can help everyone to be better and to grow. This is what we did.”

Finally, the German coach made it clear that the potential absence of a star is a scenario he must always be ready for. “If a big player misses out on a tournament, we need to have solutions; if he misses a camp, we need to have solutions,” Tuchel said. “We have to focus on the guys who are available and who are ready to be the best versions of themselves and the best teammate possible.”

Under Thomas Tuchel, England have found strong results. The German coach has led the team in six matches, recording five wins and one loss. That defeat came in the only unofficial match of his tenure — a friendly against Senegal in June.

In the World Cup qualifiers, England have been flawless. They lead Group K with a perfect record, having won all five of their matches. They could secure their spot in the 2026 tournament as early as the October international break.

As excitement continues to build for FIFA World Cup 26 next summer at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium, the ways to snag a ticket to the world's largest sporting event are beginning to come into focus, starting with a presale for Visa cardholders.

The Coughlin family in Overland Park is pumped for the chance to see World Cup soccer a short drive from their home.

“Definitely my son, for sure,” Jennifer Coughlin said Wednesday as the family visited Union Station. “He's our all-sports lover, but definitely soccer is his jam.”

Ellis Coughlin and his sister, Kemper, don't have much of an opinion on the price point for World Cup tickets, but they would love to attend a match.

“That would be really cool,” Ellis said. “I play soccer, so I always like watching it, too. ... I've been playing since I was 3 (years old).”

Kemper chimed in: “I'm excited, and I play soccer, too.”

Kansas City will host six World Cup games, including a quarterfinal, but the ticketing process is much different from what fans are used to for a Chiefs or Royals game — perhaps even downright confusing.

When premium ticket packages went on sale in April, the prices were jarring — $1,225 to $3,000 per ticket, through OnLocation — for budget-conscious families. But those tickets are primarily geared toward corporate buyers and fans seeking a high-end, all-inclusive experience.

“I've got a wife and kids and we've talked a bunch about (how) this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, especially being able to drive to it,” Brendan Cossette, a soccer fan from Columbia, Missouri, said. “But at the same time, like everything else, there's a line where going to see Australia play Croatia — OK, that's cool, but it's not $8,000-a-ticket cool. ... I've heard all kinds of rumors that they're extraordinarily expensive.”

Fortunately, for Cossette and the Coughlins, those rumors don't have much merit.

FIFA announced Sept. 3 that tickets for the group stage would start at $60, which puts them in line with ticket prices for Sporting Kansas City's game against Lionel Messi and Inter Miami FC, an April 2024 game at Arrowhead that drew more than 70,000 fans.

Tickets for those games started at $50 for end-zone seats in the upper deck, up to $240 for seats along the sideline in the lower bowl. Club tickets cost $360 to $480 for the Messi game.

There were nine ticket-price levels for that game, but may be as few as four for World Cup matches, so prices may be slightly higher or lower than they were for Sporting KC-Inter Miami, which drew the largest crowd for a soccer game in Missouri history.

“That's no more expensive than you're gonna pay to go to a Chiefs game, so I think that's reasonable, especially for a once-in-a-lifetime event,” Cossette said.

The Coughlin family also welcomed the news.

“We're trying to get to a lot of games, a lot of different sports this season,” Jennifer Coughlin said. “... We're probably looking at lower price, higher seating.”

It doesn't matter to Ellis Coughlin; any World Cup game in his hometown would be a thrill.

“I just like seeing good soccer,” Ellis said.

Soccer doesn't get better than the World Cup.

The Visa presale draw is the first phase of sales to the general public.

Registration ends on Sept. 19, and fans selected by lottery will be notified beginning Sept. 29 ahead of the Oct. 1 presale. Tickets during that presale must be purchased with the Visa credit or debit card provided when signing up.

A second early draw, which is expected to include fans who previously bought right-to-buy options through FIFA, will take place Oct. 27-31, with another draw slated for mid-December after the tournament's final draw takes place Dec. 5.

That phase of ticket sales will be the first when buyers know what teams will be playing in the group-stage matches.

During the October phase, tickets will be sold, but the opponents for the games won't yet be known.

Any remaining tickets will go on sale next spring, closer to the games being played.

Tickets to all 104 games — including matches in Canada and Mexico, up to and including the World Cup final — will be available during the presales.

However, fans can buy tickets to all matches at a venue, including Arrowhead, or for a particular team, including the U.S. Men's National Team.

Initial ticket limits will be four per game and 20 overall, per FIFA.

The website to register for the Visa presale crashed at various times Wednesday, but FIFA stressed that fans can register at any time until Sept. 19 and have the same chance of being selected.

“As we expected, demand for tickets to the FIFA World Cup 26 is extraordinary,” FIFA said in a statement to KSHB 41 News. “We were experiencing initial extended wait times as the registration period opened. Importantly, timing of a fan's entry into the Visa Presale Draw will not impact the fan's chances of success — everyone who registers during the entry period, which is open until 11 a.m. ET on Sept. 19, will have the same likelihood of being selected to have the opportunity to purchase tickets.”

João Pedro says "it's the beginning of a beautiful story" after the 23-year-old earned a call-up to the Brazil squad. (1:30)

It is a sobering thought, but in previous World Cup qualification campaigns, Brazil would have needed to go through a playoff to secure their place in the tournament. With the expansion to 48 teams, they made it through relatively comfortably, but there's a lot of work ahead, and not much time in which to do it.

Carlo Ancelotti only has friendlies in October, November and March before naming his squad. The arrival of the Italian manager has strengthened Brazil's defense, with just one goal -- a VAR-awarded penalty -- scored against them in the past four games.

Getting the attack to click will be one of Ancelotti's priorities, and where he will be seeking to solve something that, surprisingly, has plagued Brazil in recent times: Who is going to play at center forward?

- World Cup onside/offside: Good win for USMNT, Messi's last dance?
- Gattuso's Italy now have a potent attack, but what's happened to their defending?
- Can anyone stop Yamal and Spain marching to World Cup glory?

This is the country of Leônidas and Ademir de Menezes, the top scorers respectively of the World Cups of 1938 and 1950. Then, in the five World Cup-winning teams, they had Vavá, Tostão, Romario, and Ronaldo. It is a fabulous tradition.

But with more wingers than they know what to do with, producing strikers that like to play through the middle has proven something of a headache. Going into the 2018 World Cup in Russia, Gabriel Jesus appeared to have the position sewn up. But he had a very disappointing tournament, which seemed to rob him of his confidence as a goalscorer, and that, combined with a run of injuries, has cast him to the sidelines.

Suddenly, though, the cupboard does not look so bare. A battle for the position will take place over the next few months, much of it in the Premier League.

Richarlison, Brazil's center forward in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, is once again a strong candidate, and he has two big advantages. One is that Ancelotti is a fan, after working with him at Everton, and the other is that he looks fit and fresh. He clearly endured a lot from being released to play both the Copa América and the Olympic tournament in 2021.

It was a case of too much football, and it took its toll with a succession of minor injuries over the next few years. But now he says that he has enjoyed his best preseason for years, and the early signs are that he is looking very sharp.

He faces plenty of competition. A different type of striker is João Pedro, whose profile in Brazil benefited enormously from that move to Chelsea during the FIFA Club World Cup. He came off the bench to give his home crowd an impressive display of his skill and versatility. Richarlison is a vertical, front-to-goal striker, but João Pedro is much more proficient at dropping to combine, which came through in his performance last week against Chile.

Matheus Cunha would have been there in the squad alongside them, eager for his audition, but he was forced out by injury. His chance will probably come.

A star of the Under-23 team that won the gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics, Cunha was probably unfortunate not to go to the last World Cup. Two things counted against him. Given a run in the Qatar qualifiers, he did not do badly, but he did not score. It also counted against him that he had never played professionally at home. Instead, he had bounced around from Switzerland, Germany, Spain and then on to England occasionally falling out with coaches as he went.

His move to Manchester United could well be make or break. It has increased his visibility, and it is now up to him to take advantage. With his capacity to play up front or just behind the main striker, he could well find himself in direct competition with João Pedro.

The lively Evanilson at Bournemouth is another possible candidate, but one who Ancelotti certainly has his eye on is recent Nottingham Forest signing Igor Jesus.

In one of his first days in Brazil, Ancelotti was in the stadium to see Igor Jesus come out with an outstanding display to keep Botafogo in the Copa Libertadores. In a game they had to win, they had a man sent off early, but Igor Jesus carried them over the line and produced a performance of similar quality when Botafogo beat Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup.

A one-man forward line who also works hard as the first line of defense, Igor Jesus comes across as an example of the spirit of sacrifice that Ancelotti craves. The problem, though, is whether the striker will get enough game time in his first season at Forest.

There are some home-based candidates for Ancelotti to assess. Kaio Jorge of Cruzeiro made his debut off the bench last week against Chile and was then forced out of the Bolivia game by injury.

An intelligent, nimble striker, he did not succeed in Italy with Juventus, but has picked up momentum since moving back. Much the same applies to Vitor Roque, a flop at Barcelona but starting to find his powerful feet at Palmeiras. And there is always Pedro of Flamengo, who went to the last World Cup. A firm favorite with the fans, Pedro is a superb finisher, although doubts remain about whether he is sufficiently quick and mobile for the modern game.

And what about Endrick? He looked like the boy wonder less than a year and a half ago when he scored the winner at Wembley and was on target a few days later away to Spain.

He perhaps suffered from a premature move to Real Madrid, where Ancelotti struggled to fit him into a lineup that already had to make space for Kylian Mbappé. Might Endrick find some form between now and next June?

There is no shortage of options, then, for Ancelotti to go looking for a center forward. But there is a shortage of time to sift through those options. Candidates will have to take all the chances they have, which means that every Premier League weekend is not only to compete for points, but also to compete to lead the attacking line for Brazil in the World Cup.

The U.S. soccer federation have reportedly approached their French counterparts to raise the prospect of scheduling a friendly in March 2026 ahead of next summer's World Cup.

As co-hosts together with Mexico and Canada, the U.S. men's national team (USMNT) will not play another competitive fixture until their first game of the World Cup group phase on June 12, 2026. There are still three international windows to navigate before next summer, with a glut of friendlies against Uruguay, Ecuador and Australia already in the diary for 2025.

However, when the first break of the new year rolls around in March, the USMNT have their sights set on some more high-profile fixtures. There has already been whispers of a clash against Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal and it now appears as though France are next on the list.

France's governing body for soccer has received an open invitation from the U.S. for a friendly in March, according to L'Équipe. This proposed arrangement would also see Didier Deschamps's side play one of Mexico or Canada in the same month. However, these grand plans can only take place if France have secured automatic qualification to the World Cup by then—should Les Bleus fail to finish top of their group, they could face a playoff in March.

The 2022 World Cup finalists have made a winning start to their qualification campaign thanks in no small part to a pair of record-toppling goals from Kylian Mbappé. Few are more aware of the qualities boasted by France's captain than Pochettino, who coached the prolific forward at Paris Saint-Germain for 18 months.

Mbappé rattled in 67 goals across 75 appearances under the Argentine at PSG between January 2021 and July 2022. 

Pochettino led a side which also included Neymar to the Champions League semifinals but could only earn a second-place finish in Ligue 1. Lionel Messi arrived that summer and helped Pochettino and co. re-establish their domestic dominance but PSG only made it to the Champions League last 16.

Mbappé and the rest of his star forwards received criticism for their perceived inactivity when out of possession—a trait which is still causing debates at Real Madrid—but Pochettino was always quick to defend the Frenchman.

“Kylian is a player who does not need to be connected with the overall game,” he wrote for The Athletic during the last World Cup. “He can be there for five or even 10 minutes, not involved in the game, not involved with his team, and then just appear, do something amazing, and win you the match.”

Olé! The 2026 FIFA World Cup is fast approaching, promising the largest tournament yet — with 48 teams participating and three host nations.

If you're hoping to attend a match (or several) during next year's World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, now's your chance. The first round of ticket sales has begun — sort of.

Thanks to FIFA's partnership with Visa, the first tickets are available exclusively to Visa cardholders. Here's everything you need to know to snag tickets during this and future ticket drops.

Fans can already purchase 2026 World Cup hospitality packages, which include match tickets, on FIFA's site. However, buying tickets alone is a little more complicated.

The first phase of ticket purchases, the Visa Presale Draw, opened Wednesday, Sept. 10.

Why is it called a "draw" and not a "sale," you ask? Because if you "win" the draw, you'll get a chance to buy tickets at a later date — though there's no guarantee tickets will be available during your assigned time slot.

The draw will close at 11:00 a.m. ET on Friday, Sept. 19. The day and time at which you enter the draw will not affect your chances of success, so don't worry about rushing to FIFA's site right away.

According to the site, "In order to enter the draw, you must be the cardholder (primary or secondary) in good standing of a valid, unexpired Visa debit card, credit card, or reloadable prepaid card enabled with 3D Secure."

By signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy. You may unsubscribe at any time.

Unfortunately, holding the right card is just the first of many hoops you must jump through to score tickets during this round.

First, head to this page and click "Learn more" under "Tickets."

You'll then be asked to fill in a captcha, after which you'll join a queue to enter the draw. That's right, you must wait in line to put your name into a virtual hat in order to possibly win a chance to buy tickets.

While you're waiting — or before entering the draw — be sure to register for a FIFA ID here. You'll need it (and your eligible Visa card) when it comes time to enter the draw.

Several TPGers have tried to enter, with mixed results. Some timed out while they were in the queue. I made it through the queue after about an hour and a half, then signed in with my FIFA ID only to find an error message. One lucky editor managed to actually enter the draw with her Visa card information.

After the draw ends on Sept. 19, a randomized selection process will determine who gets a chance to buy tickets during the first phase. If successful, you'll be notified via email on or after Sept. 29, and you'll be given a date and time slot to purchase tickets starting Oct. 1.

During this round of sales, single-match tickets to all 104 World Cup games will be available, with group-stage tickets starting at $60. You'll also be able to purchase venue-specific and team-specific tickets (i.e., all matches for a specific venue or team).

Since FIFA predicted high demand (accurately, based on our experience trying to enter the presale draw), they decided to release tickets in phases. If, for whatever reason, you can't secure tickets during the presale, you'll have an opportunity to get tickets during the later phases:

FIFA also plans to launch an official 2026 World Cup resale platform later this year, potentially providing another avenue to get tickets.

If FIFA's complex ticketing process and glitchy website seem to be sucking the joy from the beautiful game, don't despair. You have until Sept. 19 to enter the Visa Presale Draw (if you have an eligible card), and there will be more opportunities to score tickets in the coming months.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico will be kicking off in just nine months.

Including the host nations, 48 teams will feature in the biggest football tournament on the planet, with only 18 so far confirmed to be present in the event.

A few of those sides stamped their tickets during September's international break, marking another milestone en route to the soccer showcase. 

Ahead of FIFA's next world football ranking due on September 18, Bleacher Report has updated its own classification from March following the latest fixtures. 

The strength of recent opponents, tournament success, and qualifying-stage performances were factors taken into account to determine the order of our International Power Rankings for September. 

20. Iran

FIFA ranking: 20

B/R March ranking: 19

September marked the worst international break for Iran in some time, with the team drawing 2-2 with Tajikistan and losing 1-0 to Uzbekistan—the latter in the CAFA Nations Cup final.

Still, the Iranians have suffered just three defeats since the turn of 2023, and they secured qualification for the World Cup back in March.

With Switzerland, South Korea, Senegal and Tunisia knocking on the B/R Power Rankings' door, Iran just about holds on in the top 20. 

19. Japan

FIFA ranking: 17

B/R March ranking: 18 

Japan sealed qualification to the World Cup in March, taking the pressure off of the national team significantly. 

That's perhaps not helping, with the Samurai Blue drawing to Mexico and losing to the United States in September.

Before those results, though, things were looking pretty good for the AFC representatives, who had only lost once—to Australia—since February 2024.

However, things turned sour when Japan faced higher-ranked teams, which is a bad omen as the World Cup approaches.

18. United States

FIFA ranking: 15

B/R March ranking: 14

Just when you think all hope is lost, the United States men's national team has a habit of reeling you back in.

After the Stars and Stripes suffered a poor stretch of results from March to early June, which saw them lose four of four games—including defeats in the Nations League semifinal to Panama and the third-place playoff to Canada—they then went on a run to the Gold Cup final, where they lost 2-1 to Mexico.

In September, a 2-0 loss to South Korea had head coach Mauricio Pochettino on the hot seat, only for him to turn the temperature down with a 2-0 victory over Japan.

It's difficult to know where the USMNT is with the World Cup less than a year away. It would be foolish to sack the manager with the tournament in reach, but it's fair to say the Argentinian has not brought the transformation many were hoping for. 

17. Norway

FIFA ranking: 33

B/R March ranking: New entry

Norway is on a bit of a tear in World Cup qualifying. 

The Scandinavian nation top Group I with five wins from five, scoring 24 goals and conceding just three in the process. 

It's a stunning run of form. While the 11-1 win against Moldova stands out immediately—with Erling Haaland grabbing five of those goals—the 3-0 victory over Italy is the most impressive result in the qualification stages. 

There's a real chance Norway could confine the Azzurri to the qualification playoffs while stealing a World Cup berth for itself, which would be the nation's first appearance in the competition since 1998. 

16. Ecuador

FIFA ranking: 25

B/R March ranking: 11

Ecuador falls a bit from its lofty position in the March rankings, which was earned after exceptional performances in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying.

La Tricolor finished second in the federation's table after 18 games, ahead of notable teams such as Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay. 

While that is impressive, Ecuador had a disappointing run of four straight 0-0 draws from March 26 to September 5, although it broke that streak with a 1-0 victory over Argentina to close out the latest international period. 

Its 16th position in this ranking is still a fair jump from its FIFA ranking of 25th, though.

15. Uruguay

FIFA ranking: 16

B/R March ranking: 15

Uruguay might be the most frustrating team in South America. 

After finishing third in the 2024 Copa America, La Celeste went on to win just one of seven games to close out the year. 

After a narrow loss to Argentina in March, they then drew 0-0 with Bolivia and followed that with a 2-0 loss to Paraguay in June.

Wins against Venezuela (2-0) and Peru (3-0) seemed to suggest things were back on track, but then they chalked up a lackluster 0-0 draw against 57th-ranked Chile.  

But after sealing qualification with that win over Peru, perhaps Uruguay took its foot off the gas a little.

It's just difficult to get a read on this team. On paper, the squad is strong enough to cause problems for opponents, but it just can't seem to muster any kind of consistency. 

14. Italy

FIFA ranking: 11B/R March ranking: 9

Things aren't disastrous for Italy, but it might be getting worried about World Cup qualification with Norway's remarkable form.

As it stands, it looks like the Azzurri will have to go through the 16-team second-place playoff for qualification, with the Scandinavians setting a blistering pace through Group I.

Italy scored 10 in two World Cup qualifying games in September, but questions need to be asked after shipping four goals (including two own goals) against Israel.

Those defensive issues, and the uncertainty of making it to the finals, informs Italy's fall in our rankings.

13. Belgium

FIFA ranking: 8

B/R March ranking: 16

Belgium players found their scoring boots in September, even in the absence of Romelu Lukaku. 

The Red Devils smashed in six against Liechtenstein and did the same against Kazakhstan, keeping a clean sheet in both matches. 

Although they sit second in their qualifying group to North Macedonia, they have a game in hand over the Lynxes and should claim top spot when things get settled. 

After winning only four of 14 games in 2024, Belgium has already won four out of six in 2025. Rudi Garcia deserves a huge amount of credit for turning things around quickly after the disastrous reign of Domenico Tedesco.

12. Croatia

FIFA ranking: 10

B/R March ranking: 13

Things were looking starting bleak for Croatia last year, but the team has come back to life in 2025.

After an unfortunate Nations League quarter-final exit to France following a penalty shootout, Croatia has won its last four games with a total score of 17-1. 

Granted, the Vatreni didn't play a team ranked higher than 41st during that time, and they only squeaked past the 141st-ranked Faroe Islands 1-0, but that's still a decent record.

The veterans are still turning up for Croatia. Key players such as Luka Modric, Ivan Perisic, Andrej Kramaric and Mateo Kovacic clock up an average age of 35, but they are proving essential.

At the top of World Cup qualification Group L with a game in hand, the Vatreni should be looking ahead to the tournament with increasing confidence. They might not grab a third-place finish like they did in 2022, but they will still be competitive.

11. Colombia

FIFA ranking: 14

B/R March ranking: 8

Colombia takes a bit of a tumble in our rankings after a few disappointing results since March. 

Draws against Peru and a 10-man Argentina in July weren't especially encouraging, and better form from other teams in the ranking hasn't helped Los Cafeteros' cause.

A further slide was saved after their positive September results, beating Bolivia 3-0 and Venezuela 6-3. But with those teams ranked 78th and 46th, respectively, comfortable victories should have been expected.

Most importantly, though, victory against Bolivia ensured their ticket for the 2026 World Cup. 

The unpredictable nature of this Colombia side will make the nation a feared proposition next year, and don't rule out the South Americans making a run to the latter stages.

10. Mexico

FIFA ranking: 13

B/R March ranking: 12

Mexico has a taste for trophies at the moment. It picked up its second consecutive Gold Cup title in July after winning the Nations League in March. 

Ahead of a World Cup as co-hosts, a winning mentality isn't the worst thing to have.

While that's all well and good, El Tri will be a little concerned about results against teams outside of their federation. They lost 4-2 to Switzerland at home in June, and they only managed draws against Japan (0-0) and South Korea (2-2) in September.

They'll need to step things up a level next summer if they want to make a big statement. 

9. Morocco

FIFA ranking: 12

B/R March ranking: 17

Morocco became the first African nation to qualify for the 2026 World Cup in September's international break, with a 5-0 win over Niger sealing the deal. 

With two games to spare, head coach Walid Regragui will be allowed to tinker in the remaining qualification fixtures and rest key players.

While the quality of opponents isn't as strong for the Atlas Lions when compared to other continental qualification tournaments, they still have plenty of momentum.  

Morocco hasn't been beaten since January 2024 (aside from in the African Nations Championship, a tournament that first-team international players are not typically involved in). 

The Atlas Lions still have plenty of the stars who took them to the 2022 World Cup semifinal, and you can't rule out their chances of doing so again, with Achraf Hakimi, Bono, Brahim Diaz and Noussair Mazraoui making up a strong core of talent. 

8. Germany

FIFA ranking: 9

B/R March ranking: 3

Something's not quite right with Germany. 

A Nations League semifinal loss to Portugal is forgivable, as is a third-place play-off loss to France, but the 2-0 defeat to 52nd-ranked Slovakia in its first game of World Cup qualifying will have set off some alarm bells.

After the 3-1 win against Northern Ireland, Die Nationalelf are only third in Group A after two games and they have made qualification for the world football showcase a little more difficult.

There are still plenty of games to right the ship, but head coach Julian Nagelsmann will be worried how the Slovakia defeat will affect the team psychologically.

7. Netherlands

FIFA Ranking: 7 

B/R March ranking: 10

An 8-0 thrashing of Malta is the Netherlands' most notable result of 2025. Putting eight past the 168th-ranked team in the world shouldn't be that much to shout about, but you can't argue with the message that kind of scoreline sends. 

Elsewhere, the Oranje's results don't look too bad in context. They have just three wins in six in 2025, but they have a draw and a penalty-shootout defeat to Spain, as well as a draw with Poland, among those results.

They are top of Group G with a game in hand and should progress to the tournament proper without a lot of stress. After giving Spain a scare in the Nations League, the Netherlands should be fairly happy with the level it is showing.

6. Brazil

FIFA ranking: 5

B/R March ranking: 7

Brazil's September international camp is tough to read into, given the wildly contrasting starting XIs involved in its 3-0 victory over Chile and 1-0 loss to Bolivia. 

New manager Carlo Ancelotti needs a little time to figure things out, and with an array of stars available and limited spaces to put them, some teething issues are expected.

That talent pool has become even more crowded thanks to Estevão's fast start to life at Chelsea, which adds another exciting element to the squad. 

The Seleçao sealed their spot in the 2026 World Cup in June, so it's understandable if motivation was lacking, especially ahead of a tournament in which they will likely be considered among the favorites no matter what.

It's still not clear what the preferred starting XI will be and how they will set up tactically, but there's plenty of time to get things right ahead of the action in the neighboring continent.

FIFA ranking: 4

B/R March ranking: 4

It was difficult to muster enthusiasm for England under Thomas Tuchel's guidance, despite the Three Lions having lost just one of five in 2025 ahead of the meeting with Serbia.

In two matches against Andorra, one against Latvia, and one against Albania—teams with an average world ranking of 138.6—the Three Lions scored just eight goals. Conceding none should be more or less expected, but the woeful scoring return was cause for concern.

But then England thrashed 32nd-ranked Serbia 5-0 with a performance that demonstrated plenty of positive signs in terms of squad formation and tactical framework. 

After functional but boring performances under Tuchel, that win against Serbia is perhaps a sign of things to come.

FIFA Ranking: 3 

B/R March Ranking: 5

Four wins from six in 2025 for France might not be as dominant as a squad of this caliber would hope for, but there is some nuance around the two losses that makes them less troubling.

A 2-0 away defeat to Croatia in the Nations League quarter-finals first leg was quickly remedied with a 2-0 reverse at home in the second leg and an eventual win on penalties. 

Then, Les Bleus lost an instant international classic against Spain 5-4, coming back from 4-0 down after 55 minutes.

While the latter will be slightly concerning, given the hole they dug for themselves, it does show the group's fighting spirit, which will be crucial ahead of the World Cup.

Meanwhile, having likely Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembélé in the setup, alongside superstar Kylian Mbappé and one of Europe's most in-form players in Michael Olise, counts for a lot.

FIFA Ranking: 6

B/R March Ranking: 6 

The reigning UEFA Nations League champions climb here partly because of that silverware. It might not be the most prestigious of titles, but it still counts for our ranking purposes.

Portugal has been handed a kind World Cup qualification draw, and it started the campaign with back-to-back wins over Armenia and Hungary away from home. 

The death of Diogo Jota will no doubt cast a shadow over the Seleçao's preparations for the global showpiece, but it also gives them something more to fight for. 

"We want to carry forward his values, which helped us win the Nations League, because he was a true leader in the dressing room," Portugal head coach Roberto Martinez told FIFA.com ahead of the national team's first camp since the 28-year-old died in July. "His strength, battling spirit and determination must always remain with us."

Cristiano Ronaldo is still defying Father Time with crucial goals for his country, including in the Nations League final—he is also now the joint-top scoring player in World Cup qualifying history (39). 

With qualification for the 2026 World Cup already looking like a formality, the 40-year-old will be desperate to maintain that scoring form and play a big role in trying to pick up one of the few major titles he's not claimed. After all, it will surely be his final appearance on the world stage.

FIFA Ranking: 1

B/R March Ranking: 2

Argentina just missed out on top spot in our March rankings, and it does so again this time around.

La Albiceleste have won four of their six games in 2025, with a draw against Colombia in June and a defeat to Ecuador in September. However, with World Cup qualification sealed, the latter is of little concern. 

Admittedly, if they did manage to defeat La Tricolor, they could have claimed top spot. Spain's Nations League final defeat to Portugal gave the Argentinians an opening, but they weren't able to take it.

It's perhaps too early to suggest Argentina will claim back-to-back World Cups, but it is in a positive position ahead of the 2026 tournament.

FIFA Ranking: 2

B/R March Ranking: 1

Spain maintains its spot at the top of the B/R Power Rankings despite a mildly shocking defeat in the all-Iberian Nations League final.

While the game finished 2-2 after 120 minutes, a perfect set of penalties from the Seleçao meant La Furia Roja couldn't add to their trophy cabinet.

But it doesn't mean a drop in ranking terms. 

There's no real cause for concern, with Spain having won four of its last six—if you include the penalty-shootout victory over the Netherlands in March—and not tasted defeat after 90 minutes since March 2024. 

It was also flawless in both of its September internationals—beating Bulgaria 3-0 and Turkey 6-0—and it tops World Cup qualification Group E.

It should be a fairly serene path to the global showcase, allowing manager Luis de la Fuente the opportunity to test players and systems ahead of a tournament in which Spain will be hot favorites.

More La Masia success

Barcelona's Under-18s are celebrating after winning the Youth Club World Cup by beating Racing de Avellaneda 1-0 in the final thanks to a wonderful goal.

The winning goal came from Ukranian forward Artem Rybak with just 10 minutes remaining and was certainly worth waiting for as it was a brilliant team effort.

The first half had been a tense affair with Racing forcing Barcelona goalkeeper Gerard Sala into an impressive save to preserve his clean sheet.

Yet the Catalans slowly grew into the game and began to dominate after the break. Rybak was then sent on with 20 minutes left to play and grabbed the winning goal to enhance his growing reputation.

The win continues another fantastic year for La Masia and brings another trophy to the club.

Barca also won the UEFA Youth League last season, while the first team continues to see plenty of young graduates in the first team such as Lamine Yamal, Pau Cubarsi and more recently Dro Fernandez.

On Day 1 of a presale drawing for tickets to the FIFA World Cup next June, the process did not go smoothly for many.

A window officially opened Wednesday morning for soccer fans to enter a drawing for a chance to buy World Cup 26 tickets. The Visa Presale Draw is scheduled to run until 8 a.m. Friday, Sept. 19.

But hours after it opened Wednesday, in the scramble to get those coveted tickets, people trying to be among the first in line hadn't even made it to the ticket-buying moment. World Cup organizers told them to be patient, it will take some time.

Soccer fan Florian Ederer talked about his first attempt to score tickets.

"I'm currently in a waiting room, to join a queue to enter the presale draw to determine my eligibility to maybe buy a ticket at a later date," Ederer told NBC Bay Area.

With matches in 16 cities, including at Santa Clara's Levi's Stadium, and fans expected from nearly every country on Earth, World Cup officials say it's a drawn-out process.



"We know a lot of fans have been excited about this opportunity to start buying tickets … it's not all happening in one day," organizers said.

Indeed, there are nine more days left in the presale entry window. After it closes, emails will go out on Sept. 29 about the selection process, giving people dates and times to buy tickets.

World Cup ticket prices will range from $60 to nearly $7,000 per seat.

The National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) has long been the obvious destination for investors looking to align themselves with the growth of women's soccer.

Until about 2022, the league offered attractive franchise fees, between $1 million and $2 million, and a straightforward regulatory framework common in the U.S. sports ecosystem. Add the built-in audience that the U.S. women's national team established with its World Cup successes, and the league was an investors' paradise. However, the NWSL is no longer alone in its investment—and that's a good thing.

Its surge began when Michele Kang reset the market with her $35 million takeover of the Washington Spirit at the end of March 2022.

From there, 2023 became a defining year for the league. Expansion side Bay FC brought in global investment firm Sixth Street Partners, paying a then-record $53 million franchise fee. Soon after, Chicago Cubs co-owner Laura Ricketts led a group that acquired the Chicago Red Stars (now just Stars) for $60 million. A few months later, the San Diego Wave was sold to the Levine Leichtman Family Office for $120 million, which was briefly a league record. That mark didn't last long as Willow Bay and Bob Iger soon shattered it, paying $250 million to take control of Angel City FC in 2024.

Expansion fees, once pocket change for some of the new investors in the league, now hover around $110 million as they did for NWSL's newest team, Denver Summit FC—and that's before factoring in the cost of building a stadium and securing training facilities.

“There is nothing, systemically or otherwise, that would stand in the way of our valuations continuing to grow the way that men's valuations have grown in traditional sports,” NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman told CNBC's Alex Sherman recently. “If you spoke with (Angel City and Chelsea Women's investor) Alexis Ohanian, you know that his thesis is that this sport will reach a billion-dollar valuation before any other could or would in the short trajectory of our growth thus far.”

That clarity of ambition is admirable, but it also created an inevitable market dynamic: not everyone can afford to play here. So they look elsewhere.

In 2023, Mercury 13, an American investment firm focused on women's football and one of those groups to look outside the U.S., entered into exclusive talks to acquire lower-division English club Lewes FC, but ended up pulling out. The following year, the group made its first acquisition by buying a controlling stake in FC Como Women, which competes in Italy's top-tier women's soccer league, Serie A Femminile.

“In terms of the market itself, two years ago, when I started this company, the landscape was very different, and the conversations were very different. We would speak to most Premier League clubs, and they would view the women's team as, in a way, a distraction or a cost center,” Victoire Cogevina Reynal, the co-founder of Mercury 13, told The Athletic.

“If we could do this in partnership with the men's sides back then, I think we would have been able to do a lot more deals.”

Two years later, the market has adjusted, and most English clubs have realized that their women's teams have more value than what they were offering.

When Angel City FC investor and former Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian announced he was buying a minority stake in Chelsea Women earlier this year, his eight percent stake valued the English club at £245 million ($326 million). Part of what made that deal possible was Chelsea's owners splitting their women's team from their men's and selling a minority stake.

US-based private equity firm Clearlake Capital and American billionaire Todd Boehly co-owns Chelsea FC and recently sold that stake in their women's team to a company owned by Clearlake Capital and American billionaire Todd Boehly. Other Premier League teams have followed, carving their women's teams out from the men's side to commercialize them separately, including Aston Villa and Everton FC.

“There's been a bit of a freeze in the market where all the clubs are having conversations with all of these investors coming into Europe, but not necessarily pulling the trigger on any one transaction,” Cogevina Reynal explained. “And if they were pulling the trigger, they are only doing it for minority stakes, which is what Alexis did with Chelsea.”

Existing American ownership on the men's side has made investors more keen on investing in Europe. On the men's side, American investors have steadily taken over European soccer, with estimates suggesting that nearly half of the clubs across England's top three men's divisions are now U.S.-owned. The influx of capital reflects the deep pockets and ambition of these buyers, who have been looking for opportunities in global football, especially in the Premier League, which broke free from the Football Association (FA), the governing body of English football in 1992, to form a commercially independent league to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. Eventually, it became the most commercially successful football league in the world.

“There is definitely interest on the buy side,” Joel Cohen, Sportsology Group's head of advisory, told The Athletic. “More dedicated investment vehicles and multiclubs are on the rise in both the U.S. and Europe. There is also the macros trend at play, which is the scarcity of the asset-branded club in Europe and closed league in the US, combined with investors looking for diversified opportunities. As you go down the league, it's more accessible, but also the risk is higher.”

The Women's Super League (WSL), where Chelsea plays in England, has been charting its own course toward building a more financially secure league as well.

In November 2023, the WSL and Women's Championship clubs voted unanimously to spin off from the FA — similar to the Premier League — and established the Women's Professional Leagues Limited (WPLL), with Nikki Doucet as CEO. The WPLL was later rebranded to WSL Football in May 2025. In June 2025, the league announced it would expand from 12 to 14 clubs for the 2026–27 season. To make room, the 2025–26 campaign will promote two teams from the second tier while relegating just one through a new playoff system.

“We have a large, growing fanbase and the best global collection of football athletes in the world. Despite Chelsea's recent league dominance, our league offers attacking football and competitive matches, and the high-performance environments and minimum standards we have put in place means that the best players in the world want to play here,” Doucet told The Athletic when asked what makes WSL an attractive asset for investors today. “Couple that with the halo effect created by the Lionesses and the Premier League brands, we are fortunate to work alongside the independent women's clubs. We are an interesting proposition, and our governance is structured to enable sustainable growth.”

But running a European club comes with steep challenges: the constant threat of relegation, wildly different market structures, and complex regulatory environments. Still, as the popularity of the sport grows, data shows that despite regulatory difficulties and risk, women's teams are still solid properties.

According to a June report from Deloitte's Sports Business Group, revenues for Women's Super League (WSL) clubs in England soared by 34 percent during the 2023-24 season. While the 12 teams were tied to the men's side at the time of the investigation, they reported revenues separately and amassed a combined revenue of £65 million (from £48 million), with each club generating more than £1 million for the first time.

The revenue increases were largely driven by four clubs: Arsenal (£15.3m), Chelsea (£11.5m), Manchester United (£9.2m) and Manchester City (£6.6m), accounting for two-thirds of the money made across the league. The report found that matchday revenue increased by 73 percent, up to £12m, driven by a 31 percent increase in average league attendance.

The WSL is also experiencing a surge in attendance since the country hosted the 2022 UEFA Women's European Championship, including a sold-out final at Wembley Stadium. Last season, Arsenal Women packed more than 60,000 fans into the Emirates, multiple times.

While Deloitte's report flagged that average attendances in the WSL slipped by 10 percent last season compared with the year prior, it's not a dramatic collapse, and the league is aware of these signs and has undergone a significant restructuring to operate as an independent entity. 

The league's new domestic broadcasting deal is another good sign for investors, who benchmark Premier League's valuations to its lucrative broadcasting deals. And this season, the WSL's official YouTube channel gained almost 40 million views, making it the second-most-watched women's sports property on the platform globally, after WTA tennis.

While the league's U.S. broadcast deal for this season came together at the eleventh hour and wasn't officially announced before Chelsea's opener against Manchester City on Friday, the extension agreement with ESPN aims to capture American eyeballs tuning in to see U.S. stars like Emily Fox, Catarina Macario, and Alyssa Thompson. But the real fandom lies within these clubs' loyal fanbases.

“You are buying into a team that has an established fan base,” Cohen said. “In England in particular, a lot of people support their team and fans turn up to anything the club is associated with because they have love and passion for the club already.”

Despite attractive entry price points (Ohanian only paid £20 million for his 8 percent stake) with potential upside thanks to England's historic football culture, investors eyeing these clubs still need to figure out how they can turn women's teams into standalone properties with loyal fanbases similar to the NWSL's Kansas City Current or ACFC in a less commercially developed market.

“I'd say the main challenge at the moment, though, is profitability,” Cohen said. “The WSL teams are in a growth stage and that requires investment. Most of these teams are losing five to 10 million a year, and it's being funded mainly from the men's side.”

The next five years are likely to be a defining period for both leagues. If the NWSL hits an even higher valuation, its strategy of exclusivity will look even more prescient. But if investor demand outpaces supply and more Americans shift capital abroad, the U.S. may risk ceding first-mover advantage in women's soccer to WSL and the rest of Europe.

However, Doucet thinks both leagues can successfully co-exist from an investment perspective.

“We are at different development stages, and we are a different asset class with different risk profiles for capital,” Doucet said. “We are in different markets and play at different times of the year. We want a vibrant women's football ecosystem and NWSL contributes to that.”

 Matteo Berrettini is ready and raring to go for the 2025 Asian swing. 

 After nearly two and a half months without competing due to injury, the former No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings on Wednesday confirmed he will compete at the upcoming Lynk & Co Hangzhou Open, a hard-court ATP 250 that begins on 17 September. 

 “Final prep ✅ See you in Hangzhou! 🇨🇳 🔨🤼‍♂️”, wrote Berrettini in an Instagram post that included video of him training on court. 



 Berrettini is 13-11 for the 2025 season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, a tally that included Top 10 wins against Novak Djokovic in Doha in February and Alexander Zverev in Monte-Carlo in April. In his most recent competitive outing, the 29-year-old fell to Kamil Majchrzak in five sets in the first round at Wimbledon, and he then missed the entire North American hard-court swing due to injury. 

 Berrettini will join his fellow former Top 10 stars Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev in the Hangzhou draw. Hometown favourite Wu Yibing and the in-form Alexander Bublik will also compete in Zhejiang province, while Marin Cilic is the defending champion.

Race Recap: Italy

The Cooldown Room: Fact or fiction with Pietro Fittipaldi

It is not a victory or even a podium finish that Fernando Alonso would choose as his greatest Formula 1 race...

Fernando Alonso has shared the untold story behind what he believes to be his best drive in Formula 1 up to this point, picking out an “anonymous” performance at the Malaysian Grand Prix a decade-and-a-half ago.

Alonso is the most experienced driver on the F1 grid, having made his debut back in 2001 and racked up 417 starts so far – scoring more than 2,300 points, 106 podium finishes, 32 wins, 22 pole positions and two world titles as of the 2025 Italian Grand Prix.

However, rather than any of those successes topping his list of greatest races across that period, the 44-year-old Spaniard would go back to the early-2010s and a particularly challenging Sunday afternoon with Ferrari.

Speaking in an interview with Maaden, a partner of his current team Aston Martin, Alonso instead made reference to the 2010 Malaysian Grand Prix, where race-long gearbox and clutch issues blighted his efforts to recover from 19th on the grid (following a shock Q1 exit amid changeable weather conditions).

“There are many races that people were not maybe aware of,” said Alonso, reasoning why he did not choose one of his legendary wins, such as the 2012 European Grand Prix in Valencia, which saw him charge from 11th to the top step of the podium.

“It was Malaysia, Sepang [in 2010], where I had a problem on the gearshift. The gearbox was broken, semi-broken, the clutch had a problem – the gears went up okay, but not down.

“Around halfway through the race I tried to downshift into Turn 1 and from seventh [gear] I went to only fifth instead of second, so I did Turn 1 in fifth, I lost time, and I realised in the following corner that there was a problem.

“Out of desperation, I tried to blip the throttle on a downshift, because if not I would retire the car in that lap. I blipped the throttle and the downshift went in, so on the next braking point I blipped the throttle four times and four downshifts [happened].

“I communicated to the team, ‘What I'm doing is right or wrong? I will break the gearbox within one lap?' They said, ‘Keep doing what you're doing, the gearbox is safe by doing that'.

“I did like 30 laps like that, so the upshift was okay, then braking I had to brake and, while having the pressure on the brake pedal, I had to blip the throttle a couple of times to do the downshifts that I wanted – obviously synchronising the throttle and the paddle shift.”

An engine failure a couple of laps from the chequered flag left Alonso 13th in the overall classification, without a point to his name, but even today he takes great pride from the performance he was able to deliver while managing so many issues.

“The engineers said [after the race], ‘I don't know [how] you came [up] with that solution that fast, because that could be a solution, but you did it like in 13 or 14 seconds, the second corner after you had a problem',” added Alonso. “I said, ‘I hate losing, I hate retiring the car, I will try everything before accepting that we have to DNF'.

“[It was] completely anonymous, no one will remember that race, but the level of energy that I had to put [into] that race, the level of concentration, focus, and [to] instinctively come out with a solution [to] a problem that was never tested or experienced… I think it was quite a race to remember.”

Race Recap: Italy

The Cooldown Room: Fact or fiction with Pietro Fittipaldi

Kick Sauber driver Gabriel Bortoleto is this week's guest on the Beyond The Grid podcast.

Aged 11, Gabriel Bortoleto left Brazil, determined to make it in motorsport. His family's passion, hard work and sacrifice gave him a start.

His talent saw him accelerate towards a racing career. A two-time World Champion saw he was special, and helped guide him to Formula 1.

Speaking to Beyond The Grid host Tom Clarkson, Bortoleto looks back at his childhood, how his parents worked hard to fund his racing dream, how he made the difficult decision to leave them behind and go to Europe to further his career, and why Fernando Alonso's support was essential as he climbed the racing ladder.

Winning the Formula 3 and Formula 2 championship titles earned Bortoleto a place in F1. He explains how he is adjusting to the driving and living in the World Championship, the pride he feels representing Brazil, and what racing against experienced team mate Nico Hulkenberg is teaching him.

The Kick Sauber driver also reflects on how his manager and on-track rival Alonso continues to help him, and why he spends hours on his home simulator immediately after every race weekend.

In 2013, filmmaker Steven Soderbergh declared that he was retiring. Fans were aghast, but citing the “absolutely horrible” treatment of directors, and claiming that “films don't matter” any longer, he said he was going to concentrate on being a full-time painter. It's difficult not to see some of this type of haughty, self-loathing behavior in the central character of the definitely-not-retired Soderbergh's The Christophers which is, remarkably, his third film of 2025. Moving from full retirement to the production of several long-gestating works is a central plot point, and only makes the pleasures found in appreciating the metatextual connections to the director's artistic life deeper.

The Christophers revolves around reclusive artist Julian Sklar, played with exquisite wit and care by Ian McKellen. If the film was nothing but simply a showcase of his immense talent to prance around half-naked in a robe, shouting out insults and melancholically raging about his diminishing abilities, it certainly would be enough. But there is also a plot, which centers on Sklar's gormless children wishing to amplify an inheritance of which they've mostly been left out. A series of Sklar's unfinished paintings are to be surreptitiously completed by an expert restorer using the brushes and paints from Sklar's studio, essentially creating new works worth millions that could be pocketed by the kids.

These cartoonishly evil kids, Barnaby and Sallie, are played by James Corden and Jessica Gunning, and their delightfully vapid machinations provide The Christophers with some of its broadest comedic moments. The restorer in question, sent in under the guise of being Sklar's new assistant, is Lori Butler, played with a quiet grace and intense stare by Michaela Coel. As McKellen throws his tantrums, she watches with bright eyes and pursed mouth—the gaze of an acute observer. It's a difficult balance, to appear silently active rather than passive during these bouts of abuse from the elderly artist.

There's little in screenwriter Ed Solomon's blockbuster filmography that would lead one to believe he'd have a delicious little chamber piece in him, but gifted writers can surprise at any stage of their careers. Still, the jump from the likes of Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure, Men In Black, and Now You See Me to this far more intimate drama does feel unexpected. Yet what ties all those projects together are exceptionally realized characters in extreme circumstances, their wit and humanity shining through no matter what is transpiring around them.

It's that continued feature that makes The Christophers like one of Solomon's larger pieces stripped down to its foundational elements, minimizing the space and the stakes, and focusing on a quartet as their various modes of manipulation interweave. Soderbergh, along with his long-time cinematographer “Peter Andrews” (a.k.a., Steven Soderbergh himself), captures the Camden Town locale with an almost documentary-like aesthetic—one amplified by a design team that's filled Sklar's side-by-side townhomes with a symphony of detritus. It sings of untold stories of the past, with everything from the scratches on the front door, the crowded attic, and the layers upon layers of brushstrokes on the studio walls making the setting feel entirely lived-in. The film takes advantage of being set in this single location, the nooks and crannies of the studio resonating with unearthed memories, the crooked lines of the cluttered shelves as angular as the banter between the artist and his assistant/forger.

That playfulness is balanced and complicated by the profound sadness behind Sklar's irascibility. The Christophers is an old man's film, to be sure, but the notions of loss and regret are shared in deeply empathetic ways by Lori's own journey. Their shattered confidences echo on another, and while the broken pieces can't be fully reformed into something new and beautiful, kintsugi-like, much can be gleaned from simply refusing to suffer in silence alone.

The Christophers lacks the bombast of many of Solomon's other projects; it's a slightly small film even for Soderbergh. Yet there are grander ideas at play than might at first appear at first blush, and the excellent casting of McKellen elevates any momentary veer towards cliché into something approaching the epic. Arty, accessible, profound, and profane, The Christophers reminds audiences of what a gifted storyteller Soderbergh can be, and how his threats to quit are to be dismissed as nothing more than the passing tempers of an artist looking for a bit of attention—one deflecting from the ever-increasing challenge of remaining relevant. But he need not have worried; The Christophers proves Soderbergh has plenty of paint still waiting to be placed on the canvas.

Carrie Underwood is taking us to church! Literally!

When you live in Nashville, you never know who might be leading worship at your church on a given Sunday. At least, that's true for members of Rolling Hills Community Church in the Nashville suburb of Franklin.

Thrive Worship put up an Instagram video of none other than Carrie Underwood on stage at the church, belting out the band's “Pour Your Spirit Out,” backed by a large group of worship leaders.

The “American Idol” judge sang the lyrics, “Just believe that it can happen / There's a miracle right behind that stone / Roll back that stone / He's been waiting can you hear it / He's been knock knock knocking / Roll back that stone / Roll back that stone / Just like Lazarus out of that grave / Our God re-writes history / Jesus you change everything / When you pour your spirit out.”

In the Instagram post's, Thrive Worship wrote, “Is this real life?? We are so thankful to see how God is using this song in His church. What an honor ❤️” The video has a caption over it that reads, “POV: Carrie Underwood leading worship with a song you wrote. 😭🙌”

A post shared by Thrive Worship (@thrive_worship)

According to Taste of Country, Carrie Underwood does not lead worship at Rolling Hills on a regular basis.

But this isn't the first time she's taken the stage and surprised fellow church members. A year ago August, Carrie sang the Bethel Music song “Goodness of God” for the congregation. 

Bethel posted a video of the performance on its Instagram account, writing, “Carrie lead worship @rollinghillscommunity church this morning. This was a sweet surprise and it blessed me so much. It's amazing to hear her sing about God as her passion is very evident. I love this @bethelmusic song!”

And this past Christmas, Carrie got up on stage at Rolling Hills once again to sing “O Holy Night.”

A guest in the audience posted a video of her on TikTok, writing, “We were invited to a Christmas Concert by my husband's co worker and got a special treat to hear Carrie Underwood do a couple of songs,” she wrote. “It wasn't announced she would be there, so we were surprised. She is so talented. The entire group of the church choirs were outstanding.”

The “Jesus Take the Wheel” singer has never been shy about incorporating her deep faith into her music.

Carrie Underwood even put out a gospel album titled “My Savior” in 2021.

The album got nominated for both a Grammy Award for Best Roots Gospel Album and Top Christian Album at the Billboard Music Awards in 2022.

The album includes 13 gospel songs and classic hymns like “How Great Thou Art,” “Blessed Assurance,” “Amazing Grace,” and “Victory in Jesus.”  

Carrie also sang “How Great Thou Art” on American Idol during their “Songs of Faith” night.

	A24's R-rated Dwayne Johnson movie The Smashing Machine arrived on three week tracking looking quite buff this AM with an outlook around $20 million when it hits theaters on Oct. 3. 


	Johnson stars opposite Emily Blunt in a story about mixed-martial arts and UFC champion, Mark Kerr. The  pic's world premiere notched a 15 minute-plus standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival which brought Johnson to tears. The pic's director, Benny Safdie, also won the Silver Lion Best Director at the festival. Following the pic's North American premiere at TIFF, reviews on Rotten Tomatoes stand at 80% fresh with Deadline's own Damon Wise exclaiming, “Dwayne Johnson owns the whole thing with his truly remarkable work as fighter Mark Kerr, disappearing so fully underneath Kazu Hiru's astonishing prosthetics.”

Smashing Machine‘s first choice is best with men over 25, followed by women over 25 (a serious component of Johnson's fanbase). Overall first choice is ahead of A24's Civil War, the studio's record stateside opener at $25.5M. Should Smashing Machine‘s projection hold, it will rank as A24's second highest debut ever at the domestic B.O. First choice is also quite close to that of 2023's Killers of the Flower Moon from director Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio; that movie opening to $23.2M during the actors strike when the cast couldn't promote. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Should Smashing Machine hit its forecast, it will also be on par to another R-rated serious title that Johnson starred in back in 2013, Pain and Gain, opposite Mark Wahlberg. That movie, which followed Florida drug-taking bodybuilders immersed in an extortion ring, opened to $20.2M and finaled at $49.8M domestic and $87.3M global. 

	











Smashing Machine precedes the next big tentpole of the fall, Disney's Tron: Ares on Oct. 10. Also going wide on Oct. 3 is IFC's horror movie Good Boy and Bleecker Street's erotic thriller, Bone Lake.

Damon Albarn has officially announced the first new Gorillaz album since 2023. The follow-up to Cracker Island is called The Mountain, and it's out March 20 via the band's own new label, Kong. Leading the 15-track release is a song featuring Sparks titled “Happy Dictator.” Listen to the new single below.

The Mountain was produced by Gorillaz, James Ford, Samuel Egglenton, and Remi Kabaka Jr., with additional contributions from Argentine producer Bizarrap. The album was recorded at Albarn's Studio 13, in London, as well as his studio in Devon, England, and locations in Mumbai, New Delhi, Rajasthan, and Varanasi, India; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; Damascus, Syria; Los Angeles; Miami; and New York.

As is often the case with Gorillaz albums, The Mountain is filled with guests, and, this time, artists are performing in five languages: Arabic, English, Hindi, Spanish, and Yoruba. Contributors to the new album include Idles, Kara Jackson, Yasiin Bey, Johnny Marr of the Smiths, Black Thought of the Roots, Anoushka Shankar, and Omar Souleyman. Additionally, the album includes the voices of a number of deceased figures, including Bobby Womack, Dave “Trugoy the Dove” Jolicoeur, actor Dennis Hopper, the Fall's Mark E. Smith, Detroit rapper Proof, and Tony Allen. See the tracklist for The Mountain below.

Gorillaz will follow The Mountain with a tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland. See those dates below.

South Park has always been indiscriminate with its satirical targets, but the current season has been especially ruthless in taunting President Donald Trump and the MAGA crowd. In an unfortunate coincidence of timing, one episode that parodied right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk was scheduled to air a rerun on Wednesday September 10, the same day Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University. In wake of the shooting, the rerun was pulled from the schedule and another South Park episode aired on Comedy Central instead.

“Got A Nut” originally aired in August, and featured Cartman styling himself after Kirk and arguing politics with young people. “I have my arguments down rock solid,” Cartman tells his mother in the episode (via The Daily Beast). “These young college girls are totally unprepared, so I can just destroy them, and also edit out all the ones that actually argue back well. It just feels so good.” At the end of the episode, Cartman receives the “Charlie Kirk Award for Young Masterdebaters.”



Kirk, who became a right-wing celebrity for promoting racist, sexist, and extreme conservative rhetoric, celebrated the South Park parody at the time. He called it “hilarious,” saying on TikTok (via The Hollywood Reporter), “We have a good spirit about being made fun of. This is all a win. We as conservatives have thick skin, not thin skin, and you can make fun of us and it doesn't matter.” Unlike the White House and secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem, Kirk was able to spin South Park‘s attention into a positive. He called it a “badge of honor” and told Fox News (via The Independent) that it “goes to show the cultural impact and the resonance that our movement has been able to achieve.”

Not all within his movement would agree, and after his death some have blamed South Park for the shocking political violence. According to The New York Post, a staffer from Kirk's Turning Point USA posted on Telegram, “Comedy has consequences. Charlie was targeted in the culture before he was targeted in real life.” Similarly, right-wing radio host Jesse Kelly said on his program, “South Park thought it was funny to turn Charlie into a cartoon joke. Now his wife is planning a funeral.”

In the wake of the assassination of conservative media personality Charlie Kirk, Comedy Central has elected not to re-air an episode of the latest season of “South Park” that poked fun at Kirk.

The episode — titled “Got a Nut” — aired back on August 6 and was scheduled to air a re-run on Wednesday night, but the cable network owned by Paramount and Skydance pulled the episode after Kirk was fatally shot while speaking at Utah Valley University on Wednesday. The episode remains available for streaming on Paramount+. 

Some conservatives, including at least one at Kirk's Turning Point USA, wrote on Telegram (via the New York Post), “Comedy has consequences. Charlie was targeted in the culture before he was targeted in real life.” Other right-wing figures have directed blame at “South Park” for the disturbing act of political violence as well.

But Kirk himself was a fan of the episode after it aired, calling it “hilarious,” and saying he could tell “South Park” creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker had been watching some episodes of his show. You can watch his reaction via TikTok. 

 










“Our ‘Prove Me Wrongs,' our viral, cultural domination on primetime on Comedy Central. So impactful, so important, that ‘South Park' is highlighting it,” Kirk said. He went on to refer to a Bible verse, of which he said the show “gets this right,” and showed a clip in which Cartman, with a haircut to resemble Kirk's own, becomes a “master debater” and fires back at a weepy college student…all while he's sitting on the toilet with his laptop.

“There's going to be a lot said about this, but we need to have a good spirit about being made fun of. This is all a success, this is all a win. We as conservatives, we have thick skin, not thin skin, and you can make fun of us, and it doesn't matter,” Kirk said. “And until next time, I hope all of you become master debaters for truth,” with Kirk making sure he clearly pronounced each of those separate words in “master debaters.” 

The episode also showcased “The Charlie Kirk Awards” celebrating young people who have been “furiously master debating” and are using “master debation” to save America. The episode shows Cartman effectively becoming Kirk after he realizes another kid at school, Clyde, is very casually getting a huge following doing simple Prove Me Wrong videos, effectively stealing what has become Eric Cartman's calling card for the past 25+ years of television. 

 










This season of “South Park” has been all over the MAGA crowd, and its lampooning of Kirk was arguably tame in comparison to how it has depicted President Trump and the Trump administration's Kristi Noem in the same episode as Kirk. The episode saw Noem repeatedly shooting dogs in the face in a reference to Noem admitting in her book that she had shot and killed her 14-month-old dog. The show has also frequently shown Trump stripping down naked, mocking what they say is his small penis, and even showed an AI-generated Trump stumbling naked through the desert like a wandering messiah. While Kirk won't be the subject of the show's satire any further, don't expect Matt and Trey to hold back on others moving forward. 

“South Park” airs on Wednesdays on Comedy Central.

The complicated divorce between actor Scott Wolf, 57, and life coach Kelley Wolf, 48, took another surprising turn on September 10, 2025, as both parties arrived at a Utah courthouse for an emergency hearing — but Kelley showed up without legal representation, according to People. 

Scott, whose most recent starring roles have been in FOX's “Doc” and Hallmark's “A Merry Scottish Christmas,” attended the hearing with his lawyer, Bart Johnson, per Us Weekly, hoping the judge would put a full restraining order in place. 

Because Kelley did not have a lawyer present, the judge did not rule on any new matters and also ordered that Scott must help pay for a new lawyer for Kelley, Us Weekly reported.  

Since announcing their divorce on June 10, Kelley has been placed under two involuntary holds and struggled to follow court orders upon release, ignoring a social media gag order and boundaries set around communication with and about Scott and their three kids — ages 16, 12, and 11. Scott was awarded temporary sole custody of the kids in late June. 

During the September 10 hearing, according to People, the judge upheld parts of a protective order that had been in place since August 28. The order says Kelley cannot have any direct or indirect contact with her children and must remain at least 300 feet away from Scott. 

The former couple can, however, now communicate via phone, a source told People, because the judge said that's what best for their kids. However, neither party is required to answer the other person's call or text. 

Scott will have to wait more than a month for additional resolution, with the next divorce hearing scheduled for October 23, People reported. 

Kelley must have a new lawyer by then, the judge said, and submit a letter from her attorney confirming he or she represents the former MTV star, per Us Weekly. According to court minutes reviewed by the outlet, the judge ordered that once Kelley secures a new lawyer, Scott must send money directly to the attorney to cover their retainer fees.  

Kelley's prior attorney, Farrah Spencer, withdrew her representation on August 19, according to Us Weekly. 

Kelley, who rose to fame on MTV's “The Real World: New Orleans” and “The Challenge,” was arrested on August 26 after posting Scott's cell phone number in her Instagram Stories amid a flurry of social media posts that concerned many fans. 

Kelley was charged with three misdemeanors, per People — one for electronic communications harassment and two charges of misdemeanor electronic disclosure of personal identifying information. Released after two days in jail on $5,000 bail, Kelley was ordered to attend a treatment program and told the judge on September 2 that she was “excited” to do so. She said at the time that she was checking in on September 12 for a month. 

People reported on September 7 that Kelley had already entered rehab. But then she left the program on September 9, the outlet reported, one day before the latest divorce hearing. The outlet said she was staying at a hotel. On Labor Day, according to TMZ, police escorted Kelley out of an Airbnb where she had overstayed her reservation.

Prime Video has given an official series green light to Bishop, an original thriller drama starring Joel Kinnaman. It comes from co-creators/executive producers Little Marvin (Them) and Tony Salzman (Dexter: Resurrection), Vertigo and Amazon MGM Studios.


	Kinnaman also headlines Apple TV+'s sci-fi drama series For All Mankind, whose upcoming fifth season is awaiting a premiere date. It is unclear whether he could do both shows. Apple TV+ has not said whether Season 5 of For All Mankind will be its last; the fate of Kinnaman's character on the alt-history space race drama is also unknown.

	In Bishop, homicide detective Bishop Graves (Kinnaman) – brilliant, battle-scarred – will put all of his skills to the test in the hunt for an elusive killer targeting San Francisco's moneyed class. As this increasingly audacious killer develops a devoted following among the city's powerless, Bishop becomes convinced these murders connect back to SF's most powerful man, his own father, Lincoln Graves.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The project got on the runway for a series order in late spring with Kinnaman as the choice for the title character. Over the summer, there were on and off conversations with an A-list actor for the Lincoln role, which ultimately fell through. 


	Little Marvin serves as showrunner of Bishop, which he and Saltzman executive produce alongside Vertigo's Roy Lee and Miri Yoon.


	The project stems from Little Marvin's overall deal at Amazon MGM Studios. It is his second pilot script under the pact following Them. Both have now gone to series. (The horror anthology drama Them ran for two seasons.)


	“Little Marvin and Tony Saltzman have created a truly electric crime drama,” Nick Pepper, Head of US SVOD TV & Development Series, Amazon MGM Studios, said. “We are thrilled to see Joel Kinnaman bring the titular Detective Bishop Graves to life. Paired with our outstanding collaborators Roy Lee and Miri Yoon from Vertigo, Bishop is poised to captivate and surprise our global Prime Video customers.”

	











The Killing, Altered Carbon and House of Cards alum Kinnaman also is set to star opposite Elisabeth Moss and Kerry Washington in the upcoming Apple TV+ limited series Imperfect Women. He is repped by WME and Magnolia Entertainment.


	Saltzman was a writer-producer on Little Marvin's Them and also worked on Dexter: New Blood. He is repped by Kaplan/Perrone and Miles Metcoff at Yorn Levine. Little Marvin is repped by WME, Blue Marble Management and Lichter Grossman Nichols Adler. Vertigo is repped by CAA.

EXCLUSIVE: The long awaited third season of HBO‘s star-studded series Big Little Lies has taken a major step forward with the hire of Mr. & Mrs. Smith co-creator, executive producer and showrunner Francesca Sloane to write the first episode of Season 3, currently in development at the premium network, Deadline has learned. She will executive produce the new installment with series creator David. E. Kelley and stars Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman. It falls under an exclusive two-year overall deal Sloane has signed with HBO.


	Sloane is moving to HBO from Amazon MGM Studios where she had been under overall deals since 2020 and co-created with Donald Glover the breakout drama series Mr. & Mrs. Smith. She has served as executive producer and showrunner on the series, whose previously greenlighted second season has been delayed.

	











	The writer hire signals a likely double dose of good news for Big Little Lies fans. Casey Bloys, Chairman and CEO of HBO and HBO Max Content, said last fall that he and his team were waiting for Liane Moriarty's sequel book before moving forward with a third season of the hit thriller.


			Watch on Deadline		







	Moriarty's followup to her 2014 Big Little Lies novel, on which the Emmy-winning first season of the HBO series was based, is believed to be finished and will be published in 2026. She has revealed that it features a time jump with the women at the center of the story now moms of teenagers.


	The deal with Sloane caps an extensive search HBO launched this summer for a Big Little Liars Season 3 writer. It resulted in a bake-off among a half dozen established writers/writing teams.

	











	Sloane is not believed to have been part of that process. She had been set to return as showrunner for Season 2 of Mr. and Mrs. Smith and has spoken out about her love and commitment to the series. But with her latest Amazon MGM Studios deal coming to an end as Mr. & Mrs. Smith's second season was put on an indefinite hold over what I hear were cast issues, Sloane and the studio engaged in lengthy conversations about what her new pact would look like, sources said.


	Most overall deals these days are tied to a show, and with the one Sloane has been attached to at Amazon MGM Studios in limbo, the proposed financial terms are said to have been below her previous pact. 


	As a result, she opted to explore the marketplace, fielding a lot of interest, including from HBO for Big Little Lies, which led to her overall deal at the network.


Big Little Lies was a critical and ratings hit when it launched in 2017 as a limited series. A second season, based on original material, followed in 2019, with Kelley as writer/executive producer of both installments.


	News of BLL getting a third season first began percolating when Kidman let it slip in November 2023 that a continuation of the seaside-set crime drama was starting to come together at HBO. A couple of months prior, fellow BLL executive producer Bruna Papandrea told Deadline that there was an effort to continue the story but the sudden 2021 death of Big Little Lies executive producer/Season 1 director Jean-Marc Vallée was “a devastating blow” to everyone involved that left “a big hole” and “made us all pause.”


BLL stars Witherspoon, Kidman, Zoë Kravitz, Laura Dern and Shailene Woodley who all had spoken publicly about their desire to return for a third season, along with Kelley. The cast of the series also includes Alexander Skarsgård, Adam Scott, James Tupper, Jeffrey Nordling as well as Meryl Streep in Season 2. 


	The first season, about five Monterey, CA women embroiled in a homicide investigation, won 8 Emmy Awards out of 16 nominations, including Outstanding Limited Series, a directing award for Vallée and acting trophies for Kidman, Skarsgård, and Dern.


	Sloane and Glover shared in two Emmy nominations — Outstanding Drama Series and Writing for a Drama Series — and three WGA Award nominations for Season 1 of Mr. & Mrs. Smith, which earned a total of 16 Emmy noms, winning two categories, including Guest Actress In A Drama Series for Michaela Coel. 


	She previously worked on Glover's FX's Atlanta, Fargo and The First. Sloane began her career on the staff of Veena Sud's Seven Seconds and Startup. She is repped by WME, Sugar23 and Yorn Levine Barnes.

Who said all you need to make a movie is a girl and a gun? Evidently, all you may actually need is a roughly 400-mile road, a game cast of youngsters, and Mark Hamill, as director Francis Lawrence's latest hunger games, “The Long Walk,” is a grim and gripping late-summer treat coated in poison. It also helps that screenwriter JT Mollner (writer/director of last year's addictively twisted cast-and-mouse “Strange Darling“) has downed the material — a Stephen King, sorry, Richard Bachman-penned young-adult novel from 1979 — without a dose of saccharine hope. 

 










Ultimately, “The Long Walk” comes at its anti-totalitarian message with the subtlety of a point-blank kill. Adapted from the novel King wrote under a pseudonym to separate his writing from his by-then celebrity status, the dystopian thriller is set somewhere, some place, some time, in a post-Vietnam War middle America. In other words, a time that many who lived through that era and this one would say was the other worst time in American history, riven by panic and protest and government corruption laid bare.

In this particular world, as a rebuke of a supposed “epidemic of laziness” spreading across its youth culture, the Long Walk challenge is established as a kind of compulsory draft: Enlist yourself, survive an endless trek without going under 3 miles per hour, and unimaginable riches await you at the other end if you're the last one alive. Three warnings, and you're dead, but another hour advanced without going under the speed limit, and one warning gets erased. Meanwhile, Mark Hamill as The Major in aviator sunglasses is shouting at you with a megaphone to keep moving or else.

The calm presence of Cooper Hoffman is our guide on a movie that is literally just a group of determined, out-of-hope young men walking, save a couple flashbacks, here as Ray Garraty, #47. He has his own agenda, packed later into the movie with close-to-the-source-material reverence to reveal that Raymond is coming of age in a time of authoritarian government control and censorship. His father (Josh Hamilton) suffered a bad fate at the hands of the regime's squadron after introducing spreading illicit political messaging and introducing his kid to the likes of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, oh my, and later in the movie, Ray may appear to be quoting Heidegger in describing how our individual deaths are the one thing that make us unique to each other as humans.

 










The last-man-standing imperative of the Long Walk itself gets trickier for contestants to abide as they grow closer to one another. Ray especially bonds with Peter McVries aka #23 (David Jonsson, whose cocksure charisma reveals a softer side when the character is at one point implied to be queer), rattled by the graphic kill of the youngest contestant 20 minutes in, which is also when the film finally drops its title card. 

Then, there's a creepy, reedy Charlie Plummer doing his best Caleb Landry Jones as Gary, #5, who goads other players into shedding down to their weakest points to eliminate them. Yes, there are several visceral shots of a Long Walker or two getting the runs on the way to their moving target of a destination, though, like the blood spewing with each squadron's unloading into a slowpoke, it's thankfully (but perhaps cheaply) all done with CGI. Other contestants start dropping like flies, whether in emotional hysterics or foaming-at-the-mouth seizures from exhaustion or dehydration.

In the annals of movies about death races, “The Long Walk” is closest in misanthropic spirit to Sydney Pollack's shocking 1969 “They Shoot Horses, Don't They?,” with cinematographer Jo Willems applying a similar dustbowl aesthetic that tends toward the claustrophobic, intentional or otherwise. Shots tend to be in medium close-up, pitched in front of the walking men, without much innovation in angle or framing. This unfussy, even dusty atmosphere makes “The Long Walk” feel all the more realistic or plainly ordinary, a dystopia both backwards in time and close to our own.

 










“My dad was my hero,” Ray, who's left a widowed mother (Judy Greer) overwhelmed by grief back at home, tells Peter at one point. That notion, coming from Cooper Hoffman, of course brings to mind his own father, Philip Seymour Hoffman, giving the film an extratextual emotional dimension even as Cooper's performances are increasingly feeling like a far cry from his father's tortured, nervous souls and weirdos. Elsewhere in the ensemble, Joshua Odjick (“Wildhood”), Garrett Wareing (as Stebbins, with secrets of his own), and Tut Nyuot (“Small Axe”) also make a potent impression, arguing for “The Long Walk” as a kind of contemporary “Stand by Me” in terms of the proximity of coming of age to mortal danger.

This “Long Walk” indeed grows repetitive, its political message bluntly delivered in a finale that rewrites the book's ending and is here set so unsubtly to “America the Beautiful” that it makes the climactic shot of Brian De Palma's “Blow Out” look positively conservative by comparison. “The Long Walk” doesn't tell you or ask you anything new if you're feeling pent up with rage by American leadership these days, but the film's grim commitment to the bit is a rarity for a studio movie: There's no holding of your hand on this long walk, nor does it read you a bedtime story and tuck you in at the end.

 










“The Long Walk” opens in theaters from Lionsgate on Friday, September 12.

A scheduled repeat of a recent episode mocking Kirk has been pulled from Comedy Central's rotation, while some on the right are taking aim at the show.


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, some conservatives are pointing fingers at South Park for mocking the conservative thought leader in a recent episode. While Comedy Central pulled the same episode from a scheduled repeat Wednesday night and sources say the channel will not be airing the episode in its linear rotation for the immediate future (though as of Thursday morning, the episode was still currently available on streaming).


	The second episode of the current 27th season of Comedy Central's satirical hit — titled “Got a Nut” — had Eric Cartman becoming a right-wing podcaster and spouting tropes used by Kirk, who tours college campuses debating progressive students. “Who wants to debate the master debater?” demanded Cartman, who also took on Kirk's hairstyle and later attended a ceremony giving out “The Charlie Kirk Award for Young Masterdebaters.”

	The mockery was pretty tame by South Park standards (certainly kinder than its treatment of Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem in the same episode). After the episode aired, Kirk seemed thrilled and posted a TikTok (below) calling the episode “hilarious” and noted “South Park gets this right.” The Turning Point USA founder added, “We have a good spirit about being made fun of. This is all a win. We as conservatives have thick skin, not thin skin, and you can make fun of us and it doesn't matter.”


	But after Kirk's tragic murder at Utah Valley University while engaged in the same sort of college campus debate the episode poked fun of, some MAGA conservatives are blasting the show. 


	According to the New York Post, one Turning Point USA staffer posted on Telegram, “Comedy has consequences. Charlie was targeted in the culture before he was targeted in real life” and right-wing radio host Jesse Kelly told his listeners: “South Park thought it was funny to turn Charlie into a cartoon joke. Now his wife is planning a funeral.” 

	











The Daily Beast spotted some other comments on social media: “Let's blame South Park. Blame the media. Blame leftist rhetoric. These people hate you and want to see you dead.” And: “South Park certainly fomented the hatred necessary to get Kirk assassinated.” And: “[South Park creators] Trey Parker and Matt Stone are responsible for this.” While a popular account called Johnny MAGA dubbed South Park “monsters” for the episode.


	That said, many others on the right — perhaps even the majority — were quick to note they do not blame the series, so the impulse to bash the show has been far from universal. One “MAGA” labeled X account wrote, “I don't blame South Park. They aren't our leaders, representatives, mentors, pastors, example setters or societal caretakers. They are satire!”


	Comedy Central had no comment on yesterday's scrapped repeat, and the episode is still available on demand via Paramount+. Pulling episodes that unintentionally intersect with a violent real-life tragedy is a common practice as a respectful effort not to inflame or seemingly take advantage of a situation. A few other episodes of South Park have been permanently pulled from distribution over the years due to controversial content.


	On a Reddit thread about the episode being pulled, fans agreed not airing the episode was “the polite thing to do” while also concurring that South Park doesn't deserve blame for the real-life violence. “Probably a smart decision, no matter your feeling on him; don't give either side reason to exploit this,” wrote one. While another opined, “You really can't fault them for not predicting this; I don't think anyone could have predicted this series of events with him literally talking about gun violence as he was being shot.”

	











	Given South Park has been on a tear going after President Trump and MAGA this season, and frequently pivots at the last minute to tackle current events in their episodes, it will be interesting to see what creators Parker and Stone focus on when the show returns next week amid its new biweekly rollout schedule this season.


	Here was Kirk's reaction to the episode, which also features some clips that showed the show's mockery of his debate style: 




	The 31-year-old Kirk built a small conservative student group into America First — one of the most influential forces in Republican politics. Kirk was speaking at a debate Wednesday hosted by his nonprofit political organization. Immediately before the shooting, Kirk was taking questions for an audience member about mass shootings and gun violence. A single shot rang out and Kirk could be seen reaching for his neck with his right hand. The gunman is still at large. 


	“The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead,” President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social. “No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us. Melania and my Sympathies go out to his beautiful wife Erika, and family. Charlie, we love you!

Christy Martin's mom is a real piece of work. “Oh, Christy. You sound crazy,” the character, played by Merritt Wever, tells her daughter when she begs for help dealing with her abusive trainer-turned-husband, Jim (Ben Foster), in the trailer for David Michôd's Christy. While the Sydney Sweeney-led biopic chronicles the championship boxer's rise through the ranks, it also spotlights the adversity she faced outside of the ring. “If you leave me, I'll kill you,” Jim threatens as Christy reels from her mom's doubt, right before the trailer cuts to an image of a pink gun in Martin's drawer.

Pink, as the trailer establishes earlier, is Martin's signature color. Her outlook on the sport was similarly rosy when she got her start. “I think I found my thing,” she says over a triumphant training montage set to Stevie Nicks' “Edge Of Seventeen.” “I bet most people go their entire lives and they don't even know what their thing is.” The music and tone change drastically, however, as she gets pummeled by an opponent and accused by her husband of “sneaking around” behind his back. 



The synopsis of the David Michôd-directed film captures these high highs and low lows. “Christy Martin (Sweeney) never imagined life beyond her small-town roots in West Virginia—until she discovered a knack for punching people,” it reads (per IndieWire). “Fueled by grit, raw determination, and an unshakable desire to win, she charges into the world of boxing under the guidance of her trainer and manager-turned-husband, Jim (Foster). But while Christy flaunts a fiery persona in the ring, her toughest battles unfold outside it—confronting family, identity, and a relationship that just might become life-or-death. Based on remarkable true events, Christy Martin's story is one of resilience, courage, and the fight to reclaim one's life.”

Sweeney also praised the real Martin's resilience in an interview with IndieWire earlier this year. “Christy will forever be one of the most inspiring in my life,” she said. “She has faced such tremendous challenges inside and outside the ring, and her story inspired me beyond anything, and I cannot wait for other people to be inspired by her.”

Christy had its world premiere at TIFF earlier this month. It will be released in theaters November 7.

Benjamin Ayres is busy making magic again. The Hallmark Channel star kicked off September 2025 with his latest fundraiser for Romance University — the online community of Hallmark rom-com fans that he started on a whim in late 2022. The initiative has grown with each year, with fans connecting online and raising tens of thousands of dollars for various charities. 

This time, Ayres has teamed up with fellow Hallmark hunk Tyler Hynes to raffle the shirts off their backs, raising money for families impacted by cancer. With each raffle ticket costing just $10, Ayres told EntertainmentNow that the money raised will be divided between the Childhood Cancer Canada Foundation and Gilda's Club, started by late comedian Gilda Radner.

Among the items up for grabs in Romance University's raffle is the one-of-a-kind “World's Best Santa Trainer” sweater that Ayres wore in his 2024 movie “The Santa Class” — featuring his own face and working Christmas lights on the front. Meanwhile, Hynes has also donated a swanky suit from one of his recent movies. 

In addition to their one-of-a-kind movie wardrobe items, the raffle also includes signed items from Hynes (like his Boot Shot gift boxes and coffee table photo book), a bracelet handmade by actor and jewelry-maker Ryan Paevey, and an assortment of Romance University hoodies and gear. 

Raffle tickets are available for $10 each through September 12, 2025. Ayres said he will pull the winning tickets and announce the winners during an Instagram Live on September 15. 

Ayres, who will star in the 2025 movie “A Christmas Angel Match” with Meghan Ory, says his favorite part is delivering the checks personally to the organizations and thanking the volunteers for their important work. 

“So many people have been affected by cancer, whether themselves or somebody within their family or a close friend,” Ayres told EntertainmentNow. “I just feel so fortunate to have created something like Romance University, where people feel safe about donating money and trust that it's going to be sent to these places that need it.” 

A post shared by Romance University (@romance__university)

The two organizations that the raffle will benefit focus on helping cancer patients and their loved ones thrive, Ayres told EntertainmentNow. 

“What's so beautiful about it is that there's (the patient) that's affected with cancer, but then it's their family, too, privately processing that, and these organizations think about that,” Ayres said. 

When Romance University raised money in 2024 for the Childhood Cancer Canada Foundation, for instance, the funds helped them hold a retreat for families, explaining, “Everybody goes and hangs out and plays games and stuff like that. For those families to have support groups and speak to others, as somebody within their family is suffering, I just thought, ‘That's so beautiful and so amazing.'” 

“So I reached out to Ty,” Ayres said of the idea to raffle off clothing and other items, “and he was like, ‘I'll give away a suit. 100%. I love it.'”

The Romance University raffle tickets can be purchased online for $10 each through September 12.

EXCLUSIVE: The Bold & the Beautiful is setting a new milestone with the addition of Harrison Cone.


	The actor, whose credits include the feature films Ick and I Wish You All the Best, will join the CBS sudser as an aspiring designer who's in a relationship with Remy Pryce (Christian Weissmann). He will make his first appearance at Forrester Creations on Sept. 16.


	The addition of Cone will mark the first time that B&B has featured a gay male couple who will also kiss on-screen (another first for the sudser). Cone's character name is being kept under wraps because he has a close tie to one of the major B&B characters.

	In 2015, the soap made history by introducing Maya Avant (Karla Mosley) as the first regular transgender character in daytime television. Maya went on to become the first transgender bride in all of TV before her character was written off in 2019.


	There have been other gay male couples in daytime, including As the World Turns‘ Luke Snyder and Noah Maye, Days of Our Lives‘ Will Horton and Sonny Kiriakis. At present, CBS' Beyond the Gates has a popular interracial gay couple played by Brandon Claybon and Mike Manning.

Long before Benito Mussolini turns to the camera and says, “Make Italy great again” — speaking in English for the one and only time in Joe Wright's eight-hour limited series — it's clear whose name would precede “Son of the Century” if MUBI were to greenlight a 21st century installment. 

Of course, Donald Trump likely looms larger than other modern fascists for me, given my (increasingly embarrassing) American roots, but “Mussolini: Son of the Century‘s” chosen timeline maps its tyrant's rise to power so plainly onto that of the United States' wannabe-dictator, it's hard to argue coincidence. Fascism is on the rise everywhere, but this thrumming critique has its sight set on one particular blackshirt, and he's stained in orange.

Take, for instance, where the series begins: with Mussolini the “journalist” railing against socialism while crafting entertaining propaganda that furthers his own agenda. Sure, Trump “only” used television to fabricate his reputation as a brilliant businessman, rather than write Fox News chyrons first-hand, but media manipulation is still media manipulation, then and now, in print or on TV. A more explicit reference comes seconds later, when Mussolini (played with boisterous tenacity by Luca Marinelli) mocks his right-hand man for having “the smallest hands.” (“I can't imagine his cock,” Mussolini adds, speaking directly to the camera.) Then, still within 10 minutes of the first episode, a mob of fascists brutally batter a peaceful group of socialists.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






The ghastly scene sets up the series' ongoing central conflict (establishing the villains and heroes, if you will), and — even though “Son of the Century” was made long before right-wing media painted Zohran Mamdani as an existential threat to America — fascists and socialists tossing barbs at one another (or, more accurately, fascists tossing grenades and socialists shouting accusations of grenade-tossing) still brings the battle between 1920s Italian political parties roaring into 2020s New York City.

Mussolini actually used to be a socialist, even running their official newspaper before he was ousted as a warmonger and pivoted to fascism. When Mussolini explains it (directly to the camera again, as he so often does), fascism is a movement of contradictions: “We're not a party,” he says, “we're an anti-party.” They don't engage in politics because they're anti-politics, and the same goes for elections, the monarchy, and the church. “Fascism is everything,” Mussolini says, “and the opposite of everything.”

So… it's nothing. Accepting such ruthless adherence to victory without meaning is the foundation of Mussolini's movement — “Our only doctrine is action,” he says — so it's no wonder he steadily betrays each of his oppositional positions in order to move up the ranks. Anti-politics? Not if a little politicking brings him more power. Anti-elections? Not if he can win them (democratically or otherwise). Anti-monarchy? Not if he has a chance to be king. Anti-church? Who is God to a man like Mussolini, except another influence to be brought under his command?

 










If none of this brings Trump to mind, first of all, I envy you more than you could possibly imagine, and secondly, congratulations on your recent escape from that giant rock. Wright's limited series is a furious fever dream connecting the past to the present. Events span just over five years of Mussolini's life, ending right before his decades-long dictatorship formally starts, but they still cover his pivotal March on Rome (when Mussolini called for an “insurrection” instead of elections), the fascist party's infiltration of Parliament (“[They] think they've domesticated us, but they've only legalized us”), and multiple scenes foregrounding Mussolini's violent treatment of women. (He's shown raping a newspaper staffer, and his wife, Rachele, brags that their first time together was “by force.”)

Wright captures the madman's energy with his trademark kinetics. There are rear-projections of old newsreel footage cast against foregrounded black-and-white shots of his cast; iris ins and outs that emphasize Mussolini's isolating, irreparable ego, or reveal temporary relief via his throngs of admirers; ornate parties, rallies, and clashes filled with scores of extras and set within shadowy, palatial spaces; and, of course, there are extended tracking shots galore.

Marinelli — a two-time Best Actor winner at the Venice Film Festival (“Don't Be Bad,” “Martin Eden”) who Wright called “one of the greatest actors of his generation, if not the greatest actor of his generation” — is at the center of it all. His forceful speechifying is often captured from a low angle, positioning the viewer like Mussolini's awed front-row audience, but such formal assists are largely unnecessary when it comes to appreciating the character's gravity. From enunciation to intonation, gesticulation to cadence, he nails the propulsive rhythm of Wright's scenes (co-written by Stefano Bises and Davide Serino) and earns your attention without elevating Mussolini above the opportunistic, shitty little man he was. Marinelli's performance is well-measured, even when his character is hifalutin and brash.

 










Still, “Mussolini: Son of the Century” comes up short relating anything outside of Mussolini's point of view. We're so closely tied to the central character's perspective — he's in nearly every scene, he narrates his own story, and he sucks up all the oxygen by design — that it's impossible to see him how the public must have seen him then. He talks of casting “magic tricks” on Parliament and the proletariat alike, but we're simultaneously too far from the spectators to appreciate the illusion and too close to the magician to see anything but a liar.

The series also shares a common struggle with other tales of Trump when it comes to dissecting a psyche devoid of principles and meaning. “We fascists have no preconceived ideas,” Mussolini says, not long after he defines fascism as “the opposite of everything.” Hinging a lengthy biography on a person whose entire identity comes down to procuring power doesn't make for a dynamic portrait; it's a simple one, and “Son of the Century” does a fine job acknowledging as much. That's what makes fascists so dangerous, after all — they don't believe in anything, which makes them both unpredictable and ruthless — but it doesn't lend itself to a layered, developing narrative.

Mussolini will say anything and do anything to further his personal agenda, and his personal agenda amounts to hoarding power. There's nothing else to him — all bluster and no substance — and as honest as that characterization may be, it's dramatically inert. For as keenly as Wright's direction represents Mussolini's bombastic flash as the plot ticks off historical moment after historical moment, the story tied to them can feel repetitive, familiar, and hollow.

 










What that leaves is an eight-hour series with the emotional impact of watching the news. The message is valuable and urgent — no one's disputing the need to identify Nazis so Indiana Jones can immediately punch them in the mouth (figuratively speaking) — but the packaging of that message does little to deepen our understanding for or appreciation of the anti-fascist movement. Mussolini was Trump before Trump, and Trump is the modern Mussolini. OK. No argument here. What else ya got?

“Mussolini: Son of the Century” is now available on MUBI.

Political analyst Matthew Dowd has been fired from MSNBC after commenting on the shooting of conservative activist and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk on Wednesday, Variety reports. Dowd was on-air analyzing the breaking news when anchor Katy Tur asked him about “the environment in which a shooting like this happens.” “We don't know if this was a supporter shooting their gun off in celebration. So we have no idea about this,” Dowd responded. He continued: “He's been one of the most divisive, especially divisive younger figures in this, who is constantly sort of pushing this sort of hate speech or sort of aimed at certain groups. And I always go back to, hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions. And I think that is the environment we are in. You can't stop with these sort of awful thoughts you have and then saying these awful words and not expect awful actions to take place. And that's the unfortunate environment we are in.”

MSNBC president Rebecca Kutler apologized for Dowd's comments after they spread across social media. “During our breaking news coverage of the shooting of Charlie Kirk, Matthew Dowd made comments that were inappropriate, insensitive and unacceptable,” she wrote in a statement shared on MSNBC Public Relations' X account. “We apologize for his statements, as has he. There is no place for violence in America, political or otherwise.”

Dowd also issued his own apology on his Bluesky account. “My thoughts & prayers are w/ the family and friends of Charlie Kirk,” he wrote. “On an earlier appearance on MSNBC I was asked a question on the environment we are in. I apologize for my tone and words.  Let me be clear, I in no way intended for my comments to blame Kirk for this horrendous attack. Let us all come together and condemn violence of any kind.”

Kirk died as a result of the shooting, which took place on the campus of Utah Valley University. He was 31.

“Love + War,” the new documentary from “Free Solo” filmmakers Elizabeth Chai Vasarhely and Jimmy Chin, opens on footage that's become depressingly familiar in the past several years, of civilians caught up and brutalized by warfare. In this case, it's the city of Novoluhanske in Ukraine on February 19, 2022, right before Russia would invade the country and plunge it into bloodshed and chaos. From the start though, the focus of Vasarhely and Chin isn't on just the chaos of the invasion, but on one of the figures documenting it.

Clad in a protective helmet and a press jacket, photojournalist Lynsey Addario sticks out immediately as a great documentary character. She's serious about her work, wryly humorous at the right times despite the dire circumstances around her, and bluntly honest about her feelings — early on she complains to the camera while waiting in line with other press to survey the wreckage of an attack how the men are allowed in front while the women are frequently left to stay behind. Most importantly, Addario — a Pulitzer Prize winning photographer — is extremely good at her job, and through footage on the ground the documentary captures the events that led to her snapping a photo of Ukranian soldiers rushing to the dead bodies of a family hit and killed by Russian mortar fire during the invasion, which became one of the defining images of the conflict during its first few days.

As the title hints at, though, “Love + War” isn't exactly a film about Addario's career, at least not in its totality. Surveying her work in various countries that have come under conflict — primarily the Ukraine, but also Middle-Eastern countries during the War on Terror like Iraq and Afghanistan — Vasarhely and Chin are equally as interested in Addario's life outside of her career, and how it's impacted by the emotional and mental toll of the things she's seen and experienced. The result is a documentary that refreshingly avoids hagiographic pitfalls to make its lead less of a paragon of journalistic truth and integrity and more a full-formed, three-dimensional human. 

 










Chin and Vasarhely take plenty of time throughout the film to follow Addario's exemplary career, using her photos, interviews with people she's worked with, and often devestating footage of her on the ground recording the violence and atrocities she's witnessed to flesh out a portrait of her exemplary career. The film's heart, though, lies in its material in Addario's home in London, where she lives with former Reuters journalist Paul de Bendern and her two young sons. Bendern and Addario describe their relationship lovingly, but their domestic life is one Addario never imagined for herself given the work she does: in detail, the two discuss how she only came around to the idea of having kids after a near-death experience. And its clear how difficult it is for her to maintain a sense of normalcy at home when she's away for so long and experiences such harrowing circumstances. 

In these intimate scenes set at home, we see how Addario's work bleeds into her domestic space. One of her sons proves sullen and distant, while another regresses and begins wetting the bed. When asked to tell a bedtime story to one of her sons, you can see Addario's mind is elsewhere. In talking heads, she admits up that the place she's most present is in her work: “I feel like I'm home.” “Love + War” never judges her for it, giving her space to explain her passion for helping civilians and demonstrate the tenacity and grit that makes her so capable, but it doesn't judge her loved ones frustrations either. 

 










Along with Addario and her family — including her mother and sisters, who fill in details about her largely ordinary background growing up the daughter of two hairdressers in Connecticut — “Love + War” also features talking heads from across the journalistic field describing the work of war correspondents, addressing the gendered elephant in the room in how the field is typically seen and coded as male despite a long history of female war photographers. Others, like New Yorker writer Dexter Filkins, describe the toll that covering war has on reporters' personal lives, darkly joking about colleagues they know 

Occasionally, “Love + War” does suffer from a sense of only skimming the surface of Addario's life and complexity. A recounting of a particularly harrowing moment in her career where she was captured in Libya that serves as the film's emotional climax proves oddly impersonal and distant, with Chin and Vasarhely never quite making the emotions revisiting the incident dredges up feel real or immediate. But on its whole, it's a smart, compelling documentary, one that sticks out by making its lead refreshingly, vulnerably human. 

“Love + War” premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. National Geographic will release the film at a later date.

When Strange New Worlds began, it had a clear vision: tell episodic adventure stories with strong, serialized emotional arcs for its central characters. And the first season excelled at that mission. Uhura's newbie experience as a cadet, Spock's engagement to T'Pring, La'An's Gorn trauma, and, above all, Pike's newfound awareness of his violent future gave the show an emotional spine as it hopped from planet to planet. It was okay if the episodic plots were a little basic because the emotional through-lines brought the real depth to the series. 

Ever since Pike made peace with his future in the season-one finale, however, the show has struggled to recapture the same balance. Season two introduced some new emotional through-lines, like the La'An/Kirk flirtation and Spock/Chapel breaking the seal on their will-they/won't-they dynamic. But the show shifted toward high-concept one-offs like the musical episode and the Lower Decks crossover. Individually, the episodes in season two were probably stronger than they were in season one. But the overall season felt more disparate and less cohesive. 

To its credit, season three has tried to find a new balance. Where season two zeroed in on individual characters, season three has returned to a more ensemble-based approach. And while it's kept the love of high-concept gimmicks, it's also tried to find driving threads to anchor the season. In fact, on paper, this finale weaves together all sorts of ongoing through-lines: Marie's Gorn infection, the introduction of Dr. Korby, the Vezda threat, and the burgeoning Kirk/Spock friendship from “The Sehlat Who Ate Its Tail.” It even brings back my beloved Ensign Gamble. 

The trouble is, most of those arcs have been rooted in plot rather than character. And that's left season three feeling kind of hollow. For all its ongoing story threads, this season hasn't made us feel for its characters the way the show once did. Instead, everyone's emotional arcs stop and start at random depending on what each weekly installment calls for.

Case in point: This finale is all about saying goodbye to Melanie Scrofano's Captain Marie Batel. Yet it basically needs to invent its own self-contained short story in order to make us feel her loss. Though Marie has spent this entire season living on Enterprise, the show devoted more time to exploring the logistics of her Gorn infection than fleshing out her relationship with Pike. So while I was incredibly moved by the flash-forward dream sequence that imagines a happy domestic future for the Pike-Batels, it also feels really bizarre that the show didn't spend more time building up to her exit. Why not give us a big Pike/Marie romance episode mid-season if this is what they had planned for the finale?  

It's frustrating because the flash-forward proves Strange New Worlds can have compelling character dynamics. I felt more for Marie and Pike in those 11 minutes than I have in the past three seasons combined. There's specificity to the gifts they exchange on their second anniversary, to the way they comfort each other over his doomed future, and to the life they create when that future doesn't come to pass. Though the ominous knocking and disorienting editing clue us in that this future isn't real, it still makes you wish that Pike and Marie could actually have this picture-perfect happily ever after. Yet outside of those stellar 11 minutes, so much of Marie's story comes down to plot mechanics instead of emotion. 

This is a shame since the episode starts off with a nice character-centric focus too. Pike decides to throw Marie a going away party before she takes her new job at the Starfleet Judicial Department. That brings our whole main cast together in some fabulous space outfits to enjoy dinner and haze Scotty with their classic “make the newbie dress up” prank. And the subsequent reveal that Gamble's body has been rebuilt by the Vezda trapped in the Enterprise's transporter pattern seems to promise a return to all the emotional fallout I was missing back in “Through The Lens Of Time”—especially once Korby arrives on the planet of Skygowan to discover Vezda Gamble has established himself as a god there. 

Yet so many of those through-lines just devolve into rote plot beats. M'Benga joins Una, La'An, Uhura, and Chapel on a well-dressed undercover mission to Skygowan, where he learns it's his destiny to reunite with Vezda Gamble. Except the episode drops that thread almost as soon as it's introduced. Though the Vezda makes a point of saying he still has access to Gamble's memories, he winds up being just an eye-gouging Big Bad who happens to be played by Chris Myers. The episode spends more time on the logistics of how the Vezda travel through space to get back to the temple on Vadia IX than it does on the emotional fallout of Gamble's return. 

Similarly, the big twist about Marie's destiny arrives in dramatically inert fashion. The idea that she has to sacrifice herself to become the Beholder and stop the Vezda should hit us like an emotional wallop. But instead, it's dispatched in an expositional scene where she explains that her hybrid human/Gorn/Illyrian/Chimera flower DNA makes her a sort of Voltron of Goodness capable of containing the Pure Evil of the Vezda. It all plays out like a standard ready-room mission briefing rather than a woman realizing her life is about to end. 

Ostensibly, the M'Benga/Gamble and the Marie/Pike through-lines are linked by the theme of destiny. But in practice, it feels like the writers came up with one idea for this episode and then switched to another without doing a full rewrite. As is, I remain very unclear what M'Benga was destined to do here—or why “Shuttle To Kenfori” spent all that time establishing his close friendship with Pike if that was never going to be relevant again. There are a lot of plot mechanics to get M'Benga to his big reunion with Gamble, but there is no emotional payoff other than the fact that he continues to feel sad that his favorite ensign died.  

The same goes for the Chapel/Korby and Spock/La'An romances, both of which have been stuck repeating the same beat over and over again this season without gaining any new layers or depth along the way. At least Spock and Chapel's dynamic from the first two seasons had a sense of anticipation and longing to it. Here the season's big romances have just felt one-note—especially since Original Series fans know both dynamics have their limits.  

Indeed, destiny is a tricky theme for a prequel series with a preordained ending. While I do think Pike knowing his fate has added some effective emotional weight to the series, the idea that Marie was always destined to become the Beholder winds up undercutting her sacrifice by making it too easy for her to accept—even if the flash-forward at least somewhat tries to counter that. I also think the show has become a little too cute with steering us toward Spock and Kirk's best friendship instead of simply letting their bond develop organically. This episode comes up with an excuse to have them mind meld for some synchronized flying/shooting, which feels like a cheap shortcut to emotional intimacy. (Plus, wouldn't it make more sense for Spock to mind meld with the Farragut's Vulcan captain rather than a human “willing to do things others are not”?) 

The final scene where they agree to meet for regular chess games is a much better example of a friendship building naturally rather than getting jump-started with unlikely bridge missions and goofy mind melds. We've already got three seasons and six movies of Spock and Kirk as besties. There's no need to rush them into a dynamic we already know instead of lingering in unexplored territory. Strange New Worlds is at its best when its characters feel like actual people, not chess pieces to be moved around a board. Unfortunately, that's too seldom been the case this season.

In the end, the most interesting thing about “New Life And New Civilizations” is how much it feels like the closing of a chapter for one era of Strange New Worlds storytelling. Korby's map of uncharted space kicks off a new five-year mission that will (presumably) lead right into Kirk taking the captain's chair. But the loss of Marie also makes Pike a slightly sadder, more somber version of himself. 

To the show's credit, that is an example of subtle, compelling character work in action, the kind that shifts the show's dynamics on an emotional rather than plot level. Pike still has time as captain of the Enterprise. But that time is going to be different now that he's experienced such a seismic loss. That's an interesting idea to drive the final two seasons of the show. It's just a shame this season didn't find its own emotional hook to get us there.

	It's been nearly two months since the death of hard rock icon Ozzy Osbourne. And while the Prince of Darkness shuffled off this mortal coil on July 22 at age 76 after completing a number of projects that will keep him in our hearts for a while, the first posthumous reminder of his lovably sweet/salty nature has come from a most unexpectedly wholesome place.


	In the final challenge on the Lego Masters Jr. episode that aired earlier this week, the series' host, Kelly Osbourne, needed some help warning the budding brickmasters that they had just one hour left in their Ninjago build. While the sweat-inducing heads-up is typically delivered by host Will Arnett on the grown-up version of the show, Kelly brought in a real ringer to do the honors on Monday night's (Sept. 8) episode.

	











	“Hi Kelly,” Ozzy says to his daughter, beaming into the show remotely while seated in a brown leather chair, dressed in black, of course, with a number of gold necklaces on his chest and a sweet, bright smile on his face in a clip posted by Reality Club Fox. One of the young builders was confused, asking, “what? what is that?,” as his knowing mom explained, “it's her dad.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Hi dad, we need someone to scare a few of the kids,” Kelly told Ozzy. “Would you mind?”


	Always up for a good scare, Ozzy mischievously grinned, “I'd love to!,” busting out a maniacal laugh as he rubbed his hands together. As the buzzing alert bathed the brick floor in a blood red light, Ozzy intoned, “You've got one hour left to finish those builds!,” wagging his finger ominously as he added, “Or else!” and a demonic laugh.


	The kids were appropriately freaked out as Kelly said, “Thank you, daddy. That was perfect. We love you.”


	Celebrity partner Andy Richter laughed, “Oh Ozzy,” while one of the kid builders asked, “Who is that?” Another contestant helpfully explained, “It's Ozzy Osbourne. My dad loves him.”


	“Good luck kids!” Ozzy signed off.


	Osbourne died on July 22 at age 76, just a few weeks after taking the stage for the last time at the all-star Back to the Beginning show in his native Birmingham, U.K., which featured sets from Metallica, Slayer, Pantera, Mastodon, Lamb of God, Anthrax, Alice in Chains and many more.


	The sweet Lego pop-in is the first in what will be a string of posthumous projects from the late metal icon, including the 100-minute Back to the Beginning: Ozzy's Final Bow documentary about the last concert due in theaters in early 2026. There will also be a feature-length doc covering Ozzy's six-year struggle to recuperate from a devastating 2019 fall, Ozzy Osbourne: No Escape From Now, slated to debut on Paramount+ later this year. First up, though, is the rocker's second memoir, Last Rites, which will drop on Oct. 7 through Grand Central Publishing/Hachette Book Group.

Prepare for an awards season full of boxing metaphors: knockout performances, competitors getting into the ring, and none of it being over until that final bell. Are you ready to ruuumbbllleeee, film fans? One film assured to shoulder the bulk of those buzzwords: David Michôd‘s “Christy,” the true-life tale of trailblazing boxer Christy Martin, as played by Sydney Sweeney.

Sweeney has been teasing the film for months, telling IndieWire earlier this year, “Christy will forever be one of the most inspiring in my life. She has faced such tremendous challenges inside and outside the ring, and her story inspired me beyond anything, and I cannot wait for other people to be inspired by her. She's just one of the most strong women I've ever met.”

She's not kidding. Sweeney, who threw herself so fully into the demanding role that her co-star Katy O'Brien recently shared that she didn't even care if she broke her nose while filming, thrilled audiences when the film premiered at TIFF last week. As this critic noted, “Sweeney disappears into the role, not just changing her hair color, eye color, accent, and way of moving, but her general air, her overall mien, the space she takes up in a room.” It's a truly transformative role for her, and the actress “is so credible in the role that the film seems made for big ovations at its conclusion.”

 










One thing that might surprise people? How grim Michôd's film (which he also wrote with his partner Mirrah Foulkes) gets. Martin's life was fraught, and “Christy” doesn't shy away from that at all. The result is a biopic far less interested in celebrating athletic wins and more compelled by the triumph of the human spirit over horrific circumstances. (Plus: solid performances from a raft of co-stars, including Ben Foster, Merritt Wever, and Ethan Embry.)

Just take a look at the film's official synopsis, which hints at all the trouble to come: “Christy Martin (Sydney Sweeney) never imagined life beyond her small-town roots in West Virginia — until she discovered a knack for punching people. Fueled by grit, raw determination, and an unshakable desire to win, she charges into the world of boxing under the guidance of her trainer and manager-turned-husband, Jim (Ben Foster). But while Christy flaunts a fiery persona in the ring, her toughest battles unfold outside it — confronting family, identity, and a relationship that just might become life-or-death. Based on remarkable true events, Christy Martin's story is one of resilience, courage, and the fight to reclaim one's life.”

Black Bear will release “Christy” in theaters on Friday, November 7. Check out the film's first trailer below.

The most romantic relationship in Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein isn't between Victor Frankenstein (Oscar Isaac) and his beloved Elizabeth (Mia Goth), reimagined here from a childhood friend to his brother's fiancée. Nor is it between Elizabeth and the Creature (Jacob Elordi), even though she sees his beautiful soul. No, the most tender bond in the film is between del Toro and the monster.

Del Toro's long-simmering adaptation—he's been talking about it in various capacities for at least 20 years—foregrounds the religious allegory in Mary Shelley's novel, as well as the Creature's existential torment. Some of the Doctor's creations can be quite melancholy, but Elordi's is full of fury: Endowed with supernatural strength and healing abilities more suggestive of a superhero than a walking corpse, he roars like a dragon as he rages across the permafrost searching for his creator. Despite this, he's the clear hero of the piece, a Christ figure—the table upon which he is resurrected is in the shape of a cross—who comes back from the dead to kill his God.

Like Shelley's novel, del Toro's Frankenstein opens in the Arctic, where a crew of sailors led by Captain Anderson (Lars Mikkelsen) bear witness to a violent confrontation once the Creature catches up to Frankenstein. Both sides of this dysfunctional father-son duo then tell their stories inside the warm confines of the Captain's quarters, where the 6'5″ Elordi's head skims the rough-hewn wooden ceiling. The film is thus split into two chapters, one focusing on Baron Frankenstein and the other on his Creature. 

Victor's tale is full of Oedipal angst, this time directed at his biological father Leopold (Charles Dance), a strict and demanding surgeon who young Victor (Christin Convery) blames for the death of his mother. This is one of the less subtle choices del Toro makes, but it's nothing compared to a moment later on, when Victor's younger brother William (Felix Kammerer) shouts, “You're the real monster!” at his moody elder sibling.

Yet, high-minded dialogue about gods and monsters drives Frankenstein, much of it delivered by Isaac as the arrogant young doctor who truly believes that he can improve on Nature's flawed design. “God is inept, and we must correct his mistakes!” he cries, shortly before being expelled from the Edinburgh medical school where his story really begins. Del Toro completely reimagines the portion of Shelley's novel where Dr. Frankenstein actually conquers death, adding a new character, the deep-pocketed industrialist Harlander (Christoph Waltz), who comes to Frankenstein with an offer of unlimited funding if he will allow Harlander to document his process. 

Harlander also has access to lots of dead bodies, which begin to pile up in the catacomb-like basement of the imposing stone tower where Dr. Frankenstein does his work. There's some mumbling about chi and the lymphatic system, but the real purpose of the lab scenes is for del Toro to recreate the morbid aesthetic of a 19th-century anatomical drawing. This is fair enough, as the science is all made up anyway. And there is a glistening, bloodless beauty to the gray corpses, posed like sculptures made of rotting flesh, their skin peeled back to expose their brains and spinal columns and fastened with wires in intricate patterns. 

These echo the lacing that crawls up the spine of Elizabeth's gowns, one of many sumptuous details in the costuming and production design. Visually, Frankenstein plays like del Toro's greatest hits: The flocked velvet and crumbling stone of Crimson Peak are reflected in the costuming—the capes and veils in a pair of funeral scenes are especially striking—as well as in Frankenstein's hilltop lair. Inside, giant tanks made of orange and green glass evoke the government facility in The Shape Of Water, but with a steampunk flair.

Cinematographer Dan Laustsen (Nightmare Alley) also produces some gorgeous images, ranging from an impressive tracking shot through the muddy, crowded streets of Victorian-era Edinburgh to a simple, sublime image of Elordi's Creature against a pale Arctic sunrise. Nobody spends money on a movie like Guillermo del Toro; Frankenstein reportedly cost $120 million to make, and it looks like it. Aesthetically, the film is just about perfect, a Gothic memento mori—Elizabeth is introduced contemplating a human skull—as lush and romantic as we've come to expect from the filmmaker.

Where the whole experience becomes a bit ponderous is in the unwavering solemnity of its tone. Maybe two or three minutes of Frankenstein are actually light or funny; a low ratio for a 90-minute film, let alone a 149-minute one. The rest is all deathly serious, and Frankenstein bends under its own weight as the runtime wears on, particularly in the sections where del Toro blatantly telegraphs the themes. The cast dutifully trudges along, but all seem exhausted by the film's end. 

Still, it's the ideal subject matter for this particular filmmaker. Del Toro's love for the grotesque and the abject is sincere and passionate, and there are scenes in Frankenstein that play like thesis statements for the director's entire career. One takes place in a modest cabin, where the Creature finds refuge with a blind man who does not fear him for his looks. After finding out the truth of his origins, the Creature despairs: “I am the child of a charnel house!”

To that, the old man replies, “You are my friend.”

The legendary filmmaker turned up at the press preview of Jaws: The Exhibition, the Academy Museum's largest installation to date for any single film. It opens to the public Sunday, Sept. 14.


							By 

	Chris Gardner



Steven Spielberg didn't prepare a speech for the Academy Museum's Jaws exhibition preview Wednesday morning, but when he stepped up to the podium and revealed why, hundreds of press and staff seated inside the David Geffen Theater immediately got the joke.


	“Because I didn't come prepared in 1974 to make Jaws, or not prepare very well enough, I decided to risk it again and not come prepared with any remarks today to talk to you,” the legendary 78-year-old director admitted. “I'm empty-handed except for the collection of memories stimulated just in the last hour and a half of walking through the exhibition that they have so ingeniously assembled from the archives of collectors all over the world.”

	It was quite the collection, too, both Spielberg's memories and the array of rare objects, photos, memorabilia, set pieces, merchandise and immersive environments presented inside an expansive exhibition space, the largest dedicated to a single film in the Academy Museum's history. It's just steps away from “Bruce,” the sole surviving full-scale shark model from Jaws that is often lovingly referred to as the museum's unofficial mascot. 


	Also on view in the Marilyn and Jeffrey Katzenberg Gallery: Spielberg's annotated script, storyboards and original concept illustrations of the shark by production designer Joe Alves, composer John Williams' sheet music, sketches of a shark rising from the depths by Roger Kastel, the original Jaws clapper board from Spielberg's collection, the Panavision underwater camera used to shoot key scenes, a shark cage, a costume worn by Roy Scheider, original shark design schematics by design engineer Frank Wurmser, a prop dorsal fin, rare behind-the-scenes images and merchandise, and visual displays. Visitors can test their “dun dun” talents on a miniature keyboard, re-create a dolly zoom with their iPhone or maneuver a mechanical shark.

	











	The piece that got the first shout-out from Spielberg on stage was the buoy that floats in the water as Chrissie Watkins is claimed as Jaws' first victim. “How did anybody know to take the buoy, take it home and sit on it for 50 years and then loan it to the Academy? How did they know? I didn't know,” Spielberg mused.


	Nobody could have predicted what a cultural phenomenon Jaws became, how it would influence moviemaking or how it would endure 50 years after its release. During her comments, Academy Museum director Amy Homma noted how a recent rerelease of the Universal Pictures title finished at No. 2 at the box office. “He has continually toppled his own achievements,” praised Homma, who shared the stage with senior exhibitions curator Jenny He. “That is a complete testament to his work, which stands the test of time. He has explored new themes and ideas, sometimes treating us to dazzling thrill rides, and other times guiding us through introspective journeys into our own histories, our dreams, and the depths of our own souls. American cinema and world cinema would not be the same over the past half century without Steven Spielberg.”


	Homma had the honors of also breaking a bit of news at the event when she revealed that the Academy Museum will mount a first-ever Spielberg career retrospective for 2028. No other details were offered. Having him in the building on such an occasion helped create a splash at the unveiling but event organizers made waves by also reeling in the Hollywood Scoring Orchestra under the direction of Richard Kaufman to play selections from Williams' score as images from the film flashed on the Geffen Theater big-screen. Bonus: The orchestra featured two musicians who played on the original recording session, including Dennis Karmazyn on cello and Kaufman who played violin.

	











	As for those memories that he shared, Spielberg went back to the beginning and recalled how he “thought my career was over” halfway through production. “Everybody was saying to me, ‘You are never going to get hired again. This film is way over budget, way over schedule and you are a real liability as a director. You are not going to get hired again,'” said Spielberg, who was only 26 at the time of filming. “I really thought that I better give this my all because I'm not working in the industry again after they see the movie. Fortunately, fortune smiled on us.”


	But it took a while for that to happen. As has been exhaustively reported, the production faced one debacle after another. “I just really was not ready to endure the amount of obstacles that were thrown in our path,” Spielberg said Wednesday. “Starting with Mother Nature, my hubris was that I thought we could take a Hollywood crew, go out 12 miles into the Atlantic Ocean and shoot an entire movie with a mechanical shark. I thought that was going to go swimmingly.”


	Spoiler alert: It didn't go swimmingly. 


	“I was offered, actually, several times a chance to gracefully bow out of the film, not to be replaced by another director, but for the film to be shut down,” Spielberg continued, adding that the entire production went about 100 days over schedule. “We shot 158 days, but nobody wanted to quit. Nobody wanted to stop. Every week, I'd have five or six people come over to me to say, ‘I have children. I have dependents. I haven't seen them. I haven't seen my family. I've been here for five months. Give me an incentive to keep working on your movie. Give me a date or a guarantee of when you're going to wrap.' I didn't know when we were going to wrap until two weeks before we wrapped on Martha's Vineyard. That's how little control we had over the shark, the weather, the currents, the regattas.”

	











	Spielberg credited “the company of each other” for getting them through the troubled production. “The camaraderie that happens when you're just trying to survive something, it brought all of us closer together. I've never been closer to a crew or a cast until many years later. But this was the ultimate example that when you work as a team, you can actually get the ball across the finish line. And we did, and I'm very proud of the movie. The film certainly cost me a pound of flesh, but gave me a ton of career. And the success of the movie gave me a chance to make any movie I wanted to make after that.”


	And the rest, as they say, is history.

Bowen Yang praised his ‘Saturday Night Live‘ co-star and collaborator Heidi Gardner after her exit from the late-night sketch show. Speaking on his Las Culturistas podcast, Yang said of Gardner, “You are one of the greats. You will go down in history.”


	Gardner is one of several cast members not returning for Season 51. The show is losing Gardner, Devon Walker, Michael Longfellow, Emil Wakim, and John Higgins while gaining five new cast members. 


	“I am thrilled to go back,” Yang acknowledged. “I will miss the people who are not coming back very, very much.” He added, “Shout out Devon, Emil, Michael Longfellow. They were fantastic comedians going in. They are fantastic comedians coming out. Those are some A+ gems.”


	He singled out Gardner as a cast member who was trusted to write sketches solo. “It's always a very, very vulnerable thing as a cast member to put only your name on it,” Yang said. “But anytime you saw just ‘Gardner,' you knew you were in good hands. She would take it upon herself to write pieces for other cast.”

	He recalled a “Weekend Update” segment Gardner penned for former cast member Punkie Johnson. “It was one of the most beautiful, kindest gestures I've ever seen at that show, and her heart was so big, and clearly so fucking funny,” Yang said. “A true anchor on that show.”


	Yang also credited Gardner with helping to get the cast through the Covid pandemic. “[She was] one of the first people who was just like, ‘Okay, just to get through this, let's just each wake up, no rush, there's no time limit — let's just each text each other every day, something that made us smile today,'” Yang recalled. “And that was this foothold that I had emotionally in terms of knowing we were just sharing music.” He called his former co-star “a truly beautiful person.”

	Earlier this week, after a string of departures, Saturday Night Live confirmed its Season 51 cast, with Yang, Kenan Thompson, and Weekend Update co-hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che among those set to return. According to multiple reports, much of last year's main cast will be back at Studio 8H this fall, including Ego Nwodim, Chloe Fineman, Marcello Hernandez, Andrew Dismukes, Sarah Sherman, and James Austin Johnson (who, of course, handles the show's all-important Donald Trump impression).


	The biggest exit this year was Gardner, who enjoyed a very successful eight-year run on the show. During season 49, she participated in more sketches than any other cast member, and she was the longest-tenured female cast member during Season 50. Gardner has yet to address her departure from the show.

Stephen Colbert spoke out about the death of Charlie Kirk on the most recent episode of The Late Show, reminding viewers that “political violence does not solve any of our political differences.”


	“Good evening, everybody,” Colbert said as he opened the late-night show. “After our scripts for tonight's show were finished, we learned that Charlie Kirk, a prominent right-wing activist, was killed at a speaking engagement in Utah. Our condolences go out to his family and all of his loved ones. I am old enough to personally remember the political violence of the 1960s, and I hope it is obvious to everyone in America that political violence does not solve any of our political differences. Political violence only leads to more political violence. And I pray with all my heart that this is the aberrant action of a madman and not a sign of things to come.”


	While Jimmy Kimmel didn't address Kirk's death on Jimmy Kimmel Live, he did post his thoughts on Instagram. “Instead of the angry finger-pointing, can we just for one day agree that it is horrible and monstrous to shoot another human?” Kimmel wrote. “On behalf of my family, we send love to the Kirks and to all the children, parents, and innocents who fall victim to senseless gun violence.”

	Kirk was shot dead Wednesday while speaking to students at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. The right-wing political influencer and activist, who co-founded Turning Point USA to foster a culture of conservatism on school campuses around the nation, was 31. News of Kirk's death generated shock throughout the U.S. political ecosystem. Donald Trump ordered that flags at the White House be flown at half-staff until Sunday afternoon.

	“The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead,” Trump wrote Wednesday afternoon on Truth Social. “No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us. Melania and my Sympathies go out to his beautiful wife Erika, and family. Charlie, we love you!”


	“We don't yet know what motivated the person who shot and killed Charlie Kirk, but this kind of despicable violence has no place in our democracy,” wrote former President Barack Obama. “Michelle and I will be praying for Charlie's family tonight, especially his wife Erika and their two young children.”

The makeup of the "AGT" Semifinals has been revealed.

	Trust LE SSERAFIM to crank the heat. 


	The South Korean girl group strutted their stuff on the America's Got Talent stage Wednesday night (Sept. 10), for a two-song showcase.


	The pop outfit took a pause from the US leg of their EASY CRAZY HOT world tour for a breezy, three-minute medley of “HOT” (English version) and “ANTIFRAGILE.”


	Afterwards, bandmate Huh Yunjin took the mic to share some advice for the AGT hopefuls. “Whatever the outcome, it's all a part of you,” she remarked. “So what matters is the passion that brought you here. I hope that that stays with you forever. We're all rooting for you. You guys are so talented and it's been an honour to share the stage with you.”

	Earlier this year, the ensemble scored its second No. 1 on Billboard's Top Album Sales chart as HOT debuted atop the tally. That feat marked LE SSERAFIM's fifth top 10 in total for the group, which previously reached No. 1 with its last chart entry, 2024's Crazy.

	While LE SSERAFIM turned up the temperature, ten AGT performers were already sweating on the results of the final Quarterfinal.

Kirk was shot and killed Wednesday on the campus of Utah Valley University.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	Matthew Dowd, a MSNBC political analyst, has been fired following statements he made on the network in the wake of the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, an MSNBC source has confirmed. 


Kirk died Wednesday on the campus of Utah Valley University after being shot by an assassin's bullet. 




	When discussing the shooting on air, MSNBC correspondent Katy Tur asked a question about “the environment in which a shooting like this happens.”


	Dowd, in his response, stated, “He's been one of the most divisive, especially divisive younger figures in this, who is constantly sort of pushing this sort of hate speech or sort of aimed at certain groups. And I always go back to, hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions. And I think that is the environment we are in. You can't stop with these sort of awful thoughts you have and then saying these awful words and not expect awful actions to take place. And that's the unfortunate environment we are in.”

	Before news of Dowd's termination was confirmed, MSNBC president Rebecca Kutler released a statement refuting his comments. “During our breaking news coverage of the shooting of Charlie Kirk, Matthew Dowd made comments that were inappropriate, insensitive and unacceptable. We apologize for his statements, as has he. There is no place for violence in America, political or otherwise,” Kutler said.


	Dowd also later apologized, writing on his BlueSky account, “My thoughts & prayers are w/ the family and friends of Charlie Kirk. On an earlier appearance on MSNBC I was asked a question on the environment we are in. I apologize for my tone and words. Let me be clear, I in no way intended for my comments to blame Kirk for this horrendous attack. Let us all come together and condemn violence of any kind.”

	











The Hollywood Reporter reached out to MSNBC for comment, but did not hear back at the time of publication. 


	Hollywood and political figures took to social media Wednesday to share their reactions and tributes to the late MAGA activist. President Donald Trump announced his death on Truth Social, where he wrote, “The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead. No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us. Melania and my Sympathies go out to his beautiful wife Erika, and family. Charlie, we love you!”


	Late night host Jimmy Kimmel took to Instagram, where he wrote, “Instead of the angry finger-pointing, can we just for one day agree that it is horrible and monstrous to shoot another human? On behalf of my family, we send love to the Kirks and to all the children, parents and innocents who fall victim to senseless gun violence.”

King Gizz are inviting fans to download their catalogue on Bandcamp at whatever price they decide.

	After pulling their tunes from Spotify, King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard are flipping the script once again by inviting fans to download their catalog on Bandcamp at whatever price they choose.

	The prolific Australian psych-rock outfit have tagged all their downloadable albums as “name your price,” a generous promotion that has the hallmarks of Radiohead's groundbreaking In Rainbows experiment from 2007, when the British band invited fans to pay whatever they wanted to download the then-new album, their first outside of the EMI machine.

					No, Ed Sheeran Is Not Actually Moving to America: 'Here's Me Setting the Record Straight'		
	












	King Gizz, as they're known in their homeland, and with their loyal fans everywhere, has applied the pay-what-you-want offer to their considerable catalogue, and fans have got into the spirit of the exercise.




			Trending on Billboard		







	At the time of writing the entire top 25 digital albums on Bandcamp are from King Gizz.


	The rockers are in a giving mood, after recently pulling their music from Spotify, a protest to CEO and co-founder Daniel Ek's personal investment in military AI.




	“Hello friends… A PSA to those unaware,” read a message on the band's later Instagram Story, posted in late July. “Spotify CEO Daniel Ek invests millions in AI military drone technology… We just removed our music from the platform… Can we put pressure on these Dr. Evil tech bros to do better?… Join us on another platform.”


	They've done just that.


	King Gizz are no ordinary recording artists. At the time of writing, their discography numbers 27 studio albums, three EPs, and six live albums, a figure that could change any day now.


	In 2017, the Melbourne act promised, and delivered, five studio albums in a calendar year. Five years later, they did it again, by releasing five albums in the calendar year 2022.


	If Radiohead's honest box concept is anything to go by, consumers won't dig deep for King Gizz downloads. According to a 2007 study by Internet research group ComScore, which examined how consumers reacted to that unusual digital release strategy, 38% paid an average of $6. The rest paid nothing. The subsequent physical release was a conventional one, and a global hit.


	Since it was founded in 2008, Bandcamp boasts more than $1.57 billion paid to artists using the platform. Bandcamp downloads are available in MP3, FLAC and more, and supporters get unlimited streaming via the free Bandcamp app.

LE SSERAFIM made history tonight on one of the biggest stages in America. The group became the first K-pop girl group to perform on “America's Got Talent” when they hit the stage tonight, and fans couldn't be more excited.

Known for their powerful performances and global impact, the five members brought their signature energy to the “AGT” stage, marking a milestone moment for both the group and K-pop fans worldwide.

LE SSERAFIM consists of five members: Sakura, Kim Chaewon, Huh Yunjin, Kazuha, and Hong Eunchae. They took the “AGT” stage to perform live in front of the audience during the live results show for week 4 of the Quarterfinals.

For their performance, the girl group performed their hit songs “HOT” and “ANTIFRAGILE,” which NBC shared on their YouTube page. It definitely was an electric performance, as the group is full of energy, and it had the crowd on their feet the entire time.

Shortly after LE SSERAFIM performed on the “America's Got Talent” 2025 stage, the show shared their performance on social media. Fans were quick to share their love for the all-girl group.

One user wrote, “INCREDIBLE performance Le Sserafim deserve this so much ❤️,” while another person added, “Slayed my girls, amazing performance,” and a third fan commented, “Oh wow! I'm in awe of your performance; you truly deserve the spotlight.”

It was love all around for this K-Pop group, as the Instagram post shared by the “AGT” page had over 25K hearts and 300 comments quickly after they posted it.

One fan wrote, “Le sserafim are just so good. Glad you had them on the show. So proud of Le Sserafim. 💕💕💗💗🥰🎉” Another person commented, “The Performance was incredible 😭💙 Biggest Girl Group for a Reason,” while this fan commented, “I love to see the improvement honestly. They're such a good girl group.”

A post shared by “scary spice Mel B” (@officialmelb)

While some “America's Got Talent” viewers might not know who LE SSERAFIM was before tonight, the girl group has been impressing American audiences for a while now.

They performed at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards, as well as taking the stage for a performance on “TODAY.”

The group also made some waves when they lit up New York's iconic Empire State Building in their official team color. The girls have been consistent in their efforts, as they have built a big fan base in the United States. This has helped them gain even broader mainstream recognition.

If you're not already keen on “This Is Spinal Tap,” Rob Reiner's 1984 mockumentary about a fake English rock band that effectively started the genre, there might not be much for you in “Spinal Tap II: The End Continues.” Reiner returns in front of the camera as documentary filmmaker Marty Di Bergi as well as behind it to direct this four-decades-in-waiting sequel, which reunites ex-bandmates David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), and Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer). 

The last film ended on a Druid-themed glam rock show that turned the band into a laughing stock; in “The End Continues,” well, the end continues because it turns out contractually there was a hidden clause in Spinal Tap's contract that obligates them to put on one last show. The issue with “The End Continues” is not so much the movie's quality as the band's: Are they supposed to be bad, good, or good-bad?

Candidly, I have not seen the original movie in more than 20 years, but “The End Continues” doesn't exactly send you rushing back to your VHS or DVD copy of the original. Rather, you might be content to leave it on the shelf as it was.

 










As with the first film, “Spinal Tap II” is written by McKean, Guest, and Shearer, whose bewigged characters 40 years after their last tour — in which a stunt involving a miniaturized Stonehenge trilithon went disastrously awry, among other blunders — are now far-flung and out of the music business. Vocal frontman David (McKean) is now living in Morro Bay, writing music for murder podcasts and the score for a low-budget horror movie called “Night of the Assisted Living Dead.” Lead guitarist Nigel (Guest) is living in Berwick-Upon-Tweed as a cheesemonger and says, “I don't miss the friction,” with regard to his globally touring past. Bass player Derek (Shearer), meanwhile, lives in London, where he's running a glue museum. He's also composed a symphony called “Hell Toupé.” Say that out loud, and it stirs up a minor chuckle.

A heart-on-its-sleeve, inoffensive, and amusing sequel about the legacies we run away from only to come crashing back into them in middle or later age, “Spinal Tap II: The End Continues” forcibly returns characters from the first movie played by Paul Shaffer and Fran Drescher, little more than fan-service padding. The film also finds the Spinal Tap metalheads contemplating their mortality once again, as famously they have long had terrible luck holding down a drummer (i.e., keeping them alive amid a string of mysterious deaths). Here, they hold a series of auditions on the road to their reunion tour set for New Orleans, talking to everyone from Questlove to a Blue Man Group drummer, and even Lars Ulrich of Metallica fame, before landing on lesbian drummer Didi Crockett (Valerie Franco, an actual IRL drummer).

 










Other music world celebrities float in and out of the movie, from Paul McCartney, who incites panic in the rehearsal room, to Elton John, who actually ends up onstage with Spinal Tap and in a slapstick pratfall (and blatant callback to the first movie) that intentionally or not reminds of the singer/songwriter's own mortal fallibility. Country singers Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood also show up apropos of nada, perhaps just to show the band's proximity to other music legends and where they're slotted in a fictional music universe.

This is a movie that would probably be really funny if you were high. The laughs are mostly dry and deadpan, depending on your closeness to and fondness for the material — in other words, very much in line with the mockumentary world of producer Christopher Guest, from “Best in Show” to “A Mighty Wind.” Frequent guest collaborator John Michael Higgins steals his one scene in “The End Continues” as a flamboyant personal trainer hired to whip the band into shape. 

Fans should be grateful to have “Spinal Tap II: The End Continues” as a totally uncynical reanimated ghost of I.P. past. After all, the original 1984 film nearly wasn't made at all, with Reiner and the filmmakers knocking on the door of nearly every studio and mostly rejected. With its legacy nowadays, “The End Continues” must have been an easier sell. The legacy of the band itself, though? We're not so sure.

 










Bleecker Street will release “Spinal Tap II: The End Continues” in theaters Friday, September 12.

A woman named Jauhara Jeffries claimed the R&B singer groped her at E11even Miami in the first hours of 2018.

Trey Songz has reached a confidential settlement to end a lawsuit claiming he sexually assaulted a woman at a Miami nightclub on New Year's Eve in 2018.


	The R&B singer (Tremaine Neverson) was facing assault and battery claims from Jauhara Jeffries, who alleges Songz non-consensually penetrated her with his fingers while they were dancing at E11even Miami in the early hours of Jan. 1, 2018. Songz denied ever assaulting Jeffries.


	The pair had been gearing up to go to trial next month alongside E11even Miami, which was accused in Jeffries' lawsuit of negligently serving alcohol to Songz despite his public history of substance abuse. But new docket entries in Florida court say Jeffries, Songz and the club have all reached a settlement to end the litigation.


	“This court has been advised that the matter has been settled as to all parties and therefore, it is hereby ordered and adjudged that this case is dismissed,” wrote Judge Antonio Arzola on Tuesday (Sept. 9). “The court reserves jurisdiction to enforce the settlement and to enter orders necessary to this enforcement.”


	The terms of the settlement have not been made public, as is typical for out-of-court resolutions. Jeffries' lawyer, Ariel Mitchell, tells Billboard on Wednesday (Sept. 10), “I can only comment that the matter has been resolved.”


	Reps for Songz and E11even Miami did not immediately return requests for comment.


	Songz has faced numerous allegations of sexual misconduct over the years. The singer previously settled claims that he assaulted a woman at a Los Angeles house party in 2016, and he's set to go to trial next year over a separate Las Vegas incident from 2021.


	Jeffries first filed her lawsuit in 2020, and it had been scheduled to go to trial in Miami this October before a settlement was reached. The case had been muddled by allegations from Songz's legal team that Mitchell, Jeffries' attorney, attempted to bribe a witness into backing her client's version of the events at E11even Miami.


	Mitchell has strongly denied these claims, and Judge Arzola ultimately declined to issue penalties earlier this year after finding that there wasn't conclusive evidence of bribery in what amounted to a “classic ‘she-said versus she-said' scenario.”


	However, Mitchell is facing disciplinary action from the Florida Bar for falsely telling media outlets, including Billboard, back in 2022, that she'd already been cleared of wrongdoing related to the bribery allegations. In reality, says the Florida Bar, Mitchell was still under investigation at the time of these press comments.

The response comes as nearly 4,000 figures from the international film and TV landscape — including high-profile Oscar, Emmy and Palm d'Or winners — have pledged not to work with Israeli counterparts they deem “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.”


							By 

	Gary Baum


Senior Writer


	On Sept. 8, a group of industry workers vowed not to work with Israeli counterparts they contend are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.” Two days later, the list of co-signatories has ballooned to nearly 4,000 individuals, including Joaquin Phoenix, Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo, Lily Gladstone, Tilda Swinton, Ava DuVernay, Yorgos Lanthimos, as well as other Oscar, Emmy and Palm d'Or winners.


	Israel's industry leaders believe the boycott effort is misguided and self-defeating — that its effect only undermines and isolates a group of people who are, within the country, among the most sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and perhaps best positioned to give voice to it. “For decades, Israeli creators, artists, and storytellers — myself included — have devoted our work to reflecting the complexity of our reality,” Nadav Ben Simon, chairman of the Israeli screenwriters' guild, told The Guardian. “In times like these, we as creators must be devoted to amplifying the light, not deepening the darkness.”

					Amid the Tragedy of War, Palestinian Filmmakers Are Finding a Way to Break Through		
			









	The right-wing Israeli government and its allies in and out of the country have consistently rejected assertions by activists, scholars, human rights organizations and international legal bodies that the country is committing genocide and apartheid in the Palestinian territories. (The signatories' letter justifying its action makes no mention of the Gaza-controlling militant organization Hamas, which prompted Israel's vengeance after it killed nearly 1,200 of its citizens in October 2023, nor the hostages which Hamas has held since.)

	











	Merav Etrog Bar, of the Directors Guild of Israel, and Lior Elefant, of Israel's Documentary Forum, noted in a joint statement: “Many of the films and series, both documentary and narrative, produced in Israel have dealt with [the Palestinian crisis] with sensitivity, fairness, and critical thinking; there are thousands of examples of this. While Israeli filmmakers are not their government, we bear responsibility for its actions and find ourselves caught between a rock and a hard place: on one side, attempts at silencing from within, and on the other, international boycott from abroad.”


	Tzvi Gottlieb, CEO of the Israeli Film & TV Producers Association, tells The Hollywood Reporter the boycott is “counterproductive,” explaining “there is no group in Israel that's been working as hard to promote anti-violence and has been as critical of this government. This industry — already small, already vulnerable — shows the damage of occupation. We need to be helped, not hurt.”


	None of the high-profile boycott signatories appear to have taken similar public positions against the Russian industry (considering the war against Ukraine) or the Chinese industry (given alleged human rights abuses against China's Uyghur Muslim population). “Israelis are the easy target,” Gottlieb says.


	The boycott is focused on Israeli institutions including festivals, cinemas, broadcasters and production companies which may receive government support. Gottlieb notes that in Israel, as in many countries, art critical of the government is often supported by government funding: “Here, we have Kan buying and ordering productions; in Britain, it's the BBC. The government has yet to tell us what you can't say.”

	











	Liat Benasuly, an Israeli Film & TV Producers Association board member and a producer of Netflix's Fauda, about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, finds the boycott tragic and frustrating. “I'm extremely left, and I can't emphasize how much I'm against this horrible government. My friends and all the artists here are like me. We are trying to change our reality — and [the signatories] are trying to silence our voices, our art, as we try to speak about this complex situation. This just helps this government, who'd prefer we were silent, too. It's perfect for them.”

The NFL Guess Who? board game is an officially-licensed collaboration between the league and toymaker Hasbro.

	Just in time for the start of the 2025 NFL season, Hasbro has dropped a new football-themed edition of its popular Guess Who? board game.


	Just like the beloved original, players work to identify the characters — or in this case, the football players — on their opponent's board and race to be the first one to close all their tabs once they guess correctly.


	The NFL-edition of “Guess Who?” features players from all 32 teams in the league, including superstars like Travis Kelce, Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson and Jalen Hurts.

	While the recently-engaged Kelce is perhaps the most famous face in the pack, there are 48 athletes in total to guess from — 24 from the AFC and 24 from the NFC, though they're randomly divided between the two boards. Each square has a photo of the football player in their team jersey, along with their position.




	Just like the original Guess Who? game, players can only ask “yes” or “no” questions to try to figure out the mystery NFL star's identity (hint: start by asking about their team conference or division, then jersey color or playing position).


	The NFL Guess Who? board game is an officially-licensed collaboration between the league and toymaker Hasbro. What we like: the two sides fold out for game-play but then snap together into a single case for easy storage. 




	Suitable for kids ages 6 and up (though really it's great for all ages), this Guess Who? edition is a great gift idea for sports fans and makes for a fun family game night activity too.


	More football-themed game options? Mattel has an officially-licensed UNO game that features the logos of all 32 NFL teams. Everything comes in a football-branded storage tin.

SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (KY3) - Southwest Missouri Congressman Eric Burlison introduced new legislation regarding the investigation of UFOs or UAPs (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) in the United States. 

According to the National UFO Reporting Center, in the state of Missouri, there have been 2,911 reports of strange things in the sky.

According to the 2025 budget, the United States will spend around $850 billion on national defense. And this week, the Oversight Subcommittee held a hearing called Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection. UAP Disclosure Act of 2025, if passed it would be an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act government records related to UAPs.

“For me, this is not a topic that was like a pet project of mine; being on the committee, it is a fascinating topic, I won't lie,” said Congressman Burlison. “I have been in politics for a little bit. This is the most interesting topic; it is never boring. I remain a skeptic; I don't believe there are little green men flying here from other solar systems or whatever. I tell people consistently I'm from the Show-Me-State, you are going to have to show me.”

The goal is to keep records from being destroyed, create a UAP Records Collection at the National Archives, create an independent review board, and require disclosure of UAP records within 25 years unless a clear national security concern is addressed by the president. 

For Rep. Burlison, the hearings and evidence presented is interesting when it comes to public interest, but it more about where the money is going when it comes to the investigations in the phenomena.

“What has been shown and proven is that we are spending a lot of money on this topic, and there is no oversight,” said Rep. Burlison. “And so, being on the oversight committee and specifically on the oversight committee that is investigating this topic and others is why I am kind of in the position that I am in. And I think if I am going to do my job right, I am going to do it like I do everything else, do it diligently and try to get to the bottom of things.”

The world of The Conjuring is having one hell of a moment. Just days after The Conjuring: Last Rites scared up the biggest horror opening in movie history, the franchise is expanding into television with a major creative hire at HBO Max.

According to Variety, Nancy Won has joined the long-awaited Conjuring series as writer, executive producer, and showrunner. She worked on projects such as Jessica Jones, Supernatural, and Little Fires Everywhere. 

With her genre experience and character-driven storytelling, she feels like a natural fit to carry the terrifying legacy of this franchise.

Plot details for the series are still locked away, but it has been confirmed that the show will continue the story of the movies. Peter Cameron and Cameron Squires have also been brought on as writers. The duo previously worked together on WandaVision and Agatha All Along. 

Cameron's other credits include Moon Knight and Werewolf By Night, while Squires has contributed to Gen V Season 2. With that lineup, it looks like the series will have the same mix of dark thrills and character-driven drama that made the films so successful.

This news arrives on the heels of a box office triumph. The Conjuring: Last Rites, which hit theaters on September 5, has already grossed $194 million worldwide. That number gives it the biggest opening for a horror movie ever, knocking 2017's IT out of the top spot, which held the record with $190 million. 

It's a shame because, unfortunatly, the movie wasn't that good and is easily the weakest in the franchise. The film stars Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprising their roles as Ed and Lorraine Warren, diving into the chilling real-life Smurl haunting.

There's still no release date for the Conjuring series, but with Won leading the charge and a powerhouse team of writers on board, the Warrens' haunted adventures are about to get creepier than ever on HBO Max.

The Conjuring series of films have brought in hundreds of millions of dollars, and the ninth installment, “The Conjuring: Last Rites,” opened in theaters this weekend.

But the Hollywood blockbuster was based on a haunting that took place here in Pennsylvania, and a Pennsylvania author has recently released a book on that very incident.

Maxim Furek, an author of several books on paranormal events, released “The Smurl Haunting: When Ed and Lorraine Came to Town” in August.

The book documents the event surrounding the Smurl family of West Pittston, Luzerne County, who claimed a demon had taken residence in their home.

“I live in Luzerne County, a tiny little mountain community called Mocanaqua, and West Pittston was right up the road for me,” Furek said. “And during the frenzy of the 1980s, I went up there numerous times just to check it out, to to talk to the neighbors, just to get a sense of what was going on.”

The haunting led to a visit from famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren in 1986. And that visit is the inspiration for the new movie.

“Ed and Lorraine Warren are known in the community, and they were sort of the ambassadors [for paranormal investigations],” Furek said. “They were the ones who introduced educated America to a demonology, and they were very successful.”

The era was full of pop culture fascination with the occult and the paranormal, Furek said, thanks to films like “Rosemary's Baby” and “The Exorcist.”

The Smurl family's story of demonic presence has been dubbed by some as “Pennsylvania's Amityville Horror,” since that famous haunted house was also investigated by the Warrens, and was the inspiration for several films, including “The Conjuring 2.”

While Furek didn't interview the Smurls directly in the 1980s, he did speak to the Warrens and has visited the home several times since.

“I stayed in touch with Ed and Lorraine over the years,” he said. “I would ask Ed specifically how he did battle with these demonic forces. And they always underscored the fact that they were Christians, and that even though the power of the devil is great, the power of God is greater.”

The power of faith was also a conversation Furek had with Dan Rivera, a protege of the Warrens and handler of the famed Annabelle doll (also featured in the Conjuring films). Furek and Rivera met in Gettysburg earlier this year. Rivera died suddenly soon after.

“I told him I was working on my Smurl haunting book, and he agreed to an interview on Monday, July the 14th,” Furek said. Rivera died on Sunday, July 13.

The timing was coincidental, though Furek noted in his field, there are those who say “there's no such thing as a coincidence.”

Jack and Janet Smurl claimed that over the course of several years, they and their family suffered from things like unexplained loud noises and bad odors in their home, and that members of their family were shaken or assaulted by malevolent presences. 

And as recently as 2016, their daughter Carin Smurl said in an interview with the Pittston-Progress that the family didn't profit from the notoriety, and that “we wouldn't wish our experiences on anyone.”

Furek's book documents their accounts, the Warren's findings, and the involvement of other investigators, including priests and other exorcists. 

While he hadn't seen it at the time of the interview, he does hope to see “The Conjuring: Last Rites” and compare Hollywood's version of the story to what he found in his research.

“I think that these motion pictures are going to be a little bit dramatic and overblown, emphasized to a larger extent,” Furek said. “But again, it's, it's entertainment.”

Furek is a fan of the “Conjuring” series generally, and thinks that the scary movie and his book can pair together nicely.

“If you want to be entertained, go to see ‘The Conjuring: Last Rites',” he said. “If you want to be educated as to the right of exorcism and demonology, and how does the Smurl house compare with other haunted houses? Then read my book.”

Furek said that while he's written books on several supposed Pennsylvania paranormal events, he's particularly proud of this one “because it really does encapsulate the topic in a comprehensive way.”

And as an investigator, he notes that when it comes to Pennsylvania, “there's something in the water” that seems to draw these stories in.

“Pennsylvania is just filled with these stories, you know?” he said, whether it be ghosts in Gettysburg, hex signs and braucherei of the Pennsylvania Dutch, the Bigfoot-UFO connection in the western portion of the state, or even Hollywood movies like “The Conjuring: Last Rites” or “Night of the Living Dead.”

As an October baby, my favorite holiday (besides my birthday) is obviously Halloween.

And I have a few traditions when it comes to the best month of the year: Watch a scary movie every day and go to at least one haunted house.

So when I heard Carowinds was mixing my favorite things into a new, immersive attraction for its 25th anniversary of SCarowinds, I readied my heart for true terror.

SCarowinds is bringing “The Conjuring” horror film universe to the Carolinas with “The Conjuring: Beyond Fear.”

It's a haunted escape room and maze where participants will put on their paranormal sleuth hats and face off against The Nun, The Crooked Man, The Ferryman and Annabelle, the possessed doll that just won't stay in its case.

The attraction is a first on many fronts for Carowinds, particularly the collaboration with a major movie studio — in this case Warner Bros. — to use licensed material. It's one of the perks of being part of Six Flags Entertainment, park spokesman Chris Foshee told CharlotteFive.

“This is our first SCarowinds maze to be based off a blockbuster horror franchise, and it is the first ultra-immersive attraction that puts our guests into the storyline — making them live the horror, not just watch it,” Foshee said. “It is the biggest and boldest attraction we've ever debuted at SCarowinds.”

Of course, I had to test this theory. I popped on my vans, put my hair up, donned a “Friday the 13th” shirt and headed to SCarowinds to experience the attraction first.

Brief explainer: “The Conjuring” universe is about Ed and Lorraine Warren, real life paranormal investigators. The movies follow their demonic adventures and include spin-offs of some of the scarier characters.

No, you don't need to watch the movies in order to feel the fear of the attraction. I've only seen “The Conjuring.”

“The Conjuring: Beyond Fear” is in the Aeronautica section of the park. And to get there, visitors will have to make their way through scare zones brimming with crawling monsters and roaring chainsaws.

At the attraction, groups of about six to eight people will be thrust into a room where an old film camera starts to roll.

The footage explains that we've found ourselves in the Warren's occult museum, and something strange is going on.

Strange indeed, because when the guide bursts into the room and explains they need our help figuring out what on earth is going on, I questioned why I was in the front of the line.

From there, the group members become paranormal investigators. The guides demanded we pick up possessed artifacts that somehow escaped the Warren's locked room.

One of the artifacts was Annabelle, and for a doll, she's hefty and shifty. She will run away if you aren't paying attention. No, this isn't the real doll, which may be causing chaos on its U.S. tour.

Each room elicited an expletive, at least from my potty-mouth. The Nun pops out of a wall, a demon appears on a bed, crosses start to spin, a possessed figure scampers across the ceiling and a man with an axe cornered me in a random closet.

At one point, I was huddled with a cast member in a dark room and made to crawl to escape said man with the axe.

And at the end, hold on because a demonic earthquake rumbles the archive room as we fight to put Annabelle back into her case.

As I said, she was shifty.

I'm giving “The Conjuring: Beyond Fear” two thumbs up. I went through the experience twice and was equally scared both times. Each experience was different, as cast members choose who holds what artifacts and what you have to do with each piece of memorabilia.

I was stuck in a room alone my first go-around, but crawled through another room the second time.

My advice: Really engage with the guides and your group. Feed off each other energies.

The guides will help visitors get through each room and remind you to keep track of the artifacts. I left Annabelle behind at one point on my crawl, but she was promptly, and maybe unwillingly, returned to me.

The scare actors will lightly touch you and chase after you. But they'll also guide you out of the space if you need help.

It's an interactive and immersive experience, so the more you interact, the scarier your experience will be.

SCarowinds runs from Sept. 12 through Nov. 2.

There will be five haunted mazes and several scare zones and live shows. The major difference this year is guests will have to purchase a “Haunted Attraction Pass” to visit the haunted mazes. The $10 purchase is on top of the daily admission purchase.

Visitors will also have to purchase a separate ticket for “The Conjuring: Beyond Fear.” Prices vary from $15 to $25. It's a one-time use ticket.

Visitors can purchase a “Haunted Attraction Express Pass” for $49, which includes priority access to the mazes and one-time access to “The Conjuring” attraction.

All day pass and maze access: $49 to $55

All day pass and express maze access: $90

Some of the other mazes include Silver Scream Studios, which features throwbacks to past SCarowinds attractions and a maze with even more dolls.

A stunning video has claimed to capture an unidentified flying object (UFO) miraculously coming out unscathed after being hit with a hellfire missile from a U.S. military drone, RadarOnline.com can reveal.

Republican Representative Eric Burlison played the never-before-seen video at a congressional hearing.

The black and white video revealed the UFO cruising at an unusually high speed along the Yemen coast despite being hit by the 100-pound hellfire missile.

Jeffery Nuccetell, who served as a military police officer for 16 years, reportedly claimed the footage was "exceptional evidence" of UFOs.

Burlison played the video as whistleblowers testified to witnessing UFOs with their own eyes despite the U.S. government denying their existence for decades.

Eyewitness testimony overlapped when describing the mysterious flying objects they saw in the sky. Some accounts claimed the glowing, illuminated objects were spherical, while others recalled them being triangular.

At least two witnesses who testified under oath alleged they were pressured by government officials to stay silent about their astonishing experiences.

This isn't the first time Congress has heard testimony from whistleblowers and eyewitnesses about UFOs. For several years, Congress has held hearings on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena or UAPs, the government term for UFOs, in an attempt to gain transparency on top-secret government programs following years of speculation and scrutiny.

The Department of Defense created the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 to investigate claims of UFO sightings and establish a standardized data collection process.

An AARO report released in March 2024 concluded there was no evidence to support accusations claiming the government was hiding recovered alien spacecraft or technology, which further fueled cover-up conspiracy theories.

Following the report, Rep. Robert Garcia pushed for more transparency, saying: "We know that there are objects or phenomena observed in our airspace and also possibly in our oceans.

"The American people have legitimate questions, and I believe it's critical that Congress should help address them."

As RadarOnline.com reported, then-Senator Marco Rubio stunned the country when he casually admitted UFOs "routinely" fly over U.S. airspace after an unknown object was shot down over the South Carolina coast in 2023.

Recently released classified documents revealed a swarm of UFOs documented at an Ohio military base with ties to Roswell.

The documents were declassified, as well as a video of two separate assaults by unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Greene County in December.

Documents further revealed the Air Force felt that the waves of unidentified objects were so serious, they halted flight operations, alerted local law enforcement agencies, and utilized thermal imaging cameras to pinpoint the location and identity of the mysterious UFOs.

One officer at the Ohio base reportedly said: "The objects appeared to be lights moving as a group, but too high up to get an accurate assessment of what they looked like."

Another claimed the witnessed the UFO descend toward the base and got within about 500 feet of landing before it suddenly shot back up and disappeared.

A second officer confirmed the sighting and said the object disappeared before it reached the runway.

Produced by: Manoj Kumar

In 1973, Ingo Swann claimed to psychically “visit” Jupiter from a chair in California—and eerily described rings and atmospheric crystals years before NASA probes confirmed them. Coincidence, or something deeper?

Forget spy satellites. The CIA bankrolled Swann's brainwaves, hoping he could read enemy secrets using nothing but his mind. Welcome to Project Stargate: America's strangest Cold War weapon.

Before Swann, “remote viewing” didn't exist—not as a term or as a CIA-sanctioned skillset. He not only coined it but crafted a system so compelling, military intelligence took notes—and kept funding.

Swann wasn't just a psychic; he painted his visions. His cosmic artworks, blending psychedelia and prophecy, now hang in the Smithsonian—otherworldly images pulled from the mind's eye, not a telescope.

Born in Telluride, Colorado, Swann grew up amid mountains and mysticism. As a child, he reported out-of-body experiences and aura sightings—long before anyone handed him a clipboard or CIA badge.

In his cult classic Penetration, Swann suggests extraterrestrials are watching—and perhaps walking among us. With government agents, UFOs, and telepathic battles, it reads like sci-fi. But he insisted it wasn't.

At Stanford Research Institute, Swann underwent controlled psychic experiments with physicists Hal Puthoff and Russell Targ. Results were so strange, even skeptics couldn't look away. Neither could the CIA.

Swann described faint rings around Jupiter in 1973. Voyager 1 confirmed them in 1979. He said he saw them in a trance. NASA saw them with a billion-dollar probe. The timeline still baffles researchers.

Swann called it “projecting consciousness.” To him, the mind was a telescope, able to travel galaxies without rockets. While critics scoffed, intelligence agencies quietly took notes—and kept the files classified for years.

Five years after the conclusion of Supernatural, fans of the long-running fantasy TV show are still very active, expressing their love of the series and an interest in a continuation in the future. This devotion is exemplified in the fandom's excitement for Misha Collins and Jared Padalecki to reunite with co-star Jensen Ackles on The Boys, though the season is not set to be released until 2026. Viewers of the series are so dedicated that they are interested in anything concerning the main cast members.

Fans of Supernatural have various reasons to love the narrative, from the iconic Winchesters and other lovable characters to the multifaceted storyline. Some viewers adore the light-hearted humor or intense drama of the show, and others appreciate the horror and paranormal aspects. However, there are some episodes, especially in the earlier seasons, that are more terrifying than most others. Some viewers can't bring themselves to rewatch these installments, finding them too creepy and horrifying to revisit.

In Season 1, Episode 8, "Bugs," Sam and Dean investigate the strange happenings of an Oklahoma housing development where bugs are killing people. At first, they suspect that a teenage boy with a fascination with bugs might be responsible. However, they learn that the killer bees, spiders, and beetles are a result of a Native American curse.

This early installment of the series is culturally insensitive towards Indigenous people by suggesting they are capable of dark magic, making it one of the most problematic Supernatural episodes. However, that's not the only reason viewers skip this bug-centric storyline. The depiction of bugs attacking and killing victims is stomach-turning, especially for those with an aversion to the tiny beings.

At the beginning of Season 2, Episode 16, "Roadkill," the couple, Molly and David, are driving on a remote road at night when a man suddenly appears, causing them to crash. With David missing, Molly encounters the man she almost hit, who is a ghost, with a gruesome stomach wound and decaying face. She runs out, ending up in the road in front of the Winchesters' Impala, who are there to stop the brutal ghost killer.

This ghost narrative is a surprisingly heartbreaking story, especially when the audience reaches the twist ending and the emotionally charged final scene. In addition, it's one of the creepiest spirit episodes in Supernatural, featuring dark visuals and a violent villain. Some viewers can't stomach the gore and blood in "Roadkill" and skip it during a rewatch.

In Season 1, Episode 10, "Asylum," a couple of officers investigate a break-in at the abandoned Roosevelt Asylum, and one of them goes home to kill his wife, influenced by the evil spirits of the facility. Sam and Dean arrive to investigate the strange occurrences at the hospital, where a couple of college students have gone missing. They learn the vengeful spirits are patients who were tortured during their treatment, revealing that the true villain is the ghost of their horrible doctor.

It's unsettling when someone who is supposed to help people turns out to be the villain, and it's especially creepy when a dead doctor gets into the minds of the Winchesters, turning them on each other. The atmosphere of the abandoned building and the horrifying appearance of ghosts add to the scary quality of this episode. For some fans, the most terrifying antagonists are mangled apparitions.

In Season 1, Episode 7, "Hook Man," a killer is hunting victims in a sleepy college town, killing them with a sharp hook. When Sam and Dean investigate the slayings, they learn that the murders are connected to a sweet college student who is the daughter of a preacher. Eventually, they learn that the Hook Man is the evil spirit of a preacher who went on a killing spree with his hook back in the 1800s.

This takes from and expands on the lore of the killer Hook Man urban legend, creating an eerie narrative in which an emboldened preacher justifies his violent actions with religion. "Hook Man" plays out like a classic slasher film with the twist of the antagonist being a ghost. The elevated horror elements of this installment make certain viewers avoid a rewatch.

In Season 3, Episode 2, "The Kids are Alright," when Dean has a year before he goes to Hell, he convinces Sam to go with him to visit an old fling, Lisa, whom he hopes to romance once again. However, he gets sidetracked by Lisa's eight-year-old son, whom he initially believes might be his child. During this visit, Sam and Dean discover that changelings are in town, kidnapping children and feeding on vulnerable parents.

This is an important Supernatural filler episode, mainly due to the introduction of Lisa and Ben, who have a more significant impact on Dean's storyline later on. Aside from this, the changelings are some of the most memorable creatures in the show, appearing as children but having terrifying true forms that can be seen in mirrors. Certain viewers are particularly unsettled by creepy children and won't watch these stories a second time.

In Season 12, Episode 4, "American Nightmare," Sam and Dean investigate a case in which a couple of people die due to being whipped by an invisible assailant. The case brings them to a religious family living off the grid, who supposedly lost their daughter to an illness. However, it's revealed that the child was being held in the basement due to her psychic abilities being considered demonic, and she unintentionally hurt people trying to get help.

Occasionally, Supernatural embraces the Scooby-Doo method, revealing that the true villain isn't a ghost or monster, but a human with evil intentions. In this case, the psychic child is an innocent victim, and her religious extremist parents are the villains. The concept of religion-fueled crimes is hard for many viewers, and some fans can't rewatch this eerie representation of extremist harm.

In Season 2, Episode 11, "Playthings," the Winchesters investigate the strange deaths at a small inn in Connecticut, believing the tragedies are a result of dark magic. Soon, they realize that there is a dark spirit in the home trying to harm the proprietor's daughter. This child spirit, who was a long-dead family member, was trying to get the little girl to die so she wouldn't be alone in the afterlife.

This is arguably one of the hardest filler episodes of Supernatural to watch because it involves the harm of a child, but also a lonely child spirit. This ghost also had eerie similarities to the living child, which made some viewers think about the twin ghosts from The Shining. This creepy kid representation is another example of viewers being disturbed by child antagonists.

"Wendigo" is the second episode of Supernatural, but it's still an underrated Monster-of-the-Week episode often overlooked when discussing the best filler episodes in the series. In this storyline, Sam and Dean, picking up one of their dad's cases, investigate several missing person cases in Colorado. They learn the culprit is a wendigo, a creature that was once human but went through a change due to eating human flesh.

Some viewers don't appreciate "Wendigo" because it misrepresents the folklore from Indigenous culture, but it's also one of the spookier installments. The visuals in this early 2000s episode, despite being a little cheesy, were effectively creepy, especially the depiction of the humanoid monster. The backstory of the creature being a cannibalistic person unsettles some fans just enough to avoid this episode.

In Season 1, Episode 19, "Provenance," Sam and Dean look into the strange deaths that seem to surround an old painting of the Merchant family from 1910. After research, they learn that the entire family was murdered, they burn the remains of the father, Isaiah Merchant, who appears to be the murderous spirit. In a shocking turn of events, it's revealed that Merchant's adopted daughter, Melanie, was the evil spirit, and her father was trying to stop her.

There are many terrifying monsters in Supernatural, but oftentimes humans prove to be the most horrifying villains. Though Melanie is a ghost in the current plot of the episode, the audience learns that she killed her biological family before murdering her adoptive one. Creepy kids are one thing, but many viewers draw the line at murderous kids.

In Season 3, Episode 11, "Breakdown," Donna Hanscum, a sheriff the Winchesters previously worked with, asks for their help finding her missing niece. Helping out their friend, Sam and Dean discover an online website that sells human body parts to monsters. In their attempt to help Donna's niece and stop this business, they end up in a particularly dangerous situation.

The villain in this story is former FBI agent Terrance Clegg, someone who learned about monsters and chose to use this information to create a profitable business. This offers an alternate perspective on the hunters who dedicate their lives to stopping monsters. "Breakdown" is an entertaining later episode, but another one that creeps viewers out with the concept of the dark web and human body part sales.

Charlie Kirk, a right-wing activist, was shot dead at Utah Valley University. A video circulating online fuels conspiracy theories about hand gestures made before the shooting. Authorities believe the shooter fired from a rooftop. George Zinn was charged with obstruction. Donald Trump mourned Kirk and vowed to crackdown on political violence.

Pokémon Legends: Z-A is set to introduce multiple new Mega Evolutions to the Pokémon franchise, including Mega Dragonite and Mega Victreebel. In the past week however, official Pokémon social media accounts have become strangely obsessed with Malamar, a Dark/Psychic Pokémon from Pokémon X and Y. 

As it turns out, all of these shenanigans were due to another brand-new Mega Evolution: Mega Malamar, a Pokémon that has managed to hypnotise the entire world into Malamar-lovers.
