                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft executives explained why the company is mandating a stricter return-to-office policy during an all-employee town hall on Thursday, citing internal data that showed employees with more in-office time are "thriving." CEO Satya Nadella said the company observed through the pandemic that an "unintended consequence" of remote work was that social ties are "necessary for innovation," according to internal comments at the town hall, reviewed by Business Insider. That's it," Nadella said to employees on Thursday. "If you think of it as a simple network problem, that was the conclusion." Microsoft has tracked and analyzed data over the past few years and found that employees who spend at least three days a week in the office have a higher "thriving score," which Coleman explained means that the employee is energized, empowered, and finding meaning in their work. Coleman didn't share how Microsoft determines who is "thriving," but the company frequently surveys employee sentiment. Seattle-area Microsoft employees already average 2.4 days a week in the office, Coleman said. "So for some, this is not a big change," she said. For example, Microsoft AI has a stricter policy than the rest of the company, as Business Insider reported earlier this week. "It doesn't mean that we don't recognize the power of flexible work," Nadella said, adding that different teams will be able to set different terms for in-office work. "There's tons of empowerment here for people to go organize this in such a way that it works for the folks."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Discovery, according to people familiar with the matter. Discovery had yet to receive an offer as of Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic dealings. Shares of Paramount Skydance were up roughly 8% in afternoon trading. Discovery recently announced plans to separate its global TV networks business from its streaming business and studios. Earlier this week, WBD CEO David Zaslav said at an investor conference that the planned separation would likely be completed by April. The streaming and studio assets would be renamed Warner Bros., while the global TV networks business — which will own a suite of pay TV networks including TNT and CNN — will be Discovery Global. While WBD executives said in June that each company would be "free and clear" to do deals following the split, a bid before the separation would have to be for the entire company, one of the people said. The media industry has been navigating a transformation as streaming has upended the pay TV bundle, a longtime cash cow for TV and entertainment companies. A merger between Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. Paramount Skydance owns broadcast network CBS, as well as pay TV networks like BET, MTV and Nickelodeon, and streaming service Paramount+. Its film studio is known for movies like "The Godfather," "Top Gun," and "Forrest Gump." With the exception of a broadcast TV network, WBD has similar assets — with networks like CNN and TNT, as well as HBO and streaming service HBO Max. Its Warner Bros. film studio also has a historic track record, and owns the intellectual property to franchises like "Harry Potter," DC Comics and "The Lord of the Rings." Both companies have a long list of major sports rights, too, the marquee content for all traditional TV and streaming platforms. A merger would put the likes of the NFL, MLB, an array of college football and basketball, and other major sports under one roof. Media executives and experts have expected consolidation could be coming to the industry. Zaslav has said publicly for some time that media companies need to consolidate. During an earnings call in November, shortly after Donald Trump was elected as president, Zaslav said a new administration could usher in more dealmaking. However, in recent months, some media companies have moved toward separation. Late last year, Comcast announced that its NBCUniversal would spin off its pay TV networks, which includes CNBC and MSNBC, into a separate, publicly traded entity. Months later, WBD announced it would make the same move. Paramount Skydance is the result of an $8 billion merger that was announced last year and received regulatory approval in August to move forward after a lengthy delay. At the time of deal's approval, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said in a statement that he welcomed "Skydance's commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network." Last week, Paramount SKydance sent a memo to its employees saying they were expected to return to the office five days a week in the new year, or seek a buyout. A lot has changed since the merger, which was backed by RedBird Capital Partners. The company has done a slew of deals under the leadership of David Ellison, son of Oracle founder and multibillionaire Larry Ellison, including acquiring the U.S. rights to TKO Group's UFC for seven years, beginning in 2026. On Wednesday, Larry Ellison became more than $100 billion richer after software company Oracle issued growth projections that dramatically lifted the company's stock.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday announced it is issuing orders to seven companies including OpenAI, Alphabet, Meta, xAI and Snap to understand how their artificial intelligence chatbots potentially negatively affect children and teenagers. The federal agency said AI chatbots may be used to simulate human-like communication and intrapersonal relationships with users, and that it wants to understand what steps these companies have taken to "evaluate the safety of these chatbots when acting as companions," according to a release. "Protecting kids online is a top priority for the Trump-Vance FTC, and so is fostering innovation in critical sectors of our economy," FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said in a statement. Alphabet, Snap and xAI did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. The FTC said it is seeking information about how these companies monetize user engagement, develop and approve characters, use or share personal information, monitor and enforce compliance with company rules and terms of service and mitigate negative impacts, among other subjects. "Our priority is making ChatGPT helpful and safe for everyone, and we know safety matters above all else when young people are involved," an OpenAI spokesperson told CNBC in a statement. Character Technologies, which operates the Character.ai bot, and Instagram, which is owned by Meta, were also named in the release. Character did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Industry experts have said they expect the ethical and safety concerns to intensify once AI technology begins to train itself, creating the potential for increasingly unpredictable outcomes. Elon Musk in July announced a Companions feature for users who pay to subscribe to xAI's Grok chatbot app. In April, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said people are going to want personalized AI that understands them. "I think a lot of these things that today there might be a little bit of a stigma around — I would guess that over time, we will find the vocabulary as a society to be able to articulate why that is valuable and why the people who are doing these things, why they are rational for doing it, and how it is actually adding value for their lives," Zuckerberg said on a podcast. Last month, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., announced an investigation into Meta following a Reuters report that the company allowed its chatbots to have romantic and sensual conversation with kids. Meta made temporary changes to its AI chatbot policies following the Reuters report so the bots do not discuss subjects like self-harm, suicide, eating disorders and avoiding potentially inappropriate romantic conversations. Similarly, OpenAI outlined its plans to address how ChatGPT will handle "sensitive situations" last month after a lawsuit from a family blamed the chatbot for their teenage son's death by suicide.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lina Khan, the former chair of the Federal Trade Commission, told a roomful of founders and investors that poaching talent in billion-dollar deals still amounts to an acquisition by another name — and it could someday meet the same scrutiny as blockbuster mergers. "If these acqui-hires are being done in a way that is ultimately having a bad effect on competition, that is something that enforcers should be able to look at, and they should be looking at," she said during a talk at NYC Summit, an annual gathering of tech builders and investors hosted by the early-stage venture firm Primary. Big Tech isn't buying startups at the rate it used to. Meta hired Scale AI's Alexandr Wang after investing $14.3 billion in the data labeling startup. Google picked off Windsurf's chief executive and top researchers for a $2.4 billion licensing fee. Microsoft gutted Inflection, Amazon raided Adept, and so on. The deals appear to share a common goal: close quickly and dodge watchdogs. Khan made clear in New York that regulators aren't fooled. In May, the Justice Department said it was investigating whether Google violated antitrust laws through a pseudo-acquisition of Character.AI, a popular chatbot company. One year earlier, the FTC opened a probe into a Microsoft deal to hire Inflection's cofounder and almost all of its employees. Such deals could also gain more scrutiny in Europe.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Klarna employees are about to get a big payday — and it could come sooner than expected. The Swedish fintech company is giving employees a rare chance to cash out their equity during the IPO window, Business Insider has learned. In an email to current and former staff on Wednesday, the company said it is converting vested restricted stock units, or RSUs, into tradable shares, which employees can begin selling a few days after the $15 billion IPO. Klarna didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Exemptions like this are rare in public offerings, but not unheard of. When Airbnb went public in 2020, it gave employees the chance to sell up to 15% of their holdings in the first week of trading. Usually, IPOs come with lockup periods that bar insiders from selling shares for about six months. Klarna's email also detailed the conversion rate: roughly four RSUs will equal one publicly tradable share. Current employees will be allowed to sell during the initial IPO window until September 30; after that, trading will be limited to quarterly windows. Stock awards, such as RSU grants, have long been a key part of compensation in the tech industry, adding to base salaries and bonuses to make up total earnings. Klarna does not specify in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission what portion of the ordinary shares it is offering will be sold by employees. They retreated after that initial pop, closing the day 15% higher than its open at just under $46. Its plan to debut in April was pushed back after US tariff announcements caused market volatility. The listing has provided returns of more than $1 billion each to investors Sequoia Capital and Heartland A/S. At Wednesday's market close, the shares of Klarna cofounders Sebastian Siemiatkowski and Victor Jacobsson were also worth more than $1 billion each.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The tennis legend has built Serena Ventures into a $111 million fund that claims stakes in 16 unicorns, or startups valued at more than $1 billion. On Wednesday, Williams and Beth Ferreira, a Serena Ventures general partner, headlined NYC Summit, a staple of conference season for two thousand tech builders and investors, hosted by early-stage venture firm Primary. This year's lineup featured former FTC chair Lina Khan, policy-savvy venture capitalist Bradley Tusk, and the founders of leading artificial intelligence startups, including Decagon, Clay, and Cohere. Tech has always been a game of haves and have-nots, but the divide is starker as big acquirers pull back, venture firms raise smaller funds at a slower clip, and most dollars chase artificial intelligence. For everyone else, cash is harder to come by — and founders are weighing more carefully whether an investor brings more than money to the table. "Founders," Ferreira said, "are really evaluating who they want to partner with. If they don't believe that our network and the ideas we have about their company can change outcomes, we're not going to get into the deal." "I think most of the time," she added, "those founders are realizing that this is different and could very much complement the rest of their investment base." Ferreira says the firm comes in early, takes modest positions, and doubles down only when portfolio companies show breakout potential. In some cases, she added, the fund has even approached portfolio startups valued in the billions to cash out some of their shares. Williams said the firm is cutting fewer checks than it did three or four years ago, reflecting today's more cautious market. Serena Ventures now digs deeper into each startup, pressing on whether founders are genuinely solving the problem they set out to address. That extra scrutiny, she added, is a healthy shift — forcing both investors and founders to be more strategic about where dollars go. Since taking a step back from tennis, Williams has grown a business empire that stretches from cosmetics and media to stakes in pro sports teams. In an X post on Monday, she called a news headline "inaccurate" for saying she personally invested in a women's basketball league, clarifying that the move came from her fund. "I remain a partner at Serena Ventures, not in an operational role," she wrote. Her previous bets include Glossier, Warby Parker, Daily Harvest, and MasterClass. Looking ahead, Williams said Serena Ventures still has capital left from its $111 million debut fund. Williams made one thing clear: the firm isn't a one-and-done experiment. "We are not here to do one fund," she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wall Street is beginning to worry that, for some troubled users, AI chatbots and models may exacerbate mental health problems. There's even a phrase for it now: "psychosis risk." "Recent heartbreaking cases of people using ChatGPT in the midst of acute crises weigh heavily on us," OpenAI said in a recent statement, after being sued by a family that blamed the chatbot for their 16-year-old son's April death by suicide. "We're continuing to improve how our models recognize and respond to signs of mental and emotional distress and connect people with care, guided by expert input," the company added. This week, Barclays analysts highlighted a recent study by researcher Tim Hua that attempted to rate which AI models were better, and worse, at handling these delicate situations. "There is still more work that needs to be done to ensure that models are safe for users to use, and guardrails will hopefully be put in place, over time, to make sure that harmful behavior isn't encouraged," the Barclays analysts wrote in a note to investors on Monday. When evaluating whether models direct users toward medical help, OpenAI's gpt-oss-20b and GPT-5 stood out, with 89% and 82% of responses urging professional support. Only 5% of responses from Deepseek-chat (v3) encouraged seeking medical help. These AI models were scored based on how much they pushed back against users. The study also looked at whether AI models encouraged delusions. Here, DeepSeek-chat (v3) came top, suggesting it encouraged more delusions. Kimi-k2 ranked at the bottom implying better performance on this assessment. Finally, the study assessed AI models based on a composite of nine therapeutic-style metrics, including fostering real-world connections and gentle reality testing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ghana has become the latest African nation to accept deportees under President Donald Trump's immigration policy, with 14 West African migrants arriving in Accra following their removal from the United States. President John Dramani Mahama confirmed that a group of 14 deportees, among them Nigerians and one Gambian, had already arrived in Accra as per Reuters According to him, the Ghanaian government immediately facilitated their transfer back to their respective home countries, underscoring the nation's role as a temporary transit hub rather than a final destination. Mahama did not set any limits on how many deportees Ghana would accept, but defended the arrangement by pointing to the country's regional obligations. “We were approached by the U.S. to accept third-party nationals who were being removed from the U.S., and we agreed with them that West African nationals were acceptable because all our fellow West Africans don't need a visa to come to our country,” he told reporters. His remarks highlighted the ease of movement within West Africa, while also signalling Accra's willingness to cooperate with Washington's push to expand deportation partnerships. During a July 2025 meeting at the White House with the presidents of Mauritania, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau, and Liberia, U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of African nations hosting migrants, presenting it as part of broader discussions on trade, security, and development. While several nations, Rwanda, Uganda, South Sudan and Eswatini, have agreed to similar arrangements, others, such as Nigeria, have resisted, arguing that the deals would not be politically or legally feasible. Yet, the policy has drawn criticism from migrant advocates and human rights groups who warn that many deportees face uncertain or even dangerous conditions in their host or transit countries. It also raises questions about how far African states are willing to cooperate with Washington's immigration agenda and what safeguards, if any, will be in place for the deportees themselves.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Africa recently condemned the actions of Russia against Ukraine via a statement from the country's Department of International Relations and Cooperation. DON'T MISS THIS: Ramaphosa engages Putin on Russia-South Africa bilateral agenda, Ukraine peace process The attack seemed to have struck a chord with fellow BRICS member, South Africa, which noted that it was ‘deeply concerned' about the scale of violence being perpetrated, as seen on Bloomberg. “South Africa is deeply concerned about the indiscriminate attacks on civilians emanating from a Russian attack, which killed pensioners.” This is hardly the first time Pretoria has spoken against Russian actions, as South Africa, in August, decided to look into reports of Russian companies targeting young women for overseas work that may be supporting Moscow's war in Ukraine through drone factories. This was evident when South African President Cyril Ramaphosa welcomed his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, to his first-ever visit to Africa. “South Africa not only calls for a de-escalation and ceasefire, but also implores all parties to the conflict to abide by international law,” the statement said. “These breaches of international law escalate current global tensions.” Within 48 hours, each leader had updated Ramaphosa about the ongoing conflict. On August 7, President Ramaphosa spoke with Putin in response to the Russian leader's offer to brief him on the Ukrainian peace process and explore areas of mutual interest. The Kremlin leader expressed admiration and gratitude for South Africa's involvement in advancing peace talks, a notable concession from a regime that has repeatedly dismissed outside mediation as futile or biased. Ramaphosa was briefed on Ukraine's position on the peace process during his phone conversation with Zelenskyy, according to a statement from the South African presidency. The Ukrainian leader praised South Africa for its ongoing aid in pursuing a peaceful resolution and emphasized Kyiv's commitment to creating long-term peace.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oracle posted blockbuster gains on Wednesday, and the rally may not be over, according to equity analysts at Jefferies. The surge in Oracle's stock price came after the software giant shocked Wall Street with a record $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, or RPO — a measure of contracted future revenue — in its fiscal first quarter. Following the earnings release, Oracle's New York-listed stock closed 36% higher at $328.33 on Wednesday — its best one-day performance since 1992. Those eye-popping gains could be a sign of more to come for the $922 billion company. "We see room for the stock to grind even higher as optimism builds around the outlook," wrote Jefferies' analysts in a Wednesday note. This would represent a compound annual growth rate of nearly 70% from 2025 and outpace consensus forecasts by more than $50 billion. Meanwhile, Oracle's multicloud database revenue surged more than 1,500% year over year, which Jefferies said underscores the robust adoption of its multicloud strategy. Still, not everything met consensus in Oracle's first quarter. Revenue rose 12% year-over-year, shy of Wall Street's 13% forecast. Software and infrastructure as a service growth also came in under consensus. Oracle raised its capital expenditure forecast to $35 billion for fiscal 2026 — a 65% jump that mirrored an acceleration in infrastructure investment. "The increase illustrates persistent supply constraints amid surging demand, particularly from AI workloads," wrote the analysts at Jefferies. They warned that the ongoing AI infrastructure build-out is likely to compress margins going forward. Even so, Jefferies said those near-term pressures are outweighed by the company's huge backlog and accelerating demand for AI workloads.</p>
