                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tucker Carlson published a new interview with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Wednesday in which the two men discussed some pretty dark topics. Altman also talked about his beef with Elon Musk, and it wasn't long before the Tesla CEO chimed in on X with his own thoughts, definitively claiming that a whistleblower at OpenAI “was murdered,” in a tweet Thursday. During the episode, Carlson and Altman talk about Suchir Balaji, a researcher at OpenAI who died on Nov. 26, 2024. Balaji had accused OpenAI of violating U.S. copyright law a few weeks prior to his death. Carlson had Balaji's mother, Poornima Ramarao, on his podcast back in January and insisted that the 26-year-old whistleblower was murdered during his conversation with Altman. “So you've had complaints from one programmer who said you guys were basically stealing people's stuff and not paying them. “Also, a great tragedy, he committed suicide,” Altman said. Carlson pressed Altman, asking if he really thought Balaji killed himself. “Why does it look like a suicide?” Carlson asked. It was the—this is like gruesome to talk about, but I read the whole medical record. Does it not look like one to you?” Altman said. Carlson said he definitely thinks it was murder, saying there were signs of a struggle, “surveillance wires had been cut,” among other evidence he believes proves there was foul play. Carlson also told Altman that Balaji's mother “believes he was murdered on your orders.” Altman asked Carlson if he believed that, and Carlson tried to avoid answering before saying, “I believe that it's worth looking into.” Carlson insisted, “I'm not accusing you at all,” after Altman started to say something about being accused and was cut off. “You understand how this sounds like an accusation…” Altman says. “And I don't understand why the city of San Francisco has refused to investigate it beyond just calling it a suicide.” Altman said that “his memory and his family deserve to be treated with a level of respect and grief that I don't quite feel here.” Carlson shot back that he was asking at the behest of his family. Carlson pivoted to talking about Elon Musk and his attacks on Altman, asking what the “core” of their dispute might be about. Altman talked about how he's grateful to Musk for helping him start OpenAI. As Altman puts it, Musk has tried to “slow us down” ever since he got pushed out, filing lawsuits and claiming that OpenAI is betraying its original mission. When they weren't talking about Musk, suicide, and murder, things still got very heavy. Carlson repeatedly asked Altman about his religious beliefs. Altman said that he's Jewish, which wasn't enough for Carlson, who kept probing about whether he believed in God. “I asked because it seems like the technology that you're creating or shepherding into existence will have more power than people… on this current trajectory,” Carlson said. The former Fox News host badgered Altman about where he gets his “moral framework” if not from a higher power. It's actually a bit baffling that Altman agreed to do this interview, given the way that Carlson discusses AI and tech leaders on his show. Carlson often talks about them as godless freaks who are trying to build their own god in the machine. And Altman seemed at times blindsided by the questions about topics like suicide, where Carlson clearly tried to portray Altman as cold and out of touch with the morality of everyday people. “The unsettling part of this technology—not just your company, but others—is that I don't know what it stands for, but it does stand for something. And unless it admits that and tells us what it stands for, then it guides us in a kind of stealthy way toward a conclusion we may not even know we're reaching.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against Uber, accusing the ride-hailing company of violating federal law by discriminating against people with physical disabilities. In particular, the Department of Justice's (DOJ) civil rights division claims that the company and its drivers “routinely refuse to serve individuals with disabilities, including individuals who travel with service animals or who use stowable wheelchairs.” “Despite the importance of its services to people with disabilities, Uber denies people with disabilities full and equal enjoyment of its services in several critical ways,” lawyers for the DOJ wrote. This has caused “significant economic, emotional, and physical harm to individuals with disabilities,” the DOJ argues. Uber has long faced accusations that its services are discriminatory toward people with physical disabilities. The company ultimately reached a settlement with the DOJ in 2022 where it paid out millions of dollars to more than 65,000 affected users. Uber has also been hit with a number of personal lawsuits from passengers who've alleged similar discrimination and faced public protests. According to the complaint, after Uber became aware of this, the company rolled out a feature where passengers could self-identify that they were riding with service animals. This story has been updated with a statement from Uber. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops. He previously worked at The Verge, where he also covered consumer technology, hosted many short- and long-form videos, performed product and editorial photography, and once nearly passed out in a Red Bull Air Race plane.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Far-right influencers and violent extremists are posting identifying details about people they view as celebrating or glorifying the murder of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. One of the first names listed on the sites was Rachel Gilmore, an independent journalist at Bubble Pop Media who wrote on X that she was “terrified to think of how far-right fans of Kirk, aching for more violence, could very well turn this into an even more radicalizing moment. Will they now believe their fears have been proven right and feel they have a right to ‘retaliate,' regardless of who actually was behind the initial shooting?” As WIRED reported, this is exactly how much of the far right—along with Republican lawmakers including President Donald Turmp—did respond to the news, even though no suspect had been arrested and no motive had been revealed. “This website has me genuinely afraid for my safety,” Gilmore tells WIRED. “I feel awful for anyone whose name is on it. Gilmore has received multiple death and rape threats since the site went live on Wednesday evening. (WIRED reviewed screenshots of emails and direct messages Gilmore has received to verify the threats.) “I have folks claiming my information is all over 4chan telling me in the same breath that they hope I get ‘raped and killed' and telling me to ‘have fun walking the streets of' my city, which they name.” At the time of publication, two dozen people were listed on the site, with many entries including full names, employment details, location, and social media accounts. The site's operators, who are anonymous, claim to have received “thousands” of submissions. “All of them will be reviewed and uploaded shortly,” a note on the website reads. The website asks people to submit a potential target's full name, location, and employer information, as well as screenshots of incriminating social media posts, via email. This website is a lawful data aggregator of publicly-available information. It has been created for the purposes of public education.” We firmly denounce all political violence and criminal activity.” Many of the allegedly incriminating posts WIRED reviewed did not glorify or promote violence. “And the world kept spinning,” another person listed on the site wrote in a Facebook comment, under a post about Kirk's death. Quinn Huddleston, another name listed on the site, told WIRED he has received “countless messages” since his name was published on the site, some urging him to take his own life. Huddleston also says that people have threatened his life, claiming to know where he lives. “I don't believe political violence is the answer to anything on either side. They took a comment I made prior to [Kirk] even passing and now, as radicals usually do, spin it to work for their agenda, whatever that may be.” “I will be spending my night making everyone I find online who celebrates his death Famous, so prepare to have your whole future professional aspirations ruined if you are sick enough to celebrate his death,” Loomer wrote on X hours after Kirk's death. “I hope this dumb bitch is fired,” Loomer wrote, alongside a video showing her calling the woman's place of employment and speaking to her manager. “I can't imagine somebody that sick celebrating the death of a young father, who has children who are never going to know their father, working at the kids' club there,” Loomer said during the call. While Loomer was hoping to get someone fired, it appears Raichik succeeded. Shortly after she highlighted that the assistant dean at the office of Student Care and Conduct at Middle Tennessee State University wrote on her Facebook page that she had “zero sympathy” for Kirk, the woman was fired. “The comments by this employee, who worked in a position of trust directly with students, were inconsistent with our values and have undermined the university's credibility and reputation with our students, faculty, staff and the community at large. Another target of Raichik's was a firefighter at the New Orleans Fire Department who has since deleted her Instagram account and Facebook page. The New Orleans Fire Department did not respond to a request for comment. “The Patriot Oasis,” a far-right news account that spreads disinformation, also used its large following to direct threats and hate toward others online. As is typical in situations like this, the account shared inaccurate information about targeted individuals. In one case, the account highlighted a video posted to Instagram by a woman who said that she was “really glad Charlie Kirk got himself fucking shot.” This woman, the account said, worked at Larkin Community Hospital. Despite this, another far-right account suggested on Instagram that she had been fired. Tarrio, who had his sentence for seditious conspiracy with regards to the January 6 Capitol riot pardoned by Trump earlier this year, targeted a member of staff at a school in Miami, claiming he posted a comment on Instagram that celebrated Kirk's death. Karma,” the person wrote according to a screenshot shared on X. Tarrio tells WIRED he is not concerned about threats that people being targeted are receiving and claims he had succeeded in getting five people fired by Thursday afternoon. When asked for details about those people, Tarrio did not provide them. The Proud Boys are focusing our efforts into these threats and celebrations,” Tarrio says. “Someone could get killed or, if the harassment they're receiving is anything like what I've gotten, even engage in self-harm,” Gilmore said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell today announced a “responsible AI plan” that provides guidelines for the municipality's use of artificial intelligence and its support of the AI tech sector as an economic driver. The new plan includes directions for AI training and skill-building opportunities for city employees, as well as a framework to facilitate and evaluate the use of AI tools in city operations. Prior to today's announcement, Seattle already had policies requiring “human-in-the-loop” oversight, where employees must review generative AI outputs before official use and attribute any AI-assisted work to the specific technology. An investigative series published last month by Cascade PBS, a public news organization, found that multiple Washington cities have limited guardrails around AI use, raising public trust and privacy concerns. Seattle policy also names AI applications that are prohibited for city operations, such as in hiring processes and facial recognition products, due to concerns about the tech's performance and potential biases. Seattle leaders said they're trying to strike a balance that makes good use of the new technology, but doesn't compromise their fundamental obligations in serving the public. “We have big challenges related to homelessness, housing production, public safety, those types of things,” Lloyd said. “There's a lot of things that we can do successfully using the [AI] tools, but trust is our first measure.” The city has identified 40 priority projects in which AI could potentially improve government performance and public services. The project with CivCheck is “going quite well,” said Leah Tivoli, Seattle's director of Innovation and Performance. The technology can scan thousands of permit applications for omissions and other issues that require resubmission, flagging common errors so they can be addressed and prevented. The city's ultimate goal is to reduce permitting times by half. The intention isn't to replace city employees with technology — an approach that contrasts with tech leaders such as Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who has cited AI efficiencies as enabling workforce reductions. Other cities and local governments in Washington are likewise partnering with Seattle startups to deploy AI-supported services. The updated AI initiative was shared by Harrell and his team ahead of a city-led Community Innovation Hackathon being held this afternoon at Pier 70's AI House, a new startup hub partially funded by the city. Today's event is the Youth Connector Hackathon and focused on strategies to better connect Seattle's students with the city's 15 youth programs, which offer mental health and other support services.

They say they autopopulate fields based on field type, but address fields are common to have an autocomplete feature enabled. That would require transmitting data before submitting the form.

The article does talk about one example which is not considered wiretapping: a Google search field with autocomplete that's intentionally embedded in the web page.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple's AirPods Pro 3 are here, and with their arrival comes a lot of questions. One of the big questions after Apple's annual iPhone event is, “Should I buy new AirPods right now?” But before you can answer that, it's important to know the competition, and the main one is Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2. While both bear the “Pro” moniker in their names, they're not created equal, and small differences in features could have a big impact on which pair you ought to buy. While I haven't gotten to hear Apple's AirPods Pro 3 for myself yet, these wireless earbuds have a new architecture that Apple says should bring some improvements over the last generation. How demonstrable that change is remains to be seen, but it should be the best-sounding pair of AirPods yet, if Apple's messaging is any indication. Similarly, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 mark a significant boost in sound quality over the original iteration, with 11mm drivers that help augment both high and low ends. Which architecture delivers better sound quality will come down to preference, and we won't know for sure until we try AirPods Pro 3 for ourselves, but both should be the best-sounding version in their respective product lines. Apple is promising some big improvements gen-over-gen with active noise cancellation (ANC), claiming that its AirPods Pro 3 have 2x the ANC capability as the AirPods Pro 2. Apple generally offers better-than-average ANC (it's not Bose QuietComfort Ultra, but it's good), so double the ANC is an enticing offer. That should make a very tight seal in your ear and provide good passive noise cancellation on top of ANC. Again, it's hard to say without hearing the AirPods Pro 3 for ourselves, but there's a chance that AirPods Pro 3 could have an X factor here. AirPods Pro 3 now have an 8-hour battery life outside of the case with ANC on, which is two more hours than the AirPods Pro 2. While AirPods Pro 3 have a 24-hour battery life in the case with ANC on, Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 have 30 hours. Case battery isn't the biggest metric for success, but more is more when it comes to battery. While both wireless earbuds have AI integrations (Google has Gemini, and AirPods Pro have Apple Intelligence), conversation detection, support for head gestures, and adaptive ANC, and even live translation abilities, Apple's AirPods Pro 3 lean into health sensing as well. AirPods Pro 3 introduces a heart rate sensor that allows the wireless earbuds to be used for tracking workouts and even calories burned, while Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 have no such health features. Maybe Google will close the gap with its next pair of wireless earbuds, but for now, Apple has the advantage, especially if you're using an iPhone. Apple clearly spent a lot of time redesigning its AirPods Pro 3. Specifically, Apple says that it used “over 10,000 ear scans with more than 100,000 hours of user research” to tweak the fit of AirPods Pro 3. With that said, we gave the Pixel Buds Pro 2 high marks for comfort, so Apple has its work cut out. Apple does objectively now have more eartip sizes than Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2—five instead of Google's four—but that doesn't necessarily mean they're more comfortable, even if they do have more fit options. If I were a betting man, I'd put my money on Apple in the fit metric, if just because they seem to have exhaustively redesigned the AirPods Pro 3 and focused on the weight and feel. What's notable is that Apple didn't raise the price of its wireless earbuds, making the AirPods Pro 3 feel like a solid deal. Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 are almost exactly a year old at this point, and while $230 isn't the most expensive starting price for wireless earbuds, it's not a massive discount.

CoMotion last year moved into a new building on the UW campus in Seattle. The office helps researchers launch startups and secure patents for their discoveries. It also offers co-working space and runs several incubators, including a new fintech program. Former President Ana Mari Cauce, who stepped down this summer, said in May that she expected the university to make layoffs due to the budget hole.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The House committee met to discuss the commerce, justice, and science budget bill, which allocates funding to federal agencies like NASA. Congress's deadline to finalize individual appropriations bills—October 1—is fast approaching. Although the report didn't specify an amount of funds that should go toward these missions, it suggests they have broad support from the committee. “The Committee supports NASA's request to establish a regular cadence of science-driven, lower-cost mission and hosted instrument opportunities to Mars,” the report reads. The committee also recommended that NASA deliver these new missions and instruments alongside its commercial partners. Chandra, which launched in 1999 as the world's most powerful x-ray telescope, has been delivering high-resolution data on black holes, supernovae, and galaxy clusters ever since. The administration's budget request, however, called for its termination. The White House's proposed budget for 2026, released in May, would reduce NASA's funding by $6 billion compared to 2025. That would kill dozens of active and planned missions, including New Horizons. The spacecraft, which launched on January 19, 2006, traveled 9 billion miles in nine and a half years , becoming the first mission to reach Pluto. Hailed as one of the most successful planetary missions, it revealed that the icy planetessimal and its moons are far more complex than scientists had initially assumed.

During a press conference today, NASA presented findings from the initial analysis of a Martian geological sample, touting it as possibly "the clearest sign of life that we have ever found on Mars." The recently discovered interstellar object 3I/Atlas is set for a close flyby of Mars in October, where it can be observed by orbiters around the planet. A former NASA administrator testified that it was “highly unlikely” the agency would win the new space race unless something changes. Canada's first lunar rover will search for water at the Moon's south pole as part of an international effort to establish a sustainable human presence there. A new executive order excludes NASA and other agencies from their collective bargaining rights, citing national security reasons. We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Along with an ultrathin iPhone Air and other redesigns, the new phones come with a less flashy upgrade that could turn out to be the true killer feature. A security improvement called Memory Integrity Enforcement combines always-on, chip-level protections with software defenses in an effort to harden iPhones against the most common—and commonly exploited—software vulnerabilities. In recent years, a movement has been steadily growing across the global tech industry to address a ubiquitous and insidious type of bugs known as memory-safety vulnerabilities. When developers—even experienced and security-conscious developers—write software in ubiquitous, historic programming languages, like C and C++, it's easy to make mistakes that lead to memory safety vulnerabilities. That's why proactive tools like special programming languages have been proliferating with the goal of making it structurally impossible for software to contain these vulnerabilities, rather than attempting to avoid introducing them or catch all of them. “The importance of memory safety cannot be overstated,” the US National Security Agency and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency wrote in a June report. “The consequences of memory safety vulnerabilities can be severe, ranging from data breaches to system crashes and operational disruptions.” The company says it has been writing new code in Swift for years as well as attempting to strategically overhaul and rewrite existing code in the memory-safe language to make its systems more secure. And while, in general, Apple's locked down ecosystem has so far succeeded at preventing widespread malware attacks against iPhones, motivated attackers, particularly spyware makers, do still develop complex iOS exploit chains at high cost to target specific victims' iPhones. Even with the work Apple has done to begin overhauling its code for memory safety, the company has found that these rarefied attack chains virtually always still include exploitation of memory bugs. “Known mercenary spyware chains used against iOS share a common denominator with those targeting Windows and Android: they exploit memory safety vulnerabilities, which are interchangeable, powerful, and exist throughout the industry,” Apple wrote in its Memory Integrity Enforcement announcement on Wednesday. But Memory Integrity Enforcement itself was originally inspired by work at the hardware level to protect code integrity even when a system has suffered memory corruption. With memory-unsafe programming languages underlying so much of the world's collective code base, Apple's Security Engineering and Architecture team felt that putting memory safety mechanisms at the heart of Apple's chips could be a deus ex machina for a seemingly intractable problem. Arm developed MTE as a tool to help developers find and fix memory corruption bugs. Apple's engineers wondered whether MTE could run all the time rather than just being used as a debugging tool, and the group worked with Arm to release a version of the specification for this purpose in 2022 called Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension. To make all of this a constant, real-time defense against exploitation of memory safety vulnerabilities, Apple spent years architecting the protection deeply within its chips so the feature could be on all the time for users without sacrificing overall processor and memory performance. But Apple says that it has been able to thread the needle. Researchers who participate in Apple's special device program will also be encouraged to test and attack Memory Integrity Enforcement in the new version of the devices that contain A19 series chips. Apple has often been criticized for how restrictive its walled-garden ecosystem can be, including when lack of transparency prevents security researchers from fully vetting Apple's systems. But the approach has also proved effective in many ways. “Security can be effectively built-in from the ground up when properly designed.” In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each day The material on this site may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, cached or otherwise used, except with the prior written permission of Condé Nast.</p>

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Microsoft has released ISO install media for Windows 11 version 25H2, the next feature update in its annual release cycle. As of September 10, official ISOs are available via the Windows Insider download page, providing testers with a clean install path ahead of the update's general availability later this year. This is the same approach that Microsoft has used in previous fall updates, such as 22H2 and 23H2, and allows for a smaller, faster update that leaves core system components untouched. The ISO release provides users with more control over how and when they upgrade. Instead of waiting for Windows Update to deliver the patch, testers can perform an in-place upgrade by mounting the ISO or carry out a full reinstall by creating a bootable media with tools like Rufus. As Windows Central reports, the ISO file weighs in at around 7 GB, depending on language. On managed Enterprise and Education devices, admins can now uninstall a curated list of Microsoft Store apps, part of the company's broader effort to streamline business deployments. Depreciated legacy tools like PowerShell 2.0 and WMIC have also been removed. 25H2 support will begin at general availability and not during the preview period. Once 25H2 is officially released, it will reset that clock, meaning testers who adopt it now will eventually get a longer runway for security features and updates. Microsoft hasn't provided an exact launch date for 25H2, but if past timelines are any guide, general availability will likely land in October, lining up with the usual cadence.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. A mere 20 minutes or so after firing up the new All-Clad Gas Pizza Oven—the beloved pot-and-pan brand's first real foray into outdoor cooking—the oven's temperature gauge has gone deep into uncharted territory. The dial's markings top out at around 900 degrees Fahrenheit, but the thermometer's needle is somewhere in no man's land, well above what might register as a thousand if its thermometer weren't busy shrugging. My infrared temperature gun seems inclined to agree, depending where I point it inside the oven, though the surface of the All-Clad's thick 16-inch pizza stone is still hanging manageably below 900 degrees. Consider this an announcement: All-Clad did not come to play. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. (See WIRED's guide to the best pizza ovens.) All-Clad is making a case that new ideas are still out there. The oven's big sell, aside from its gaping 16-inch maw, is a rotating pizza stone that's meant to take a lot of the fuss out of cooking pizza evenly. The lower-cost Versa 16 from Halo, which I'm currently testing, also offers a rotating stone.) Once I cooled the oven back down into more reasonable temperatures, I have used this All-Clad to make pies both neo-Neapolitan and New York, baked pies from fresh and frozen alike, seared a handsome ribeye steak, and cooked veggies that ranged from charred to even more charred. But first, I want to talk about the oven's most salient feature: that rotating pizza stone. It's likely to be especially attractive to first-time pizza makers, and those who turn out a lot of pies rapidly. Most pizza ovens heat from a single primary source. And so pizza brands like Ooni have devoted considerable effort to modeling the interior domed shape of their ovens. But in practice, there will always be an unavoidable temperature gradient, even as you turn the flames down to cook your pizza. And so when baking a pizza in most backyard ovens, a turning peel will end up being your closest friend. On a Neapolitan-style pie cooking at above 800 degrees Fahrenheit, you might turn a pie four times in the 90 seconds or so your pizza takes to bake fully, reaching into and out of the oven with your long pizza spatula. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. It is a process that requires constant attention, maybe even love. For many home pizza cooks, the process of meticulously monitoring and turning their pie to ensure an even bake is a lot of the art and fun of making pizza. But let's say you'd rather just stick the pizza in the oven, then pull it out when it's done? That's what the lazy Susan in this All-Clad is for. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. If you start this rotation while the oven is preheating, the stone will also heat up beautifully evenly across its surface. And so when you lay your pizza down to bake, instead of poking and turning and guessing, you can simply watch the browning happen—and pull your pie at the right moment. By the time you actually pull your pizza, 10 or 15 seconds later, this perfection will likely have spread across the entire rim of your pizza. God bless: It's a feature I was truly grateful for. An extra motor is also probably an added failure point, I'll grant—a worry somewhat assuaged by the All-Clad's two-year warranty. Aside from this elegant spin and its capacious diameter allowing for 16-inch pizzas, the All-Clad will probably remind you of a lot of other high-end propane pizza ovens on the market. The pewter-black, stainless steel oven is handsomely minimalist, if a bit boxy compared to dome-ier competitors—with a prominent All-Clad badge in the front and handy fold-up legs for less bulky storage. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. It's priced for luxury, originally listed at a hefty $1,300. But in practice, the All-Clad has been discounted by as much as $500, bringing it in line with other high-end competitors like the 18-inch Ooni Koda 2 Pro. Assembly is nearly nil: About 50 percent of putting the thing together is just untucking the four legs that serve as its stand. Otherwise, one must simply add a couple buffer stones and center the hefty 16-inch cordierite stone atop its metal perch. Attach a propane tank, press down on the dial to trigger the igniter, and run the oven through a heating cycle to get rid of whatever factory dust remains. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The oven is neither too heavy nor overly light, about 46 pounds, if you plan on carting it into and out of storage. But for that, it's pretty well insulated. And as mentioned, the All-Clad heats up quickly. Heating the stone may take a little longer, but there's blessedly little lag between thinking about pizza and making a pizza. But every virtue can also be a flaw. The high power and fast heat-up on this All-Clad can mean it's easy to overshoot your target if you blast the thing on high—which then means you'll need to wait a bit to cool it back down. I've found it's better to heat the thing up at two-thirds intensity, rather than risk going way over the top. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Dialing in the right temp is more difficult for lower-temperature pizzas like New York or thin-crust pies that might be cooked below 700 degrees. This oven loves to be hot, and so “lower” temperatures like a mere 650 degrees do require some fine-tuning. Don't throw away your infrared thermometer, which you'll still need to monitor the surface temperature of your pizza stone. Now, does too much power amount to a damning flaw, especially if you're a lover of the two-minute Neapolitan? There are also a couple caveats with the rotating stone. (Note you'll need to wait to do this until your dough cooks enough on the bottom that you can actually lift it.) Mostly this has not been a problem. But mistakes happen, and rotating stones aren't a foolproof recipe for even cooks. At least once, I mounted the stone just a little askew and didn't notice until I had already heated up the oven—and this was just enough to offer friction while it turned, causing rotation to stall with my pizza on top. These are small complaints when lined up against the convenience of not having to futz with a turning peel. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's plenty of uncertainty to go around this year, including a global trade war, shifting policy priorities, and an economy that's starting to stumble. Breakthrough Energy, a climate tech organization founded by Bill Gates, has also been shifting in response. The group always placed long bets, though it appears to be reappraising some of them. Its policy team was scrapped in March, for example, and it didn't continue funding a publication that covered the climate tech world. It consists of 45 fellows at 22 different startups, and its makeup reveals how the program is evolving both in response to its own data and to global uncertainty. “It's the most global [cohort] that we've had to date. Grosh and her colleagues had to sift through around 1,500 applications and referrals, making the program more selective than the world's top universities. By way of example, she points to the fact that several cohort members are working on hydrogen. Circularity, or recycling materials back to their original form, or better, is also a priority for the region, given its role as a global factory and all the waste that entails. The new cohort also has startups working on critical minerals, agriculture, and grid modernization. Using a framework called techno-economic analysis, they work with “business fellows” — often entrepreneurs with relevant experience — to determine whether and where their idea can find product-market fit. “We were seeing a lot of companies come in thinking that they're going to do one thing, and then they pivot,” Grosh said. “They're more venture bankable once we've helped them through that pivot and validated it.” Grosh said that nearly all of the teams from the previous four cohorts have raised follow-on funding, and one, Holocene, has already exited. “That's a huge measure of success for us,” she said.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. This is a tool that allows Windows 11 testers and tinkerers to pare down Microsoft's latest OS into the bare minimum. Nano11's extreme pruning of the official installer disk image from Microsoft produces a new ISO “up to 3.5 times smaller” than the original. Before we talk anymore about Nano11, please be warned that it is described as “an extreme experimental script designed for creating a quick and dirty development testbed.” It could also be useful for Windows 11 VM (virtual machine) tests, suggests its developer. In this app, the intrepid developer sets aside a meager 20GB virtual disk for the installation; other settings seem to be left at their defaults. The installation moves pretty quickly, but we think the video is also sped up a little to reduce viewer tedium. At around 8m 34s into the video, there's a demo of the kind of Windows 11 you end up with after its Nano11 processing. Some of the social media postings suggest that, when following in NTDEV's Nano11 footsteps, you will end up with as little as a 2.8GB Windows 11 install footprint. However, this will depend on the 'flavor' of Windows 11 you start with, and there is also a little bit more work to be done to achieve the minimum size.

Ever since Apple started to develop its own smartphone processors, it has consistently offered the fastest system-on-chips for handsets, and more recently, these SoCs have even challenged CPUs for PCs when it comes to benchmark scores. The new six-core Apple A19 Pro does just that: it beats its predecessor, it leaves no chances for its arch-rival Snapdragon 8 Elite, and even conquers desktop-grade CPUs in the single-thread Geekbench 6 benchmark. In addition, the processor seems to pack the highest-performing smartphone GPU, offering performance comparable to that of GPUs for client PCs and tablets. The latest A19 Pro smartphone CPU from Apple scores 3,895 points in single-thread Geekbench 6 tests, outpacing its predecessor by 11% and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite by 36%. In addition, the new chip leaves behind all stock processors for client devices, including Apple's own M4 (by 5.3%) and AMD's mighty Ryzen 9 9950X (by 11.8%). Given Apple's focus on performance efficiency, it is not surprising that the new SoC beats everything in single-thread workloads. Apple's A19 Pro SoC features two high-performance cores operating at up to 4.26 GHz (+6.5%) and featuring improved branch prediction (higher performance in branch-heavy workloads and better power efficiency) and increased front-end bandwidth (which points to higher instructions-per-cycle, but does not indicate how many instructions the core can decode per cycle) as well as four energy-efficient cores that now boast with a 50% larger last level cache compared to the predecessor. The A19 Pro processor is made by TSMC on its N3P fabrication process, which is an optical shrink of N3E that enables a 4% higher transistor density as well as a 5% performance increase at the same power or a 5% - 10% power consumption reduction at the same frequency compared to N3E. However, given the fact that Apple uses a vapor chamber cooling system and an aluminum unibody chassis for its iPhone 19 Pro, it is surprising that the company did not increase CPU clocks more significantly to get higher peak performance. Perhaps the company decided to focus on workloads that are branch-heavy and/or benefit from higher IPC more than from sole frequency; it looks like these enhancements do not significantly improve performance in Geekbench 6. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. At the presentation of its A19 Pro, Apple did not reveal anything about improvements to its GPU, but said that it still has six clusters. Based on Geekbench 6 results published so far, the A19 Pro GPU is a whopping 37% faster than its predecessor. It is also comparable to the performance of AMD's Radeon 890M integrated GPU. The Apple A19 Pro GPU shows the highest performance advantages over its predecessor in Background Blur (relevant for depth-of-field in games, real-time multi-layer compositing, video background blur, etc.) and Gaussian Blur (relevant for post-processing, vision processing, FPU operations).
