                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fans were aghast, but citing the “absolutely horrible” treatment of directors, and claiming that “films don't matter” any longer, he said he was going to concentrate on being a full-time painter. The Christophers revolves around reclusive artist Julian Sklar, played with exquisite wit and care by Ian McKellen. If the film was nothing but simply a showcase of his immense talent to prance around half-naked in a robe, shouting out insults and melancholically raging about his diminishing abilities, it certainly would be enough. A series of Sklar's unfinished paintings are to be surreptitiously completed by an expert restorer using the brushes and paints from Sklar's studio, essentially creating new works worth millions that could be pocketed by the kids. The restorer in question, sent in under the guise of being Sklar's new assistant, is Lori Butler, played with a quiet grace and intense stare by Michaela Coel. As McKellen throws his tantrums, she watches with bright eyes and pursed mouth—the gaze of an acute observer. It's a difficult balance, to appear silently active rather than passive during these bouts of abuse from the elderly artist. There's little in screenwriter Ed Solomon's blockbuster filmography that would lead one to believe he'd have a delicious little chamber piece in him, but gifted writers can surprise at any stage of their careers. Still, the jump from the likes of Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure, Men In Black, and Now You See Me to this far more intimate drama does feel unexpected. Yet what ties all those projects together are exceptionally realized characters in extreme circumstances, their wit and humanity shining through no matter what is transpiring around them. That playfulness is balanced and complicated by the profound sadness behind Sklar's irascibility. The Christophers is an old man's film, to be sure, but the notions of loss and regret are shared in deeply empathetic ways by Lori's own journey. Their shattered confidences echo on another, and while the broken pieces can't be fully reformed into something new and beautiful, kintsugi-like, much can be gleaned from simply refusing to suffer in silence alone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you live in Nashville, you never know who might be leading worship at your church on a given Sunday. Thrive Worship put up an Instagram video of none other than Carrie Underwood on stage at the church, belting out the band's “Pour Your Spirit Out,” backed by a large group of worship leaders. The “American Idol” judge sang the lyrics, “Just believe that it can happen / There's a miracle right behind that stone / Roll back that stone / He's been waiting can you hear it / He's been knock knock knocking / Roll back that stone / Roll back that stone / Just like Lazarus out of that grave / Our God re-writes history / Jesus you change everything / When you pour your spirit out.” In the Instagram post's, Thrive Worship wrote, “Is this real life?? We are so thankful to see how God is using this song in His church. What an honor ❤️” The video has a caption over it that reads, “POV: Carrie Underwood leading worship with a song you wrote. According to Taste of Country, Carrie Underwood does not lead worship at Rolling Hills on a regular basis. Bethel posted a video of the performance on its Instagram account, writing, “Carrie lead worship @rollinghillscommunity church this morning. This was a sweet surprise and it blessed me so much. And this past Christmas, Carrie got up on stage at Rolling Hills once again to sing “O Holy Night.” “It wasn't announced she would be there, so we were surprised. Carrie Underwood even put out a gospel album titled “My Savior” in 2021. The album includes 13 gospel songs and classic hymns like “How Great Thou Art,” “Blessed Assurance,” “Amazing Grace,” and “Victory in Jesus.” Carrie also sang “How Great Thou Art” on American Idol during their “Songs of Faith” night.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A24's R-rated Dwayne Johnson movie The Smashing Machine arrived on three week tracking looking quite buff this AM with an outlook around $20 million when it hits theaters on Oct. 3. Johnson stars opposite Emily Blunt in a story about mixed-martial arts and UFC champion, Mark Kerr. Following the pic's North American premiere at TIFF, reviews on Rotten Tomatoes stand at 80% fresh with Deadline's own Damon Wise exclaiming, “Dwayne Johnson owns the whole thing with his truly remarkable work as fighter Mark Kerr, disappearing so fully underneath Kazu Hiru's astonishing prosthetics.” 'The Smashing Machine' Duo Benny Safdie & Dwayne Johnson To Reteam On Hot Package 'Lizard Music' - The Dish Dwayne Johnson A Smash In Venice As 'The Smashing Machine' Gets 15 1/2-Minute Ovation Smashing Machine‘s first choice is best with men over 25, followed by women over 25 (a serious component of Johnson's fanbase). Overall first choice is ahead of A24's Civil War, the studio's record stateside opener at $25.5M. Should Smashing Machine‘s projection hold, it will rank as A24's second highest debut ever at the domestic B.O. First choice is also quite close to that of 2023's Killers of the Flower Moon from director Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio; that movie opening to $23.2M during the actors strike when the cast couldn't promote. Should Smashing Machine hit its forecast, it will also be on par to another R-rated serious title that Johnson starred in back in 2013, Pain and Gain, opposite Mark Wahlberg. That movie, which followed Florida drug-taking bodybuilders immersed in an extortion ring, opened to $20.2M and finaled at $49.8M domestic and $87.3M global. Also going wide on Oct. 3 is IFC's horror movie Good Boy and Bleecker Street's erotic thriller, Bone Lake. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Park has always been indiscriminate with its satirical targets, but the current season has been especially ruthless in taunting President Donald Trump and the MAGA crowd. In an unfortunate coincidence of timing, one episode that parodied right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk was scheduled to air a rerun on Wednesday September 10, the same day Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University. “These young college girls are totally unprepared, so I can just destroy them, and also edit out all the ones that actually argue back well. He called it “hilarious,” saying on TikTok (via The Hollywood Reporter), “We have a good spirit about being made fun of. We as conservatives have thick skin, not thin skin, and you can make fun of us and it doesn't matter.” Unlike the White House and secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem, Kirk was able to spin South Park‘s attention into a positive. According to The New York Post, a staffer from Kirk's Turning Point USA posted on Telegram, “Comedy has consequences. Is Mad Max or Police Story the greatest action franchise of all time?

The episode — titled “Got a Nut” — aired back on August 6 and was scheduled to air a re-run on Wednesday night, but the cable network owned by Paramount and Skydance pulled the episode after Kirk was fatally shot while speaking at Utah Valley University on Wednesday. Some conservatives, including at least one at Kirk's Turning Point USA, wrote on Telegram (via the New York Post), “Comedy has consequences. Charlie was targeted in the culture before he was targeted in real life.” Other right-wing figures have directed blame at “South Park” for the disturbing act of political violence as well. Related Stories ‘Mussolini: Son of the Century' Review: Joe Wright's Flashy Rise-of-Fascism Series Feels All Too Familiar ‘The Girlfriend' Review: Olivia Cooke and Robin Wright Wage War in This Psychological Thriller But Kirk himself was a fan of the episode after it aired, calling it “hilarious,” and saying he could tell “South Park” creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker had been watching some episodes of his show. He went on to refer to a Bible verse, of which he said the show “gets this right,” and showed a clip in which Cartman, with a haircut to resemble Kirk's own, becomes a “master debater” and fires back at a weepy college student…all while he's sitting on the toilet with his laptop. “There's going to be a lot said about this, but we need to have a good spirit about being made fun of. We as conservatives, we have thick skin, not thin skin, and you can make fun of us, and it doesn't matter,” Kirk said. “And until next time, I hope all of you become master debaters for truth,” with Kirk making sure he clearly pronounced each of those separate words in “master debaters.” The episode also showcased “The Charlie Kirk Awards” celebrating young people who have been “furiously master debating” and are using “master debation” to save America. The episode shows Cartman effectively becoming Kirk after he realizes another kid at school, Clyde, is very casually getting a huge following doing simple Prove Me Wrong videos, effectively stealing what has become Eric Cartman's calling card for the past 25+ years of television. This season of “South Park” has been all over the MAGA crowd, and its lampooning of Kirk was arguably tame in comparison to how it has depicted President Trump and the Trump administration's Kristi Noem in the same episode as Kirk. The show has also frequently shown Trump stripping down naked, mocking what they say is his small penis, and even showed an AI-generated Trump stumbling naked through the desert like a wandering messiah. While Kirk won't be the subject of the show's satire any further, don't expect Matt and Trey to hold back on others moving forward.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The complicated divorce between actor Scott Wolf, 57, and life coach Kelley Wolf, 48, took another surprising turn on September 10, 2025, as both parties arrived at a Utah courthouse for an emergency hearing — but Kelley showed up without legal representation, according to People. Scott, whose most recent starring roles have been in FOX's “Doc” and Hallmark's “A Merry Scottish Christmas,” attended the hearing with his lawyer, Bart Johnson, per Us Weekly, hoping the judge would put a full restraining order in place. Because Kelley did not have a lawyer present, the judge did not rule on any new matters and also ordered that Scott must help pay for a new lawyer for Kelley, Us Weekly reported. Scott was awarded temporary sole custody of the kids in late June. The order says Kelley cannot have any direct or indirect contact with her children and must remain at least 300 feet away from Scott. The former couple can, however, now communicate via phone, a source told People, because the judge said that's what best for their kids. However, neither party is required to answer the other person's call or text. Kelley must have a new lawyer by then, the judge said, and submit a letter from her attorney confirming he or she represents the former MTV star, per Us Weekly. Kelley's prior attorney, Farrah Spencer, withdrew her representation on August 19, according to Us Weekly. Kelley, who rose to fame on MTV's “The Real World: New Orleans” and “The Challenge,” was arrested on August 26 after posting Scott's cell phone number in her Instagram Stories amid a flurry of social media posts that concerned many fans. Kelley was charged with three misdemeanors, per People — one for electronic communications harassment and two charges of misdemeanor electronic disclosure of personal identifying information. Released after two days in jail on $5,000 bail, Kelley was ordered to attend a treatment program and told the judge on September 2 that she was “excited” to do so. People reported on September 7 that Kelley had already entered rehab. On Labor Day, according to TMZ, police escorted Kelley out of an Airbnb where she had overstayed her reservation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Video has given an official series green light to Bishop, an original thriller drama starring Joel Kinnaman. Kinnaman also headlines Apple TV+'s sci-fi drama series For All Mankind, whose upcoming fifth season is awaiting a premiere date. It is unclear whether he could do both shows. Apple TV+ has not said whether Season 5 of For All Mankind will be its last; the fate of Kinnaman's character on the alt-history space race drama is also unknown. All The Taylor Swift Songs In 'The Summer I Turned Pretty' So Far ... & Our Predictions On Season 3's Needle Drops In Bishop, homicide detective Bishop Graves (Kinnaman) – brilliant, battle-scarred – will put all of his skills to the test in the hunt for an elusive killer targeting San Francisco's moneyed class. As this increasingly audacious killer develops a devoted following among the city's powerless, Bishop becomes convinced these murders connect back to SF's most powerful man, his own father, Lincoln Graves. Over the summer, there were on and off conversations with an A-list actor for the Lincoln role, which ultimately fell through. Little Marvin serves as showrunner of Bishop, which he and Saltzman executive produce alongside Vertigo's Roy Lee and Miri Yoon. The project stems from Little Marvin's overall deal at Amazon MGM Studios. It is his second pilot script under the pact following Them. (The horror anthology drama Them ran for two seasons.) “Little Marvin and Tony Saltzman have created a truly electric crime drama,” Nick Pepper, Head of US SVOD TV & Development Series, Amazon MGM Studios, said. Paired with our outstanding collaborators Roy Lee and Miri Yoon from Vertigo, Bishop is poised to captivate and surprise our global Prime Video customers.” The Killing, Altered Carbon and House of Cards alum Kinnaman also is set to star opposite Elisabeth Moss and Kerry Washington in the upcoming Apple TV+ limited series Imperfect Women. He is repped by WME and Magnolia Entertainment. He is repped by Kaplan/Perrone and Miles Metcoff at Yorn Levine. Little Marvin is repped by WME, Blue Marble Management and Lichter Grossman Nichols Adler. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Evidently, all you may actually need is a roughly 400-mile road, a game cast of youngsters, and Mark Hamill, as director Francis Lawrence's latest hunger games, “The Long Walk,” is a grim and gripping late-summer treat coated in poison. It also helps that screenwriter JT Mollner (writer/director of last year's addictively twisted cast-and-mouse “Strange Darling“) has downed the material — a Stephen King, sorry, Richard Bachman-penned young-adult novel from 1979 — without a dose of saccharine hope. Adapted from the novel King wrote under a pseudonym to separate his writing from his by-then celebrity status, the dystopian thriller is set somewhere, some place, some time, in a post-Vietnam War middle America. In other words, a time that many who lived through that era and this one would say was the other worst time in American history, riven by panic and protest and government corruption laid bare. In this particular world, as a rebuke of a supposed “epidemic of laziness” spreading across its youth culture, the Long Walk challenge is established as a kind of compulsory draft: Enlist yourself, survive an endless trek without going under 3 miles per hour, and unimaginable riches await you at the other end if you're the last one alive. Meanwhile, Mark Hamill as The Major in aviator sunglasses is shouting at you with a megaphone to keep moving or else. He has his own agenda, packed later into the movie with close-to-the-source-material reverence to reveal that Raymond is coming of age in a time of authoritarian government control and censorship. His father (Josh Hamilton) suffered a bad fate at the hands of the regime's squadron after introducing spreading illicit political messaging and introducing his kid to the likes of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, oh my, and later in the movie, Ray may appear to be quoting Heidegger in describing how our individual deaths are the one thing that make us unique to each other as humans. Then, there's a creepy, reedy Charlie Plummer doing his best Caleb Landry Jones as Gary, #5, who goads other players into shedding down to their weakest points to eliminate them. Yes, there are several visceral shots of a Long Walker or two getting the runs on the way to their moving target of a destination, though, like the blood spewing with each squadron's unloading into a slowpoke, it's thankfully (but perhaps cheaply) all done with CGI. In the annals of movies about death races, “The Long Walk” is closest in misanthropic spirit to Sydney Pollack's shocking 1969 “They Shoot Horses, Don't They?,” with cinematographer Jo Willems applying a similar dustbowl aesthetic that tends toward the claustrophobic, intentional or otherwise. This unfussy, even dusty atmosphere makes “The Long Walk” feel all the more realistic or plainly ordinary, a dystopia both backwards in time and close to our own. “My dad was my hero,” Ray, who's left a widowed mother (Judy Greer) overwhelmed by grief back at home, tells Peter at one point. That notion, coming from Cooper Hoffman, of course brings to mind his own father, Philip Seymour Hoffman, giving the film an extratextual emotional dimension even as Cooper's performances are increasingly feeling like a far cry from his father's tortured, nervous souls and weirdos. This “Long Walk” indeed grows repetitive, its political message bluntly delivered in a finale that rewrites the book's ending and is here set so unsubtly to “America the Beautiful” that it makes the climactic shot of Brian De Palma's “Blow Out” look positively conservative by comparison. “The Long Walk” doesn't tell you or ask you anything new if you're feeling pent up with rage by American leadership these days, but the film's grim commitment to the bit is a rarity for a studio movie: There's no holding of your hand on this long walk, nor does it read you a bedtime story and tuck you in at the end. “The Long Walk” opens in theaters from Lionsgate on Friday, September 12.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A scheduled repeat of a recent episode mocking Kirk has been pulled from Comedy Central's rotation, while some on the right are taking aim at the show. In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, some conservatives are pointing fingers at South Park for mocking the conservative thought leader in a recent episode. The second episode of the current 27th season of Comedy Central's satirical hit — titled “Got a Nut” — had Eric Cartman becoming a right-wing podcaster and spouting tropes used by Kirk, who tours college campuses debating progressive students. “Who wants to debate the master debater?” demanded Cartman, who also took on Kirk's hairstyle and later attended a ceremony giving out “The Charlie Kirk Award for Young Masterdebaters.” 'South Park' Returns This Week With Butters in Hot Water The mockery was pretty tame by South Park standards (certainly kinder than its treatment of Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem in the same episode). After the episode aired, Kirk seemed thrilled and posted a TikTok (below) calling the episode “hilarious” and noted “South Park gets this right.” The Turning Point USA founder added, “We have a good spirit about being made fun of. According to the New York Post, one Turning Point USA staffer posted on Telegram, “Comedy has consequences. The Daily Beast spotted some other comments on social media: “Let's blame South Park. One “MAGA” labeled X account wrote, “I don't blame South Park. They aren't our leaders, representatives, mentors, pastors, example setters or societal caretakers. A few other episodes of South Park have been permanently pulled from distribution over the years due to controversial content. “Probably a smart decision, no matter your feeling on him; don't give either side reason to exploit this,” wrote one. While another opined, “You really can't fault them for not predicting this; I don't think anyone could have predicted this series of events with him literally talking about gun violence as he was being shot.” Given South Park has been on a tear going after President Trump and MAGA this season, and frequently pivots at the last minute to tackle current events in their episodes, it will be interesting to see what creators Parker and Stone focus on when the show returns next week amid its new biweekly rollout schedule this season. Kirk was speaking at a debate Wednesday hosted by his nonprofit political organization. Immediately before the shooting, Kirk was taking questions for an audience member about mass shootings and gun violence. “The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead,” President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been nearly two months since the death of hard rock icon Ozzy Osbourne. And while the Prince of Darkness shuffled off this mortal coil on July 22 at age 76 after completing a number of projects that will keep him in our hearts for a while, the first posthumous reminder of his lovably sweet/salty nature has come from a most unexpectedly wholesome place. “Hi Kelly,” Ozzy says to his daughter, beaming into the show remotely while seated in a brown leather chair, dressed in black, of course, with a number of gold necklaces on his chest and a sweet, bright smile on his face in a clip posted by Reality Club Fox. One of the young builders was confused, asking, “what? what is that?,” as his knowing mom explained, “it's her dad.” “Hi dad, we need someone to scare a few of the kids,” Kelly told Ozzy. Always up for a good scare, Ozzy mischievously grinned, “I'd love to!,” busting out a maniacal laugh as he rubbed his hands together. As the buzzing alert bathed the brick floor in a blood red light, Ozzy intoned, “You've got one hour left to finish those builds!,” wagging his finger ominously as he added, “Or else!” and a demonic laugh. The kids were appropriately freaked out as Kelly said, “Thank you, daddy. Celebrity partner Andy Richter laughed, “Oh Ozzy,” while one of the kid builders asked, “Who is that?” Another contestant helpfully explained, “It's Ozzy Osbourne. There will also be a feature-length doc covering Ozzy's six-year struggle to recuperate from a devastating 2019 fall, Ozzy Osbourne: No Escape From Now, slated to debut on Paramount+ later this year. First up, though, is the rocker's second memoir, Last Rites, which will drop on Oct. 7 through Grand Central Publishing/Hachette Book Group.

Steven Spielberg Heaps Praise on 'One Battle After Another,' Watched Movie 3 Times Box Office: 'Weapons' Wins Quiet Labor Day With $12.8M, 'Jaws' Beats 'Caught Stealing,' 'The Roses' It's just steps away from “Bruce,” the sole surviving full-scale shark model from Jaws that is often lovingly referred to as the museum's unofficial mascot. Also on view in the Marilyn and Jeffrey Katzenberg Gallery: Spielberg's annotated script, storyboards and original concept illustrations of the shark by production designer Joe Alves, composer John Williams' sheet music, sketches of a shark rising from the depths by Roger Kastel, the original Jaws clapper board from Spielberg's collection, the Panavision underwater camera used to shoot key scenes, a shark cage, a costume worn by Roy Scheider, original shark design schematics by design engineer Frank Wurmser, a prop dorsal fin, rare behind-the-scenes images and merchandise, and visual displays. Nobody could have predicted what a cultural phenomenon Jaws became, how it would influence moviemaking or how it would endure 50 years after its release. During her comments, Academy Museum director Amy Homma noted how a recent rerelease of the Universal Pictures title finished at No. “He has continually toppled his own achievements,” praised Homma, who shared the stage with senior exhibitions curator Jenny He. “That is a complete testament to his work, which stands the test of time. He has explored new themes and ideas, sometimes treating us to dazzling thrill rides, and other times guiding us through introspective journeys into our own histories, our dreams, and the depths of our own souls. American cinema and world cinema would not be the same over the past half century without Steven Spielberg.” Bonus: The orchestra featured two musicians who played on the original recording session, including Dennis Karmazyn on cello and Kaufman who played violin. As for those memories that he shared, Spielberg went back to the beginning and recalled how he “thought my career was over” halfway through production. This film is way over budget, way over schedule and you are a real liability as a director. You are not going to get hired again,'” said Spielberg, who was only 26 at the time of filming. But it took a while for that to happen. As has been exhaustively reported, the production faced one debacle after another. “I just really was not ready to endure the amount of obstacles that were thrown in our path,” Spielberg said Wednesday. “Starting with Mother Nature, my hubris was that I thought we could take a Hollywood crew, go out 12 miles into the Atlantic Ocean and shoot an entire movie with a mechanical shark. I thought that was going to go swimmingly.” “I was offered, actually, several times a chance to gracefully bow out of the film, not to be replaced by another director, but for the film to be shut down,” Spielberg continued, adding that the entire production went about 100 days over schedule. “We shot 158 days, but nobody wanted to quit. Give me an incentive to keep working on your movie. I didn't know when we were going to wrap until two weeks before we wrapped on Martha's Vineyard. “The camaraderie that happens when you're just trying to survive something, it brought all of us closer together. And the success of the movie gave me a chance to make any movie I wanted to make after that.” And the rest, as they say, is history. “I was offered several times to gracefully bow out of the film,” Steven Spielberg says of directing the troubled production of Jaws, which went on to become a smash hit and cultural phenomenon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bowen Yang praised his ‘Saturday Night Live‘ co-star and collaborator Heidi Gardner after her exit from the late-night sketch show. Gardner is one of several cast members not returning for Season 51. The show is losing Gardner, Devon Walker, Michael Longfellow, Emil Wakim, and John Higgins while gaining five new cast members. He singled out Gardner as a cast member who was trusted to write sketches solo. She would take it upon herself to write pieces for other cast.” He recalled a “Weekend Update” segment Gardner penned for former cast member Punkie Johnson. “It was one of the most beautiful, kindest gestures I've ever seen at that show, and her heart was so big, and clearly so fucking funny,” Yang said. “And that was this foothold that I had emotionally in terms of knowing we were just sharing music.” He called his former co-star “a truly beautiful person.” Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel Condemn ‘Monstrous' Charlie Kirk Shooting Death Justin Baldoni Accused of ‘Verbal Abuse' on Second Project: ‘I Had Repeated, Negative Interactions' Earlier this week, after a string of departures, Saturday Night Live confirmed its Season 51 cast, with Yang, Kenan Thompson, and Weekend Update co-hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che among those set to return. According to multiple reports, much of last year's main cast will be back at Studio 8H this fall, including Ego Nwodim, Chloe Fineman, Marcello Hernandez, Andrew Dismukes, Sarah Sherman, and James Austin Johnson (who, of course, handles the show's all-important Donald Trump impression). During season 49, she participated in more sketches than any other cast member, and she was the longest-tenured female cast member during Season 50. Gardner has yet to address her departure from the show. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Good evening, everybody,” Colbert said as he opened the late-night show. “After our scripts for tonight's show were finished, we learned that Charlie Kirk, a prominent right-wing activist, was killed at a speaking engagement in Utah. I am old enough to personally remember the political violence of the 1960s, and I hope it is obvious to everyone in America that political violence does not solve any of our political differences. And I pray with all my heart that this is the aberrant action of a madman and not a sign of things to come.” “Instead of the angry finger-pointing, can we just for one day agree that it is horrible and monstrous to shoot another human?” Kimmel wrote. The right-wing political influencer and activist, who co-founded Turning Point USA to foster a culture of conservatism on school campuses around the nation, was 31.
