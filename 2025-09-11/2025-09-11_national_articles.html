"In light of yesterday's horrific assassination of a leading political figure, I want to underscore that foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country," Deputy Secretary of State Chris Landau wrote on X. "I have been disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action. Please feel free to bring such comments by foreigners to my attention so that the @StateDept can protect the American people." Landau said in a subsequent post he would direct his consular officials to monitor replies to his X post calling out foreign nationals in the U.S. on visas who posted such rhetoric. In June, the State Department said it would monitor the social media posts of visa applicants and would instruct applicants to set their social media to "public." The State Department has already revoked over 6,000 student visas, because recipients had either overstayed visas or broken the law. The "vast majority" of legal violations were assault, driving under the influence, burglary or "support for terrorism." On Wednesday, Kirk, a 31-year-old conservative activist, father of two and co-founder of Turning Point USA, was fatally shot during a speaking event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. The event was part of his "American Comeback Tour," which drew a crowd of about 3,000 attendees. "In light of yesterday's horrific assassination of a leading political figure, I want to underscore that foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country," Deputy Secretary of State Chris Landau wrote on X. Kirk was addressing a question from the audience about mass shootings involving transgender individuals when a single shot struck him in the neck. The weapon, later recovered, was a high-powered bolt-action rifle found in a nearby wooded area. Authorities believe the shot came from a rooftop roughly 200 yards away.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump listens as names are read as they attend a ceremony at the Pentagon to commemorate the 24rd anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Thursday, Sept. 11, 2025, in Washington. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump marked 24 years since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks at a service at the Pentagon on Thursday. The 9/11 remembrances are being held during a time of increased political tensions after Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at a college in Utah. Trump sought to fire Cook Aug. 25, but a federal judge ruled late Tuesday that the removal was illegal and reinstated her to the Fed's board. Trump has accused Cook of mortgage fraud because she appeared to claim two properties as “primary residences” in July 2021, before she joined the board. Such claims can lead to a lower mortgage rate and smaller down payment than if one of them was declared as a rental property or second home. On Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the administration had not satisfied a requirement that Fed governors can only be fired “for cause,” which she said was limited to misconduct while in office. Cook did not join the Fed's board until 2022. Authorities installed security glass outside a Yankee Stadium suite on the third base side, over the dugout of the visiting Detroit Tigers, in preparation for Trump's arrival for tonight's game. Security around the stadium was tight even four hours before first pitch, with every entrance featuring metal detectors and Secret Service agents while NYPD helicopters thundered overhead. Flags for each of baseball's 30 teams that ring the stadium were lowered to half staff after Trump issued an executive order honoring slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Head Start associations in several states filed suit against the policy change by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The ruling by a federal judge in Washington state on Thursday comes after a coalition of 21 Democratic attorney generals succeeded in temporarily halting the policy's implementation within their own states. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Thursday that 1,001 agencies have signed 287(g) agreements, named for the section of a 1996 law that empowers local police make immigration arrests. States with no agreements include California, Illinois and New Jersey. The Trump administration is relying on local police to make immigration arrests while ICE sharply ramps up its own hiring to fulfill the president's promise of mass deportations. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau will visit South Korea, Papua New Guinea and the Marshall Islands beginning later this week as the Trump administration and Seoul attempt to extricate themselves from a complicated deportation situation and the U.S. tries to seal a deal with Port Moresby to accept migrant deportees from the United States. The State Department said in a statement Thursday that Landau would travel to Seoul, Port Moresby and Majuro between Friday and Sept. 18 “to underscore the United States' commitment to strengthening partnerships and alliances in the Indo-Pacific region.” The statement did not mention the crisis over the arrest by US immigration authorities of several hundred South Korean workers — who are now being repatriated — at a battery plant in Georgia. Metropolitan Police Department vehicles are pictured outside Democratic National Committee headquarters, Thursday, Sept. 11, 2025, in Washington. “As DNC Chair Ken Martin has said, political violence in every form has no place in our country,” the DNC statement said. Members of the U.S. Capitol Police are pictured outside Democratic National Committee headquarters, Thursday, Sept. 11, 2025, in Washington. U.S. Capitol Police are responding to a bomb threat at Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, according to a person familiar with the incident who requested anonymity because the situation is fluid. An email sent to Senate offices said that “staff are asked to remain clear of the police activity” and said more information would be forthcoming. An Arizona judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's effort to remove Guatemalan and Honduran children living in shelters or foster care after coming to the U.S. alone, according to a decision Thursday. U.S. District Judge Rosemary Marquez in Tucson extended a decision made over the Labor Day weekend. Lawyers for the children said their clients have said they fear going home, and that the government is not following laws designed to protect migrant children. A legal aid group filed a lawsuit in Arizona on behalf of 57 Guatemalan children and another 12 from Honduras between the ages 3 and 17. Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser remembered the victims from the city who died on 9/11 and praised the city's emergency first responders for how they reacted that day, and every day since. “We pray for their nearly 3,000 lives lost on that day, and the lives that have been lost since.” Trump, first lady Melania Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, attended the Thursday morning commemoration. A suspect on trial for attempting to assassinate Donald Trump while he played golf in South Florida last year forfeited his right to continue his opening statement on Thursday when a judge objected to his repeated talking about unrelated matters. Ryan Routh, representing himself, veered off topic, discussing Adolf Hitler and wars in Ukraine and Gaza during his opening statement in a Fort Pierce, Fla. courtroom. The Trump administration sued Maine in April for not complying with an executive order barring transgender athletes from sports. Crews wearing hardhats and green smocks have begun erecting metal barriers and tents for extra security screening, more than seven hours before tonight's Yankees game where Trump will be in attendance. Crews are working every entrance at Yankee Stadium. Secret Service agents have also begun arriving with sniffer dogs. The sniper who assassinated Charlie Kirk is believed to have jumped off a roof and fled into a neighborhood after firing one shot and has not been identified, authorities said Thursday in disclosing they have recovered a high-powered, bolt-action rifle they believe was used in the attack and are reviewing video footage of the person they believe was responsible. The FBI released photos of a person of interest in Kirk's shooting as investigators appeal to the public for tips. It remained unclear how far the shooter has traveled, though law enforcement officials say nearby woods where the rifle was found have been secured. A plane carrying more than 300 workers from South Korea who were detained during an immigration raid at a battery factory in Georgia last week left Atlanta shortly before noon Thursday, bound for South Korea. The workers traveled by bus from a detention center in southeast Georgia to Atlanta earlier in the day for their flight, which is expected to land in South Korea on Friday afternoon. South Korea's Foreign Ministry said the detainees released by U.S. authorities included 316 Koreans, 10 Chinese nationals, three Japanese nationals and one Indonesian. They were among about 475 workers detained during last week's raid at the battery factory under construction on the campus of Hyundai's sprawling auto plant west of Savannah. Trump made those remarks in a brief conversation with reporters as he left the Pentagon. “We will continue applying maximum pressure against those who threaten the security of the United States and the region,” Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, John K. Hurley said in a statement. The State Department is warning foreign visa applicants and holders that they could be denied a U.S. visa or deported if they praise or make light of the assassination of conservative American political activist Charlie Kirk. In an unusual post to X, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said he was personally “disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action.” Landau has been at the forefront of publicizing the revocations and denials of U.S. visas, having announced earlier this year that he had revoked visas for performer Bob Vylan and his crew after the British punk-rap duo led crowds in chanting “death” to the Israeli military. “In light of yesterday's horrific assassination of a leading political figure, I want to underscore that foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,” Landau said. He also asked social media users to copy him on any posts they might see that could be relevant. Chris Van Hollen and Jeff Merkey are calling on the Trump administration to take a harder line with Israel following a trip to the region last month to witness the conditions in Gaza. The senators issued a report that details the findings of their trip to the Gaza border and surrounding region, including that the Israeli government has too many restrictions on humanitarian aid entering Gaza and that the food distribution sites that are allowed are designed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to drive people from northern Gaza. “In our interviews and through our observations, it was clear that the Netanyahu government is also restricting the delivery of humanitarian assistance into Gaza, including using food as a weapon of war,” Van Hollen said. Israel's government has strongly denied accusations like that, saying Hamas is to blame for the the lack of food in Gaza. But the senator's report showed how support for Israel in its war against Gaza is eroding among congressional Democrats, many who've spent their political careers in support of Israel. The Secret Service has joined the Yankees in warning fans of very long security lines being likely for tonight's game, due to President Trump being in attendance. “If you are attending tonight's @Yankees game, plan on arriving early and consider leaving your bags at home to help speed up the security screening process,” the Secret Service posed on X. Gates are opening more than three hours before first pitch between the Yankees and Tigers in the Bronx at 7:05 p.m. His attendance at the U.S. Open last weekend in New York sparked very long security lines. Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a friend of Kirk, said his death “hits particularly hard.” Their last text exchange was a short time before Kirk's death, Lee said at a hearing Thursday of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Lee said the shooting also “hits home particularly heavy with me” because it occurred at Utah Valley University, a few miles from where he grew up and near where he now lives. Not the kind of place where you expect something like this to happen. The New York Yankees say ticketholders “are strongly urged to arrive as early as possible” due to extra security measure as the president attends tonight's game in the Bronx. The team said in a statement that gates open at 4 p.m., more than three hours before first pitch against the Detroit Tigers. It added that fans should also “budget extra time for entry due to enhanced security measures” at all Yankee Stadium gates. His visit to the men's final of the U.S. Open in Queens on Sunday sparked massive lines, long enough that some fans didn't make it to their seats for more than an hour into the match — despite organizers delaying the start by 30 minutes. So we'll see what happens,” Trump said in a brief exchange with reporters shortly after attending the a 9/11 memorial ceremony at the Pentagon. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, left, and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, both of New York, tell reporters that they are united as the Sept. 30 funding deadline approaches, at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 11, 2025. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for unity Thursday after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at an event in Utah on Wednesday. “The first reaction of everybody — everybody — should be to say, this is a horrible thing, we ought to come together and to not seek political advantage from it,” Schumer said at a news conference after a meeting with Jeffries over the upcoming spending deadline. Schumer said political violence is an “affliction” in the United States. Jeffries said the shooting “should be denounced by everyone, and moving forward, we have to figure out a better way to come together, not as Democrats or Republicans but as Americans.” House and Senate Democrats met Thursday morning to discuss government spending and said afterward that they'll push for improvements to health care in exchange for keeping the government open. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York, said after the meeting that they are united as the Sept. 30 funding deadline approaches. They didn't detail their specific demands from Republicans, but they've been pushing for an extension of heath care tax credits that will expire at the end of the year and for Republicans to undo cuts to Medicaid in their tax and spending cuts legislation enacted earlier this year. If Republicans don't engage in bipartisan negotiations, “they ‘ain't going to get the votes,” Schumer told reporters. The Pentagon chief, who spoke before Trump at Thursday's Pentagon ceremony, remembered the conservative activist as an “American patriot.” “Know that you have heard the Lord's words. Full heart, clear eyes, like those on 9/11, you will never be forgotten.” It came hours after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at an outdoor event at a Utah university. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Marking the solemn 24th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, President Donald Trump announced he will posthumously award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was shot and killed Wednesday afternoon at a Utah college event. Trump said he remained shocked by horror of Charlie Kirk's assassination during an appearance on Utah college campus and praised his ally's impact on conservative politics. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Thursday that security is “a big concern” for members of Congress and is under “a very thorough review.” But Johnson told reporters at the U.S. Capitol that he'd seen security estimates into the billions of dollars for all 435 House members, which he said is “not a possibility.” He did mention a pilot program through which members can be reimbursed for hiring private security when they're on the road or in their districts. “Somebody who's arguing the other side of an issue is not your enemy, they're your fellow American,” Johnson said, in a call for civility. “We're all made in God's image and so we need to see one another that way and not as enemies.” Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., waits in his office before a swearing-in ceremony for newly-elected Rep. James Walkinshaw, D-Va., at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2025. Johnson had just arrived from speaking about the shooting of Charlie Kirk, the CEO and co-founder of Turning Point USA. FILE - Easterseals Head Start program teaching assistant Tania Ortiz helps a student practice writing his name, Jan. 29, 2025, in Miami. A federal judge has blocked Trump administration restrictions on services for immigrants in the country illegally, including the federal preschool program Head Start, health clinics and adult education. Under the proposed changes, some community-level programs would be reclassified as federal public benefits, making them inaccessible to people without legal status. Individual public benefits, such as food stamps and college financial aid, have been largely unavailable to people in the country without legal status. U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy, who was appointed by Trump in 2019, said in her order that the policy rollout was “rushed” in a way that would worsen the impact for people cut off from community services and those tasked with verifying eligibility. ▶ Read more about the judge's order on Head Start The president was accompanied by first lady Melania Trump. At 9:37 a.m. on Sept. 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, killing 184 service members and civilians. Harvard University says it has started receiving notices that many federal grants terminated by the Trump administration will be reinstated after a federal judge ruled the cuts were illegal. It's an early signal that federal research funding could start flowing to Harvard after months of deadlock with the White House, but it's yet to be seen if money will arrive before the government appeals the judge's decision. So far, no payments have been received, though Harvard is “monitoring funding receipts closely,” spokesperson Jason Newton said. A federal judge in Boston last week ordered the government to reverse more than $2.6 billion in cuts, saying they were unconstitutional and “used antisemitism as a smokescreen” for an ideological attack. Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs and have mostly settled in a historically low range between 200,000 and 250,000 since the U.S. began to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic nearly four years ago.

(Lothar Speer via AP) Opening statements are set to begin Thursday morning for the trial of a man charged with trying to assassinate President Donald Trump while he played golf in South Florida last year, when he was campaigning for a second term. Ryan Routh is representing himself after U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon agreed to let him dismiss his court-appointed attorneys. They are, however, standing by in the courtroom if needed. He's pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and close ally of President Donald Trump, was shot dead at a Utah university event on Wednesday. The suspect is believed to have jumped off a roof and fled into a neighborhood after firing one shot and has not yet been identified, authorities said Thursday. The assassination drew bipartisan condemnation, but a national reckoning over ways to prevent political grievances from manifesting as deadly violence seemed elusive. White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles says the messages and calls to the president were from European and Asian leaders expressing condolences about Kirk. “Charlie was very much a part of this family and maybe the highest profile MAGA person outside of those that are working here,” Wiles said Thursday in an interview on the radio show hosted by Republican strategist Scott Jennings. “I think it shook everybody to their core,” she added. The post's authors also noted that Kirk was “no stranger to threats,” receiving “thousands of them throughout his life.” Prior to Thursday's post, Kirk's final X message had been several hours before he was shot Wednesday, concerning the stabbing death of a young Ukrainian refugee on a Charlotte, North Carolina, commuter train last month.

ET (12:45 p.m. MT) event, citing “rapid developments in our investigation.” Authorities said they would release an updated time later Thursday. A search for the suspect in Kirk's killing was ongoing and authorities have released images of a person of interest, as well as offered a reward for information and solicited help from the public. The assassination offers the latest example of how ordinary security measures can be defeated in an era of escalating political violence, when anyone associated with the political process is a potential target, including influencers. The conservative firebrand appeared with his own security team, as he has at scores of events on other campuses. In hindsight, those with experience protecting high-profile public officials and dignitaries say more could have been done to prevent the fatal shooting. ET (12:45 p.m. MT), officials in Utah are planning to give another update in their investigation into Kirk's fatal shooting at Utah Valley University. Earlier Thursday, state and federal officials gave details about a potential suspect and said they had video footage of the person. In the hours since, the FBI has released photos of a “person of interest” and a link to an online form where people can upload photos and video that could potentially be helpful to authorities. ▶ Read more about what other political leaders subject to violence are saying Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the nation's most prominent progressive voices, has postponed her visit to Raleigh, North Carolina, where she was scheduled to attend a rally with state Democrats on Sunday. She said the cancellation was because of security concerns. Ben Shapiro, a conservative influencer and political commentator who drew a similar audience to Kirk, canceled a book signing at the Ronald Reagan Presidential and other speaking engagements on his public calendar immediately following the shooting. Shapiro said in a post on X that he was “utterly stunned and heartbroken and sick to my soul” to learn of Kirk's death. Vance shuffled his schedule Thursday, nixing plans to attend a Sept. 11 commemoration in New York City and heading instead to Utah, where Kirk, his friend, was assassinated Wednesday. While in Utah, Vance and his wife, Usha, were to meet with Kirk's family and close friends, the person with knowledge told the AP. Afterward, Vance will fly Kirk's casket and family with him aboard Air Force Two from Utah to Arizona, where Kirk made his home. Temporary flight restrictions were issued earlier Thursday for both areas, indicated movements of a high-profile person, like Vance. “We're just here as a group to say America cannot govern itself this way,” GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham said to open a news conference Thursday, flanked by a mix of Democratic and Republican senators. GOP Sen. Katie Britt said Kirk has influenced many people, including her children. “Talking through this with them last night is just unthinkable,” said an emotional Britt. The news conference was to highlight a bipartisan push to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism and included Democratic Sens. Klobuchar highlighted multiple shootings that had happened in her own state of Minnesota this year, including the killing of a top Democratic state lawmaker. The FBI says it's offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the identification and arrest of whoever is responsible for Kirk's death. Officials also published the link for a form where people can upload videos and photos. FILE - Matthew Dowd, chief campaign strategist for the Bush-Cheney 2004 presidential campaign, speaks at the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service in Little Rock, Ark., Wednesday, Sept. 2, 2009. Dowd had said on-air that Kirk had made incendiary statements, and that “hateful words” can lead to “hateful actions.” Dowd later apologized, saying he in no way meant to imply Kirk was responsible for the attack, but the damage had been done. MSNBC President Rebecca Kutler said the remarks were inappropriate and insensitive. The once bustling halls and classrooms of Utah Valley University sat silent Thursday, save for some university staff and law enforcement guarding police tape in the hot sun. Television and newspaper reporters were set up for press conferences in the building just off the shooting site, but police officers guarded most views of the amphitheater, shaped like baseball's home plate, where Kirk had been speaking and taking questions from an audience of thousands the day before. Police barricades and tape is set up at Utah Valley University a day after Charlie Kirk was shot and killed, in Orem, Utah, Thursday, Sept. 11, 2025. Law enforcement recovered a Mauser .30 caliber bolt-action rifle hidden in a towel in a wooded area near the university campus along what they suspect to be the shooter's path as they fled the scene, according to information circulated among law enforcement and shared with The Associated Press. The weapon and ammunition are now being forensically analyzed by law enforcement at a federal lab for clues that could help identify the shooter or their motive. Thursday morning, the classrooms were quiet and in disarray. Backpacks and notebooks were left on the desks, some scribbled with notes on electromotive force in green pen and pink highlighter. The president said he plans to speak with Kirk's family on Thursday afternoon. Trump made those remarks in a brief conversation with reporters as he left the Pentagon.

Ebenhack, File) But they cancelled a Thursday night event in Santa Barbara featuring conservative commentator Ben Shapiro out of respect for Kirk and his family, Walker said. “We will review our security measures to ensure the safety of our students, speakers, and staff,” Walker said in a statement on the group's website. Doing so would mean that the evil assassin who did this wins. The Florida Republican honored Kirk and called for nonviolent political participation as he marked 24 years since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks at an event in Palm Harbor on Thursday. “The viability of a republic really depends on our ability to fight those battles in the proper arena, leading into voting, leading into debate,” DeSantis said. “It is certainly not that you kill somebody in order to silence them.” Students at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton plan to gather Thursday evening to honor Kirk, holding a memorial service and prayer vigil at the student union on the Palm Beach County campus. “May he rest in Peace,” the FAU Turning Point USA chapter posted on its Instagram account. The Republican said the death of his friend “hits particularly hard.” Lee said he talked with his fellow conservative “very regularly, sometimes several times a day.” Their last text exchange was a short time before Kirk's death, Lee said at a hearing Thursday of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Lee said the shooting also “hits home particularly heavy with me” because Utah Valley University is just a few miles from where he grew up and near where he now lives. Not the kind of place where you expect something like this to happen. The other 13 include Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. The remaining 36 states allow colleges and universities to keep concealed firearms off campus, according to the anti-violence organization Everytown for Gun Safety. In May, after action by the Utah legislature, a law took affect that allows anyone at least 18 years old with a valid Utah concealed weapon permit to carry a weapon on campus, including in an “open” fashion. The State Department is warning foreign visa applicants and holders that they could be denied a U.S. visa or deported if they praise or make light of Kirk's assassination. In an unusual post to X, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said he's personally disgusted by some posts he's seen, and that consular officials have been directed “to undertake appropriate action.” “In light of yesterday's horrific assassination of a leading political figure, I want to underscore that foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,” Landau said. He asked social media users to copy him on any posts they see that could be relevant. Earlier this year, Landau announced that he had revoked visas for British punk-rap performer Bob Vylan and his crew after they led crowds in chanting “death” to the Israeli military. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., joined at left by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., calls for unity a day after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at an event in Utah, at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 11, 2025. “There should be no finger pointing because this is an attack on our democracy itself,” Schumer said. Saying the attack on Kirk was “heinous, cowardly and would make everyone sick to their stomachs,” Schumer also decried the 2017 shooting that wounded current House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and “the politically motivated murders” of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband this year. Investigators are confident they will find the shooter, said Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason. Two other people initially detained turned out to be uninvolved and were released. So we'll see what happens,” Trump said in a brief exchange with reporters shortly after attending the a 9/11 memorial ceremony at the Pentagon. A batch of 911 traffic released Thursday from the Utah County Department of Public Safety via Broadcastify includes callers describing seeing a person on campus wearing “jeans, black shirt, black mask” and carrying a “long rifle.” During a news conference on Thursday, law enforcement officials said they had obtained video footage of a suspected shooter and had recovered a high-powered, bolt-action rifle from the wooded area where the suspect fled. Full heart, clear eyes, like those on 9/11, you will never be forgotten.” At the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said “all Americans should come together and feel and mourn what happened.” The leaders spoke to reporters after a bicameral Democratic legislative meeting. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The United States' highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom is awarded by presidents to people who have made significant contributions in a variety of areas, including culture and public service. In his first term, Trump bestowed the honor to a number of people, including conservative firebrand commentator Rush Limbaugh. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Thursday that security is “a big concern” for members of Congress and is under “a very thorough review.” But Johnson told reporters at the U.S. Capitol that he had seen security estimates into the billions of dollars for all 435 House members, which he said is “not a possibility.” He did mention a pilot program through which members can be reimbursed for hiring private security when they're on the road or in their districts. “Somebody who's arguing the other side of an issue is not your enemy, they're your fellow American,” Johnson said, in a call for civility. “We're all made in God's image and so we need to see one another that way and not as enemies.” The person who fatally shot Kirk is believed to have targeted him at an event on a Utah college campus, said Robert Bohls, the FBI Special Agent in Charge at the Salt Lake City field office. Law enforcement officials said the suspect they are seeking “appears to be of college age” and “blended in” with students on the college campus. Authorities said they have video footage of the suspected shooter but did not confirm that includes images of the person's face. Authorities found what they believe was the murder weapon, a high powered bolt-action rifle, in a wooded area where the shooter fled, said FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert Bohls. Mason said authorities tracked the suspected shooter's movements after he jumped from a building, moved through stairwells and ultimately fled from campus into a neighborhood. “We do have good video of this individual,” Mason said. Law enforcement officials have begun their news conference at Utah Valley University. Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason says officials will work Thursday to release Kirk's body from the medical examiner to his family. The Utah Department of Public Safety says its commissioner, as well as the FBI special agent in charge, will speak to reporters at 9 a.m. ET on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem. Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, are set to visit with Kirk's family on Thursday in Salt Lake City. According to a person familiar with Vance's plans, but not authorized to speak about them publicly, the Vances will visit Utah instead of New York, which had been their planned destination for an outdoor ceremony to commemorate Sept. 11.</p>

The White House issued a rare public rebuke of Israel for its strikes on Hamas leaders in Qatar, putting Washington in an awkward position between two key allies. The Trump administration almost never breaks publicly with Israel on military campaigns. But analysts say the deeper question is how much the U.S. knew in advance and whether it quietly offered its blessing. A Qatari security official also died, underscoring the risk of escalation when Israeli operations spill into the territory of U.S. partners. "There's a lot of opaqueness when it comes to exactly what the United States knew and when," said Daniel Benaim, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. This kind of public statement by a U.S. president in the wake of a strike like this is already very notable in its own right." A damaged building after an Israeli attack on Hamas leaders, according to an Israeli official, in Doha, Qatar, Sept. 9, 2025. The timing has fueled speculation about whether the strike was connected to Washington's frustration with Hamas and whether Israel acted with at least tacit U.S. approval. "It just seems like the Israelis wouldn't have done this without him knowing," said Michael Makovsky, CEO of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America. But Trump had harsh words about the strike Tuesday, writing on Truth Social that it "does not advance Israel or America's goals." Qatar has denied getting any sort of advanced warning. If Washington knew in advance, why issue the rebuke? If it didn't, how could Israel act so freely in airspace dominated by the U.S. military? Either option raises uncomfortable questions about America's leverage. "Israel would not do what it did without some sort of an approval by the U.S.," said Dr. Yoel Guzansky, senior researcher and head of the Gulf program at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies. "The Trump administration wants to distance itself, and it's understandable, because it has good relations with the Qataris." The U.S.'s biggest overseas air base, Al Udeid, sits on Qatari soil and hosts more than 10,000 American troops. "If indeed the U.S. wasn't aware, then we have a big problem, because Israel surprised the U.S., and it might cause damage to U.S.-Qatari relations," Guzansky said. "The fact that U.S. defenses at Al Udeid were not used against Israeli jets is a great indicator that Washington was not opposed to the strike," Ahmad Sharawi, a researcher at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. But Qatar's international Media Office called claims that Qatar was reevaluating its security partnership with the U.S. "categorically false." Vehicles stop at a red traffic light a day after an Israeli attack on Hamas leaders, in Doha, Qatar, Sept. 10, 2025. "Gulf states are a bit less concerned about the threat from Iran, which was pushing them closer to Israel, and they're seeing that Israel is engaged in activities across the region, whether it's Syria or inside Iran or now inside Doha." Israel, meanwhile, is pursuing a strategy of direct confrontation with Iran across multiple fronts. "Gulf states that are really focused on their own economic recovery don't like the image of smoldering, smoking Gulf cities subject to bombs because they're trying to attract investment and create an image of common stability," Benaim said. "Israel is probably underestimating the power of Gulf solidarity and the barrier being crossed when you see Israel striking inside of a GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] state," one former senior State Department official added. "I don't think that means their relationships are going to fall apart or unravel, but these things cast a long shadow." Sharawi counters that Gulf outrage may be less about Israel itself than about the precedent of a strike on GCC soil. "It was an Israeli action against a fellow GCC partner despite the hostile relationship that countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE had with Qatar in the past," he said. "But Gulf leaders are also deeply critical of Qatar for hosting Hamas. Privately, many will understand why Israel acted, even if publicly they condemn it." For Qatar, the strikes open up both a vulnerability and an opportunity. On the one hand, it cannot allow itself to appear passive in the face of foreign attacks on its soil. Analysts expect Doha to respond through diplomatic channels, critical media coverage and perhaps limited economic measures against Israel. But Qatar also has a long history of turning crisis into relevance. "Qataris want to be again the mediator, because they earn a lot of points internationally — especially from the U.S.," said Guzansky. That means Qatar's public outrage may coexist with a return to shuttle diplomacy, positioning itself once more as indispensable to ceasefire negotiations. Sharawi argues that Qatar's victim narrative also obscures its complicity. "The leadership of a terrorist organization has failed to bring in a sustainable ceasefire, and Qatar has empowered Hamas by hosting them," he said. "Even though Gulf leaders won't say it publicly, they are very anti-Hamas. That context matters for how normalization prospects are viewed after this strike." Earlier this week Fox News' Brian Kilmeade told a Qatari spokesperson it sounded more like the nation was "taking Hamas' side" than playing mediator. "When one of the parties decides to attack our sovereignty in a residential neighborhood where my countrymen, the residents of Qatar, live in schools and nurseries right next door, believe me, it's very difficult to maintain a very calm voice," foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al Ansari said. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, has promised to strike "enemies everywhere" after strikes. The Doha strikes also highlight an asymmetry in Gulf reactions. When Iran struck Al Udeid Air Base earlier this year, Gulf solidarity with Qatar was muted. "You didn't see Gulf leaders coming and hugging the Qataris after Iran's strike," Guzansky noted. "They were overly critical of Israel compared to Iran," Sharawi said. The Arabs don't hesitate to latch onto anything that criticizes Israel, and that showed yesterday, even in comparison with Iran." Gulf leaders fear escalation with Tehran, but criticizing Israel carries little risk. The fact that Hamas leaders survived while a Qatari security official was killed may further complicate the fallout, heightening anger in Doha while leaving Israel's core objective incomplete. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has promised to strike "enemies everywhere." "There is no place where they can hide," Katz said in a post on X, raising questions about whether a sovereign nation like Turkey, a NATO ally, which houses Hamas senior leaders, may be next.

Will Cain breaks down the top stories, including how a Texas A&M professor was fired for pushing gender ideology. Plus, Kurt Schlichter joins Will to expose the lies of 2020 and why soft-on-crime policies fueled the Charlotte murder. Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles offered no comment on President Donald Trump's call to enforce the death penalty against Decarlos Brown Jr., the suspect accused of an unprovoked fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a light-rail line. "The animal who so violently killed the beautiful young lady from Ukraine, who came to America searching for peace and safety, should be given a ‘Quick' (there is no doubt!) Trial, and only awarded the death penalty. Trump wrote on Truth Social after Brown's capture. Lyles' office provided Fox News Digital a lengthy statement from the mayor highlighting the importance of proper transit safety, among other concerns, but declined to comment directly on Trump's demand. "The city has always partnered well with the Federal Transit Authority, including earlier this year for CATS' (the transit system) triennial review which was successfully completed," Lyles said. Lyles, a Democrat, said she will continue to look for bipartisan solutions to pressing problems like transit safety as mayor of North Carolina's largest city. Zarutska was killed on the Blue Line. "CATS will also deploy new security teams, including bike patrols and urban terrain vehicles in the coming weeks. Nearly 30 additional security personnel will also be added," Lyles said. After Brown allegedly killed Ukrainian refugee Zarutska, he complained to his sister that he "hurt [his] hand" stabbing her before asking rhetorically why anyone would "stab somebody for no reason." Brown also said it was the "material used in [his] body" that committed the crime and that the "material" should be investigated because "you know that's not me." His sister later added that the woman who was killed was from Ukraine or Russia and cited what she called a "war going on against the United States." North Carolina still has the death penalty on the books but has been under a de facto moratorium since its last execution in 2006 amid legal fights over alleged bias and pharmaceuticals used in lethal injections.

Fox News' Eric Shawn reports on the staggering rise in 9/11-linked cancer diagnoses from Ground Zero, including his own recent diagnosis from covering the terrorist attacks 24 years ago. On the 24th anniversary of the Sept. 11th attacks, Fox News correspondent Eric Shawn reported live on Fox & Friends from Lower Manhattan, where survivors, families, first responders and public officials gathered to honor the nearly 3,000 lives lost. During the segment, Shawn revealed he himself suffers from 9/11-related cancer. "I have two different diagnoses under the World Trade Center Program," he revealed, referencing the federal program that provides monitoring and treatment for survivors, responders and others directly affected in New York, at the Pentagon and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. "It is hard to believe that it has been nearly a quarter of a century since that day, when radical Islamic terrorism attacked the very heart of our city and our country," Shawn said. That has not diminished — and today, again, we all gather here to remember what was lost." Fox News' Eric Shawn disclosed his cancer diagnosis and bronchitis issues related to 9/11 toxic dust exposure. The tragedy extends far beyond that day, he emphasized. "While 2,977 people were murdered here that day, the number who have died from 9/11-related illnesses has increased from the toxic dust that was released," Shawn said. According to CDC data, 48,000 people have now reported 9/11-related cancers, with nearly 10,000 diagnoses in just the past year. More than 3,700 first responders have died since 9/11, including 2,300 who had cancer. "While 2,977 people were murdered here that day, the number who have died from 9/11 related illnesses has increased from the toxic dust that was released," Shawn said. For Shawn, the statistics are deeply personal, as he suffers from both respiratory issues and cancer directly related to the attacks. "I think of all those who were killed that day and those who continue to suffer because of that philosophy — that is not diminished. "If you were below Canal Street, basically, you were exposed to the dust," Shawn said. The health impact reaches far beyond first responders, Shawn said. "If you were below Canal Street, basically, you were exposed to the dust. I was here reporting on it. I think of all those who are suffering much greater … I've lost a few friends from this, of course." Shawn's own diagnosis came decades later, in the form of a bronchitis-related respiratory issue and then a cancer diagnosis just this year. Shawn emphasized the importance of coming together as a nation: "We're all in this together. We are all in it together." Khloe Quill is a lifestyle production assistant with Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and close ally of President Donald Trump, was shot dead at a Utah university event on Wednesday. The FBI released photos of what it's calling “a person of interest” in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah college campus Wednesday. A memorial for Charlie Kirk has been set up outside Turning Point headquarters in Phoenix. Scenes from inside a classroom at Utah Valley University, where some people rushed after a gunshot struck the conservative activist during an event on campus Thursday. Law enforcement officials say the sniper who assassinated Kirk has not been identified and is believed to have jumped off a roof and fled into a neighborhood after firing one shot.

Police barricades and tape is set up at Utah Valley University a day after Charlie Kirk was shot and killed, in Orem, Utah, Thursday, Sept. 11, 2025. The shooter, who fired a single shot from a distant roof, remained at large and unidentified on Thursday nearly 24 hours into the investigation.

(AP Photo/Jeffrey Phelps) The release of photos of a person in a hat, sunglasses and a long-sleeve black shirt, as well as a $100,000 reward for information leading to an arrest, reflected law enforcement's urgent appeal for public help in locating the shooter, who vanished after jumping off the roof and fleeing through a wooded area near the Utah university where Kirk was killed in a targeted attack. The Wednesday afternoon attack, carried out in a broad daylight as Kirk spoke about social issues at a Utah Valley University courtyard, was captured on grisly videos circulating on social media. Kirk can be seen reaching up with his right hand as blood gushes from the left side of his neck. Stunned spectators gasp and scream before people start running away. Trump, who was joined by Democrats in condemning the violence, said he would award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the U.S., while Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, were set to visit with Kirk's family in Salt Lake City. Vance posted a remembrance on X chronicling their friendship, dating back to initial messages in 2017, through Vance's Senate run and ultimately praying after hearing of the shooting. “So much of the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene,” Vance wrote. Kirk's casket was to be flown aboard Air Force Two from Utah to Arizona, where his his nonprofit political youth organization, Turning Point USA, is based. Ammon Paxton, a supporter of Charlie Kirk who witnessed the event as Kirk was shot and killed, visits a growing memorial outside Timpanogos Regional Hospital, Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2025, in Orem, Utah. An online petition calling for university administrators to bar Kirk from appearing received nearly 1,000 signatures. The university issued a statement last week citing First Amendment rights and affirming its “commitment to free speech, intellectual inquiry, and constructive dialogue.” Last week, Kirk posted on X images of news clips showing his visit was sparking controversy. Immediately before the shooting, he took questions from an audience member about gun violence. “Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?” the person asked. The questioner followed up: “Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?” Spencer Cox pledged would be held accountable in a state with the death penalty, wore dark clothing and fired from a building roof some distance away. Madison Lattin was watching a few dozen feet from Kirk's left when she heard the bullet hit him. “Blood is falling and dripping down, and you're just like so scared, not just for him but your own safety,” she said. She saw people drop to the ground in an eerie silence pierced immediately by cries. Some fell and were trampled in the stampede. When Lattin later learned that Kirk had died, she wept, she said, describing him as a role model who had showed her how to fight for the truth. About 3,000 people were in attendance, according to a statement from the Utah Department of Public Safety. The university police department had six officers working the event, along with Kirk's own security detail, authorities said. The shooting drew swift bipartisan condemnation as Democratic officials joined Trump and other Republican allies of Kirk in decrying the violence. “The murder of Charlie Kirk breaks my heart. My deepest sympathies are with his wife, two young children, and friends,” said Gabrielle Giffords, the former Democratic congresswoman who was wounded in a 2011 shooting in her Arizona district. The attacks include the assassination of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband at their house in June, the firebombing of a Colorado parade in June to demand Hamas release hostages and a fire set at the house of Pennsylvania's governor, who is Jewish, in April. The most notorious of these events is the shooting of Trump during a Pennsylvania campaign rally last year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EDITOR'S NOTE:  Help is available if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters. The Federal Trade Commission has launched an investigation into seven tech companies around potential harms their artificial intelligence chatbots could cause to children and teenagers. The inquiry focuses on AI chatbots that can serve as companions, which “effectively mimic human characteristics, emotions, and intentions, and generally are designed to communicate like a friend or confidant, which may prompt some users, especially children and teens, to trust and form relationships with chatbots,” the agency said in a statement Thursday. The FTC sent order letters to Google parent company Alphabet; Character.AI; Instagram and its parent company, Meta; OpenAI; Snap; and Elon Musk's xAI. The investigation comes amid rising concern around AI use by children and teens, following a string of lawsuits and reports accusing chatbots of being complicit in the suicide deaths, sexual exploitation and other harms to young people. That includes one lawsuit against OpenAI and two against Character.AI that remain ongoing even as the companies say they are continuing to build out additional features to protect users from harmful interactions with their bots. Broader concerns have also surfaced that even adult users are building unhealthy emotional attachments to AI chatbots, in part because the tools are often designed to be agreeable and supportive. Parental controls are coming to ChatGPT ‘within the next month,' OpenAI says At least one online safety advocacy group, Common Sense Media, has argued that AI “companion” apps pose unacceptable risks to children and should not be available to users under the age of 18. Two California state bills related to AI chatbot safety for minors, including one backed by Common Sense Media, are set to receive final votes this week and, if passed, will reach California Gov. The US Senate Judiciary Committee is also set to hold a hearing next week entitled “Examining the Harm of AI Chatbots.” “As AI technologies evolve, it is important to consider the effects chatbots can have on children, while also ensuring that the United States maintains its role as a global leader in this new and exciting industry,” FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said in the Thursday statement. “The study we're launching today will help us better understand how AI firms are developing their products and the steps they are taking to protect children.” In particular, the FTC's orders seek information about how the companies monetize user engagement, generate outputs in response to user inquiries, develop and approve AI characters, use or share personal information gained through user conversations and mitigate negative impacts to children, among other details. Google, Snap and xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “Our priority is making ChatGPT helpful and safe for everyone, and we know safety matters above all else when young people are involved. She added that OpenAI has safeguards such as notifications directing users to crisis helplines and plans to roll out parental controls for minor users. After the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine sued OpenAI last month alleging that ChatGPT encouraged their son's death by suicide, the company acknowledged its safeguards may be “less reliable” when users engage in long conversations with the chatbots and said it was working with experts to improve them. Meta declined to comment directly on the FTC inquiry. The company said it is currently limiting teens' access to only a select group of its AI characters, such as those that help with homework. “We look forward to collaborating with the FTC on this inquiry and providing insight on the consumer AI industry and the space's rapidly evolving technology,” Jerry Ruoti, Character.AI's head of trust and safety, said in a statement. He added that the company has invested in trust and safety resources such as a new under-18 experience on the platform, a parental insights tool and disclaimers reminding users that they are chatting with AI.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this photo released by Belarusian presidential press service, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, right, and U.S. Presidential envoy John Coale shake hands during their meeting in Minsk, Belarus, Thursday, Sept. 11, 2025. A Belavia plane of Belarus national carrier, lands at the International Airport outside Vilnius, Lithuania on Sunday, May 23, 2021. VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — Belarus freed 52 political prisoners on Thursday as part of a deal brokered by the United States, which lifted some sanctions on the country's national airline. Belarus has been repeatedly sanctioned by Western countries both for its crackdown on human rights and allowing Moscow to use its territory in the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. He has regularly released prisoners as a way to win favor, including freeing Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a key dissident and the husband of exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, in June. The concession from the U.S. came a day after Poland denounced an incursion of Russian drones into its territory — saying some came from Belarus — in what Western officials called an act of aggression. NATO jets were scrambled and shot some of the drones down. Trump, whose country is the major military power in NATO, offered an ambiguous initial response to the incursion, posting on his Truth Social platform: “What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones? Trump envoy John Coale announced the lifting of sanctions at a meeting with Lukashenko in Minsk on Thursday. Some sanctions on Belarus national carrier, Belavia, were relaxed in light of prisoner releases so far, according to a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic conversations. That will allow the airline to repair and buy parts for its planes, including Boeing aircraft. Once the plane landed, authorities arrested Raman Pratasevich, a dissident journalist who was on board. Lukashenko, who has relied on Russia's loans and cheap energy to keep Belarus' economy afloat, called the move “very important.” Tsikhanouskaya, Belarus' opposition leader in exile, warned that the easing of sanctions could allow Moscow, whose aviation industry has been sanctioned, to get airplane parts through Belavia. That could also create new opportunities for Belarus in its relationship with Russia. Minsk will be able to resell the parts to Moscow “at a very favorable price,” said independent analyst Valery Karbalevich, and it makes “the Kremlin's leash” on Belarus “a little longer.” One of the prisoners released Thursday, veteran opposition activist Mikalai Statkevich, refused to cross into Lithuania and tried to return to Belarus, but was blocked by the border guards, Anatol Lyabedzka, a key activist on Tsikhanouskaya's team, told AP in a phone interview from a Lithuanian border crossing where the prisoners were handed over. Lyabedzka said that Statkevich was standing in the no-man's land between Lithuania and Belarus. “Statkevich is showing courage and strength of character,” the activist said. “He decided not to let Lukashenko kick him out of the country and is resisting a forced deportation.” She became a symbol of Belarusian resistance after the authorities tried to deport her in September 2020. Driven to the Ukrainian border, she briefly broke away from security forces, tore up her passport, and walked back into Belarus. The other 51 freed prisoners have crossed into Lithuania, Lyabedzka said. Statkevich, one of Lukashenko's most prominent and charismatic opponents, attempted to run for president in 2010, but was arrested, convicted on charges of organizing mass riots and sentenced to six years. Amnesty International recognized him as a prisoner of conscience, and in 2015 he was released under pressure from the U.S. Statkevich was arrested again before the 2020 elections, found guilty once more of organizing mass riots, and sentenced to another 14 years. Franak Viachorka, Tsikhanouskaya's senior advisor, told AP that while most of the released Belarusians are in “normal physical and psychological condition,” some need urgent medical care. Elena Ramanauskienė — a Lithuanian who was detained in Belarus while visiting, convicted of espionage and sentenced to six years — burst into tears after stepping from the bus that brought her and some of the others back, and thanked those who made her release possible. “It's very cruel that I served my entire three-year sentence, and now I've been deported,” said Larysa Shchyrakova, a 52-year-old journalist who was almost done serving her 3 1/2-year prison term in her hometown of Gomel. Almost 1,200 political prisoners remain behind bars in Belarus, according to human rights group Viasna, and Trump has said he wants to win the release of more. Soon after hosting Putin for talks in Alaska last month, Trump hinted he was working on a deal to win the release of hundreds of prisoners held in Belarus after holding a “wonderful talk” with Lukashenko. Trump also added: “I look forward to meeting President Lukashenko in the future.” That would be a remarkable turnaround for a leader who has been widely shunned for his relentless repression of the opposition and independent media, especially after tens of thousands of people poured into the streets to protest his reelection in August 2020, in a vote widely seen as rigged. Prominent opposition figures either fled the country or were imprisoned.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The two leading Democrats in Congress appeared to agree in a private meeting Thursday morning that they could not support a so-called clean short-term government funding bill this month, ratcheting up the chances of a funding showdown with Republicans, according to three people briefed on the meeting. In the meeting, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his leadership team stressed emphatically to their Senate counterparts that their members could not support a “clean” short-term funding extension, those people said. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer appeared to agree, and Senate Democrats made clear that they understood they couldn't support just a “clean” bill, those people said. It's not yet clear whether this could trigger a shutdown after the September 30 deadline. The exact definition of “clean” stopgap is ambiguous on Capitol Hill, since GOP leaders have not formally put forward their own spending plan. Many Democrats on the Senate side are still eager to reach an agreement with their GOP counterparts that can avoid that painful funding lapse. And Democrats have been careful not to say publicly what they will seek from President Donald Trump and the GOP, since Democrats want Republicans to put forward an offer before outlining their own demands. Privately, top House Democrats say they want an extension of the Affordable Care Act subsidies expiring in December, among other demands. Schumer, too, has said he wants the GOP to extend those subsidies but has been cautious not to draw any red lines in public. “We're in a moment that is sickening and stomach turning, but also profoundly scary as a public official who goes to fairs, parades, every weekend in public,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal told CNN's Manu Raju on Thursday, adding that he's had to “really rethink” how he spends time in public in the interest of safety. Responding to President Donald Trump blaming rhetoric from the “radical left” for causing political violence, Blumenthal said, “Violence of all kinds is abhorrent, and the attempt to attribute it to one political view or another, I think, misses the point.” Asked about security concerns, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham responded, “I think we just need to be smart,” explaining that violent people “try to scare you into inaction.” “This is a very dangerous time, so it's not just enough to remember what happened on 9/11 and mourn our losses, it's to learn from what happened on 9/11, and I think we're forgetting the lessons of 9/11,” he added. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin called Kirk's death a tragedy, telling reporters, “Unfortunately, violence has become part of our political life that is so reprehensible but it's so common.” Nearly 3,000 people were killed in total, mostly in New York, after hijacked planes crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, as well as a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. “Savage monsters attacked the very symbols of our civilization. Trump told personal stories of some of the victims, including Brian Sweeney's voicemail to his wife Julie from aboard United Flight 175; flight attendant Renée May's call to her mother to say “I love you”; Tom McGinnis, who called his wife from the 92nd floor of the North Tower to describe what he was witnessing and tell her he loved her; and Chuck Costello, who ran into the World Trade Center to free people trapped in elevators. He also used a portion of his remarks at the Pentagon to pay tribute to conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was killed Wednesday. “Full heart, clear eyes — like those on 9/11, you will never be forgotten,” Hegseth said. “Like too many Americans, I was naive to the threats brewing abroad and infiltrating our shores, but from that day forward, I felt an unshakable call to action, a duty to defend our sacred homeland with everything I had,” he said. “Like all of you, 9/11 was the ultimate validator to serve.” “War must not become a mere tool for global social work, eager to risk American blood and treasure from utopian fever dreams,” he said. “We should hit hard, wreak vengeance and return home. For two decades, our warriors fought with valor, valor every day, far from home, even though sometimes their leaders gave them nation-building missions and half-baked exits. Thankfully, today we have an American military that President Trump has now rebuilt twice.” London — Peter Mandelson was fired as Britain's ambassador to the US on Thursday, after his ties to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein became another unwelcome problem for embattled Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Mandelson had been under mounting pressure over his relationship with Epstein after US lawmakers on Monday released a “birthday book,” compiled for Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003, in which Mandelson had penned a handwritten note describing Epstein as “my best pal.” Hours later, the scandal snowballed after Bloomberg published a trove of emails between Mandelson and Epstein, in which Mandelson expressed support for his friend and offered to discuss his infamous 2008 Florida case with his political contacts. Epstein pleaded guilty to two state prostitution charges and served 13 months in prison after a controversial plea deal. Keith Kellogg, President Donald Trump's envoy for Ukraine and Russia, has arrived in the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv, Ukrainian state media reported Thursday. The arrival comes after a striking escalation of Russia's conflict in Ukraine as more than a dozen Russian drones entered Polish airspace this week. Kellogg was enroute to Poland when the Russian drone incursion occurred, according to a source familiar with his travel. Amid growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump has said he's ready to apply new sanctions on Moscow, but hasn't detailed what measures he's considering. And, so far, he hasn't applied any new punishments beyond an additional trade penalty on India over its transactions with Russia. Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance will visit Salt Lake City, Utah, today to pay respects to the family of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, according to sources familiar with his plans. They will no longer travel to New York City for the anniversary of the 9/11 terror attack as previously announced. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, FBI Director Kash Patel, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will be in attendance, along with various New York and New Jersey officials. according to a statement from the 9/11 Memorial & Museum. Kirk was fatally shot yesterday at an event on a college campus in Utah. The vice president has called Kirk a “true friend.” The White House formally communicated to House Republican leaders that it wants Congress to pass a stopgap bill that funds the government through January 31, according to a person familiar with the request. That puts the White House budget office at odds with congressional spending leaders from both parties, who want a bill that funds the government through November, while keeping pressure on appropriators to pass full-year bills. Some appropriators in both parties have privately expressed fears the White House budget office is pushing for another full-year “continuing resolution,” which gives the administration more power and flexibility to alter Congress' funding plans.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge on Wednesday blocked Trump administration restrictions on services for immigrants in the country illegally, including the federal preschool program Head Start, health clinics and adult education. It puts the administration's reinterpretation of a Clinton-era federal policy on hold while the case is decided. Under the proposed changes, some community-level programs would be reclassified as federal public benefits, making them inaccessible to people without legal status. Individual public benefits, such as food stamps and college financial aid, have been largely unavailable to people in the country without legal status. US District Judge Mary McElroy, who was appointed by Trump in 2019, said in her order that the policy rollout was “rushed” in a way that would worsen the impact for people cut off from community services and those tasked with verifying eligibility. “The Government argues that it has somehow interpreted this statute incorrectly for the nearly thirty years that it has been the law,” McElroy wrote. “In its view, everyone … has misunderstood it from the start – at least until last month, when the right way to read it became clear to the Government. Messages seeking comment were left with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Education Department, the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice, which each were named as defendants. “With this victory, we are protecting children's education, safeguarding critical health care, and preserving the safety net that keeps families afloat,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said. Proponents of Head Start immediately voiced concern that the new policy would harm immigrant communities by taking away health services and educational opportunities. The federal government said it interprets Head Start as a federal public benefit, similar to welfare programs that exclude immigrants in the country illegally. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, whose agency oversees Head Start, said the directive would stop diverting “hardworking Americans' tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration.” In addition to preserving Head Start access, the lawsuit also sought to block the restrictions on other federal programs, including substance abuse services, mental health resources in schools, career and technical education, and job training opportunities.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Today, as people grieve for Charlie Kirk and express fears about what his death might portend for the future of American politics, his own words are bringing comfort and starting conversations. Politicians, pundits and free speech groups are emphasizing the point that a functioning democracy depends on resolving differences with words, not weapons. In the undated clip, Kirk talked with a woman who asked about his “Prove Me Wrong” events on college campuses. When people stop talking, “that's when civil war happens, because you start to think the other side is so evil and they lose their humanity.” On social media sites, people are also resharing a Kirk comment from last June about resisting the urge to overreact during stressful, scary times. “Turn off your phone, read scripture, spend time with friends, and remember internet fury is not real life. Also gaining traction on social media sites: One of Kirk's last X posts, where he commented on the Charlotte train stabbing and said, “America will never be the same,” as well as his final appearance on Mark Halperin's show, where he talked of America being a violent country. If you weren't a fan of Kirk, my humble advice is to absorb some of what his friends are posting and sharing today — like these X blog posts by JD Vance and Michael Knowles — to better understand where they're coming from. When he invited me to debate him a few years ago, he wrote, “I'm trying to be proactive about encouraging dialogue between people who disagree.” “Free speech is what we do instead of violence,” Perrino said. Veteran conservative organizer Matt Schlapp said on Newsmax and X that young people will “make Charlie awfully proud if you continued fighting. But also if you fought in a way where at the end of the day, you can go have a cup of coffee with someone who you disagree with, and show that there's a humanity to this important endeavor that we're involved in.” Stephen Colbert opened “The Late Show” on Wednesday night by saying, “Political violence only leads to more political violence, and I pray with all my heart that this is the aberrant action of a madman and not a sign of things to come.” At the same time, however, “in some corners of the MAGA ecosystem, heartbreak over Kirk's killing turned swiftly into rage,” Axios pointed out in a Thursday morning newsletter. According to Wired, some extremist groups are calling “for civil war and violent retribution.” News coverage is always a balancing act, of course, but I think it's important to lift up responsible voices in this moment, and not just linger on the provocateurs who loudly sow discord. Rhetoric professor Matthew Boedy, who has a book coming out later this month, “The Seven Mountains Mandate,” focusing on Kirk as the “new face of Christian nationalism,” said “we crossed a line in our nation yesterday and I can only think we will cross more.” Boedy's book is highly critical of the movement Kirk represented, so I asked if he fears blowback. He called President Trump's Wednesday night comments about the “radical” left “disturbing.” Meanwhile, many MAGA media leaders are pointing out the threats that they regularly receive, and multiple media organizations are reevaluating their security plans in the wake of this shooting. “I despair on behalf of my country,” conservative radio host and influencer Ben Shapiro said Wednesday. Shapiro said he had talked with Kirk about their shared security concerns in the past. “I do not know what this means for America, truly,” he said. “When political figures who just are out to discuss and debate in public are gunned down in cold blood, I do not know what we can expect next.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FBI officials recovered the bolt-action rifle used in the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk on Wednesday at a Utah Valley University event. “They have a virtual manhunt out there, so we'll see what happens,” President Donald Trump said Thursday morning after a event commemorating 9/11. Two suspects were arrested in the hours following the assassination, but both were released following questioning. As of writing, the killer has been at large for over 18 hours. Here's everything to know about the manhunt for Kirk's killer: At a Thursday press conference, authorities said they recovered the murder weapon: a high-powered, bolt-action rifle. The weapon was left in a wooded area, which has since been swept and secured. The FBI is working to get evidence from a palm, forearm, and foot print from the scene. Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason told reporters that authorities had a “good video” of the shooter. The suspect was described as being of college age and arrived on campus about half an hour before the murder. Officials are looking through doorbell and other security footage that may have caught the shooter. Mason said authorities had been several “breakthroughs” on Wednesday night. He said authorities were utilizing technology to track the shooter and were confident in their ability to do so. FBI Salt Lake City Special Agent in Charge Robert Bohls said authorities have received over 130 tips since the investigation began. Mason confirmed the description at a press conference, saying the suspect was wearing all dark clothing. The assassin is believed to have shot Kirk from a position on top of the Sorensen Student Center, several hundred feet away from him, and then made a hasty retreat. FBI Salt Lake City Special Agent in Charge Robert Bohls said the agency was providing tactical, operational, investigative, and intelligence support. He said the “only information” they have as of late Wednesday was taken from CCTV footage on campus. Authorities are combing through all footage related to the event. “They could be using cellphone data … cameras, you know. A lot of jurisdictions — and I don't know if the university had it — have license plate readers that capture license tags or surveillance cameras from public street lights and things like that around the time of the shooting or shortly thereafter,” Chris J. Quick, a retired FBI special agent with over 30 years of federal law enforcement experience, told the Washington Examiner. As for what investigators will be looking into, Quick said the gun used will give them a lot of information. The bullet itself will tell a lot about what type of weapon they're looking for,” he said. That's how cases like this are built,” he added. Despite the wide-ranging manhunt, there were no immediate reports of any major highway or airport closures. Security measures were limited to college campuses in Utah. Footage on social media showed him being handcuffed and taken away by police. Videos showed shocked bystanders jeering at the man as he was escorted. He was widely labeled as the shooter on social media. Shortly thereafter, Zinn was released and is no longer a suspect. Thank you to the local and state authorities in Utah for your partnership with @fbi,” Patel said in a post on X. He was quickly released after questioning by the police and is no longer a suspect. Patel announced an hour and a half later that the suspect had been released “after an interrogation by law enforcement. “Our investigation continues and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency,” he added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roy Cooper's record on criminal justice in the high-stakes North Carolina Senate race. Republicans, led by President Donald Trump, have called for the death penalty in the case and blamed lenient policies by Democrats and judges for Brown being free to kill. Central to that debate is Cooper's 2020 Task Force for Racial Equity in Criminal Justice, created after the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. While the Republican-led legislature never adopted many proposals, some elements have been implemented, including new law enforcement training standards and accreditation programs. Pointing to Brown's lengthy record and repeated releases, the National Republican Senatorial Committee launched a digital ad this week tying the killing directly to Cooper, accusing him of pursuing “soft-on-crime” policies as governor. Whatley, the Republican nominee, has kept up a steady drumbeat on social media. When Cooper later condemned the killing as “a horrible tragedy” and accused Republicans of exploiting it for political gain, Whatley shot back: “Law enforcement did their job and arrested this thug 14 times – YOU repeatedly FAILED to do yours.” Vice President JD Vance amplified the attack, writing on X that “weak politicians like you… kept letting him out of prison.” Cooper responded directly on X Wednesday: “If you're really concerned about the safety of North Carolinians, Mr. Vice President, you would reverse the federal cuts to local and state law enforcement that you and Michael Whatley championed so that our police have the tools to keep North Carolinians safe.” Budd pointed to the suspect's repeated releases from jail as a failure of leadership: “This guy had been released 14 times, and now she's dead.” He added, “This goes back to Roy Cooper and setting the tone for some very bad policies in our state. And the policies of Roy Cooper didn't lead to that.” Cooper's campaign stressed that the governor has a long record of prosecuting violent offenders, raising penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and keeping criminals behind bars. They described the Charlotte killing as a “despicable act of evil” and said Zarutska's family remains in their prayers. A North Carolina GOP operative noted that although many of the task force's proposals never became law, the recommendations, from eliminating cash bail to broad reforms critics describe as “coddling criminals,” now look far more significant in the glare of a statewide campaign. Doug Wilson, a North Carolina Democratic strategist, said the panel was created to improve coordination between police and the communities they serve, not to weaken public safety. “The title to a Republican strategist or Republican elected official may sound very progressive, but it was just trying to make sure that police and the communities that they serve were in sync,” he said. He predicted Republicans will continue to raise the stabbing as a campaign issue, and said Democrats must be ready. “Being tough on crime doesn't make you a bad Democrat,” Wilson said. Chris Cooper, a political science professor at Western Carolina University, said Whatley is likely to keep pressing the issue because it fits squarely into the GOP's broader crime message. “Because it's on video and because it's consistent with Republican rhetoric that cities have gotten out of control, I think he's certainly going to lean into this issue and try to lay blame at the feet of Roy Cooper and at the feet of cities controlled by Democrats,” he said. “I don't think most voters are going to make that kind of connection,” Cooper said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. That kind of journalism isn't easy. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Zeke Emanuel on RFK Jr. and the crisis of faith in public health. He's overseen mass layoffs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; canceled $500 million in federal funding for mRNA vaccine development; and promised to end the bias against “alternative medicine.” The country's leading scientists and physicians have started pushing back against the Trump administration's agenda, with some physician groups releasing their own Covid vaccine recommendations after Kennedy unilaterally changed the federal guidance this summer. “I think we all actually have a duty to try to improve the country no matter who's in power,” said Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and a medical ethicist who works at the University of Pennsylvania. Emanuel was a senior health care adviser in the Obama administration and informally counseled President Donald Trump's first administration on prescription drug prices and the early Covid-19 response. He said public health does need to be bipartisan — but Kennedy's agenda risks further dividing Americans. The health crises facing Americans are real, and we need real solutions — but Kennedy is not proposing them. Below is an excerpt of Emanuel's conversation with Today, Explained host Sean Rameswaram, edited for length and clarity. When you heard that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would be in charge of the US health department, what were your thoughts? I do not think he's qualified in any shape or form. He has been against vaccines, and that is very bad. Vaccines are probably the single biggest benefit to people in the 20th century in terms of total lives saved from 1974 to today. Those are huge achievements, and now, we're trying to roll them back. The thing about Kennedy that I actually supported is his emphasis on nutrition, his emphasis on chronic diseases, and trying to address them. That's not going to really save any lives. We need to address the whole food chain and nutrition subsidies that we have in this country — whether it's SNAP [food stamps] or the food subsidies to corn, soybeans, and wheat that help us get more cheap ultra-processed foods in the food system — and those haven't been addressed. If you really want to address chronic disease in America, that is a critical step. And yet, I don't see him really leaning into it. That's why we have to fire people at the CDC. But, in terms of high income countries, we aren't doing that well. Our health span is actually getting shorter, and that's been happening since roughly 1980.There are lots of hypotheses about that; I'll give you two that I think are really important. Richard Nixon's Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz really leaned into the production of industrial commodity crops — with heavy subsidies for corn, soybean, rice, wheat — that made the components of ultra-processed foods cheap. That combination — spending more to get cheaper components for ultra-processed foods and reducing the social safety net — are probably two of the biggest components of the obesity epidemic we've had, which has really fueled chronic diseases. I think if we really want to get a health care system, we have to focus on those two elements. Do you think there are areas for improvement at the CDC? Yes, I do think we can improve the CDC. But, let's be honest: If you're going to improve the CDC, the first place to start is not cutting its workforce, cutting its budget by billions of dollars. What do you think the effects are thus far of RFK's actions at the CDC and in public health more broadly? So, it will take a while to actually see the effects. But we're already seeing real harms in several ways. You're getting increasing vaccine skepticism in parents who are uncertain, who don't study the issue, who just are trying to go about their lives and can't really study these various issues. When you get fewer and fewer people vaccinated, you are going to get disease outbreaks — whether today, tomorrow, or in a long time, we can't exactly predict. Maybe we need to do them differently, but cutting is certainly not in the cards for all those chronic diseases. Cutting back the CDC's role is not better. My colleague, Dylan Scott, reported on RFK Jr. and the Trump administration burying a study about alcohol's links to cancer, and there's no clear explanation for why they'd not want this information to be in the hands of the public. Where do you think people, everyday Americans, should be turning to for health information if they feel like they can't trust the government anymore? Now, it's going to put more burden on people to get their information from a variety of sources. On vaccines, maybe my good friend Michael Osterholm's Vaccine Integrity Project, if you want to look it up online. In other areas like alcohol, you'll have to look at the old Surgeon General's report and try to get a copy of that. That reported on alcohol's problems, especially related to cancer, but not exclusively. Alcohol is a global issue, so there are a lot of global resources available, whether England or Australia or the Cochrane Collaborative. Spending a lot of time running around and looking for individual programs rather than being able to go to one site and readily access an objective answer is a major, major problem. I think that is part of the plan for this administration: make it very difficult to get this kind of information. Trump's war on immigrants could make your housing, food, and health care more expensive. Is a Nobel Prize grudge pushing India closer to China? Executives are preparing to slash their workforces. Now he's trying to take it away.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump suggested that his administration will target “radical-left” groups that funded violence toward Charlie Kirk and other conservative figures, including the president himself. Trump mourned Kirk, who was shot and killed on Wednesday at a Utah university, in an Oval Office address. I am filled with grief and anger at the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk on a college campus in Utah. Trump blamed those on the “radical Left” for inflammatory rhetoric that led to Kirk's shooting. There's no evidence to suggest that the shooter was affiliated with a Democratic group. FBI Director Kash Patel initially signaled a suspect was in custody, but later said a person of interest had been released and the shooter was still on the loose. “The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement. Our investigation continues and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency,” Patel wrote on X. Trump said the shooter was “attacking our whole country” by shooting Kirk. Today, because of this heinous act, Charlie's voice has become bigger and grander than ever before, and it's not even close,” he concluded.</p>
