                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brazil's supreme court has made Jair Bolsonaro the first former president in the country's history to be convicted for attempting a coup. The 70-year-old far-right leader claims he is the victim of political persecution, but three out of five judges concluded on Thursday that it was sufficiently proven that Bolsonaro and his close allies attempted to overturn the 2022 election, which he lost to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Seven other members of his administration were also convicted, including senior military officers – something also unprecedented in a country that endured a brutal two-decade military dictatorship (1964–85). After months of investigation, the federal police and the attorney general concluded that a “criminal organisation” led by Bolsonaro carried out a long list of different ways to keep the former paratrooper in power at all costs. The plot included a plan to assassinate Lula, his vice-president and Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who in 2022 was presiding over the electoral court. After the election, Lula and Moraes were closely monitored by special forces soldiers. The sentence is due to be announced on Friday. Bolsonaro has been under house arrest since 4 August, accused of trying to intimidate the supreme court's judges through a campaign led by his son Eduardo Bolsonaro in the US that resulted in tariffs and sanctions imposed by Donald Trump. Once the appeals are concluded, probably in October or November, the justices will decide where he will serve his sentence. Even before this week's conviction, Bolsonaro was already barred from forthcoming elections due to two previous rulings by the electoral court, one for attacking the voting system and another for using the presidency for electoral purposes. Brazil's largely conservative congress, however, may vote on an amnesty bill for him and hundreds of those convicted over the 8 January riot. Justices have already deemed the proposal unconstitutional, so if it passes, a judicial battle is expected. Trump has described the case as a “witch-hunt” against Bolsonaro and used it as one of the justifications for his 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports, but most Brazilian legal experts agree there was substantial evidence for conviction and that due process was observed. Moraes was also targeted with Magnitsky sanctions, generally reserved for perpetrators of severe human rights violations. In response, Brazil's government issued a statement that “condemns the use of economic sanctions or threats of force against our democracy” and “repudiates the attempt by anti-democratic forces to instrumentalise foreign governments to coerce national institutions”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bolsonaro has been charged with plotting a coup d'état, taking part in an armed criminal organization, attempting to abolish Brazil's democratic order by force, committing violent acts against state institutions and damaging protected public property during the storming of government buildings by his supporters on January 8, 2023. Part of the coup plot, prosecutors alleged, involved a plan to potentially use explosives, weapons of war or poison to assassinate leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, his Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversaw Bolsonaro's trial. Bolsonaro and other defendants in the trial have denied wrongdoing. The evidence against Bolsonaro largely centered on how he tried to stay in power after losing the presidential election in 2022 to Lula da Silva. Federal police said Bolsonaro had “full knowledge” of a plan to overturn the election results, pressure the military to intervene, and even create a parallel “crisis management office” to run the government. Prosecutors had alleged that the coup plot began in 2021, with efforts to undermine public trust in the electoral system. After Bolsonaro's defeat in the 2022 election, prosecutors said defendants attempted to overturn the results by encouraging Bolsonaro supporters to mobilize in Brasília, where they stormed and vandalized the three seats of government on January 8, 2023. Justices Flávio Dino and Cármen Lúcia also voted to convict, sealing Bolsonaro's fate with a simple majority of three judges. One more Supreme Court justice still needs to vote this week before the decision can be formally concluded. The guilty verdict means Bolsonaro, who is 70, could face decades in prison. Defense lawyers could still file appeals, but once those challenges are exhausted, the ruling becomes final and any prison terms can be enforced. Bolsonaro has long insisted that the trial amounted to a political witch hunt. That sentiment has been echoed by one of his biggest political allies, US President Donald Trump. His administration has also sanctioned Moraes for what it considers “serious human rights violations,” and announced visa restrictions against him and other court officials over Bolsonaro's trial. Bolsonaro's supporters and some on Brazil's right have welcomed Trump's interest in the case. Justice Luiz Fux on Wednesday voted to acquit the former president of all charges. He argued that the events do not constitute a coup as Lula da Silva was never overthrown. Bolsonaro joins a growing list of Latin American leaders to be convicted of a crime in recent years. Last month, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe was sentenced to 12 years of house arrest after being found guilty of procedural fraud and witness bribery – a verdict he is appealing. In 2022, Argentina's ex-leader Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was convicted of corruption related to public works contracts. And in 2017, Brazil's current President Lula da Silva was found guilty of corruption and money laundering, serving more than a year in prison before his conviction was later annulled. This is a developing story and will be updated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Deputy secretary of state says ‘foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors' Action will be taken against foreigners in the United States who are considered to be “praising, rationalizing, or making light of” Charlie Kirk's death, a top state department official has said. In a post on X on Thursday morning, the deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, wrote that “foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country” and said he had directed consular officials to “undertake appropriate action” against those deemed to be “praising, rationalizing, or making light of” Kirk's death on social media. A state department spokesperson said: “This administration does not believe that the United States should grant visas to persons whose presence in our country does not align with US national security interests.” Previously the Trump administration has directed investigators at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), who would typically target human traffickers and drug smugglers, to track down foreign students who may have shown sympathy for the Palestinian cause or criticized Israel in social media posts. The administration has gone after those who have taken part in pro-Palestinian demonstrations across university campuses. Investigators also now look for “anti-American” views, including on social media, when assessing the applications of people wanting to live in the United States, with diplomats instructed to look for “indications of hostility towards citizens, culture or founding principles of United States” in someone's online presence. Expanding such social media vetting to encompass commentary on an event such as Kirk's death would be a significant expansion of the administration's efforts to restrict dissenting views and opinions, particularly of “foreigners” in the US. Trump, along with other prominent conservatives and Republicans, have been quick to blame “radical left political violence” for Kirk's killing. Meanwhile, MSNBC fired its senior political analyst Matthew Dowd after he suggested on air that Kirk's own radical rhetoric may have contributed to the circumstances around his assassination.</p>

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! New economic data released on Thursday revealed fresh signs of stress for the US economy and working families. A new Consumer Price Index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) found that overall inflation rose by 2.9% year-over-year in August, while core inflation — a measure that excludes commodities such as food and energy — rose 3.1%, the highest reading recorded since this past January. Both of these numbers were in line with economists' consensus estimates, although they still showed inflation trending in the wrong direction during a time when the US labor market is also showing signs of weakness. Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. The report comes days after US President Donald Trump said in a radio interview, “We have no inflation. New York Times economics reporter Ben Casselman said that the spike in food prices was notable because it came after a long period in which food inflation had been coming down. “Grocery prices are once again rising relatively rapidly,” he observed in a social media post. Heather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, singled out some particularly important household staples in the report that she argued were very likely being impacted by President Donald Trump's tariffs. Among other things, Long said that coffee was now 21% more expensive than it was a year ago, while living room and dining room furniture saw a 10% year-over-year increase, and the price of toilet paper rose by an annualized 5%. “The middle-class squeeze from tariffs is here,” she said. It's troubling that so many basic necessities are rising in price again: Food, gas, clothing, and shelter all had big cost jumps in August.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In recent months, at least two people on the unit have attempted suicide and at least three have gone on hunger strike. If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. People in a New York prison's mental health unit are kept in their cells 24 hours a day, with the exception of an occasional “callout,” and denied therapeutic services, according to a lawsuit filed this week by Disability Rights New York and Prisoners' Legal Services of New York against New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS), among others. “Defendants are knowingly depriving individuals in the Residential Mental Health Unit (“RMHU”) at Marcy Correctional Facility (“Marcy”) of all out-of-cell programming and mental health and medical treatment and keeping them almost entirely isolated,” the lawsuit states. The unit was opened more than 15 years ago in response to a lawsuit filed by Disability Advocates, Inc., Prisoners' Legal Services, and others, which alleged that people with serious mental illness were kept in isolation and denied mental health services, the same conditions that allegedly exist today. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. State regulations mandate that people in the RMHU are offered seven hours of out-of-cell time each day — four hours of therapeutic programming and/or mental health treatment, and three hours for group programming, services, treatment, recreation and/or meals. There are currently about 95 people housed in Marcy's RMHU. They receive their meals through a slot in their steel cell door — the same opening that is used to handcuff them before they leave the cell. People in the unit are confined to their cells and recreation pens “all day, every day absent an emergency, outside visit, disciplinary hearing, or a brief medical encounter, such as for insulin injection,” the suit says. Counselors, therapists, and psychiatrists speak with the men through the cell's grate-covered window, which, for some people, is also covered with plexiglass. The pens, described in the suit as “an empty cage with a solid ceiling,” are often “filthy from both debris and human feces that are frequently thrown by incarcerated individuals from their recreation pens.” To receive medical or mental health care, people in the unit must “yell through the grate-covered window in their cell door.” Staff typically ignore their calls or are delayed in responding, the suit says. On August 6, a person yelled “SUICIDE” from their cell. Staff did not show up until two to five minutes later, and mental health staff arrived five to 10 minutes after that. Dejour Nesmith, one of the strikers, stopped his hunger strike because he was shown a piece of paper that said “force feed order.” Another plaintiff, Tyrell Escobar, reported that an officer assaulted him in August. Escobar has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), among other mental health disorders. The suit says Escobar's ring finger on his right hand “appears to be broken and his middle finger is bruised and crooked.” He did not receive X-rays until almost three weeks after the attack.

SOCHI, September 11. /TASS/. The United States realizes that instead of inciting Ukraine against Russia, it must focus on tackling the crisis' root causes, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.

"We particularly note that the United States realizes the necessity not to increasingly pit Ukraine against Russia, not to arm Ukraine in order to toss another batch of Ukrainian citizens into that crucible, but to work on removing the crisis' root causes," the top Russian diplomat said at a press conference following a meeting of the Russia-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) for Strategic Dialogue.

"It is precisely on this basis that we will foster dialogue both with the United States and with all our colleagues who are ready to assist in seeking a coordinated solution," the Russian foreign minister said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian drones shot down over Poland were reportedly headed for Rzeszow Airport, a key logistics hub for aid to Ukraine, German media outlets Spiegel and Welt reported on Sept. 11. Poland confirmed downing Russian drones in its airspace overnight on Sept. 10, marking the first time NATO engaged Moscow's military assets over its territory during the full-scale war in Ukraine. According to Spiegel, at least five drones targeted the airport near the Polish-Ukrainian border, where two German Patriot air defense systems are stationed. Dutch F-35 fighter jets were scrambled after an air raid alert and intercepted the drones, shooting down at least three. The remaining two crashed for unknown reasons, Welt reported. On the night of the large-scale attack, Russian drones not only entered Polish airspace but also violated Lithuanian airspace, according to Welt. There is no evidence that these drones accidentally flew over Polish territory in such large numbers on this route," Pistorius said, adding that this could be a deliberate operation. It is also a main stopover point for foreign leadership traveling to Kyiv on official visits. U.S. presidential envoy John Cole also announced that the U.S. is lifting sanctions from Belavia airline, Belarus's flag carrier. At least five drones targeted an airport near the Polish-Ukrainian border, according to Spiegel. "We will also discuss increasing pressure on Russia, sanctions, and the importance of lasting peace," Ukraine's Presidential Office Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said. Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, has arrived in Kyiv on an official visit, multiple Ukrainian news outlets reported on Sept. 11. "A large number of Russian drones entered Polish airspace — this is an empirical fact that does not require belief," Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said. "Last night, Poland's airspace was breached 19 times by drones manufactured in Russia. The assessment of Polish and NATO air forces is that they did not veer off course, but were deliberately targeted," Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said in a video statement. "We are dealing with a direct technological race in which the advantage will go to those who not only modernize but also stay ahead," Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than half of Ukrainian children under Russian occupation were subjected to indoctrination, while some reported torture and sexual violence, according to a report by Save Ukraine and War Child U.K. published on Sept. 11. The report, seen by the Kyiv Independent, found that 41% of children were subjected to militarization through weapons training, forced drills, or enrollment in state-sponsored groups such as Russia's Yunarmiya (Youth Army). The study also said that 18% of children were separated from their families, another 18% were denied medical care, and 17% reported being detained in police stations, filtration camps, or informal facilities. They wanted us to behave like their soldiers," a 16-year-old girl from Kherson Oblast said in her testimony. Researchers concluded that Russia aims to erase Ukrainian identity and prepare the children for eventual use in its armed forces, potentially forcing them to fight against their own country. "In each child's eyes, we see fear; in their voices we hear stories of being forced into military camps, punished for speaking Ukrainian or showing any trace of their heritage, and subjected to relentless psychological and physical abuse," said Mykola Kuleba, CEO of Save Ukraine. "Their very identities are being systematically erased in order to turn them into 'Russian children'." Helen Pattinson, CEO of War Child U.K., said that it is a "terrifying experience for a child to be separated from their families, let alone be stolen by another state." We're calling for immediate and impactful action from world leaders to return these children to their homes as the absolute bare minimum," Pattinson added. The abductions remain a central issue in Kyiv's talks with allies and Moscow. President Volodymyr Zelensky has called the children's return a non-negotiable condition in any peace deal. Ukraine's Children of War database has recorded 19,546 children abducted by Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion, with only 1,605 being brought back home. Researchers from Yale University estimate that the real figure could be up to 35,000. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Children's Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova over their role in the abductions. Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor. U.S. presidential envoy John Cole also announced that the U.S. is lifting sanctions from Belavia airline, Belarus's flag carrier. At least five drones targeted an airport near the Polish-Ukrainian border, according to Spiegel. "A large number of Russian drones entered Polish airspace — this is an empirical fact that does not require belief," Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said. "Last night, Poland's airspace was breached 19 times by drones manufactured in Russia. The assessment of Polish and NATO air forces is that they did not veer off course, but were deliberately targeted," Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said in a video statement. "We are dealing with a direct technological race in which the advantage will go to those who not only modernize but also stay ahead," Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said.</p>

MOSCOW, September 11. /TASS/. Forces from the Collective Security Treaty Organization's (CSTO) Rubezh-2025 drills are heading to Kyrgyzstan, Vladislav Shchegrikovich, spokesman for the CSTO Joint Staff, told TASS.

"Participants in the Rubezh-2025 command and staff exercise involving the Collective Rapid Deployment Forces of the Central Asian Region are regrouping to move to the Kyrgyz Republic. The troops of the CSTO (Collective Forces) from Kazakhstan, Russia and Tajikistan are on their way to the areas where the drills are planned to take place," he pointed out.

Shchegrikovich added that the Rubezh-2025 command and staff drills would be held at the Edelweiss training center and on Lake Issyk Kul, with the goal being to practice preparing for and conducting combat operations by the Collective Rapid Deployment Forces of the Central Asian Region aimed at eliminating illegal armed groups invading a CSTO member state.

According to the spokesman, CSTO Joint Staff Head Colonel General Andrey Serdyukov emphasized at a briefing ahead of the joint drills that the activity was a routine one and was not directed against third countries as its goal was to improve the coherence of command units and troops, as well as maintain the preparedness of forces to perform missions focused on ensuring collective security.

Shchegrikovich pointed out that the Collective Rapid Deployment Forces of the Central Asian Region, formed in 2021 based on a decision by the CSTO Collective Security Council, were made up of permanent readiness units and formations, equipped with state-of-the-art weapons and military hardware. "The main objectives of the Collective Rapid Deployment Forces of the Central Asian Region are to counter outside military threats and conduct joint counterterrorism operations," he stressed.</p>

In a stunning few minutes after markets opened, stock in Ellison's Oracle Corp. rocketed more than a third, enough for him to temporarily wrest the title from its longtime holder Elon Musk and hand it to the software giant's co-founder. But the stock market is fickle, and Musk was back on top by the end of the day, at least according to Bloomberg, as Oracle gave up a bit of its earlier gains. The dueling fortunes are so big each could fund the lifestyles of 5 million typical American families for a year, about the entire population of Florida, allowing them to all quit their jobs. Or they could just tell all of South Africa to take a vacation for year and produce nothing, based on its gross domestic product. Musk also controls several private companies, including rocket maker SpaceX, his artificial intelligence company xAI and the former Twitter, now called X. Ellison owns about 40% of Oracle, which means its surging stock added $100 billion to his net worth in little over a half-hour after the stock market opened. The night before after trading had closed the company announced in an earnings report that it had struck more than $300 billion worth of new deals, including contracts with the OpenAI, Meta, Nvidia and Musk's xAI. It said that it now expects revenue from its cloud infrastructure business to jump 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year. then rise to $144 billion in four years after that. Ellison said in an earnings call that Oracle would not just be making money from its computing centers that help build the next chatbots, but from the day-to-day running of those AI systems to run robots in factories, design drugs in laboratories, place bets in financial markets and automate legal and sales work at companies. In other words, Ellison's surge in wealth Wednesday morning reflected investor expectations that computers will take over many jobs now done by humans — and Oracle will benefit. Musk is hoping the same for Tesla and his own net worth, but he's been struggling to convince investors. The company had been promising a big turnaround in electric car sales after they fell sharply earlier this year, but the bounce back hasn't happened. Musk has been downplaying the bad numbers by trying to shift investors' focus to Tesla's other business of making robots and advances in the artificial intelligence behind its cars and robotaxis. Tesla sales in the European Union plunged 40% earlier this summer, the seventh month in row of drops, as customers balked at buying his cars after he took to X to support extreme right-wing politicians there. The company has been losing market share in the U.S., too, as buyers angry with his embrace of Donald Trump have stayed away from Tesla showrooms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Charlie Kirk leaned into his reputation as a deeply polarising figure, taking his conservative message to the most hostile places he could imagine: America's college campuses. This helped him build his Turning Point USA movement into a fundraising giant and catapulted him into the highest echelons of Trump world. Kirk exemplified the confrontational, populist conservatism that brought Mr Trump to power. He was turned down by West Point, the US military academy. And by the time he began attending Baylor University, a Christian school in Texas, he had already begun writing for the Right-wing website Breitbart and appearing on Fox News. To the horror of his parents, in 2012 he dropped out without completing his degree to start spreading the conservative word on campuses and Turning Point USA was born. “He was 18 going on 46,” Joe Walsh, an Illinois Tea Party congressman who was an early political mentor, told The New York Times. “And his mission, to go on college campuses and introduce the idea of free markets, was a slam dunk for getting money from old Republican farts.” The trickle of big donations turned into a tide of money after he appeared in front of wealthy donors in Palm Beach, where then Senator Jeff Sessions was in the audience with his young aide Stephen Miller, now a senior White House official. He publicly admitted that he was not sure about Mr Trump and described the convention as a “reckoning from the older generation” but went on to campaign for the Republican nominee, finding a place in Donald Trump Jr's team as scheduler and social media coordinator. “I love you brother,” said Don Jr after Kirk's death had been announced. “You gave so many people the courage to speak up and we will not ever be silenced.” He set up “Professor Watchlist,” designed to expose “radical” academics, and he delighted in confronting protesters who tried to derail his appearances. “We are not afraid to fight back against that, because enough is enough, and conservative students are under attack on college campuses, ideologically and unfortunately, sometimes physically,” he said during a 2017 appearance. “You need tremendous talent to do what he's done, building one of the most powerful youth organisations ever created,” said the president in 2019. At the same time, Kirk was careful to stick to his own lane, staying outside the administration and building up his campus operation, launching a podcast, and becoming a non-stop presence on social media. He married Erika Frantzve, a former Miss Arizona, in 2021 and the couple have two children. Kirk was among the tiny circle of Trump allies who hunkered down at Mar-a-Lago, Mr Trump's Florida estate, to build his administration and vet officials for posts. “There will never be another Charlie Kirk,” said Steven Cheung, White House communications director. “Charlie wasn't just a force of nature in politics, he was a dear friend who would drop everything if you needed him.”</p>
