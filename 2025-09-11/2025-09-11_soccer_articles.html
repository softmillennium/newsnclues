                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Twenty-one days ago, Alyssa Thompson scored a critical match-winner against the reigning National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) champions, the Orlando Pride, breaking an eight-match winless drought for Angel City FC. It would prove to be the last on-field action of this current chapter with her hometown club, but the story was far from over. Thompson's arm is still bound in a cast, but now she is wearing the colors of Chelsea Women's team after signing with the eight-time Women's Super League (WSL) title-holders last week. Though Thompson is still waiting for final eligibility approval on her cast, the PGMOL, which oversees referees in England, states that within WSL Football rules, “player safety is the primary consideration, with any protective equipment deemed dangerous.” Non-soft casts are judged for their safety by the match official, who has the final call. However, Chelsea head coach Sonia Bompastor said in a press conference last week that she is hopeful Thompson will be able to play on Sunday against Aston Villa. There was no real sense of mystery over her draft status, and yet Thompson took deep breaths as she awaited the sound of her name. As soon as NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman read it, she broke into a wide grin and brought her hands to her face. Thompson had foregone Stanford for this, and now her fate was all but sealed with Angel City as the team entered its second season in Los Angeles. It didn't take long for her sacrifices to pay off. But Thompson's departure from Angel City two years and eight months later was less pristine. There were lengthy discussions in a clandestine suite inside BMO Stadium, where Angel City plays, that continued across the continent and ocean to England, Thompson's Instagram Story post of a text message screenshot with the reminder not to “let someone rob your happiness,” and tears that fell during a farewell to teammates before the deal was done. It is another U.S. player now unavailable for promotion after a season without strikers Sophia Wilson and Mallory Swanson (both of whom are on maternity leave) and having only recently seen the return of Trinity Rodman. Still, Thompson blazed her path from Los Angeles to London over the past few weeks as determined as she is when she has the ball at her feet. Even as Chelsea navigated injuries to key players like centerback Kadeisha Buchanan, striker Sam Kerr, and centerback Naomi Girma, for whom the club had paid a then-record $1 million in transfer fees to bring over from the San Diego Wave in January, they still enjoyed an unbeaten season and a domestic treble last year. Not only are those players back this season, but Chelsea continued padding its roster with the likes of Australian fullback Ellie Carpenter from OL Lyonnes and Swiss goalkeeper Livia Peng from Werder Bremen. Still, compared to Arsenal's £1 million signing of 21-year-old Olivia Smith in July, Chelsea was quiet during the transfer window until the late push for Thompson. But adding Thompson, for just over $1 million, boosts an already winning squad. Thompson's versatility as a right-footed winger, who is comfortable playing down the left flank, appealed to Chelsea, but her profile is not a replacement for Lauren James or Mayra Ramirez, who are dealing with injuries. However, winger Guro Reiten's contract expires at the end of this season. Chelsea had been monitoring Thompson for some time, but it seemed unlikely she would move given she had just signed a three-year contract extension with Angel City in January. Initially, a January transfer for Thompson after the NWSL season concluded seemed more likely, especially since Angel City occupied ninth place in the table, just outside of playoff contention. The sisters have been somewhat of a package deal since Gisele signed with Angel City in December 2023, and they excelled at their Los Angeles club. Their rapid success led to Angel City extending both players' contracts in January. The sisters, born just 13 months apart, are extremely close and lived together in Los Angeles. Alyssa's move gives the sisters an opportunity to step into their own spotlights. When Thompson's camp realized Chelsea were serious about making a deal and willing to spend seven figures for the forward, talks sped up, according to sources. Thompson leaned on her family for support and even tapped her U.S. national team head coach Emma Hayes for guidance on Chelsea before making a final decision. “Emma always talks about her experiences at Chelsea in the national team, and just, like, how much she loved it,” Thompson said in an interview with the club. “But when I talked to Emma about coming here, she really wanted to make sure this was the right decision for me. She was asking me the right questions to really make me understand if I truly wanted to be here or not.” Since Thompson was not named in the USWNT's 2024 Concacaf W Gold Cup roster or the 2024 Summer Olympics, she has very little experience playing knockout stage football for club or country. The Guardian first reported Chelsea's interest in Thompson on Thursday, Aug. 28. By Monday, three days before the transfer deadline, Thompson's team was at BMO pushing to get the deal through, as Angel City played Bay FC at home. Time was already thinning, and the fact that the talks took place over Labor Day weekend further slowed negotiations, according to sources. Thompson was absent from the line-up on an excused absence. On Tuesday, Thompson shared a message on Instagram, a screenshot of a text advising the recipient not to “let someone rob your happiness.” However, she would soon be on her way to London, where she arrived Thursday morning around 10 a.m. Angel City did what it could to keep Alyssa, going as far as offering the highest salary the club could manage, according to a source, but it wasn't enough to sway her final decision. Before she finally left for London on Wednesday night, still waiting to finalize a deal, Thompson left each of her teammates a handwritten note saying goodbye. FaceTime calls stretched across time zones as those involved were up until midnight and 1 a.m. local times. Disputes over contractual language weren't resolved until 8 or 9 p.m., mere hours ahead of the 11 p.m. deadline. In the room were Chelsea's head of women's football, Paul Green, and head of player recruitment TJ O'Leary, Thompson's father, uncle and youth coach, as well as her agents and their commercial team. The Athletic reported an initial deal valued Thompson's transfer at just under $1.3 million, with other sources later saying the figure is closer to $1.45 million. If all of the contract's add-ons are met, depending on Thompson's and Chelsea's performances over the next five seasons, it will likely raise that total. The heavy investment by Chelsea with their five-year, fully-guaranteed contract is a statement of commitment that the club envisions Thompson as part of their long-term plan. As if scripted by the writers in her hometown of Hollywood, Thompson's Chelsea move means she is returning to the city where she first stepped into the spotlight as a 17-year-old making her national team debut. She was and remains the first teenager in USWNT history to make such a high-profile debut. “Since I started playing soccer, this is all I wanted to do,” Thompson, speaking to U.S. Soccer after the game, said. Like, it's kind of hitting me now that I just played.” (Top photo: Aaron M. Sprecher / Getty Images; design: Eamonn Dalton)</p>

Credit: AP/Abbie Parr Angel City forward Alyssa Thompson 's recent move to Chelsea spurred questions about whether the National Women's Soccer League is doing enough to keep its stars. More recently, Crystal Dunn, Emily Fox and Jenna Nighswonger have all moved overseas. Earlier this year, Chelsea paid a $1 million transfer fee to the San Diego Wave for U.S. national team defender Naomi Girma. Players who have left cite the adventure of living in a new culture and the challenges of a different playing style. Thompson's move hit a bit differently because she is still an emerging talent and was playing for her hometown team alongside her younger sister Gisele. But her departure has put a spotlight on the NWSL's salary cap, and whether it holds players back from their earning potential. Chelsea's record singing Alyssa Thompson, of the United States, waves to the fans before the Barclays Women's Super League soccer match between Chelsea and Manchester City, Friday, Sept. 5, 2025, at Stamford Bridge in London. The NWSL's salary cap is $3.3 million per team. The English Women's Super League, in contrast, has a soft cap, which allows clubs to spend up to 40% of revenues on player and coach salaries — but that number is based on the parent clubs, which means teams like Chelsea and Arsenal can count revenues from their men's teams. Angel City forward Christen Press and former national team player Tobin Heath called on the NWSL to ditch the salary cap during an episode of their podcast “The Re-CAP Show.” "Because I know that clubs in the NWSL, that are ambitious clubs, that want to be able to compete with the likes of Chelsea, with the likes of Barcelona — these teams are capped out. Heath said that even if teams wanted to sign a player to a big contract, that would mean less money for the rest of the roster, creating an imbalance that likely wouldn't be attractive for an athlete looking to improve by playing against similar talent. Ahead of the Champions League semifinal between Lyon and Arsenal in April, Heaps said she wanted a new challenge in moving to France, and theorized that's why others moved, too. “I think also the salary cap — there's a salary cap in the NWSL and I think that's an ongoing issue there that hopefully can be changed or increased. I think that's a factor in the NWSL and for players coming overseas," Heaps said during news conference before the semifinal. Women's World Cup winner Esther Gonzalez left Real Madrid to play for Gotham FC. German international Ann Katrin Berger also plays for Gotham and Italy's Sofia Cantore joined the Washington Spirit this summer. And there's no shortage of well-known players that — for now — call the NWSL home, including Gotham's Rose Lavelle, Orlando's Marta and the Spirit's Trinity Rodman. “It was like an option in my career to do this kind of experience, because I wanted to challenge myself in this league," Cantore said. Alex Morgan, one of the NWSL's original stars, who retired last year, believes the league still needs a salary cap. “Can you get every single thing right all the time? So I think the salary is something NWSL has to look at moving forward.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Nigeria national team is in danger of missing the World Cup, though the team can only blame itself for being in such a precarious position heading into the final stretch of the CAF qualifiers, where it's all or nothing. The Moment Nigeria Made a Critical Mistake The national team, one of the most powerful in the Confederation of African Football (CAF), didn't falter in their latest 1-1 draw against South Africa in Bloemfontein. Instead, their troubles began on the very first matchday of these qualifiers when they drew at home against Lesotho. This was compounded by a draw on neutral ground against Zimbabwe and a last-minute goal conceded at home against the same team. A loss to Benin, despite taking the lead, further complicated their campaign. There's a sense of disappointment among Nigeria's fans, as they can't afford to drop points against opponents where even a draw was already considered a loss. Nigeria Further Complicates Their World Cup Qualification Nigeria's hopes of qualifying for the FIFA World Cup 2026 took another hit after their 1-1 draw against South Africa. With just 11 points in eight matches, Nigeria has virtually no chance of reaching the continental playoff, even if they win their two remaining games.</p>

The U.S. Under-17 Men's National Team fell in two matches to the Netherlands U-18 side last week in Noordwijk, Netherlands.

On Sept. 5, the USA opened the scoring through Cavan Sullivan in the 11th minute, but the Oranje came back with two goals from Pharrel Nash (21st minute) and Ayoub Ouarghi (29th minute) to earn a 2-1 victory.

On Sept. 8, the USA received goals from Chase Adams in the 20th minute and Maxi Carrizo in the 49th, but fell 8-2 to the home side in the second preparation match.

The U-17 MNT will gather for one last domestic training camp during the October FIFA window before head coach Gonzalo Segares submits his final roster for the 2025 FIFA U-17 World Cup later that month.

The USA will face Burkina Faso (Nov. 5), Tajikistan (Nov. 8) and Czechia (Nov. 11) during Group I play in Qatar.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sept. 11 (UPI) -- Mexico is investing heavily in culture, infrastructure and technology as it prepares to host 13 matches of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, a tournament expected to draw more than 55.5 million visitors to the country. Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey will host matches, including the June 11 opening ceremony at Estadio Azteca, which is undergoing a $175 million renovation to increase capacity to 90,000 seats from 87,500. "We want every state to feel part of this global celebration," she said at the launch event at Punto México. "From the Pueblos Mágicos to archaeological sites and culinary traditions, the World Cup will be a window to all of Mexico."

Sept. 11 (UPI) -- Mexico is investing heavily in culture, infrastructure and technology as it prepares to host 13 matches of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, a tournament expected to draw more than 55.5 million visitors to the country. Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey will host matches, including the June 11 opening ceremony at Estadio Azteca, which is undergoing a $175 million renovation to increase capacity to 90,000 seats from 87,500.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>USMNT success against Japan may lead Mauricio Pochettino to adopt a different look for FIFA World Cup originally appeared on The Sporting News Nearly a decade had passed since the last time the head coach of the United States men's national team rolled into Columbus and rolled out a lineup featuring three players in central defense. Less than a week after that disastrous decision, Jurgen Klinsmann no longer was in charge of the USMNT. Mauricio Pochettino went ahead this week and did the same thing, anyway. As Pochettino and his side appeared in central Ohio for the second of two September friendlies, their circumstance was much different than faced Klinsmann and crew at the start of 2018 World Cup qualifying. For one, the current team actually had some experience with a three-man back line, having deployed such a look at the close of their 2-0 defeat against South Korea last weekend. And most important, the result of their game against Japan carried no consequence beyond public opinion. Because this tournament will be contested in the United States, Mexico and Canada, the USMNT do not have to qualify to compete. They just need to improve toward the possibility of excelling. “It worked fine; very clearly defined roles,” team captain Tim Ream, one of the three central defenders, told us late Tuesday at Lower.com Field. “We did not do much work on it, other than in game and talking about it during a few meetings. I think all of us felt really comfortable. “I said it the other night: It's another kind of wrinkle for us that we can use in game, in situations. We can start a game that way now. Though it might force Pochettino into fielding a lineup that does not feature his 11 best players, there are reasons it could be an ideal approach for this roster. “It simplifies things,” said midfielder Christian Roldan, a veteran of the 2022 World Cup. It starts with Ream, who will be 38 at the World Cup. No player has developed to displace him from his position, and thus he will become the oldest player (by more than two years) ever to start for the USMNT in this championship. It also allows him to move forward on occasion and to make greater use of his exceptional passing skill. That formation is more simple to understand for the players than the formation we started in against South Korea. MORE: Mauricio Pochettino boldly declares the process will work, for sure (Conveniently, that is Pulisic's jersey number with the USMNT). If summer star Malik Tillman had been in camp instead of remaining with Bayer Leverkusen in Germany to continue recovering from a minor injury, he likely would have started alongside Pulisic behind striker Folarin Balogun. “I think it's another good option, especially when you line up against teams with a back five,” Pulisic told The Sporting News. “It just matches up really well against them. Moving to three players in central defense and two wingbacks quite possibly will relegate 2022 starter Tim Weah to a substitute's role. That's why decisions such as this are not easy. It really has nothing to do with the failure of the experiment in November 2016, when Mexico visited what his now termed as “Historic Crew Stadium” in Columbus to open qualifying for Russia 2018. The USMNT had not used the three-man back line under Klinsmann at any point, and some players reported afterward they'd barely practiced it. How he arranges the players as the tournament begins will be an important element of how it all turns out.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thomas Tuchel is taking his first steps as head coach of the England national team, and so far, results have gone his way. Following the September international break, he shared a candid message ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2026 that could impact stars like Jude Bellingham and Trent Alexander-Arnold. Convincing wins over Andorra and Serbia put England within touching distance of securing qualification for the next World Cup. Other stars left out due to injury included Manchester City's Phil Foden and Chelsea's Cole Palmer. The situation was different for a few other top-tier players who were not selected by Tuchel, not due to injury, but for tactical reasons. Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jack Grealish were among those left out — both having recently made club changes. Asked whether he would be willing to leave major stars off the roster if necessary, Tuchel didn't hesitate. We nominated a squad of only 21 (outfield players) to keep the competition going.” FIFA World Cup 2026: Full list of the 18 teams qualified after September international window With the World Cup now just nine months away, Thomas Tuchel knows he doesn't have time to waste when shaping his squad. “The competition for places is on,” he said. Finally, the German coach made it clear that the potential absence of a star is a scenario he must always be ready for. Under Thomas Tuchel, England have found strong results. In the World Cup qualifiers, England have been flawless. They lead Group K with a perfect record, having won all five of their matches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KSHB 41 reporter Tod Palmer covers sports business and eastern Jackson County. The Coughlin family in Overland Park is pumped for the chance to see World Cup soccer a short drive from their home. “Definitely my son, for sure,” Jennifer Coughlin said Wednesday as the family visited Union Station. “He's our all-sports lover, but definitely soccer is his jam.” Ellis Coughlin and his sister, Kemper, don't have much of an opinion on the price point for World Cup tickets, but they would love to attend a match. Kansas City will host six World Cup games, including a quarterfinal, but the ticketing process is much different from what fans are used to for a Chiefs or Royals game — perhaps even downright confusing. When premium ticket packages went on sale in April, the prices were jarring — $1,225 to $3,000 per ticket, through OnLocation — for budget-conscious families. But those tickets are primarily geared toward corporate buyers and fans seeking a high-end, all-inclusive experience. “But at the same time, like everything else, there's a line where going to see Australia play Croatia — OK, that's cool, but it's not $8,000-a-ticket cool. I've heard all kinds of rumors that they're extraordinarily expensive.” Fortunately, for Cossette and the Coughlins, those rumors don't have much merit. FIFA announced Sept. 3 that tickets for the group stage would start at $60, which puts them in line with ticket prices for Sporting Kansas City's game against Lionel Messi and Inter Miami FC, an April 2024 game at Arrowhead that drew more than 70,000 fans. There were nine ticket-price levels for that game, but may be as few as four for World Cup matches, so prices may be slightly higher or lower than they were for Sporting KC-Inter Miami, which drew the largest crowd for a soccer game in Missouri history. “That's no more expensive than you're gonna pay to go to a Chiefs game, so I think that's reasonable, especially for a once-in-a-lifetime event,” Cossette said. “We're trying to get to a lot of games, a lot of different sports this season,” Jennifer Coughlin said. It doesn't matter to Ellis Coughlin; any World Cup game in his hometown would be a thrill. Soccer doesn't get better than the World Cup. Registration ends on Sept. 19, and fans selected by lottery will be notified beginning Sept. 29 ahead of the Oct. 1 presale. Tickets during that presale must be purchased with the Visa credit or debit card provided when signing up. That phase of ticket sales will be the first when buyers know what teams will be playing in the group-stage matches. Any remaining tickets will go on sale next spring, closer to the games being played. Tickets to all 104 games — including matches in Canada and Mexico, up to and including the World Cup final — will be available during the presales. However, fans can buy tickets to all matches at a venue, including Arrowhead, or for a particular team, including the U.S. Men's National Team. “As we expected, demand for tickets to the FIFA World Cup 26 is extraordinary,” FIFA said in a statement to KSHB 41 News. “We were experiencing initial extended wait times as the registration period opened.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is a sobering thought, but in previous World Cup qualification campaigns, Brazil would have needed to go through a playoff to secure their place in the tournament. With the expansion to 48 teams, they made it through relatively comfortably, but there's a lot of work ahead, and not much time in which to do it. Carlo Ancelotti only has friendlies in October, November and March before naming his squad. Getting the attack to click will be one of Ancelotti's priorities, and where he will be seeking to solve something that, surprisingly, has plagued Brazil in recent times: Who is going to play at center forward? - World Cup onside/offside: Good win for USMNT, Messi's last dance? - Gattuso's Italy now have a potent attack, but what's happened to their defending? - Can anyone stop Yamal and Spain marching to World Cup glory? Then, in the five World Cup-winning teams, they had Vavá, Tostão, Romario, and Ronaldo. But with more wingers than they know what to do with, producing strikers that like to play through the middle has proven something of a headache. But he had a very disappointing tournament, which seemed to rob him of his confidence as a goalscorer, and that, combined with a run of injuries, has cast him to the sidelines. Suddenly, though, the cupboard does not look so bare. Richarlison, Brazil's center forward in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, is once again a strong candidate, and he has two big advantages. He clearly endured a lot from being released to play both the Copa América and the Olympic tournament in 2021. It was a case of too much football, and it took its toll with a succession of minor injuries over the next few years. A different type of striker is João Pedro, whose profile in Brazil benefited enormously from that move to Chelsea during the FIFA Club World Cup. Richarlison is a vertical, front-to-goal striker, but João Pedro is much more proficient at dropping to combine, which came through in his performance last week against Chile. Matheus Cunha would have been there in the squad alongside them, eager for his audition, but he was forced out by injury. It also counted against him that he had never played professionally at home. Instead, he had bounced around from Switzerland, Germany, Spain and then on to England occasionally falling out with coaches as he went. His move to Manchester United could well be make or break. With his capacity to play up front or just behind the main striker, he could well find himself in direct competition with João Pedro. The lively Evanilson at Bournemouth is another possible candidate, but one who Ancelotti certainly has his eye on is recent Nottingham Forest signing Igor Jesus. In a game they had to win, they had a man sent off early, but Igor Jesus carried them over the line and produced a performance of similar quality when Botafogo beat Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup. There are some home-based candidates for Ancelotti to assess. Kaio Jorge of Cruzeiro made his debut off the bench last week against Chile and was then forced out of the Bolivia game by injury. An intelligent, nimble striker, he did not succeed in Italy with Juventus, but has picked up momentum since moving back. Much the same applies to Vitor Roque, a flop at Barcelona but starting to find his powerful feet at Palmeiras. And there is always Pedro of Flamengo, who went to the last World Cup. A firm favorite with the fans, Pedro is a superb finisher, although doubts remain about whether he is sufficiently quick and mobile for the modern game.

He looked like the boy wonder less than a year and a half ago when he scored the winner at Wembley and was on target a few days later away to Spain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. soccer federation have reportedly approached their French counterparts to raise the prospect of scheduling a friendly in March 2026 ahead of next summer's World Cup. As co-hosts together with Mexico and Canada, the U.S. men's national team (USMNT) will not play another competitive fixture until their first game of the World Cup group phase on June 12, 2026. There are still three international windows to navigate before next summer, with a glut of friendlies against Uruguay, Ecuador and Australia already in the diary for 2025. There has already been whispers of a clash against Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal and it now appears as though France are next on the list. This proposed arrangement would also see Didier Deschamps's side play one of Mexico or Canada in the same month. However, these grand plans can only take place if France have secured automatic qualification to the World Cup by then—should Les Bleus fail to finish top of their group, they could face a playoff in March. The 2022 World Cup finalists have made a winning start to their qualification campaign thanks in no small part to a pair of record-toppling goals from Kylian Mbappé. Few are more aware of the qualities boasted by France's captain than Pochettino, who coached the prolific forward at Paris Saint-Germain for 18 months. Mbappé rattled in 67 goals across 75 appearances under the Argentine at PSG between January 2021 and July 2022. Lionel Messi arrived that summer and helped Pochettino and co. re-establish their domestic dominance but PSG only made it to the Champions League last 16. Mbappé and the rest of his star forwards received criticism for their perceived inactivity when out of possession—a trait which is still causing debates at Real Madrid—but Pochettino was always quick to defend the Frenchman. “He can be there for five or even 10 minutes, not involved in the game, not involved with his team, and then just appear, do something amazing, and win you the match.” Grey Whitebloom is a writer, reporter and editor for Sports Illustrated FC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Generated by AI with support from our editorial team. If you're hoping to attend a match (or several) during next year's World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, now's your chance. Fans can already purchase 2026 World Cup hospitality packages, which include match tickets, on FIFA's site. However, buying tickets alone is a little more complicated. Because if you "win" the draw, you'll get a chance to buy tickets at a later date — though there's no guarantee tickets will be available during your assigned time slot. The day and time at which you enter the draw will not affect your chances of success, so don't worry about rushing to FIFA's site right away. According to the site, "In order to enter the draw, you must be the cardholder (primary or secondary) in good standing of a valid, unexpired Visa debit card, credit card, or reloadable prepaid card enabled with 3D Secure." Unfortunately, holding the right card is just the first of many hoops you must jump through to score tickets during this round. First, head to this page and click "Learn more" under "Tickets." You'll then be asked to fill in a captcha, after which you'll join a queue to enter the draw. While you're waiting — or before entering the draw — be sure to register for a FIFA ID here. Several TPGers have tried to enter, with mixed results. Some timed out while they were in the queue. I made it through the queue after about an hour and a half, then signed in with my FIFA ID only to find an error message. One lucky editor managed to actually enter the draw with her Visa card information. After the draw ends on Sept. 19, a randomized selection process will determine who gets a chance to buy tickets during the first phase. If successful, you'll be notified via email on or after Sept. 29, and you'll be given a date and time slot to purchase tickets starting Oct. 1. You'll also be able to purchase venue-specific and team-specific tickets (i.e., all matches for a specific venue or team). Since FIFA predicted high demand (accurately, based on our experience trying to enter the presale draw), they decided to release tickets in phases. If, for whatever reason, you can't secure tickets during the presale, you'll have an opportunity to get tickets during the later phases: FIFA also plans to launch an official 2026 World Cup resale platform later this year, potentially providing another avenue to get tickets. If FIFA's complex ticketing process and glitchy website seem to be sucking the joy from the beautiful game, don't despair. You have until Sept. 19 to enter the Visa Presale Draw (if you have an eligible card), and there will be more opportunities to score tickets in the coming months. The Points Guy believes that credit cards can transform lives, helping you leverage everyday spending for cash back or travel experiences that might otherwise be out of reach. That's why we publish a variety of editorial content and card comparisons: to help you find a great card to turn your goals into reality. When you choose to apply (and are approved) for a new credit card through our site, we may receive compensation from our partners, and this may impact how or where these products appear.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2026 FIFA World Cup hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico will be kicking off in just nine months. A few of those sides stamped their tickets during September's international break, marking another milestone en route to the soccer showcase. Ahead of FIFA's next world football ranking due on September 18, Bleacher Report has updated its own classification from March following the latest fixtures. The strength of recent opponents, tournament success, and qualifying-stage performances were factors taken into account to determine the order of our International Power Rankings for September. With Switzerland, South Korea, Senegal and Tunisia knocking on the B/R Power Rankings' door, Iran just about holds on in the top 20. That's perhaps not helping, with the Samurai Blue drawing to Mexico and losing to the United States in September. Before those results, though, things were looking pretty good for the AFC representatives, who had only lost once—to Australia—since February 2024. However, things turned sour when Japan faced higher-ranked teams, which is a bad omen as the World Cup approaches. Just when you think all hope is lost, the United States men's national team has a habit of reeling you back in. In September, a 2-0 loss to South Korea had head coach Mauricio Pochettino on the hot seat, only for him to turn the temperature down with a 2-0 victory over Japan. The Scandinavian nation top Group I with five wins from five, scoring 24 goals and conceding just three in the process. Ecuador falls a bit from its lofty position in the March rankings, which was earned after exceptional performances in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying. La Tricolor finished second in the federation's table after 18 games, ahead of notable teams such as Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay. While that is impressive, Ecuador had a disappointing run of four straight 0-0 draws from March 26 to September 5, although it broke that streak with a 1-0 victory over Argentina to close out the latest international period. Uruguay might be the most frustrating team in South America. After finishing third in the 2024 Copa America, La Celeste went on to win just one of seven games to close out the year. After a narrow loss to Argentina in March, they then drew 0-0 with Bolivia and followed that with a 2-0 loss to Paraguay in June. Wins against Venezuela (2-0) and Peru (3-0) seemed to suggest things were back on track, but then they chalked up a lackluster 0-0 draw against 57th-ranked Chile. But after sealing qualification with that win over Peru, perhaps Uruguay took its foot off the gas a little. It's just difficult to get a read on this team. On paper, the squad is strong enough to cause problems for opponents, but it just can't seem to muster any kind of consistency. Things aren't disastrous for Italy, but it might be getting worried about World Cup qualification with Norway's remarkable form. Italy scored 10 in two World Cup qualifying games in September, but questions need to be asked after shipping four goals (including two own goals) against Israel. The Red Devils smashed in six against Liechtenstein and did the same against Kazakhstan, keeping a clean sheet in both matches. Although they sit second in their qualifying group to North Macedonia, they have a game in hand over the Lynxes and should claim top spot when things get settled. Rudi Garcia deserves a huge amount of credit for turning things around quickly after the disastrous reign of Domenico Tedesco. Things were looking starting bleak for Croatia last year, but the team has come back to life in 2025. After an unfortunate Nations League quarter-final exit to France following a penalty shootout, Croatia has won its last four games with a total score of 17-1. Granted, the Vatreni didn't play a team ranked higher than 41st during that time, and they only squeaked past the 141st-ranked Faroe Islands 1-0, but that's still a decent record. The veterans are still turning up for Croatia. Key players such as Luka Modric, Ivan Perisic, Andrej Kramaric and Mateo Kovacic clock up an average age of 35, but they are proving essential. Draws against Peru and a 10-man Argentina in July weren't especially encouraging, and better form from other teams in the ranking hasn't helped Los Cafeteros' cause. A further slide was saved after their positive September results, beating Bolivia 3-0 and Venezuela 6-3. But with those teams ranked 78th and 46th, respectively, comfortable victories should have been expected. Most importantly, though, victory against Bolivia ensured their ticket for the 2026 World Cup. Mexico has a taste for trophies at the moment. While that's all well and good, El Tri will be a little concerned about results against teams outside of their federation. They lost 4-2 to Switzerland at home in June, and they only managed draws against Japan (0-0) and South Korea (2-2) in September. They'll need to step things up a level next summer if they want to make a big statement. With two games to spare, head coach Walid Regragui will be allowed to tinker in the remaining qualification fixtures and rest key players. While the quality of opponents isn't as strong for the Atlas Lions when compared to other continental qualification tournaments, they still have plenty of momentum. Morocco hasn't been beaten since January 2024 (aside from in the African Nations Championship, a tournament that first-team international players are not typically involved in). The Atlas Lions still have plenty of the stars who took them to the 2022 World Cup semifinal, and you can't rule out their chances of doing so again, with Achraf Hakimi, Bono, Brahim Diaz and Noussair Mazraoui making up a strong core of talent. A Nations League semifinal loss to Portugal is forgivable, as is a third-place play-off loss to France, but the 2-0 defeat to 52nd-ranked Slovakia in its first game of World Cup qualifying will have set off some alarm bells. After the 3-1 win against Northern Ireland, Die Nationalelf are only third in Group A after two games and they have made qualification for the world football showcase a little more difficult. Elsewhere, the Oranje's results don't look too bad in context. They have just three wins in six in 2025, but they have a draw and a penalty-shootout defeat to Spain, as well as a draw with Poland, among those results. They are top of Group G with a game in hand and should progress to the tournament proper without a lot of stress. Brazil's September international camp is tough to read into, given the wildly contrasting starting XIs involved in its 3-0 victory over Chile and 1-0 loss to Bolivia. New manager Carlo Ancelotti needs a little time to figure things out, and with an array of stars available and limited spaces to put them, some teething issues are expected. The Seleçao sealed their spot in the 2026 World Cup in June, so it's understandable if motivation was lacking, especially ahead of a tournament in which they will likely be considered among the favorites no matter what. It's still not clear what the preferred starting XI will be and how they will set up tactically, but there's plenty of time to get things right ahead of the action in the neighboring continent. It was difficult to muster enthusiasm for England under Thomas Tuchel's guidance, despite the Three Lions having lost just one of five in 2025 ahead of the meeting with Serbia. Conceding none should be more or less expected, but the woeful scoring return was cause for concern. But then England thrashed 32nd-ranked Serbia 5-0 with a performance that demonstrated plenty of positive signs in terms of squad formation and tactical framework. After functional but boring performances under Tuchel, that win against Serbia is perhaps a sign of things to come. Four wins from six in 2025 for France might not be as dominant as a squad of this caliber would hope for, but there is some nuance around the two losses that makes them less troubling. A 2-0 away defeat to Croatia in the Nations League quarter-finals first leg was quickly remedied with a 2-0 reverse at home in the second leg and an eventual win on penalties. Then, Les Bleus lost an instant international classic against Spain 5-4, coming back from 4-0 down after 55 minutes. Meanwhile, having likely Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembélé in the setup, alongside superstar Kylian Mbappé and one of Europe's most in-form players in Michael Olise, counts for a lot. The reigning UEFA Nations League champions climb here partly because of that silverware. Portugal has been handed a kind World Cup qualification draw, and it started the campaign with back-to-back wins over Armenia and Hungary away from home. "His strength, battling spirit and determination must always remain with us." Cristiano Ronaldo is still defying Father Time with crucial goals for his country, including in the Nations League final—he is also now the joint-top scoring player in World Cup qualifying history (39). With qualification for the 2026 World Cup already looking like a formality, the 40-year-old will be desperate to maintain that scoring form and play a big role in trying to pick up one of the few major titles he's not claimed. After all, it will surely be his final appearance on the world stage. Argentina just missed out on top spot in our March rankings, and it does so again this time around. However, with World Cup qualification sealed, the latter is of little concern. Spain's Nations League final defeat to Portugal gave the Argentinians an opening, but they weren't able to take it. It's perhaps too early to suggest Argentina will claim back-to-back World Cups, but it is in a positive position ahead of the 2026 tournament. While the game finished 2-2 after 120 minutes, a perfect set of penalties from the Seleçao meant La Furia Roja couldn't add to their trophy cabinet. But it doesn't mean a drop in ranking terms. There's no real cause for concern, with Spain having won four of its last six—if you include the penalty-shootout victory over the Netherlands in March—and not tasted defeat after 90 minutes since March 2024. It was also flawless in both of its September internationals—beating Bulgaria 3-0 and Turkey 6-0—and it tops World Cup qualification Group E. It should be a fairly serene path to the global showcase, allowing manager Luis de la Fuente the opportunity to test players and systems ahead of a tournament in which Spain will be hot favorites.</p>

The Visa Presale Draw is scheduled to run until 8 a.m. Friday, Sept. 19. Watch NBC Bay Area News free wherever you are World Cup organizers told them to be patient, it will take some time. Soccer fan Florian Ederer talked about his first attempt to score tickets. With matches in 16 cities, including at Santa Clara's Levi's Stadium, and fans expected from nearly every country on Earth, World Cup officials say it's a drawn-out process. "We know a lot of fans have been excited about this opportunity to start buying tickets … it's not all happening in one day," organizers said. Indeed, there are nine more days left in the presale entry window. After it closes, emails will go out on Sept. 29 about the selection process, giving people dates and times to buy tickets. World Cup ticket prices will range from $60 to nearly $7,000 per seat.</p>
