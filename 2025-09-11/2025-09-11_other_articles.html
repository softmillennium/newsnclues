                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(KY3) - Southwest Missouri Congressman Eric Burlison introduced new legislation regarding the investigation of UFOs or UAPs (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) in the United States. And this week, the Oversight Subcommittee held a hearing called Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection. UAP Disclosure Act of 2025, if passed it would be an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act government records related to UAPs. “For me, this is not a topic that was like a pet project of mine; being on the committee, it is a fascinating topic, I won't lie,” said Congressman Burlison. “I have been in politics for a little bit. I remain a skeptic; I don't believe there are little green men flying here from other solar systems or whatever. The goal is to keep records from being destroyed, create a UAP Records Collection at the National Archives, create an independent review board, and require disclosure of UAP records within 25 years unless a clear national security concern is addressed by the president. “What has been shown and proven is that we are spending a lot of money on this topic, and there is no oversight,” said Rep. Burlison. “And so, being on the oversight committee and specifically on the oversight committee that is investigating this topic and others is why I am kind of in the position that I am in. And I think if I am going to do my job right, I am going to do it like I do everything else, do it diligently and try to get to the bottom of things.” To report a correction or typo, please email digitalnews@ky3.com.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just days after The Conjuring: Last Rites scared up the biggest horror opening in movie history, the franchise is expanding into television with a major creative hire at HBO Max. According to Variety, Nancy Won has joined the long-awaited Conjuring series as writer, executive producer, and showrunner. She worked on projects such as Jessica Jones, Supernatural, and Little Fires Everywhere. With her genre experience and character-driven storytelling, she feels like a natural fit to carry the terrifying legacy of this franchise. The duo previously worked together on WandaVision and Agatha All Along. Cameron's other credits include Moon Knight and Werewolf By Night, while Squires has contributed to Gen V Season 2. This news arrives on the heels of a box office triumph. The Conjuring: Last Rites, which hit theaters on September 5, has already grossed $194 million worldwide. That number gives it the biggest opening for a horror movie ever, knocking 2017's IT out of the top spot, which held the record with $190 million. The film stars Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprising their roles as Ed and Lorraine Warren, diving into the chilling real-life Smurl haunting. There's still no release date for the Conjuring series, but with Won leading the charge and a powerhouse team of writers on board, the Warrens' haunted adventures are about to get creepier than ever on HBO Max.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But the Hollywood blockbuster was based on a haunting that took place here in Pennsylvania, and a Pennsylvania author has recently released a book on that very incident. Maxim Furek, an author of several books on paranormal events, released “The Smurl Haunting: When Ed and Lorraine Came to Town” in August. “I live in Luzerne County, a tiny little mountain community called Mocanaqua, and West Pittston was right up the road for me,” Furek said. The haunting led to a visit from famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren in 1986. “Ed and Lorraine Warren are known in the community, and they were sort of the ambassadors [for paranormal investigations],” Furek said. “I stayed in touch with Ed and Lorraine over the years,” he said. “I would ask Ed specifically how he did battle with these demonic forces. Furek and Rivera met in Gettysburg earlier this year. “I told him I was working on my Smurl haunting book, and he agreed to an interview on Monday, July the 14th,” Furek said. The timing was coincidental, though Furek noted in his field, there are those who say “there's no such thing as a coincidence.” Jack and Janet Smurl claimed that over the course of several years, they and their family suffered from things like unexplained loud noises and bad odors in their home, and that members of their family were shaken or assaulted by malevolent presences. And as recently as 2016, their daughter Carin Smurl said in an interview with the Pittston-Progress that the family didn't profit from the notoriety, and that “we wouldn't wish our experiences on anyone.” Furek's book documents their accounts, the Warren's findings, and the involvement of other investigators, including priests and other exorcists. “I think that these motion pictures are going to be a little bit dramatic and overblown, emphasized to a larger extent,” Furek said. Furek is a fan of the “Conjuring” series generally, and thinks that the scary movie and his book can pair together nicely. “If you want to be educated as to the right of exorcism and demonology, and how does the Smurl house compare with other haunted houses? Furek said that while he's written books on several supposed Pennsylvania paranormal events, he's particularly proud of this one “because it really does encapsulate the topic in a comprehensive way.” And as an investigator, he notes that when it comes to Pennsylvania, “there's something in the water” that seems to draw these stories in.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And I have a few traditions when it comes to the best month of the year: Watch a scary movie every day and go to at least one haunted house. So when I heard Carowinds was mixing my favorite things into a new, immersive attraction for its 25th anniversary of SCarowinds, I readied my heart for true terror. The attraction is a first on many fronts for Carowinds, particularly the collaboration with a major movie studio — in this case Warner Bros. — to use licensed material. “This is our first SCarowinds maze to be based off a blockbuster horror franchise, and it is the first ultra-immersive attraction that puts our guests into the storyline — making them live the horror, not just watch it,” Foshee said. “It is the biggest and boldest attraction we've ever debuted at SCarowinds.” Of course, I had to test this theory. I popped on my vans, put my hair up, donned a “Friday the 13th” shirt and headed to SCarowinds to experience the attraction first. Brief explainer: “The Conjuring” universe is about Ed and Lorraine Warren, real life paranormal investigators. And to get there, visitors will have to make their way through scare zones brimming with crawling monsters and roaring chainsaws. At the attraction, groups of about six to eight people will be thrust into a room where an old film camera starts to roll. The footage explains that we've found ourselves in the Warren's occult museum, and something strange is going on. From there, the group members become paranormal investigators. She will run away if you aren't paying attention. No, this isn't the real doll, which may be causing chaos on its U.S. tour. Each room elicited an expletive, at least from my potty-mouth. At one point, I was huddled with a cast member in a dark room and made to crawl to escape said man with the axe. And at the end, hold on because a demonic earthquake rumbles the archive room as we fight to put Annabelle back into her case. I'm giving “The Conjuring: Beyond Fear” two thumbs up. I went through the experience twice and was equally scared both times. Each experience was different, as cast members choose who holds what artifacts and what you have to do with each piece of memorabilia. I was stuck in a room alone my first go-around, but crawled through another room the second time. My advice: Really engage with the guides and your group. The guides will help visitors get through each room and remind you to keep track of the artifacts. I left Annabelle behind at one point on my crawl, but she was promptly, and maybe unwillingly, returned to me. The major difference this year is guests will have to purchase a “Haunted Attraction Pass” to visit the haunted mazes. Visitors can purchase a “Haunted Attraction Express Pass” for $49, which includes priority access to the mazes and one-time access to “The Conjuring” attraction. Some of the other mazes include Silver Scream Studios, which features throwbacks to past SCarowinds attractions and a maze with even more dolls.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republican Representative Eric Burlison played the never-before-seen video at a congressional hearing. Jeffery Nuccetell, who served as a military police officer for 16 years, reportedly claimed the footage was "exceptional evidence" of UFOs. Some accounts claimed the glowing, illuminated objects were spherical, while others recalled them being triangular. At least two witnesses who testified under oath alleged they were pressured by government officials to stay silent about their astonishing experiences. This isn't the first time Congress has heard testimony from whistleblowers and eyewitnesses about UFOs. For several years, Congress has held hearings on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena or UAPs, the government term for UFOs, in an attempt to gain transparency on top-secret government programs following years of speculation and scrutiny. An AARO report released in March 2024 concluded there was no evidence to support accusations claiming the government was hiding recovered alien spacecraft or technology, which further fueled cover-up conspiracy theories. Following the report, Rep. Robert Garcia pushed for more transparency, saying: "We know that there are objects or phenomena observed in our airspace and also possibly in our oceans. "The American people have legitimate questions, and I believe it's critical that Congress should help address them." As RadarOnline.com reported, then-Senator Marco Rubio stunned the country when he casually admitted UFOs "routinely" fly over U.S. airspace after an unknown object was shot down over the South Carolina coast in 2023. Recently released classified documents revealed a swarm of UFOs documented at an Ohio military base with ties to Roswell. The documents were declassified, as well as a video of two separate assaults by unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Greene County in December. One officer at the Ohio base reportedly said: "The objects appeared to be lights moving as a group, but too high up to get an accurate assessment of what they looked like."</p>

The CIA bankrolled Swann's brainwaves, hoping he could read enemy secrets using nothing but his mind. Welcome to Project Stargate: America's strangest Cold War weapon. He not only coined it but crafted a system so compelling, military intelligence took notes—and kept funding. Swann wasn't just a psychic; he painted his visions. His cosmic artworks, blending psychedelia and prophecy, now hang in the Smithsonian—otherworldly images pulled from the mind's eye, not a telescope. Born in Telluride, Colorado, Swann grew up amid mountains and mysticism. As a child, he reported out-of-body experiences and aura sightings—long before anyone handed him a clipboard or CIA badge. In his cult classic Penetration, Swann suggests extraterrestrials are watching—and perhaps walking among us. With government agents, UFOs, and telepathic battles, it reads like sci-fi. At Stanford Research Institute, Swann underwent controlled psychic experiments with physicists Hal Puthoff and Russell Targ. Results were so strange, even skeptics couldn't look away. NASA saw them with a billion-dollar probe. While critics scoffed, intelligence agencies quietly took notes—and kept the files classified for years.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This devotion is exemplified in the fandom's excitement for Misha Collins and Jared Padalecki to reunite with co-star Jensen Ackles on The Boys, though the season is not set to be released until 2026. Viewers of the series are so dedicated that they are interested in anything concerning the main cast members. In Season 1, Episode 8, "Bugs," Sam and Dean investigate the strange happenings of an Oklahoma housing development where bugs are killing people. However, they learn that the killer bees, spiders, and beetles are a result of a Native American curse. This early installment of the series is culturally insensitive towards Indigenous people by suggesting they are capable of dark magic, making it one of the most problematic Supernatural episodes. However, that's not the only reason viewers skip this bug-centric storyline. The depiction of bugs attacking and killing victims is stomach-turning, especially for those with an aversion to the tiny beings. At the beginning of Season 2, Episode 16, "Roadkill," the couple, Molly and David, are driving on a remote road at night when a man suddenly appears, causing them to crash. With David missing, Molly encounters the man she almost hit, who is a ghost, with a gruesome stomach wound and decaying face. In addition, it's one of the creepiest spirit episodes in Supernatural, featuring dark visuals and a violent villain. In Season 1, Episode 10, "Asylum," a couple of officers investigate a break-in at the abandoned Roosevelt Asylum, and one of them goes home to kill his wife, influenced by the evil spirits of the facility. Sam and Dean arrive to investigate the strange occurrences at the hospital, where a couple of college students have gone missing. It's unsettling when someone who is supposed to help people turns out to be the villain, and it's especially creepy when a dead doctor gets into the minds of the Winchesters, turning them on each other. For some fans, the most terrifying antagonists are mangled apparitions. This takes from and expands on the lore of the killer Hook Man urban legend, creating an eerie narrative in which an emboldened preacher justifies his violent actions with religion. "Hook Man" plays out like a classic slasher film with the twist of the antagonist being a ghost. The elevated horror elements of this installment make certain viewers avoid a rewatch. During this visit, Sam and Dean discover that changelings are in town, kidnapping children and feeding on vulnerable parents. This is an important Supernatural filler episode, mainly due to the introduction of Lisa and Ben, who have a more significant impact on Dean's storyline later on. Aside from this, the changelings are some of the most memorable creatures in the show, appearing as children but having terrifying true forms that can be seen in mirrors. Certain viewers are particularly unsettled by creepy children and won't watch these stories a second time. In Season 12, Episode 4, "American Nightmare," Sam and Dean investigate a case in which a couple of people die due to being whipped by an invisible assailant. The case brings them to a religious family living off the grid, who supposedly lost their daughter to an illness. However, it's revealed that the child was being held in the basement due to her psychic abilities being considered demonic, and she unintentionally hurt people trying to get help. Occasionally, Supernatural embraces the Scooby-Doo method, revealing that the true villain isn't a ghost or monster, but a human with evil intentions. In this case, the psychic child is an innocent victim, and her religious extremist parents are the villains. The concept of religion-fueled crimes is hard for many viewers, and some fans can't rewatch this eerie representation of extremist harm. Soon, they realize that there is a dark spirit in the home trying to harm the proprietor's daughter. This child spirit, who was a long-dead family member, was trying to get the little girl to die so she wouldn't be alone in the afterlife. This creepy kid representation is another example of viewers being disturbed by child antagonists. In this storyline, Sam and Dean, picking up one of their dad's cases, investigate several missing person cases in Colorado. Some viewers don't appreciate "Wendigo" because it misrepresents the folklore from Indigenous culture, but it's also one of the spookier installments. The backstory of the creature being a cannibalistic person unsettles some fans just enough to avoid this episode. In Season 1, Episode 19, "Provenance," Sam and Dean look into the strange deaths that seem to surround an old painting of the Merchant family from 1910. In a shocking turn of events, it's revealed that Merchant's adopted daughter, Melanie, was the evil spirit, and her father was trying to stop her. There are many terrifying monsters in Supernatural, but oftentimes humans prove to be the most horrifying villains. In Season 3, Episode 11, "Breakdown," Donna Hanscum, a sheriff the Winchesters previously worked with, asks for their help finding her missing niece. Helping out their friend, Sam and Dean discover an online website that sells human body parts to monsters. In their attempt to help Donna's niece and stop this business, they end up in a particularly dangerous situation. The villain in this story is former FBI agent Terrance Clegg, someone who learned about monsters and chose to use this information to create a profitable business. This offers an alternate perspective on the hunters who dedicate their lives to stopping monsters. "Breakdown" is an entertaining later episode, but another one that creeps viewers out with the concept of the dark web and human body part sales.

Mega Malamar is coming to Pokémon Legends: Z-A (Image: The Pokémon Company).

Pokémon Legends: Z-A is set to introduce multiple new Mega Evolutions to the Pokémon franchise, including Mega Dragonite and Mega Victreebel. In the past week however, official Pokémon social media accounts have become strangely obsessed with Malamar, a Dark/Psychic Pokémon from Pokémon X and Y. 

As it turns out, all of these shenanigans were due to another brand-new Mega Evolution: Mega Malamar, a Pokémon that has managed to hypnotise the entire world into Malamar-lovers.</p>
