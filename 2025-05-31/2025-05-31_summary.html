Slashed and paused funding, mass firings and information purges have destabilized crucial infrastructure for survivors.

Slashed and paused funding, mass firings and information purges have destabilized crucial infrastructure for survivors.

This story was originally published by The 19th.

Over the last four decades, the United States has built a web of federal policies and funding to address domestic and intimate partner violence, a pervasive health and safety crisis. 

In just 130 days, the Trump administration has put that safety net in jeopardy.

Funding pauses, cuts, firings and information purges have destabilized the infrastructure that helps victims of abuse. At the same time, federal teams dedicated to preventing sexual violence are being decimated. Departments in charge of administering grants that fund shelters for those fleeing assault have been deemed “duplicative, DEI or simply unnecessary.”

The first budget recommendation proposed by the administration of a man found liable for sexual abuse suggests eliminating the team tackling rape prevention and education. It takes a limited view of who is worthy of help to flee abuse. These changes limit how federal funds can be used to support survivors and emphasize criminal consequences for perpetrators over a more holistic view of justice.

The federal government has long recognized domestic violence and violence between romantic partners as a critical public health and safety issue. Four out of every 10 women say they've experienced violence at the hands of an intimate partner, according to a survey from the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Among men, a quarter reported being victims. Intimate partner violence can be deadly, particularly for women: More than half of all women homicide victims are killed by a current or former partner, according to a CDC study. 

In 1994, Congress recognized violence against women as a national crisis and passed a law that supercharged the government's funding and attention to the issue. They haven't solved the problem — but lawmakers and advocates say the Violence Against Women Act and its predecessor, the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, have been essential to the protection of victims and the decline in violent crime.

Federal grant programs are the lifeblood of domestic violence services programs — and they have been threatened since the day Trump returned to office.

His executive orders on gender and “illegal” diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility led to lists of banned words. Federal departments raced to sanitize their communications, eradicating decades of research and data.

Meanwhile, the Office of Management and Budget issued a short-lived freeze on funding distributions pending evaluation of programs for compliance with executive orders. Nonprofits that relied on federal funds to provide services to victims of domestic violence scrambled for legal advice: Was their budget at risk because they had a pride flag on their website? Did they also have to erase all mentions of banned words?

The National Domestic Violence Hotline, which is largely funded by appropriations from the Department of Health and Human Services, removed resources for LGBTQ+ survivors from its website. The majority of state domestic violence coalitions, the umbrella organizations that support direct service providers, took their websites offline — though when asked if it was related to Trump's actions, most declined to answer on the record. 

So far, there has only been one reported case of a grant from the Office on Violence Against Women being revoked, but hundreds of grants already issued by the Office of Justice Programs were abruptly canceled because they no longer aligned with the administration's priorities. Even while some of the cuts were reversed, the moves created uncertainty that makes it impossible for victims services organizations to plan, increasing the stresses of work that is already difficult and traumatic. 

Then it was not just current funding, but future provisions that came under fire. The Office on Violence Against Women removed all open notices of funding opportunities from its website on February 6. New versions weren't released for three months, disrupting the grant cycle that must conclude by September 30, the end of the government's financial year. Revised notices included major changes to department priorities and a longer list of activities ineligible for funding.

The U.S. attorney general has the authority to prioritize areas for grantmaking. Notices posted before Trump took office didn't have any; now applications are given bonus points in the review round if they “combat human trafficking and transnational crime, particularly crimes linked to illegal immigration and cartel operations” or seek to improve services in small towns, rural areas or tribal nations. 

The section defining what is ineligible for funding has ballooned. In addition to complying with executive orders on gender and DEI, the new restrictions put forth a more limited view of interventions around domestic violence. Activities that “frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses (e.g., prioritizing criminal justice reform or social justice theories over victim safety and offender accountability)” are banned, as well as activities that “discourage collaboration with law enforcement.” Initiatives that “prioritize illegal aliens over U.S. citizens” are also not allowed.

Rita Smith, an international expert on violence against women, is publicly raising the alarm about these changes. As the Office on Violence Against Women announces new grants on LinkedIn, Smith reshares them to her large network with a warning. 

“I think if people apply for these grants and they get them, it may open them up to the kind of scrutiny that they're not used to getting from the Department of Justice,” Smith said in an interview. She's worried that organizations will be subject to intrusive data collection or information gathering, especially around the immigration status of their clients. 

Smith used to work in direct services, and now has a more administrative role in the movement against domestic violence. “We never required anyone to show us their immigration papers,” she said. “We didn't ask for documentation if people said they were in danger. If they processed through the intake questions that we had, and we determined that they were in danger, we gave them shelter.”

“We didn't ask them for a green card. We didn't ask them for visas. We just brought them in to make them safe.”

The administration's priorities conflict with some recent moves to better reach diverse populations. The 2022 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act created a funding scheme for culturally specific service providers, which are tailored to the needs of Asian, Black, Native American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander or Latinx survivors. But how are those organizations supposed to operate when DEI is banned? How can nonprofits supporting LGBTQ+ survivors do their work without acknowledging the trans community? Guidance remains piecemeal and oftentimes unofficial — no one knows exactly how to bulletproof their organization. 

Smith sees the new restriction on funding as a way to redefine who is a victim in the eyes of the federal government. The requirements are so onerous that it can make it hard for nonprofits to serve their purpose: helping people escape violence.

Some organizations have made the decision to refuse federal funds because it comes with conditions antithetical to their mission. But the gaps left will be hard to fill.

When the Trump administration fired nearly every federal employee within the CDC's Division of Violence Prevention, it did away with the only team at the federal level working specifically on domestic and intimate partner violence prevention. 

The program they oversaw — called DELTA, or Domestic Violence Prevention Enhancements and Leadership Through Alliances — was first created in 2002 to harness federally funded research and expertise on the causes of intimate partner violence, along with the connections of state and local domestic violence groups, so fewer people become victims in the first place. 

Getting that work off the ground asked already strained groups trying to serve victims to shift some of their energy to prevention work, but staff at the CDC at the time, and until April, remained committed to what one laid-off worker referred to as the “cultural norms change” that's a key part of preventing domestic and intimate partner violence. 

Under DELTA, which currently funds 13 state-based domestic violence networks, the CDC helps state groups implement prevention programs and measures how successful they are at preventing violence. 

“If you remember taking a class on healthy relationships, or seeing PSA about domestic violence, or anything like that in your school or communities — those are some examples of our prevention work,” said one former federal worker within the Division of Violence Prevention who was part of the administration's “reduction in force.” They declined to be named out of fear of losing their remaining federal benefits.“People, I think, sometimes take it for granted, because it's just something that's there. But those kinds of things are going to go away, and no one is going to be there to teach our kids about healthy relationships or help communities reshape the norms around what's acceptable in how we treat one another.” 

“All of that stuff will be gone.” 

The administration has not clawed back funding for the current budget year from the 13 DELTA states, but staff in those states are doing without the expertise of staff at the CDC. The Trump administration has proposed slashing DELTA altogether next year, alongside the other programs under the Division of Violence Prevention, calling the spending “duplicative, DEI, or simply unnecessary.” 

The Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, which receives nearly half a million dollars in funding through DELTA, said the funding cut would be “catastrophic.” DELTA “is the only dedicated federal funding source for the primary prevention of domestic violence and a critical tool for driving real, lasting change,” said Jennifer Beittel, a spokesperson for the group. 

Hema Sarang-Sieminski, the executive director of Jane Doe Inc., the Massachusetts sexual assault and domestic violence coalition, said their CDC grant managers were all laid off. She found their advice and expertise invaluable; the team created resources for working with LGBTQ+ survivors and culturally specific communities. Jane Doe Inc.'s grant was for five years, and Sarang-Sieminski just reapplied, as required for year two. It's unclear what support her organization will have moving forward. 

Of the 61 million women nationwide who say they've experienced violence at the hands of a romantic partner, 16 million reported first experiencing it before they turned 18. The administration's staffing cuts and proposed budget cuts would also hit the CDC's team focused on teen dating violence. 

That team developed a program called “Dating Matters,” the first comprehensive teen dating violence prevention effort in the United States using funding appropriated by Congress. The funding came after several high-profile cases of dating violence, in particular the 2005 death of Rhode Island student Lindsay Ann Burke, whose boyfriend was convicted of her murder. Her parents became advocates for teen dating violence education efforts, arguing that their daughter may not have had enough information about the dynamics of abusive relationships before her death. 

One longitudinal study on 6th through 8th graders across four cities that adopted the CDC's Dating Matters model for middle school found that by the 11th grade, the program had no only reduced dating violence, but also sexual violence, harrassment, substance use and delinquency. In 2024, the team published a guide specifically for LGBTQ+ youth, who face higher rates of dating and sexual violence. 

In January, after Trump took office, those resources were deleted to comply with the executive order on “radical gender ideology.” By April, the whole team had been laid off. 

An update and rebrand of the Dating Matters program was slated to publish later this year, but it's unclear who will carry it to the finish line. 

“Dating Matters consumed a lot of my life and it was destroyed for no reason whatsoever,” said Sarah DeGue, senior scientist in the Division of Violence Prevention, who led the CDC's Dating Matters program for the last decade. “American teens are in the midst of a mental health crisis. … This is the absolute worst possible time to eliminate effective programs and resources that teach kids healthy relationship skills.”

DeGue was part of the administration's so-called “reduction in force.” Since leaving the CDC, she has started her own consulting firm focused on violence prevention and is uploading deleted resources to her firm's website. 

The former CDC employee who declined to make their name public said they hope lawmakers can intervene to protect the work. “I believe that there are still people in Congress, in our government at that level who care… But not the Trump administration. I don't believe that at all.” 

In his first term, Trump only floated cuts to the Office on Violence Against Women and didn't follow through. Now, groups are acutely aware of how many people will suffer — and die — without the funding that makes their services possible.

Two prominent lawsuits are challenging the constitutionality of these specific cuts. The American Bar Association won a preliminary injunction in a case alleging its five grants from the Office on Violence Against Women were canceled as retaliation for suing the administration. The $2 million of outstanding grants were to employ seven people to provide training to legal practitioners working with survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. 

FORGE, the only domestic violence services nonprofit dedicated solely to assisting transgender and nonbinary survivors, relies on the federal government for 90 percent of its operating budget. In February, it joined other LGBTQ+ organizations in suing the Trump administration over the constitutionality of the executive order about gender. In April, the Office of Justice Programs canceled FORGE's grants — over $500,000 in total —to produce a toolkit for providers working with trans victims of crime and a project addressing anti-trans hate . 

Arguments in FORGE's case were held on May 22 in a California district court. An order is expected soon. 

The federal funding freeze in January spooked Jane Doe Inc., Sarang-Sieminski said. Worried about conflicting with executive orders, the nonprofit took its website down. But after two days, it put the site back online. 

Reflecting on their core mission of racial equity is what changed the staff's minds, Sarang-Sieminski said. The site still has sections tailored to LGBTQ+ and immigrant survivors and speaks about building a more equitable world. “It's so through and through who we are that we felt like there's nothing that we really could possibly take down that would protect us in any meaningful way,” she said. Taking down the website would “only do further harm to communities who are counting on us to speak up and to be present and available when others refuse to.”

“What keeps me up at night is thinking about the stories we will tell about this time looking back,” Sarang-Sieminski said. “This is liberatory work, and what we want to see is a world where we can all thrive. And to me that means not leaving folks behind and standing up for our fundamental principles around this work.” Half of the organization's funding is dependent on federal grants, but she doesn't want that to “cloud our judgment around our values.”

On Thursday, Democratic Reps. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin and Debbie Dingell of Michigan, and Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, will join a coalition of intimate partner and sexual violence groups for a day of action on Capitol Hill to discuss the importance of federal funding. Both Moore and Dingell have led several letters to the administration pushing back on funding delays and staffing cuts.

“I am horrified,” said Moore, who has detailed her experience as a victim of domestic violence. “Maybe it's not intentional, but it's very dangerous as a survivor of domestic violence — a survivor in the days where there was no crisis line to call, … no information to be able to stand up for yourself. There was no shelter to go to.”

“We've made so much progress in the last decade,” Dingell said. “We're going backwards, and it really scares me.”

The Palestinian town of Umm al-Fahm is on the frontlines of the struggle against Israeli state terror and genocide.

As images of burned children, starving families, and bombed hospitals in Gaza become the constant soundtrack of daily life, the Palestinian communities that survived the Nakba and stayed in the lands that were occupied by Israel in 1948 (hence called “'48 Palestinians”), are filled with anger, frustration, and a sense of hollowness and disempowerment. Against the general paralysis, Umm al-Fahm, the main Palestinian city in “the Northern Triangle region,” stands out.

Palestinian activists in the town, united around the local “popular committee,” keep trying to break the barriers of repression and fear that have taken hold in their community since October 7. The last attempt was on Saturday, May 24.

The popular committee in Umm al-Fahm called for a national demonstration backed by the Higher Follow-Up Committee of the Arab Public — the united leadership of '48 Palestinian communities — alongside the Committee for Solidarity with the Administrative Detainee Raja Eghbarieh. 

The invitation for the demonstration came under three slogans: “We stand with our people! No to ethnic cleansing and genocide! Freedom to the teacher Raja and all other detainees!”

Even as the demonstration was licensed, the police did not let it end peacefully. As we gathered in Dawar al-‘Uyun, plainclothed “detectives” started to attack demonstrators and tear down some banners that they did not like. I noticed specifically that they objected to such banners as “No to Genocide” and “No to Ethnic Cleansing.”

This practice, where the police decide to censor the banners in a demonstration, is typical of the current blatant hostility of the police under the command of extreme right-wing National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. Even as the demonstrators do not initiate any confrontation, the local police want to prove their militancy to their higher command. They claim that some banners “might disturb public order” and attack the people who carry them.

When we wanted to start marching, the police blocked the road. There were some pushes and shoves, and people began circumventing the police. Finally, the police understood that it would not be simple to stop the demonstration, and “remembered” that our march was originally permitted.

One of the conditions of licensing demonstrations these days is that the Palestinian flag cannot be raised. As we were marching, the police noticed that some demonstrators were holding (not raising) the flags. They broke up the crowd violently and tore them from the hands of those holding them. In the chaos that ensued, they violently arrested a demonstrator.

It is no surprise that Umm al-Fahm is where '48 Palestinians most consistently try to organize protests against the genocide in Gaza. Descending from a long history of struggle, Umm al-Fahm is where Abnaa al-Balad, the radical left Palestinian movement, was born in 1969. The city has also been the center and unassailable fortress of the “Northern” Islamic Movement, which Israel outlawed in 2015. Naji al-Ali, the revolutionary Palestinian cartoonist, once wrote that “Umm al-Fahm is the nom de guerre of Palestine.”

In the early 2020s, ‘48 Palestinian communities were subjected to the terror of extortionist criminal gangs groomed by the Israeli internal intelligence service, the Shabak. The people of Umm al-Fahm responded with a rare example of popular mobilization against organized crime and societal violence in the community. New youth initiatives united with old political leaderships to organize mass demonstrations against the police's complicity with the criminal gangs. The same “Fahmawi” unified movement reached new peaks during what we call “Habbat al-Karameh,” or the “uprising of dignity” of May 2021, also called the “Unity Intifada.” The mass protest that started with the struggle against ethnic cleansing in Jerusalem's Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood quickly developed into a unified struggle across all of historic Palestine from the river to the sea.

The first demonstration of '48 Palestinians against the genocide in Gaza was held in Umm al-Fahm on October 19, 2023 — we tried the day before in Haifa, but were immediately repressed. The Umm al-Fahm police used this anti-war demonstration to frame two prominent leaders of the youth movement against criminality, Muhammad Taher Jabareen, and the attorney Ahmad Khalifah. They were arrested, tortured, and indicted for “incitement to terrorism.” Ahmad and Muhammad spent four and eight months in prison, respectively, and now remain under partial house arrest while they await sentencing.

Over the last year and a half, as Israel's war crimes continue to escalate, the Popular Committee of Umm al-Fahm continues to initiate street protests to try to pull the public out of the state of terror, hoping to turn despair into action. Most of these protests take place, almost weekly, in the central circle near the entrance to the city, in front of the new municipality building. Usually, there are dozens of participants from the city and the surrounding villages. 

We have a group of activists in Haifa that keeps trying to demonstrate against the genocide, but we are regularly attacked and dispersed by the police, so we have made a habit of joining the demonstrations in Umm al-Fahm. We meet there with activists from other regions within ‘48, all coming to encourage the most consistent effort at organizing anti-genocide activity by '48 Palestinians. Some of those who regularly join are radical activists from the Jewish society in Palestine, who are used to volunteering as “human shields” in the West Bank, trying to protect Palestinians against attacks by the occupying army and the settlers.

For more than half a year after October 7, it was totally impossible for Palestinians to receive a license for any kind of anti-war demonstration. As time passed, the Umm al-Fahm popular committee succeeded in getting one, and over the last year, the High Follow-Up Committee held several “national marches” in Umm al-Fahm, in which hundreds of demonstrators participated. 

Last January, the Follow-Up Committee wanted to organize a demonstration in Sakhnin, the center of the Galilee, but they could not get a license. 

After Israel broke the ceasefire with Gaza with ever more deadly attacks, the Popular Committee decided to move a step further, calling for the next anti-war demo to be held at the entrance of Umm al-Fahm near Route 65, connecting Tel Aviv with the Eastern Galilee. The street, also known as Wadi ‘Ara road, was shut down by Palestinian demonstrators on many important occasions in the past. While shutting down roads is not uncommon in demonstrations in Israel and is usually “contained” by the police, the possibility that Palestinians would engage in such actions is seen by the regime as a “security threat.”

On April 5, instead of the usual dozens who attend most anti-war demonstrations, hundreds gathered near the main road. The police were surprised, declaring that the gathering was illegal, but they did not have the force to disperse it. The main road was not blocked, but it resulted in a tense standoff. It felt like the spirit of struggle had returned to the streets.

After midnight on April 9, Israeli police and the Shabak forces stormed the house of Raja Eghbarieh, 63, the leader of Abnaa al-Balad in Umm al-Fahm, and the most prominent historical leader of that movement. After a week-long interrogation by the Shabak, and after they could not prove any offence, he was transferred to administrative detention — imprisonment without charge or trial.

At the beginning of the war, hundreds of '48 Palestinians were arrested. Most of them were charged with “incitement to terror” based on social media posts that were sympathetic to the people of Gaza. As “security prisoners,” they were thrown, together with thousands of their fellow prisoners from the West Bank, to the occupation's notorious dungeons. At the instruction of the extreme rightwing government and the anti-Palestinian public hysteria, these prisons became ruthless torture centers in a way that is historically unprecedented. While at the beginning of the war, there were many indictments and few administrative detentions in '48, the Shabak has recently expanded the usage of administrative detention.

For Palestinians from the West Bank, the number of administrative detainees went up from the hundreds to the thousands after October 7. We do not know the real numbers in ‘48 Palestine, as most of the detainees' families are terrorized into silence and fear that any publicity would invite retribution on their loved ones. Yet the number of known cases continues to increase by the dozen. 

The detention of Eghbarieh is considered a significant escalation for ‘48 Palestinians, as it is clearly aimed at the Palestinian political leadership. With his detention, the ghost of administrative detention finally had a name and a face that could be published. This helped to organize the struggle. The demonstrations that followed in Umm al-Fahm were not only against the genocide in Gaza, but also against administrative detention.

The next time that the popular committee called for a demonstration near the Wadi ‘Ara Road on the main entrance to Umm al-Fahm on May 10, the police decided not to let it happen. They threatened the organizers that if they pressed on with the demonstration, every single participant would be arrested. It was clear that this time the police would be there in great force, and the consequences could be severe. The organizers decided to cancel the demonstration at the last minute.

There was another inner circle demonstration on May 17, and then the latest national march on May 24. The confrontation at the May 24 demonstration, which marched as planned despite police provocations and a last-minute attempt to block it, was another step in the consistent efforts to break the silence that has prevented solidarity with Gaza.

Alongside the genocide in Gaza and the increasingly violent attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank, Israel has also intensified its policy of demolishing Arab houses, infrastructure, and commercial buildings inside the “Green Line”. Tens of thousands of homes, all over the country, are under demolition orders. In the Naqab, where there are hundreds of unrecognized Palestinian Bedouin “concentrations,” demolition of Palestinian homes is the main priority of the regime, as the police initiate high publicity campaigns to destroy whole villages.

The “war” atmosphere and the general terrorization of the population has impeded resistance to the demolitions. But on Thursday, May 29, there was an unprecedented general strike of the Palestinian population in the Naqab. On the morning of the general strike, thousands gathered in the regional capital of Bir al-Sabe' for a spirited demonstration in front of the government offices responsible for land confiscation and ethnic cleansing in the region.

On the same night, in the town of Arraba al-Batof at the center of the Galilee, hundreds responded to the call of the local popular committee and gathered to defend the home of one of the residents from a pending demolition. The house was saved, at least for now.

Finally, after a long political and legal struggle, a broad coalition of movements and NGOs, the Communist Party most prominent among them, received a license to march in Haifa against the war for the first time since October 7. The demonstration is set to take place today, May 31, and the organizers expect wide participation.

            Hamas on Saturday said that it has responded to a Gaza ceasefire plan put forward by the US, repeating its call for an end to the war, in a move the US' Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, called “totally unacceptable.”
    


            In a statement, Hamas said that its “proposal” to the mediators – Qatar and Egypt — “aims to achieve a permanent ceasefire, a comprehensive withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and ensure the flow of aid to our people and our families in the Gaza Strip.”
    


            “As part of this agreement, 10 living Israeli prisoners held by the resistance will be released, in addition to the return of 18 bodies, in exchange for an agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners,” the statement said.
    


            It comes after a senior Hamas official told CNN earlier this week that the group had sent back a three-pronged counterproposal requesting US assurances that the negotiations over a permanent ceasefire will continue and the fighting will not resume after the pause; that humanitarian assistance be carried out through the United Nations; and that the IDF pull back to the positions that they held on March 2.
    


            Witkoff said in a post on X Saturday that he received Hamas' response, calling it “totally unacceptable” and writing that it “only takes us backward.”
    


            “Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week,” Witkoff continued.
    


            An Israeli official told CNN on Saturday that they saw the militant group's latest response as having “effectively rejected the latest Witkoff proposal and put forward a new offer with its own conditions.”
    


            Later the same day, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office reiterated Witkoff's reaction to Hamas' response, saying in a statement: “While Israel has agreed to the updated Witkoff outline for the release of our hostages, Hamas continues to adhere to its refusal.”
    


            “Israel will continue its action for the return of our hostages and the defeat of Hamas,” the statement said.
    


            The US-backed and Israel-approved proposal seen by CNN on Friday includes Hamas releasing 10 Israeli hostages and 18 deceased hostages in exchange for 125 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and 1,111 Gazans detained since the war began.

Israel accepts new US proposal for ceasefire with Hamas, says Israeli official



            Negotiations toward a permanent ceasefire would begin immediately on the first day of the 60-day truce, according to the US proposal. The terms of the agreement would also allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza “immediately” and be distributed “through agreed upon channels,” including the United Nations and the Red Crescent, according to the proposal.
    


            But the draft agreement contained no intrinsic guarantee of a permanent end to the war, a key Hamas demand, nor assurances that the ceasefire will be extended as long as negotiations continue. Instead, it said that US President Donald Trump is “committed to working to ensure that good faith negotiations continue until a final agreement is reached.”
    


            Hamas had initially signaled reluctance to accept the terms of the deal. Bassem Naim, a member of the Hamas political bureau, said on Facebook Thursday that the framework did “not respond to any of our people's demands” but that discussions were underway, nonetheless.
    


            The back-and-forth between Israel and Hamas comes as famine conditions worsen in the Gaza Strip.
    


            Israel's 11-week blockade of humanitarian aid has left the enclave's population facing starvation. Though it was lifted last week, much of the little aid that has entered the strip since has been looted, and several people have been killed after chaos broke out near aid distribution sites, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
    


            Nearly 80 aid trucks traveling through southern and central Gaza were looted by desperate civilians on Saturday, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) said.
    


            In a statement issued on X, the WFP said 77 trucks had crossed into Gaza loaded with flour. All of them “were stopped along the way, with food taken mainly by hungry people trying to feed their families.”
    


            It added that “after 80 days of a total blockade, communities are starving – and they are no longer willing to let food pass them by.”

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will not approve COVID-19 vaccines for many Americans absent trial data showing that the benefits outweigh the risks, top agency officials said on May 20.

FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary and Dr. Vinay Prasad, head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said that the FDA's new COVID-19 vaccine framework will have two tiers. For people aged 65 or older, and for people who have a risk factor that places them at high risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes, manufacturers will only need to provide proof that a vaccine can trigger antibodies. For everyone else, or those without risk factors, the FDA is requiring data from randomized, controlled trials showing that a vaccine prevents symptomatic COVID-19 and secondary outcomes such as death.

Louisiana isn't just passing bad policy. It's laying bricks in a pathway toward fascism.

Louisiana isn't just passing bad policy. It's laying bricks in a pathway toward fascism — and elected officials are doing it in broad daylight.

This legislative session, lawmakers in Baton Rouge have been advancing a uniquely harsh combination of anti-immigrant bills. As someone who organizes at the intersections of immigrant justice, racial equity and decarceration, I need people to understand that what's happening here isn't about immigration. It's about control, surveillance and criminalizing compassion.

Consider Senate Bill 15, introduced by Republican State Sen. Jay Morris. This critical bill had a hearing in the House Administration of Criminal Justice Committee on May 28. If passed, it would amend state obstruction of justice and malfeasance in office laws to criminalize any public official or private individual who commits “any act intended to hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere with” federal immigration enforcement. That could mean refusing to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). That could mean advocating for a sanctuary city. That could mean doing your job with integrity — and getting charged with a felony. Public employees could face charges for refusing “lawful requests for cooperation” from agencies like ICE, Customs and Border Protection or U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The law would take effect August 1, 2025, if signed into law.

SB 15 mirrors “anti-sanctuary” laws in states like Florida and Texas that compel cooperation with ICE that the federal government often cannot constitutionally demand directly under the 10th Amendment's anti-commandeering doctrine.

Or take House Bill 554, sponsored by Republican State Rep. Dixon McMakin of Baton Rouge. This bill had a hearing in the Senate Transportation, Highways, and Public Works Committee on May 29, and its path forward is now more defined. This bill would mandate a specific, yet undefined, “restriction code” be placed on state IDs and driver's licenses issued to lawfully present noncitizens — people legally residing here like refugees, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients or visa holders, who are already ineligible for licenses if undocumented. It also requires the state mail these individuals an official notice warning them against attempting to vote, a felony offense. This marking might as well say: “second-class human.”

Functionally, HB 554's restriction code acts like the passbooks of apartheid South Africa or the badges forced upon marginalized groups throughout history. It is a state-mandated tool designed to mark, differentiate and control a specific population, making discrimination against them easier and reinforcing their “otherness.” This marking is distinct from federal REAL ID standards and targets the legally present, not for federal identification purposes, but purely based on noncitizen status.

And these are just two of several bills in a slate targeting immigrants this session. Other critical bills include:

In my role at the Louisiana Organization for Refugees and Immigrants (LORI), I've heard from families terrified to go to work or school. As political action chair for the NAACP in Baton Rouge and across the state, I see the same story play out over and over — criminalization of existence, wrapped in the language of “law and order.” LORI and other advocates have been actively opposing these measures.

Let me say this plainly: Immigration enforcement is a pillar of the carceral state. It is not broken; it is functioning exactly as designed. These bills weaponize that system further, deputizing local governments into the hands of federal repression. They turn teachers, social workers and public servants into potential enforcers under threat of state criminal charges like malfeasance if they refuse to comply. They target Black and Brown communities with surgical precision.

This is not about “border security.” Louisiana doesn't have a border with Mexico. This is about sending a message: If you're not white, not wealthy, not silent — you are expendable. These aren't isolated acts; they reflect a national playbook pushed by anti-immigrant groups seeking to implement a harsh agenda state by state, using places like Louisiana as testing grounds.

And harsh legislation is not the only thing that distinguishes Louisiana from other states on immigration: It's where ICE has incarcerated many university scholars and pro-Palestine organizers, including Mahmoud Khalil.

I write this not just as an organizer but as a survivor. I've known what it feels like to be discarded by the state, to be failed by every institution that was supposed to protect me. That's why I fight. That's why I speak. And that's why I will never comply with policies that ask us to betray each other to survive.

When the state seeks to criminalize broadly defined “interference” with federal enforcers while simultaneously marking the identity documents of legally present residents based on citizenship, it lays down bricks of control, surveillance and dehumanization — key elements of authoritarianism.

There is another way. One rooted in care, not cages; in sanctuary, not surveillance; in solidarity, not silence. But we won't get there by being polite. We get there by resisting. By organizing. By calling this what it is: state violence.

Louisiana is a testing ground. If these bills are enacted here, they will be copied across the country. But if we stop them here — if we rise up, call them out and demand something better — we can set a new precedent: that community is not a crime, dignity is not negotiable, and we will not comply.

From my vantage point, having recently attended the Kyiv International Cyber Resilience Forum (KICRF) and witnessing firsthand the unwavering determination in the face of relentless digital aggression, the situation unfolding in Ukraine's cyber domain demands our unvarnished attention.

The situation in Ukraine's cyber domain is not merely a theoretical exercise in network security; it directly impacts national sovereignty and societal resilience.

What I observed in Kyiv was a nation locked in a persistent cyber struggle, primarily against the Kremlin's digital legions — The Federal Security Service (FSB), Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) and the Russian criminal actors — now further complicated by a significant shift in the international support landscape. The U.S. government appears to be withdrawing from the cybersecurity battlefield as evidenced by its wholesale reduction in personnel within key government entities, including the Critical Infrastructure Security Agency, and directives from administration leadership not to have national resources focus on Russian cyber activities.

In addition to this, the unexpected closure of the USAID mission in Ukraine, leading to the reduction of support to Ukraine's ongoing cybersecurity efforts, casts a long shadow over Kyiv's digital defenses. This was further highlighted by the palpable concerns expressed during the KICRF and the embarrassing and inexplicable absence of U.S. government participation.

The Russian attacks on Ukraine are multifaceted, targeting critical infrastructure — power grids, telecom networks, the financial system — to inflict maximum disruption, all designed to erode public confidence.

One cannot forget that intelligence gathering remains a constant, insidious undertow. Add to that the weaponization of information and the relentless campaigns to pollute the information space, erode trust, and undermine Ukraine's narrative globally.

Then we have the repeated deployment of wiper malware — digital scorched earth tactics — underscoring the destructive intent. And while ransomware may have a profit motive, its impact on essential services amplifies the overall vulnerability.


Ukraine possesses a cadre of highly skilled cyber professionals, both within government agencies and the private sector, individuals who are actively engaged in the digital war.
    

However, amid this digital maelstrom, Ukraine demonstrates remarkable resilience and adaptability that demands significant attention and admiration. This is not a nation caught entirely off guard. Years of Russian aggression in the Donbas, the annexation of Crimea, and the 2015 attack on Ukraine's power grid all served as a training ground, forcing Kyiv to harden its digital defenses.

Crucially, the steady hand of international assistance — governments pooling resources through mechanisms like the Tallinn Accord, the strategic guidance of entities like the EU and NATO, and the often-unsung contributions of private sector cyber defenders — has provided a vital lifeline of expertise, technology, and funding.

And let me be clear, Ukraine possesses a cadre of highly skilled cyber professionals, both within government agencies and the private sector, individuals who are actively engaged in the digital war. Their agility, their ability to adapt to evolving threats in real-time, is a testament to their resolve. As we have seen, this adaptability and teamwork are foundational to their cyber resilience.

However, the cessation of USAID's programs, which included significant initiatives in cybersecurity for critical infrastructure and digital transformation — areas where sustained support is paramount — injects a new and unwelcome element of uncertainty. The loss of this funding stream will undoubtedly create gaps in Ukraine's ability to modernize its defenses, train its personnel, and implement crucial security measures. The growing dependence on other international partners intensifies, placing greater pressure on those who remain dedicated to upholding Ukraine's digital sovereignty.

This is where the global cyber ecosystem — both commercial and governmental, now operating with one less major player — faces a starker choice: stand by and watch the digital defenses fray or step into the breach with even greater resolve.

For Ukrainian tech companies, this is not just a crisis; it is an even more urgent imperative to innovate under pressure. The demand for tailored cybersecurity solutions — threat intelligence platforms with local context, rapid incident response capabilities, and secure communication channels designed for a hostile environment — is now amplified.

Investing in the next generation of cyber defenders through robust training and education programs is paramount. Strategic alliances with trusted international partners are no longer a luxury; they are a necessity for accelerated technology and knowledge transfer.

For international companies, the call to action is now imbued with a greater sense of urgency.

Providing Ukraine with access to the sharpest cyber tools — AI-driven threat detection, advanced endpoint protection, resilient cloud infrastructure — isn't just good PR; it is a strategic necessity to compensate for the receding U.S. presence.

Investing in Ukraine's tech sector, establishing a local footprint, or forging genuine partnerships contributes to long-term stability and fills a growing void. More is needed to offset the USAID withdrawal.

The timely sharing of actionable threat intelligence is a cornerstone of the collective digital defense, now even more critical with potentially reduced intelligence sharing through formal U.S. channels. Supporting and contributing to cybersecurity education initiatives helps build a sustainable talent pipeline, which is crucial in light of potential limitations in U.S.-funded programs. Engaging in meaningful public-private partnerships and leveraging the unique strengths of all stakeholders are the only ways to build truly resilient defenses in this evolving landscape.

Russia's cyber activity knows no geographic boundary. We must reject the notion that Russia's illegal war targets only Ukraine; Russia is at war with everyone.

This is not about charity; it is about safeguarding the integrity of the global digital commons in the face of a persistent and emboldened adversary whose digital reach extends far beyond the physical borders of Ukraine. The imperative — and the heightened responsibility – to act decisively is now upon us. The unexpected withdrawal of a major player, the United States, only amplifies the urgency for others to step forward and fill the digital breach, recognizing that the digital front line in Ukraine is a frontline for us all.

HIMEJI, Hyogo — A sister castle partnership has been established between Himeji Castle in Himeji, Hyogo Prefecture, and Schoenbrunn Palace in Vienna. Schoenbrunn Palace is now the fourth sister castle of Himeji Castle.

A ceremonial signing for the sister castle partnership was held at Himeji Castle with Himeji Mayor Hideyasu Kiyomoto and Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen in attendance on May 24. Van der Bellen's visit to Japan coincided with Austria's National Day event at the 2025 Osaka-Kansai Expo. Both parties agreed to proactively promote tourism exchanges between the city and Austria.

Schoenbrunn Palace is known for hosting the Congress of Vienna in 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.

Last spring, when Austrian government officials visited Himeji Castle, also a World Heritage Site, they proposed the idea of a partnership to Himeji officials. A basic agreement was signed in November.

“I'm confident that the partnership will help promote exchanges in a variety of fields and strengthen the ties between Japan and Austria,” Kiyomoto said.

Austrian President Van der Bellen expressed his hope to further strengthen the friendship between the two countries.

Jessica Moorhouse says young people may feel like saving is pointless amid rising costs and economic uncertainty, but there is always hope for the future.Supplied

Jessica Moorhouse is a money expert, financial counsellor and author of Everything but Money: The Hidden Barriers Between You and Financial Freedom.

Five years ago, when the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic, I started fielding a barrage of panicked comments, direct messages and e-mails from followers on social media. The inquiries came from people predominantly in their 20s and 30s, and all were asking me what they should do with their money. 

As a money expert who's the same age as her target demo, I was glad to be able to offer some guidance for the questions my peers were asking, however alarmist: Should they pull out all their investments and hoard cash in preparation for the end of days? Should they go all in on crypto because soon traditional currency would become completely worthless? Should they cancel their plans to buy a home in the city and buy land in a small town three hours away so they can finally breathe? What should they do?!

Five years later, I'm starting to get some very similar questions again, and my biggest concern is that Canadians, especially young Canadians, either haven't learned some key lessons from what happened – or worse, they don't care to, and are doomed to repeat the same mistakes. 

Wedding, home ownership, retirement: How to invest for three big life-stage expenses

Rob Carrick: A ‘how much should you worry' guide to stocks, mortgage rates, the dollar and more

For a little background, I'm not just a money expert; I'm also a millennial who is all too familiar with the feeling that the sky is falling. At this point, I'm honestly a bit numb to it. 

It started when my dad narrowly avoided financial ruin by choosing to stick with his stable 9-to-5 tech job instead of joining a startup in 2000. When the dot-com bubble burst, it swiftly swallowed that startup and hundreds more like it. Then, there's the financial crisis that has defined my adult life and those of my fellow millennials: The Great Recession. I graduated from university in 2009, and even though I'm now in my late 30s, it still haunts me. Then a decade later: COVID. And now this: a trade war with our closest ally, with no rules and no stable actor on the other side upon whom we can depend to act rationally.

Just when we've put out one fire, another ignites nearby. There's no safe haven to escape to, no place to relax our shoulders and exhale. It seems there's no hope at all for the future – just endless distractions on our phones that we can scroll through as we sip our expensive lattes, engulfed in flames while we tell ourselves, “This is fine.” Or at least, that is how many young Canadians feel, jumping from one global crisis to another while carrying the baggage of the ever-rising cost of postsecondary education, groceries, rent and real estate.

It's no wonder there is a general sense of malaise when it comes to saving and staying out of debt among Gen Z and the youngest of Gen Y. From their perspective, “Save? What for?” is a valid line of inquiry. 

And I get it. I really do. I felt a similar sense of despair in my 20s, feeling like no matter how much I saved or how “good” I was with my money, I would never catch up to where my parents were at my age – so what was the point in trying? And now with social media showing us videos of young people sipping champagne on yachts, sharing their outrageous shopping hauls or bragging about earning $50,000 a month by selling their course about how to earn $50,000 a month, comparison really is the thief of all joy.

But here's the thing: This feeling of disillusionment is not unique to Generations Y and Z. Almost every cohort of Canadians has had to deal with their own world-on-fire-type crisis. Generation X also entered the work force during a period of economic uncertainty in the 1990s; not only was this era followed by a long period of economic expansion, but we also got grunge music out of it. The Silent Generation lived through both the Great Depression and the Second World War, and I think we can all guess why they were so silent – they saw too much. Nevertheless, they too experienced a long period of economic expansion after the war, commonly referred to as the “Golden Age of Capitalism.” 

And being an elder millennial, I've also seen light after the darkness. The economic expansion that followed The Great Recession was the longest on record until the COVID crash in 2020.

You see, no matter how bad things are, they never stay that way forever. Despite this new period of uncertainty in our relationship with the U.S. and the return of recession talk, even if we're facing a rough couple of years ahead, I'm still hopeful for the future. History has shown us time and time again that what goes down will eventually go back up. Just take a look at the Canadian stock market. After every contraction follows a period of expansion that reaches an even higher peak than the previous one.

But more than that, we need to remind ourselves how resilient we can be in the face of adversity. Because if we Canadians are anything, it's resilient.

This is the underlying theme of my work and why I write about money for young people. No matter what kind of obstacles you face on your financial journey, I truly believe you can overcome them. It may not be easy or straightforward, and you may face more obstacles than others who have inherent privileges that you do not. But nothing is insurmountable as long as you can silence the internal noise, believe in yourself, learn the skills, and most importantly take a good look at your personal relationship with money.

For years as a financial counsellor, I would work with new clients and think that my only job was to help them with their money. That's why they came to me, after all: They wanted to get their finances together, craft a budget, get out of debt and start seeing their net worth go up instead of declining or stagnating. But with every single client, it was never just about the numbers. It was also about the role money played in their personal life and how their unregulated emotions influenced much of their financial behaviours and decision-making.

More often than not, money was a negative presence in their lives. Money always called the shots and made them believe that there was a ceiling to what they could achieve – that no amount of skill or effort could ever change that. 

These beliefs don't come from nowhere. They start in childhood, with that very first interaction with money, and they compound based on the lessons you learned about money growing up, the traumas you experienced or inherited from your ascendants, and, of course, just being a human with an out-of-date operating system incompatible with modern finance, as we all are.

So if you've developed a mindset from a young age that has you believing that the world is going down the toilet, that only the rich get richer, that you'll never be able to elevate your socioeconomic status, and you might as well spend your money freely as if the Earth is about to implode, then that will be your reality.

But what if you're wrong? What if the world isn't going to implode? It's not a bad idea to start saving and investing, while you've got ample time on your side, just in case the world continues to exist by the time you retire. And chances are, it will.

What if rich people aren't the only ones who can get richer? I actually know this to be true because I've seen it. Although it's a heck of a lot easier to build wealth when you already have it, I've worked with a number of clients who started out with a negative net worth, but after a few years of dedicated hard work, were able to achieve a six-figure net worth. It's possible!

What if you are capable of stepping into a higher financial position? For me, this is a rhetorical question, because I know that you absolutely are. You may not be able to see it now, especially if your income-to-expense ratio means there's nothing left after all the bills are paid – and especially if no one in your family has been able to do it before you. But what most people don't realize is that money is about more than just dollars and cents. It's about patience, perseverance, self-confidence and viewing things through a solutions-focused lens while keeping your emotions in check.

I graduated at the height of the Great Recession with a fairly useless film degree, hardly anything in my bank account and a student loan to pay off. After a year of trying to find a job while living in my parents' basement, things were not looking good for me. But one day, my older sister told me about a personal-finance blog she was reading and I decided to check it out. As soon as I started reading this blogger's musings about money in their 20s, I felt seen. I felt heard. I was no longer on an island alone. I then found hope amongst a whole community of people sharing their journeys, offering help and support and lifting each other up, no matter what their starting point was.

Hope is what's carried me through every financial crisis and setback ever since. And hope is what all Canadians, especially young Canadians, need to hold onto to get us through this next roller-coaster ride. Because without hope, what's the alternative?

            When Adefemola Akintade learned that the Trump administration had suspended the processing of foreign student visas, she immediately went blank. “I don't know what to do; this is something I've always wanted for the longest of times,” she told CNN, still with an air of disbelief.
    


            The Nigerian journalist has been accepted into Columbia Journalism School for a master's degree and was on the cusp of applying for her US visa. “I don't have any backup plan,” the 31-year-old said. “I put all my eggs in one basket – in Columbia… which is quite a risk.” She is due to start her degree in New York in August having already paid a hefty enrolment fee.
    


            Akintade is among thousands of people across the globe who were thrown into limbo on Tuesday when the US State Department instructed its embassies and consulates to pause the scheduling of new student visa interviews as it plans to expand social media vetting for applicants.
    


            It's the latest in a series of moves by the Trump White House targeting higher education, starting with an ongoing fight with Harvard University and then dramatically expanding in scope.
    


            CNN spoke with several affected overseas students, who expressed a mix of sadness, confusion and fear over the latest developments and the sudden upending of their lives. Many of them asked to remain anonymous, citing concerns about possible retribution or problems in the future.
    


            “It feels like a really scary and unsettling time for international students studying in the US,” said one Canadian student who has also been accepted by Columbia. “A lot of us chose to study in the US for its freedoms but now knowing that innocent social media posts could cost an education feels like censorship.”
    


            Some prospective students have even started self-censoring. Another Canadian, accepted into Harvard Law School, told CNN how a friend working on Capitol Hill advised her to go through her social media posts shortly after the visa suspension news broke.
    


            “We were looking at a post from us at Pride, and my caption was simply a rainbow flag and then a trans flag. And I was on the phone with her ‘and I was like, do I have to take this down?' Eventually we decided no, I could leave it up, but I changed the caption, I removed the trans flag. I don't know how to feel about that,” the student said.
    


            “I do think it's real proof that it is a fear campaign that is incredibly successful,” she said, adding that she has deferred her place for this year after getting a job offer. “I changed the caption with the anticipation that it could get worse. Today it is one (issue) and tomorrow it will be another one.”
    


            The State Department has required visa applicants to provide social media identifiers on immigrant and nonimmigrant visa application forms since 2019, a spokesperson said. In addition, it had already called for extra social media vetting of some applicants, largely related to alleged antisemitism. But it's unclear what kind of post might pose a problem for an application from now on, or how these posts will be scrutinized.
    


            British student Conrad Kunadu said he'd been grappling with an “internal conflict” over his offer to pursue a PhD in Environmental Health at Johns Hopkins University after monitoring the crackdown on US colleges “religiously” for the past few months.
    


            The case of a French scientist who was recently denied entry into the US for allegedly posting messages criticizing President Donald Trump was a “big turning point” for Kunadu. “I was like, oh, wow. Ok, no, this is potentially really bad. I just don't know if this is an environment that I actually want to be in,” he told CNN.
    


            After wondering whether he could manage his anxiety that “something (he) wrote in 2016” could get him deported, Kunadu decided to stay in Britain and study at Oxford University instead. Despite being grateful to have another option, he described his situation as a “lose-lose.”
    


            “I wanted to study in the US not just because, for my interests in health security, it's where all the talent and resources are, but because it's the best way to make an impact on these issues at a global scale,” Kunadu said. Like many others, he can't help but mourn the possible academic research and advances that now may never come to fruition.

            Kunadu and another student who requested anonymity both mentioned being anxious about exploring topics in their studies that could be interpreted as dissent and ruffle official feathers.
    


            “It's incredibly distressing as an American to hear that,” Michael Kagan, who directs the Immigration Clinic at the University of Nevada, told CNN. “It's not something someone should have to worry about to study in the United States… But I think, right now, it's totally rational. And if I were advising someone, I would tell them that, from a legal point of view, that seems like a reasonable thing to be concerned about.”
    


            Kagan described the visa halt as “one of many attacks on higher education and immigrants… two of the Trump administration's favorite targets,” which in this case overlap. And while the directive is consistent with what the White House was already doing, he sees this as “an unprecedented attack in a non-emergency time.”
    


            When asked whether those who had accepted college offers and were waiting for a visa appointment had any legal avenues available to them, Kagan was not encouraging. “If someone is trying to enter and not yet getting a visa, (that person) usually has nearly no recourse,” he said.
    


            In the 2023-34 academic year, more than 1.1 million international students studied at US higher education institutions, according to a report from the the Institute of International Education.
    


            The students CNN spoke with were all now trying to come to terms with their new reality and figure out their next steps. “I'm still kind of hoping that there's a Supreme Court case that suddenly sees things in my favor,” Kunadu said.
    


            Oliver Cropley, a 27-year-old British student from a low-income background, told CNN that he was due to attend Kansas University for one year on a scholarship, but without a visa appointment he is no longer sure. “It just feels like a kick when you are already down,” he said. “Our strategy is a waiting game, we want to see if Trump is going to backtrack.”
    


            The Canadian accepted into Harvard Law School said she was glad the institution is taking a stand against the Trump administration. “If Harvard caves, everybody caves and it's the collapse of civil society, right? If the wealthiest institution with the highest brand recognition folds, everyone folds,” she told CNN.
    


            ﻿For Nigerian journalist Akintade, who has always dreamed of studying at an Ivy League school, the feeling of rejection by the US is weighing heavily. “This is the message I'm getting: we don't want you,” she said, with a deep sigh.

MOSCOW, May 31. /TASS/. French volunteers participating in the special military operation alongside Russia are fighting to preserve traditional values and protect national interests, said Sergei Munier, commander of the Russian-French drone unit "Normandie-Niemen," which is part of the Cossack reconnaissance brigade "Terek" of the 1st assault unit of the Volunteer Corps.

"Why support Russia? Because Russia and France have quite similar histories. Since the days of ancient Rome, both France and Russia have adopted the Roman civilization — its laws and the Christian faith — and have been successors to Rome since the Middle Ages. Therefore, we grew up with the same values. Now, we understand how difficult it is for Russia to defend its interests, especially after the difficult economic situation and general collapse of the country in the 1990s," he told TASS, stressing that Russia is defending its national interests and the Russian population in Ukraine from the Kiev regime.

According to Munier, French volunteers consider France to be an occupied country that contributes to the destruction of moral values and the destruction of national industry.

"We believe that the state of France is not France at all. We are simply removing this echelon and considering ourselves direct descendants of our ancestors. That is, free France, which, at that time, was fighting alongside the Soviet Union against a common enemy that occupied France," he emphasized.

The commander pointed out about 30 Frenchmen are currently fighting alongside Russia in the special military operation, while approximately 104 have sided with Ukraine.

"Of course, there aren't as many French people fighting on Russia's side as there are in Ukraine due to the language barrier and the system of recruiting volunteers, especially foreigners. In other words, it's quite difficult for an average Frenchman with no contacts or connections to join Russia's military. Therefore, yes, we have fewer people. <…> I think that, in total, about 30 French people are fighting on Russia's side," he said.

Munier noted that, since its creation, the unit's members have worked in various areas. "This includes the assaults on Avdeyevka and Chasov Yar, as well as the liberation of the Kursk Region. Now, we have returned to the Artyomovsk area, where we worked in 2023 from the beginning," he added.

According to the commander, most Western mercenaries in the Ukrainian armed forces are far-right organization representatives, former skinheads, and football fans. However, there are also Western special service representatives among them.

"Basically, probably 99% of these people are from far-right organizations in the West. <…> In addition to them, there are also representatives of Western special services and special operations forces. These are certain specialists involved in recruitment. They organize structures for recruiting and transporting people to training camps in Ukraine and then dispatch them to the front," Munier said.

He added that there are also ordinary citizens of European countries in the Ukrainian military who went to Ukraine as volunteers. The commander pointed out that these people succumbed to Western propaganda since, from the beginning of the special military operation, French and European television channels promoted the idea of defending Ukraine.

MOSCOW, May 31. /TASS/. The four "musketeers" represented by the UK, France, Germany, and Poland will not be able to secure military victory for Ukraine, American economist, professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University Jeffrey Sachs said in an interview with TASS.

"The European Union, at least rhetorically, is already taking the lead. It's playing the tough guys. It's not the European Union exactly. It's Britain, France, Germany, and Poland, the so-called four musketeers who are going to continue the fight against Russia. But they are rhetorically saying, ‘we must continue, we must rearm, we must never surrender, we must never compromise'. And so they're actually taking the lead. Now, can they live up to those words with the military aid for Ukraine and so forth? No, in that sense, no. They can't make this military victory of Ukraine happen. This is for sure," he said.

Sachs pointed out that they did not succeed even when the US was fully on their side. "And the US is not going to be consistently on the side of anti-Russia military effort," the economist added.

California parole board says 77-year-old – the state's longest-serving female inmate – poses little risk of reoffending

A California prisons panel has recommended that Patricia Krenwinkel, serving a life sentence for her role in the 1969 Los Angeles killing spree by followers of cult leader Charles Manson, be released on parole.

The state Board of Parole Hearings found that Krenwinkel, 77 – the longest-serving female inmate in California prisons – posed little risk of reoffending based on her age and a spotless behaviour record while incarcerated, according to the CBS News affiliate in San Diego, KFMP-TV.

The state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation confirmed the finding of parole suitability, which came on Krenwinkel's 16th parole hearing, but gave no further details.

The decision on Friday amounts to a proposal subject to review by the full state Board of Parole Hearings and the California governor for up to 150 days before it can become final.

Even if the full board affirms the finding of parole suitability, the governor, Gavin Newsom, could reject it or send it back for further review.

A May 2022 parole board panel recommendation to free Krenwinkel was reversed by Newsom in August of that year.

Krenwinkel, incarcerated at the California Institution for Women, appeared with her lawyer during Friday's four-hour hearing but did not address the commissioners, KFMP reported. Several victims' family members spoke in opposition to her release.

Krenwinkel was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder in 1971 for participating in a bloody two-night rampage whose victims included actor Sharon Tate, the 26-year-old wife of film-maker Roman Polanski.

Tate, then eight months pregnant, was killed with four friends, among them coffee heiress Abigail Folger and hairstylist Jay Sebring, at the rented hillside house the actor and Polanski shared in the Benedict Canyon area of Los Angeles. Polanski was in Europe at the time.

The following night grocery owner Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, were stabbed to death in their home, where the words “Death to Pigs” and “Healter Skelter” – a misspelled reference to the Beatles song Helter Skelter – were found scrawled in the victims' blood at the crime scene.

Manson did not personally kill any of the seven victims but was found guilty of ordering their murders as part of a delusional plot to ignite a race war.

He, Krenwinkel and other members of his so-called “family” of hippies, runaways and misfits – including Leslie Van Houten, Susan Atkins and “Tex” Watson – were originally sentenced to death. Their sentences were commuted to life in prison after the California supreme court abolished capital punishment in the state in 1972.

Manson died in prison in 2017 aged 83.

Van Houten was released from prison on parole in 2023 after spending 53 years behind bars. Newsom had rejected her parole recommendation but was overruled by a California appeals court.

The governor could have petitioned the state supreme court to review the case but opted not to, deciding that further efforts to keep Van Houten locked up were unlikely to succeed.

An estimated 250 million bees are on the loose in the US state of Washington after a lorry carrying beehives rolled over on Friday.

Authorities reported that a commercial lorry carrying 70,000lbs of pollinator beehives overturned in the town of Lynden, five miles south of the border with Canada, allowing 250 million bees to make their escape.

“250 million bees are now loose,” the Whatcom county sheriff's department posted on social media.

“AVOID THE AREA due to the potential of bee escape and swarming.”

More than two dozen beekeepers assisted emergency responders – some of whom were stung – with recapturing the bees, a spokesman for the sheriff's department told local media.

The swarm of bees was so dense, it was “like a cloud”, Derek Condit, one of the beekeepers, told local media.

“It was pretty chaotic.”

Some of the beekeepers were reportedly stung over a dozen times and were using tape to plug holes in their suits.

“I've never had that many bees – angry bees – at one time,” said Russell Deptuch, another local beekeeper, in an interview with local media.

The lorry was on its way to the US state of South Dakota when it rolled over early on Friday morning.

However, it was a botched rescue mission several hours later which ultimately caused the mass flight as a tow truck attempted to pull the vehicle out of a ditch, causing the hives to fall off.

“Unfortunately, that didn't happen as smoothly as was hoped, and some of the beehives broke open, which caused all the bees to swarm, which is how we're in the situation we're in now,” said Matt Klein, the deputy director of the division of emergency management for the sheriff's department, in a statement.

The aim of the recovery operation is to save as many bees as possible and allow them to re-hive and find their queen, which the sheriff's department estimated would take one or two days.

Although there is a large number of bees needing to be recaptured, the insects are social and drawn to their hives, meaning they are likely to stay near the truck.

“That's where their queen and the next generation of bees (the ‘brood') are located,” Gene Robinson, a professor of entomology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told The New York Times.

Each hive tends to contain between 40,000 and 60,000 bees, Mr Robinson said.

As of Friday afternoon, the beekeepers and emergency responders had restored most of the hives, and the majority of the insects are expected to return by Saturday morning, the sheriff's department said.

Until then, the road has been closed and the public advised to stay at least 200 yards from the area.

Editor's Note: This story contains graphic images and descriptions of violence.



            Every night after returning home from work, Chen opens his laptop and switches to his secret life as an undercover activist.
    


            From his bedroom in eastern China, he spends hours witnessing scenes too graphic for a horror movie and trying to befriend people who would be his sworn enemies in real life.
    


            Chen – a pseudonym to protect his real identity – is part of a team of internet sleuths whose mission is to shut down a shadowy global network that mutilates and kills cats for profit.
    


            An exclusive CNN investigation shows that in the past year, these groups have expanded in scale and popularity around the world – and moved into more mainstream platforms including Telegram, X and YouTube.
    


            Consumers of these videos often have a sexual fetish for animal cruelty – known as “zoosadism” – deriving pleasure from watching the suffering of defenceless animals, experts told CNN.
    


            “It's become a pretty international phenomenon,” said Jenny Edwards, a criminologist and specialist in animal sexual abuse, based in Seattle. “It is happening much more often than people realize.”
    


            Activists say many of the cat torturers are based in China, where there are no laws against animal cruelty. Protected by an apparent culture of impunity, they make videos for consumers around the world – including in the United States, UK, Turkey and Japan.
    


            CNN has submitted questions to the Chinese government about this issue, so far without response.
    


            During a months-long investigation, CNN infiltrated some of the encrypted chat groups in China which are promoting and distributing videos of cat torture.
    


            The chat groups provide a snapshot of an underworld where torture is trivialized and celebrated as if it's part of a video game.
    


            A culture of competition has also developed among members to suggest the most inventive style of abuse – while creating heroes out of the perpetrators.
    


            CNN observed as members swapped stories of purported exploits and proposed new forms of depravity.
    


            Chen was in similar groups. For years, he's been watching gruesome videos and befriending torturers to gather enough information to track them down.
    


            He's part of an alliance of activists called Feline Guardians, who hope that drawing attention to the issue will pressure law enforcement globally to take more action – particularly in China.
    


            “China is now experiencing a wave of cat abuse, from elementary school students all the way to the elderly participating in it,” Chen said.
    


            Chen says the number of people involved in Chinese-based networks is “growing larger and larger,” and include foreigners outside the country.
    


            Data gathered by Feline Guardians showed a 500% increase in new torture videos added to the Chinese Telegram groups they monitor between June 2024 and February 2025 – with a new video being uploaded on average around every 2.5 hours. In the first two months of this year, more than 500 new torture videos have been uploaded, with most coming from previously unknown abusers.
    


            Some of this content is also available on mainstream websites, including a YouTube account seen by CNN which had “playlists” with more than 800 videos of cats being killed. After CNN requested comment, YouTube removed the channel and an associated one for “violating its policies,” and a spokesperson said, “content depicting violence or abuse toward animals has no place on YouTube.”
    


            More than 5,000 miles away from Chen in London, Feline Guardians activist Lara has been monitoring the global spread of this content.
    


            “It starts off in China, and then you have people who mimic these videos from elsewhere, (and) we have children who are exposed to this,” said Lara, who asked to only use her first name to avoid online retribution.
    


                    There is a drive with not only being able to get the satisfaction of torturing horrifically cats, but also the feedback and the notoriety that they receive
                


                    Lara, Feline Guardians activist
                


            When Lara first learned about the trade in cat torture, she said her reaction was “surely this must be embellished.” But very quickly, she had her eyes opened to the extent of this dark subculture.
    


            “They are treated like celebrities,” Lara said. “So, there is a drive with not only being able to get the satisfaction of torturing horrifically cats, but also the feedback and the notoriety that they receive.”
    


            Lara and Chen, along with their fellow activists, keep in constant contact despite most of them having day jobs – often staying up all night across different time zones as they try to track down the torturers.
    


            Their detective work involves combing through every frame of the footage, examining the background for clues on location or identity, and trying to glean information from their bank details if they are selling their content online.
    


            “Through repeatedly watching it, we can roughly determine some details about their life,” Chen said. “(Then) we can conduct some investigations locally.”
    


                    Most core groups require recording a video that volunteers can't do - that is, taking a cat from being full of life and torturing it to death
                


                    Chen, one of a group of internet sleuths whose mission is to shut down a shadowy global network that mutilates and kills cats for profit
                


            When they think they are closing the net, they also conduct interviews with local people and neighbors, in case they witnessed or overheard anything that could be used as evidence.
    


            Chen often poses as a zoosadist, who is trying to buy torture material, to gain the trust of fellow members. But some groups also demand complicity as their entry criteria.
    


            “Most core groups require recording a video that volunteers can't do – that is, taking a cat from being full of life and torturing it to death,” Chen said.
    


            Still, in the past few years, he has managed to delve so deep within Chinese torture networks that he's exposed the identities of more than a dozen perpetrators.
    


            Entering the disturbing world of these networks exposes an entire subculture with its own terminology and hierarchical structure.
    


            In forums CNN entered on mainstream websites, community members referred to themselves as “cat lovers,” partly to mock real cat lovers but also to disguise their activities.
    


            Once inside dedicated chat rooms, creators were also sometimes called “cat deleters” or “masters” and the consumers who paid for the videos were known as “sponsors.”
    


            Collectively, they appear to view themselves as vigilantes who aim to get rid of all “evil cats” – possibly also to provide a falsified sense of justification for their crimes.
    


            The creators even advertise specific cats for “torture to order” which enables buyers to select the animal, the tools and tactics of their death – all for a price.
    


                    These videos show cats being burnt alive, they have been liquefied in blenders
                


                    Lara, Feline Guardians activist
                


            Promotional posters are shared showing a photo, name and age of the cat, along with their “shelf life,” indicating the date they plan to kill them. The “sponsors” are urged to “contact customer service” to receive a quote.
    


            “There is a sadistic and twisted mindset for these torturers where they try to elongate the torture as long as possible,” said Lara.
    


            “These videos show cats being burnt alive, they have been liquefied in blenders,” Lara said. “There have been cases of cats being dismembered and their guts being pulled out and stretched.”
    


            The suffering of the animals is also turned into searchable terms – including “T-Rex” for cats that have had their front legs cut off and can only stand on their back legs.
    


            A Chinese consumer who regularly pays for this sort of gratuitously violent content admits that it gives him a sexual thrill.
    


            “Watching these videos gives me much stronger pleasure than sex,” said Zhang, who agreed to speak to CNN over the phone on the condition that we didn't use his real name.
    


            A married man in his mid-twenties, Zhang said he first started watching animal torture videos when he was a teenager, after he saw a report about it on the news.
    


            “It's just this fetish that I can't quit,” Zhang said. “This is much harder to quit than cigarettes.”
    


            So far, Zhang has spent thousands of dollars buying cat torture videos through the networks, which can cost from a few dollars to $50 each.
    


            He added that his wife “doesn't know about this thing,” and would likely divorce him if she did.
    


            Zhang says he can't afford to order the custom videos that are set at a much higher price, often over $1,300. But he says the other members are usually “rich people,” who he claims include officials, programmers and managers, some of whom share WeChat IDs showing their name, company or government department.
    


            Zhang says in the outside world, he is “quite normal” and would never personally hurt an animal – and even keeps rescued cats and dogs as pets at home.
    


            But he admits that he enjoys watching women torture cats, especially if they crush them with high heels.
    


                    They've said that they'll come and skin my dog, they're going to kill my pets and family
                


                    Phaedra, US-based independent animal rights activist
                


            Criminologist Jenny Edwards says the “primary driver” of this fetish is sadism – a “sexual deviance” which is “getting sexual arousal from watching these (videos) or feeling the pain of discomfort and humiliation of seeing another being suffering.”
    


            “It's part of antisocial, psychopathic behavior,” Edwards added.
    


            She says zoosadists often hide their proclivities from their families and friends.
    


            “They are leading a double life, because they have this whole other life that they completely keep separate from everything else that they're doing,” Edwards said.
    


            Some have threatened physical violence against activists who try to expose their secret lives.
    


            Phaedra, a US-based independent animal rights activist who asked to go only by her first name, said she was doxxed – the process of revealing someone's real identity – and targeted by anonymous accounts, after highlighting graphic torture content on X to prompt censors to take them down.
    


            Phaedra says she also tried to alert Chinese and US officials.
    


            As revenge, some of the abusers used Phaedra's photograph from her X account to create deepfake pornography of her – and one even used a photo of her as a child alongside dead cats and a sign that read “I'm coming for you Phaedra.”
    


            “They've said that they'll come and skin my dog, they're going to kill my pets and family,” Phaedra said.
    


            In December 2024, she also received death and rape threats via X.
    


            At one point, she was terrified – thinking they'd find out where she lived and come through her bedroom window – but added that she's “not afraid of them anymore.”
    


            Chen, the undercover volunteer, said most people he encounters in the groups are lonely men who feel left behind by society, which suggests they are also searching for connection within these groups – bonded by their unspeakable hobby.
    


            He described them as “incels” – involuntary celibates – who feel rejected by women and therefore get sexual pleasure from hurting an animal that most women love.
    


                    They're becoming more elaborate with what they're doing, and far more methodical
                


                    Lara, Feline Guardians activist
                


            Activists say some consumers are also drawn to this content because the screams of a cat sound similar to those of women, or children – prompting fears that the behaviors in this online underworld could develop into the abuse of humans.
    


            “They're becoming more elaborate with what they're doing, and far more methodical,” Lara from Feline Guardians said. “This will only get worse.”
    


            For example, Chen said in 2024, a sickening mission emerged to target an app called “Street Cat,” which livestreams stray cats or those in shelters for cat enthusiasts to watch.
    


            The networks hacked into the app's servers to obtain the locations, and they offered a bounty to anyone who could catch a cat, cut them into pieces, then throw the remains in front of the livestream cameras.  Street Cat declined to comment to CNN.
    


            In the US, Feline Guardians also found evidence of a crossover between cat torture and neo-Nazi groups, including one private Telegram group called “The Eternal Reich” with more than 600 members, which mixed torture content with videos of abuse against women and posts on far-right ideology.
    


            One member posted a photo of himself holding two dead cats in front of an American flag.
    


            Social media companies have come under pressure for not doing enough to prevent the proliferation of this sort of extreme, and in most places, illegal content.
    


            “The platforms are social media networks, mainly end-to-end encrypted platforms such as Telegram,” Lara said. “Also, these videos are being shared on other social media platforms like X, Instagram and Facebook.”
    


            Often potential consumers are recruited directly by the torture rings via a direct message.
    


                    The challenge is we don't have a cohesive way of attacking it
                


                    Jenny Edwards, criminologist and specialist in animal sexual abuse
                


            If they have commented on a graphic video on YouTube or Facebook, they might receive an invitation to free-to-join Telegram groups with thousands of members. Those who want more depraved content, or want to order something specific, can join smaller, more extreme Telegram groups.
    


            “It definitely needs to be restricted, and a lot of it can and should be restricted by the social media provider,” Edwards said.  “The challenge is we don't have a cohesive way of attacking it.”
    


            Edwards said in most countries legislation is too weak and inadequate to fit the extent of these crimes, and that law enforcement should be pushing tech companies to do more.
    


            CNN sent multiple requests for comment to the tech giants on their approach to this issue.
    


            “Content that promotes or glorifies violence is explicitly forbidden,” a Telegram spokesperson said, and “any groups, channels or users found distributing violent content are immediately banned.” Hundreds of moderators using AI tools are removing “millions of pieces of harmful content each day,” the spokesperson said.
    


            In January, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerburg announced sweeping changes to Facebook's online moderation policies, including reducing fact-checking while acknowledging more harmful content would appear as a result of the changes. Meta declined to comment to CNN other than to point to their policies which include removing some content that is “particularly violent or graphic.”
    


            X – which also reduced vetting following Elon Musk's takeover of social media network Twitter in 2022 – did not respond to CNN's questions on this issue.
    


            In China – which has some of the world's most tightly-controlled internet restrictions – censors rarely remove any cat torture content, Chen said.
    


            “In most situations there is no supervision of this,” Chen said. “China's censorship of political content and pornography is very strict, but with animal abuse, basically no threshold has been set.”
    


            Multiple cases of cat abuse in China have been reported by state media in the past few years, but most alleged that the perpetrators did not face any legal consequences.
    


            Other countries with animal cruelty legislation have made multiple arrests of cat torturers in recent years – including the US, Canada and Turkey.
    


            In the UK, two teenagers were recently charged with causing animal suffering, after a pair of kittens were found dead and mutilated in north-west London on May 3. The local police also wrote a letter to schools in the area, warning them of an increase in reports of young people committing acts of cruelty towards animals.
    


            In Turkey – which is known for its abundance of street cats – five members of a cat torture network were arrested in January 2024 for “abusing cats and engaging in organizational propaganda.” More arrests were made in February and September last year, including one for “torture of a kitten.”
    


            “In Turkey, within these groups, there are up to 15,000 members, possibly even more,” Lara said. “So these networks are spreading, and they mimic what the same networks in China have been doing.”
    


            The Turkish Interior Ministry did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            Activists say the role of legislation and enforcement is critical to shutting these networks down. High-profile cases in recent years include a monkey torture ring originating in Indonesia which was exposed and dismantled in 2023. British man Adam Britton was also jailed in August 2024 for torturing and sexually abusing dozens of dogs in Australia and sharing the videos on Telegram.
    


            Peter Li, an associate professor of East Asian politics at the University of Houston-Downtown and a China policy specialist for Humane Society International, says China is the only major industrialized country that does not have comprehensive anti-cruelty laws.
    


            “It's time that China adopts an anti-cruelty law,” Li said, though he conceded that it was “a politically challenging issue.”
    


            Li said multiple proposals have been submitted over the past two decades to China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress, but they have never progressed – partly due to fears they could impede the farming industry, and due to a cultural lack of concern for animal welfare among China's older generation.
    


            But with the growing number of pets in China – totalling more than 120 million in urban areas alone – the pressure to legislate for the protection of animals, especially from younger pet owners, will likely only increase.
    


            Beyond the suffering of animals, Li says there are also “broad social consequences” for allowing this trend to spiral. “You would encourage copycat behaviors,” Li said. “Most of the audience are young people, and (they) would be desensitized.”
    


            In 2024, Chinese state media reported at least four separate cases of university students allegedly torturing cats.
    


            China Daily, the country's official English-language newspaper, reported in May that “incidents of students being punished for torturing animals have been on the rise.”
    


            The article said the alleged offenders had been punished, but didn't specify what punishment they'd received, beyond at least two expulsions.
    


            “Simply expelling the students cannot solve the problem,” Wang Wenda, director of students' psychological health at Xinhua College of Ningxia University, was quoted as saying. “They might not only hurt animals but also people if they do not get proper guidance and help.”
    


            Links between cruelty to animals and to humans – documented by multiple global studies – could ultimately drive law enforcement in China – and elsewhere – to take the issue more seriously.
    


            “It starts off with cat torture,” said Lara. “There have been multiple cases of people who go off to commit other crimes, such as serial killers, but also those that we don't hear of – abuse within the home (and) maybe children.”
    


            “There is a crossover here, and so they're just acting out a fantasy through cats.”
    


            For campaigners, there's no choice but to keep going, despite the huge impact on their own mental health.
    


            “It's definitely changed the way that I view the world,” said Lara. “I believe that I have taken on something which I am committed to for the rest of my life, until this changes.”
    


            On May 18, Lara helped to organize global protests calling for an end to cat torture, held in more than 20 major cities around the world.
    


            Chen said he had sought medical support for his mental health, but he'll keep logging on every night because each sickening video takes him closer to a potential arrest.
    


            He said he'll watching in the hope of ending the depravity, because “someone has to do it, right?”

A San Francisco-based federal appeals court on Friday denied the Trump administration's bid to pause a lower court ruling that had blocked President Donald Trump's directives for workforce reductions at federal agencies from taking effect.

In a 2-1 decision, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled—with one judge dissenting—that Trump's executive order directing agency leaders to carry out mass firings “far exceeds the president's supervisory powers under the Constitution.”

            President Donald Trump traveled to Pittsburgh Friday to celebrate a deal he once vowed to oppose - Japanese steelmaker Nippon Steel's long-announced plans to buy iconic American steelmaker US Steel.
    


            “We're going to be so successful. You have just, you have just started, you watch, we're here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays and American company, you're going to stay in American company,” Trump said at a US Steel plant just outside of Pittsburgh, before an audience of steelworkers in hard hats and safety vests.
    


            And he also announced he is increasing the tariff on imported steel from 25% to 50%.
    


            “The people here understand the word tariff, you understand it better than the people on Wall Street,” he told the steelworkers. “We don't want America's future to be built with shoddy steel from Shanghai. We want it built with the strength and the pride of Pittsburgh.”
    


            But Trump said later on Friday that the deal between US Steel and Nippon Steel has not been finalized, despite the earlier celebration in Pennsylvania.
    


            “I have to approve the final deal with Nippon, and we haven't seen that final deal yet,” Trump told reporters after returning to Washington.
    


            “But they've made a very big commitment, and it's a very big investment,” Trump quickly added. “It's the largest investment in the history of the state of Pennsylvania in any deal, not just steel.”
    


            The deal to have a Japanese company purchase US Steel has drawn bipartisan opposition. President Joe Biden blocked the deal on national security grounds shortly before he left office. But a week ago, Trump announced he would approve the deal, although he described it as a “partnership” between the two companies, not a purchase. When asked Sunday about the deal, he told reporters, “It's an investment, and it'll be a partial ownership (by Nippon.)”
    


            “It will be controlled by the United States, otherwise I wouldn't make the deal,” he said.
    


            Trump did tell the crowd Friday he had previously been opposed to the deal.
    


            “They kept asking me over and over, and I kept rejecting it, no way, no way, no way,” he said. But he said the more money that Nippon agreed to put up in investments in US Steel, the more he warmed to the deal.
    


            “The deal got better and better and better for the workers,” Trump said. “I'm going to be watching over it. It's going to be great.”
    


            The appearance, and his latest announcement, appear to clear the way for the controversial deal at a time that long-time allies Japan and the United States find themselves in the middle of a trade war.
    


            Trump is threatening increased tariffs on US imports from Japan and has already imposed tariffs on all steel imports. It also introduces foreign ownership to a company that was once a symbol of American industrial might that has become a struggling afterthought in the modern US economy.
    


            US Steel CEO David Burritt and Nippon vice chairman Takahiro Mori both praised Trump at a rally at a US Steel mill ahead of the president's arrival Friday. Mori called the deal a “game changer for the next generation of steelmaking.”
    


            “Because of President Trump, US Steel will remain… made in America by Americans,” Mori said. “Thank you, Mr. President. You are saving American steel. And now we will start to make the massive investments that will transform US Steel on the world stage.”
    


            But neither executive addressed the key issue of the deal – how much of US Steel Nippon will own once the deal closes.
    


            The United Steelworkers, which represents US Steel's hourly workers in Pennsylvania and Indiana, said it is not dropping its opposition, because it believes the deal still represents a complete purchase by Nippon.
    


            “Issuing press releases and making political speeches is easy,” the union said in a statement after the rally Friday. “Binding commitments are hard. The devil is always in the details, and that is especially true with a bad actor like Nippon Steel that has again and again violated our trade laws, devastating steel communities in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.”
    


            But local union officials who represent the workers at the Pittsburgh-area plants split with the national leadership and backed the deal. Some spoke at the rally Friday in favor of the deal.
    


            Even if Nippon does own all the shares, it apparently will be with restrictions. The “control” Trump is referring to will likely come from the federal government holding so-called “golden shares” in US Steel as a condition of approval. That allows the government to approve a majority of the company's board members, who will all be American, Pennsylvania Senator David McCormick told CNBC.
    


            “That will allow the United States to ensure that production levels aren't cut,” McCormick, the Republican Senator from Pennsylvania, said Tuesday.
    


            A week after the announcement, neither company has yet said how much of US Steel Nippon will own.
    


            “US Steel will remain American, and we will grow bigger and stronger through a partnership with Nippon Steel that brings massive investment, new technologies and thousands of jobs over the next four years,” the company said in a statement last Friday following Trump's announcement.
    


            While Trump repeatedly vowed to block the deal while on the campaign trail, he has signaled since taking office that he might be open to the deal after all. In March, the administration filed a motion to extend two deadlines in a lawsuit U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel filed against the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which scrutinizes foreign investments for national security risks. Trump then ordered a new review of the acquisition in April.
    


            Trump said Sunday that members of Congress had been pushing for approval of the deal as had local unions that represent hourly workers at US Steel. But the national union officials continue to urge Trump to block the deal, calling it a “disaster for American Steelworkers, our national security and the future of American manufacturing.”
    


            US Steel has threatened that it would be forced to close some of its older, unionized mills unless the deal is completed and it gets the investment dollars needed to modernize.
    


            But the USW has said its worried Nippon's long-term goal is to shift production to its non-union operations in Texas or import steel from Japan to be finished in the United States, ending integrated steel production at the company.
    


            Nippon Steel has promised, however, to honor the union's contract with US Steel and to invest billions in integrated mills in Pennsylvania and Indiana.
    


            US Steel was once a symbol of American industrial dominance. It was the most valuable company in the world and the first to be worth $1 billion, soon after its creation in 1901. It was also crucial to the US economy throughout much of the 20th century providing the steel needed to build cars, appliances, bridges and skyscrapers, as well as weapons that helped win War War II.
    


            But it has suffered through decades of decline since its post-World War II height. It is no longer even the largest US steelmaker, and a relatively minor employer, with 14,000 US employees — 11,000 of whom are members of the USW.
    


            But it is still not a company that politicians who enjoy talking about American greatness want to see fall into foreign hands — particularly in the politically significant state of Pennsylvania. So those who support the deal have gone out of their way to suggest that it will stay American, with an American CEO and headquarters in Pittsburgh, even if it becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of a foreign rival.
    


            Trump said it is crucial to protect the American steel industry from foreign competitors.
    


            “if you don't have steel, you don't have a country,” he told the crowd. “You can't make a military. What are we going to do? Say, ‘Let's go to China to get our steel for the army tanks and for the boats and ships.' A strong steel industry is not just a matter of dignity or prosperity and pride. It's above all, a matter of national security.”
    


            He added: “For many generations, the name United States Steel was synonymous with greatness, and now it will again be synonymous with greatness.”

U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg on May 27 criticized former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for comments that alluded to the threat of World War III, calling them "reckless" and "unfitting of a world power."

"President (Donald) Trump... is working to stop this war and end the killing. We await receipt of (the Russian) Memorandum... that you promised a week ago. Cease fire now," Kellogg said on X.

The envoy's remarks came in response to a tweet from Medvedev that referenced Trump's recent warnings to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"Regarding Trump's words about Putin 'playing with fire' and 'really bad things' happening to Russia. I only know of one really bad thing — WWIII," Medvedev wrote. "I hope Trump understands this!"

Medvedev's comments refer to Trump's recent posts on Truth Social, in which he reacted to Russia's weekend aerial attacks on Ukraine, including the largest drone assault since the start of the full-scale invasion. In the posts, Trump called Putin "crazy" and warned him that he was "playing with fire."

The U.S. president has increasingly voiced frustration with stalled peace efforts, signaling readiness to walk away from the process. Despite repeated threats of sanctions, Trump has not imposed any additional pressure on Moscow to push it toward a ceasefire agreement.

Russia has repeatedly rejected Kyiv and its Western partners' proposal for an unconditional ceasefire. Following Russian-Ukrainian negotiations in Istanbul on May 16, the Russian leadership said it would present a memorandum toward a peaceful settlement.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia's delays in presenting the document are a "mockery of the whole world."


          We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war —
          and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information
          should be available to all.

Elon Musk's grandiose promises and the fiery way he tried to fulfill them stand in sharp contrast with the modest results.Nathan Howard/Reuters

Elon Musk is promising that DOGE will still find US$1-trillion in cuts to U.S. government spending and he will remain an adviser to President Donald Trump, even as the world's wealthiest person leaves Washington having achieved only a small fraction of that target.

At a White House news conference on Friday, Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump tried to project unity as the former ended his stint leading the Department of Government Efficiency, better known as DOGE after Mr. Musk's favourite cryptocurrency.

But the South African-Canadian-American billionaire had already criticized the President's centrepiece domestic policy legislation which, if passed, would increase the deficit by US$3.2-trillion, negating DOGE's cuts many times over. And the pair did not outline any plan to reach Mr. Musk's target.

“I'm confident that, over time, we will see US$1-trillion in savings,” Mr. Musk said in the Oval Office, wearing a black T-shirt reading The Dogefather. “I'll continue to be visiting here and be a friend and adviser to the President.”

U.S. President Donald Trump gives tech billionaire Elon Musk a gold-colored key for his work establishing DOGE.

The Associated Press

Mr. Trump, sitting at the Resolute desk, said that because of Mr. Musk's work, “we've found things that are unbelievably stupid and unbelievably bad” and praised DOGE's ability at “working with computers.”

Among Mr. Musk's accomplishments, Mr. Trump said, were eliminating US$2-billion “to Stacey Abrams” and US$8-million “for making mice transgender.” 

On the first, Mr. Trump appeared to be referring to a grant to Power Forward Communities, a consortium of charities running environmental programs. Ms. Abrams, whose voter registration work in Georgia may have cost Mr. Trump the state in the 2020 election, was an adviser to one of the groups. 

On the second, he was referencing National Institutes of Health studies that examined the effects of hormones in mice.

DOGE says it has cut US$165-billion in government spending. Musk Watch, a newsletter that covers the billionaire, said it can only verify US$16.3-billion of that number.

The modest outcome stands in sharp contrast with both Mr. Musk's grandiose promises and the fiery way he tried to fulfill them. After spending roughly US$275-million to help Mr. Trump get elected, he emerged as the dominant figure in the opening weeks of the new administration.

Mr. Musk's DOGE staffers – many of them university students with little previous experience – ordered layoffs, and immediate program and contract cancellations across the federal government.

In his highest-profile move, Mr. Musk shut down the entire United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. Among other things, the move meant cutting off food to civil war-ravaged Sudan, and taking away health care and education from tens of millions of people in low-income countries.

Other controversies included cuts to the health department and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and efforts to gather up Americans' personal data.

Along the way, DOGE and its leader became known for a string of strange spectacles: On one occasion, Mr. Musk wielded a chainsaw onstage at a conservative conference.

According to a New York Times report on Friday, Mr. Musk's personal life has been equally chaotic in recent years. He has been taking ketamine, ecstasy, magic mushrooms and Adderall, the newspaper reported, and impregnated multiple women while falsely telling them their relationships were exclusive.

Asked about the report, Mr. Musk refused to directly address it. He instead accused the newspaper of “lies” on a different story, over Russian interference in the 2016 election. “Let's move on. Next question,” Mr. Musk said.

He was also quiet on Mr. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Earlier in the week, Mr. Musk told CBS that he was “disappointed” in the tax-cuts-and-spending package, which “undermines the work” of DOGE.

He also criticized the legislation's plan to eliminate tax incentives for building green electricity generation and buying electric vehicles.

Mr. Musk will now turn his attention back to his own electric carmaker, Tesla, which has suffered a drop in sales since he joined up with the climate-change-denying Mr. Trump. He will also be working on xAI, an artificial intelligence company that may benefit from DOGE's efforts to replace some government workers with chatbots.

At Friday's news conference, Mr. Musk had a bruise on his face, which he said was caused by his son, X, punching him while “horsing around.” Mr. Trump, for his part, praised Mr. Musk for taking rhetorical blows.

“He willingly accepted the outrageous abuse and slander and lies and attacks,” Mr. Trump said, “because he does love our country.”

Ukraine suffered another bombardment of aerial attacks from Russia Friday night into Saturday morning as successful talks toward a peace deal to end the war appear far from happening.

There were 114 aerial attacks on Ukraine via drones and missiles overnight, with at least 10 people being killed and 33 others injured due to the Russian attacks, according to ABC News. Russia has continued heavy attacks on Ukrainian cities even as President Donald Trump attempts to broker peace and a ceasefire between the countries.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier this week that “Russian strikes are becoming increasingly brazen and large-scale every night” and has encouraged western allies, like the U.S., to exert more pressure on Russia to agree to a ceasefire and end to the war.

Trump, who was more critical of Ukraine in earlier months this year, has recently become increasingly critical of Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin.

Last weekend, Trump said he would “absolutely” consider sanctions on Russia when talking with reporters and added that he was “not happy” with Putin's continued attacks on Ukrainian cities.

On Tuesday, Trump continued to express his frustration with Russia, saying that Putin was “playing with fire.”

“What Vladimir Putin doesn't realize is that if it weren't for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD. He's playing with fire!” Trump said in a Truth Social post.

RUSSIAN AND US OFFICIALS RATCHET UP RHETORIC AS PROGRESS ON PEACE STALLS

Trump then said in remarks Wednesday that he would give the Russian president two weeks to show he was serious about ending the Russia-Ukraine war or if he was “tapping us along.”

The U.S. president had claimed on the campaign trail last year that he would quickly resolve the conflict that broke out in February 2022, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but getting the two countries to a peace deal has taken significantly longer than he predicted.

Secretary Pete Hegseth denied China's assertion that Golden Dome was an effort to turn space into a 'war zone,' arguing it was only for defense of the homeland.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued a stark warning Saturday at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore: China's military is "rehearsing for the real deal," and a full-scale invasion of Taiwan "could be imminent."

"We are not going to sugarcoat it – the threat China poses is real," he added.

CHINA LAUNCHES LARGE MILITARY DRILLS AROUND TAIWAN TO ISSUE 'SEVERE WARNING'

Beijing swiftly rejected the allegation. Rear Admiral Hu Gangfeng, head of the Chinese delegation and vice president of China's National Defense University, called the remarks "groundless accusations," stating that "some of the claims are completely fabricated, some distort facts and some are cases of a thief crying ‘stop thief.'" Despite such denials, a growing body of evidence suggests China may indeed be preparing for a military move against Taiwan.

Numerous indicators draw this conclusion. Here are nine:

1. China has intensified its joint sea and air exercises surrounding Taiwan, including rehearsals simulating blockades, encirclements, and amphibious assaults. These drills closely mirror operational strategies that would likely be employed in an actual invasion and are widely interpreted by analysts as concrete signals of Beijing's willingness to use force.

2. The Peoples' Liberation Army (PLA) has positioned H-6 bombers, capable of delivering nuclear payloads, on outposts such as Woody Island in the South China Sea. These platforms significantly extend China's strike capability and serve as strategic messaging to both Taipei and Washington.

3. China continues to conduct gray-zone operations aka non-kinetic forms of coercion, including cyberattacks on Taiwan's infrastructure, disinformation campaigns, and illegal incursions by maritime militia vessels. Though these actions fall below the threshold of open warfare, they are designed to wear down Taiwan's defenses and destabilize the region. 

4. According to U.S. intelligence assessments, Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed the PLA to be capable of launching an invasion of Taiwan by 2027. While not a confirmed deadline for action, it has catalyzed PLA modernization, emphasizing joint force integration and amphibious readiness. 

5. China's strategic expansion in Latin America – especially through Belt and Road investments and attempts to influence key nodes such as the Panama Canal reflect broader ambitions to project global power and encircle U.S. interests. These moves indirectly support Taiwan-related ambitions by distracting or overextending U.S. response capabilities.

6. Recent PLA exercises have incorporated civilian ferries capable of transporting tanks and personnel—suggesting preparations for amphibious operations on Taiwan's shores. The dual-use nature of these assets allows China to mask military buildup under the guise of civilian activity.

7. Beijing has intensified its political narrative around "reunification," including state media coverage, educational reforms, and speeches by top Chinese officials. These ideological signals often precede military action in authoritarian regimes.

8, China has rapidly expanded its coastal infrastructure, including new docks, airstrips, and logistics hubs in Fujian Province—directly across the Taiwan Strait. Satellite imagery suggests these assets are optimized for a cross-strait operation.

9. Chinese fighter jets and warships have entered Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) at unprecedented levels. In early 2025 alone, PLA aircraft breached Taiwan's ADIZ over 1,200 times, prompting elevated readiness levels in Taipei.

The question of whether China will invade Taiwan is no longer hypothetical but a matter of timing and risk calculus. While Beijing continues to deny aggressive intent, the evidence suggests a sustained and deliberate military buildup with the intent to compel reunification—if not peacefully, then by force. 

Hegseth's warning reflects not alarmism, but a sober assessment of escalating realities. These indicators—military drills, strategic deployments, political rhetoric, and infrastructure mobilization—align with historical precedents for pre-invasion posturing.

The international community must take this threat seriously. Strengthening deterrence, improving intelligence sharing, and reinforcing Taiwan's self-defense capabilities are critical to avoiding a regional catastrophe. For the United States and its allies, readiness is no longer optional—it is a strategic imperative.

VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, a confidential report by the U.N. nuclear watchdog said Saturday. In a separate report, the agency called on Tehran to urgently change course and comply with its years-long probe.

The report comes at a sensitive time, as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to reach a deal with Tehran to limit its nuclear program. The two sides have held several rounds of talks, so far without agreement. 

The report by the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency — which was seen by The Associated Press — says that as of May 17, Iran has amassed 408.6 kilograms (900.8 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%. 

That's an increase of 133.8 kilograms (294.9 pounds) — or almost 50% — since the IAEA's last report in February. The 60% enriched material is a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. A report in February put this stockpile level at 274.8 kilograms (605.8 pounds).

There was no immediate comment from Tehran on the new IAEA report.




The IAEA report raised a stern warning, saying that Iran is now “the only non-nuclear-weapon state to produce such material” — something the agency said was of “serious concern.” 

Approximately 42 kilograms of 60% enriched uranium is theoretically enough to produce one atomic bomb, if enriched further to 90%, according to the watchdog.

The IAEA report, a quarterly, also estimated that as of May 17, Iran's overall stockpile of enriched uranium — which includes uranium enriched to lower levels — stood at 9,247.6 kilograms (20,387.4 pounds). That's an increase of 953.2 kilograms (2,101.4 pounds) since February's report. 

Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so.

Iranian officials have increasingly suggested that Tehran could pursue an atomic bomb. 

U.S. intelligence agencies assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program, but has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.”

Israel said Saturday's report was a clear warning sign that “Iran is totally determined to complete its nuclear weapons program,” according to a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office.

It said IAEA's report “strongly reinforces what Israel has been saying for years — the purpose of Iran's nuclear program is not peaceful.”

It also added that Iran's level of enrichment “has no civilian justification whatsoever” and appealed on the international community to “act now to stop Iran.”

It is rare for Netanyahu to make statements on Saturday, the Jewish day of rest, underlying the urgency with which he sees the matter.

Grossi said Saturday that he “reiterates his urgent call upon Iran to cooperate fully and effectively” with the IAEA's years long investigation into uranium traces discovered at several sites in Iran. 

The IAEA also circulated to member states on Saturday a second, 22-page confidential report, also seen by the AP, that Grossi was asked to produce following a resolution passed by the 35-member IAEA Board of Governors last November.

In this so-called “comprehensive report,” the IAEA said that Iran's cooperation with the agency has “been less than satisfactory” when it comes to uranium traces discovered by IAEA inspectors at several locations in Iran that Tehran has failed to declare as nuclear sites.

Western officials suspect that the uranium traces discovered by the IAEA could provide evidence that Iran had a secret military nuclear program until 2003. 

One of the sites became known publicly in 2018 after Netanyahu revealed it at the United Nations and called it a clandestine nuclear warehouse hidden at a rug-cleaning plant.

Iran denied this but in 2019 IAEA inspectors detected the presence of manmade uranium particles there.

After initially blocking IAEA access, inspectors were able to collect samples in 2020 from two other locations where they also detected the presence of manmade uranium particles.

The three locations became known as Turquzabad, Varamin, and Marivan.

A fourth undeclared location named as Lavisan-Shian is also part of the IAEA probe but IAEA inspectors never visited the site because it was razed and demolished by Iran after 2003.

In Saturday's comprehensive report, the IAEA says that the “lack of answers and clarifications provided by Iran” to questions the watchdog had regarding Lavisan-Shian, Varamin and Marivan “has led the agency to conclude that these three locations, and other possible related locations, were part of an undeclared structured nuclear program carried out by Iran until the early 2000s and that some activities used undeclared nuclear material.”

Saturday's comprehensive report could be a basis for possible further steps by European nations, leading to a potential escalation in tensions between Iran and the West. 

European countries could move to trigger snap-back sanctions against Iran that were lifted under the original 2015 nuclear deal ahead of October, when the deal formally expires.

On Thursday, senior Iranian officials dismissed speculation about an imminent nuclear deal with the United States, emphasizing that any agreement must fully lift sanctions and allow the country's nuclear program to continue. 

The comments came a day after Trump said he has told Netanyahu to hold off on striking Iran to give the U.S. administration more time to push for a new deal with Tehran.

Trump said on Friday that he still thinks a deal could be completed in the “not too distant future.”

“They don't want to be blown up. They would rather make a deal,” Trump said of Iran. He added, “That would be a great thing that we could have a deal without bombs being dropped all over the Middle East.”

As President Donald Trump enters just his 132nd day in office on Saturday, our White House Report Card finds him in a good position.

The courts gave him wins on his tariff and immigration policy, inflation surprised by ticking down, he heralded a series of DOGE victories in bidding Elon Musk farewell, and he's getting ready to head the first modern-day military parade in Washington on June 14.

His approval rating is holding, more people than ever believe the country is heading in the right direction, and two-thirds of voters, even those who supported former Vice President Kamala Harris, like his America-first focus.

“The president's doing well,” said Democratic pollster John Zogby, one of our co-graders, though he also cited Trump's inability to nail down some really big victories.

Even more than in his first term, people view Trump as a glass half full or half empty. A Washington Post headline today, for example, screamed: “Trump plows ahead after one big, bad, sometimes ugly week full of setbacks.” At the Washington Examiner, Editor Hugo Gurdon and chief political correspondent Byron York headlined their video chat, “Trump's accomplishments getting the public's approval.”

In this week's report card, conservative Jed Babbin graded Trump's week a B-minus, noting that the “big, beautiful bill” faces hurdles in the Senate. Zogby graded it a C-minus and added a fun note that in a hypothetical election, Trump would win again.

Jed Babbin

Grade: B-

It was a pretty good week for President Donald Trump with his “Liberation Day” tariffs being struck down and quickly revived by the courts, his “One big, beautiful bill” — now OBBB — having a rocky time in Congress, and Canada asking to be covered by his Golden Dome missile defense.

Trump said Canada could get Golden Dome coverage — if it became the 51st state. The Canadians won't agree to that, but should pay tens of billions of dollars to be included.

The “Liberation Day” tariffs were struck down by a lower court and then restored at least for a while by the federal circuit. Meanwhile, Trump threatened iPhone tariffs if they're not made in the U.S. He's going to bring jobs back to the U.S. pretty much at any price.

The OBBB is having a rough time in the Senate. They'll probably amend it to death, and Trump will be stuck celebrating a bill that doesn't accomplish much of his agenda. The success of his second term depends on this bill and next year's budget reconciliation.

Trump's war with Harvard University continues. He and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have made progress by terminating student visa applications. Harvard's student body is at least 25% foreign.

Across the aisle, Democrats are leaderless with people such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) vying for the top spot. Which brings us to the wit and wisdom of Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA). He said that AOC is the reason we have directions on shampoo bottles.

Elon Musk quit the DOGE pseudo-agency which has done yeoman's work on cutting government waste. The hope is that DOGE will continue cutting and slashing away.

Meanwhile, Trump has, at long last, realized that Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn't want to make peace in Ukraine. What Trump does now may determine the freedom of Europe for the next 50 years.

John Zogby

Grade: C-

Is President Donald Trump trying to lead or simply to make one point after another?

This week witnessed the end of two bromances — one with fellow autocrat Vladimir Putin, the other with fellow narcissist Elon Musk.

Trump issued several pardons, including one for a former Chicago gang leader running a drug trade from prison, the other for reality stars Todd and Julie Chrisley. He said he is considering pardoning two men imprisoned for plotting to kidnap liberal Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. He and his sons have enriched themselves following a private dinner with cryptocurrency leaders at his New Jersey golf club.

One federal court blocked his policy of global tariffs, calling it “illegal,” but another paused that pause, allowing the president to continue for now.

A judge blocked Trump's efforts to stop Harvard University from enrolling foreign students. And the president, with the blessing of the Supreme Court, is ordering the deportation of about 3,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans who were here legally and called vital to the community's agriculture, poultry, and other industries. Curiously, these folks tend to be militantly anti-communist and conservative, and voted Republican when they achieve citizenship.

One poll seems to show Trump losing ground among young men. But a new poll by John Zogby Strategies does not find that at all. What's more, the president is in a dead heat or even slightly ahead against any of several possible Democratic contenders in 2028.

PARIS (AP) — When Jannik Sinner's opponent in the French Open's third round finally won a single game Saturday, the Court Suzanne-Lenglen crowd responded with a standing ovation. Sinner was simply too good on this day, extending his Grand Slam winning streak to 17 matches and looking very much like the No. 1-ranked man.

Sinner dominated Jiri Lehecka 6-0, 6-1, 6-2 in just 1 hour, 34 minutes, the quickest men's match at Roland-Garros this year and, measured by games lost, the most lopsided victory at a major tournament of Sinner's career.

“We try to improve,” Sinner said. “Today, I don't think there are many things I can improve.”

Can say that again.

Check out some of the numbers: Sinner delivered 31 winners and made only nine unforced errors. He accumulated 18 break points, converting seven, and faced just one, which he saved.

The first 11 games went Sinner's way. When Sinner missed a return wide, making the score 6-0, 5-1 after 55 minutes of action, Lehecka raised his arm and pumped his fist in a bit of sarcastic celebration. The fans went wild, rising out of their seats and clapping and shouting, eliciting a smile from Lehecka.

Make no mistake, though. Lehecka is no also-ran. The 23-year-old from the Czech Republic is ranked 34th and has been a Grand Slam quarterfinalist.

But he was completely overmatched by Sinner, who has won the past two major championships — at the U.S. Open in September and the Australian Open in January — and is now the owner of an unbeaten run at the sport's most important tournaments that's been surpassed this century only by a trio of guys by the names of Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

Sinner's bid for a first French Open title, and fourth Slam trophy overall, will continue Monday, when he'll face No. 17 Andrey Rublev for a quarterfinal berth. Rublev advanced when his opponent, No. 14 Arthur Fils, withdrew from the tournament because a stress fracture in his lower back.

Jessica Pegula, the No. 3-seeded American who was the runner-up at the U.S. Open, came back to eliminate 2019 French Open finalist and 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 and reach the fourth round. Another American, 70th-ranked Hailey Baptiste, made it into Week 2 at a major for the first time by beating Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 7-6 (4), 6-1 and will play Madison Keys or Sofia Kenin next. No. 6 Mirra Andreeva, an 18-year-old Russian who reached the semifinals a year ago, advanced to a fourth-round showdown against No. 17 Daria Kasatkina. American qualifier Ethan Quinn, the 2023 NCAA champion for the University of Georgia, played his second consecutive five-setter and was beaten by Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands 4-6, 6-1, 6-7 (2), 6-1, 6-4. Griekspoor came into the day 0-4 in third-round matches at majors. Griekspoor next meets 2024 runner-up Alexander Zverev, while No. 5 Jack Draper takes on Alexander Bublik. Draper defeated 18-year-old Brazilian João Fonseca 6-2, 6-4, 6-2.

No. 1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka and the two defending champions, Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz, are all scheduled to appear in the fourth round Sunday. There are three American men in Week 2 in Paris for the first time since 1995, and all are in action: No. 12 Tommy Paul, No. 13 Ben Shelton and No. 15 Frances Tiafoe. Shelton faces Alcaraz, Paul goes up against No. 25 Alexei Popyrin and Tiafoe meets Daniel Altmaier.

US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee spoke exclusively to Fox News Digital on the US-Israel relationship, Iran, prospects for a hostage deal, and enlarging the Abraham Accords. (Video: Yoav Dudkevitch/TPS-IL for Fox News Digital.)

EXCLUSIVE - The United States will not participate in a conference next month in New York City hosted by France and Saudi Arabia aimed at promoting the recognition of a Palestinian state, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview in Jerusalem earlier this week.

"It's incredibly inappropriate in the midst of a war that Israel is dealing with to go out and present something that I think increasingly Israelis are steadfast against.

"Oct. 7 changed a lot of things. If France is really so determined to see a Palestinian state, I have a suggestion for them–carve out a piece of the French Riviera and create a Palestinian state. They are welcome to do that, but they are not welcome to impose that kind of pressure on a sovereign nation. And I find it revolting that they think they have the right to do such a thing.

TRUMP'S MIDDLE EAST TRIP HANDED ISRAEL A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY — IF IT CHOOSES TO ACT, EXPERTS SAY

"I hope they will reconsider but the U.S. will not participate. It simply will not be a part of such a ruse," he added.

Huckabee, commenting on recently reported tensions between the two close allies, noted there may be disagreements between the Trump administration and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, but there should be no fear of a rupture in bilateral ties.

"I don't think pro-Israel Americans need to be concerned that there's some rift between the United States and Israel. Are there sometimes differences of opinion on the next steps in the war in Gaza, getting the hostages home, or maybe to avoid an all-out war with Iran? Of course, that's natural," he said.

"But as far as the relationship between Israel and the U.S., that is not in any way at risk, nor is it in any way splintered or fractured. It's solid, it has to be. We don't have a choice. It's critically important that the United States maintains its partnership—and I use that word very deliberately—it's not a friendship, it's not an alliance, it's a partnership, which means we are yoked together in our intelligence sharing, military — so many ways in which our nations are linked inseparably."

On talks between Washington and Tehran, the ambassador described the Islamic Republic as "one of the if not the greatest, threats to world peace," warning that it poses a serious and immediate existential threat not only to Israel, but also to several Gulf nations and ultimately to the United States.

"The Iranians have said Israel is the ‘Little Satan,' but America is the ‘Great Satan.' They've always treated Israel as the appetizer and the United States as the entrée," he said. "It's just important when people tell you over and over for 46 years they plan to kill you, you might want to start taking them seriously."

Nevertheless, Huckabee expressed hope that ongoing nuclear negotiations between the two nations would be successful and avoid any kind of military conflict.

IRAN WARNS ISRAEL AND US 'CAN'T DO A DAMN THING' TO THWART TEHRAN NUCLEAR AMBITIONS AS TENSIONS ESCALATE

"But when diplomacy fails, the soldiers show up," he said.

"I find it hard to believe the Iranians, after all these years of pushing towards a nuclear device that is weaponized, would suddenly come to their senses and say we've changed. We don't want that anymore, but let's hope they do. But if they don't, the president has been incredibly clear that Iran is not going to have a nuclear weapon."

On Israel's ongoing war against Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip, he emphasized that the suffering could end immediately—if Hamas chooses to act.

"All of us are hoping and praying that Hamas will finally give up all the hostages and release them, and then they will depart Gaza for good. If they do these two things, this is over," he said. "It could have been over on Oct. 8, 2023; it should have been. What they did was unthinkable, horrific, heinous, uncivilized, savage behavior."

He noted that President Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted that Hamas has no future in Gaza. "They can't rule it, they can't stay," said Huckabee.

"Israel has been clear that they are willing to put them on airplanes and fly them out in exile, they have a way out, but they don't have a way in. They have to go, and all hostages living and dead have to be returned," he added.

Huckabee expressed hope that this would happen immediately.

Speaking to Fox News Digital on Thursday, he said of the hostages, "This pin that I wear on my lapel—one of the happiest days of my life will be when I can take this pin off and permanently put it away, never to wear it again, because that means all of the hostages have come home," he said.

He also expressed confidence in the prospect of expanding the Abraham Accords, forged during Trump's first term, which normalized relations between Israel and four Arab states: the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco.

While not naming new countries considering joining, Huckabee said, "There are a number of nations that now realize that having enmity with Israel is meaningless," he said. "It is a delicate path for some countries; they can't go faster than their people are willing to go and accept … but there is a great atmosphere and possibility that we will see some dramatic changes and big additions to the Abraham Accords."

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — In the southeastern Utah desert famous for red rock arches and canyon labyrinths, the long-dormant uranium mining industry is looking to revive under President Donald Trump.

Hundreds of abandoned uranium mines dot the West's arid landscapes, hazardous reminders of the promise and peril of nuclear power during the Cold War. Now, one mine that the Trump administration fast-tracked for regulatory approval could reopen for the first time since the 1980s.

Normally it would have taken months, if not years, for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to review plans to reopen a project like Anfield Energy's Velvet-Wood mine 35 miles (56 kilometers) south of Moab. But the bureau's regulators green-lit the project in just 11 days under a “national energy emergency” Trump has declared that allows expedited environmental reviews for energy projects. 

More permits and approvals will be needed, plus site work to get the mine operating again. And the price of uranium would have to rise enough to make domestic production financially sustainable. If that happens, it would mean revival — and jobs — to an industry that locally has been moribund since the Ronald Reagan era.

“President Trump has made it clear that our energy security is national security,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in announcing the fast-tracking policy in April. “These emergency procedures reflect our unwavering commitment to protecting both.”

More fast approvals appear likely. Trump's order also applies to oil, gas, coal, biofuel and hydropower projects — but not renewable energy — on federal lands.

Global uranium prices are double what they were at a low point seven years ago and, for the past year, the U.S. has banned uranium imports from Russia due to that country's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

More domestic mining would address a major imbalance. The U.S. imports about 98% of the uranium it uses to generate 30% of the world's nuclear energy. More than two-thirds of U.S. imports come from the world's top three uranium-mining countries: Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan.

Less government regulation won't spur more U.S. uranium mining by itself. The market matters. And while spot-market prices are up from several years ago, they're down about a third from their recent high in early 2024.

While some new uranium mining and processing projects have been announced, their number falls far short of a surge. That suggests prices need to rise — and stay there — for a true industry revival, said John Uhrie, a former uranium executive who now works in the cement industry.

“Until the price goes up dramatically, you're not going to be able to actually put these places into operation,” Uhrie said. “You need significant capital on the ground.”

Still, the industry is showing new life in the Southwest. 

Anfield Energy, a Canadian company, also looks to reopen the Shootaring Canyon uranium mill in southern Utah near Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. It closed in the early 1980s. A uranium mill turns raw ore into yellowcake, a powdery substance later processed elsewhere into nuclear fuel.

Anfield officials did not return messages seeking comment on plans to reopen the mill and the Velvet-Wood mine.

Energy Fuels, another Canadian company which ranks as the top U.S. uranium miner, opened the Pinyon Plain mine about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the Grand Canyon in late 2023.

And just off U.S. 191 in southeastern Utah is a hub of the industry, Uranium Fuels' White Mesa mill, the country's only uranium mill still in operation.

These days, Moab is a desert tourism hot spot bustling with outdoor enthusiasts. But the town of 5,200 has a deeper history with uranium. Nods to Moab's post-World War II mining heyday can been spotted around town — the Atomic Hair Salon isn't just named for its blowout hairstyles.

The biggest reminder is the Moab Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action project, a 480-acre (194-hectare) site just outside town. The decades-long, $1 billion U.S. Department of Energy effort to haul off toxic tailings that were leaching into the Colorado River upstream from the Grand Canyon and Lake Mead should wrap up within five more years.

That mill's polluting legacy makes some Moab residents wary of restarting uranium mining and processing, especially after the Trump administration cut short their ability to weigh in on the Velvet-Wood mine plans.

“This was a process I would have been involved in,” said Sarah Fields, director of the local group Uranium Watch. “They provided no opportunity for the public to say, ‘You need to look at this, you need to look at that.'”

Grand Canyon Trust, a group critical of the Pinyon Plain mine as a danger to groundwater, points out that the U.S. nuclear industry isn't at risk of losing access to uranium.

“This is all being done under the assumption there is some energy emergency and that is just not true,” said Amber Reimondo, the group's energy director. 

Hundreds of miles to the north, other nuclear energy projects point to the U.S. industry's future.

With Bill Gates' support, TerraPower is building a 345-megawatt sodium-cooled fast reactor outside Kemmerer in western Wyoming that could, in theory, meet demand for carbon-free power at lower costs and with less construction time than conventional reactor units.

Meanwhile, about 40% of uranium mined in the U.S. in 2024 came from four Wyoming “in-situ” mines that use wells to dissolve uranium in underground deposits and pump it to the surface without having to dig big holes or send miners underground. Similar mines in Texas and Nebraska and stockpiled ore processed at White Mesa accounted for the rest.

None — as yet — came from mines in Utah.

Powering electric cars and computing technology will require more electricity in the years ahead. Nuclear power offers a zero-carbon, round-the-clock option.

Meeting the demand for nuclear fuel domestically is another matter. With prices higher, almost 700,000 pounds of yellowcake was produced in the U.S. in 2024 — up more than a dozen-fold from the year before but still far short of the 32 million pounds imported into the U.S.

Even if mining increases, it's not clear that U.S. capacity to turn the ore into fuel would keep pace, said Uhrie, the former uranium mining executive. 

“Re-establishing a viable uranium industry from soup to nuts — meaning from mining through processing to yellow cake production, to conversion, to enrichment to produce nuclear fuel — remains a huge lift,” Uhrie said.

            One of the reasons politicians don't often engage in massive overhauls of the American economy is that it's very difficult to defend a massive overhaul of the American economy. However good any given plan is, it often produces losers and – even in the best of cases – some short-term pain.
    


            And repeatedly now as President Donald Trump has launched multiple massive overhauls, prominent Republicans have learned that the hard way.
    


Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa is the most recent.
    


            Appearing at a town hall on Friday, Ernst was pressed on cuts to Medicaid – the health care program for low-income Americans – in House Republicans' budget plan. One audience member shouted that “people will die.”
    


            The usual politician thing would have been to take issue with that premise – or to, as other Republicans have strained to do, cast the Medicaid cuts as merely cutting waste and abuse. (That's not the full story, of course; the Congressional Budget Office recently projected that House Republicans' changes to Medicaid, including work requirements for some recipients, would leave 7.6 million Americans uninsured by 2034.)
    


            But Ernst decided to go in a different direction.
    


            “Well, we all are going to die,” said Ernst, who's facing reelection in 2026.
    


            When hostile portions of the crowd balked at the response, she said: “For heaven's sakes, folks.”
    


            The senator and her office argued Friday that Republicans are in fact trying to “strengthen” Medicaid. A spokesman said: “There's only two certainties in life: death and taxes, and she's working to ease the burden of both by fighting to keep more of Iowans' hard-earned tax dollars in their own pockets and ensuring their benefits are protected from waste, fraud, and abuse.”
    


            Ernst in her remarks went on to accuse her critics of not wanting to “listen to me when I say that we are going to focus on those that are most vulnerable. Those that meet the eligibility requirements for Medicaid, we will protect … them.”
    


            As a contrast, she cited an oft-invoked GOP claim that 1.4 million undocumented immigrants are receiving Medicaid benefits. But that's not actually what the CBO estimate says – nor does it account for the other millions of people the CBO says would lose insurance.
    


            In other words, however bad Ernst's answer was, it might just be that there's not a good answer to be given. Republicans needed to cut spending to pay for Trump's tax cuts, and it's hard to cut enough unless you cut entitlements. It's a political minefield that even some Trump allies like Steve Bannon have warned their party about.
    


            And indeed, Democrats quickly leapt to highlight Ernst as the epitome of an uncaring, Medicaid-busting Republican.
    


            But Ernst is not the first to wander into this kind of territory. Repeatedly in recent weeks, prominent Republicans who have been asked to account for the pains caused by Trump's bold plans have stumbled into similar territory.
    


            Trump himself has repeatedly talked about how the price increases created by his tariffs might mean people have to buy fewer dolls for little girls.
    


            “You know, someone said, ‘Oh, the shelves, they're going to be open,'” Trump said. “Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.”
    


            Trump said on the campaign trail that foreign countries would pay the extra cost of the tariffs, not consumers.
    


            Conservative Daily Wire founder Ben Shapiro called Trump's comments “a tremendous commercial for Democrats” and urged Trump to avoid language that minimized the impacts of inflation.
    


            Back in March, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick addressed the administration's chaotic changes to the Social Security system by claiming that only “fraudsters” would complain about missing a Social Security check. He pointed to his own mother-in-law. (The administration has pursued a series of sometimes halting changes to the Social Security system, including limiting claims to in-person rather than over the phone – something it later walked back – and cutting staff.)
    


            “Let's say Social Security didn't send out their checks this month. My mother-in-law, who's 94 – she wouldn't call and complain,” Lutnick said. He added: “She just wouldn't. She'd think something got messed up, and she'll get it next month. A fraudster always makes the loudest noise – screaming, yelling and complaining.”
    


            It's logical to assume that Lutnick's mother-in-law wouldn't complain, given her son-in-law is a billionaire. But according to the Social Security Administration, more than 1 in 10 seniors rely on the program for at least 90% of their income.
    


            Are any of these game-changing gaffes? Not necessarily. But they are certainly fodder for Democrats to argue that Trump is pursuing a rather haphazard and callous overhaul of the American economy. It's the kind of thing Bannon warns about in cautioning Republicans against Medicaid cuts. There just aren't many good ways to defend millions of poor people being projected to lose their health insurance.
    


            And if the early evidence is any indication, it's going to result in plenty of awkward defenses in the future.

Dr. Devi Nampiaparampil joins 'Fox News Live' to discusses Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s MAHA report on childhood disease.

Sperm from a single donor in Europe has reportedly been used to conceive at least 67 pregnancies, although the donor carried a rare cancer-causing mutation.

The donor's mutation has been linked to cancer diagnoses in 10 of these children, according to a report by The Guardian.

The case was brought to light after two families separately contacted their fertility clinics after their children's cancer diagnoses were linked to a rare genetic variant called TP53.

PROSTATE CANCER RISK INCREASES BY 45% AMONG MEN WHO SHARE ONE TROUBLING BEHAVIOR

A mutation in the TP53 gene causes Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which increases the risk of developing cancer. Cleveland Clinic states that this disorder comes with a 90% chance of developing some type of cancer by age 60, and a 50% chance by the age of 40.

The European Sperm Bank, the sperm supplier, confirmed that this variant was present in some of the donor's sperm.

Researcher Dr. Edwige Kasper (not pictured) advocates for a European limit on the number of births or families for a single donor. (iStock)

The Guardian reported that the rare variant was "not known to be linked to cancer at the time of donation in 2008."

The genetic variant reportedly would not have been detectable through standard screening, and the donor is said to currently be in good health.

"The identified mutation is one that could not have been detected by the screening methods we use in accordance with regulations."

Dr Edwige Kasper, a biologist at Rouen University Hospital in France, presented this case at the European Society of Human Genetics' annual conference in Milan last week, commenting on the need for a European limit on the number of births or families for a single donor.

"We can't do whole-genome sequencing for all sperm donors – I'm not arguing for that," she told The Guardian. "But this is the abnormal dissemination of genetic disease. Not every man has 75 children across Europe."

4 TROUBLING CANCER TRENDS YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT IN 2025

Kasper analyzed the mutation in her lab, concluding that it was most likely cancer-causing and that children born from this donor should "receive genetic counseling."

The research-turned-investigation tracked down 67 children from 46 families in eight European countries. The children were tested, with the variant detected in 23 of them.

The 10 who had been diagnosed with cancer reportedly included cases of leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

In a statement sent to Fox News Digital, the European Sperm Bank stated that donor-assisted reproduction "generally remains a significantly safer alternative" than reproduction without genetic screening.

The bank added that sperm donors undergo a "comprehensive health screening," which includes an in-depth medical examination, a review of the donor's family medical history and "extensive" testing for genetic and infectious diseases.

"However, it's not possible to rule out all risks — and, in this particular case, the identified mutation is one that could not have been detected by the screening methods we use in accordance with regulations and would require specialized genetic testing," the group noted.

Julie Paulli Budtz, VP. of corporate communications at the European Sperm Bank, expressed to Fox News Digital that they are "deeply affected by this case."

"The donor has been thoroughly tested even beyond the required standards, but preventative genetic screening is reaching its limits here," she said. 

"Every human being has about 20,000 genes, and it is scientifically simply not possible to detect disease-causing mutations in a person's gene pool if you don't know what you are looking for."

Budtz noted that the European Sperm Bank welcomes "continued dialogue" regarding setting an "internationally binding family limit," which they have advocated for "on several occasions, also at EU level." 

"This is also why, in addition to complying with national pregnancy limits, we have proactively implemented our own international limit of 75 families per donor," she added.

In the U.S., there is no official legal limit on how many sperm donations one man can make.

However, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) recommends that donors are limited to 25 live births within each population area of 800,000 people.

"Institutions, clinics and sperm banks should maintain sufficient records to allow a limit to be set for the number of pregnancies for which a given donor is responsible," the ASRM states on its website.

"Limiting donor vials is an important part of the process."

California Cryobank, which has claimed to have the largest selection of sperm and egg donations in the country, states on its website that it closely monitors donors to limit the total number of family units to 20 to 30 worldwide. 

"Limiting donor vials is an important part of the process," the bank noted.

The U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) requires that all sperm donors undergo a physical exam, complete a questionnaire, provide their medical history, and undergo screenings for infectious diseases at an FDA-approved lab.

In addition, the ASRM suggests that donors undergo psychological and genetic screening, and also recommends infectious-disease testing of the recipient and the recipient's sexually intimate partners, per its website.

"Legal consultation and laws may vary by state," the organization notes.

At California Cryobank, donors must be tested for infectious diseases, undergo genetic screening, get a psychological assessment and criminal background check, and receive screening for the Zika virus, according to the bank's website.

Hundreds of foreign companies left Russia after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, including major U.S. firms like Coca-Cola, Nike, Starbucks, ExxonMobil and Ford Motor Co. 

But after more than three years of war, President Donald Trump has held out the prospect of restoring U.S.-Russia trade if there's ever a peace settlement. And Russian President Vladimir Putin has said foreign companies could come back under some circumstances. 

“Russia wants to do largescale TRADE with the United States when this catastrophic ‘bloodbath' is over, and I agree,” Trump said in a statement after a phone call with Putin. “There is a tremendous opportunity for Russia to create massive amounts of jobs and wealth. Its potential is UNLIMITED.”

The president then shifted his tone toward Putin after heavy drone and missile attacks on Kyiv, saying Putin “has gone absolutely crazy” and threatening new sanctions. That and recent comments from Putin warning Western companies against reclaiming their former stakes seemed to reflect reality more accurately — that it's not going to be a smooth process for businesses going back into Russia.

That's because Russia's business environment has massively changed since 2022. And not in ways that favor foreign companies. 

And with Putin escalating attacks and holding on to territory demands Ukraine likely isn't going to accept, a peace deal seems distant indeed. 

Here are factors that could deter U.S. companies from ever going back:




Russian law classifies Ukraine's allies as “unfriendly states” and imposes severe restrictions on businesses from more than 50 countries. Those include limits on withdrawing money and equipment as well as allowing the Russian government to take control of companies deemed important. Foreign owners' votes on boards of directors can be legally disregarded.

Companies that left were required to sell their businesses for 50% or less of their assessed worth, or simply wrote them off while Kremlin-friendly business groups snapped up their assets on the cheap. Under a 2023 presidential decree the Russian government took control of Finnish energy company Fortum, German power company Unipro, France's dairy company Danone and Danish brewer Carlsberg. 

Even if a peace deal removed the U.S. from the list of unfriendlies, and if the massive Western sanctions restricting business in Russia were dropped, the track record of losses would remain vivid. And there's little sign any of that is going to happen.

While the Russian government has talked in general about companies coming back, “there's no specific evidence of any one company saying that they are ready to come back,” said Chris Weafer, CEO of Macro-Advisory Ltd. consultancy. “It's all at the political narrative level.” 

Russia's actions and legal changes have left “long-lasting damage” to its business environment, says Elina Ribakova, non-resident senior fellow at the Bruegel research institute in Brussels. 

She said a return of U.S. businesses is “not very likely.” 

In a meeting at the Kremlin on May 26 to mark Russian Entrepreneurs Day, Putin said that Russia needed to throttle large tech firms such as Zoom and Microsoft, which had restricted their services in Russia after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, so that domestic tech companies could thrive instead.

“We need to strangle them,” Putin said. “After all, they are trying to strangle us: we need to reciprocate. We didn't kick anyone out; we didn't interfere with anyone. We provided the most favorable conditions possible for their work here, in our market, and they are trying to strangle us.”

He reassured a representative from Vkusno-i Tochka (Tasty-period) — the Russian-owned company that took over McDonald's restaurants in the country — that Moscow would aid them if the U.S. fast food giant tried to buy back its former stores. Asked for comment, McDonald's referred to their 2022 statement that “ownership of the business in Russia is no longer tenable.”

On top of Russia's difficult business environment, the economy is likely to stagnate due to lack of investment in sectors other than the military, economists say. 

“Russia has one of the lowest projected long-term growth rates and one of the highest levels of country risk in the world,” says Heli Simola, senior economist at the Bank of Finland in a blog post. “Only Belarus offers an equally lousy combination of growth and risk.” 

Most of the opportunity to make money is related to military production, and it's unlikely U.S. companies would work with the Russian military-industrial complex, said Ribakova. “It's not clear where exactly one could plug in and expect outsize returns that would compensate for this negative investment environment.”

Some companies, including Renault and Ford Motor Co., left with repurchase agreements letting them buy back their stakes years later if conditions change. But given Russia's unsteady legal environment, that's tough to count on.

The Russian purchasers may try to change the terms, look for more money, or ignore the agreements, said Weafer. “There's a lot of uncertainty as to how those buyback auctions will be enforced.”

Multinational oil companies were among those who suffered losses leaving Russia, so it's an open question whether they would want to try again even given Russia's vast oil and gas reserves. US.. major ExxonMobil saw its stake in the Sakhalin oil project unilaterally terminated and wrote off $3.4 billion. 

Russia's major oil companies have less need of foreign partners than they did in the immediate post-Soviet era, though smaller oil field services might want to return given the size of Russia's oil industry. But they would have to face new requirements on establishing local presence and investment, Weafer said. 

According to the Kyiv School of Economics, 2,329 foreign companies are still doing business in Russia, many from China or other countries that aren't allied with Ukraine, while 1,344 are in the process of leaving and 494 have exited completely. The Yale School of Management's Chief Executive Leadership Institute lists some two dozen U.S. companies still doing business in Russia, while some 100 more have cut back by halting new investments. 

U.S. sanctions are considered the toughest, because they carry the threat of being cut off from the U.S. banking and financial system. But the EU is still slapping new rounds of sanctions on Russia. Even if U.S. sanctions are dropped, EU sanctions would continue to present compliance headaches for any company that also wants to do business in Europe.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland is set to hold a presidential runoff election on Sunday between two candidates offering starkly different visions for the country's future.

The winner will succeed President Andrzej Duda, a conservative who is finishing his second and final term. The outcome will determine whether Poland embraces a nationalist populist trajectory or pivots more fully toward liberal, pro-European policies. An exit poll by Ipsos will be released when polls close on Sunday at 9 p.m. local time, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. Final results are expected Monday.

Whoever wins can be expected to either help or hinder the agenda of the centrist government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk thanks to the presidential power to veto laws.

The vote comes amid heightened regional tensions driven by Russia's war in neighboring Ukraine, security concerns across Europe and internal debates about the rule of law.

It follows a first round on May 18, in which Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski won more than 31% of the vote and Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian, earned nearly 30%. Eleven other candidates were eliminated.

Opinion polls show the two men running neck and neck. Other factors add to the unpredictability. Nawrocki did much better in the first round than surveys had predicted, indicating that his strength was underestimated. On the other hand, large numbers of Poles abroad have registered to vote in the second round, which could help Trzaskowski.

Nawrocki is a 42-year-old historian who was tapped as by the national conservative Law and Justice party despite a lack of political experience or party membership. But this is seen as acting in his favor, as the party, which governed for 2015-2023, seeks to refresh its image before a parliamentary election in 2027.

Nawrocki's supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic Polish values. They believe U.S. President Donald Trump's support for him will strengthen Poland's ties with the United States and make the country safer.

Trzaskowski, 53, is Warsaw's mayor and a close ally of Tusk. A deputy leader of Civic Platform, a pro-European Union party, he has been prominent in national politics for years. This is his second presidential bid after narrowly losing to Duda in 2020.

Supporters credit him with modernizing Warsaw through infrastructure, public transit expansion and cultural investments. He is widely seen as pragmatic and focused on strengthening ties with other European nations.

Nawrocki recently received a boost from Trump and other U.S. conservatives, who see the Polish election as part of a global battle between liberal and populist right-wing forces. 

His campaign has echoed themes popular on the American right, including skepticism toward EU bureaucracy and emphasis on Christian identity. His supporters feel that Trzaskowski, with his pro-EU views, would hand over control of key Polish issues to Paris and Berlin.

Nawrocki also has been endorsed by the Trump administration and conservative Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

Many European centrists are rooting for Trzaskowski, seeing in him someone who would defend democracy as it faces pressure from authoritarian forces across the globe. He has received the support of new centrist Romanian President Nicusor Dan — who recently defeated a far-right nationalist.

Nawrocki has faced a number of scandals over the past months, but it's not clear that they are hurting him. In fact, they might have the opposite effect. Many right-wing voters don't believe the allegations and accuse the media of using its power to hurt him, creating what appears to be a rallying effect around him.

Nawrocki himself has acknowledged that he took part in an organized brawl including football hooligans in 2009. A former boxer, he said he has taken part in various forms of “noble male battle” in his life.

Polish media have also reported on his connections to gangsters and the world of prostitution.

Tusk accused Law and Justice party leader Jarosław Kaczynski of tapping Nawrocki despite questions about his past. 

“You knew about everything, Jarosław. About the connections with the gangsters, about ‘fixing girls,'” Tusk wrote on X. “The entire responsibility for this catastrophe falls on you!”

1. Security and war in Ukraine: With Russia's war in Ukraine in its fourth year, Polish voters are acutely attuned to issues of regional security. Both candidates support continued backing for Ukraine, but to different degrees. Nawrocki believes that Ukraine should never join NATO, while Trzaskowski believes Ukraine should be allowed to join one day when the current war is over.

2. Rule of law and democracy: Trzaskowski has pledged to support the restoration of judicial independence and repair relations with the EU, which viewed changes by Law and Justice as anti-democratic. Tusk has tried to change some legislation, but has faced resistance from the the outgoing president, Duda. Nawrocki, while less outspoken than his party patrons, is seen as likely to preserve Law and Justice's changes that politicized the courts.

3. Women's rights: Abortion remains a divisive issue in Poland, especially after a near-total ban was imposed under Law and Justice. Trzaskowski supports loosening restrictions and has backed proposals to legalize abortion up to 12 weeks. Nawrocki opposes any liberalization and has campaigned as a defender of traditional conservative values.

China has launched a space probe that will travel to an asteroid near Mars to collect samples and find potential "groundbreaking" results.

The Tianwen-2 probe launched Thursday from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province aboard the workhorse Long March 3-B rocket, according to the China National Space Administration (CNSA).

The target of the Tianwen-2 will be different from its predecessor, the Tianwen-1, which launched a year ago and landed on Mars.

Tianwen-2 will be aiming for the asteroid 2016 HO3, which is also known as 469219 Kamoʻoalewa, to bring back samples.

The proposed 10-year plan would involve more than just this space mission as China continues to look to expand into space.

Zhang Rongqiao, chief designer of the Tianwen-1, told China Central Television he plans to implement the "Tianwen-3" Mars sampling return mission in 2028, while the "Tianwen-4" will head toward Jupiter.

According to The Associated Press, the asteroids, chosen for their relatively stable orbits, will hopefully offer clues about the formation of Earth, such as the origins of water.

Samples from 2016HO3 are due to be returned in about two years. 

Even if the CNSA is going to distribute these samples to international partners like they have on previous missions, NASA wouldn't be able to receive any samples.

A law passed in 2011, known as the Wolf Amendment, restricts NASA from having any cooperation with the CNSA.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright recounted how Biden-era policies 'strangled' Alaska's energy growth during his address at the Reagan National Economic Forum.

SIMI VALLEY, CALIFORNIA – Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said that the Biden administration "strangled" the state of Alaska with restrictions and red tape that was beyond levels imposed on North Korea, Iran and Venezuela combined. 

"Alaska, a state that has had more sanctions, more restrictions on production of oil and gas in Alaska than everything we did to Iran and Venezuela and North Korea if they produced any combined. You know, the last administration just strangled Alaska. This awesome state of immense natural resources," Wright said from the Reagan National Economic Forum in Simi Valley, California. 

Wright joined the inaugural Reagan National Economic Forum on Friday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library to celebrate President Donald Trump's executive orders "unleashing American energy" and how the administration is tackling regulations that have prevented the growth of coal and nuclear energy in recent history. Fox News' Maria Bartiromo moderated the energy-focused panel. 

He pointed to the Gulf of America and Alaska as two key areas for American energy growth, most notably in the Last Frontier State.

"Alaska has been this great resource. It boomed and then it's been strangled. The idea is we export oil from the north slope of Alaska, comes by pipeline to southern Alaska, and then exported," he said. "We want to build a pipeline from the north slope of Alaska that brings natural gas, not just oil. And then an oil, a natural gas export terminal on the southern coast of Alaska that in six days can sail to Tokyo or Taiwan or Korea. And then down to our allies in East Asia. So they're getting energy from us. But it would be awesome and great from a geopolitical stance to have a very short supply chain between a huge industrial American facility and our allies in East Asia."

Wright added that the Gulf of America is a key area of the country to build massive export terminals, where American energy can be exported to foreign nations. 

"The export terminals today are almost entirely on the Gulf of America, on the Texas and Louisiana coast. And they're there because you can build things there. The natural gas comes from Pennsylvania, Ohio or North Dakota or Texas or Oklahoma. The gas comes from all over. But that's where you can build these giant facilities to export it," he said.

"We were, not long ago, the largest importer of oil in the world and the largest importer of natural gas in the world. Today, we're the largest exporter of natural gas and a net exporter of oil," he continued.

"Who's the biggest importer of oil in the world and the biggest importer of natural gas in the world? Both China. We have an incredible energy system advantage over China. But we should use it not just to the benefit of our country, but to bring security and tight alliances with our allies as well."

The European Union on Saturday criticized President Donald Trump's move to double tariffs on steel imports, warning that it "undermines" efforts to reach a "negotiated solution" in the ongoing trade war.

"We strongly regret the announced increase of U.S. tariffs on steel imports from 25% to 50%," an EU spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News.

"This decision adds further uncertainty to the global economy and increases costs for consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic," the spokesperson continued.

The spokesperson added that the EU is "prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to the latest U.S. tariff increase."

The United Steelworkers union (USW) also criticized Trump's announcement and said it is a "direct attack on Canadian industries and workers."

"Thousands of Canadian jobs are on the line and communities that rely on steel and aluminum are being put at risk," Marty Warren, United Steelworkers National Director for Canada, said in a statement.

"Canada needs to respond immediately and decisively to defend workers."

Trump on Friday announced that he planned on doubling tariffs on steel imports to 50% from 25%, increasing the pressure on manufacturers dependent on industrial metals for production.

The new import duties are set to go into effect June 4.

His announcement, made at a rally at U.S. Steel in Pennsylvania, came after the president signaled earlier this month that he would approve a controversial deal between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel.

Trump highlighted an "agreement" between Nippon and U.S. Steel during the Friday rally, but said that the deal was not yet final.

He said that there will be no layoffs and "no outsourcing whatsoever" due to the deal.

The EU, which said that it had paused its countermeasures against the U.S. on April 14 "to allow time and space" for negotiations, said it is prepared to instate those measures "if no mutually acceptable solution is reached."

"The European Commission is currently finalizing consultations on expanded countermeasures," the spokesperson said. "If no mutually acceptable solution is reached, both existing and additional EU measures will automatically take effect on 14 July — or earlier, if circumstances require."

The Trump administration's tariff plan hit a snag this week after the U.S. Court of International Trade halted nearly all of Trump's country-specific tariffs on the grounds that he had exceeded his authority.

The court's order to cancel the tariffs was swiftly paused, at least for now, by an appeals court.

Despite the pause, the ruling has thrown a wrench into the administration's broader trade strategy, which relies on the threat of high tariffs to create leverage and force countries to renegotiate their trade deals with the U.S.

Tracee Ellis Ross, actress and daughter of music icon Diana Ross, is known for her bubbly personality, and seems to keep an optimistic attitude while juggling her responsibilities.

"I feel like my natural state is joyful, and yet I work at it," Ross, 52, said during the New York Times Well Festival earlier this month.

"I think joy is different from happiness. I feel like happiness is something you can get at 7/11, and joy is something that you earn and work for and takes practice."

Prioritizing joyfulness daily is a choice that requires intention, she said. Small moments like making up catchy tunes when she's feeling overwhelmed are what helps her to shift back into a positive state.

"I have a group of friends that I have a gratitude and fear list that we write together every morning," she said.

"To acknowledge and name and put words to the things that actually light up your soul and your heart. I think they allow a balance and a perspective."

Sharing both what she's grateful for and what she's nervous about with her close friends allows Ross to accept that life is a mixed bag of good moments and not-so-great ones.

"But if you can mix them in with the right kind of perspective and focus on the stuff that is working, I find that I can have a space of joy in my life," she said.

Ross shared an example on how she shifted her perspective when faced with a challenge. The night before the festival she couldn't sleep well and was only able to rest for four and a half hours, despite the eventful day she had planned.

"Instead of saying I feel overwhelmed, I use the word, 'My plate is wonderfully full,'" she said.

On her ride through New York City before arriving at the festival, Ross wrote on her gratitude list that she was grateful for a bright blue sky, career abundance and "spring New York energy."

"I think joy is an attitude. I think joy is a perspective, and I think joy is a lens through which I live and look at my life," Ross said.

Parenting advice has gotten really complicated. There's something new every day, and it's filled with contradictions. Every time you think you understand something, it changes. All of this is a huge source of anxiety for many parents.

As a psychiatrist on the front lines of healthy youth development, I've worked with over 3,000 young adults. And as a mom of three kids, I've spent two decades on both sides of the journey through parenthood.

But parenting doesn't have to be complicated. Here are five simple rules to help you navigate the way-too-much-counterproductive-information age.

Evolution didn't prepare you to drive a car or negotiate a mortgage, but it did prepare you to be a parent, much more so than most people realize.

This means parenting is an area of adult life where it really is okay to follow a hunch and do what feels right. Think about going outside on a cold day. If you feel cold, do you consult a chart or a professional before reaching for a jacket? No. You just kind of know how to stave off hypothermia even if, like most people, you have never experienced it.

Parenting is much closer to intuitively bundling up on a cold day than it is to signing your first mortgage. It's okay to trust your instincts, although they're not going to prepare you for every little thing. That's where culture comes in.

Any culture that has survived more than a couple of hundred years has robust child-rearing traditions. And any enduring culture has answers for parents — traditions around feeding, rest, socialization, purpose and the transition to adulthood.

Now, you probably don't think of your own cultural heritage in this way, you probably just think about it as whatever old-fashioned stuff your parents did. Not sure what they did? Ask them! Older siblings, cousins, aunts and uncles are also great.

Who would I not listen to? Someone who has never met you or your child, who knows nothing about your value system, or is selling you something — or all three.

All kids are different. Some like singing, some like trucks. For the latter, spending half the day riding the city bus can be paradise. Pediatricians often recommend singing classes because many kids enjoy singing, and there is evidence that it's good for language development.

But if you take kid who loves trucks to a singing class, you might make a lot of people unhappy, starting with yourself and your kid.

Do you know what else is good for language development? Spending half the day watching a construction site! Many construction vehicles have names that are long and difficult to pronounce, but a kid who likes heavy machinery will outstrip your truck vocabulary in a week or two. You'll find yourself wondering why you have never contemplated questions like: What's the difference between a backhoe and an excavator?

One of the great joys of parenthood is seeing the world through their eyes. Follow them as often as you can.

You're raising a kid, not a spreadsheet, so leave the developmental tables to the teachers and pediatricians. That stuff is important for screening purposes, but can cause a lot of unnecessary anxiety.

Child development rolls out in fits and spurts, not in a perfectly linear fashion. If your kid seems basically okay, they are probably basically okay. (See rule #1!) If they don't seem okay, consult with your child's pediatrician or teacher, depending on the issue.

But many parents could benefit from dialing up the joy and dialing down the obsessing. With kids, enjoyment is development. They learn best when they are happy and relaxed, and engaged in playful activities with people who care about them.

What your child needs more than anything is your love and attention. Parents tie themselves in knots trying to be perfect. It's not necessary, and it's not authentic.

It's okay to show a range of emotions, as long as you don't lose control. This is how children learn that emotions are normal, and to manage their own. Kids are constantly bathed in emotions, and emotional modulation is one of their most important developmental tasks.

Worried parents tend to think our times present a unique set of challenges for raising kids, which is true. But it's also true that every generation of parents since time immemorial has had the same worry, and they got through. So will you.

Iran carried out secret nuclear activities with material not declared to the U.N. nuclear watchdog at three locations that have long been under investigation, the watchdog said in a wide-ranging, confidential report to member states seen by Reuters.

The findings in the "comprehensive" International Atomic Energy Agency report requested by the agency's 35-nation Board of Governors in November pave the way for a push by the United States, Britain, France and Germany for the board to declare Iran in violation of its non-proliferation obligations.

A resolution would infuriate Iran and could further complicate nuclear talks between Tehran and Washington.

Using the IAEA report's findings, the four Western powers plan to submit a draft resolution for the board to adopt at its next meeting the week of June 9, diplomats say. It would be the first time in almost 20 years Iran has formally been found in non-compliance.

Tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and has long denied accusations by Western powers that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.

While many of the findings relate to activities dating back decades and have been made before, the IAEA report's conclusions were more definitive. It summarized developments in recent years and pointed more clearly towards coordinated, secret activities, some of which were relevant to producing nuclear weapons.

It also spelled out that Iran's cooperation with IAEA continues to be "less than satisfactory" in "a number of respects." The IAEA is still seeking explanations for uranium traces found years ago at two of four sites it has been investigating. Three hosted secret experiments, it found.

The IAEA has concluded that "these three locations, and other possible related locations, were part of an undeclared structured nuclear programme carried out by Iran until the early 2000s and that some activities used undeclared nuclear material", the report said.

Nuclear material and/or heavily contaminated equipment from that program was stored at the fourth site, Turquzabad, between 2009 and 2018, it said.

"The Agency concludes that Iran did not declare nuclear material and nuclear-related activities at three undeclared locations in Iran, specifically, Lavisan-Shian, Varamin, and Turquzabad," the report said.

At Lavisan-Shian in Tehran, a disc made of uranium metal was "used in the production of explosively-driven neutron sources" at least twice in 2003, a process designed to initiate the explosion in a nuclear weapon, the report said, adding that it was part of "small-scale" tests.

The report is likely to lead to Iran being referred to the U.N. Security Council, though that would probably happen at a later IAEA board meeting, diplomats said.

More immediately, it is likely to lead to Iran again accelerating or expanding its rapidly advancing nuclear programme, as it has done after previous rebukes at the board. It could also further complicate talks with the United States aimed at reining in that program.

A separate IAEA report sent to member states on Saturday said Iran's stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% of weapons grade, had grown by roughly half to 408.6 kg. That is enough, if enriched further, for nine nuclear weapons, according to an IAEA yardstick.

Both IAEA reports said enrichment to such a high level was "of serious concern" since it is the only country to do so without producing nuclear weapons.

Israel, which has long urged strong action against Iran's nuclear programme, said the IAEA report showed Tehran was determined to complete its nuclear weapons programme. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the world should act now to stop Iran from doing this.

U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA have long believed Iran had a secret, coordinated nuclear weapons programme that it halted in 2003. Iran denies ever having had one.

Lyft (LYFT) is a multimodal transportation network in the United States and Canada. It offers access to a variety of transportation options through its platform and mobile-based applications. The Lyft Platform provides a marketplace where drivers can be matched with riders via the Lyft App, where it operates as a transportation network company. Transportation options through its platform and mobile-based applications are substantially comprised of its ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders in cities across the United States and in certain cities in Canada, Lyft's network of bikes and scooters, and the Express Drive program, where drivers can enter into short-term rental agreements with its subsidiary, Flexdrive Services, LLC or a third party for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft Platform. It makes the ridesharing marketplace available to organizations through Lyft Business offerings, such as the Concierge and Lyft Pass programs.

Activist Commentary: Engine Capital is an experienced activist investor led by Managing Partner Arnaud Ajdler, former partner and senior managing director at Crescendo Partners. Engine's history is to send letters and/or nominate directors but settle rather quickly.

On March 25, Engine announced a position in Lyft and stated that they are calling for a strategic review, improved capital allocations and the elimination of the company's dual-class share structure. On April 16, Engine nominated two directors for election to the Board at the 2025 annual meeting, but ultimately withdrew those nominations following productive engagement with the company that led to several capital allocation initiatives, including the company committing to significant share repurchases in the coming quarters.

Since David Risher took control as CEO of Lyft in 2023, Lyft has made some major improvements, streamlining operations, enhancing platform functionality, and expanding market presence. These have led to notable material enhancements in the company's operational and financial performance. From 2023 to 2024, revenue increased by 31.39%, EBITDA went from a negative$359.1 million to $27.3 million and free cash flow (FCF) increased from negative $248.06 million to $766.27 million, the latter two of which are in the green for the first time since its IPO. Despite these improvements, Lyft's share price decreased by 30% over the same period.

There are a few factors that may help explain the company's current undervaluation. First is the industry's dynamics as Lyft operates in a duopoly with Uber in the rideshare market. In the US, Uber holds approximately 75% percent of the market while Lyft holds 24% with the rest controlled by niche areas (i.e. Curb, Alto, and Waymo). The company is in an inherently difficult strategic position due to Uber's dominance — while Lyft is only in the US and Canada, Uber is diversified across most global markets and has expanded into other synergetic areas like food and alcohol delivery. This makes Lyft particularly vulnerable to Uber's decisions regarding pricing and promotions, as management noted during the company's most recent earnings call. The market has sensed this situation, with Lyft's shares underperforming compared to Uber by 37%, 287%, and 210% over the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, respectively. Second to this is Lyft's suboptimal capital allocation practices. The company has experienced excessive share dilution. Since 2019, Lyft's shares outstanding have almost doubled. Currently, dilution is primarily caused by the company's stock-based compensation (SBC) practices, which are currently around $330 million annually, 4.9% of Lyft's market cap.

Enter Engine, who is calling for a strategic review, improved capital allocation practices and the elimination of the company's dual-class share structure. These proposals are all worth evaluating. First, there are a few reasons why a strategic review, specifically a potential strategic acquisition, makes sense. As has been already discussed, one of, if not the largest challenge Lyft faces is their inability to scale and diversify at the pace of Uber. As the rideshare industry continues to grow and evolve, this will only become increasingly important to Lyft's potential long-term success. It seems like the most effective way to overcome this is to be either sold to or merged with a larger strategic entity that can give Lyft the scale and diversification it needs to compete with Uber.  Large players in the food delivery or automotive industry make sense as potential acquirers. For example, Doordash, with a roughly $80 billion market cap, could easily afford Lyft, has synergies to better optimize both platforms, a global presence, and would create more revenue stream options for drivers. On the other hand, automative companies testing the rideshare autonomous vehicle industry like Google (Waymo) and Amazon (Zoox), which is potentially the next technological evolution in the rideshare space, also make sense as acquirers. Given Lyft's depressed valuation (EV to 2026 consensus EBITDA multiple of approximately 6.6x), recent growth, and large number of potential synergies, a large takeout premium is certainly possible here.

Secondly, the company clearly needs to improve its capital allocation practices. While Lyft recently announced a $500 million buyback program, this is not even sufficient to counter the dilution over the next two years due to current SBC practices. With $2 billion of cash (approximately $700 million of net cash) and the company dramatically increasing their FCF, it appears that Lyft has the ability to much more aggressively repurchase shares to do more than just counter SBC dilution.

Lastly, as a corporate governance investor, Engine will propose eliminating the dual-class structure. Originally set up to give control to the founders, this structure now seems unnecessary since co-founders John Zimmer and Logan Green are no longer involved in day-to-day operations. These preferred shares carry 20 votes per share, which give them 30.8% of the total voting power while owning only approximately 2.3% of outstanding shares. Eliminating the dual-class share structure makes complete sense, is the right thing to do and would be supported by the vast majority of shareholders. However, there is virtually no way that Zimmer and Green will voluntarily give up this control position. As an experienced activist investor Ajdler knows that, but also as an experienced activist investor, he has to try. But at the very least, the Company can refine the board to reflect the changes over the past six years since its IPO – seven of the ten current directors have no public company experience other than Lyft - the Board has a lean towards directors with experience in startup companies or early-stage investments. While this background may have once been valuable, that is not where Lyft is as a Company anymore. A refreshment of these directors for people with public market, capital allocation and capital markets expertise, would better position the Company for what it is today.

After launching a proxy fight for two board seats, this campaign came to a head when Engine withdrew their director nominations on May 8. This withdrawal came following the company's public announcement to increase its share repurchase authorization to $750 million and commit to utilize $200 million of such authorization over the next three months and $500 million within the next 12 months.

In this article

During the depths of the Covid pandemic, with restaurants around the country facing an existential crisis, DoorDash CEO Tony Xu had an unconventional proposal. He wanted to cut commissions.

Chief Business Officer Keith Yandell worried that such a move would result in a massive hit to profits ahead of the company's planned IPO. But Xu made a persuasive case.

"If restaurants don't thrive, we cannot," Yandell told CNBC in a recent interview, recalling Xu's perspective at the time. "We need to take a leadership position."

The company ended up sacrificing over $100 million in fees, Xu later said.

Since starting DoorDash on the campus of Stanford University in 2013, the now 40-year-old CEO has navigated the notoriously cutthroat and low-margin business of food delivery, building a company that Wall Street today values at close to $90 billion. The stock has emerged as a tech darling this year, jumping 23%, while the Nasdaq is still down for the year largely on tariff concerns.

More than four years after its IPO, net profits remain slim. But that's not getting in the way of Xu's mission to become an industry consolidator, using a combination of cash and new debt to fuel an acquisition spree at a time when big tech deals remain scarce. Earlier this month, DoorDash scooped up British food delivery startup Deliveroo for about $3.9 billion and restaurant technology company SevenRooms for $1.2 billion.

"What we've delivered for a customer yesterday probably isn't good enough for what we will deliver for them today," Xu told CNBC's "Squawk Box" after the deals were announced.

This week DoorDash announced the pricing of $2.5 billion in convertible debt, and said the proceeds could be used in part for acquisitions.

The San Francisco-based company has a history with scooping up competitors to grow market share. In 2019, it bought food delivery competitor Caviar for $410 million from Square, now known as Block. About two years later, DoorDash said it was paying $8.1 billion for international delivery platform Wolt. The deal was its last big transaction until this month.

When DoorDash entered the food delivery market, it had to face off against the likes of GrubHub and Seamless, which later joined forces. That combined entity was bought late last year by restaurant owner Wonder Group. In 2014, Uber launched Uber Eats, which is now DoorDash's biggest competitor in the U.S.

"It's a very competitive market, and I think merchants do have choice," Xu said in the CNBC interview. "What we're focused on is always trying to innovate and bring new products to match increasing standards and expectations from customers."

DoorDash didn't make Xu available for an interview for this story, but provided a statement about the company's acquisition strategy.

"We're very picky, very patient, and conscious that, for most companies, deals don't work out in hindsight," the company said. "When we see an opportunity that brings value to customers, expands our potential to empower local economies around the world, and has a path to strong long-term returns on capital, we tend to push our chips in."

DoorDash differentiated itself early on by cornering suburban markets that had fewer delivery options, while other players attacked city centers. When Covid shut down restaurant dining in early 2020, DoorDash capitalized on the booming demand for deliveries. Revenue more than tripled that year, and grew 69% in 2021.

Colleagues and early investors credit a customer-first focus for much of Xu's success. Gokul Rajaram, who joined DoorDash through its Caviar acquisition, described Xu as "the best operational leader in the U.S." after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

Restaurants haven't universally viewed DoorDash as an ally. Commissions can reach as high as 30%, which is a hefty cut to fork over. Many restaurants have reluctantly paid the high fees because of DoorDash's dominant market share, which reached an estimated 67%. In 2021, the company introduced three tiers of pricing, with a basic option at 15% for more price-sensitive businesses.

DoorDash needs the high fees in order to stay in the black. The company's contribution profit as a percentage of total marketplace volume hovers below 5%.

Colleagues who have known Xu for decades say the food delivery entrepreneur hasn't changed much since the early days of the company.

Yandell said Xu once took advice from his young daughter, who complained about a routing issue while accompanying him on food delivery orders. All employees, including Xu, are required to complete orders and handle support calls every year as part of the company's WeDash program.

In a part of the country known for the pomp of its wealthy founders, Xu has a very different reputation.

Early workers recall memories of Xu pulling up in a dilapidated green 2001 Honda Accord to team events, or participating in company knockout basketball games referred to as "knockys," next to the animal hospital in Palo Alto, which DoorDash briefly called its headquarters. Xu also personally approved every offer for the company's first 4,000 employees.

Xu spends many mornings answering customer service complaints. He often drops his kids off at school and, after tucking them in at night, hops on calls with international regions, colleagues say. Xu is an avid Gold State Warriors basketball fan but has a soft spot for the Chicago Bulls, having spent many years in Illinois. Once or twice a week, Xu squeezes in a morning run, and will often do so while traveling to explore different neighborhoods and stores.

Xu was born in China and moved with his family to Champaign, Illinois, in 1989. Growing up, he played basketball and mowed lawns to save up for a Nintendo. He told Stanford's View From the Top podcast in 2021 that the experience, and watching his parents hustle, taught him how to "earn your way into better things."

His "characteristics became the company's values," said Alfred Lin, an early DoorDash investor and partner at venture firm Sequoia.

Xu often attributes his entrepreneurial spirit to his parents. His mother worked as a doctor in China, and juggled three jobs in the U.S. for over a decade, saving up enough to eventually open a medical clinic. His father worked as a waiter while pursuing a Ph.D. Xu said on the podcast that watching his mom gave him a deep understanding of what it takes to run a small business, which came in handy in DoorDash's early years as he was trying to convert restaurants into customers.

Employees say Xu has a reputation for detecting hidden talents among his colleagues. Jessica Lachs, the company's chief analytics officer, was working as a general manager assisting with DoorDash's Los Angeles launch when Xu guided her toward her passion for data.

"He believes in leaning into the things you're really good at, rather than trying to be mediocre at a lot of things," she said.

After Toby Espinosa, DoorDash's ads vice president, lost a deal with a major fast food company during his early years at the startup, Xu told him to work "10 times harder" and become an expert in his field. A few years later, the company secured the partnership, Espinosa said.

Grit and struggle defined the early years of DoorDash. The founding team of four managed deliveries around Stanford and Palo Alto though a Google Voice number directed to their cellphones.

DoorDash emerged out of a Stanford business school course known as Startup Garage, taught by Professor Stefanos Zenios. The class requires students to present a business idea, test it, and then pitch it to investors.

Zenios said Xu stood out with his data-driven approach and natural leadership qualities. The team tested two different ideas, including a platform that helped small businesses better track the effectiveness of their marketing, he recalls. Zenios called the idea to target suburban areas a "brilliant insight."

Xu and his team entered Y Combinator in the summer of 2013. The three-month startup accelerator program is known for spawning companies like Airbnb, Stripe and Reddit. Every session culminates with a demo day in front of some of Silicon Valley's biggest investors.

The DoorDash idea excited Paul Buchheit, creator of Gmail and a partner at Y Combinator. But like many other potential investors, Buchheit was skeptical about the economic model.

"You had a talented team of founders working on what I thought was an idea that had potential," he said. "That's basically the formula for a good startup."

On pitch day, the company failed to lure any venture firms, but Buchheit later participated as a seed investor.

Shortly after demo day, DoorDash encountered Saar Gur of Charles River Ventures. Gur had been looking for a food delivery platform to back and was conducting due diligence on another company when a friend led him to DoorDash.

By the end of their first meeting, they were "finishing each other's sentences," Gur said.

Sequoia's Lin initially passed on DoorDash after the Y Combinator pitch, but kept in touch with the team. Lin said he wanted to see data that showed the platform could penetrate beyond Stanford and Palo Alto, and retain customers. He ended up leading two institutional rounds, attaining a 20% stake for Sequoia at the time of the IPO.

"Tony always believed that his company would succeed, or they'll find a way to succeed," Lin said.

Shortly after its Y Combinator stint, DoorDash hit an early roadblock. Following a Stanford football game, a rush of orders bombarded its delivery system causing massive delays, Xu told Y Combinator's CEO Garry Tan in an interview this year.

The founders refunded the orders and spent the night baking cookies, then driving them to customers early the next morning.

Oren's Hummus co-owner Mistie Boulton said DoorDash still takes that approach. The team comes to meet with her every quarter and she serves as a beta tester for new products.

The restaurant, which started in Palo Alto and has since expanded to a half-dozen locations across the Bay Area, was one of DoorDash's first clients, latching onto the opportunity to reach more customers beyond its small establishment that frequently had lines snaking out the door. 

"We just fell in love with the idea," Boulton said. "The number one thing that encouraged and enticed me to want to work with them was Xu's passion. He really is one of those people that you can count on."

Wall Street is now counting on Xu's ability to execute big deals, even with the company having this month surpassed $10 billion in delivery orders worldwide.

The acquisition of Deliveroo, based in London, marks a renewed effort by DoorDash to expand its presence overseas, following the purchase of Finland's Wolt three years ago.

The cash deal for SevenRooms, a New York City-based data platform for restaurants and hotels to manage booking information, takes DoorDash into an entirely new category. Xu told CNBC that DoorDash is a "multi-product company now that's operating on a global scale."

Following the acquisition announcements, which coincided with a disappointing earnings report in March, analysts at Piper Sandler reiterated their hold recommendation on the stock.

One reason for concern, they said, was that "integrating multiple acquisitions at once may create some noise near-term."

In this article

Sarah Kapnick started her career in 2004 as an investment banking analyst for Goldman Sachs. She was struck almost immediately by the overlap of financial growth and climate change, and the lack of client advisory around that theme.

Integrating the two, she thought, would help investors understand both the risks and opportunities, and would help them use climate information in finance and business operations. With a degree in theoretical mathematics and geophysical fluid dynamics, Kapnick saw herself as uniquely positioned to take on that challenge.

But first, she had to get deeper into the science.

That led her to more study and then to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the nation's scientific and regulatory agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce. Its defined mission is to understand and predict changes in climate, weather, oceans and coasts and to share that knowledge and information with others.

In 2022, Kapnick was appointed NOAA's chief scientist. Two years later, JPMorgan Chase hired her away, but not as chief sustainability officer, a role common at most large investment banks around the world and a position already filled at JPMorgan.

Rather, Kapnick is JPMorgan's global head of climate advisory, a unique job she envisioned back in 2004.

Just days before the official start of the North American hurricane season, CNBC spoke with Kapnick from her office at JPMorgan in New York about her current role at the bank and how she's advising and warning clients.

Here's the Q&A: 

(This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.) 

Diana Olick, CNBC: Why does JPMorgan need you?

Sarah Kapnick, JPMorgan global head of climate advisory: JPMorgan and banks need climate expertise because there is client demand for understanding climate change, understanding how it affects businesses, and understanding how to plan. Clients want to understand how to create frameworks for thinking about climate change, how to think about it strategically, how to think about it in terms of their operations, how to think about it in terms of their diversification and their long-term business plans.

Everybody's got a chief sustainability officer. You are not that. What is the difference?

The difference is, I come with a deep background in climate science, but also how that climate science translates into business, into the economy. Working at NOAA for most of my career, NOAA is a science agency, but it's science agency under the Department of Commerce. And so my job was to understand the future due to physics, but then be able to translate into what does that mean for the economy? What does that mean for economic development? What does that mean for economic output, and how do you use that science to be able to support the future of commerce? So I have this deep thinking that combines all that science, all of that commerce thinking, that economy, how it translates into national security. And so it wraps up all these different issues that people are facing right now and the systematic issues, so that they can understand, how do you navigate through that complexity, and then how do you move forward with all that information at hand?

Give us an example, on a ground level, of what some of that expertise does for investors.

There's a client that's concerned about the future of wildfire risk, and so they're asking, How is wildfire risk unfolding? Why is it not in building codes? How might building codes change in the future? What happens for that? What type of modeling is used for that, what type of observations are used for that? So I can explain to them the whole flow of where is the data? How is the data used in decisions, where do regulations come from. How are they evolving? How might they evolve in the future? So we can look through the various uncertainties of different scenarios of what the world looks like, to make decisions about what to do right now, to be able to prepare for that, or to be able to shift in that preparation over time as uncertainty comes down and more information is known

So are they making investment decisions based on your information?

Yes, they're making investment decisions. And they're making decisions of when to invest because sometimes they have a knowledge of something as it's starting to evolve. They want to act either early or they want to act as more information is known, but they want to know kind of the whole sphere of what the possibilities are and when information will be known or could be known, and what are the conditions that they will know more information, so they can figure out when they want to act, when that threshold of information is that they need to act.

How does that then inform their judgment on their investment, specifically on wildfire?

Because wildfire risk is growing, there've been a few events like the Los Angeles wildfires that were recently seen. The questions that I'm getting are could this happen in my location? When will it happen? Will I have advanced notice? How should I change and invest in my infrastructure? How should I think about differences in my infrastructure, my infrastructure construction? Should I be thinking about insurance, different types of insurance? How should I be accessing the capital markets to do this type of work? It's questions across a range of trying to figure out how to reduce vulnerability, how to reduce financial exposure, but then also, if there are going to be risks in this one location, maybe there are more opportunities in these other locations that are safer, and I should be thinking of them as well. It's holistically across risk management and thinking through risk and what to do about it, but then also thinking about what opportunities might be emerging as a result of this change in physical conditions in the world.

But you're not an economist. Do you work with others at JPMorgan to augment that?

Yes, my work is very collaborative. I work across various teams with subject matter experts from different sectors, different industries, different parts of capital, and so I come with my expertise of science and technology and policy and security, and then work with them in whatever sphere that they're in to be able to deliver the most to the bank that we can for our clients.

With the cuts by the Trump administration to NOAA, to FEMA, to all of the information gathering sources — we're not seeing some of the things that we normally see in data. How is that affecting your work?

I am looking to what is available for what we need, for whatever issue. I will say that if data is no longer available, we will translate and move into other data sets, use other data sets, and I'm starting to see the development out in certain parts of the private sector to pull in those types of data that used to be available elsewhere. I think that we're going to see this adjustment period where people search out whatever data it is they need to answer the questions that they have. And there will be opportunities. There's a ton of startups that are starting to develop in that area, as well as more substantial companies that have some of those data sets. They're starting to make them available, but there's going to be this adjustment period as people figure out where they're going to get the information that they need, because many market decisions or financial decisions are based on certain data sets that people thought would always be there.

But the government data was considered the top, irrefutable, best data there was. Now, how do we know, when going to the private sector, that this data is going to be as credible as government data?

There's going to be an adjustment period as people figure out what data sets to trust and what not to trust, and what they want to be using. This is a point in time where there is going to be adjustment because something that everyone got used to working with, they now won't have that. And that is a question that I'm getting from a lot of clients, of what data set should I be looking for? How should I be assessing this problem? Do I build in-house teams now to be able to assess this information that I didn't have before? And I'm starting to see that occurring across different sectors, where people are increasingly having their own meteorologist, their own climatologist, to be able to help guide them through some of these decisions.

Final thoughts?

Climate change isn't something that is going to happen in the future and impact finance in the future. It's something that is a future risk that is now actually finding us in the bottom line today.

LAS VEGAS — The bitcoin treasury play that lifted Strategy's market cap past $80 billion is now being mimicked by meme stock companies, media firms, and multinational conglomerates. But Wall Street isn't buying all the hype.

This week, Trump Media announced plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, and GameStop revealed a $500 million allocation. Meanwhile, Tether, SoftBank, and Strike's Jack Mallers unveiled Twenty One, a bitcoin-native public company expected to launch with more than 42,000 bitcoin on its balance sheet, enough to make it the third-largest corporate holder of the asset globally.

For now, the market doesn't see the next Strategy in any of them. Trump Media shares have dropped more than 20% since the announcement, while GameStop is down nearly 17%. Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has multiplied by 26 times since the end of 2022, amassing a bitcoin stake worth over $60 billion.

"Maybe the market wanted them to buy more bitcoin," said Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor in an interview at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas. "But these are short-term dynamics. Over the long term, bitcoin on the balance sheet has proven to be extraordinarily popular."

Saylor called Trump Media's move "courageous, aggressive, and intelligent" — and said the flood of similar announcements marks a global shift in corporate finance.

"Everywhere I go at this conference, someone says, you know, I'm working on a bitcoin treasury company in Hong Kong. I'm doing this thing in Korea. I've got this thing I'm working on in Abu Dhabi. We're going to do this in the Middle East, you know, we've got this in the U.K.," he said. "There's an explosion of interest right now."

Saylor said bitcoin ambassadors are "planting the orange flag everywhere on earth."

What began as a fringe financial maneuver is quickly becoming a geopolitical race. Under the Biden administration, corporate bitcoin adoption was often treated as a regulatory red flag. But under President Donald Trump, the tone has changed.

In March, Trump signed an executive order establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, instructing federal agencies to treat bitcoin as a long-term store of value. The reserve will be funded entirely through bitcoin seized in criminal and civil forfeiture cases, according to White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks. The order also empowers the government to explore additional budget-neutral mechanisms for acquiring more bitcoin.

For the first time, the federal government will conduct a full audit of its digital asset holdings, currently estimated at more than 200,000 bitcoin. The order explicitly prohibits the sale of any bitcoin from the reserve, cementing its role as a permanent sovereign asset.

Vice President JD Vance this week became the first sitting vice president to address the bitcoin community directly, framing crypto as a hedge against inflation, censorship, and "unelected bureaucrats." And in a further move to boost bitcoin, the Department of Labor rolled back guidance that had discouraged bitcoin investments in retirement plans.

"No force on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come," Saylor said. "Bitcoin is digital capital and maybe the most explosive idea of the era."

Some corners of the corporate world are still resistant. Late last year, Microsoft shareholders rejected a proposal to use some of the software company's massive cash pile to follow Saylor's lead. In a video presentation supporting the effort, Saylor told investors that "Microsoft can't afford to miss the next technology wave."

While Strategy has reaped the rewards of early adoption, Saylor suggested the market's cooler reaction to Trump Media and GameStop may stem more from structural financing dynamics than from skepticism toward bitcoin itself.

He pointed to GameStop's initial announcement that it was considering a bitcoin strategy, which led to a 50% pop in the stock and tenfold increase in trading volume. The company quickly capitalized on the momentum with a $1.5 billion convertible bond raise — a move he described as "extraordinarily successful." Trump Media took a similar approach, raising capital through a large convertible bond offering.

Saylor said those financing methods can create short-term downward pressure, but that over time investors will benefit.

When it comes to Strategy, Saylor said there's no ceiling to his bitcoin accumulation plans. His company is already by far the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency.

"We'll keep buying bitcoin," he told CNBC. "We expect the price of bitcoin will keep going up. We think it will get exponentially harder to buy bitcoin, but we will work exponentially more efficiently to buy bitcoin."

For critics who worry that state and media actors embracing bitcoin will undermine its decentralized ideals, Saylor argues the opposite.

"The network is very anti-fragile, and there's a balance of power here," he said. "The more actors that come into the ecosystem, the more diverse, the more distributed the protocol is, the more incorruptible it becomes, the more robust it becomes, and so that means the more trustworthy it becomes to larger economic actors who otherwise would be afraid to put all of their economic weight on the network."

For the first several months of President Donald Trump's second term, DOGE seemed like an unstoppable force. Now, political gravity is about to kick in.

Though he says he'll still be in Washington here and there, Elon Musk is ending his time as an official White House employee. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is preparing to formally ask Congress to begin codifying some of the cuts DOGE has already made — a process that's far from certain to succeed.

It all amounts to a new phase for DOGE, one where the swift and disruptive action of Trump's first few months will give way to the delays, gridlock, and possibility of failure that come with trying to pass bills through Congress.

"The DOGE team has done incredible work," Musk said during a recent appearance at the Qatar Economic Forum. "But the magnitude of the savings is proportionate to the support we get from Congress and from the executive branch of the government in general."

The first task for Republicans is passing $9.4 billion in cuts that the White House plans to send to Congress on Tuesday. That so-called "rescission" package, which rescinds funding previously approved by the legislative branch, includes $8.3 billion in cuts to foreign aid and $1.1 billion in cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the government-backed entity that funds NPR and PBS.

Symbolically, it's a big deal. Republicans have been clamoring to cut federal funding to NPR and PBS for months, and the House DOGE subcommittee held a hearing on the issue in March. There's also been growing frustration on the right that DOGE cuts haven't come sooner, with some lawmakers arguing that they should be regularly voting to codify spending cuts.

"We should have been voting on DOGE cuts every single week," Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia wrote on X on Monday.

Numerically, however, the $9.4 billion package is minuscule. It's less than half of one percent of the $2 trillion that Musk once envisioned cutting, and it's only about 6% of the $160 billion that Musk says DOGE has cut already.

And despite GOP control of both the House and the Senate, it's not guaranteed to pass. All it would take is a handful of Republicans to derail the effort, and when Trump tried to pass a $15 billion recession package in his first term, it failed in the Senate.

There's already at least one GOP senator who's likely to vote against it: Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who recently wrote an op-ed opposing cuts to public broadcasting funding.

A White House official told BI that the $9.4 billion in cuts — only the second time a president has sent a rescission package to Congress since 2000 — is an indication of the administration's commitment to following through on DOGE's work. The official also expressed optimism that the package would pass and that more rescissions would come in the future.

While there may be more rescissions down the line, much of the DOGE cuts are likely to be made in the coming government funding process, which Congress will have to wrap up before funding runs out at the end of September.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said as much in a post on X on Wednesday, adding that the House is "eager and ready to act on DOGE's findings so we can deliver even more cuts to big government."

That will be even harder than passing stand-alone DOGE cuts. While rescission packages only require a simple majority in both chambers to pass, government funding is generally a bipartisan process — one that Democrats have the power to block entirely in the Senate via the 60-vote filibuster rule.

Democrats let a government funding bill pass the Senate in March despite their misgivings about DOGE at the time. That led to intense backlash from the Democratic base, which has helped fuel primary challenges and calls for generational change. It's unclear that enough Democrats will be willing to do the same thing again in September.

Meanwhile, Republicans are making their own job harder with their "Big Beautiful Bill," a sprawling piece of legislation that, in its current form, would increase the deficit by trillions of dollars over the next decade.

Musk made his dissatisfaction with that bill clear in a recent interview, saying it "undermines" the work that DOGE has been doing by increasing the deficit and debt.

"I think a bill can be big, or it could be beautiful," Musk said. 'I don't know if it could be both."

The year's second Grand Slam is underway in France as we head into the third round on the clay courts of Roland-Garros, Paris. We've rounded up everything you need to know about how to watch a French Open live stream, including multiple free options.

Keep reading to learn about viewing options from around the globe. Even seasoned tennis fans should take notice, as some countries have changed channels from last year.

The free options highlighted below will require a VPN to watch from outside their broadcast country, but we can show you how to do this further down the page.

US: TNT/truTV

Notable matches:

Want to access those free options but aren't actually in France or Australia? You can still tune in with the help of a VPN. Short for virtual private networks, VPNs are cybersecurity tools that enable you to change your electronic device's virtual location.

They're popular apps among those looking to access their usual websites and services while traveling abroad or upgrade their online security. ProtonVPN is a great place to start, thanks in no small part to its impressive security features and 30-day money-back guarantee.

This early in the tournament, when there are so many matches on at once, I've found France has the best selection, even getting involved with the doubles coverage. Some Australian coverage is limited to replays, but they'll get more live matches the deeper we get into the competition.


                      Need a low-cost VPN packed with useful features and servers in 110+ countries? Then don't miss these ProtonVPN deals with a sizable 66% discount on a two-year plan at $3.39 a month. If you'd prefer a shorter-term, the one-year plan is great value too and only $3.99 a month. If you only want a rolling one-month deal, Proton is much cheaper than the competition at $9.99. All plans can be used across 10 devices at once and feature a great ad-blocker, split tunneling, and more security-conscious features.
                    

All the items below also have a free streaming option to be unlocked from anywhere with a VPN. Set it to the corresponding country, and you're all set.

Instead of NBC and Peacock, US French Open coverage will air across TNT and truTV this year. American cord-cutters have a few options to explore when tuning in without cable. You can live stream the channels through a live TV streaming service like Sling TV or DirecTV, or try out Max. Select coverage will also be available through the Tennis Channel, but the bulk of the action will be on Warner Bros. properties.

TNT is available through both of Sling TV's base plans, Sling Orange and Blue, which carry anywhere from 35-40+ channels. Sling Orange also carries ESPN, while Sling Blue offers local channels in select regions. Subscriptions start at $46/month, but new users can get 50% off their first month. DirecTV also carries TNT and about 25 other key sports channels in its MySports pack. The package also includes automatic access to ESPN Plus. New users can try out the service for free for five days.


                      DirecTV's MySports pack carries popular sports channels, from mainstays like ESPN to niche offerings like the ACC Network. 
                    


                          For just the essentials without any extra fluff, Sling TV is the streaming service you're looking for. It's more customizable than other plans, with three options you can choose from, so you pay for only what you need. New members often get a chunky discount on their first month.
                        
                      

Max, formerly HBO Max (and soon to be HBO Max again), will live stream French Open matches through its B/R Sports Add-on. This add-on is only available with ad-free plans, which start at $17/month. For more bang for your buck, you can opt for one of the Disney Plus bundles. Ad-free Disney Plus, Hulu, and Max are available for $30/month.

The streaming options also look a bit different for UK viewers this year. Instead of Eurosport, the TNT Sports coverage will be available to live stream through Discovery Plus. The Premium tier, which costs £31/month, is required to watch TNT. This option offers live streaming for several sports, including motorsport, Champions League, and UFC. Other than France and the UK, coverage remains on Eurosport for the rest of Europe.

SINGAPORE — Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth on Saturday warned that the U.S. was prepared to "fight and win" against China if deterrence efforts failed, while urging Asian allies to strengthen military coordination and raise defense spending.

Speaking at the annual defense summit Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, U.S. Defense Secretary Hegseth stressed Washington's resolve to bolster defense capabilities at a time when regional warfare has flared up around the world, including Russia's war in Ukraine and the military conflict in Gaza.

While playing up the U.S.' commitment to the Indo-Pacific region, Hegseth took swipes at the absence of China's defense minister. "We are here this morning. Somebody else isn't," he said.

Hegseth urged political and defense leaders in the audience to act with urgency in pushing back against China's mounting military pressure in the South China Sea and around Taiwan.

"China has demonstrated that it wants to fundamentally alter the region's status quo. We cannot look away and we cannot ignore it. China's behavior toward its neighbors and the world is a wake up call and an urgent one," said Hegseth.

"We ask, and indeed, we insist that our allies and partners do their part on defense," said Hegseth, adding that "our defense spending must reflect the dangers and threats that we face today, because deterrence doesn't come on the cheap."

The sharp rhetoric comes against the backdrop of increasing trade frictions between Washington and Beijing as optimism over a deal following a temporary tariff truce secured earlier this month wanes.

U.S.-China trade talks "are a bit stalled," and would warrant the two countries' heads to weigh in, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News Thursday.

China's activities in the South China Sea undermine sovereignty and threaten freedom of navigation and overflight while its ongoing military operations near Taiwan signal a clear intent to escalate pressure on the island, the Pentagon leader said.

He also vowed to step up security nearer to the U.S., eliminating China's "malign" influence over Panama Canal. "It is key terrain, after all, China did not build that canal. We did, and we will not allow China to weaponize it or control it."

China in March said it was prepared to fight "any type of war" with the U.S., as President Donald Trump ratcheted up economic and political pressure on the country. "If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we're ready to fight till the end," the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. said in a post.

China's Defense Minister Dong Jun was absent from this year's summit — the first time Beijing's top military official has skipped the event since 2019. Beijing instead sent a lower-ranking delegation, led by Major General Hu Gangfeng, Vice President of National Defense University of People's Liberation Army.

Major General Hu is expected to participate in a special session later Saturday on cooperative maritime security in the Asia-Pacific.

The absence of China's top military official has cast doubts over whether there will be a bilateral meeting between Chinese and the U.S. defense officials.

Last year then-U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Dong held a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the security forum, where both sides agreed to maintain military dialogue.

The absence of Beijing's defense minister could be an attempt to avoid engagement and conflict with the U.S. on flashpoints like Taiwan and the South China Sea, experts said.

"Beijing always wants to control the narrative and discourse. Shangri-La does not enable that," said Drew Thompson, senior fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies and a former U.S. official at the Defense Department.

"When I was at DoD, my PLA counterpart once explained to me what they didn't like. He said, 'we don't like being made out to be gladiators fighting one another for others' entertainment. We want to deal with our differences bilaterally, in channels, not in public forums,'" he added.

Beijing sees limited strategic benefits in sending its top defense officials to the annual summit, instead it is focused on deepening ties through alternative forums without U.S. presence, Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, told CNBC earlier this month. That's according to CNBC's translation of his comments in Mandarin.

The U.S. government plans to ramp up weapon sales to Taiwan to a level beyond the $18.3 billion authorized during Trump's first term, surpassing the $8.4 billion approved under President Biden, according to Reuters.

The proposed arms packages will focus on cost-effective systems such as missiles, munitions, and drones, as part of an effort to enhance Taiwan's deterrence capabilities as Beijing ramps up pressure on the democratic island.

The U.S. has been an important ally and arms supplier to Taiwan for decades, with Beijing calling on Washington to halt such actions and stop creating tensions in the Taiwan Strait.

Beijing claims Taiwan as its territory and has vowed to "reunify" with the democratically governed island, by force if necessary. Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims.

For years, China has been steadily ramping up its military pressure to assert its sovereignty claims over Taiwan, regularly sending aircraft and naval vessels near the island.

Dong warned at the Shangri-La Dialogue last year that any forces aimed at separating Taiwan from China would face "self-destruction" and stressed the Taiwan issue as "the core of our core interest."

Concerns have mounted over Trump's commitment to the island too. On the election campaign trail, Trump had suggested Taiwan should pay for U.S. protection and accused it of siphoning off America's semiconductor industry, raising alarm in Taipei.

Global economic tensions and trade policy uncertainties continue to influence cryptocurrency markets as Bitcoin recovers from a recent correction. 

Despite the pullback, institutional interest remains strong with firms like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and GameStop adding BTC to their corporate treasuries.

Crypto World News

June 1, 2025 by Paul Adedoyin 

In the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency, the Ethereum ecosystem is making waves, leading the market with impressive gains. A recent post by Merlin The Trader on X highlights that this ecosystem has seen a 46% increase in value over the past month and a 42% rise since the start of the month.

This strong performance has outpaced other major crypto sectors like Bitcoin, decentralized finance (DeFi), artificial intelligence (AI) tokens, and meme coins, showing that the Ether market is currently the top player in the space.

The data shared in the post comes with a detailed table that breaks down how different crypto sectors are doing. Bitcoin, often seen as the leader of the crypto market, has a fully diluted market cap of over $2.2 trillion but only grew by 11.7% this month.

Ethereum, with a market cap of around $316 billion, far exceeded that with its 46% monthly gain. The smart contract platform sector, which includes Ethereum, grew by just 8.1%, while meme coins and DeFi tokens saw gains of 8.2% and 13.5%, respectively.

AI tokens, another popular category, rose by 14%, but that's still well behind Ether's performance.

Merlin The Trader's post suggests that while many investors might be overlooking Ethereum, smart money (experienced or institutional investors) is rotating into this ecosystem.

This could be due to Ethereum's role as a foundation for many decentralized applications, like those in DeFi or gaming, which rely on its blockchain for secure and transparent transactions. The blockchain's ability to support smart contracts makes it a go-to platform for developers building new projects.

This ecosystem's recent surge highlights that it's not just Bitcoin that can drive the market, other ecosystems can take the lead too. However, the table also shows that crypto can be a rollercoaster, with many sectors experiencing losses over the year.

For example, Ethereum itself is down 21.8% since the start of the year, and DeFi tokens have dropped 44.2% over the same period.

Ethereum is on the spotlight again this week. SharpLink Gaming, a US-based sports betting firm, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer up to $1 billion in common stock.

The company says it plans to use the money to purchase Ether (ETH), the main cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. This big move comes just days after SharpLink announced its new Ethereum-based treasury strategy.

Their stock price exploded by nearly 400% during trading on May 27, just after the plan went public. At the same time, the company appointed Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as the new chairman of its board of directors.

According to the May 30 SEC filing, SharpLink wants to put most of the raised funds toward buying Ether. But it's not just about crypto. Some of the cash will also go toward running the business—things like working capital, corporate expenses, and affiliate marketing operations.

ETH was trading at $2,520 at the time of the filing, down 2.31% in 24 hours, based on Coingecko data. The timing of the purchase, and how much Ether they actually buy, could depend on the market. But the message is clear: SharpLink is going all in on Ethereum.

The company also listed several risks that could affect its big Ether investment. One of them is the possible rise of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). If CBDCs take off, SharpLink believes demand for private cryptocurrencies like ETH could drop or lose their usefulness.



Another risk is regulatory. If the SEC or another agency decides to classify Ether as a “security,” SharpLink could face new rules and reporting requirements. That could complicate their plans and cost the company money in the long run.

The crypto community didn't stay quiet. Many compared SharpLink's move to what Strategy did with Bitcoin.

Crypto analyst 0xBoboShanti posted on X (formerly Twitter), “Ethereum finally has its own Saylor,” referring to Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). His firm now owns over 580,250 BTC, valued at more than $60 billion, based on Saylor Tracker.

Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano added to the noise, saying, “You are not bullish enough,” signaling strong support for SharpLink's strategy.

The timing could be key. Just before SharpLink's filing, ETF provider REX Shares submitted paperwork that has analysts predicting Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs could launch in the US soon.

These ETFs would allow investors to earn staking rewards through regulated funds, something many providers have struggled to pull off.

Brazilian fintech Méliuz (CASH3), which serves over 30 million users in the country, is launching a public share offering to raise up to R$450 million ($78 million), with plans to allocate all proceeds to purchasing bitcoin BTC$104,789.61.

The offering, announced Friday in a securities filing, consists of an initial issuance of 17 million common shares, with the possibility of expanding to 51 million depending on demand. Shares will be sold exclusively to professional investors in Brazil and abroad under automatic registration rules.

Each share purchased will come with a package of free subscription warrants divided into 10 series, allowing investors to buy additional stock at set prices in the future.

At current share prices, Méliuz expects to raise around $26 million, but that figure could triple if overallotment options are exercised.

Investors participating in the offering will also receive 50.6 million warrants, of which up to 152 million will be issued in total under maximum subscription conditions.

Méliuz will use the raised funds to acquire BTC, positioning it as a "primary strategic asset" in its treasury. The firm, known for its cashback and financial services platform, revealed it was allocating 10% of its cash reserves to BTC back in March.

Warrant trading is expected to begin on June 16, with share settlement and crediting of the bonus instruments by June 18. 

The company currently holds 320.2 BTC. Its shares dropped more than 8% in Friday's trading session.

Key Takeaways

Yuga Labs, the cryptocurrency company most famously known for its Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, has sold the Moonbirds NFT intellectual property to Orange Cap Games in a deal that mirrors the company's strategic priorities in evolution. 

The sale, whose financial terms have not been made public, is Yuga's third IP transaction of 2022. Earlier this year, Yuga sold the intellectual property rights for Meebits and CryptoPunks, which represents a significant shift away from diversifying within NFTs.

Originally acquired by Yuga Labs in early 2024 as part of a broader purchase of creator Proof, the Moonbirds IP was once a flagship project within the Ethereum NFT space. 

However, with Yuga now doubling down on its core initiatives, most notably the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem and its metaverse project, the decision to divest seems in tune with a more focused long-term vision.

Orange Cap Games is a new player in the blockchain gaming market, but recently took over the Moonbirds brand. The studio, known for its hybrid approach to physical and digital experiences, just launched its trading card game based on Pudgy Penguins on the Ethereum layer-2 network. 

The acquisition of Moonbirds is a sign of increasing ambition to expand its IP portfolio as well as its presence in the NFT-powered gaming space.

While Orange Cap hasn't explicitly said what it will do with Moonbirds, the brand assets it may create in the future could run on Ethereum's mainnet or ApeChain, Yuga's affiliated layer-2 network. The Moonbirds assets will still be featured in Yuga's Otherside metaverse, so there will be some consistency between the two firms.

Moonbirds, which launched in April 2022 at the height of NFT fever, saw remarkable early sales with over $280 million in transactions in its first weekend. Although Proof had sparked significant early interest and raised a lot of money, the subsequent decline of the NFT market hit its creator hard. 

Community engagement dropped, and momentum fizzled. The 2024 acquisition by Yuga was considered a breath of fresh air for the project, but it has recently passed into new hands again.The Moonbirds sale caps off a big trend of 2025: acquisition or realignment around core assets by the major players. As Yuga Labs shifts its focus back to its core projects, other companies like Orange Cap Games are taking on the challenge of breathing new life into classic NFT brands. 

The brand's resurgence depends on Moonbirds' ability to captivate the audience again, and that will depend on the creative and technical prowess of Orange Cap in this swiftly changing digital world.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says the U.S. should prepare for war, not a bitcoin-driven future.

Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California on Friday, TheStreet reports, Dimon dismissed recent government moves to bolster a national digital asset reserve, arguing that real-world defense logistics, not blockchain assets, should take priority.

“We shouldn't be stockpiling bitcoins,” Dimon said. “We know what we need. It's not a mystery.” He called for the prioritization of “guns, bullets, tanks, planes, drones, and rare earths.”

Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump called for the establishment of a bitcoin reserve and digital assets stockpile. Dimon isn't convinced about it.

“If there's a war in the South China Sea, we've got missiles for seven days,” he warned. “That's not something we should be saying with a straight face.”

Dimon, a well-known crypto critic, revealed earlier this month that JPMorgan will soon allow clients to buy bitcoin.

Strategy CEO Michael Saylor touted Bitcoin as a virtually foolproof path to wealth creation for “everyone”—from business owners to families, and even one's enemies—in his speech at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas this week.

During the roughly 35-minute presentation on Thursday entitled “21 Ways to Wealth,” the famous Bitcoin maxi said the world's oldest cryptocurrency is “perfected capital," championing its “incorruptible… [and] programmable” nature. He urged his audience to buy Bitcoin to enrich themselves. 

“Bitcoin is engineered to outperform everything,” Saylor proclaimed.

Of course, juicing demand for Bitcoin would likely benefit Saylor and Strategy and boost the value of the company's holdings. The firm added billions of dollars in Bitcoin to its corporate treasury this month, bringing its total holdings to 580,250 BTC—worth more than $60 billion as of the time of writing, according to data provider CoinGecko.

Although speaking before Bitcoiners, the executive stressed that his sales pitch was largely for crypto-curious listeners watching via livestream at home, stressing that Bitcoin is “not [just] for multi-billion-dollar companies.”

“It's for everyone,” Saylor claimed. "Take your fiat currency, trade it for Bitcoin. Take your long-term capital, trade it for bitcoin. Sell your bonds, trade [them] for Bitcoin. Sell your inferior equity, sell your inferior real estate property, buy Bitcoin."

The Strategy executive also urged his listeners to embrace AI tools, touting their ability to transform the average person into “100 super-geniuses.”

“I tell all my executives, before you ask a lawyer, before you ask a banker, before you ask any expert, go to the AI,” Saylor said. “Make it think. Grind the silicon overlord.”

Saylor recently shared that Strategy used AI to help craft its unique stock offerings to help power the firm's bountiful Bitcoin buys.

Its Bitcoin acquisition spree has inspired a growing number of firms to stockpile the token, with public companies like Metaplanet, Semler Scientific, and most recently GameStop allocating massive amounts of capital to increase their Bitcoin holdings over the past few months. 

Similarly, institutional investors are also increasingly investing in Bitcoin via exchange-traded funds, pouring billions of dollars into spot Bitcoin ETFs over the past year and a half since their debut in the U.S. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF recorded nearly $6 billion worth of inflows in May once all was said and done, coming close to the monthly record, Farside Investors data shows. 

Investors' growing appetite for Bitcoin has pushed the token's price to new all-time highs. The asset surpassed $109,000 on May 21 before cresting to nearly $112,000 a day later, although its price has since moderated, sitting just above $104,000 as of this writing.

Saylor's speech seemed largely geared towards ensuring Bitcoin would continue its climb to new record highs, bolstered by investments from individuals and institutions across the world. 

The Strategy founder rounded out his speech by eschewing loftier ideas such as “changing the world” or chasing one's passions as “dilutive distractions,” advising his disciples to narrow their focus to buying Bitcoin if they wanted to get rich. Saylor acknowledged the work of pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto in his advice.

“Satoshi gave you an idea worth half of everything on Earth,” Saylor said. “You don't have to topple any particular system that exists in this world… don't fight lost causes.”

TALLINN, Estonia, May  31, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As Phase 5 of its limited presale nears completion, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is gaining momentum for all the right reasons. With its innovative Nova App poised for launch and over $1.2 million raised from 11,000+ participants, the project signals a shift away from short-term hype and toward sustainable, long-term value creation.Bitcoin Solaris: Mining Reimagined for Real People

In a world where mining has become elite, expensive, and inaccessible to most, Bitcoin Solaris is changing everything.

At the core is the Solaris Nova App—a revolutionary, mobile-first platform designed to make crypto mining available to everyone, regardless of budget, location, or experience.

Don't Miss This Early BTC-S Opportunity

With this app, users can:

 

There's no complex setup. No bulky rigs. No tech barriers.

Bitcoin Solaris uses a hybrid Proof-of-Work + Delegated Proof-of-Stake model that processes up to 10,000 transactions per second, with finality in 2 seconds, and uses 99.95% less energy than traditional mining chains.

This isn't just mining made easier. This is mining made for the modern world—and it's the foundation for true, lasting crypto growth.

Final Hours of Phase 5: A Critical Entry Point

The presale, which ends on July 31, 2025, is entering a key transition. With less than 30 hours before Phase 5 ends, token pricing will move from $5 to $6, continuing toward a public launch price of $20. Investors in this window also receive an 11% token bonus, maximizing early participation benefits before broader exposure.

Key Presale Details:

Unlike speculative offerings, Bitcoin Solaris ties its presale directly to the rollout of functional technology. The Nova App—currently in limited beta—is nearing full release, making early access a strategic opportunity rather than a speculative gamble.Why Influencers Are Lining Up to Support It

 

Bitcoin Solaris hasn't just caught the eyes of early users—it's earning praise from trusted voices in the crypto space. Here's what they're saying:

This isn't just a flash of attention—it's real validation from those who've seen dozens of projects rise and fall.

Built for the Long Game, Not the Hype Game

Bitcoin Solaris isn't about hype. It's about results.

The team is shipping products, delivering milestones, and building around feedback. The Nova App is nearly ready for full release. The blockchain architecture is proven. Security is confirmed through a full Freshcoins audit and KYC verification. And the user base is growing by the hour.

This is how long-term appreciation begins—by solving real problems and giving people real tools.

Conclusion: A Technology-First Approach to Crypto Growth

Crypto bubbles are temporary. But platforms built on utility, accessibility, and clear economic models are built to last. Bitcoin Solaris offers more than speculation—it offers a system designed for stability, scale, and real user value. 

As Phase 5 closes, the window to join at the $5 price point is closing fast. For those seeking a grounded entry into the next era of blockchain mining and crypto income, Bitcoin Solaris is open now—and built for the long game.

Make the move. Build the future.

 IMF questions Pakistan's plan to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining amid energy shortages and budget talks. 

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised concerns over Pakistan's decision to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence data centers amid ongoing negotiations tied to the country's extended financial program.

The initiative, announced last week, is designed to attract autonomous miners, blockchain companies, and AI firms to Pakistan.

However, the IMF has raised red flags about the move, requesting urgent clarification from the Finance Ministry regarding the legality of crypto mining and the power allocations, particularly as the nation struggles with chronic energy shortages and fiscal pressures, according to a report by local news outlets Samaa.

Per the report, the IMF was not consulted prior to the announcement and is questioning the legal standing of cryptocurrencies in Pakistan. The Fund has also voiced concerns over potential impacts on power tariffs and resource distribution.

“There is a fear of further tough talks from the IMF on this initiative,” an official involved in the ongoing negotiations reportedly said. “The economic team is already facing stiff questions, and this move has only added to the complexities of the talks.”

The IMF delegation, currently conducting virtual discussions with Pakistani officials, is expected to schedule a separate session dedicated to the government's electricity plan for Bitcoin (BTC) mining and AI operations.

The electricity allocation is part of a wider national strategy to integrate digital assets into Pakistan's economy. A key component of this plan is the establishment of the Pakistan Digital Asset Authority (PDAA), approved by the Finance Ministry on May 21.

The PDAA will regulate exchanges, wallets, stablecoins, and DeFi platforms while overseeing the tokenization of national assets in line with international frameworks such as those of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

The development follows Pakistan's high-profile debut of its first strategic Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin Vegas 2025 conference last week — an event signaling Islamabad's pivot toward digital finance.

During the conference, Bilal bin Saqib, crypto adviser to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, announced the launch of a national Bitcoin wallet and the government's commitment to support the digital asset sector.

Pakistan signals new approach to crypto sector

Pakistan's government began shifting its stance on cryptocurrencies earlier this year with the proposal of a “National Crypto Council” in February 2025.

The body was tasked with drafting a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets and attracting foreign investment to the country's growing crypto ecosystem.

Among the Council's early proposals were plans to utilize surplus energy for Bitcoin mining and data center operations, as well as building a national Bitcoin reserve.

Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao was also appointed as an adviser to the Council in April. In this role, he is expected to provide guidance on crypto regulations, blockchain infrastructure, and digital asset adoption.

Bitcoin prices fell below $104,000, leading to over $600 million in liquidations, marking the highest losses since February.

U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff increase on Chinese steel and aluminum has rattled global trade markets, affecting crypto markets.

The broader crypto market experienced a sell-off, with major cryptocurrencies like Ether, XRP, and Solana dropping significantly.

Crypto markets saw a wave of liquidations in the past 24 hours as bitcoin (BTC) prices slipped under $104,000, triggering over $600 million in forced closures of bullish futures positions to mark the highest losses since February.



A total of $688 million in liquidations hit traders, with 89% of them on the long side — reflecting a heavily bullish market. The largest single liquidation order was a $12.25 million BTC/USDT on OKX, Coinglass data shows.Bitcoin-tracked futures led losses at over $153 mmillion, followed by Ethereum (ETH) at around $122 million. Solana (SOL) faced liquidations totaling about $33 million, XRP futures at $30 million, and Dogecoin (DOGE) futures at over $22 million.



"Markets went red on Friday on renewed tariff-related apprehensions," said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, in an email to CoinDesk.



U.S. President Donald Trump accused China of violating a bilateral trade deal, prompting him to double tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50% to protect domestic industries. He claimed China reneged on a May agreement to ease trade tensions, adding that he might discuss the matter with President Xi.



While China is a top steel exporter, most of its steel is already subject to existing tariffs, per Reuters. Trump's move rattled global trade markets, with potential implications for key minerals and overall relations between the two nations.



The broader crypto market was also swept by the sell-off, with Ether down nearly 4%, XRP and Solana falling around 4-5%, and Dogecoin diving over 8% on the day.



Data from Deribit shows open interest in Bitcoin futures has surged 51% since April, with options up 126%, signaling increasing investor appetite for leverage. But whales — large holders with more than 10,000 BTC — have shifted from accumulation to net selling, sending coins back to exchanges in a classic sign of profit-taking.



A cascade of liquidations often indicates market extremes, where a price reversal could be imminent as market sentiment overshoots in one direction. Still, the renewed tariff flare-up, combined with a jittery derivatives market, has traders bracing for more volatility ahead.

Trading in the mid-$2,000 range, Ethereum (ETH) has repeatedly teased a move toward $3,000, only to fall short and retreat back into its current range. However, several crypto analysts remain confident that ETH's ascent to $3,000 and beyond is only a matter of time.

In a recent X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted ETH's bullish price action. The analyst shared the following daily ETH chart, showing the cryptocurrency breaking out of a bullish flag following a period of consolidation – potentially setting its sights on a target of $3,800.

Fellow crypto analyst Master of Crypto shared Titan's outlook, saying that ETH is “holding up really well right now.” In a separate X post, the analyst added:

It looks like a breakout is coming, and $3K is just around the corner. The fact that it's outperforming #BTC this quarter is a strong sign that altcoin season is warming up.

Meanwhile, crypto trader Jelle urged patience. Sharing the following chart of ETH's recent price movement, he emphasized that ETH is behaving as expected as it continues to challenge a key resistance level. According to Jelle, the “real fun” will begin once ETH hits $3,000.

Notably, ETH continues to attract strong institutional interest. Exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows for Ethereum topped $91 million yesterday, with BlackRock alone accounting for $50.4 million of that total – a clear sign of sustained confidence in the digital asset.

Seasoned analyst Ali Martinez also highlighted significant whale accumulation. According to Martinez, wallets holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 ETH acquired over 1 million ETH in the last 48 hours – a strong signal of long-term bullish sentiment.

Large ETH ETF inflows and whale purchases signal rising institutional confidence and aggressive accumulation – trends that often precede bullish price action. By reducing the available supply on the market, these moves can help fuel upward momentum and price appreciation.

From a technical standpoint, Ethereum is showing encouraging signs. Crypto trader Merlijn The Trader pointed out that ETH appears to be closely following the Wyckoff Accumulation pattern.

In this pattern, the spring phase involves a false breakdown below support to shake out weak hands, followed by a test to confirm waning selling pressure. This sets the stage for the jump – a strong rally above resistance with significant volume, marking the start of a new uptrend.

According to Merlijn, ETH has already completed the spring and test phases and is now poised to enter the jump phase – potentially setting the stage for a move toward a new all-time high (ATH).

That said, all eyes are on the FTX creditor payouts expected later today. Experts warn that the massive $5 billion distribution could temporarily dampen ETH's bullish momentum by increasing short-term selling pressure. At press time, ETH trades at $2,603, down 2.4% in the past 24 hours.

Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), has almost doubled in price since bottoming out in April at around $1,385. But while price action appears stable on the surface, onchain data from Binance suggests mounting downside pressure.

Several key metrics, as highlighted by CryptoQuant-based onchain analyst BorisVest, are flashing signs of distribution and potential capitulation risk. Let's examine.

One of the clearest warning signs is the sustained rise in Ethereum reserves on Binance.

Since December, ETH reserves have increased from around 3.78 million to over 4.21 million, marking a seven-month high. This trend typically signals growing sell-side interest, as large holders transfer coins to exchanges in preparation to liquidate.

When traders anticipate a bullish continuation, they tend to withdraw ETH to self-custody or stake. Conversely, surging exchange reserves imply a readiness to sell, particularly when price rallies coincide with inflows.

It shows that traders are opting to capitalize on local highs, suggesting they do not expect a breakout above the $2,700 resistance to hold.

The exchange netflow chart further confirms this bearish shift.

Over just three trading sessions, Binance has received a combined net inflow of more than 346,000 ETH. This occurred precisely as ETH attempted to rally toward the upper end of its current range.

Netflow measures the difference between ETH deposits and withdrawals from an exchange. Positive values reflect net deposits—typically associated with increased selling pressure—while negative values suggest accumulation.

These large daily inflows, paired with a lack of significant price follow-through, indicate that whales used the recent bounce as an exit. The lack of upward continuation reinforces that demand was insufficient to absorb the supply.

The Ethereum Exchange Supply Ratio—which tracks the share of ETH's total supply held on Binance—also rose during the recent rally. As of late May, the ratio climbed back toward 0.034, up from near-yearly lows in March.

This indicator adds another layer to the bearish picture. More supply moving onto exchanges means greater potential sell pressure in the near term. As this ratio increases while price consolidates or trends higher, it suggests that sellers are becoming more active than buyers.

The alignment of a rising supply ratio with increasing reserves and net inflows strongly implies a coordinated distribution phase. Bulls may interpret stability as strength, but the underlying metrics contradict that view.

Finally, the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio reveals a critical dynamic: while ETH saw aggressive market buying during its most recent bounce, it failed to generate momentum. The ratio jumped above 1.0 on several days in late May, signaling that buyers were initiating trades at market price.

Ordinarily, such taker activity is bullish—it reflects conviction and urgency from buyers. However, when a surge in market buys fails to push the price higher, it suggests that sellers are using the demand as exit liquidity.

In essence, the rally created the illusion of strength, while whales and institutional traders sold into it. This absorption of buying power without upside follow-through typically precedes a breakdown, especially when confirmed by rising exchange reserves and netflows.

Ethereum has formed a clear inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart, pointing to a potential breakout toward $4,150 if the neckline at $2,700 is breached. The structure, coupled with a recent golden cross, suggests bullish momentum could build—if confirmed.

ETH continues to face rejection near the neckline, and volume remains weak. The relative strength index (RSI) is correcting after breaching the overbought threshold of 70. At 56, it shows room for further downside.

A decisive close above $2,700 is needed to validate the breakout. Failure to do so risks a drop toward $2,300 or lower, invalidating the bullish setup.

Ethereum is testing a critical resistance confluence near $2,530, formed by a flipped multi-year ascending trendline, the upper boundary of a descending wedge, and the 0.382 Fib level. So far, ETH has failed to break above this zone.

Adding pressure is the 50-week EMA near $2,575, which ETH has not decisively closed above. This keeps the broader trend bearish.

A rejection from this confluence could trigger a drop to the wedge's lower boundary near $1,975, with extended downside toward the 0.0 Fib level at $1,075. The risk of breakdown remains high unless ETH reclaims $2,575 with strong volume.

 US government argues Coinbase user James Harper has no right to block IRS access to his crypto records in Supreme Court filing. 

The US government has urged the Supreme Court not to take up a Coinbase user's challenge against the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) effort to obtain his crypto transaction records.

In a filing dated May 30, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that Coinbase user James Harper has no Fourth Amendment right to shield his financial records held by the exchange.

The government claimed that Harper “voluntarily” shared his data with Coinbase, and that the IRS followed proper legal procedures to obtain it through a judicially approved summons.

Harper's case centers on a 2016 IRS investigation into widespread tax underreporting on cryptocurrency gains. At the time, the IRS discovered a sharp gap between the millions of Coinbase users trading Bitcoin (BTC) and the relatively few taxpayers who reported crypto gains.

In response, the agency obtained a so-called “John Doe” summons compelling Coinbase to turn over records on high-volume customers.

Harper, who traded Bitcoin on Coinbase during the relevant years, later sued, claiming that the IRS's actions amounted to an unconstitutional search of his personal records.

Lower courts disagreed, ruling that Coinbase's records are business documents — not Harper's private papers — and that the IRS acted lawfully.

In its brief, the government argued that Supreme Court precedent supports the IRS's position. Citing past cases such as United States v. Miller, the government emphasized that individuals have no reasonable expectation of privacy in financial records held by third parties Coinbase.

The filing also pointed to Coinbase's own privacy policy, which warned users that information could be shared with law enforcement.

“To the extent petitioner made those arguments below, the court of appeals correctly rejected them as both foreclosed by this Court's precedent and meritless,” the government said.

The Supreme Court has not yet decided whether it will hear the case. A denial would leave in place the First Circuit's ruling in favor of the IRS.

On May 15, Coinbase disclosed a data breach in which attackers bribed customer support staff in India to access sensitive user information.

Stolen data included customer names, account balances, and transaction histories. Coinbase confirmed the breach impacted roughly 1% of its monthly transacting users. Among those affected was venture capitalist Roelof Botha, managing partner at Sequoia Capital.

Coinbase also faced a wave of lawsuits following the revelation. At least six legal complaints were filed on May 15 and 16, with plaintiffs accusing the exchange of failing to implement adequate security measures and mishandling its response to the breach.

“There is a critical need to align innovation with regulation in the country's evolving crypto landscape. “

This was what Atty. Paolo Ong, the assistant director of the PhiliFintech Innovation Office at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Philippines, stressed during his keynote at Crypto Vision Conference 2025 (CVCPH2025).

Ong's central message in his address is about how legal clarity and compliance can foster innovation and long-term growth in the digital asset industry. 

He then shared the timeline of the soon-to-be-implemented Crypto Assets Service Providers in the Philippines (CASP), a regulatory framework for entities offering crypto-related services by the regulator. 

According to the CVCPH2025 organizers, Ong presented how compliance and innovation can work together for long-term growth.

The CVCPH2025 is a yearly event by growth marketing campaign service provider and blockchain-focused transformative learning platform Museigen.io.

Museigen.io co-founder Fermin Barrenechea III opened the conference with a keynote presentation, encouraging attendees to evolve with technology rather than be left behind. 

He also introduced new concepts such as “Sleep-to-Earn,” “Learn-to-Earn,” and “Retail Therapy” as emerging trends in the post-Play-to-Earn era. 

Apart from these talks, the event also featured panel discussions, other keynotes, live demos, and over ₱1 million in prizes.

In a statement, Museigen.io shared that hundreds of blockchain professionals, investors, developers, and enthusiasts gathered at the AIM Conference Center for the event, a full-day event aiming to spotlight the growing web3 and crypto ecosystem in the Philippines.

Attendees also participated in games, booth passport activities, and received giveaways, including color-coded wristbands for streamlined networking and welcome leis for speakers. 

There are also sponsor booths from GCash, Coins.ph, BitMEX, and others providing demos, freebies, and interactive experiences throughout the venue.

Coins.ph Business Development Director Ralph Idio delivered a keynote on how stablecoins are reshaping remittances. He shared how stablecoins make remittances faster and more cost-efficient.

GCash's Head of Crypto Luis Buenaventura shared how he financed a Tesla using $BTC as collateral. He  highlighted the utility of crypto-backed lending.

CryptoBilis' Frank Andes and Al Yap provided essential wallet protection strategies and real-world cybersecurity lessons for digital asset holders.

Moderated by OpenGuild's Patricia Arro, the first panel featured Jen Bilango (Coins.ph), Robert Joseph Dela Cruz (UnionBank), and Mench Dizon (YGG Pilipinas), who discussed how DeFi and traditional finance can collaborate to create more inclusive financial systems.

Gail Macapagal (Women in Blockchain Philippines) led a session on artificial intelligence with BayaniChain's Paul Soliman, DvCode's Eliezer Rabadon, and Block Tides' Myrtle Ramos, exploring both the benefits and challenges AI brings to the tech and blockchain landscape.

MJ Aguilar moderated the closing panel featuring KC Montero (Kumu), Aldrin Rabino (Crypto4chun), James Genove (The Resistance Trader), and Miguel Avila (Impact Web3), who explored the intersection of gaming, personal values, and web3 technology.

Last year, Crypto Vision Conference 2024 was held on January 27 in Makati Citiy, which brought together crypto enthusiasts, industry leaders, and professionals for an evening of expert insights and networking focused on the evolving cryptocurrency market. 

Attendees gained a clearer outlook on the 2024 crypto landscape through in-depth discussions, while also enjoying raffle prizes, giveaways, and valuable networking opportunities, according to Museigen. 

In addition to Crypto Vision Conference, Museigen.io also conducts in-real-life gatherings for Bitbulaga. It is a webcast session designed for Filipinos interested in blockchain, cryptocurrency, and web3, featuring discussions with industry experts like Luis Buenaventura, Gilbert Lazaro, and Aldrin Rabino. Bitbulaga covers topics such as crypto trading, decentralized finance, and emerging tech trends.

Bitcoin's recent upward trajectory has encountered resistance after reaching a record-breaking peak of over $111,000 last week. Following this new all-time high, Bitcoin has retraced approximately 4% in the past seven days, bringing its current trading price down to $105,485.

This represents a daily decline of 1.8%, reflecting cautious market sentiment and potential profit-taking among traders. In light of these recent price movements, a CryptoQuant analyst has been closely observing market dynamics, particularly concerning the launch of the Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).

A detailed analysis provided by Joao Wedson, a contributor to CryptoQuant's QuickTake platform, has shed new light on the liquidation trends observed in Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies, also known as altcoins.

Liquidation Disparity Between Bitcoin and Altcoins

Since the launch of the Bitcoin ETF, market behaviors have demonstrated a notable divergence between Bitcoin and altcoin liquidations. According to Wedson, Bitcoin liquidations on Binance have predominantly involved short positions, indicating traders who bet against Bitcoin were systematically liquidated during its recent price rise.

Specifically, the Cumulative Liquidation Delta (CLD) showed short liquidations surpassing longs by approximately $190 million. This suggests market participants holding bearish positions were compelled to exit as Bitcoin's value surged, pushing the price further upward.

In stark contrast, altcoins have experienced a markedly different scenario. During the same period, altcoins faced nearly $1 billion more in long liquidations compared to shorts.

This liquidation imbalance indicates that traders betting on a broad altcoin recovery faced substantial losses. The sustained downward pressure on altcoins reveals the failure of expectations surrounding an “Altseason,” a period when alternative cryptocurrencies typically outperform BTC.

Implications of Market Asymmetry

The distinct patterns in liquidations between BTC and altcoins reflect critical shifts in investor risk sentiment and leverage usage. BTC's favorable price performance primarily impacted traders with bearish outlooks, forcing the liquidation of short positions and contributing to a bullish market perception.

Conversely, the altcoin sector's persistent price declines have led to widespread liquidation of bullish positions, highlighting the misalignment between trader expectations and actual market behavior.

According to Wedson, since December 2024, this liquidation asymmetry has widened considerably, underscoring a shift in market focus. Investors have increasingly viewed BTC as a safer or more reliable bet amidst broader market uncertainty, while altcoins have suffered due to heightened leverage and speculative positioning.

This trend has intensified following the ETF's approval, as traders appear more confident betting on Bitcoin's stability and growth potential compared to the volatility and unpredictability of the altcoin market.

Moving forward, the current market conditions suggest that investors may continue to approach Bitcoin with measured optimism while maintaining a cautious stance toward altcoins.

The United States should stockpile guns, ammunition and drones instead of bitcoin, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Friday at the inaugural Reagan National Economic Forum in California. 

“We shouldn't be stockpiling bitcoins,” Dimon said when asked about how industrial policy is entwined with national security policies during a panel.

“We should stockpiling guns, bullets, tanks, planes, drones, you know, rare earths. We know we need to do it. It's not a mystery.” 

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates outside of banking or government authority.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March establishing a Bitcoin reserve, which he described as “a virtual Fort Knox for digital gold.” 

“We should be stockpiling bullets,” he continued.

“Like, you know, the military guys tell you that, you know, if there's a war in the South China Sea, we have missiles for seven days. Okay, come on. I mean, we can't say that with a straight face and think that's okay. So we know what to do. We just got to now go about doing it. Get the people together, roll up our sleeves, you know, have the debates.” 

Dimon joined a fireside chat during the Reagan National Economic Forum in Simi Valley, California, at the Reagan Presidential Library Friday for a sweeping discussion on the economy and how the world's “tectonic plates are shifting” in geopolitics in the form of wars, proxy terrorists and the potential proliferation of nuclear weapons.

Dimon underscored during his address that he does not view China as America's top adversary, and instead pointed his attention to the “enemy within” that could lead to the U.S.' status as the world's leader crater. 

“I'm not as worried about China,” Dimon said. 

“China is a potential adversary. They're doing a lot of things well, they have a lot of problems. But what I really worry about is us. Can we get our own act together, our own values, our own capability, our own management?”

“I always get asked this question: Are we going to be the reserve currency?” he said. 

“No. You know, if we are not the preeminent military and the preeminent economy in 40 years, we will not be the reserve currency. That's a fact. Just read history.” 

He referred to the U.S. government as a “Leviathan” that is too weak to carry out policies, while simultaneously imposing “things on the American public that they're getting sick of.” 

Dimon argued that instead, the U.S. needs to celebrate its long-held values.

“Celebrate our virtues: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of enterprise, equal opportunity, family, God, country,” he said. 

“You know, and you can acknowledge the flaws that we have, which are extraordinary — what we did the Black population for years. Don't denigrate the great things of this country, because those are two different things.”

“We don't talk that much to each other — deal with our policies — this is the enemy within,” he continued.

“We've got to fix our permitting our regulations our immigration our taxation, which I, I think they're on their way. We have to fix our inner city schools, our health care system.” 

The Reagan National Economic forum kicked off Friday, and includes panels featuring Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, lawmakers such as Sens. Mike Rounds and Bill Cassidy, and leaders from the private sector, such as the CEO of Booz Allen Hamilton, Horacio Rozanski. 

The bipartisan event works to promote “President Reagan's enduring belief in the power of the free market and individual opportunity to drive national prosperity,” according to forum organizers.

$83 billion has just been sitting there underground this whole time.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A deposit of gold ore recently discovered in China isn't just giant. It's supergiant. So much so, in fact, that Chinese experts claim it could be the largest deposit of any precious metal—not just gold ore—in existence today. 

How big is the “supergiant” deposit located under the Wangu gold field in the Hunan province? Experts estimate it at 1,100 tons. 

According to Chinese state media, a team of geologists detected over 40 gold veins of roughly 330 tons of gold ore dipping 6,600 feet deep under Pingjiang County's Wangu gold field. But 3D modeling blows that number out of the water, showing there could be as much as 1,100 tons as deep as 9,800 feet. If the models are accurate, the deposit in its entirely could be worth roughly $83 billion. 

Adding some more heft to the already weighty (literally) find was the report that the new discovery features 138 grams of gold per metric ton of ore, a valuable rate not often found in gold mining. “Many drilled rock cores showed visible gold,” said Chen Rulin, an ore-prospecting expert at China's Hunan Province's Geological Bureau, according to Chinese state media. 

If the 1,100-ton figure holds up, that makes this new find the largest gold mine in the world, even outpacing South Africa's South Deep gold mine with its 1,025 tons of gold, according to Mining Technology. Mines in Indonesia, Russia, New Guinea, and Chile round out the top-five gold mines in the world. The Carlin Trend and Cortez gold mines, both in Nevada, are ranked sixth and 10th worldwide. 

Historically, the world has mined 233,000 tons of gold, all of it still around in some form, and two-thirds of that mining has occurred since 1950. 

Already the world's top gold producer with about 10 percent of global production, China is heavily dependent on the metal, using about three times more gold than it mines annually. A rate that high requires the country to purchase so much gold from other countries that it's also the world's top importer of the valuable metal. This new discovery has put the world's gold markets on notice, enough so that the price of gold rose to $2,700 per ounce, according to CCN.com. 

And the gold news may not stop there. According to Liu Yongjun, vice head of the bureau, additional gold ore was found when drilling around the site's peripheral areas.

A pilot study from Michigan Medicine researchers found that the Mediterranean diet may provide symptom relief for people with irritable bowel syndrome.

Study participants were randomized into two groups, one following the Mediterranean diet and the other following the low FODMAP diet, a common restrictive diet for IBS.

In the Mediterranean diet group, 73% of the patients met the primary endpoint for symptom improvement, versus 81.8% in the low FODMAP group.

Irritable bowel syndrome affects an estimated 4-11% of all people, and a majority of patients prefer dietary interventions to medication.

The low FODMAP diet leads to symptom improvement in more than half of patients, but is restrictive and hard to follow.

Previous investigations from Michigan Medicine researchers into more accessible alternative diets led to a proposed "FODMAP simple," which attempted to only restrict the food groups in the FODMAP acronym that are most likely to cause symptoms.

"Restrictive diets, such as low FODMAP, can be difficult for patients to adopt," said Prashant Singh, MBBS, Michigan Medicine gastroenterologist and lead author on the paper.

"In addition to the issue of being costly and time-consuming, there are concerns about nutrient deficiencies and disordered eating when trying a low FODMAP diet. The Mediterranean diet interested us as an alternative that is not an elimination diet and overcomes several of these limitations related to a low FODMAP diet."

The Mediterranean diet is already popular among physicians for its benefits to cardiovascular, cognitive, and general health. Previous research on the effect of the Mediterranean diet on IBS, however, had yielded conflicting results.

In this pilot study, two groups of patients were provided with either a Mediterranean diet or the restriction phase of a low FODMAP diet for four weeks.

The primary endpoint was an FDA-standard 30% reduction in abdominal pain intensity after four weeks.

All the patients included in the study were diagnosed with either IBS-D (diarrhea) or IBS-M (mixed symptoms of constipation or diarrhea).

This study was the first randomized controlled trial to compare the Mediterranean diet to another potential diet. (Previous studies had compared the Mediterranean diet to the individuals' typical diets or were not randomized controlled trials.)

While the Mediterranean diet did provide symptom relief, the low FODMAP group experienced a greater improvement measured by both abdominal pain intensity and IBS symptom severity score.

Researchers found the results of this pilot study -- which 20 patients completed -- sufficiently encouraging to warrant future, larger controlled trials to investigate the potential of the Mediterranean diet as an effective intervention for patients with IBS.

"This study adds to a growing body of evidence which suggests that a Mediterranean diet might be a useful addition to the menu of evidence-based dietary interventions for patients with IBS," said William Chey, M.D., chief of Gastroenterology at the University of Michigan, president-elect of the American College of Gastroenterology, and senior author on the paper.

The researchers believe studies comparing long-term efficacy of the Mediterranean diet with long-term outcomes following the reintroduction and personalization phases of low FODMAP are needed.

Working within the limitations of their 3D printer's bed size is both a challenge and part of the norm for many makers. However, Ivan Miranda and John from Proper Printing have created an infinite print bed by turning a treadmill into a working, giant 3D printer. Their creation can print things on a massive scale, and we absolutely love it.

According to Miranda, he had plans to transform a treadmill into a 3D printer for a while. His friend John had the same idea, and the two quickly got to work on turning their crazy concept into a tangible reality. The result is this impressive 3D printer that works unlike anything we've ever seen.

The 3D printer is a belt printer with all sorts of unique design quirks necessary for a creative project like this. The extruder operates at an angle because it is installed on the treadmill handles. The treadmill belt acts as the print bed and can move prints away from the extruder as they continue. This makes printing massive things with a theoretically infinite bed size possible.

The prints detach easily from the bed as they pull away from the extruder, thanks to the way they curl under the machine once they reach the edge. Plans are in the works to test the limits of their creation, but so far, we're already impressed. Everything from the hardware assembly to the slicing methodology had to be developed from scratch for the project.

Miranda uploaded a video demonstrating the printer in action. In it, we see the treadmill 3D printer print a 2-meter-long I-beam. This impressive feat took approximately 36 hours to complete, which isn't too bad. The team intends to take things a step further by using the setup to 3D print a kayak.

Creating your 3D printer is cool, but there's nothing wrong with buying one to get started. If you're new to 3D printing or want to see what's currently leading the market, check out our list of the best 3D printers to see which ones we recommend.

Leaked photos raise questions over unauthorized distribution and cooling feasibility.

A blower-style version of the RTX 5090 GPU has emerged online courtesy of hardware leaker Olrak20_ on X (formerly Twitter). The photos, which seem to be from a facility in China, show multiple units of the GPU packed in boxes and ready for shipment. Curiously, the GPU has a serial number sticker which mentions ‘RTX5090 32G D7 Turbo', suggesting that the GPU in question is not the RTX 5090D, officially meant for the Chinese market.

To date, Nvidia partners have not announced any blower-style variant of the RTX 5090. A blower-style GPU includes a single fan to draw in air, and hot air is exhausted from the back of the case. This makes it suitable for systems with limited space and servers, workstations, or multi-GPU setups where managing internal heat is important. Unlike open-air cooled GPUs that tend to recirculate warm air inside the case, blower cards can help lower ambient temperatures by removing all the hot air.

Last month, a similar-looking blower-style RTX 5090D was spotted on Chinese video platform Bilibili. It featured a two-slot design, a rear-mounted 16-pin power connector, and a large open section at the bottom. The video also validated that it included the GB202 chip paired with 32 GB of GDDR7 VRAM. This new leak, however, feels less official and more like an opportunistic offshoot.



The RTX 5090 can draw up to 575W of power, which means a blower cooler may struggle to handle such high thermal output levels without throttling or excessive noise. While that raises doubts about the card's thermal capability, there's a chance that these GPUs are meant for an AI (Artificial Intelligence) training or an enterprise setup.

It is also important to note that the GPU and the boxes do not have branding, which further suggests that they might be gray-market or unauthorized units that originated through unofficial or illicit channels. Recently, the U.S. government requested that the Malaysian trade minister tighten security and monitor tech exports to China to crack down on chip smugglers.



Nvidia has not commented on the images or confirmed any such SKU in development. Until the company or a board partner offers a statement, the origin and legitimacy of these blower-style RTX 5090 units remain unclear. Whether they are engineering samples, modified OEM hardware, or originating from unauthorized supply chains, the appearance of such GPUs raises doubts over supply chain security and the growing demand for high-performance GPUs in China.

Last week, Google quietly released an app that lets users run a range of openly available AI models from the AI dev platform Hugging Face on their phones. 

Called Google AI Edge Gallery, the app is available for Android and will soon come to iOS. It allows users to find, download, and run compatible models that generate images, answer questions, write and edit code, and more. The models run offline, without needing an internet connection, tapping into supported phones' processors.

AI models running in the cloud are often more powerful than their local counterparts, but they also have their downsides. Some users might be wary of sending personal or sensitive data to a remote data center, or want to have models available without needing to find a Wi-Fi or cellular connection. 

Google AI Edge Gallery, which Google is calling an “experimental Alpha release,” can be downloaded from GitHub by following these instructions. The home screen shows shortcuts to AI tasks and capabilities like “Ask Image” and “AI Chat.” Tapping on a capability pulls up a list of models suited for the task, such as Google's Gemma 3n.  

Google AI Edge Gallery also provides a “Prompt Lab” users can use to kick off “single-turn” tasks powered by models, like summarizing and rewriting text. The Prompt Lab comes with several task templates and configurable settings to fine-tune the models' behaviors. 

Your mileage may vary in terms of performance, Google warns. Modern devices with more powerful hardware will predictably run models faster, but the model size also matters. Larger models will take more time to complete a task — say, answering a question about an image — than smaller models. 

Google's inviting members of the developer community to give feedback on the Google AI Edge Gallery experience. The app is under an Apache 2.0 license, meaning it can be used in most contexts — commercial or otherwise — without restriction.

Will we get a better gaming experience the second time around?

If we are to believe a leaked manual for an upcoming Intel W880 motherboard, the Intel Arrow Lake-S processor will seemingly have a refresh successor. Popular hardware leaker momomo_us shared an image of the purported motherboard reference document with the CPU labeled Arrow Lake S/Arrow Lake S Refresh.

Previous rumors point to another generation of the Arrow Lake architecture, focusing only on high-end K and KF chips. So, it would make sense for motherboards designed for high-end workstations to take advantage of this refresh. Unfortunately, we do not see any other information on the document, so we will have to wait and see if manufacturers of more mainstream consumer and enthusiast motherboards will release new models for this alleged Arrow Lake update.

The Intel Core Ultra 200S series arrived on the scene in October 2024, around two months after the company released its disastrous financial report. Team Blue sorely needed a win to help it get back on course—unfortunately, the Arrow Lake wasn't it, as sales for its latest processor stagnated just a week after its launch. After half a year on the market, the company still struggles to sell its AI chips, with many customers preferring the older Raptor Lake CPUs.

One reason behind this could be the chip's lack of gaming prowess. It has consistently trailed behind AMD's outstanding offerings, especially the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, and was even outperformed by Intel's own last-generation chips. And even though the Arrow Lake processors boast an NPU and offer higher AI processing power, most buyers don't care about that. This, combined with the higher prices, meant that there was low demand for these CPUs.

If the Arrow Lake-S Refresh chips are indeed arriving, Intel must address the gaming performance issues. Otherwise, buyers would shun them and instead flock towards options that deliver more FPS and do not bottleneck other components.

Despite all the negativity in the gaming space for the Arrow Lake-S chips, Intel has made some interesting innovations in the processor. It has improved power consumption and efficiency, reducing its cooling requirements. It's also a productivity powerhouse, with the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K beating most of its competitors in Cinebench.

This was the first Intel desktop CPU to use a chiplet-based design, so it's bound to have first-generation hiccups. Hopefully, the company can fix some of the concerns with the refresh, allowing us to get the most out of the Arrow Lake architecture.

Meta recently released a new video editing app for creators called Edits. The new app is designed to rival ByteDance's CapCut, a popular short-form video-editing app used by many creators. 

Meta first shared that it was working on Edits back in January after ByteDance-owned CapCut was removed from U.S. app stores when the TikTok ban momentarily went into effect. Although the app has since come back online and is available to download, TikTok's future in the U.S. remains uncertain, so Meta is ready to capitalize on CapCut's possible absence in the future with its new Edits app.

We've created this guide to walk you through the app and the different features it offers, and we provide an overview of how it compares to CapCut. 

Edits is available to download on both iOS and Android. Once you download the app and open it, you will be asked to log in with your Instagram account. 

From there you will see five main tabs: Ideas, Inspiration, Projects, Record, and Insights. The Ideas tab offers creators a space to jot down ideas for new videos and save reels to a collection, and the Inspiration tab features a hub for discovering trending audios and other popular reels. 

The Projects tab is where creators can store and revisit the videos they currently have in progress. This tab is also where creators can upload videos from their phone's camera roll. The Record tab lets creators start filming video content right within Edits. Lastly, the Insights tab gives creators an overview of how their content is performing by surfacing metrics like views, reach, and follower counts. 

Green screen: Replace and edit the background of your videos with one tap.

Timeline: Precisely arrange and adjust clips.

Captions: Add automatic captions to your videos in multiple languages.

Audio library: Add music from Instagram's library to your videos.

Cutouts: Isolate specific objects with precision tracking.

Animate: Turn static images into videos using AI.

Apply all: Apply filters, effects, transitions, and adjustments to all of your clips at once.

Timeline frame rate selector: Convert your video to the frame rate you want in order to enhance playback smoothness. 

Alignment guides: Ensure viewers can see the important parts of your video when posted and accurately position text, emoji, or other elements.

Beat markers: Add auto-detected beat markers to help you align clips, text, and overlays with audio when editing.

Filters: Choose from 30 different filter options to add a unique look to your videos.

Transitions: Choose from 30 different transitions to connect different video clips in a seamless way.

While both Edits and CapCut are great options for editing short-form videos, there are some differences between the two services. 

CapCut offers more robust editing options, including AI features, than Edits does. Of course, this can be expected since Edits is a lot newer than CapCut. Meta will likely continue to build out Edits over the next months and years, so we can expect to see more advanced functionality in the future. It's also worth noting that CapCut has a more extensive music library compared to Edits.

Another difference is the fact that Edits currently doesn't have a subscription offering (for now), but CapCut does. While CapCut offers a free version, some of its advanced tools are locked behind a paid subscription. Edits is free to use, but this will likely change in the future, as Instagram head Adam Mosseri has stated that later versions of Edits may include paid features. 

In addition, while CapCut is available on the web, Edits is mobile-only. However, this could change in the future.

Last month, Intel launched new power-optimized drivers for handheld devices, touting performance gains across various titles. With the latest Arc graphics driver version 32.0.101.6874, Intel is expanding these optimizations to all Core Ultra 200V-powered devices, across laptops and mini-PCs.

Since Intel's Arc is still in its early stages, many initial launches have improved with age due to subsequent driver improvements. This has been evident with Alchemist. Furthermore, despite Battlemage offering a relatively stronger and more stable platform at launch, it's clear there is still untapped potential, as shown by these software-driven improvements.

Intel's Arc graphics driver 32.0.101.6734 introduced notable low-power mode optimizations for Lunar Lake-powered handhelds, specifically the MSI Claw 8 AI+. After extensive validation and testing, Intel is expanding the scope of these optimizations to all devices, whether laptops or mini-PCs. First-party metrics suggest a 10% bump in performance across the board in nine titles, with the Core Ultra 7 258V at 17W, but your mileage will vary.



We'll have to verify these claims through independent testing. It's important to note these improvements are specifically for Intel's low-power Arc 130V and Arc 140V offerings, not the desktop-based Battlemage Arc B-series. The new drivers also address a slew of bugs across various productivity applications and games.

A noteworthy detail in the patch notes is the increased memory allocation for integrated Arc GPUs across Core Ultra Series 1 (Meteor Lake) and Series 2 (Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake) product lines, now supporting up to 57% compared to the previous 50% cap. Thus, a 16GB host system can allocate 9.12GB to the iGPU, as opposed to 8GB previously.

This isn't the first time Intel has offered improved performance through software updates, as a previous driver release from last October increased FPS by as much as 24%. This builds on earlier optimizations for the Arc platform, so we'll probably see further, likely less pronounced improvements down the road. Most software divisions are likely hard at work preparing the groundwork for next-generation Celestial (Xe3) graphics, set to be introduced with Panther Lake early next year.

There's something truly special about having a quality Bluetooth speaker by your side, especially as summer approaches. Whether you're relaxing on a beach, chilling at a campsite or kicking back by a pool, surrounding yourself with good tunes will elevate any situation and you will be happy you had the chance to enjoy it.

Amazon is running a deal where it has marked down the popular and iconic Beats Pill portable Bluetooth speaker to an all -time low, clearing out inventory just in time for summer. Right now, you can get this popular speaker for just $99, which is $50 cheaper than the original list price of $149. This summer's deal has already moved over 4,000 units in the last month with a rating of 4.6 out of 5-stars from more than 1,600 reviews.

See at Amazon

The Beats Pill is a speaker, but it's also a lifestyle accessory: The design is portable and instantly recognizable and the performance is impressive. The Pill can deliver deep and powerful sound and a room filled with sound thanks to a larger, custom racetrack woofer that displaces 90% more air volume than previous iterations.

The bass comes with a punch when you crank it while hosting a backyard barbecue or chillin' when the only thing on your agenda is enjoying peace and quiet at the lake. The tweeter has also been redesigned for some extra stability for those nice crisp highs and rich mid-range tones, while the new woofer material and structure makes it easier to reduce low-end distortion even at reasonable volumes. No matter where you listen, it is dynamic and crystal clear.

The battery life of the Beats Pill is nothing short of amazing and a single charge will last you approximately 24 hours: That is all day, and into the night with all of the music you could want. Plus, if your phone or other device needs a charge, the Pill can charge those devices via USB-C cable and save you from running out of power.

It is rated IP67 dust and water-resistant, so you don't have to worry if you get sand on it, or a splash of water: It will hold up and even for sudden rain showers. The Beats Pill comes with a removable lanyard and soft-grip silicone backing which makes it easy to carry or to handle no matter where your summer adventures lead you.

On top of the Bluetooth connection, audiophiles can enjoy high-resolution lossless audio when used via USB-C to a laptop or other desktop computers. If you want to get serious about sound and double the output, you can pair two Beats Pill speakers together in Amplify mode or Stereo mode. Either way, you will amplify the fun of listening to music. You might even get some extra friends over for the party?

Amazon has the all-time lowest price available for the Pill just before the summer months, and now is your chance to get your very own Beats Pill!

When it comes to power banks, brands like Anker and Ugreen are often top of mind for their strong reputation. However, if you're looking for great value and don't want to compromise on capacity or charging speed, Moihosso is a name worth considering: While Moihosso might not be a household name yet, this brand always provides great prices of many of its products, that make it absolutely irresistible for shoppers.

Currently Moihosso's portable charger power bank, with its huge 56,800mAh sized battery and 22.5W fast charging is available on Amazon at a new all time low price of $34, down its usual price of $239 (which is a massive 85% off). With Amazon selling fast, you'll want to act on it before this deal ends.

See at Amazon

This power bank is for anyone who needs reliable power wherever they are— when you travel for work, when you go camping or to just ensure you never find yourself in that frustrated, low battery and dead phone situation. With its enormous 56,800mAh capacity, this device can charge your iPhone up to 11 times, or your tablet multiple times, all from a single source. That means you can stay connected for days without ever worrying about running out of battery.

Furthermore, incorporating 22.5W fast charging is also a great method to guarantee you quickly charge and power your devices without stressing yourself whether you are racing to prepare for a meeting or shopping. The fast charging capabilities use fast and stable charging power output which guarantees that your devices will always be ready to use. With an average rating of 4.8 out of 5 from all surveys, it has to be reliable, powerful and extremely affordable.

The power bank has two USB-A output ports, as well as one USB-C port with input and output functions so you could easily charge your phone, wireless earbuds, and tablet simultaneously. In addition to that, the power bank is equipped with intelligent rating distribution so you know that each device is receiving the best charging speed possible, which means you won't miss an important phone call from work when your phone dies.

The smart LED display also brings you convenience and peace of mind by showing you the real-time remaining battery percentage. You will no longer need to guess or worry about any unexpected shut downs because you will always know how much power you have left. The Moihosso power bank also provides built-in protections from safety hypothesizes (i.e. overcharging, overheating, and overcurrent) which means you can be assured your devices are charging efficiently and safely.

Be charged, be connected, and be power-stress free wherever the day takes you!

Carrying a tangled mess of chargers and cables in your bag can get very annoying, especially when you have multiple devices that are trying to stay charged throughout the day. Whether you are traveling on business or just trying to stay productive at home, you know you need a dependable and flexible charging option. That's where Ugreen comes in – a brand that's established a presence for quality and innovation with charging options.

Right now, Amazon is offering the premium Ugreen 65W USB-C/USB-A 4-Port charger at the lowest price ever: At only $29, which is a 30% off the list price of $42, this small but mighty charger is a no-brainer. The deal is so good that Amazon is rapidly clearing out its stock, so you need to make sure you get it before it runs out of stock.

See at Amazon

The Ugreen 65W USB-C (and USB-A) charger is a real asset if you have multiple devices you manage. Whether you are charging a MacBook Pro, iPhone, iPad, Galaxy S25 or even a Steam Deck, this charger will work. With 65W of charging power, you can charge a MacBook Air to 51% in a quick 30 minutes so it's great for a quick charge as you're heading out the door. With three USB-C ports and one USB-A port simultaneously charge four devices, so there is no need for a tangly mess of chargers littering your workspace or travel bag.

This Ugreen charger uses GaN (Gallium Nitride) technology instead of traditional silicon: GaN is a smaller, more efficient and safer material than its silicon-based counterparts.

Everybody loves a good foot massage. As an avid runner with plantar fasciitis, I often need a good foot massage. So when I heard about the Nike x Hyperice collaboration to develop a shoe with compression and heating capabilities built in, I was eager to learn more.

The Hyperboots feature the same air compression technology as the beloved-by-runners-everywhere Hyperice Normatec boots ($899). The only downside to the Normatec boots are the fact that you have to chill out and remain horizontal while you wear them (which, maybe isn't exactly a downside, but it still means you can't multitask much during your recovery period). With the Hyperboots, you can enjoy the same squeezing and releasing sensation around your feet and ankles while you go about your life. Thanks to Nike's input, you can wear something that looks more like a sleek, modern sneaker than a recovery device.

The first time I tried on—and turned on—the Hyperboots, I was immediately giddy. There's something very exciting about a shoe with extras built in. It reminded me of Heelys and the popular light-up tennis shoes of my '90s youth. When you turn them on by pressing a power button on the inside of the heel, the shoe automatically inflates to offer a better fit and some mild compression. The compression portion covers the mid-foot at the top and sides, the sides and back of the heel, and the ankle.

I got small Hyperboots (they come in small, medium, large, XL, and XXL) and they were too big for my size-8 feet, but turning on the shoe made comfortable enough to walk around in them without my foot slipping around.

From there, you have the option to adjust the level of compression and heat, with three settings each, and you can press a play button to start an active air-compression massage. The boots sync settings when you have them both on. The air filling up the ankle wrap and releasing does make a droning noise, almost like an airplane flying overhead—nothing too obnoxious. You can charge them up with the two USB-C cords and wall charger they come with, and the charge lasts for up to an hour and a half.

The massage and heat felt wonderful while I did chores around the house. I noticed the plush foam soles and their rocker bottoms, which helped propel me forward with little effort. The forefoot and heel provide grippy traction. The shoes don't offer much in terms of arch support, so I wouldn't recommend walking far in them if you have high, fussy arches like me (without adding some inserts), but they were comfortable enough all the times I wore them.

The upper feels extremely durable, and even with the built-in tech, they can handle splashes and rain (though they aren't fully waterproof). I liked the highest compression setting for my feet, but that setting felt like a bit much around my ankles when I was walking. The top of the ankle wrap dug in a bit when I moved, but it wasn't uncomfortable if I was sitting. The massage runs for 20 minutes, and you can just press play again to start over if your dogs need some more TLC. The heat settings go all the way up to 125 degrees Fahrenheit, which was way too hot for me—I found the lowest setting of 111 degrees to be plenty to feel therapeutic.

After trying the shoes around the house, I was excited to use them after an activity that was harder on my feet. I put them on after a long day snowboarding where I racked up over 13,000 feet of vert, and I was able to drive home through the mountains while my feet warmed up and got a relaxing massage—incredible. The boots flushed out the lactic acid that had built up in my feet and ankles from all the maneuvering they were doing inside my bindings, and I was able to keep the massage going after I got home and while I did laundry and dishes.

Usually when I go to bed after a day on the mountain, my legs ache and it can make it hard to fall asleep. Not the case after wearing the Hyperboots. I wasn't sore that night, or the next day, like I normally am.

I'd love these boots even more if they could somehow extend the air-compression around the bottom of the foot across the arch and heel. As someone with plantar fasciitis, that's where I really need it. The air-compression doesn't feel like a real massage. It's still wonderful and great for increasing blood flow and expediting recovery, but even the highest compression setting couldn't apply as much pressure to my feet as I'd personally prefer.

It would also be amazing if the shoes could provide cooling or icing as well. When I wore these after a handful of runs, they absolutely made my feet feel better and sped up my recovery, but for how much they cost, I wanted more. Still, having these in my rotation during marathon training or after a long hike will be a game-changer. As someone who often ventures to the mountains to train, being able to recover while I'm on the road back—or while I stop at a brewery for a burger and a beer—feels like a cheat code for life.

I'm about to head out on a long weekend road trip that, if all goes to plan, will have me hiking four days in a row. There's no way I'm not packing the Hyperboots. And the one good thing about them running a bit big and being able to somewhat conform to your feet? I can share them with my buddies after our biggest adventures.

Another cool aspect of the Hyperboots is the fact that you can wear them while you warm up for a sport, using the heat and compression to relax and knead your muscles into a flexible, less injury-prone state. I tried this a few times pre-run, and while I enjoyed the feeling and noticed a slight benefit (feeling more warmed up for my run with less effort), I definitely enjoy them more for post-workout recovery. They don't fit me very well, so I couldn't wear them for a whole dynamic warm-up with track drills, though they worked fine for walking around the house before I changed into my running shoes.

When they're not turned on—and therefore not slightly inflated—the Hyperboots feel pretty clunky. They slid around on my feet. The part of the shoe above the mid foot, where the Velcro wrap opens up, also chafes. I wish they came in more sizes so I could get a better fit, and likely, an even better massage. With the chunky heels extending far past my ankle, they also look a bit ridiculous. Not that that really matters, but I'd be more inclined to wear them around in the real world if I could get a slightly smaller size. When people with bigger feet wear them, I think they look cool.

If you struggle with foot and ankle injuries or mobility, the Hyperboots could really upgrade your warm-up and recovery game. Overall, they just feel good. And if you're a high-level athlete, having the latest recovery devices in your arsenal can really make a difference in terms of injury prevention and training and competition performance.

For the average person, these probably won't lead to a huge shift in how you train or race or play your sport of choice, but they certainly won't hurt. It just comes down to whether you want to drop $900 for a recovery tool. If being able to take care of your feet without slowing down is a priority, the Hyperboots could be worth it. Either way, I'm excited to see what Nike and Hyperice do with future iterations. The Hyperboots are just one aspect of a really cool and innovative sector of the recovery industry that lets you seamlessly integrate your rehab tools into your life.

In contrast, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D adopts a monolithic eight-core/16-thread Zen 5 design, augmented by AMD's 3D V-Cache technology, which stacks an additional 64MB of L3 cache atop the existing 32MB (96MB total). This configuration prioritizes gaming and applications sensitive to memory latency, sacrificing pricing for specialized cache advantages.

Architecturally, the Core Ultra 285K is built on the 3nm production process, promising significant efficiency gains over previous nodes. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D utilizes TSMC's refined N4P (4nm) process, optimizing power efficiency while retaining compatibility with AM5 motherboards via BIOS updates. Clock speeds diverge sharply: Intel's chip operates at a base of 3.7 GHz and boosts up to 5.7 GHz on P-cores, while AMD's X3D variant, constrained by thermal limits from its stacked cache, maintains a lower base of 4.7 GHz and peak boost of 5.2 GHz.

Memory and platform support further highlight their differences. The Core Ultra 285K supports DDR5-6400 natively and requires Intel's new LGA1851 socket with 800-series chipsets, necessitating motherboard upgrades. It also features a PCIe 5.0 controller and supports Thunderbolt 4.

The Ryzen 7 9800X3D retains compatibility with existing AM5 motherboards (X670/B650), reducing upgrade costs, and supports DDR5-5600 officially, though EXPO overclocking enables higher speeds. AMD's chip lacks Thunderbolt but includes the PCIe 5.0 interface for GPUs and NVMe storage. Both CPUs align with industry standards, but Intel's platform demands newer infrastructure for full feature access.

The Core Ultra 285K has a base TDP of 125W and a turbo power limit (PL2) of 250W, typical of Intel's hybrid architecture under heavy loads. AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D operates at a 120W TDP, with tighter thermal constraints due to the 3D V-Cache's sensitivity to heat. While Intel's higher power envelope suits enthusiasts with robust cooling, AMD's efficiency-focused approach appeals to users prioritizing thermals and noise.

🏆Winner: Tie

The Core Ultra 285K and Ryzen 7 9800X3D cater to distinct user bases. Intel's hybrid core layout and cutting-edge node aim for productivity supremacy, whereas AMD's cache-centric design and AM5 stability prioritize gaming and upgradability. It is up to the potential buyer to decide which specs best cater to their needs, but by the spec sheet alone, Intel is competitive in this round due to its higher core count and clock speed, but AMD's chip comes with a beefy 96MB of L3 cache that the 285K's miserly 36MB simply can't match. That leaves us with a tie in this category.

Below we provide an overview of the gaming performance of both these CPUs, but you can always consult our in-depth reviews for an even more detailed analysis. These benchmark graphs display the average FPS and 1% lows for a wide range of games at 1080p, highlighting the difference between the two CPUs.

We paired the CPUs with the powerful Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card to minimize any bottlenecks that may occur. This particular test configuration is ideal for analyzing the difference in CPU performance without worrying about a GPU bottleneck.

The gaming performance comparison between the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Intel Core 9 285K is a beatdown, with the AMD processor coming out on top. Based on our thorough testing results, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D delivers an average of 195.5 FPS across 16 games at the 1080p resolution, which is approximately 35% faster than the Core 9 285K's 144.9 FPS average. This performance gap represents a significant advantage for AMD, especially considering the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is priced at $480 compared to the Core 9 285K's $590 price tag.

When examining frame consistency, which is critical for smooth gameplay, the difference is also noticeable. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D maintains a 1% low framerate of 134 FPS, compared to the Core 9 285K's 107 FPS. This 25% advantage in minimum framerates means the AMD chip provides noticeably smoother gameplay with fewer stutters or frame drops during graphically intensive moments.

The exceptional gaming performance of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D can be directly attributed to AMD's innovative 3D V-Cache technology. This architecture stacks additional L3 cache vertically on the CPU die, dramatically increasing the total cache available to the processor. While the Core 9 285K relies on traditional cache arrangements, the Ryzen's expanded cache capacity allows it to store substantially more game data close to the execution cores, reducing the need to access slower system RAM.

The Ryzen 7 9800X3D's dominance is particularly pronounced in titles like Baldur's Gate 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. In Baldur's Gate 3, the 9800X3D delivers 175.2 FPS on average (117 FPS 1% low), while the 285K manages only 117.1 FPS (88 FPS 1% low)—a 49% advantage for AMD. Similarly, in Cyberpunk 2077, the 9800X3D achieves 143.7 FPS (111 FPS 1% low) compared to the 285K's 118.9 FPS (99 FPS 1% low), a 20.9% advantage. These gains are a direct result of the 3D V-Cache's ability to keep frequently accessed game data readily available, minimizing stalls and improving frame pacing.

What makes the 3D V-Cache so effective for gaming, specifically, is how modern games access memory. Games typically have non-sequential memory access patterns with limited predictability, making them highly sensitive to memory latency rather than just bandwidth. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D's larger cache serves as an effective buffer against these memory access penalties, keeping more critical game data close to the execution cores. This directly translates to the 35% higher average frame rates and 25% better frame consistency demonstrated in our benchmark results.

From a value perspective, the comparison becomes even more favorable toward AMD. Not only does the Ryzen 7 9800X3D outperform the Intel Core 9 285K by a substantial margin, but it also costs approximately $120-140 less. This creates a scenario where gamers get significantly better performance while spending nearly 25% less on their CPU.

🏆Winner: AMD

For competitive gamers seeking every possible advantage, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D's 35% faster average gaming performance provides headroom that could be crucial in high-refresh-rate gaming scenarios. The smoother frame delivery, evidenced by the 1% low metrics, also contributes to more consistent input response and system predictability.

The Ryzen 7 9800X3D's 3D V-Cache gives it a decisive edge over the Core 9 285K in gaming, delivering higher average FPS, smoother 1% lows, and better scalability. While the 285K remains a capable gaming CPU, it cannot overcome the architectural advantages of AMD's cache-rich design, making the 9800X3D the clear choice for enthusiasts prioritizing raw gaming performance.

The Intel Core Ultra 9 285K and AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D exhibit stark differences in productivity performance, particularly in multi-threaded workloads. In Cinebench 2024's multi-core benchmark, the 285K scores 2496, outpacing the 9800X3D's 1376 by 81%, a decisive advantage in favor of Team Blue. This significant lead highlights the Core Ultra 9 285K's superior scalability across multiple cores, making it a powerhouse for heavily parallelized workloads, such as 3D rendering, video encoding, or simulation tasks.

This gap widens further in POV-Ray's multi-core test, where the 285K achieves 15,464 PPS compared to the 9800X3D's 7,783—a 98.6% lead. These results highlight Intel's dominance in raw multi-threaded throughput, likely due to its higher core and thread count, as well as its architectural efficiency in distributed workloads.

Single-threaded performance, while less lopsided, still favors the 285K. In Cinebench 2024's single-core test, the 285K scores 148.9, edging out the 9800X3D's 134.5 by 10.7%. The disparity grows in POV-Ray's single-core benchmark, where the 285K's 1,116 PPS outperforms the 9800X3D's 791 by 41%.

The Lame benchmark, which measures single-threaded audio encoding (converting a 250MB WAV to MP3), shows a closer race, with the Core Ultra 9 285K completing the task in 8.83 seconds versus the Ryzen 7 9800X3D's 9.05 seconds—a difference of 0.22 seconds, or roughly 2.4%. Intel's superior single-threaded performance suggests advantages in latency-sensitive tasks like application startup or lightly threaded software.

The overall geomean rankings reinforce these trends. In multi-threaded productivity, the 285K occupies a higher tier, while the 9800X3D lags significantly by a margin of nearly 69%. The single-threaded Geomean places the 285K at 276 versus the 9800X3D's 243, a 13.6% delta. These metrics underscore Intel's consistent lead across both workload types, though AMD's lower price ($480 vs $590) may appeal to budget-focused users willing to trade peak performance for value.

The Core Ultra 9 285K's architecture, likely benefiting from higher clock speeds and improved IPC (instructions per cycle), gives it an edge in single-threaded scenarios, while its higher core and thread count, paired with efficient multi-core scaling, drive its dominance in multi-threaded tests.

🏆Winner: Intel

The Core Ultra 9 285K is the unequivocal choice for users prioritizing maximum multi-threaded performance, with leads exceeding 80% in key benchmarks. The 9800X3D, while more affordable, struggles to compete in these scenarios, making it better suited for gaming-focused builds or workloads where its cache architecture can mitigate its raw compute shortcomings. For general productivity, Intel's offering delivers a compelling performance premium, albeit at a higher cost.

The Intel Core Ultra 9 285K and AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D exhibit fundamentally different approaches to overclocking, reflecting their architectural priorities. Intel's platform emphasizes granular control, offering unlocked multipliers for both performance (P) and efficiency (E) cores, along with separate voltage adjustments for each core type. This allows enthusiasts to fine-tune frequencies in small increments while balancing power delivery across the hybrid architecture.

The processor's thermal design also supports aggressive tuning, with a configurable TjMax up to 115°C compared to AMD's 95°C limit. However, Intel's overclocking potential remains constrained by the inherent complexity of managing 24 heterogeneous cores (8P+16E), requiring careful coordination between core types.

AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D breaks new ground for 3D V-Cache processors by introducing Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) support, marking the first time an X3D chip has official overclocking capabilities. The redesigned cache placement—now beneath the compute die rather than stacked atop it—improves thermal conductivity, addressing a key limitation that previously restricted manual tuning on X3D models.

While the multiplier remains unlocked, AMD's approach prioritizes automated frequency optimization through its boost algorithms, with manual adjustments primarily focusing on power limits and thermal thresholds rather than raw clock speeds. This reflects the inherent challenges of overclocking cache-sensitive designs.

Intel's platform offers a more traditional overclocking experience, featuring extensive BIOS-level controls, including per-core frequency adjustments and independent voltage regulation for different core types. This makes the Core Ultra 9 285K better suited for enthusiasts willing to invest time in meticulous tuning.

AMD's solution offers greater accessibility through its Ryzen Master software, which simplifies PBO configuration while maintaining safeguards for the delicate 3D cache structure.

🏆Winner: Intel

For most users, the 9800X3D's automated boost algorithms deliver near-maximum performance without manual intervention, but it lacks Intel's depth of low-level control. Ultimately, the Core Ultra 9 285K's architectural flexibility and higher thermal limits make it the more overclocking-friendly option for dedicated tuners, while the 9800X3D prioritizes out-of-the-box efficiency with limited but accessible manual tuning capabilities

The Intel Core Ultra 9 285K and AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D exhibit distinct power consumption profiles across idle and load scenarios, reflecting their architectural differences.

In idle states, the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K demonstrates superior efficiency compared to the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D. The pure idle power consumption test shows the Core Ultra 9 285K drawing just 16 watts compared to the Ryzen 7 9800X3D's 20 watts, representing a 20% power advantage for Intel. This difference is relatively consistent when examining the active idle scenario (such as during YouTube playback), where Intel's chip consumes 23 watts versus AMD's 29 watts, maintaining a 20.7% efficiency advantage. Intel's architecture appears more optimized for low-power states, which could benefit users who leave their systems idle for extended periods.

Under heavy multi-threaded AVX workloads, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D showcases dramatically better efficiency. In the y-cruncher benchmark, the AMD chip consumes 176W, while the Core 9 285K draws 287W—a staggering 63% more power for Intel. In the Prime95 benchmark with AVX instructions enabled (representing intensive workloads), the Core Ultra 9 285K draws a substantial 325 watts of power, while the Ryzen 7 9800X3D consumes just 171 watts. This represents a staggering 90% higher power consumption for the Intel processor, which is offset by higher performance.

In our efficiency benchmarks, the results are mixed. The Core 9 285K edges out the Ryzen 7 9800X3D in Cinebench 2024's “Watts per Point” metric, scoring 10.3 vs. AMD's 10.2 (higher is better). However, this marginal 1% difference pales compared to the y-cruncher disparity.

The Blender Classroom efficiency chart offers perhaps the most illuminating comparison of real-world efficiency. This benchmark plots task energy (in kilojoules) against performance (samples per minute), with the ideal position being the bottom-right corner, where more performance is achieved with less energy.

The Core Ultra 9 285K delivers approximately 120-130 samples per minute but requires around 29,000-32,000 kilojoules to do so. In contrast, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D delivers fewer samples (approximately 80-90 per minute) but consumes dramatically less energy at approximately 10,000-12,000 kilojoules. This means that while Intel's processor is roughly 40-50% faster in raw performance, it consumes nearly three times the energy to achieve this performance advantage, making the AMD solution significantly more efficient on a performance-per-watt basis.

Cooling requirements align closely with power consumption, as higher wattage translates to greater heat output. The Intel Core Ultra 9 285K's peak load consumption of 325 watts in Prime95 demands robust cooling, potentially a 360mm AIO liquid cooler, to manage temperatures effectively, especially given that its thermal output could exceed 90°C under stress.

In contrast, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D's 171 watts in the same test consumes roughly half the power, which is manageable with a mid-range air cooler or a 240mm AIO, keeping temperatures below 80°C. Even at idle, the 7-watt difference (16W vs. 20W) is negligible for cooling compared to load demands. Thus, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D's lower thermal profile makes it significantly easier to cool, reducing system costs and noise levels.

🏆Winner: AMD

Based on the comprehensive power consumption data, the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D emerges as the clearly superior choice for energy efficiency, particularly under load conditions where the difference is most pronounced. While Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K does hold a 20% advantage in idle power consumption, this benefit is overshadowed by its substantially higher power draw during actual computation tasks.

For users prioritizing energy efficiency, lower heat output, quieter operation, or systems with limited cooling capacity, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D represents a significantly better option. The Intel processor may justify its higher power consumption only in specific use cases where its raw performance advantage outweighs efficiency concerns; however, in most scenarios, AMD's offering delivers a much better balance of performance and power consumption.

Intel launched the Core Ultra 9 285K with a price tag of $620, but nowadays it can be found retailing for around $590. At first glance, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D holds a clear price advantage, retailing at $480 compared to the Core Ultra 9 285K's $590 price tag—a $119 (20%) savings on the CPU alone. However, platform costs (such as motherboard, RAM, and cooling) must be taken into consideration when evaluating the overall value proposition of modern CPUs.

Intel's LGA 1851 platform (and the new 800-series chipsets) demands premium pricing for full feature access, with mid-range boards averaging between $250–$300. AMD's AM5 platform, although initially more expensive, now offers budget-friendly B650 boards starting at $150–$200, providing comparable PCIe 5.0 and even overclocking support. You can even step up to an X670 motherboard, and the overall platform cost will still be lower than a comparable Intel setup.

The Ryzen 7 9800X3D also benefits from AM5's longevity, with AMD committing to socket support through 2025+, allowing for future upgrades without requiring a motherboard swap. Intel's LGA 1851 is expected to last only 1–2 generations, limiting long-term value. Both CPUs use DDR5 RAM, but AMD's EXPO optimization often allows tighter timings at similar costs.

The Core 9 285K's has a higher peak power draw, as we have already discussed, which necessitates a high-end air cooler ($80–$100) or a 240 mm+ AIO liquid cooler ($120+). In contrast, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D's lower peak power draw can be managed with a mid-range air cooler ($40–$60), saving quite a decent chunk of change.

The Ryzen 7 9800X3D dominates in power-sensitive workloads (e.g., 63% lower power draw in y-cruncher), reducing long-term electricity costs for heavy users. While the Core 9 285K edges ahead in lightly threaded tasks, even though this marginal advantage doesn't offset its platform premium. For gaming, AMD's 3D V-Cache typically delivers superior frame rates, further justifying its value.

🏆Winner: AMD

Combining all the categories, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the unequivocal value champion. Its significant platform savings, combined with superior efficiency, lower cooling demands, and future-proof AM5 compatibility, make it ideal for value-conscious builders and upgraders. For 95% of users—especially gamers—the Ryzen 7 9800X3D delivers higher performance per dollar and long-term savings.

While the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K offers stronger multi-core performance, its higher cost and greater cooling demands make it less appealing unless the user specifically requires its productivity-focused features.

The score chalks up to a 3 to 4 win in the Ryzen 7 9800X3D vs Intel Core Ultra 9 285K showdown, with the win going to the 9800X3D. However, while the score reveals the winner, the reality is a bit murkier given the distinct price tiers and target markets for these chips.

Neither the Intel Core Ultra 285K nor the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D emerges as the undisputed champion of both gaming and productivity disciplines in a direct head-to-head comparison. Instead, their strengths align with distinct user priorities.

For gamers, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D's 3D V-Cache delivers a tangible edge, significantly reducing latency in titles that thrive on rapid data access, making it the go-to choice for high-refresh 1080p or 1440p gaming.

Conversely, the Core Ultra 285K's hybrid architecture, with its 24 cores and aggressive boost clocks, excels in productivity workloads such as video rendering, 3D modeling, and multitasking, where thread count and raw throughput are more crucial. This split highlights a recurring industry trend: AMD optimizes for specialized efficiency, while Intel focuses on multi-threaded scalability.

The price-to-performance conversation further tilts the scales. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D not only undercuts Intel's offering in cost but also leverages AM5 platform longevity, allowing users to upgrade CPUs without replacing motherboards—a boon for budget-conscious builders. Intel's LGA1851 platform, while future-proofed, demands a pricier motherboard overhaul.

However, the Core Ultra 285K justifies its premium with higher performance in productivity workloads, Thunderbolt 4 support, and higher DDR5 speeds, appealing to professionals needing cutting-edge I/O or memory bandwidth. Value here is subjective: AMD caters to cost-aware gamers, while Intel targets power users willing to invest in top-tier productivity.

⭐Winner: AMD

The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D comes out on top in our faceoff, but there's plenty of nuance. While this chip is a stellar performer for gaming and presents a wonderful value, it simply can't match the 285K's prowess in productivity workloads. That's not surprising, given the price delta.

Ultimately, the decision hinges on use case and personal preference. If gaming dominates your workload, the Ryzen's cache advantage and lower thermal footprint make it irresistible — the Ryzen 7 9800X3D remains the undisputed gaming champion in this general price range. For creators and professionals, Intel's hybrid cores and frequency headroom offer stronger performance in demanding tasks, leaving it a smaller audience in enthusiast builds.

Both CPUs excel within their niches, reflecting a market where specialization trumps one-size-fits-all solutions. Your choice isn't about what's “better”—it's about what's better for you.

This story originally appeared on Inside Climate News and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The Trump administration's ever-changing policies on tariffs and trade have injected chaos into the global energy economy.

On Wednesday, a federal court blocked President Donald Trump from being able to adopt tariffs under an emergency-powers law. The administration is appealing the ruling. This sets up additional legal wrangling in addition to the conflicts over trade that were already happening.

Analysts at the research firm Wood Mackenzie gave themselves the task of predicting where US tariff policy may be heading. The result is a report issued this week, “Trading Cases: Tariff Scenarios for Taxing Times,” that shows the huge gap in outcomes between a trade war and a trade truce.

My main takeaway from it is that everyone loses in a prolonged conflict. Even the oil and gas industry, which has close ties to the Trump administration, would face falling prices for its products at the same time that the costs of much of its equipment are rising because of tariffs.

The US renewable energy and battery industries stand out for the potential severity of their downturns because development here relies heavily on components made in other countries. The Biden administration sought to encourage manufacturers to build in the United States, but those efforts are still in their early stages, and many of the government incentives are now on the chopping block.

Under a “trade truce” scenario, in which tariffs return to 2024 levels, the global economy would grow by an average of 2.7 percent between now and 2030, the report says. The “trade tensions” scenario would mean that tariff barriers increase compared to last year, but the economy would still grow, albeit at a lower rate. The most damaging is the “trade war” scenario, with the United States maintaining an effective tariff rate of 30 percent or more, leading to a global recession.

The report says the middle forecast, “trade tensions,” is the most likely to occur.

Why is this conflict happening? The short version is that Trump and his advisers believe that tariffs will help the US economy by encouraging construction of factories here, reducing trade deficits and punishing barriers to entry of US products in other countries.

“We will supercharge our domestic industrial base,” Trump said in an April 2 speech announcing tariffs on nearly every US trading partner. “We will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers and ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers.”

A tariff is a tax charged by a government on imports. As the US government has increased its tariffs, other countries have retaliated with their own increases.

Adding to the chaos is that the policies frequently change, with the president often announcing shifts on social media, as happened in recent days on tariffs on the European Union.

I spoke with Chris Seiple, Wood Mackenzie's vice chairman for power and renewables, to drill down on the parts of the report that deal with renewables. Here is that conversation, edited for length and clarity:

Dan Gearino: For renewable energy industries, is the big problem that tariffs make everything more expensive, or is there more to it than that?

Chris Seiple: Sure, things getting more expensive is a big part of it. I think the second challenge, and this is kind of unique to the power business, is that there's a heavy hand of regulation. And so there's a lot of US utilities that have to go through pretty extensive regulatory processes to get approval for what they want to build. Being in a world where there's so much tariff uncertainty, they don't know what it's going to cost to build what they want to build. It's particularly challenging for this industry to be able to navigate that, and it impacts renewables more than it impacts, say, other sectors like gas or coal, because we rely upon imports of equipment to such a bigger degree, especially for battery storage, where we're essentially entirely dependent at this point on imports from China.

With battery storage, there has been an attempt to increase manufacturing capacity in the US. How would you characterize where that stands?

Very early days. A lot of battery manufacturing that's going on within the US is meant to supply batteries to EV vehicles, not stationary utility-scale storage projects. And so the amount of manufacturing capacity in comparison to what the demand is for that equipment results in us importing well more than 90 percent of what we need.

Chris Seiple is Wood Mackenzie's vice chairman for power and renewables.

I also think the tariff on it is just as important as the uncertainty about not knowing where the end game is and what the tariffs are going to be. So, if you're on the manufacturing side of the renewables business, you're making investment decisions that have very long lives when you're building a manufacturing facility. Having that uncertainty around the investment climate and what the level of tariffs is going to be over the long-term just makes it more challenging to make all of those decisions.

During the early part of this year, as this tariff war was starting, I had, like, biweekly calls from this manufacturer in Korea, just exasperated, saying, “Doesn't the US government know that we're making long lead time decisions, and we need to have some sort of clarity around what the policy environment is going to be, not just for the next four years, but for the next 10 years?” The US is making it very challenging right now to make these types of investment decisions.

Is there any US energy industry that benefits from trade tensions?

I don't think anybody benefits, per se, from the trade tensions. Everybody, no matter what part of the energy sector you're in, is having to navigate the uncertainty around what the tariff levels are going to be. That said, the overall policy environment has changed to one that is more favorable for natural gas. The fact that we are an exporter of natural gas and have all of the domestic resources that we need makes it less impacted by tariffs than what other sectors are, like renewables. But even for E&P [exploration and production of oil and gas], they utilize steel in that process. There are tariffs on steel. Steel prices have gone up. It has a negative impact on all energy sectors.

One part of this report that jumped out to me is you said that the US may be stuck with older technologies, especially when it comes to solar, while the rest of the world advances at a quicker pace. What's the long-term effect of that?

Before I answer that question directly, let me just give you some context.

We estimate that the cost of building a utility-scale solar project is about $1.15 a watt in the US. The comparable number in China is about 42 cents a watt. It's not surprising that the cost of building a solar facility in China is a lot less than the cost of building a solar facility in the US.

What is very surprising when we put this data together is how much less expensive it is to build a solar project in Europe than it is in the US. It's about 70 cents a watt to build a solar facility in Europe compared to the US. So the US is almost 50 percent more expensive to build a solar facility than the cost of building it in Europe. And the biggest reason that it's more expensive here is because of all the tariffs that we have on solar. It's not the only reason, but it's the biggest reason. So we've already kind of penalized solar with the tariffs that we have in place.

And then, on the technology evolution issue, it's the Chinese manufacturers that have the most sophisticated capability in solar manufacturing, and who are putting a lot more R&D into it than any US company is doing. And so, we essentially have policies in place that prohibit and make it uneconomic for US companies to be able to purchase Chinese technology, then that is what leaves us in a position where we're not using the most advanced technology that's available to the rest of the world. The long-term implication of that is it deprives the US of a low-cost source of energy that's available everywhere else, and creates kind of an unlevel playing field in our efforts to have to power our industries with the lowest-cost energy solutions that are available.

These tariff policies seem to change almost daily. Is there an expectation that eventually things will settle down?

I think that's the central challenge for the industry, that they don't know where the ultimate outcome is going to fall. Nobody can really fully answer that question, and what makes it particularly challenging is that there've been so many different rationales given as to why we're pursuing one tariff or another that it makes it hard to divine what the ultimate endgame is going to be. Is it about reducing a trade balance? Is it about supporting domestic manufacturing? Are there other policy goals that are trying to be achieved as a result of the tariffs? Not knowing that is what makes it very difficult for people to operate day to day.

Confused by Apple's naming conventions? You're not the only one. Bloomberg reports that this year at WWDC, Apple plans to announce a broad overhaul of all of its operating systems. That includes renaming them to be more consistent. Starting this year, Apple will reportedly begin denoting each OS version for each product by year, instead of by version. Confusingly, it will start with the next year, rather than this year (just like cars). So the versions we'll see at this year's WWDC will not be iOS 25, but rather iOS 26, watchOS 26, and so on, in place of iOS 19 and watchOS 12.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

The move is reportedly part of a larger push toward a cohesive user experience across platforms. The overhaul could encompass everything from updated icons, apps, buttons, and a fresh design language, and it's expected to be universal across all the operating systems. Apple's fundamentally simple and irresistible user interface is a core part of the company's DNA, so it will be interesting to see how customers react to a big redesign (hopefully better than the Apple Photos redesign). We'll find out at WWDC, which kicks off on June 9 at 1 pm ET. —Adrienne So

After a light smattering of features when it launched the OnePlus 13 in January, OnePlus is now ready to go all in on AI for its phones. Its approach is quite similar to what Nothing introduced a few months ago on the Nothing Phone (3a) series: a dedicated AI button on the side of the phone, though this one replaces the original OnePlus Alert Slider.

Dubbed the Plus Key, you can customize it to trigger specific apps or shortcuts on the phone, with an interface that looks almost exactly like Apple's Action Button. By default, it launches AI Plus Mind, a system that will save whatever's on the screen so you can recall it later. The idea is that you'll press it when you see an ad for a concert while browsing, or an event invite—pressing the Plus Key will save the relevant info in the companion app, and the app will extract helpful info to create a calendar event on your behalf.

The Plus Key and AI Plus Mind will debut first on the OnePlus 13s, a phone launching in select markets this June; it's not coming to the US. Later this year, the AI features will roll out to the OnePlus 13 series, with other devices to follow. OnePlus says it's actively working on more features like AI VoiceScribe, to record, summarize, and translate calls and meetings; AI Translation, to consolidate all translation capabilities into one app; and AI Reframe, to adjust the composition of your shots with generative AI.

Samsung is rumored to announce its next generation of folding phones sometime this summer—the Galaxy Z Fold7 and Z Flip7—and the company officially confirmed this in a blog post announcing the rollout of the One UI 8 beta program. One UI is the name of Samsung's Android layer, and version eight is based on the upcoming version of Android 16.

While the beta program will be available for existing devices, Samsung says One UI 8 will “debut on Samsung's newest foldables this summer,” making them the first to run Android 16. That's a break from the norm, as Google historically made its Pixel devices the first to run the latest version of Android. This is likely because Google moved up the Android 16 window; instead of arriving in October, it's coming midsummer.

Google celebrated the 10th anniversary of Google Photos on May 28, and it has dished out a few new features to mark the occasion, including making a few Pixel 9-exclusive capabilities—like the Reimagine and Auto Frame AI features—more broadly available.

A redesigned editor now also shows more editing tools at a glance, and you can also select parts of the image to access specific tools instead of hunting for them in menus. For example, tap the background of an image to pull up the portrait blur tool so you can adjust the strength of the background blur effect. A new “AI Enhance” button will also merge several of Google's AI capabilities, like Magic Eraser, with other standard editing tools for a faster edit. The new redesigned editing layout will roll out to Android devices in June, with iOS getting the update later this year.

Also new is the capability to generate a QR code to share albums with people around you (or print it out for group events). You can let folks who scan the code add their own images to the album, too.

Ricoh has announced the GR IV pocket camera, the successor to the GR III, one of the best pocket cameras I've ever tested. The GR IV has a new lens with seven elements, but it remains the same focal length: 18.3mm f/2.8 (roughly 28mm in 35mm equivalent). So far, no word on whether there will be a GR IVx to replace the 40mm lens model.

The GR IV has an updated APS-C sensor that bumps the resolution slightly from 24 megapixels to 26. The neutral density filter remains, and while the outside appears to have been redesigned, with slightly different buttons, the basic silhouette is the same. Like the GR III, there is no flash. A built-in flash would be nice (the GR II had one), but the ISO range of the GR IV is better, reaching 204,800 ISO at the top end, which should help with low-light photography. There's also five-axis stabilization (up from the three-axis of the GR III).

Perhaps the most interesting news for fans of the GR camera series is that there will be face and eye detection autofocus tracking, which would seem to mean autofocus has been improved. If the GR III has a weakness, it's autofocus. There will also be 53 gigabytes of built-in storage (usable), which is perfect for a camera like this, though my enthusiasm for that is tempered by the fact that the GR IV will use microSD cards rather than full-size SD.

The GR IV is set to arrive this fall, with another model featuring a Highlight Diffusion Filter coming "after winter 2025." Interestingly, Ricoh says production and shipment of the Ricoh GR III will stop in July 2025, due to difficulty in procuring parts and components. The 40mm GRIIIx will continue to be sold for now. —Scott Gilbertson

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about one out of every three adults around the world lives with high blood pressure. 

Clinically known as hypertension, this medical condition occurs when the force with which blood flows through the arteries is too high.

Past research shows that having high blood pressure can increase a person's risk for several health issues, including stroke, aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and dementia. 

In addition to medications, people are able to manage their high blood pressure through a variety of lifestyle changes, including not smoking, getting enough exercise, managing stress, and eating a healthy diet. 

While the DASH diet has traditionally been the go-to diet for hypertension, over the last few years the Mediterranean and ketogenic (keto) diets have also gained in popularity. 

A study published in April 2024 reported that following the Mediterranean diet was linked to a lower risk for high blood pressure. Another study published in July 2019 showed that following a low carbohydrate diet like the keto diet helped lower blood pressure readings in people with type 2 diabetes.

Now, a new study offers further evidence that both the Mediterranean and keto diets can help lower a person's blood pressure and improve cardiovascular health measurements in people who have obesity or overweight.

The findings were published in the journal Nutrients. 

For this study, researchers recruited 26 adults who had obesity or overweight, had high-normal blood pressure or grade 1 hypertension, and low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk scores. 

Eleven of the study participants were randomly assigned to follow the Mediterranean diet, and the remaining 15 followed the keto diet over a period of three months.

At the study's conclusion, researchers found that participants in both diet groups experienced a decrease in blood pressure and weight loss after three months. 

Scientists also found that participants in both diet groups experienced an increase in their fat-free mass — the total mass of the body excluding fat — and a decrease in their body fat, blood lipid levels, and insulin concentrations. 

There was one area where researchers reported a difference between the Mediterranean and keto diets. They reported that participants following the keto diet had a higher level of “nocturnal dipping” than those in the keto group.

“Nocturnal dipping refers to the natural decrease in blood pressure that occurs when we sleep,” Cheng-Han Chen, MD, a board certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA — who is not associated with this study — told Medical News Today. 

“It is a measure of healthy blood pressure regulation, and abnormal nocturnal dipping patterns have been associated with increased risk of heart disease,” he said.

A 10-20% dip in blood pressure while you sleep is considered normal. 

Past studies show that not experiencing nocturnal dipping, or the reverse of it, known as nocturnal hypertension, can increase a person's risk for cardiovascular disease. 

When asked about his reaction to this study's findings, Chen commented that while the Mediterranean and keto diets are somewhat different in their food restrictions, the study results suggest that there may be different dietary techniques that can achieve the same beneficial outcome, depending on the food preferences of an individual.

“Metabolic syndrome — including high blood pressure, abdominal obesity, high blood sugar, and disordered lipids — remains a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease,” he explained. “Lifestyle modification, such as diet improvements, will be essential in order to help control the burden of heart disease in our society.”

“Further research including larger controlled studies with a more diverse population will be necessary to confirm these findings, and to evaluate for any potential benefit to clinical outcomes,” Chen added. 

MNT also spoke with Mir Ali, MD, a board certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon, and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this research, who commented that its findings are in line with what he recommends to patients. 

“Both the keto and the Mediterranean diets emphasize a reduction in carbohydrate and sugar intake, and that's what we found is the best way to kind of shift the body into burning fat is by reducing all the carbohydrates and sugars.”— Mir Ali, MD

“Unfortunately, obesity is an increasing problem in the U.S. and other westernized countries, so the more we can find ways to combat that, find foods that are going to help people lose weight and head to a healthier diet, then maybe some of these larger food manufacturers will start shifting their focus to foods that just taste good to foods that may actually be helpful,” Ali continued. 

Because this was a smaller study, Ali suggested expanding it to a larger patient base or population to refine it further. 

“What is it about these two types of diets that are helpful?,” he asked. “Is it reducing processed foods or is it more reducing the carbohydrates and sugars? So there are some differences between the diets, and trying to define further what is optimal between these two diets.” 

While both the Mediterranean and keto diets are popular dietary plans for people to follow, they may not be right for everyone. We asked Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, for her top tips for readers on how to decide which diet is personally best for them to follow if they want to lose weight and lower their blood pressure. 

“Meeting with a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) is recommended to further explore which dietary pattern may be most appropriate for an individual's needs, current health condition, preferences, goals, genetics and lifestyle,” Richard said. “RDNs are trained to bridge the gap between science and everyday life. If you're looking to manage weight or blood pressure in a way that's realistic and sustainable, working with an RDN can be a game-changer.” 

“It is also important to consider if the specific dietary pattern is sustainable for a long period of time and can be a lifestyle versus a controlled experiment or ‘temporary fix',” she continued. “Think of dietary patterns like a playlist — the right mix can set the tone for a healthier rhythm in your body and the days ahead.”

Richard suggested honing in on increasing foods rich in nutrients with many health benefits, such as:

“There's no ‘one-size-fits-all' when it comes to dietary patterns — unless it's a kitchen apron. I encourage clients and patients to try to move away from chasing labels —‘Mediterranean,' ‘low-carb,' ‘plant-based'— and move toward tuning into how food functions for our unique needs.”— Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN

Gene expression leading to alterations in the DNA caused by asbestos exposure may explain the development of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM), a rare and aggressive cancer. By analyzing public RNA-seq data through a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline, scientists working with the Sbarro Health Research Organization (SHRO) have developed an in-depth view of the molecular mechanisms involved in asbestos-induced carcinogenesis. The findings highlight both known and novel genes and pathways, providing valuable insights into the biological processes disrupted in exposed patients. This work contributes to ongoing efforts to define reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and lays the groundwork for future investigations and potential clinical applications in personalized approaches to MPM management.

The article, titled "From Asbestos Exposure to Carcinogenesis: Transcriptomic Signatures in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma," describes a new study investigating differential gene expression in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) associated with documented asbestos exposure, with the aim of identifying specific transcriptomic biomarkers that could support advances in precision medicine.

Published in Experimental and Molecular Pathology, the paper was a collaborative effort between teams led by Professor Antonio Giordano, M.D., Ph.D., Founder and Director of the SHRO and Professor at Temple University, and Professor Elisa Frullanti, Ph.D., Director of the Cancer Genomics & Systems Biology Lab and Professor of Genetics at the University of Siena. The study was conducted within the Med Biotech Hub and Competence Center at the University of Siena, in collaboration with the SHRO and the Sbarro Institute for Molecular Medicine and Cancer Research at Temple University. Funding was provided by the Italian National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work (INAIL) through the BRiC-INAIL 2022 program. Co-authors include Diletta Rosati, Bianca Giulia Maurizi, Viola Bianca Serio, Debora Maffeo, Angela Rina, Francesca Mari, and Maria Palmieri.

Using publicly available RNA sequencing datasets, the research team employed a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline to perform differential gene expression and functional enrichment analyses. The results identified a distinct set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in MPM patients with documented asbestos exposure. Many of these genes are involved in key biological processes such as ion homeostasis, oxidative stress response, and cellular component disorganization-hallmarks of asbestos-induced cellular damage that may play a role in tumor initiation and progression.

This is not just about cataloging genes. It's about constructing a molecular roadmap of asbestos-induced cancer development. With further validation, this could translate into real-world clinical applications."

Professor Elisa Frullanti, Ph.D., Director of the Cancer Genomics & Systems Biology Lab and Professor of Genetics at the University of Siena

The findings shed new light on the molecular mechanisms of MPM and offer a foundation for future research into predictive and prognostic biomarkers. By pinpointing specific transcriptomic changes, the study contributes to efforts in precision medicine and supports the development of improved diagnostic tools and potential therapeutic targets for this deadly disease.

"This type of precision medicine means that we are one step closer to identifying patients more likely to develop Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma," says Giordano, "and we are closer to developing potential treatments."

As the global incidence of mesothelioma continues to rise-due in part to the long latency period of asbestos exposure and ongoing environmental risks-this study represents a critical step toward more personalized and effective management strategies for patients.

Macrophages and other immune cells are the natural frontline immune warriors of our body, defending the body against invading pathogens and cancer cells. Yet despite their innate "combat" capabilities, precisely directing and activating these cells in vivo has remained challenging. In recent years, the emergence of bio-microrobots has shown great potential to convert these "natural soldiers" into controllable function units using external physical fields and biomimetic design. However, existing approaches typically rely on magnetic, acoustic or optical fields to drive cell movement, but hard to tuning their biological functions. Besides, these methods require exogenous material or genetic modification, raising serious biosafety and immune-rejection concerns.

In a new paper published in Light: Science & Applications, a team of scientists led by Professor Hongbao Xin from Jinan University, China, has developed a light-powered phagocytic macrophage microrobot ("Phagobot") that combines innate immune functions with robotic controllability. The phagobot can be "woken up" and navigated simply using a tightly focused near-infrared (NIR) light beam.

"We wanted to find a way to control immune cells with the same precision as machines, but without taking away their natural strengths," said Professor Xin, the study's corresponding author. "With this dual-mode optical control strategy, macrophages remain completely natural, yet they can be precisely instructed to move, seek, and phagocytosis of bio-threats both in vitro and in vivo."

The process begins with a tightly focused NIR laser beam (1064 nm) focusing on the surface of resting macrophages. Within a few minutes, the localized photothermal effect triggers temperature-sensitive ion channels in the cell membrane, causing calcium to rush into the cell. This chain reaction activates the cell's energy metabolism and leads to a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is a hallmark of macrophage activation. As a result, the macrophage transforms, extending flexible "arms" called pseudopodia, ready for action.

It's like flipping a biological switch with light. The light doesn't just move the cell. It turns the cell into a warrior."

Xing Li, the paper's first author and PhD student at Jinan University

The extended pseudopodia in activated macrophage can act like tiny antennae to sense changes in the extracellular microenvironment. Researchers used gentle optical forces to manipulate the pseudopodia, enabling precise directional control. In this way, the phagobot could be navigated toward target locations with high spatial accuracy. 

"Other bio-microrobots that rely on magnetic or acoustic fields to push entire cells, which may inevitably disturb cell activity and immune state. On contrast, this method works at the subcellular level, guiding only the pseudopodia. This keeps the rest of the cell undisturbed, mimicking how immune cells naturally migrate in tissue." Said the co-corresponding author, Associate Professor Ting Pan.

In laboratory tests, the phagobot showed remarkable efficiency in targeting and engulfing a variety of bio-threats, including Staphylococcus aureus, yeast cells, plastic nanoparticles, and tumor cell debris. The system also proved its power in vivo. Using zebrafish models, researchers labeled macrophages with fluorescent markers and successfully activated and navigated them in the complex, constantly moving gut environment. There, the phagobots located and cleared cellular debris without causing any visible tissue damage even after prolonged light exposure.

"This approach overcomes the two major bottlenecks in the field of bio-microrobots: external driving systems can only drive the cells to move and the need for synthetic or genetic modifications. It provides a non-genetic platform for in vivo immune intervention, offering promising applications in targeted therapy and precision immunomodulation," these scientists summarized.

The tear film coating the eye offers a window into a person's systemic and ocular health, carrying biomarkers such as glucose, electrolytes, and proteins. Yet, existing diagnostic approaches-like tonometry or tear sampling-are often invasive, infrequent, and impractical for daily monitoring. Likewise, standard eye drop treatments suffer from poor drug retention due to blinking and drainage, limiting their therapeutic impact. Smart contact lenses have emerged as a compelling alternative. By enabling real-time sensing and controlled drug release directly on the eye, they promise to revolutionize ophthalmic care. Still, incorporating delicate microfluidic features into the curved, flexible surface of soft lenses without compromising vision or comfort remains a formidable engineering challenge. Addressing these barriers calls for continued innovation in fabrication methods and material integration.

In a comprehensive review (DOI: 10.1038/s41378-025-00909-3) published April 3, 2025, in Microsystems & Nanoengineering, researchers from the Manipal Institute of Applied Physics and Manipal University Jaipur chart the evolution of Microfluidic contact lenses (MCLs) from concept to clinical possibility. The article examines how fabrication advances-spanning soft lithography, laser patterning, and 3D-printed mold replication-are enabling lenses to measure intraocular pressure, detect biochemical markers, and deliver medication on demand. With these capabilities, contact lenses are poised to become an all-in-one platform for diagnosis, therapy, and patient comfort.

The review highlights two core applications for MCLs: sensing and treatment. For diagnostics, deformable microchannels embedded in the lens respond to pressure changes by shifting indicator fluids, enabling accurate intraocular pressure measurements-crucial for glaucoma management. Some designs have achieved sensitivities up to 708 μm/mmHg, far surpassing earlier iterations. MCLs also track tear biomarkers such as pH, glucose, lactate, and proteins via smartphone-readable colorimetric or fluorescent sensors. On the therapeutic front, drug-loaded microchambers release medication in response to external cues like magnets or electrical signals-or internal ones like pH shifts or blinking pressure. These innovations allow for on-demand delivery while maintaining the optical clarity and flexibility of the lens. Fabrication methods underpin this progress: thermoforming and PDMS replication deliver precision; 3D printing allows for personalized designs; and femtosecond lasers offer ultra-fine microchannel engraving. Though scalable production remains a challenge, these technologies are steadily converging on practical, patient-ready solutions.

MCLs represent a convergence of vision care and advanced diagnostics. Our goal is to create a single, wearable device that seamlessly combines biosensing, therapeutic delivery, and user comfort. Many of these technologies are still in development, but the progress in fabrication and materials is encouraging. We're moving closer to clinical translation."

Prof. Sajan D. George, the review's corresponding author

The future of MCLs extends far beyond the ophthalmologist's office. In healthcare, they offer transformative potential for managing chronic eye conditions like glaucoma and dry eye syndrome, while also treating diseases such as diabetic retinopathy through localized, sustained drug delivery. Paired with mobile interfaces, they enable remote diagnostics and personalized treatment. Outside medicine, the integration of sensors, drug systems, and even display technologies hints at applications in sports, military, and wearable tech. To fully realize these possibilities, further advancements in scalable manufacturing, regulatory compliance, and long-term safety will be key. But one thing is certain: smart lenses are rapidly transitioning from laboratory prototypes to real-world tools in precision health.

Four leading organizations in lifestyle medicine, obesity medicine, and nutrition-the American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM), the American Society for Nutrition (ASN), the Obesity Medicine Association (OMA), and The Obesity Society (TOS)-have jointly released a clinical advisory titled "Nutritional Priorities to Support GLP-1 Therapy for Obesity." Published across four peer-reviewed journals, this consensus-based guidance reflects an interdisciplinary collaboration to help clinicians support patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists for obesity care with evidence-based nutritional and behavioral strategies.

GLP-1 therapies, including both single and combination agents, have emerged as powerful tools in the management of obesity, demonstrating average placebo-adjusted weight reductions of 5–18% in clinical trials, along with improvements in metabolic, functional and cardiovascular outcomes. However, sustaining these benefits over time and maximizing patient outcomes require comprehensive care that integrates lifestyle intervention-particularly nutrition therapy-into the treatment plan.

"GLP-1s represent an important advancement in obesity care," said lead author and advisory chair Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, DrPH, of Tufts University. "But these medications can present challenges, including gastrointestinal side effects, risk of micronutrient deficiencies, muscle and bone loss, poor long-term adherence with subsequent weight regain, and high costs; and, on their own, are not enough. Nutrition therapy and lifestyle support are essential components to address these challenges, help patients maximize and maintain health gains over time, and ensure we are using these drugs wisely, effectively, and without bankrupting the healthcare system."

The advisory outlines eight key nutritional priorities to support patients on GLP-1 medications, emphasizing the importance of (1) patient-centered initiation of therapy, (2) careful baseline nutritional assessment, (3) management of gastrointestinal side effects, (4) personalized, nutrient-dense, minimally processed diets, (5) prevention of micronutrient deficiencies (6) adequate protein intake and strength training to preserve lean mass, (7) leveraging a good diet to maximize weight reduction, and (8) promoting other lifestyle changes around activity, sleep, mental stress, substance use, and social connections to maximize long-term success.

Recent evidence supports this integrative model. In studies evaluating combined pharmacologic and lifestyle interventions, patients receiving both GLP-1 therapy and structured nutrition guidance achieved greater weight loss, better adherence, and were more likely to sustain weight loss after discontinuing medication compared to those receiving pharmacotherapy alone (Wadden et al., 2021; Kushner et al., 2022).

Despite the known benefits, most individuals prescribed GLP-1s do not currently receive adequate nutritional counseling or behavioral support. This advisory seeks to fill that gap with practical, interdisciplinary guidance for implementation in clinical practice.

GLP-1s are reshaping the landscape of obesity treatment, but it's clear that medication alone is not a complete solution. This consensus-based guidance highlights the critical role of nutrition in supporting patients on GLP-1 therapy, with clear recommendations for health care providers to optimize outcomes, reduce risks, and fill urgent gaps in care through practical, evidence-informed nutrition strategies."

John E. Courtney, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of the American Society for Nutrition

While certain considerations-such as GI tolerance and micronutrient balance-are important for clinicians to address, the advisory emphasizes that a proactive lifestyle-based approach can mitigate risks and optimize outcomes. With obesity prevalence continuing to rise worldwide, the integration of nutrition therapy into GLP-1-based care offers a scalable strategy to extend the clinical and economic value of these therapies.

Clinicians are encouraged to use the advisory's tools and frameworks to help patients translate nutrition guidance into sustainable behaviors, making lifestyle medicine an active ingredient in every "prescription" for obesity care.

The joint advisory is simultaneously published in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM), The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (ASN), Obesity Pillars® (OMA) and Obesity (TOS). Leading researchers will discuss the advisory and its implications during two sessions at NUTRITION 2025, the flagship annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition to be held May 31–June 3 in Orlando, Florida:

In patients with diabetic foot ulcers that looked healed and met the current definition of a closed wound, closed ulcers with functionally defective skin that lost more body water were likely to re-open, according to a new National Institutes of Health (NIH) Diabetic Foot Consortium study, led by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and published today in Diabetes Care.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently defines a closed wound as one where the surface is completely covered by new skin and has not had any discharge or drainage for two consecutive weeks.

But when it comes to wound healing, looks can be deceiving.

A wound that meets the FDA's criteria of wound closure appears to be healed, but it may not be functionally closed. The skin may not be doing its job of providing a barrier to the outside world: The covering is there, but the covering doesn't work, so it's vulnerable to bacteria, dirt and allergens entering the body. We call these invisible wounds."

Chandan Sen, Ph.D., co-lead author, professor in the Department of Surgery at Pitt, director of the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine and chief scientific officer of Wound Healing Services at UPMC

However, invisible wounds have a telltale sign: more moisture evaporates through this compromised barrier compared with healthy skin. This can be detected with a simple handheld point-of-care device that measures trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL).

"Diabetic foot ulcers are a major complication among patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. These wounds heal slowly and have high rates of recurrence, which often leads to amputation and death," said Sen. "Our research shows that high TEWL of closed wounds, marking defective barrier function of the skin, is followed by wound recurrence."

The new findings suggest that restoration of skin barrier functionality should be incorporated into the existing definition of wound closure to ensure durable wound closure and to better identify patients at risk of wound recurrence.

Across seven U.S. study sites of the NIH Diabetic Foot Consortium, the researchers - led by Sen, Gayle Gordillo, M.D., and Sashwati Roy, Ph.D., M.S. - recruited 418 adult participants with type 1 or 2 diabetes and who had a recently healed diabetic foot ulcer. Using a handheld device, they collected baseline TEWL measurements from the closed wound sites and then followed these patients for up to 16 weeks to check for wound recurrence.

Of the 368 participants who completed the study, 79, or 22%, had wounds that reopened by week 16. Baseline TEWL values were higher for wounds that would go on to reopen than for those that remained closed.

Further analysis identified that patients with high TEWL values - greater than 30 - were about 2.7 times more likely to have the wound reopen compared to those with lower TEWL levels. Time to recurrence was also shorter in wounds with high TEWL.

"Our study suggests that a TEWL of 30 in a healed wound should be considered a red flag for recurrence," said Gordillo, professor of plastic surgery at Pitt and senior medical director of UPMC Wound Healing Services. "Even though these wounds may look closed, the barrier is defective, so these invisible wounds deserve further care."

According to Sen, measuring TEWL as part of standard practice for assessing wound closure could lead to better outcomes for patients with diabetic foot ulcers and other types of wounds.

"This study is an important initial step to give clinicians treating diabetic foot ulcers a reliable diagnostic aid for the first time to assess an individual's risk of ulcer recurrence," said Teresa Jones, M.D. program director for the Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology, & Metabolic Diseases at NIH's National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). "Foot ulcers are such a confounding issue with diabetes and being able to determine which wounds are at highest risk for recurrence could save many lives and limbs."

New research has found that men who carry a common genetic variant are twice as likely to develop dementia in their lifetime compared to women.

The research, published in Neurology, used data from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial to investigate whether people who had variants in the haemochromatosis (HFE) gene, which is critical for regulating iron levels in the body, might be at increased risk of dementia.

Co-author Professor John Olynyk, from the Curtin Medical School, said one in three people carry one copy of the variant, known as H63D, while one in 36 carry two copies.

Having just one copy of this gene variant does not impact someone's health or increase their risk of dementia. However, having two copies of the variant more than doubled the risk of dementia in men, but not women.

While the genetic variant itself cannot be changed, the brain pathways which it affects – leading to the damage that causes dementia – could potentially be treated if we understood more about it."

Professor John Olynyk, Curtin Medical School

Professor Olynyk said further research was needed to investigate why this genetic variant increased the risk of dementia for males but not females.

"The HFE gene is routinely tested for in most Western countries including Australia when assessing people for haemochromatosis – a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron. Our findings suggest that perhaps this testing could be offered to men more broadly," Professor Olynyk said.

"While the HFE gene is critical for controlling iron levels in the body, we found no direct link between iron levels in the blood and increased dementia risk in affected men.

"This points to other mechanisms at play, possibly involving the increased risk of brain injury from inflammation and cell damage in the body."

Co-author Professor Paul Lacaze, from Monash University, said the findings could help improve outcomes for people at risk of developing dementia.

"More than 400,000 Australians are currently living with dementia, with around a third of those being men. Understanding why men with the double H63D variant are at higher risk could pave the way for more personalised approaches to prevention and treatment," Professor Lacaze said.

"This study is a great example of how diverse Australian research groups and universities can collaborate effectively to learn more about these progressive diseases and ultimately improve health outcomes for people around the world."

The ASPREE trial was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of daily low-aspirin in 19,114 healthy older people in Australia and the USA. Primarily undertaken to evaluate the risks versus benefits of daily low-dose aspirin in this cohort, it created a treasure trove of healthy ageing data that has underpinned a wealth of research studies.

The research was a collaboration between Curtin University, Monash University, The University of Melbourne, The Royal Children's Hospital, Murdoch Children's Research Institute and Fiona Stanley Hospital.

Prevailing theories about why young people experience psychotic breaks at a young age rely on individual factors like exposure to child abuse, school bullying, or drugs.

But a new study from the NYU Silver School of Social Work suggests that broader social factors, such as racial inequality and experience with police violence, might contribute to the proportionately higher rates of psychosis seen among low-income young adults of color.

The study, "Social Defeat and Psychosis in the United States," was published today by Schizophrenia Bulletin and authored by NYU Silver associate professor Jordan DeVylder and doctoral students Jacqueline Cosse and Brianna Amos.

The researchers culled the National Survey of Poly-Victimization and Mental Health to explore individual-level and societal, or structural, impacts on early psychosis risk. The sample included 1,584 U.S. participants aged 18-29.

Among the respondents, Blacks, Latinos, multiracial, and Indigenous respondents had 60% higher odds of reporting having experienced one or more psychotic episodes in the prior year compared to white respondents, the study determined.

Furthermore, those who cited an experience involving police violence in had 52% higher odds of reporting one or more delusional or hallucinatory episode in the prior year.

The most widely recognized risk factors for psychosis are spelled out in the "Social Defeat Hypothesis," an influential theoretical framework used by psychiatrists to treat young adults with psychosis. While the social defeat hypothesis frames risk factors around the impact on the individual, the study shifts the focus to take in account social systems and structural factors.

In the study's analysis of the U.S. survey, an individual's sense of "social defeat" can indeed result in psychotic symptoms and can arise from a high frequency of substance use or exposure to bullying, as the theory holds. But the persistence of racial inequality, and related experiences such as exposure to police violence, could also be relevant factors, according to the study. It calls for research into the impact of societal factors that are more prominent in low-income and marginalized communities.

Developed in Northern Europe, the "Social Defeat Hypothesis" has been used by U.S. psychiatrists for over two decades to understand the development of psychosis, a condition that could show a young adult to be at higher risk of suicidal thinking or even schizophrenia.

Under the hypothesis, social defeats, like feeling humiliated, contribute to long-term neurobiological shifts in the brain and dopamine system especially, and are part of what may bring on instances in which an individual loses touch with reality. 

In conducting the study, DeVylder, Cosse, and Amos collaborated extensively with fellow social work scholar Lisa Fedina of the University of Michigan, as well as additional NYU Silver doctoral students.

Commenting on findings' significance, DeVylder said that structural factors may exert a "substantial" influence on an individual risk for psychosis, and could potentially help explain ethno-racial disparities in psychosis in the U.S.

This potentially means that reducing exposure to systemic factors, like societal racism, may provide mental health benefits similar to individual-focused interventions, like psychotherapy."

This study investigates upper gastrointestinal tract (UGIT) involvement in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), a condition traditionally considered limited to the colon. Although extra-colonic manifestations of UC are well recognized, UGIT issues have received less attention. This research aimed to document the clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological UGIT findings in adults with UC and assess their association with disease severity and extent.

This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at Ain Shams University over one year. A total of 78 UC patients underwent comprehensive clinical evaluations, including assessments of gastrointestinal complaints, medication history, disease progression, surgeries, and physical examinations. Endoscopic assessments of both the UGIT and colon were performed, accompanied by biopsies for histopathological analysis.

The study population had a mean age of 35.26 years, with a nearly equal gender distribution. Endoscopic findings revealed significant UGIT involvement: 64% of patients had esophagitis and/or gastroesophageal reflux disease, 93% had gastritis, and 80% had duodenitis. Histopathological findings showed notable inflammation, basal cell hyperplasia, and ulcerations in the esophagus, with 51.3% of patients exhibiting chronic gastritis and 38.5% testing positive for Helicobacter pylori infection. Statistical analysis demonstrated a strong association between colonic disease severity and UGIT endoscopic (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.001 in the esophagus and stomach, respectively) and histopathological (p < 0.004, p < 0.001, and p <0.005 in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, respectively) findings, particularly in patients with UGIT symptoms.

The current study concluded that endoscopic and histopathological changes in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenal mucosa are common in Egyptian UC patients. The study has established an association between UC and the endoscopic and histopathological findings in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. We recommend conducting a UGIT endoscopy examination for UC patients to diagnose any present UGIT lesions. The results of this study provide a rationale for conducting multicenter controlled studies with a larger number of Egyptian UC patients to confirm these findings.

Emerging theories suggest that communication challenges arise from differing perspectives between autistic and non-autistic partners rather than individual socio-cognitive deficits. In addition, while social behavior varies between cultures, observations from Western cultures dominate our understanding of autism. Researchers from Japan and the UK have conducted a cross-cultural analysis comparing the mentalizing performance of British and Japanese autistic and non-autistic adults. Their study highlights the need for more culturally sensitive socio-cognitive measures to assess autistic traits.

Autism spectrum disorders are associated with difficulties in social communication, long attributed to individual socio-cognitive deficits. As a consequence of this perspective, stigma and pressure to conform to neurotypical social norms often lead to mental health challenges among autistic individuals. Emerging theories suggest that communication difficulties may rather arise from mismatches in perspectives between autistic and non-autistic partners. Addressing this mismatch collaboratively could transform the understanding of autism and improve communication outcomes.

Social behavior also varies significantly across cultures. Gestures, eye contact, and body language that are considered appropriate in one culture may be perceived differently in another. Nevertheless, current socio-cognitive assessments largely reflect Western norms, limiting their applicability to non-Western populations.

To bridge this gap, researchers from Japan conducted a cross-cultural analysis to compare mentalizing difficulties, or challenges in understanding the thoughts and feelings of others, in British and Japanese autistic and non-autistic adults. Led by Dr. Bianca Schuster, a researcher at Waseda University, Japan, with co-authors Associate Professor Yuko Okamoto and Professor Rieko Osu from Waseda University, Professor Hirotaka Kosaka from the University of Fukui, and Dr. Masakazu Ide from the National Rehabilitation Center for Persons With Disabilities, the study highlights the importance of considering neurodivergent perspectives rather than attributing difficulties solely to autistic individuals.

Explaining the rationale behind their work, Dr. Schuster says, "Autistic and non-autistic people have different experiences and therefore perceive and interact with the world differently. Such a mismatch in perspectives can lead to difficulties in understanding each other's respective social cues – a problem termed the 'double empathy problem.' This theory has received a lot of attention in recent years, but there are still very few studies that have formally tested it." Their findings were published in Volume 16 of Molecular Autism on May 14, 2025.

The researchers used animations showing social scenes, depicted by moving triangles, and asked participants to interpret what was happening. They found that non-autistic British adults struggled to interpret animations created by their autistic peers. In contrast, British autistic adults demonstrated similar performances when interpreting animations made by both autistic and non-autistic people. The fact that British autistic adults did not perform better with animations made by their own neurotype may reflect that, in comparison to neurotypical groups, the perspectives of British neurodivergent individuals may be too varied.

Conversely, Japanese autistic and non-autistic adults interpreted animations created by their own and the respective other group with comparable accuracy. Notably, cross-cultural analyses revealed that while there was no difference in performance between Japanese and British non-autistic adults, Japanese autistic participants outperformed both groups of British participants. In addition, animations created by Japanese autistic adults were interpreted with higher accuracy by all autistic participants. Nevertheless, motor performance was comparable across all participants.

Overall, these findings support a paradigm shift toward treating autism as a different way of experiencing and interpreting the world, while recognizing it as a social disability shaped by challenges within a predominantly neurotypical environment. An inclusive environment that values socially diverse behaviors can support autistic individuals and enhance their mental well-being. Furthermore, the observed results do not likely mean that Japanese people are better at mentalizing than British individuals, because real-world difficulties in communication and social understanding do exist between autistic and non-autistic people in Japan, too. Instead, the findings may indicate that the task used in the current study may not be sensitive enough to detect mentalizing differences in the Japanese culture, highlighting the need to develop more culturally sensitive research and diagnostic tools.

"Cultural differences related to the diagnosis of autism may be subtle but can still lead to misclassification of cases and therefore have a significant impact on the lives of individuals. The results of this study highlight the urgent need for culturally inclusive research and the development of diagnostic criteria and tools that accurately reflect and respect the diverse manifestations of autism in different cultural contexts." Dr. Schuster adds.

Researchers at the Ragon Institute have made a significant discovery about how antibodies can directly enhance the body's ability to fight Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis (TB). Despite decades of research, TB remains one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide, with about 10 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths annually. Currently, there is no highly effective vaccine, highlighting the urgent need for new insights and treatments.

In a study published today in Immunity, Ragon faculty member Galit Alter, PhD and previous post-doctoral trainee Patricia Grace, PhD, now at University of Pittsburgh, partnered with Bryan Bryson, PhD, associate member Sarah Fortune, PhD and a team of collaborators, to collect the largest library of monoclonal antibodies to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) the bacteria that causes Tuberculosis. The team identified specific antibody features that significantly limit the growth of Mtb. This research reveals critical new insights into how antibodies interact with immune cells in the lungs to restrict Mtb infection, laying the groundwork for potential antibody-based therapies or vaccines against tuberculosis, both of which are urgently needed.

The team investigated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), highly specialized antibodies engineered to target specific components of Mtb. They screened a broad library of these antibodies, targeting many different components of the bacteria, to determine which could effectively reduce bacterial growth in infected mice. They found that particular antibodies targeting different parts of the bacteria-both surface proteins and internal antigens-could effectively restrict Mtb growth, challenging previous assumptions that only antibodies recognizing surface structures could help fight TB.

To better understand the mechanisms behind this antibody-mediated protection, researchers closely examined one particularly effective antibody targeting a molecule called lipoarabinomannan (LAM), found on the bacterial cell surface. By engineering the antibody constant domain (Fc), to control the killing activities of the antibody, the researchers discovered that maximal bacterial control was achieved when antibodies redirected innate immune cell recruitment and activation. Particularly, antibodies able to redirect the bacteria to neutrophils provided the greatest level of protection.

This discovery highlights a previously unrecognized way antibodies can work against TB not merely by neutralizing pathogens directly, but by reshaping immune cell functions within infected tissues. Given the rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria, understanding these immune mechanisms opens new avenues for novel therapeutic and vaccine design that are urgently needed to combat TB. Moreover, this study unlocks future approaches to rapidly discover and design monoclonal therapeutics to a broader array of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the future.

Heart attacks are the leading cause of death globally, yet some statistics from many different countries suggest these events declined in frequency since the COVID-19 pandemic. Mass General Brigham researchers evaluated whether these cardiac trends reflect a true change in event rates, or if they reflect that more people are dying at home rather than in hospitals. Their findings highlight potential shortcomings of cardiac care during and in the years following the height of the pandemic, suggesting opportunities to better treat and prevent cardiac events in people at risk. The study published today in JAMA Network Open. 

Lots of reports have shown that there have been fewer heart attacks in hospitals since 2020-but something seems to be missing from that data. We now show that if you account for deaths at home, cardiac deaths are going up and have stayed up for years. Today there are a lot more people having cardiac deaths at home, which also raises the concern that people with heart disease haven't been getting the care they need since the pandemic."

Jason H. Wasfy, MD, MPhil, corresponding author, director of Outcomes Research at the at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cardiology Division and faculty member at the Mongan Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital

The researchers looked at death certificate data from 127,746 people who died in Massachusetts and found cardiac deaths exceeded anticipated levels between 2020 and 2023. Using data from 2014 to 2019, the team set an expected cardiac death rate to compare the new 2020 to 2023 rate against. Cardiac deaths were 16% higher than expected in 2020, 17% higher in 2021 and 2022, and 6% higher in 2023. Notably, this significant increase in cardiac deaths happened despite lower cardiac-related hospital admissions, meaning more deaths occurred at home.

"Healthcare systems around the world have experienced multiple shocks since 2020. Our findings suggest that both patient choices about seeking care and outcomes after experiencing a cardiac emergency also have changed," said senior author John Hsu, MD, MBA, MSCE, faculty member and director of the Program for Clinical Economics and Policy Analysis at the Mongan Institute at MGH. "Had we not examined mortality using death certificate data, the increases in population cardiac mortality could have gone unnoticed."

Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) published its first-ever position paper on immunization products to protect infants against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) – the leading cause of acute lower respiratory infections in children globally.

Every year, RSV causes about 100 000 deaths and over 3.6 million hospitalizations in children under the age of 5 years worldwide. About half of these deaths occur in infants younger than 6 months of age. The vast majority (97%) of RSV deaths in infants occur in low- and middle-income countries where there is limited access to supportive medical care, such as oxygen or hydration.

Published in the Weekly Epidemiological Record (WER), the position paper outlines WHO recommendations for two immunization products: a maternal vaccine that can be given to pregnant women in their third trimester to protect their infant and a long-acting monoclonal antibody that can be administered to infants from birth, just before or during the RSV season.

RSV is an incredibly infectious virus that infects people of all ages, but is especially harmful to infants, particularly those born premature, when they are most vulnerable to severe disease. The WHO-recommended RSV immunization products can transform the fight against severe RSV disease, dramatically reduce hospitalizations, and deaths, ultimately saving many infant lives globally."

Dr. Kate O'Brien, Director of Immunization, Vaccines, and Biologicals at WHO

RSV usually causes mild symptoms similar to the common cold, including runny nose, cough and fever. However, it can lead to serious complications – including pneumonia and bronchiolitis – in infants, young children, older adults and those with compromised immune systems or underlying health conditions.

In response to the global burden of severe RSV disease among infants, WHO recommends that all countries introduce either the maternal vaccine, RSVpreF, or the monoclonal antibody, nirsevimab depending on the feasibility of implementation within each country's existing health system, cost-effectiveness and anticipated coverage. Both products were recommended by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) for global implementation in September 2024. In addition, the maternal vaccine received WHO prequalification in March 2025, allowing it to be purchased by UN agencies.

WHO recommends that the maternal vaccine be given to pregnant women during the third trimester of pregnancy, from week 28 onwards, to optimize for the adequate transfer of antibodies to their baby. The vaccine may be given during routine antenatal care, including at one of the 5 WHO-recommended antenatal care visits in the third trimester or any additional medical consultations.

The second WHO-recommended immunization product, nirsevimab, is given as a single injection of monoclonal antibodies that starts protecting babies against RSV within a week of administration and lasts for at least 5 months, which can cover the entire RSV season in countries with RSV seasonality.

WHO recommends that infants receive a single dose of nirsevimab right after birth or before being discharged from a birthing facility. If not administered at birth, the monoclonal antibody can be given during the baby's first health visit. If a country decides to administer the product only during the RSV season rather than year-round, a single dose can also be given to older infants just before entering their first RSV season.

The greatest impact on severe RSV disease will be achieved by administering the monoclonal antibody to infants under 6 months of age. However, there is still a potential benefit among infants up to 12 months of age.

WHO regularly issues updated position papers on vaccines, combinations of vaccines and other immunization products against diseases that have major public health impact. These papers focus primarily on the use of vaccines in large-scale vaccination programmes. The new position paper aims to inform national public health policymakers and immunization programme managers on the use of RSV immunization products in their national programmes, as well as national and international funding agencies.

A new study by investigators from Mass General Brigham showed that a new app they created can help improve the quality of life for caregivers of patients undergoing bone marrow transplant (BMT). The researchers conducted a randomized clinical trial and found that caregivers assigned to use the app showed significantly greater improvements in quality of life, burden, and mood symptoms compared to those who did not have the app. They detailed their findings in a presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting and a paper simultaneously published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

Family and friends who care for patients getting a bone marrow transplant struggle with depression and anxiety at high rates. Their heavy caregiving burden often leads to lower quality of life. The challenges of caregiving can significantly disrupt their employment, role in the household, and personal lives. This app is designed to help address their needs."

Jamie Jacobs, PhD, co-principal investigator of the study, program director of Psychiatric Oncology and director of Caregiving Research at the Cancer Outcomes Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital

Jacobs co-developed the app with Areej El-Jawahri, MD, co-director of the Cancer Outcomes Research and Education Program and director of the Bone Marrow Transplant Survivorship Program at MGH. Together, they created a one-on-one supportive counseling program called BMT-CARE, which they had previously shown can increase caregiver quality of life. But to better scale the strategy, they created a virtual version of the therapy as an app called the BMT-CARE App.

The app offers educational modules, games, and videos grounded in evidence-based psychological techniques that support the caregiver through each stage of the process - before, during, and after the transplant. The trial testing of the app included 125 caregivers, half of whom received the app in addition to the usual supportive care services. The caregivers spent a median of 146.9 minutes using the app. Compared to those who received only standard services, the group using the app had a higher quality of life, lower caregiving burden, and fewer symptoms of depression and PTSD at 60 days after transplant.

"The BMT-CARE App may be an accessible option for much-needed support for overwhelmed caregivers who don't have the time, money or energy to access mental health services," said Jacobs.

The researchers are expanding the testing of the BMT-CARE App across multiple centers and with diverse caregiver populations.

NIH-funded project shows that trans-epidermal water loss could indicate if wounds are fully healed.

A research team funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has identified a diagnostic aid that has the potential to accurately predict the recurrence of diabetic foot ulcers that appear to be fully healed. By measuring the skin's barrier function through a process known as trans-epidermal water loss, or TEWL, scientists were able to determine which wounds were more likely to reopen. TEWL measurements are a major factor in burn care, where deep layers of the skin are often damaged. The findings suggest that full restoration of skin barrier function should be incorporated into existing wound treatment standards to ensure complete wound closure and to better identify patients at risk of wound recurrence.

This study is an important initial step to give clinicians treating diabetic foot ulcers a reliable diagnostic aid for the first time to assess an individual's risk of ulcer recurrence. Foot ulcers are such a confounding issue with diabetes and being able to determine which wounds are at highest risk for recurrence could save many lives and limbs."  

Teresa Jones, M.D. program director, Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology, & Metabolic Diseases, NIH's National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)

Scientists, working together through the NIDDK Diabetic Foot Consortium, evaluated over 400 study participants who had a diabetic foot ulcer that visually appeared to be closed or healed. They measured TEWL at the site of the foot ulcer and found that 35% of participants with high TEWL (more water loss) reported a wound recurrence by 16 weeks, compared to just 17% for those with low TEWL (less water loss). Participants with higher TEWL were 2.7 times more likely to experience a wound recurrence than participants with low TEWL.

Diabetic foot ulcers are a major complication of diabetes where a break in the skin of the foot is often unnoticed by a patient due to nerve damage, known as neuropathy. They are the leading cause of non-traumatic lower-limb amputations, and untreated or unhealed ulcers significantly increase the risk of death. Wounds that appear to be healed on the surface may not be fully closed below the superficial surface of the skin, hampering the effectiveness of the skin's barrier function to keep in water and keep out pathogens, such as bacteria.

Study results will publish in Diabetes Care, a journal of the American Diabetes Association. The study was funded by NIH/NIDDK grants (U01DK119099, U24DK122927, U01DK119100, U01DK119083, U01DK119094, U01DK119085 and U01DK119102) and carried out by members of NIH's Diabetic Foot Consortium.

On Saturday night, the USWNT and China will meet in a women's soccer friendly in Saint Paul, Minnesota, with the USA team looking to bounce back after a loss in its most recent friendly.

Will the United States bounce back against China? Tune in to NBC Universo to watch the action.

The USWNT is coming off a 2-1 loss to Brazil in a friendly back in April, the second loss in the last three matches for the team. Catarina Macario scored in the first minute of the game as it looked the US would roll, but that goal was all the team managed in the match.

The loss represented the first time the USWNT had lost two times in three tries since its three-game losing streak to England, Spain, and Germany back in 2022.

Meanwhile, China is coming off back-to-back wins in April in the Yongchuan International Tournament, beating Uzbekistan 5-0 and Thailand 5-1. The team has won three of its first matches in 2025, beating Chinese Taipei, losing to Mexico, and drawing with Canada, all during the Pinatar Cup.

These teams last met in December 2023, playing a pair of games. The USWNT won both, taking 3-0 and 2-1 victories.

ALAJUELA, Costa Rica – The U.S. U-20 Women's National Team opened Group A play at the Concacaf Women's U-20 Championship with a convincing 8-0 win over Guyana.

Forward Izzy Engle led the team with four goals, becoming the eighth player in team history to score four goals in a U-20 Concacaf Championship match. Midfielder Kennedy Fuller also had a standout performance, converting a penalty kick and providing three assists.

The USA will now face Puerto Rico (June 1 at 1 p.m. ET on FS1) and Costa Rica (April 3 at 4 p.m. ET on FS2) with two more wins guaranteeing the USA a spot in the 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup.

The USA wasted little time getting on the score sheet. In the fifth minute, defender Aven Alvarez, the only player on the U.S. side with U-20caps coming into the match, slipped a pass to Fuller, who juked around her defender into open space five yards outside the penalty box and ripped a shot that smacked the right post. The rebound fell right to Engle, who easily converted the first goal of the match.

Fuller would get her goal in the 13th minute after converting a penalty kick. Engle drew the foul in the box when her defender slid across her body and took her down while fighting for the ball in the box.

Then came the first of two Fuller-to-Engle connections. In the 24th minute, Fuller sent an in-swinging cross toward the back post and found the head of Engle, who calmly redirected the ball past the diving ‘keeper to make it 3-0.

One minute after the Engle set piece goal, midfielder Linda Ullmark drove down the left channel, then cut around her defender toward the box before sending a centering pass into the middle. Midfielder Sealey Strawn got to the end of the pass and snuck the ball inside the left post on her first touch to make it 4-0.

Ullmark then made it 5-0 in the 37th minute. After receiving a pass from Fuller on the left side of the box, Ullmar kturned and fired a right-footed strike from about ten yards away to beat the ‘keeper into the bottom right corner of the goal.

Engle bookended the six-goal first half in the 41st minute. With the ball at her feet and between two defenders, Engle danced around her opponents to give herself space at the top of the box and then stung a shot into the top right corner of the net to close the half with three goals and a 6-0 lead.

Just two minutes into the second half, Engle notched her fourth goal of the match. Fuller assisted her for the second time of the match, slipping a pass through the defender to get Engle who was charging into the box. The forward cut her shot across her body and placed the ball inside the far-right post to make it 7-0.

Midfielder Emma Johnson finished off the USA scoring in the 78th minute. Defender Kate Scott ripped a shot from just outside of the top of the box and forced the Guyanese ‘keeper into a diving save. But the rebound fell right to Johnson, who calmly finished to give the U.S. the 8-0 lead.

The USA outshot Guyana 34-2 and did not allow a shot on goal.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. – Lionel Messi and Inter Miami will play their final match before the FIFA Club World Cup on Saturday night against the Columbus Crew at Chase Stadium.

Messi has scored three goals in his last two matches, and is expected to play against Columbus. His status will be confirmed when Inter Miami announces its starting lineup an hour before the match.

Columbus Crew and Inter Miami have been two of the best clubs in Major League Soccer in recent years, but both are struggling in 2025.

Inter Miami has just two wins in its last 10 games – They beat the Crew 1-0 in Cleveland on April 19, and beat CF Montreal 4-2 last Wednesday. Columbus has four wins, four draws and two losses in its last 10 matches.

Columbus Crew won MLS Cup title in 2023, and Inter Miami beat Columbus to win the MLS Supporters' Shield in 2024. Both clubs also won the Leagues Cup tournaments – Inter Miami in 2023, and Columbus in 2024.

After the Columbus match, Messi will re-join the Argentine national team for two World Cup qualifiers, before Inter Miami enters the Club World Cup.

Here's everything you need to know about the Inter Miami vs. Columbus Crew match, and stay tuned here for live updates from USA TODAY Sports:

The match begins Saturday night at 7:30 p.m. ET (8:30 p.m. in Argentina) inside Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

The match is available to live stream on MLS Season Pass via Apple TV.

Messi is expected to play, but his status will be confirmed when Inter Miami announces its starting lineup an hour before the match.

Inter Miami is the favorite to win at home (+105), while Columbus Crew is an underdog on the road (+195), and a draw has longer odds (+290) than an outright victory. The over/under is set at 3.5 goals, according to BETMGM.

Inter Miami has won three of its last four matches against Columbus Crew.

The match is an unofficial start to another busy summer for Messi – the Argentine World Cup champion and eight-time Ballon d'Or winner – in the twilight of his legendary career in the United States.

Here's what's next for Messi after the Columbus match:

Erling Haaland appears to be making the most of his brief time off this summer after enduring a nightmare campaign with Manchester City.

The no-nonsense striker brutally admitted he and his team-mates were not 'good enough' as they went trophyless for the first time in eight years and surrendered the Premier League title to rivals Liverpool, finishing in third. 

City also endured disappointment in the Champions League, having crashed out in the last-16 to Real Madrid, leading Pep Guardiola to return to the drawing board.

Already in the middle of refreshing his squad, Guardiola will shortly take his players to the United States for the new-look Club World Cup, which begins on June 15. 

They won 2-0 at Fulham on the last day of the season to secure a spot at the top table in Europe but will return to action just 24 days later. 

Enjoying a breather before hopping on board City's flight out, Haaland took to social media to share a photo of himself holding two large lobsters.

Erling Haaland appears to be making the most of his downtime ahead of the Club World Cup

Haaland endured a disappointing campaign as City went without a major trophy

But the ace will soon be jetting out to the United States with the rest of Pep Guardiola's squad

The simple caption read: 'Lobzter'.

Haaland is now back fit and firing after recovering from an ankle injury sustained in the 2-1 victory over Bournemouth in March, but he was powerless to prevent City from losing the FA Cup final against Crystal Palace at Wembley.

He was on target at Craven Cottage, however, and will hope to find the back of the net again as City target another Club World Cup triumph, having won it back in 2023. 

In the new-look edition, City will play Moroccan side Wydad AC on 18 June, Al Ain from the United Arab Emirates on 23 June and finally Juventus three days later. 

The top two teams from each of the eight groups will qualify for the knockout stages while the sides that reach the final on 13 July will have played seven games.

Exactly a month later, the new Premier League season will get underway.

Despite the gruelling schedule awaiting City's players, club chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak has insisted the squad will be 'hungry' for silverware in the United States.

Al Mubarak said: 'They want to come back, and they want to come back hungry. I can see the hunger and these players, they want to come back to pre-season.

Haaland was powerless to prevent City from losing the FA Cup final to Crystal Palace

City could play as many as seven games at the Club World Cup in a breathless summer

'Normally these players are off and they're starting to think about vacation time etc. Honestly, every player I spoke to was telling me, we're coming back.

'We're ready to come back in three weeks' time. I was speaking to Rodri as an example, he's looking for games. Erling didn't want to go on vacation.

'He wanted to stay with the physios and prepare for next season. That's the attitude you want and that's exactly why you see me so positive.

'We're going to come back strong, with a lot of positivity.'

NWSL

In April, Trinity Rodman struck early for the U.S. Women's National Team against Brazil, with her first goal for the team since the 2024 Olympics. She received the ball from forward Alyssa Thompson and finished with a shot into the lower right corner of the net. It was her 11th goal for the national team.

While the crowd's cheers filled SoFi Stadium, they did not see what happened in the locker room at halftime.

Rodman's sweat-soaked, mud-streaked jersey was carefully collected by the team's equipment manager and placed in a sealed container bound for a warehouse in Amsterdam with eight other jerseys. These belonged to her teammates: Lindsey Heaps, Catarina Macario, Tara McKeown, Emily Fox, Allyson Sentnor, Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Crystal Dunn and Sam Coffey.

Almost three months later, on Saturday, the jersey was sold for $1,833 on MatchWornShirt.com, an online marketplace that auctions signed match-worn shirts from around the world. The Dutch company collaborates with over 300 soccer clubs and federations across 35 countries, and it has just signed a deal with both U.S. national teams.

During the USWNT's friendly against China in Minnesota on Saturday, the platform will launch its first live auction tied to a match. Every jersey worn will be up for grabs. The deal with U.S. Soccer and the USWNT Players Association also covers player-worn kits from all international tournaments moving forward, including the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, and the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil.



The idea of selling worn jerseys came to brothers and co-founders Bob and Tijmen Zonderwijk in 2016 while they were searching for a special gift for their father, a die-hard Ajax supporter, who was moving across the country for work. They wanted to get him a match-worn, signed jersey from one of his favorite players to hang in his new office. At the time, the only option was the annual club auction.

After a year trying to convince Dutch clubs of their new idea, one finally gave in: FC Twente, where Dutch captain Jill Roord recently signed.

“We pitched the idea there, and the guy was quiet for the entire hour. After that, he said, ‘Hey, it sounds like a win-win. When can we start?' So we were like, ‘s***, this is happening!'” Bob Zonderwijk told The Athletic.

In addition to a handful of USWNT and USMNT jerseys, the company's warehouse in Amsterdam is home to about 9,000 match-worn jerseys.

Historically, the locker room and those sweat-soaked jerseys are sacred for players. Most keep them. Some toss them to fans. Others trade them with opponents. Either way, they're prized. The Zonderwijk brothers, lifelong soccer fans, knew better than to mess with that.

“We don't want to interfere with those traditions,” Tijmen Zonderwijk said.

So they found a workaround: they collect only first-half jerseys. “Players are free to do whatever they want with the second-half kits — keep them, swap them, toss them into the stands,” he explains. Which means the Rodman jersey that just sold is certified and guaranteed to be the very shirt she scored in.

Operationally, every club is structured differently but MatchWornShirt's co-founders realized that to streamline their operations, they had to work with the most important person in the room: the kit managers. Last year, they hosted the first European conference of kit managers in Amsterdam, inviting 180 club representatives and 90 kit managers from partner clubs.

“The good thing about kitmen is that they are structured and reliable. They have their own protocols and once we become part of that protocol, we are all good,” Tijmen explained.

This is especially crucial when it comes to getting the jerseys cleaned. Or rather, not cleaned.

Instead of soap and water, the jerseys are treated with UVC light, a method that breaks down any lingering DNA to protect the player's health data but preserves the emotion: the grass stains, the wear and tear, even a trace of the smell.

“Eighty percent of the smell is reduced, but the smell is always there. It's also what makes it authentic,” Tijmen said. “If it smelled like flowers, then people might also question the authenticity.”

Once the jerseys are cleaned, the process of authentication starts: using match footage, they check how patches are printed to match them to the player wearing them. Then they chip the shirts with NFC (Near Field Communication) chips that carry a unique ID to certify their authenticity. NFC, commonly used for non-contact payments, uses close-range wireless technology to communicate between devises.

So far, the highest price paid for a women's match-worn shirt belongs to Sophia Smith's (now Wilson) No. 9 jersey that she wore while scoring in Portland Thorns' 2-0 NWSLchampionship win over Kansas City Current in 2022. It sold for $9,507 (£7,062). On the men's side, the most expensive jersey auctioned on the site was worn by Lionel Messi from his final season playing for Paris Saint-Germain. The winning bid was $58,000.

MatchWornShirt did not share how the money gets split between them and the clubs, as the company doesn't disclose specific contract terms. But each partnership is tailored to reflect the commercial and charitable priorities of the teams and organizations involved. In the case of the U.S. Soccer, the deal includes both the federation and the respective players' associations. That means the proceeds are shared, and players get a cut.

According to USWNT Players Association's agreement with the players, the PA receives payment from licenses like MatchWornShirt and players receive royalties. According to their financial statements from 2023, the organization paid its members $1,059,963 in royalties which amounts to 34.7 percent of the total revenue. The U.S. Women's National Team Players Association's (USWNTPA) Department of Labor report from 2024 shows that in 2023 former U.S. forward Alex Morgan took home the most in overall royalties ($167,593). Wilson ($74,232) and Rodman ($41,643) weren't far behind.

“With so many newcomers earning their first caps for the USWNT, these jerseys carry deep significance,” Annie Mitchell-Reid, the director of strategic partnerships and business at USWNTPA, told The Athletic. “Think of sisters Alyssa and Gisele Thompson making their debuts side by side, and others who will wear the stars and stripes for the first time or even the last time. There are so many amazing moments to come that fans can have a tangible piece of.”

But what happens if a jersey doesn't sell at one of MatchWorn's auctions? The Zonderwijks are not worried.

“We've never not sold a jersey,” Tijmen said with a grin.

The United States Women's National Team hit the field for their first match of the May/June international window this afternoon when they take on China at Allianz Field in St. Paul, Minnesota. The USWNT once again have a roster that has some newer faces as head coach Emma Hayes continues to evaluate players and identify a core group that she can rely on when Women's World Cup qualifying begins next year.

China, ranked 17th in the world, is always a tough out, and the two teams have a history that dates back to 1986. China is the second most common opponent for the USWNT, with this being the 61st time the two teams have faced each other (only Canada, at 66 matches, have faced the USWNT more). They present the kind of test some of the newer players need as they try to show they belong on the international level and with the national team.

It should be a nice afternoon in St. Paul as the USWNT renew their rivalry with China.

Lo'eau LaBonta may be in her first camp with the USWNT at 32 years old, but age is just a number.

Head coach Emma Hayes echoed that sentiment after calling LaBonta up for the two friendlies versus China PR (May 31 at 5:30 p.m. ET) and Jamaica (June 3 at 8 p.m. ET).

“She's trained really well this week, and she's fit really well into the group,” Hayes said. “She's got a great personality. Brings a lot of great energy to the locker room.”

Hayes has harped on developing the young pool of talent in the lead-up to larger tournaments like the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2027, but that doesn't mean sacrificing leadership. Hayes sees LaBonta as a great role model for players like 17-year-old Yohannes.

Midfielder Yohannes may be a teenager, but she's already got a year of USWNT experience on LaBonta. In June 2024, Yohannes earned her first cap — and her first goal — at Allianz Field in St. Paul, Minn. where LaBonta dons the red, white and blue for the first time. So, as Yohannes is learning tactically from a seasoned player like LaBonta, she's also sharing her breakfast combo and other valuable knowledge all first-timers need to know just as others taught her.

“[Veterans] have been here for so long, so they know how it is coming in as a first timer, and now that I've been in camp for a little while, I think I've grown my comfortability,” Yohannes said. “I'm just trying to continue to grow.”

Meanwhile, for LaBonta, it's a balance trying to learn as a newbie and being a leader for players like Yohannes and her Kansas City Current teammate Michelle Cooper.

“It's interesting because they have all the answers, right?” LaBonta said. “I think it's interesting to have to lean on [younger teammates]. ... It doesn't matter how old you are, how young you are, you can still ask people, you still learn.”

International soccer is a different style of play from what LaBonta is used to as captain at Current, the No. 1 NWSL squad. It's faster, and LaBonta is reveling in it, excited to take it back to her club.

“I would have loved to develop in this environment, but I'm here now and I'm enjoying it,” LaBonta said.

Yohannes, however, is developing in the international system. LaBonta eager to play with a rising talent, and calls herself a fan.

Still, Hayes preaches the long game when it comes to Yohannes, allowing the young player to develop into the international star that many see the potential of her becoming. That's where LaBonta and other leaders come in.

“[Yohannes] has got unbelievable maturity and coachability, and someone who I know is going to become an important part of our program,” Hayes said, “but I'm invested in that development, and we have to be patient with that.”

This summer will see the first edition of the new-look Club World Cup tournament, as the likes of Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid prepare to compete for the prestigious trophy.

This new competition is really an expanded version of the Club World Cup we've seen before, but which previously featured fewer teams.

Chelsea and Man City have actually won the trophy before, as have Manchester United and Liverpool, but Premier League clubs previously had to qualify by winning the Champions League, and even then would only take part in a semi-final and final.

So, how does the new-look Club World Cup look and when is it on this summer? We've got all the info for you below…

Not long after the traditional end of the club season, fans can look forward to even more football as the Club World Cup kicks off on the 15th of June.

The tournament will then run for almost a month, with the final set to take place on the 13th of July.

The biggest names from England Europe to watch out for are Chelsea, Manchester City, Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain, Inter Milan and Juventus.

From elsewhere, we could see some big-name players in action for Saudi and MLS clubs.

Lionel Messi's Inter Miami will undoubtedly be one star attraction, while Al Hilal also boast big names like Ruben Neves, Kalidou Koulibaly and Joao Cancelo on their books.

And of course, there are so often some underrated gems to watch out for from South America, so keep an eye on Brazilian sides Palmeiras and Fluminense, as well as Argentinian giants Boca Juniors and River Plate.

There's a huge amount up for grabs for the winners of the 2025 Club World cup – £97m ($125m).

It may be a new tournament, at least in this format, but it's no wonder clubs have been so keen to take part in it even after such long and gruelling seasons.

For comparison, you can win £176m for winning the Premier League, £135m for winning the Champions League, and just £3.9m for the FA Cup.

In another unusual twist for this summer, there will be a mini transfer window running from June 1st until June 10th before a longer one later on.

This allows clubs competing in the Club World Cup to bring in new players early so they can compete in the tournament.

Player contracts tend to run from July 1st until June 30th, so it also means we're seeing things like Trent Alexander-Arnold moving to Real Madrid for a €10m fee, rather than waiting to join as a free agent later.

If Real had waited to sign Alexander-Arnold at the end of his contract, he'd have been free, but wouldn't have been able to play for them in the Club World Cup, so Madrid will feel it was worth paying a small amount to get him in earlier.

When you look at the prize money on offer, with Los Blancos sure to be one of the tournament favourites, it's hard to argue against that probably being a smart decision.

There's no doubt that the introduction of this new tournament has attracted criticism.

On the face of it, it's pretty clear that this is yet another money-spinner by FIFA, and it seems far from ideal for player welfare.

We're already seeing so many injuries due to high work load, with the footballing calendar busier than ever, and with the modern game so fast and intense.

Fans will be glad of more football to watch over the summer, but it will be interesting to see what kind of quality of football we see from what may likely be a lot of tired players.

The U.S. women's national team is back in action as they prepare to face China and Jamaica in a pair of friendlies. The stars and stripes will kick off their summer calendar when they face China on Saturday at Allianz Field in Saint Paul, Minnesota. China and the USWNT will meet for the 61st time, and the USA holds the all-time series (38-9-13). The previous 60 meetings make China the second-most faced nation in USWNT history behind Canada. 

Head coach Emma Hayes has named a 24-player roster for the upcoming matches, with a balance of newcomers and veterans, as the staff continues to evaluate the player pool in the build-up to the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup.

Defender Naomi Girma returns to the squad for the first time in 2025, and forward Lynn Biyendolo returns following her appearance in the SheBelieves Cup in February. Lo'eau LaBonta, a 32-year-old NWSL midfielder and Attacking Third contributor, is participating in her first senior national team camp.

Angel City FC fullback Gisele Thompson departed national team camp due to a minor hip injury, U.S. Soccer announced on Thursday. The defender typically plays outside back for her club, and was previously in national team camps as a defender, but Hayes named Thompson as part of the forward core with aspirations to evaluate the player as a winger alongside her older sister Alyssa Thompson. 

Here are storylines, how you can watch the match and more:

The two countries have a long history with meetings in major tournaments, most notably the 1996 Olympic gold medal match and the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, where the USWNT were victorious. The two sides recently played in December 2023 during two matches to close out the calendar year. The USWNT won both meetings, defeating China 3-0 and 2-1. Goals were scored by Sophia Wilson, Lindsey Heaps, Trinity Rodman, Sam Coffey, and Jaedyn Shaw. 

Orlando Pride, and former Penn State alum, Kerry Abello is in her first national team camp following a standout year where she helped Orlando win the 2024 NWSL Shield and NWSL Championship and earned NWSL Second Best XI honors. She joins a list of 23 players who earned first time call-ups to the national team under Emma Hayes. 

"Honestly, my mentality is just to give it my best and try to soak in as much of it as I can, and kind of lead with curiosity and gratitude, just for being here. Rather than, you know, nervousness or fear or anything," Abello told Attacking Third on her approach to camps. 

"I've wanted this for so long, and I'm just excited to get this opportunity, and at the end of the day, I don't have any control over the decisions they make for the rosters for each camp, for the rosters for tournaments. So, I think it's a big relief in a way for me to just get the opportunity to give it my best shot, and then the decisions that are made after that are, are out of my hands. So, yeah, I'm kind of just coming into it blind in the best way. I'm just gonna give it my all every second and enjoy it."

USWNT: Phallon Tulis-Joyce; Emily Fox, Tara McKeown, Emily Sonnett, Crystal Dunn; Sam Coffey, Lily Yohannes, Lindsey Heaps; Ally Sentnor, Catarina Macario, Alyssa Thompson

China: Xu Huan; Dou Jiaxing, Wu Haiyan, Linlin Wang,  Li Mengwen; Wang Yanwen, Liu Jing, Yao Wei, Zhang Xin; Jin Kun, Shao Ziqin 

Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign): During a roster announcement press conference, Hayes referenced Dickey's NWSL stats, "the data don't lie," and the coach is correct. Among American goalkeepers active in NWSL through 10 games, Dickey leads in save percentage (74.3%), crosses claimed (11), and fewest goals against (nine). She's been part of national team camps, but has yet to make a debut, and that could change during this window.

The USWNT is coming off a split series against Brazil, a 2-0 win and a 2-1 loss, which Hayes has alluded to as another learning opportunity for the group. The next match provides that new chance for the USWNT against a national team program also building toward the next World Cup. 

China is coming off a pair of lopsided victories against Uzbekistan (5-0) and Thailand (5-1) in April. The wins followed a third place finish at the Pinatar Cup in February with very mixed results (1-1-1) against Canada, Chinese Taipei, and Mexico. Manager Ante Milicic is celebrating one year with the program and evaluating his "modern playing style" approach with the squad. 

It's two very different teams going head to head for the first time since 2023. New players and new coaches could either mean fireworks, or some periods of figuring things out before the goals breakthrough. Pick: USWNT 2, China 1

LAFC will host Club América at BMO Stadium for a Play-In game to decide the final participant in the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup.

The winner of the match will not only replace Club León in Group D of the new-look tournament, but will also bag $9.55 million in prize money just for qualifying, making this one of the biggest games ever in the MLS vs. Liga MX rivalry.

LAFC were selected to participate in the Play-In game because they were the team that lost to León in the 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup final, the result that provisionally secured León's birth in the Club World Cup.

Club América, on the other hand, were picked because they were the top seeded team in FIFA's Concacaf club rankings, thanks to deep runs in the Concacaf Champions Cup recently and three straight Liga MX titles.

Although the game is taking place at LAFC's home stadium, a large contingent of Club América fans are expected to paint the stands yellow in what promises to be an absolute spectacle. Here's all you need to know ahead of LAFC vs. Club América battle for the final ticket to the Club World Cup.

There's an argument to be made that this is LAFC's biggest game since in their debut season in 2018. 

Steve Cherundolo's side arrive to the match riding an eight-game unbeaten streak in MLS, having scored 19 goals during that run. But the surge in attacking firepower has been matched by LAFC's leaky defense that's conceded 12 goals in that same span, resulting in the team winning just three games in that stretch, drawing the other five.

LAFC's back line can't afford to perform at the level they've displayed recently considering Club América's attack very well might be the best they've faced all year.

Denis Bouanga's 10 goals in all competitions this season lead the way for LAFC and he'll carry the bulk of the attacking burden. However, Olivier Giroud's big-game experience could prove to be a difference maker, with the Frenchman looking for a performance worthy of a franchise player.

Timothy Tillman is the only major injury blow Cherundolo has to deal with, other than him, he's got the rest of his roster at his disposal to defeat the Liga MX giants.

LAFC Predicted Lineup vs. Club America (4-3-3): Lloris; Palencia, Long, Segura, Hollingshead; Amaya, Jesus, Delgado; Ordaz, Ebobisse, Bouanga

Las Águilas are still licking their wounds after losing the Liga MX Clausura 2025 final last weekend, ending their quest to become the second team in Mexican top-flight history to win four titles in a row.

Even after such a devastating defeat, Las Águilas are a formidable foe, perhaps even more dangerous now as they look for revenge following last Sunday's heartbreak. 

América were held scoreless in back-to-back games for only the third time in the last four years and they haven't fired blanks in three straight games since the start of the decade. An eerie omen for LAFC.

However, the health status of captain and talisman Henry Martín has stolen the headlines all week. The legendary striker was forced to exit Sunday's final with a muscular injury and although reports indicate Jardine will play him, his minutes will likely be limited.

A positive for Las Águilas is the return of former LAFC winger Brian Rodríguez. The Uruguay international returned after over a month in the sidelines and will certainly play a key role in América's attack at his former home.

Club America Predicted Lineup vs. LAFC (5-3-2): Malagón; Álvarez, Reyes, Cáceres, Juárez, Borja; Dos Santos, Sánchez, Fidalgo; Zendejas, Aguirre

It's a cracking matchup on paper between two of the best teams in the region in one of the highest-stakes games of the MLS vs. Liga MX rivalry to date.

Both teams will likely open the game cautiously, analyzing their opponent and trying assert their control of the contest. As the minutes tick on, scoring chances will begin presenting themselves for both teams.

However, after trading punches, it could be Club América who emerges victorious. Jardine's extensive track-record of brilliant knockout-stage game plans may very well prove to be key. América are poised to frustrate LAFC with their stout and experienced defensive line and the Alvaro Zendejas–Alvaro Fidalgo duo will be difficult to contain for 90 minutes, especially if Martín is fit enough to enter the game in the second half.

In the end, the winningest club in Liga MX and Concacaf Champions Cup history are favorites to secure the final ticket to the FIFA Club World Cup 2025, winning the most expensive match in North American Soccer history.

Cristiano Ronaldo's future at Al Nassr is up in the air after a disappointing season, and his contract is set to expire at the end of next month.

The 40-year-old also posted a cryptic message on his social media earlier this week, writing: “This chapter is over. The story? Still being written.”

With Al Nassr not involved in the tournament, there have long been suggestions that Ronaldo could compete at FIFA's inaugural expanded Club World Cup, which takes place in the United States this summer. And the body's president Gianni Infantino added fuel to the fire during an interview with YouTuber IShowSpeed last weekend.

Discussing Lionel Messi competing in the event with his MLS club Inter Miami, Infantino then added: “And Ronaldo might play for one of the teams as well at the Club World Cup. There are discussions with some clubs, so if any club is watching and is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup… who knows, who knows.”

A special transfer window opens for teams competing in the Club World Cup between June 1 and June 10, with sides able to add players before its opening game on June 14.

So, could a team move to sign Ronaldo between now and then? Are any of them interested? Is there a chance he could face eternal rival Messi, surely for the final time in their careers, at this tournament?

The Athletic's team of reporters approached figures at clubs competing at the Club World Cup to ask whether they would be interested in a move for Ronaldo. Unless otherwise noted, those people spoke under the condition of anonymity to protect relationships.

Their responses are below.

Chelsea turned down the opportunity to sign Ronaldo in 2022, and are not going to change their minds three years later.

The London club have already compiled a list of players they want to play up front for them in the future, including Hugo Ekitike, Liam Delap — who Chelsea have reached a transfer agreement for — and Benjamin Sesko. Like most of the Chelsea squad, these are players all under the age of 25 and have the best of their careers still to come. Their wage demands also fit into the general structure in place at Stamford Bridge.

Ronaldo, while respected for all his achievements, simply does not fit into the club's recruitment strategy.

Simon Johnson

No chance.

Juventus are still in arbitration with Ronaldo over an agreement that was made to defer some of his wages while he was with the Turin club during the Covid-19 pandemic. Last year, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) ordered Juventus to pay more than €9.7million ($10.35m, £8.3m), plus interest, to Ronaldo in back wages.

James Horncastle

As exciting as it could be, a Messi vs Ronaldo clash in the opening match of the 2025 Club World Cup is unlikely to happen.

Ronaldo joining Al Ahly, the Egyptian side who kick the tournament off against Messi's Inter Miami in that Florida city in two weeks' time, is a transfer that's only possible in video games. Financially, the move just isn't logical due to his salary requirements.

Ahmed Walid

Mamelodi Sundowns are South Africa's richest team, backed by one of the country's wealthiest men, Patrice Motsepe, who has been in charge since 2003. Since Motsepe became president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) in 2021, his son, Thlopie, has taken over as club chairman, running Sundowns on a day-to-day basis.

Advertisement

Thlopie confirmed last week that they are considering using the forthcoming transfer window but any new faces are only likely to arrive once their involvement in the Club World Cup is over. That responsibility will fall on Flemming Berg, the club's Danish sporting director, and his assistant, Ryan Hunt.

Simon Hughes

Palmeiras have not made any move, nor do they plan to do so, to sign Ronaldo. That has been the club's position since mid-May, when the first rumours surfaced that a team from Brazil was interested in the Portuguese forward. They also added they did not envision any Brazilian club being able to afford such a move.

The doubts about whether Ronaldo will stay in Saudi Arabia or not, with his current contract about to expire, have not changed the scenario at the Sao Paulo club.

Their attacking options will be young Estevao, a right-winger who will join Chelsea after this tournament; the Argentine Jose Manuel Lopez; or Vitor Roque, who failed to meet expectations at Spanish sides Barcelona and Real Betis over the past two seasons and did not score in his first nine games with Palmeiras after joining in February.

Mario Cortegana

Even as their  Brazilian rivals have made a habit of making splashy signings from European football over the past decade, Fluminense have generally been more circumspect. This is in large part due to their financial situation: compared to the country's big hitters — Palmeiras, Flamengo, Corinthians — they have a pretty modest budget and prefer to cut their cloth accordingly.

It was no surprise, then, that a source at the club immediately rejected the idea that Rio de Janeiro-based Fluminense could offer Ronaldo a new challenge.

Jack Lang

Another Brazilian side who have no interest in, and have had no discussions over, signing Ronaldo.

Although the club's owner, John Textor, attended Al Nassr training sessions due to his relationship with their chief executive Majed AlJamaan, any suggestion that he might join the Rio side or that he would be involved in the Eagle Football multi-club vehicle where Textor is chairman have been described to The Athletic as “a bizarre fantasy story”.

Matt Woosnam

Flamengo have also ruled out a move for Ronaldo ahead of the Club World Cup, mainly for financial reasons. Jorginho's arrival from Arsenal is their latest planned move for the tournament.

Jose Boto, Flamengo's sporting director, is Portuguese and has very good contacts in his home country, which could potentially facilitate the deal at some point. However, it is not something Rio-based Flamengo have seriously considered.

Mario Cortegana

Inter's American ownership, the asset management firm Oaktree, has provided stability and financial security for this weekend's Champions League finalists. They are also committed to rejuvenating a squad that is the oldest in this season's Champions League.

“Investments will be made in slightly younger profiles who represent a real asset, players with potential who are an asset for the present and the future,” Inter's CEO Giuseppe Marotta explained to The Athletic this week. That doesn't sound like Ronaldo, who turned 40 in February.

Advertisement

Marotta was at Juventus when Ronaldo joined them in 2018, but that was a signing driven by colleague Fabio Paratici. Marotta left the club a few months later, and Inter have since replaced Juventus as the real force in Italian football.

The prospect of Marotta signing Ronaldo for Inter — regardless of the new ownership's strategy for the Milanese club — is unlikely.

James Horncastle

Ronaldo and City manager Pep Guardiola nearly joined forces in 2021 before he decided to return to neighbours United from Juventus at the eleventh hour. A deal was broadly agreed then, but long phone conversations with former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and ex-Old Trafford team-mate Rio Ferdinand convinced Ronaldo how ruinous switching to the other side of Manchester would be for his legacy.

At the time, City were also looking at Harry Kane to fill the centre-forward void left by the departure during the same window of Sergio Aguero. There is no such vacancy now that they have Erling Haaland, who has committed himself to the club for the next decade. City also added Omar Marmoush to their attacking ranks in January and are attempting to bring down the average age of the squad.

Ronaldo is into his fifth decade, his powers are understandably waning, and he is unlikely to be able to play on one of the wings anymore. That said, the way Guardiola has incorporated Haaland into his team by allowing him not to get involved in any build-up play is a dilution of his football idealism that was not known four years ago.

It would have been fun to see Guardiola work with Ronaldo, having played such an important role in Messi's first few years at Barcelona, but the chances of it happening are virtually zero.

Jordan Campbell

Since his departure from Madrid to join Juventus, Ronaldo has explored the possibility of moving back to the Bernabeu on several occasions. The last opportunity was two years ago, when he was on his way out of United.

According to senior sources at Madrid, his agent at the time, Jorge Mendes, offered him to them several times during the summer of 2023, with very advantageous financial conditions.

Advertisement

The club's stance has always been clear in these situations, as it was during this season when the possibility of Sergio Ramos returning also came up: they have total gratitude for both players' time at the club, but they believe it should be left in the past.

Madrid are committed to their project, which is now focused on new blood, without focusing on the economic elements.

Mario Cortegana and Guillermo Rai

There is zero chance. Bayern's forward line will be led by Kane this summer in the States, and Ronaldo would offer nothing beyond unhelpful media attention.

The German champions are paying no attention to his availability at all.

Sebastian Stafford-Bloor

The French club have not made any moves in terms of Ronaldo, and has no plans to do so. Their total focus is on the Champions League final showdown with Inter on Saturday night, which also shows why bringing him in is not among their plans.

Their overall project as a club has pivoted since manager Luis Enrique's 2024 arrival to build a team based on their Spanish coach and young talent, moving away from the collection of the world's most famous stars previously in the line-up.

The success of this season reinforces this idea and has led to renewing the contracts in recent months of the aforementioned Luis Enrique and sporting director Luis Campos, who is always in close contact with club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi.

Mario Cortegana

In Serhou Guirassy, Dortmund believe they have one of the in-form forwards in European football and they will head to the U.S. fully confident in their ability to score plenty of goals in this tournament.

There's no conversation to be had about signing Ronaldo.

Sebastian Stafford-Bloor

Ronaldo will not be joining Atletico for the Club World Cup.

The Spanish club are taking the tournament very seriously, and coach Diego Simeone's team will be playing their usual high-intensity, hard-working style, and have top internationals such as Julian Alvarez, Alexander Sorloth and Antoine Griezmann to lead their attack.

Advertisement

Adding the 40-year-old former Madrid player for their U.S. challenge would just not make sense.

Porto have no interest in signing Ronaldo, who came through the academy at one of their great domestic rivals, Lisbon's Sporting CP.

They are, however, focusing their efforts on another (far younger) forward from the Saudi Pro League: Gabri Veiga. The 23-year-old made a surprise move from Celta Vigo to Al Ahli two years ago and is a key target for them this summer.

James Horncastle

Ronaldo supported Benfica as a young boy, but it would be a colossal surprise if they were to approach him now.

He came through the youth ranks at their local Lisbon rivals, Sporting, and it would need a huge amount of PR massaging to make a cross-city move look like anything other than a betrayal, even at this late stage of his career. He also once stuck a middle finger up at Benfica fans while playing for United, so the appetite from their supporters for his signing might also be limited.

Jack Lang

In recent seasons, the Mexicans have been known for signing La Liga stars such as Sergio Canales and especially Sergio Ramos.

For that reason, it might seem logical that they would be looking to do the same with Ronaldo. However, very senior sources at Monterrey played down this option ahead of the Club World Cup: “We haven't moved on anything at all. But there is so much noise that, if he wants to come and he comes for free, then we will think about it.”

Guillermo Rai

A source close to Ronaldo told The Athletic last week that it would not make sense for Al Nassr to renew his contract and then move him out on loan to a team playing in the Club World Cup.

That said, a renewal is not out of the question. However, a source at the Riyadh club suggested it depended in part on the outcome of their season — and this came to a negative end, with Al Nassr finishing third in the Saudi Pro League, having lost in the Asian Champions League's semi-finals.

Few professionals have the experience Olivier Giroud and Hugo Lloris do on soccer's biggest stages.

When the close friends and 2018 FIFA World Cup champions joined forces in Major League Soccer last year, Giroud and Lloris did so hoping to win together one more time. But neither 38-year-old French legend contemplated that that effort would include something they'd not done before.

With the last spot in the 32-team 2025 FIFA Club World Cup riding on the outcome, that “amazing opportunity,” declared Lloris, is contingent on the Los Angeles Football Club winning a high-stakes showdown Saturday night at sold-out BMO Stadium against Mexican giant Club América.

A guaranteed $9.55 million payday goes to the winning club, as does entry into the tournament's Group D alongside Brazilian standout Flamengo, Espérance Sportive de Tunis and English power Chelsea FC.

Whoever wins Saturday will begin group play against Chelsea on June 16 in Atlanta.

“It could be nice to meet Chelsea again,” shared Giroud, who was part of the Stamford Bridge squad that won its way into the tournament by claiming the 2020-21 UEFA Champions League title. “Obviously, it will be a massive game at the weekend against América.”

While France's all-time leading scorer was notching goals in West London for The Blues and internationally with Les Bleus, Lloris stopped them in the northern part of the city for Tottenham and, as his country's longest-tenured captain, across four trips to the FIFA World Cup.

“After so many years in this business I know when you have an opportunity you have to grab it, take it,” said Lloris, who finished runner-up in the 2019 Champions League final, one of 70 appearances in the tournament since 2008. “There's nothing for granted in football. Just live the moment. Enjoy the moment. But at the same time you don't want to have any regrets.”

Poise and results in pressure-packed games rank high among the reasons LAFC brought in the veteran winners. The season prior to their arrival, regret in similar situations became the Black & Gold story.

LAFC could have secured a spot in the Club World Cup via the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League, but that team ultimately fell flat, losing the two-leg final to Liga MX's Club León.

“This in a sense is a way to redeem that and get us that berth in the Club World Cup,” said defender Ryan Hollingshead, who struggled off the bench that day and acknowledged lingering regret.

The first of three unsuccessful finals for LAFC during head coach Steve Cherundolo's second season seemed to dash the Black & Gold's hope of qualifying for the new-look, high-profile tournament in the U.S. from June 14 to July 13 that boasts a record prize pool of $1 billion.

As fate would have it, six of the 22 LAFC players listed on the team sheet for the second leg against León will get a rare second bite at the apple. On May 6, the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport finalized a ruling that affirmed FIFA's decision to deem León ineligible for the Club World Cup because of ownership ties to the group that runs Pachuca, which also qualified by winning last year's CONCACAF title.

FIFA's contingency plan put LAFC, an 8-year-old MLS team, in the dare-to-dream scenario opposite 108-year-old América, which, despite losing the Liga MX Clausura final to Toluca on Tuesday, has reigned over Mexican soccer in recent years.

The teams' only official encounter came in 2020. A dramatic 3-1 win for LAFC spearheaded by Mexican great Carlos Vela, who scored twice in two minutes, sent the Black & Gold into the CONCACAF Champions League final for the first time in its history.

(If América needed a reminder about the pandemic-era loss at a neutral site in Orlando, this week LAFC announced Vela's official retirement and named the 35-year-old attacker the first Black & Gold Ambassador.)

Although Saturday's contest takes place on the LAFC grounds, the match, run by FIFA, should take on a neutral feel, mimicking the 50/50 atmosphere from the clubs' preseason meeting at BMO Stadium in February.

“Listen, last time we played them in our stadium, I know it was only a friendly game, but there was more yellow in the stands than black jerseys,” noted Lloris, who became familiar with América while playing in Europe.

Home fans, the 3252, will occupy the standing section in the North End. A strong contingent of América supporters is expected to overtake the opposite side of the stadium for a game that requires two 15-minute periods of extra time and the potential for a penalty shootout if the score is tied at the end of regulation.

LAFC enters the match unbeaten in its last eight – three wins and five draws in MLS regular-season action – since falling to Inter Miami in the CONCACAF Champions Cup quarterfinals on April 9, an outcome that felt as self-inflicted as the faulty finals in 2023.

To get things right against América, Giroud and Lloris prescribed a sense of calm and serenity on the pitch, all the while matching or surpassing the opponent's confidence, energy and intensity.

“That's the only way to face bigger clubs,” Lloris said. “It's easy to talk. But the most important truth is what is going to happen on the field.”

When: Saturday, 7:30 p.m.

Where: BMO Stadium

Twelve months ago at Roland Garros, Alexander Bublik was a Top 20 player. Holding a ranking he never imagined possible, Bublik felt compelled to become more of a “professional solider” and less of a free spirit.He trained harder, he adopted a stricter diet, he shied away from parties. Yet by March of this year, the Kazakh found himself outside of the Top 80. His stretch of tough blows and early exits wasn't the result of poor effort, but rather, reaching empty on the gas tank.“Right now everybody is like robots, and they're just crazy, crazy performance guys. Then I did it. Unfortunately, to be honest, my fall was not linked with lack of attitude and lack of practicing. It was the exact opposite. I just burned out because I was waiting for the results to come,” Bublik reflected Saturday to reporters in Paris.

At Indian Wells, the 27-year-old bowed out in the first round to Yosuke Watanuki on a Wednesday afternoon. With time to spare, his coach Artem Suprunov suggested taking a road trip to Las Vegas ahead of the Phoenix Challenger. With his pupil posting two wins and eight losses to start his season, Suprunov kept it real, as Bublik tells it.“He's like, ‘Man, if you play like this, we're just going to be out of tennis', of the conversation by Wimbledon because that's where my points are. After Wimbledon I made, like, 50 points,” he recalled.Bublik agreed to the change of pace, spending three days in the Sin City and turning up for his opener in Phoenix a few hours beforehand with the mindset he was “useless” and simply needed to “let it be.”The approach did the trick.“I said, ‘Okay, let's go to Vegas.' We enjoy. We change the racquet. We did many things. I said, Okay, if it goes, it goes. If not, thank you very much, tennis, and it worked,” he said.

Bublik went on to finish runner-up to Joao Fonseca in turning a corner. By his third event of the clay-court season, he strung together three wins—including a Top 10 victory over reigning title holder Andrey Rublev–en route to the round of 16 at the Mutua Madrid Open. Prior to arriving in the French capital for the second major of the year, Bublik stood in the winners' circle at the Turin Challenger.The momentum swing has carried into Roland Garros, where Bublik finds himself in the second week for the first time thanks to a run that includes a two-set comeback against ninth seed Alex de Minaur in-between a pair of straight-set wins.“I just took matches way more seriously, because I can't see myself out (of the) Top 100 and not being able to play the tournaments I like to play, because I still have courage to play tennis,” he said.“That's why. I guess there was just a shift in the mentality because I had no options whatsoever.”

Like his next opponent, the left-hander is more known for producing the goods on quicker surfaces but has translated his game tremendously to the terre battue. With today's decisive dismissal of Fonseca, Draper has won 12 clay-court matches this spring – having held nine in his career prior to 2025.“Jack for me is insane. I saw him first day here. I'm like, ‘Are you getting ready for UFC?' Last year the guy is 40 in the world. This year he is Top 4, Top 5 in the world. That's a crazy achievement,” said Bublik.“He doesn't seem to stop, so I mean, what do I have to do to beat him? I don't know. I will just go there, enjoy the time, show what I'm capable of showing, and we all know what I'm capable of doing on court and then we see how it goes.”

I guess there was just a shift in the mentality because I had no options whatsoever.”

Like his next opponent, the left-hander is more known for producing the goods on quicker surfaces but has translated his game tremendously to the terre battue. With today's decisive dismissal of Fonseca, Draper has won 12 clay-court matches this spring – having held nine in his career prior to 2025.“Jack for me is insane. I saw him first day here. I'm like, ‘Are you getting ready for UFC?' Last year the guy is 40 in the world. This year he is Top 4, Top 5 in the world. That's a crazy achievement,” said Bublik.“He doesn't seem to stop, so I mean, what do I have to do to beat him? I don't know. I will just go there, enjoy the time, show what I'm capable of showing, and we all know what I'm capable of doing on court and then we see how it goes.”

Jack Draper beats teenage Brazilian star Joao Fonseca in straight sets in the third round of the French Open at Roland-Garros; you can watch the ATP and WTA tours on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Saturday 31 May 2025 16:54, UK

​​​​​​Jack Draper swept aside 18-year-old Joao Fonseca to reach the last 16 at the French Open and remain on course for a quarter-final against world No 1 Jannik Sinner.

British No 1 Draper, the fifth seed in Paris, beat Fonseca 6-2 6-4 6-2 to secure a fourth-round clash with Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik, who breezed past Portuguese qualifier Henrique Rocha 7-5 6-1 6-2.

Sinner trounced Jiri Lehecka 6-0 6-1 6-2 earlier on Saturday - the Italian is yet to drop a set in the tournament - and will next face Russian 17th seed Andrey Rublev at Roland-Garros.

If he comes through that and Draper beats Bublik, the two will meet in the last eight - nine months after Sinner defeated the Brit in the semi-finals of the US Open in New York.

Draper took command of the first set, dictating the action in their rallies and moving well across the clay court. He pounced on Fonseca's efforts to wrong foot him with drop shots, seizing those opportunities to punish the Brazilian.

He remained assured in the second set, taking advantage of Fonseca's mistakes to exert further pressure on the Brazilian teenager.

He picked the break he needed, first slicing over a pinpoint drop shot that dotted down at a tight angle then seeing Fonseca hit the net within a rally.

He staved off Fonseca's attempt to fight back as he closed out the second set and made sure to take control of the third set from the very start.

With two early breaks, Draper went 4-0 up before the young Brazilian could get a game on the board. Fonseca clawed two games back, but never threatened to overhaul the Briton.

"I played good," Draper said afterwards. "The conditions were quite difficult out here. I felt like the first set was really key and then I kind of got on top of him a little bit and I felt like I used my forehand well.

"I served pretty well and mentally it was a good performance from me. The ball was getting up more and it suits me, the faster conditions. Either way I'll be ready for my next round. Happy to be in second week and hopefully more to come."

This was Draper and Fonseca's second meeting on the ATP Tour, with Draper also winning the first - at Indian Wells in March en route to claiming the biggest title of his career to date.

Draper had never won a match at the French Open prior to this year, losing in the first round in 2023 and 2024, but is now a genuine title contender.

BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) — Jessica Pegula has reached the fourth round of the French Open for the second time in her career.

Pegula, the No. 3 seed in the season's second Grand Slam tennis tournament, won her third match at Roland Garros on Saturday, coming back to defeat 2019 French Open finalist and 2023 Wimbledon champion Markéta Vondroušová from the Czech Republic in three sets (3-6, 6-4, 6-2).

The 31-year-old Buffalonian whose parent own the Bills and Sabres will face Lois Boisson from France on Monday for a spot in the quarterfinals.

This is the furthest Pegula has advanced at the French Open since she was a quarterfinalist in 2022. She reached the third round in 2023 and withdrew from the tournament last year due to a neck injury.

Pegula has won WTA events in Austin and Charleston this season, and reached the third round at the Australian Open. Last season she was a U.S. Open finalist, but lost in the second round of the other major tournaments she played in.

 Jessica Pegula wins Charleston Open, rising to No. 3 in world

Coco Gauff needed just two sets to triumph over Marie Bouzková in the third round of the French Open on Saturday. The American sensation swept the opposition, 6-1, 7-6 to advance to the fourth round at Roland Garros.

Gauff established an early lead in the first set before Bouzková appeared to rally back from the deficit. Gauff eventually sealed the deal in the first to head into the second with the lead.

In the second, Bouzková went up 2-0 as Gauff looked to rally back. After Gauff closed the lead to 2-1, Bouzkova kept inching away, going up 3-1. Just when Gauff looked like she was about to drop her first set in the French Open this year, she climbed up to tie the set 5-5.

The thrilling back and forth concluded in dramatic fashion as the world No. 2 successfully rallied back to take the victory.

We talk in tennis of a transition game, moving from one set of strokes to the next, moving seamlessly up the court from one position to another. Professional tennis is undergoing a more cosmic transition game, pivoting from the Big Three/Serena Williams Era—where four bankable, historically great players each won more than 20 majors—to an era of many stars, if not quite at the same wattage.


This was thrown into relief during Week 1 at Roland Garros of 2025. The first day featured a pitch-perfect retirement ceremony for the great Rafael Nadal, the Big Three and Andy Murray—three of them in retirement—appeared in street clothes to toast the 14-time Roland Garros champ and usher in the post-Rafa Era. Then, play commenced and attention turned to active players. 


Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, No. 1 and No.2, remained committed to their bits. A spirited Brazilian contingent (is there any other kind?) made the matches of 18-year-old Joao Fonseca seem like World Cup qualifiers. Arthur Fils lent hope that there could be a homegrown men's champ for the first since the 80s. Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff and Jasmine Paolini charmed (day) crowds. Americans and Brits and an Aussie (welcome, Daria Kasatkina) remain. There are more big movers than big servers. The field is gloriously open with possibility.

As this event, also, makes the turn … herewith our 2025 French Open midterm grades:

The Turnaround artists: A week before the event Novak Djokovic and Iga Świątek had won a combined zero titles in the last 50 weeks and both, for different reasons, looked to be declining assets. Even at 38, he is doing a fine Djokovic impersonation And, rejuvenated by returning to Roland Garros she is looking like a fine bet to take another title.

The contenders: For all the action and story lines, not much in the way of upsets. Nine of the top-10 seeds remain. (And the lone loss came from a player, Taylor Fritz, who has been injured and struggling for much of the year.)


Teenage created draw wasteland: Twenty is the new … 20. The kids are back. Special commendation to Mirra Andreeva and then 18-year-old revelations Fonseca of Brazil and Victoria Mboko or Canada.


Ethan Quinn: Lone American to qualify for the main draw, former Georgia Bulldog keeps winning.


The Rafa Nadal Tribute: Like all tournaments, this one does some things right, some things not so right. This was a clean winner. The champ got the ceremony he deserved.

The Brits: After going winless in 2024, three make the third round (for the first time in 50 years) and two make Week 2.

The Yanks: The women are cruising as usual. Shoutout Hailey Baptiste. And at this writing, three men are still alive—gritty Tommy Paul, cruising Ben Shelton and resurgent Frances Tiafoe—into Week 2, first time since 1995. 


The USTA: After an encouraging week here—and a week after announcing an $800 million overhaul of Arthur Ashe Stadium—it is in search of a new  leader, as chief executive Lew Sherr leaves abruptly to take an executive position with the New York Mets.

The late-30s crowd: Stirring shotmaking and stirring nostalgia. But only Djokovic (38) remains as Gael Monfils (38), Richard Gasquet (39 this month) and Stan Wawrinka (40) all bow out. In the case of Gasquet, this marked his final Roland Garros.


Naomi Osaka: A rough draw (made possible by her lack of a seeding); an entertaining battlel signs of top-shelf, winning form; ultimately a losing result. Four-time major champ goes out to Paula Badosa.


Arthur Fils: French star—and he is a star—wins two matches. Then forced to withdraw, unable to recover from his five-set passion play. He's only 20. Lots more chances.


The night session distribution: Even if the tournament stands by its reasoning to make this a 1950s-style men's only club—through the first week, zero women's matches made the night session—simply from an optics/PR perspective, you'd think they'd come up with an equitable workaround.

Recent NCAA women's singles champs: Emma Navarro  (2021 UVA) and Peyton Stearns (2022 Texas) were both seeded here. They won a combined four games.


Daniil Medvedev: A lovely presence. Who has gone by way of Novo Nordisk stock. Out of top 10 and without a title since spring 2023, former No.1 loses in Round 1.


Courtside signage: We all understand balance sheets. But the sponsored blocks ON THE FIELD OF PLAY are an absolute menace.

John and Patrick McEnroe have both had their say on the scheduling of the tennis calendar, coming to a unanimous decision.

Their thoughts were far from unpopular either, echoing the sentiment that so many players have complained about in the last few years.

It feels like as the sport grows the demand on the athletes only increases, pushing these athletes, who are already performing superhuman feats of physical exertion, to new heights.

Eventually, something dangerous will happen, with a few cautionary tales having already emerged.

Fortunately, Patrick has heard something that could ease the burden somewhat.

Speaking live on TNT Sports' US coverage, they took a moment amidst the chaos of Jack Draper's win over Joao Fonseca to discuss the ongoing scheduling problem tennis seems to have.

Alexei Popyrin has complained about the tennis calendar, as has Carlos Alcaraz, and now John McEnroe has echoed their concerns. He claimed: ‘A lot of players, mainly the ones that have lost complaining about the schedule. We've been talking about that for 40-50 years.

‘If they moved the Australian to later, that would give more time, but they don't want to give that up. The January slot. What do you think, in March?'

Patrick McEnroe offered a solution: ‘I'm hearing rumblings that it could move to February.'

‘That would be helpful,' John replied.

However, Pat was not completely optimistic: ‘Of course, there'd probably be another big tournament put in in early January, that's part of potentially the plan. Middle East hello?

‘It's pretty typical of all sports like in the NBA you see players taking nights off under contract. In tennis the difference is you don't play you don't get paid. No guaranteed contracts. Top players have big endorsement deals but even those normally have stipulations that the players have to play certain events or be ranked at a certain spot to collect the money.'

John then ended their chat with a simple message, noting: ‘Players should be able to play when they want, do what's best for themselves.'

As noted earlier, tennis must protect its stars rather than work them harder and harder.

They are the money-makers within the sport, and thus should always be given preferential treatment.

And yet, the stranglehold that the ATP and WTA seem to have over them is strange, thus explaining Novak Djokovic's formation of the PTPA.

A sort of union for players, this marks a big step in the right direction towards lessening the physical turmoil exacted upon the players.

At the moment, they are given just a slender month or so to enjoy some downtime before the season starts right back up again. It's unsustainable, and wholesale changes must be made before it's too late.

The three-time Grand Slam runner-up won through 6-2, 7-6(4), 6-1 in two hours and 30 minutes, and next plays 35th-ranked Dutch player Tallon Griekspoor.

"It's a tournament I look forward to the most during the year," said Zverev after his match on Court Philippe Chatrier.

"Especially this court is so special to me. I've had some of the best and worst memories of my life on this court.

"The crowd always supports me. The love story continues."

Zverev has reached at least the semi-finals on each of his last four appearances at Roland Garros.

"He (Cobolli) probably should have won the second set, but I kept fighting and then I had a bit of a mental advantage and it went my way."

Griekspoor battled past American Ethan Quinn 4-6, 6-1, 6-7(2), 6-1, 6-4 in three hours and 16 minutes.

Jack Draper laid down another marker in his standout season on Saturday at Roland Garros, where he dispatched the supremely talented #NextGenATP Brazilian Joao Fonseca 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 to reach the fourth round in Paris for the first time.

Hype was high surrounding Draper's second Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with 18-year-old Fonseca, who had not dropped a set en route to reaching the third round at a major for the first time.

However, the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion Fonseca struggled for consistency. He was unable to live with Draper's power and physicality in the hot and lively conditions on Court Suzanne-Lenglen. The British lefty hit his heavy topspin forehand with depth and was relaxed for large periods, striking with liquid power to dominate the brutal baseline exchanges.

The 23-year-old won 93 per cent of his first-serve points and committed 20 unforced errors to Fonseca's 38, according to Infosys Stats, to advance after one hour and 49 minutes.

"I played good. The conditions were quite difficult out here. I felt that the first set was really key," Draper said. "Then I kind of got on top of him, used my forehand well, served well and mentally it was a good performance from me and I am happy to be in the second week here."

Draper arrived at Roland Garros having not won a match in two previous appearances at the clay-court major. Physically firing, No. 5 in the PIF ATP Rankings is a different proposition this year, though.

The lefty captured his maiden ATP Masters 1000 title in Indian Wells in March ­– defeating Fonseca en route – and then reached the championship match on clay in Madrid. Holding a 25-6 record on the season, Draper will continue the quest for his first major against Alexander Bublik, who beat Portuguese qualifier Henrique Rocha 7-5, 6-1, 6-2.

"In my first two rounds I played in the night time and playing against Gael [Monfils] the other night I didn't feel I could hit the ball past him," Draper said on the conditions at this year's Roland Garros. "The guy is so quick and it was so cold. But today the ball was getting up more and the faster conditions help me more."



Fonseca defeated Hubert Hurkacz and Pierre-Hugues Herbert to advance to the third round in Paris. Earlier this season the 18-year-old upset Andrey Rublev at the Australian Open and captured his maiden ATP Tour title at the 250 event in Buenos Aires.

The Brazilian was backed by vocal support throughout his three matches in the French capital but was unable to give them anything to cheer about against Draper, overhitting all too often. The 18-year-old leaves Roland Garros up 10 places at No. 55 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

"Joao is someone who has come onto the Tour and caught the attention of everyone, the players, the fans. He is an incredible young player and so much to come from him," Draper said on Fonseca. "I think today maybe a bit of experience [was the difference]. He hasn't played as many Grand Slams as myself but I think he has an incredibly bright future at the top of the game."

Jack Draper has reached the fourth round at the past three Grand Slams

French Open 2025

Dates: 25 May-8 June Venue: Roland Garros

Coverage: Live radio commentaries across 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and app

Britain's Jack Draper underlined his status as one of the world's leading players with a ruthlessly efficient win over Brazilian rising star Joao Fonseca in the French Open third round.

Fifth seed Draper was a cut above his 18-year-old opponent in a 6-2 6-4 6-2 victory.

Fonseca only broke into the world's top 100 earlier this year, but has created a buzz with his explosive style and ferocious forehand.

Draper quickly diffused what could have been a tricky encounter, showing his superior quality and experience from the start.

"Joao has caught the attention of the players and the fans. Today my experience came through," Draper said.

The 23-year-old Englishman, who had never won a match at Roland Garros until this week, will face unseeded Kazakh Alexander Bublik in the fourth round.

Later on Saturday, Cameron Norrie joined Draper in the last 16 after beating fellow Briton Jacob Fearnley in straight sets.

It marks the first time since 1963 that two British men have reached the fourth round at the clay-court Grand Slam.

Draper has developed into a top player with ambitions of challenging for the biggest titles over the past 12 months.

Possessing tools which are effective across all surfaces has seen Draper turn into a French Open contender.

Reaching the Madrid Open final was an early sign of improvement and his performances in Paris have backed that up.

Patience was needed in victories over Italy's Mattia Bellucci and French veteran Gael Monfils. It was similar against Fonseca - by biding his time in the rallies and picking attacking shots at the right time, Draper quickly gained control.

In increasingly faster conditions, the speed and spin of Draper's forehand was particularly difficult for Fonseca to handle as the Briton quickly went a double break up.

A double fault for 30-30 in the eighth game offered Fonseca faint hope, before Draper rediscovered his first serve and returned well to take the opening set in 29 minutes.

Momentum - and crowd support - started to build for Fonseca in a tighter second set, but Draper quickly extinguished hope with solid service games.

He broke for a 4-3 lead which - after saving two break points in the 10th game - was enough for a two-set lead.

Draper continued to play smartly at the start of the third set, mixing depth of return with deft drop-shots on his way to wrapping up victory.

The hype around Fonseca has continued to grow - but this was another reminder of how he still needs time to develop.

A carnival mood led by thousands of Brazilians has followed Fonseca from Melbourne to Paris this year.

Fans patiently queue to see his matches on the smaller courts at the majors, with some people setting up camp at Roland Garros hours before his first two matches.

But his clash against Draper being switched to the ticket-only Court Suzanne Lenglen late on Friday evening - after home favourite Arthur Fils withdrew from the tournament injured - worked in the Briton's favour.

While there was plenty of Brazilian support - easily identified by splashes of yellow and green national flags and Selecao football shirts - it was far from a difficult atmosphere for Draper to handle.

"How old is he, 18? Pretty impressive," said Draper. 

"I think it's only going to go up for him. I think it's going to be scary what he's going to be able to achieve."

Novak Djokovic continues to defy the aging curve with his achievements. The 38-year-old is fresh from capturing his 100th tour-level trophy and is this week chasing a record 25th major title at Roland Garros.

Yet while some still question Djokovic's ability to compete at the highest level, Hologic WTA No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka sent a clear message in defence of the former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings and his eye-catching achievements.

“You are trying to put as much pressure as you can on Novak. Leave him alone,” Sabalenka candidly said in a press conference in Paris when asked about Djokovic's longevity. “Look at him. He's fit, strong. Mentally, physically, I think he's ready to play another two, three years. He's doing really well.

“Of course, [there are] ups and downs, everyone has [them]. I believe the older you get, the tougher it gets to stay consistent on the level. But we see whenever he's ready, whenever he's healthy and fit, he's there, and he's playing great tennis.”



While Sabalenka acknowledged the inevitable challenges that come with a prolonged tennis career, she emphasised Djokovic's proven ability to rise to the occasion.

Referring to 14-time Roland Garros champion Rafael Nadal's farewell ceremony Sunday, where his greatest rivals Djokovic, Roger Federer and Andy Murray were present, Sabalenka also pointed to the absence of the ‘Big Four' as a poignant reminder of the sport's shifting landscape.

“Imagine if he retires tomorrow, then everyone is going to be sad, no? Then there is another 10, 15 years for Jannik [Sinner] and [Carlos] Alcaraz to become one of the greatest,” added Sabalenka. “But just let him be.

“It was so sad to see the ceremony, the ‘Big Four' were on the court and you understand that three of them are retired. Everyone is missing their games. So let's just let Novak be there to show and fight and show his greatness and to inspire that generation.”

The 14th seed pulled out of the tournament on Friday before he was set to play Russia's Andrey Rublev.

Rublev will receive a walkover into the last 16 and could next meet world number one Jannik Sinner.

"I have a stress fracture. I had to make a decision and we decided with my team it was better to stop now because it could be for only four to six weeks," Fils said on Saturday.

The 20-year-old Fils beat Spain's Jaume Munar in five sets on Thursday but needed treatment for a back problem and also dealt with cramp.

"I had some issue with the back for a long time, and during the match against Munar it gets worse. Then I did some exams. The exams were not good at all," he continued.

Fils had said that without the help of the crowd on Court Suzanne Lenglen he was not sure if he could have finished the match against Munar.

"If I was pushing myself too much, I would probably stop for a couple of months," he said.

"This is not what we are trying to do, so yeah, had to make a choice."

Fils said he was still hopeful of playing the third Grand Slam of the year on grass at Wimbledon from June 30, where he reached the last 16 in 2024.

"I'll try to see if I can be ready. I'm not at all sure. It's a big question mark. It will take as long as it takes," Fils added.

The Parisian was also forced to retire at the Australian Open in the third round against compatriot Ugo Humbert due to a left ankle injury.

Fils' withdrawal from Roland Garros extends the host nation's wait for a first men's champion at Roland Garros since Yannick Noah in 1983.

French Open Star's Wimbledon Dreams in Jeopardy After Controversial Injury Claims

In a shocking turn of events, French tennis sensation Arthur Fils might have to sit out of Wimbledon after being embroiled in a controversy surrounding his recent injury withdrawal from the French Open. The French No. 1, known for his fierce determination on the court, was forced to pull out of his home Grand Slam tournament due to a debilitating back issue, casting doubts on his upcoming participation at the prestigious Wimbledon Championships.

Fils, who valiantly battled through back problems to secure a thrilling victory over Jaume Munar in a marathon match, later faced accusations from his opponent of feigning injury. Munar insinuated that Fils' injury was not genuine, suggesting that the young star was only suffering from cramps rather than a serious back injury. However, Fils silenced the doubters by confirming the presence of a stress fracture in his back, putting his Wimbledon campaign in jeopardy.

The 20-year-old phenom disclosed the severity of his injury, stating, “I had some issue with the back since a long time, and during the match against Munar it gets worse. Then I did some exams. The exams were not good at all. Got some stress fracture.” Fils further elaborated on the recurring nature of his back problems, revealing, “It's the lower back. I got this issue a couple of times already when I was young. Yeah, L-5. So yeah, I got some issues like this in the past already.”

Despite his determination to recover in time for Wimbledon, Fils faces an uphill battle as he navigates his rehabilitation process. The young star, who impressed at Wimbledon last year by reaching the fourth round, acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding his return, stating, “I will try to be ready for Wimbledon, but we are not sure. To be honest, we don't know. Let's see.”

While Fils' withdrawal from upcoming grass tournaments casts a shadow of doubt over his Wimbledon prospects, the tennis world remains captivated by the unfolding drama surrounding the French prodigy. As Fils focuses on his recovery and rehabilitation, fans are left wondering whether he will be able to showcase his talent on the grass courts of Wimbledon this year.

With the tennis fraternity eagerly awaiting updates on Fils' condition and potential comeback, the specter of injury looms large over the promising star's future in the sport. Will Arthur Fils defy the odds and make a triumphant return to Wimbledon, or will his dreams of glory be shattered by the relentless demands of professional tennis? Only time will tell as the tennis world holds its breath in anticipation of Fils' next move.

Arthur Fils has revealed that he could be sidelined for four to six weeks and risks missing Wimbledon after withdrawing from his home Grand Slam tournament. The French No. 1 overcame back issues to beat Jaume Munar in a thrilling four-hour and 25-minute match on Thursday and ripped his shirt off in celebration when he won.

Munar later suggested that Fils wasn't really injured and was only cramping. But the 14th seed announced his withdrawal from the tournament the night before his third-round match against Andrey Rublev. On Saturday morning, he confirmed he had a stress fracture in his back that will leave him in a race against time to return at the All England Club next month.

“I had some issue with the back since a long time, and during the match against Munar it gets worse. Then I did some exams. The exams were not good at all. Got some stress fracture,” Fils said.

“Yeah, whatever, we decide with the team it was better to stop now, because if I'm stopping now, I could stop for only four to six weeks. If I was pushing myself too much, I would probably stop for a couple of months.”

“It's the lower back. I got this issue a couple of times already when I was young. Yeah, L-5. So yeah, I got some issues like this in the past already.”

The 20-year-old explained why his back had caused him so much trouble, adding: “It's an injury that happens quite often when you are a child. It's a stress fracture injury.

“It happened to me twice. I had to wear a back brace. Then it healed. But also, my lower back is arched, so then I had a bone marrow edema. It's coming back right now. So I have to find a way to cure that and to get past that.”

And the stress fracture could now stop him from playing the upcoming grass season. Fils

had entered into grass tournaments in ‘s-Hertogenbosch and Halle to prepare for Wimbledon.

But he has confirmed that he will have to withdraw from some events and Wimbledon - where he reached the fourth round last year - remains up in the air.

The world No. 14 continued: “I have to see with the team, with the doctor. For sure I'm going to skip some tournaments. I don't know which one yet. I will try to be ready for Wimbledon, but we are not sure. To be honest, we don't know. Let's see.

“It's on hold for the moment. It will take time. I'm only 20 years old. I don't want to be in a hurry on the tour. I don't need to ramp up everything. I need to be ready for the hard court season, for the end of the year, and this is for the best.”

Fils received an off-court medical time-out before the fourth set of his second-round clash with Munar on Thursday. Eventually, painkillers and adrenaline kicked in, and the home crowd helped him come back from a break down in the decider to win 7-6 7-6 2-6 0-6 6-4.

“During the match against Munar, at the end of the second set, I said, ‘You know what, I'm going to call the doctor and I'm going to take painkiller',” the Frenchman recalled.

“But then I understood that the back was not good at all, but because of the crowd, I could make it in the fifth. But yeah, then no chance to play.”

But Munar wasn't convinced of Fils' injuries after he won five of the last six games in a row. On Thursday, the Spaniard said: “He was seen by the doctor for a suspected back injury, but I'm convinced he suffered cramps. In that case, he couldn't have been treated.

“I wasn't bothered by the break, but that's the way it is. If you have a real injury, you don't play the fifth set like he did.”

While Fils will be devastated to pull out of his home Grand Slam tournament, the 20-year-old will at the very least be able to watch his beloved PSG in the Champions League final on Saturday night, though he won't be taking a last-minute flight to Munich and will follow it on TV.

Teenager from Geneva is using the ATP Challenger Tour to help make the difficult transition from junior star to full-time pro.ByFlorian HeerPublished May 31, 2025 copy_link

Switzerland has long been a powerhouse in world tennis, with legends like Roger Federer, Stan Wawrinka, and Martina Hingis leaving a lasting mark on the sport. But the future also looks bright, especially on the men's side. While Dominic Stricker, Leandro Riedi, and Jérôme Kym have already made a name for themselves, another young Swiss talent is stepping into the spotlight: Kilian Feldbausch.The 19-year-old from Geneva is considered one of Switzerland's most promising young players. In November 2023, he celebrated his first title on the ITF World Tennis Tour in Boca Raton, a key milestone in his professional journey.“I had just played the South America swing and faced some good players. I came to Florida with good rhythm. Ending the tournament as the winner was obviously great,” Feldbausch said, describing his maiden title on the Pro Circuit.Unlike many of today's power players, Feldbausch relies more on tactical finesse than brute force. “I'm a solid player, not like John Isner with a big serve. I always try to find a solution on the court,” he explained.His goal is clear: to successfully manage the often-difficult transition from junior to professional tennis. And he's already shown that he's up for the challenge. In November 2023, Feldbausch reached his first ATP Challenger Tour final at the eó Hotels Maspalomas Challenger in Gran Canaria.“The Challenger Tour is a big challenge for me. But I like that. You have to be strong physically and mentally,“ Feldbausch said.

Setbacks and ComebackFeldbausch's journey has not been without obstacles. In spring 2023, two foot fractures set him back significantly. Prior to that, he had shown impressive results on the Junior Circuit - reaching the semifinals at the Australian Open, quarterfinals at Wimbledon and the US Open, and climbing as high as World No. 5 in the ITF Junior Rankings.“That was a tough time. I lost almost every match when I came back. But later I was able to regain some confidence,” he said during the Challenger event in the Canary Islands.In April of the same year, he underwent a preventative hip surgery. But by September, he returned to the tour and went on to win a second ITF World Tennis Tour title during the winter in Antalya, Turkey. Now, Feldbausch is aiming for a full, injury-free season.Currently ranked World No. 473, Feldbausch often has to fight his way through qualifying rounds. But he has proven he can rise to the occasion, reaching the main draw at Challenger events in both Santiago de Chile and Menorca, Spain.

Tennis Runs in the FamilyFeldbausch comes from a true tennis lineage. His grandfather, Franz Feldbausch, played Davis Cup for Germany in 1956. His father, Michael, reached a career-high ATP Ranking of 706. His mother, Cathy Caverzasio - now also his coach - was a top WTA player, peaking at World No. 34 in 1990.“Both of my parents coach me. My uncle is also sometimes with me when my mother has to work back home. It helps me a lot to have my family around,” Feldbausch explained.After a challenging year marked by injury and recovery, Feldbausch is now focused and determined. “I played really well toward the end of the 2023 season and of course I want to keep improving.”With a solid foundation, strong family support, and renewed confidence, Kilian Feldbausch seems poised to become a regular presence on the ATP Challenger Tour - and perhaps, in the not-too-distant future, make headlines on the sport's biggest stages.

Henrique Rocha arrived at Roland Garros having lost nine of 10 matches, in part due to an abdominal injury he suffered earlier in the season. His lone victory during the stretch came against the No. 647 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. 

But momentum can add up quickly on the ATP Tour, and that is what has happened in Paris for the rising Portuguese star. Following one of the toughest moments of his young career, Rocha has thrust himself into his brightest spotlight yet. The 21-year-old will face Alexander Bublik on Saturday to reach the fourth round at the clay-court major.

After rallying from two sets down against Miami champion Jakub Mensik in the second round, Rocha focussed on the group of Portuguese players rather than himself. Rocha and Nuno Borges, who lost his match Friday, became the first men from their country to reach the third round at Roland Garros in tournament history and the first Portuguese duo to make the third round at the same Grand Slam tournament.

“We have a great team. We have a fitness coach, psychologist, nutritionists, of course coaches, physios. We have everything we need to be very good players,” Rocha said in a press conference, referencing himself, Borges and 21-year-old Portuguese Jaime Faria, who cracked the Top 100 this year. “The three of us were practising together. It's also very good to always improve with each other.”



Rocha is the son of two big tennis fans, Marta and Jorge. His brother Francisco played the sport, so Henrique would go to watch and help at his practice sessions. Inevitably, Rocha picked up the sport and trained in Maia until age 15, when he moved to Lisbon to train with the Portuguese Tennis Federation.

Former World No. 59 Rui Machado, the technical director for the federation, called one of his old coaches, Andre Lopes, about working with Rocha. Lopes had not personally met Rocha until this year, when they began their partnership alongside Pedro Sousa.

“I always heard that he had a lot of potential with shots that are quite hard and plays fast, and he's very strong physically. He has a very strong competitive mentality. This is what I heard in the past and obviously before starting working with him,” Lopes told ATPTour.com. “Once I started to work with him, that's exactly what I noticed, he has a great potential. 

“His shots are really, really fast and he can play really hard, which I think is a big advantage for him, together with his competitive mentality.”

They have been working hard to make Rocha's game more stable and organise his firepower in the best possible way to take advantage of those tools. Their efforts faced a setback in February when Rocha hurt his abdominal during the warmup for a match. After a break that lasted around a month, he struggled with a lack of matches, which led to difficulty finding rhythm and his ensuing skid.

 

Since the ATP Challenger Tour event in Estoril last month, Rocha has been competing well and moving in the right direction, according to Lopes. That effort has been rewarded on the Parisian clay, where the Portuguese won a two-hour, 59-minute three-setter in the final round of qualifying against Luca Van Assche and then back-to-back five-setters against Nikoloz Basilashvili and Mensik in the first two rounds of the main draw.

“Luckily it's paying off in a big tournament,” Lopes said. “It could have paid off maybe two weeks ago or two months later, but I think it's a good tournament to pay off. So hopefully we'll keep going.”


The Mensik match was particularly challenging. The soaring Czech led by two sets and a break against an opponent who had never played a five-set match before the first round.

“I would say the challenge of being two sets down against a player like Mensik was a huge challenge,” Lopes said. “We believed from the beginning that if he would play at a good level, he would have his chances to win. But being two sets down and a break down in the third makes it very, very tough to come back.”


It was another sign of progress for Rocha, who is up to No. 148 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. He now owns a 6-3 tour-level record according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.


“He's breaking his own barriers, setting challenges day by day. Somehow, everything is happening quite fast,” Lopes said. “But I think at the same time, it's very conscious of what he's doing, still focusing on the small details, trying to improve little things, even in the warmup, before the match, we chat a lot after the match.


“So I see him very, very focused, very calm, and handling in a very good way, the emotions connected to an experience like this.”


Lopes explained that it is important for Rocha to remain work grounded in this moment and remain focused on the process of working hard each day.


“He needs to work hard every week, every month of the season, and sometimes it will pay off, sometimes it won't,” Lopes said. “But at the end, the mentality of getting better and improving as a player needs to be there, basically, until he ends his career.”

Emma Raducanu's clay season ended with a second-round loss at Roland Garros, as defending champion Iga Swiatek proved too strong, brushing the Brit aside 6-1, 6-2. With the French Open behind her, Raducanu has already set her sights on the grass season, eager to build on her growing momentum ahead of her local major, Wimbledon. 

The 22-year-old will open her grass-court season at the Queen's Club Championships, where she has received a wildcard for the tournament's long-awaited WTA return. It's a stacked field, with Jessica Pegula, Elena Rybakina, Naomi Osaka, and Coco Gauff all set to compete in London. 

From there, she heads to Berlin for the German Open, another WTA 500 event with a star-studded line-up that includes Aryna Sabalenka, Madison Keys, and Pegula once again. Raducanu will wrap up her grass-court swing at Wimbledon, which stars on Monday June 30, hoping for a deep run on home soil.

Raducanu's 2025 season has been a story of steady progress, with key wins on the clay helping her climb the rankings. From starting the year outside the top 40 to now sitting at No 37, her form has been building since a strong showing in Miami. The early loss in Paris may have been a setback, but Raducanu also reached the Round of 16 at Rome, losing to Coco Gauff.

Raducanu has made three main draw appearances at Wimbledon, with her best showing coming as a fourth-round finish in her debut in 2021. That remarkable run as an 18-year-old captured the imagination of the British public and set the stage for her US Open triumph later that year. 

She matched her best Wimbledon result in 2024, reaching the fourth round once again. Overall, she holds a 7–3 record at the All England Club, a solid 70% win rate that she will hope to improve this summer.

Just one day after news broke of Stefanos Tsitsipas' new partnership with the former No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Goran Ivanisevic, the Greek star publicly shared his excitement.

“I'm happy to begin a new chapter with Goran Ivanisevic joining my team as coach,” Tsitsipas wrote in a statement on Instagram Stories. “Goran's experience, passion for the sport, and champion's mindset are things I greatly respect, and I'm looking forward to the journey ahead with him by my side. I'm optimistic about what we can build together.”

Ivanisevic was a standout player — earning his place in the International Tennis Hall of Fame — and also helped Novak Djokovic to great heights as the Serbian's longtime coach.



The 26-year-old Tsitsipas also thanked coaches Kerei Abakar and Dimitris Chatzinikolaou for their help.

“I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude too Kerei and Dimitris for their dedication, support, and work over the past few months,” Tsitsipas wrote. “Working with them has been a meaningful chapter in my journey, and I'm deeply thankful for the effort and commitment they brought to the team.”

Tsitsipas owns an 18-11 record this season according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He is No. 26 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

Yuki Tsunoda was left searching for answers after ending Qualifying for the Spanish Grand Prix down in 20th and last place, with the Japanese driver admitting that he realistically is “a bit less hopeful” about his prospects for race day.

It had been a tricky start to the weekend in Barcelona for Tsunoda during Friday's practice sessions as he remained some way off the pace of team mate Max Verstappen across FP1 and FP2, taking P9 and P13 in those sessions respectively.

After admitting that he was “struggling”, the 25-year-old's fortunes did not improve come Saturday, with the #22 car exiting Qualifying in Q1 meaning that he will line up on the back row of the grid for Sunday's race.

Tsunoda faced a difficult Qualifying in Spain at the wheel of the RB21, with the Japanese driver exiting Q1 in P20

“It's pretty tough,” Tsunoda said of his session. “Throughout the week we… I tried to solve the issue as much as possible. I was mentioning from FP1 that I had some strange issue that [the car] was just not gripping at all.

“We tried our best to solve the issue but I don't think we [were] able to cure it. Whatever we made in terms of set-up change, it's always a kind of cluster feeling and it's not really giving an overall step forwards.

“It's a shame, honestly the lap itself was okay. There's not much [where] I had a mistake or whatever in both laps. Even probably if we put the three sets [of tyres on], I don't think I would have been able to… With that pace, it's going to be tough.”

Pushed on how he will reset for the 66-lap encounter on Sunday, Tsunoda suggested that there could be other issues at play for the race.

“The thing is it also applies to the long-run pace as well,” he explained. “[In] FP2, the long-run pace was really bad.

“It just isn't a good feeling, so far what I feel is the car is eating its tyres a lot, and every lap whatever I do I have the degradation. But, anyway, hopefully the set-up change made a step forward. I'm hoping it will be better, but realistically I'm a little bit less hopeful.”

Carlos Sainz cited a myriad of problems after he was knocked out in the first stage of Qualifying for his home race at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, leaving him eager to break into the top 10 in Sunday's Grand Prix.

The Spaniard has never failed to score points around this track in his F1 career, but exiting Qualifying in P18 leaves him with the prospect of a challenging recovery drive in order to maintain his success here.

Williams have undergone a resurgence this year and regularly find themselves with at least one car in Q3, but neither Sainz nor Alex Albon were able to put together the necessary lap to progress, with the latter just missing out in P11.

One issue that Sainz experienced was an unusual kind of traffic as Franco Colapinto got stuck at the end of the pit lane towards the end of Q1, leaving the Williams in an unexpected position on the track and reduced time to improve his lap.

‘I thought we had the pace to go to Q3' – Disappointed Sainz explains how he ended up P18

“Honestly, it was a very tricky Qualifying,” Sainz said following the session. “I thought today we had the pace to go through to Q3 if we put things together, but unfortunately we were out of position after Franco [Colapinto] had a problem in the pit lane.

“We went out really late in the middle of nowhere and we had to pass five or six cars on our push lap. Had loads of dirty air which compromised my performance, and in the end when the field is so tight, I think we were one-tenth and a half from P7 – we were P18.

“We're going to try our best to make it back to the points. Tomorrow will be a good day to try something different and try and come back.

“At the same time, obviously it's Barcelona and P18 is not the best position to start, but we're going to do everything possible.”

Albon could score points for the fifth consecutive race this weekend

His team mate Alex Albon, who has only gone out in Q2 on three occasions this season, similarly suffered due to dirty air and traffic – as he referred to Ollie Bearman's Haas as “dirty” over the radio, alleging that they were “purposefully slow in Sector 3”.

It had been a tough weekend for Albon even before Qualifying began, having sat out of FP1 to allow Victor Martins to make his F1 debut and subsequently experiencing a braking issue that limited him to just five laps in FP3.

He explained: “It's a shame to miss out on Q3 but at the same time I'm really happy – that's the first time I've been through to Q2 [in Spain] with the Williams, and almost in Q3 so it shows all of us that we're going in the right direction. We still have some work to do.”

Reflecting on his radio message, Albon added: “It's fine margins. Honestly, Ollie's not in the way, I don't have to brake and I'm not getting disturbed by the object of his car, let's say. We just carry so much dirty air, and the dirty air was a bit too dirty for Sector 3 and I missed out, but that's how it is.”

As country music fans descend upon Nashville for CMA Fest 2025 from June 5 – 8, they'll get to celebrate country music queen Reba McEntire's epic career in a new spot called The Reba House. According to a press release from her record label, the temporary space will be filled to the brim with memorabilia celebrating McEntire's career, including her iconic chair from “The Voice” set. 

Although McEntire is not scheduled to perform this year at CMA Fest, fans will get to immerse themselves in all aspects of her decades-long career and be the first fans to pre-order her upcoming “The Hits” album, due in October. 

A post shared by Academy of Country Music (ACM) (@acmawards)

In addition to trying out McEntire's iconic red chair from “The Voice,” where she'll return as a coach for season 28, the new Reba House will also feature a replica of the tavern on her hit NBC sitcom, “Happy's Place” and a Realtor.com photobooth where visitors can get a “keepsake pic in a fan-favorite scene.”

Memorabilia inside The Reba House will include a curated collection of outfits from McEntire's concert wardrobes, including the iconic red dress she performed in at the 1993 Country Music Awards and years later at the 2018 Academy of Country Music Awards while singing a duet with Kelly Clarkson.

According to MCA, merchandise displays inside The Reba House will offer fans a look at her collectible Funko Pop! figure, a Dillard's Showcase of clothes from McEntire's fashion line, pairs of her REBA by Justin boots, and her bestselling book “Not That Fancy.”

The new Reba House, located at Fan Fair X in Music City Center, will be open each day of CMA Fest from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. 

Fans who visit The Reba House will also be able to pre-order McEntire's upcoming album “The Hits” on exclusive vinyl and get an exclusive Reba poster. Slated for an October 31 release, “The Hits” will be the “first-ever, career-spanning collection of McEntire's most beloved songs,” per MCA. 

Side one of the new album will feature her hits “Can't Even Get The Blues No More,” “Somebody Should Leave,” “Whoever's In New England,” “Does He Love You (with Linda Davis),” “Is There Life Out There,” “Consider Me Gone,” and “Turn On The Radio.” 

Side two's track list features “Why Haven't I Heard From You,” “The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia,” “For My Broken Heart,” “I'm A Survivor,” “Back To God,” and “Fancy.” 

Meanwhile, McEntire's new hit song with Miranda Lambert and Lainey Wilson, “Trailblazer,” is available everywhere music can be streamed. The trio debuted the song at the CMAs on May 9 and gave a surprise performance of the tune during McEntire's May 30 set at the Nashville Rodeo.

Disney's instant blockbuster 'Lilo & Stitch' is eyeing a second-weekend domestic haul of $60 million-plus, while Tom Cruise's final 'M:I' movie sits safely at No. 2 after zooming past $100 million on Friday.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	While its fate isn't yet sealed, there's a good chance the multiverse-minded Karate Kid: Legends will open behind expectations at the domestic box office, despite teaming original star Ralph Macchio and beloved action legend Jackie Chan, who starred in the 2010 redux.


	Sony is predicting a third-place opening for the male-fueled film in the $21 million to $23 million range (rival studios show the movie coming in closer to $19 million). Heading into the weekend, tracking had it at $25 million; three weeks ago, that number was a far more promising $35 million). Regardless of where it lands, Sony remains confident that the PG-13 film will sport strong chops, thanks to an A- CinemaScore and solid exits. And its net production budget was a modest $45 million before marketing.

					Ralph Macchio Insisted That 'Karate Kid: Legends' Delay Its Release Until After 'Cobra Kai'		
			









	Critics are far more divided than audiences when it comes to Karate Kid: Legends, which features Ben Wang in the titular role. His character is mentored by both the characters played by Macchio, star of the classic 1984 movie and, far more recently, Netflix's acclaimed Cobra Kai series, which ran for six seasons and ended earlier this year.


	In 2010, Sony successfully reinvigorated the franchise with The Karate Kid, starring Chan opposite Jaden Smith. The movie, opening to $55 million domestically, was one of the year's top hits. 


	Box office pundits are already speculating that franchise fans may have stated by Cobra Kai, at least for the time being. The series was viewed as a sequel to the first three films; the threequel was released in 1989. They add that middling reviews for Legends certainly aren't helping.


	And then there's the Lilo & Stitch and Mission: Impossible factor. Both movies continue to do strong business after serving up a record Memorial Day weekend at the box office.

	











	The bounty was led by Disney's Lilo & Stitch, which exceeded all expectations in opening to nearly $183 million domestically and shattering numerous records. The film, which easily remains No. 1 by leaps and bounds, is expected to earn $60 million or more this weekend, one of the best sophomore showings ever for a Disney live-action redo. Lilo should finish Sunday with a massive domestic haul of $280 million.


	Paramount and Skydance's Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning, starring Tom Cruise in his final turn as uber spy Ethan Hunt, is firmly seated in second place with an estimated sophomore outing of $28 million for a domestic tally of $122 million. It crossed $100 million on Friday in only its eighth day in release after opening to a franchise-best $79 million over the long holiday weekend.


Karate Kid isn't the only new nationwide offering. A24's highly anticipated thriller Bring Her Back, starring Sally Hawkings, is headed for a pleasing fifth-place finish with $6.5 million-$8 million.


	At the specialty box office, Wes Anderson's The Phoenician Scheme is opening in six locations and is on course to score the top per-location average of the year following the film's debut at the Cannes Film Festival. Focus Features and Indian Paintbrush partnered on the film.

"Yes you did that Tay!!!" the singer and actress wrote.

Selena Gomez is celebrating her longtime friend Taylor Swift's latest victory.


	On Friday (May 30), the Rare Beauty founder showed her support for Swift after the pop superstar revealed she had officially purchased back the masters to her first six albums.


	“YES YOU DID THAT TAY!!!” Gomez wrote in all caps on her Instagram Story. “SO proud!”


	Swift made the announcement earlier in the day by posting photos of herself with the covers of her first six albums on Instagram, directing fans to a heartfelt letter on her website. In the lengthy message, the 14-time Grammy winner reflected on the emotional journey of reclaiming her music.




			Trending on Billboard		







	 “To say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it,” she wrote. “To my fans, you know how important this has been to me — so much so that I meticulously re-recorded and released four of my albums, calling them Taylor's Version.”

	











	“The passionate support you showed those albums and the success story you turned The Eras Tour into is why I was able to buy back my music,” the singer added. “I can't thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now.”

	











	Swift acquired the masters from private equity firm Shamrock Capital for somewhere around $360 million, sources tell Billboard. The sale comes six years after Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings purchased her catalog from Big Machine's Scott Borchetta in 2019, later selling his ownership of Swift's music to Shamrock in late 2020.


	Of the pop superstar's purchase, Braun tells Billboard, “I am happy for her.”


	Gomez and Swift's friendship spans nearly two decades. The two first met in 2008 through the Jonas Brothers — Swift was dating Joe at the time, while Gomez was linked to Nick. Since then, they've remained close, consistently supporting each other through the many highs and lows of their personal lives and careers. Check out a full timeline of their longtime friendship here.

“On August 4, I will be back and I am pissed off.”

So said Mike Judge as the voice of Hank Hill to close Friday's “King of the Hill” reunion and revival panel at the ATX Television Festival. Fans packed a sold-out Paramount Theater in Austin, TX to celebrate the first 13 seasons of the Fox animated comedy and get an exclusive preview of Season 14, straight from the series' co-creators Judge and Greg Daniels, executive producer and new showrunner Saladin K. Patterson, and members of the voice cast Pamela Adlon (who won an Emmy for portraying Bobby Hill), Lauren Tom (who voices Minh and Connie Souphanousinphone), and Toby Huss (who voiced Kahn Souphanousinphone and Cotton Hill in the original run and will replace the late Johnny Hardwicke as Dale Gribble in the revival).

In addition to a teaser that updates the original credits (which you can watch below), attendees were treated to a clip of Hank and Peggy returning to Texas after spending several years working in Saudi Arabia, as well as a longer teaser with plenty of scenes featuring a now 21-year-old Bobby.

“Where it clicked for me was when we started talking about aging the characters,” Judge said about deciding to seriously pursue a new season. “Because it's such a grounded realistic show, it just felt right that they would be older.”

In Season 14, Hank and Peggy are now retired and have just moved back to Texas. Bobby is working as a successful sushi chef in Dallas — the news of which elicited a chorus of boos from the loyal Austin crowd. Worse still, it's a “German sushi robata” restaurant, which means Bobby is using charcoal, not propane, to grill his food. Given Hank's lifelong devotion to liquified petroleum gas, the gasps from the gathered fans were well-warranted. 

“You didn't see that one coming did you?” Huss said, prodding the audience.

“As an adult, he's become more centered and almost a little bit more like his dad,” Adlon said.

Tom revealed that Connie is practicing ENM — “ethical non-monogamy” — while Daniels reported that Hank taking a new job overseas was pretty hard on his friend Bill (voiced by Stephen Root). “I think I finished Netflix,” Daniels said, quoting the character's reaction to Hank's return.

Hank, meanwhile, has mixed feelings about being back in America. Although the initial clip showed him so thankful to be in Texas that he drops to his knees and kisses the ground, what's waiting for him isn't the same Arlin he left behind. 

 










“Hank kinda liked that women were covered up and modest [in Saudi Arabia],” Judge said. “He comes back and there's a bike lane and a scooter lane. […] He's looking at all the stuff that's happened in the last 15 years, and there's a whole world of things that would annoy Hank.”

“Peggy is a character who feels she can do anything, and now she has the free time to do it,” Patterson said. “So we get to see Peggy try some new things to see what post-retirement life looks like for her. But at the end of the day, this is still going to be about their relationship, supporting each other and encouraging each other. We just have a little fun with their neuroses.”

With Dale Gribble, original voice actor Johnny Hardwicke recorded six episodes before his death in 2023. Huss will take over the role for the rest of the run.

“That you guys trusted me to do his voice again is really humbling,” Huss said. “I'm not trying to copy Johnny as much as I'm trying to be Johnny and hope Dale comes out of that. … All I'm trying to do is hold onto that Daleness. We love our Johnny, and we're so sad he's not here.”

Regarding any changes to the character himself, Huss hinted at another major pivot for a man known for taking big swings.

“Dale's back doing his thing, man,” Huss said. “Dale now is a little bit left of right, where he used to be all the way right. Now he's been out-righted by the right with the conspiracy theory stuff. We'll see how Dale reacts to the new world. We'll see what he can do.”

 










“King of the Hill” originally ran from 1997 – 2009, spanning 13 seasons and 259 episodes — all of which are available on Hulu. The new season will premiere August 4 with 10 episodes. Watch the teaser below.

The singer and humanitarian schooled the podcaster on the real world impact of his billionaire friend's DOGE cuts, while Musk fires back on social media. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	U2 frontman schooled podcaster Joe Rogan on his frequent support and defense of Elon Musk. 


	The singer discussed the impact of the Trump administration and Musk's Department of Government Efficiency's proposed cuts to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) — which is considered the largest source of international aid to more than 120 countries via delivering food programs, clean water and infectious disease medical assistance. The organization's efforts are often credited for saving lives at the cost of pennies on the dollar.

					Bono Weighs in on Trump-Bruce Springsteen Drama: "There's Only One Boss in America"		
			









Bono has been undertaking humanitarian trips to Africa and other nations since the early 1980s and has a history of working with USAID. He cited a study that estimated the DOGE cuts to the department will result in more than 300,000 deaths worldwide — more than 200,000 of them children suffering from malnutrition, malaria and pneumonia. The cuts, he claimed, have already resulted in food, water and medical aide being stranded due to mass layoffs.


	“There's food rotting in boats and warehouses,” Bono said during a Friday appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience (video clip below). “There is 50,000 tons of food. The people who knew the codes — who were responsible for distributing that aid — were fired. That's not America, is it?”


	Bono said he understands why people would want to downsize big government but says steep cuts to the popular charity program already have disastrous consequences.


	“To destroy, to vandalize, it felt like with glee, that these life support systems were being pulled out of the walls,” Bono says, and cited a story in Christianity Today: “[One aide worker said], ‘We don't have the funds, we have to choose which child to pull off the IVs.' It just seems to me, I don't know if ‘evil' is too strong a word, but what we know about pure evil is that it rejoices in the deaths, in the squandering of human life — particularly children. It actually rejoices in it. And whether it's incompetence, whether it's unintended consequences, it's not too late for people.”

	











	Bono added that he has even attempted to address the issue with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who the singer says is “convinced people aren't dying yet.” 


	Rogan pushed back, calling USAID a “money-laundering operation” that has lost even a “trillion” with “no oversight, no receipts.” 


	There has indeed been credible accusations of waste and fraud within the organization (some reading here and here). But such instances are estimated to be a tiny fraction of the organization's $40 billion budget. Nonetheless, the Trump administration put most USAID workers on leave in February amid Musk declaring it a “criminal organization” and that it was “time to die.” 


	That said, Rogan added, “But also, we help the world and when you're talking about making wells for people in the Congo to get fresh water, when you're talking about food and medicine to places that don't have access, no way that should have been cut out. And that should have been clear before they make these radical cuts. There's got to be a way to keep aide and not have fraud.” 


	Rogan added, “The ironic thing is, even though Elon Musk has proposed all these things and the DOGE committee has proposed all these things, they've made no cuts in terms of the budget. They've cut nothing.” 


	Musk posted a clip of Bono and fired back on X: “He's such a liar/idiot. Zero people have died!” 


	Musk and Rubio's insistence that no one has yet died could be referring to the fact the 300,000 deaths report is a prediction of the number of deaths rather than saying those deaths have already occurred. 

	











	In the Christianity Today story that Bono cited, workers on the ground said there have already been cuts to funding and suggested children would begin dying soon. One aide worker said, “I do think we can expect to see increased mortality rates, increased infection, and increased despair if things aren't corrected.” Also, Bono's quote cited about pulling children off IVs was indeed a prediction rather than a current statement of fact. But according to Brooke Nichols — the mathematician and professor of infectious diseases at Boston University who created the prediction model — tens of thousands likely have already died.


	“Because I've been doing HIV [research] for so long, I just assumed that would be where the biggest impact would occur,” Nichols told The Times UK. “But I was really shocked by the child deaths from diarrhea, pneumonia and malnutrition. Tens of thousands of children have died because we've pulled out our funding from diarrhea, pneumonia and food programs.”


	The bottom line seems to be: Humanitarian workers say the Trump administration's actions are already having a dire impact on the ground, but there is some debate over how many deaths, if any, have already occurred. All experts seem to agree the proposed cuts (which reportedly will reduce USAID spending by 80 percent) will be devastating and cause hundreds of thousands of deaths if fully implemented and/or more time passes without the administration changing course.


	Previously, Bill Gates similarly chastised Musk for the cuts to The Financial Times, saying, “The picture of the world's richest man killing the world's poorest children is not a pretty one.” 

	











	The news comes amid Musk stepping down from his official White House role and a New York Times report that claimed the billionaire took copious amounts of ketamine and other drugs during his time running DOGE. Musk has called the report “bs” and said the number of meetings and photographs he was in would make such use impossible.


	During the podcast, Bono further warned against the Trump administration's isolationist impulses in general.


	“I just want to remind Americans of the size of their country, and I'm not talking about the geography,” Bono said. “The size of the idea, it's just an extraordinary thing. It's an idea big enough to fit the whole world, and when it becomes an island rather than a continent … when it shrinks, America seems to stop being America.” 

NEW: Joe Rogan sets the record straight after Bono claimed 300,000 people have died because of DOGE.“[USAID] was a money laundering operation… there's no oversight, no receipts. There is a lot of fraud, a lot of money laundering.”pic.twitter.com/KX2iHjeoHA

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SATURDAY AM: It's a solid weekend following the Memorial Day holiday with all titles driving around $144M worth of business, +117% from the post-holiday doldrums a year ago. Let's rejoice and take it. 


	No, it's not the biggest for the post 4-day holiday during post pandemic times — that belongs to 2023 when Sony's all-pleasing fanboy animated movie, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse led all titles to a $205M+ marketplace. However, out of 22 weekends in 2025, only ten of 'em have grossed north of $100M-plus. Let's be pleased. I'm sure those novelty popcorn buckets at the circuits are still flying off counters. 

	











	Disney's Lilo & Stitch is still on track for a $60M-$64M second weekend, Paramount's Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning is showing that Imax makes a difference in weekend 2 with a -58% hold and $26.7M, and Sony's Karate Kid: Legends…the studio is forecasting $21M-$23M opening off a $7.5M Friday. Rivals see it lower in the high teens, however, as we said yesterday, it boils down to Saturday business and whether that tips more families into both Karate Kid, and Lilo & Stitch toward the higher end of its range. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	There is a bit of overlap between the two films demo wise, even though Lilo skews more female at 62% and Karate Kid: Legends more male at 59%. Their men under 25 demos are close (Legends is 22% to Lilo‘s 18%) and their women over 25 as well (Legends is 30% and Lilo 34%). Yes, of course, substantially more moms are taking kids to see Lilo.

	











	Net production cost on Karate Kid: Legends was $45M before P&A. It will be interesting to see how big overseas is. The franchise was born at a time in 1984 before studios relied on overseas. With Jackie Chan in the 2010 reboot, the foreign box office on that movie edged out domestic, $182.5M to $176.5M and that's without China, however, Japan made a great $17.4M. 


	Men over 25 for Karate Kid were 37% and women under 25 the lowest turnout at 11%. Best grades for the crossover comes from women over 25 with 95%. Diversity demos were 36% Caucasian, 31% Hispanic and Latino, 16% Asian American and 12% Black.


	Great exits though for Karate Kid: Legends with an A- CinemaScore, the same grade as the 1986 sequel, Karate Kid II. The 2010 Chan version landed an A. Of course, the biggest reason on Screen Engine/Comscore's PostTrak why people bought tickets to Legends is because it's part of a franchise they love (46%). Also interesting to note that of all the moviegoers going to see Karate Kid: Legends, 68% of them said they have Netflix as their leading streaming service. That's where Sony's output deal is in the pay-one, and it's also where Cobra Kai lives. 


	A24's Bring Her Back after a $3.1M Friday is looking at $7M-$8M in 5th place. For horror films, especially an A24 one, which typically divides audiences, the movie, wow, landed a B+ CinemaScore. Also, four stars and 80% positive and a 57% definite recommend. High praise. Hopefully that all works in the film's favor throughout this weekend and leg-wise. Thirty one percent of those who bought tickets said they went because it's a Philippou twins movie, and 48% said it's because it's a horror movie.


	Men over 25 mostly turned out at 42%, as well as women over 25 at 28%, with an even amount of men and women under 25 at 15% apiece. Diversity demos were 50% Caucasian, 23% Latino and Hispanic, 14% Black and 9% Asian American. Most influential forms of advertisement for Bring Her Back was social media at 21% per those polled by PostTrak which isn't surprising as it's an A24 movie, and that's where they focus most of their P&A spend. Those polled also said buzz from friends/family was influential (15%) as well as the in-theater trailer (14%). Social media universe across TikTok, Instagram, etc. was 50M per RelishMix, which is ahead of Hereditary (44M) before opening and just under NEON's Cuckoo (53M, $3M opening). 


	Positive word of mouth that RelishMix spotted included fans of the Philippou's Talk to Me, as well as excitement over their trailer, some horror fans remarking that the movie looks like a throwback to 1989's Pet Sematary.

	A24 financed the movie for around $20M I hear, with foreign rights sold going to Sony for around $13M, I understand.  


	Also, as expected, Focus Features' Wes Anderson movie, The Phoenician Scheme, is heading toward the best theater average of 2025 year to date with $95K from six NYC and LA theaters. Not as high as the director's Asteroid City two years ago ($142,2K), but robust enough for the specialty sector post pandemic which is desparate for dollars. 3-day looks like $570K in 12th place. The Angelika in NY led all theaters with $78K yesterday where they had a premium $62 ticket that included an “Immersive Experience” and popcorn. AMC Lincoln Square did $63K, LA's AMC Century City posted $38K, AMC The Grove a similar take, AMC Burbank $31.3K and Alamo Brooklyn was around $23K. Muy bien.

	Notables: 


The Phoenician Scheme (Foc) 6 theaters, Fri $270K, 3-day $570K, PTA $95K, Wk 1 


FRIDAY AFTERNOON: Disney's Lilo & Stitch is coming in right where we were seeing it — at $60M in weekend 2, -59%, at 4,410 locations. That hold is similar to that of the second weekend of Little Mermaid, which was also a Memorial Day theatrical release. Today looks like $17M for Lilo‘s second Friday, -70%. Running total for the Dean Fleischer Camp directed movie by Sunday is $277M. 


	However, Sony's Karate Kid: Legends is looking lighter than forecasts with a $20M opening after a $7M-$8M Friday that includes previews in 3,809 theaters. That would put the Ralph Macchio and Jackie Chan team-up in third place behind Paramount's second weekend of Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning, with a $7.7M second Friday and $27.3M second weekend, -57% at 3,861. That's better than Dead Reckoning‘s second weekend decline of -65% sans Imax screens. Running total for the Christopher McQuarrie directed, Tom Cruise title by Sunday looks like $122.6M. 


	The anticipation is that Saturday will work in both Lilo and Karate Kid: Legends‘ favor.


	Fourth is New Line's Final Destination: Bloodlines with $2.8M today at 3,134 and a third weekend of $10M, -48%, for a running total by Sunday of $110.9M.


	Fifth is A24's Bring Her Back with $3M today (including previews), and $6M-$7M for the weekend at 2,409 sites.   


	Even if Karate Kid: Legends comes in less than expected, we are in far better shape than a year ago when the post Memorial Day weekend only did $66M per Box Office Mojo (there weren't any major studio releases and Garfield Movie led with a second weekend take of $14M). The top five movies this weekend (at the high end) are already grossing north of $124M.


PREVIOUS FRIDAY AM: Sony's Karate Kid: Legends grossed $2.3M from previews that began at 2 p.m. Thursday.


	The PG-13 movie is a vortex of old school and new school: Ralph Macchio's Daniel-san, Jackie Chan's Mr. Han and, shhhhh, the Cobra Kai gang (I mean, is it really a secret?). Forecast for the movie is $25M-$30M in a marketplace where Disney's Lilo & Stitch is overpowering with a potential $60M second frame. Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning also is hoping to hold with those Imax screens, around $32M or less.

	











	Critics like this Karate Kid a little less than the 2010 Chan one, 55% Rotten vs. 67% fresh. Karate Kid: Legends received 4 stars on PostTrak and a 68% definite recommend from definite audiences, 4 1/2 stars from parents and a 63 definite recommend, and kids under 12 with 4½ stars and a 79% must-see right away. Boys ages 10-12 at 64% made up the majority of the under-12 set; that demo is an essential portion of the Cobra Kai cult. Overall, men showed up at 60% last night.


Karate Kid: Legends‘ Thursday night is just ahead of the $1.9M that Sony/Alcon's The Garfield Movie reboot made last May before a Friday of $8.4M and 3-day of $24M.


Karate Kid: Legends was made for $45M net before P&A; that's $5M more than the 2010 version cost (unadjusted for inflation). The Karate Kid franchise is 41 years old and counts $620M at the global box office from five previous movies; the bulk of that figure is from the Chan/Jaden Smith version 15 years ago, which made $359M worldwide.


	A24's Danny and Michael Philippou horror movie Bring Her Back made $850K in previews at 2,409 theaters that began at 4 p.m. Thursday. That figure is just under A24's fall sleeper Heretic, which made $1.2M in previews starting at 7 p.m. before turning into a $4.3M Friday and $10.8M opening. The Philippou twins' previous A24 movie, 2022's Talk to Me, opened to $10.4M. A good definite-recommend from the fanboy crowd last night for Bring Her Back at 58%, with women over 25 giving the movie its best positive score at 83%. The Thursday crowd was male-heavy at 57% to female's 43%. Women overall enjoyed it more than the guys, 83% to 77%. Go Sally Hawkins. The pre-weekend outlook is $5M-$7M. On Rotten Tomatoes, Bring Her Back has been stamped with 88% certified fresh. No audience score yet.


Lilo & Stitch ends its first week with $217M at 4,410 theaters, after $9.2M yesterday, -9% from Wednesday. The pic's first week is 15% behind that the $255M for  Inside Out 2, which ended its run at $652.9M, and it's 9% behind Moana 2‘s first seven days of $239.3M (final $460.4M). No, we're not saying the movie is doing badly, we're just trying to give you an idea of where Lilo & Stitch lives. While no one is forecasting this for Lilo & Stitch, sometimes these fan-fave Disney movies can go into overdrive, i.e. Inside Out 2 owns the best second weekend ever for a PG movie of $101.2M. And nobody saw that coming…


Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning ends its first week with an estimated $95.3M at 3,857, which is 7% ahead of the first week of 2018's Mission: Impossible – Fallout ($220.1M final domestic) and 4.7% ahead of the first seven days of 2022's Dead Reckoning (final domestic B.O. was $172.6M).


	The rest of the top 5 for the week:


	3. Final Destination Bloodlines (WB/NL) 3,523 theaters, Thu $1.85M (-13% from Wed), Week $30.7M (-56%), Total $100.9M/Wk 2It was the highest grossing of the franchise out of the gate. Nothing in its way.


	4. Thunderbolts* (Dis) 3,180 theaters, Thu $765K (-10%), Wk $14.8M (-36%), Total $177M/Wk 4


	5. Sinners (WB) 2,632 theaters, Thu $880k (-15%), Wk $14.06M (-37%), Total $261.8M/Wk 6

	It's official: After a six-year saga, Taylor Swift finally owns her music. She took control following a tense situation that started in 2019, when her contract with Big Machine ended and her masters were sold to Scooter Braun and Ithaca Holdings. Today, after re-recording four out of six of the albums she had released under Big Machine, Swift announced in a letter that she now had control over all her old music — and her fans are just as elated as she is.


	Zainub Amir, who manages the update account @SwiftNYC, is still “speechless,” she says. “I am still trying to find the words. Taylor has poured so much into her music and seeing her finally own it all felt incredibly emotional. It's such a testament to her persistence and a huge inspiration to anyone who's ever felt unheard or undervalued.”


	Longtime fan Kyra Beck initially thought the letter was fake as it began circulating on social media. “I try to approach everything on the Internet with a healthy dose of skepticism,” she admits. “Once I realized it wasn't, I ran to her website to read the letter. I've been a fan since around the Red era, so I've lived through the entire masters situation, and her honesty throughout this journey has been so inspiring to see. I just feel so overwhelmed with happiness and pride for her.”

	“These albums have such a special place in all our hearts,” says another fan named Rachel Rogerson. “To have them back in the hands of the person who created them means the absolute world. If I'm honest, I couldn't stop crying at the thought of her owning these albums, as I watched and supported her through all the turmoil and pain that this caused.”

	











	The point of Swift's re-recording project, in her own words, was to devalue the original albums while they were under other people's ownership. For much of the fandom, this became a kind of political stance: Numerous fans avoided listening to the original recordings, in a show of solidarity with Swift. Today, many celebrated online by listening to the original versions of classic Swift songs like “Style” and “Holy Ground.”

	“Personally, I did not listen to the ‘stolen' versions after Taylor's Versions were released,” Rogerson says. “Knowing the money received would be going to a person who has taken advantage of someone that I deeply love was a dealbreaker for me, and it brings me immense joy that [Scooter Braun] will no longer be benefiting from both the sales and streams of these albums.”


	After Swift's Eras Tour wrapped in 2024, the star went dark after the Grammys and Super Bowl. Swifties waited impatiently for her next move, assuming that re-recorded versions of Reputation and her self-titled debut album (known as “debut” colloquially in the fandom) would be released soon. In the letter, Swift admitted she barely made a dent in re-recording Reputation, finding it difficult to recreate the magic of that album again. For some fans, it's a little sad to see the end of the re-recording project, especially given the numerous, never-before-released “vault” recordings she'd tack on to each Taylor's Version.


	“It's so bittersweet,” says fan Savannah Charles. “Reputation is definitely a fan favorite that so many Swifties were eagerly anticipating, but at the same time, I think Taylor hit the nail on the head — it's a fan favorite because she perfected that era.”


	Overall, the fandom feels uniquely bonded by the experience. Like Swift's music, the ordeal made her stans feel like they were on this journey with her, fighting for her music as much as she was. For many, the experience was the reason why Eras Tour existed in the first place, so there were some positives they've observed as they reflect on the situation now that it's over.

	“As awful as the original situation was, I do think it was the catalyst for so many incredible things, like the Eras Tour,” Beck says. “I got to interact with tons of other Swifties while creating my Eras Tour surprise song blanket, and it was incredible to see how united everyone was in their support for Taylor's fight to own her work. I've even heard of newer fans saying they were waiting for the re-recordings to listen to Reputation and her debut for the first time, so I hope they're having fun listening today!”

brb on my way to listen to Taylor's first six albums (ethical version) 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹

I love when Taylor Swift pretends like she's unsure if we want her to release music she's recorded when she knows her fans are feral and would literally make an album of her farts chart.

It was all worth it for this https://t.co/KNsJpPDtzJ

the concept of her using the money from the eras tour to buy her old masters is the most poetic shit i've ever seen tayjesus. pic.twitter.com/L75mep7HW7

there will be no reputation, there will just be explanation pic.twitter.com/EFtgBFs1Dz

not religious or anything but I think this is how religious people felt when Jesus returned

I know you're new here if you're like “omg I don't know how I can go back to the originals” because I feel like I just won a custody battle

the eras tour would be the perfect place to celebrate this

the taylor's versions AND the originals are both so beloved to me, idc idc my heart is big enough for all of taylor's music

It's so bizarre that this info didn't get leaked, Taygod is so powerful

	The tech-bro rich, they are not like you and me. They treat the world like it's their frat house. They view atrocities not as losses of human life but as “atrocitopportunities.” They get high on the fumes of their own disruption. They buy private planes, private security armies, private compounds in the Snowy Hills of Utah, and Argentina — as in, the entire country of Argentina — on a whim. They think nothing of killing one of their own, should a formerly-down-for-anything bro not view the complete and utter breakdown of modern society as a chance to remake Earth 2.0 in their own exfoliated, highly toned image. They refuse to fiddle while Rome burns, but hey, they know a ton of venture capitalists who'd fund an app that'd allow you to soundtrack 21st century Ragnarok via the dubstep deep cuts of your choice.


	Imagine a feature-length episode of Succession that treated the final season's villain, GoJo CEO Lukas Matsson, as its main character and then multiplied him by four, and you'd have something like Mountainhead, Jesse Armstrong‘s caustic, corrosive satire of Silicon Valley mega-royalty run amuck. (It's on Max now and premieres on HBO proper tonight.) The British showrunner of that blisteringly cynical drama spent five years and 39 episodes giving us a portrait of filthy rich people pulling strings and behaving badly. You think the elite of the elite are broken, petty, and sociopathic, the show continually and rhetorically asked. You have no idea. He now focuses all that bile and ire on the Musks, the Thiels, the Bezoses and the Zuckerbergs who feel they're contemporary Caesars, and wonders aloud: What's to stop them from taking everything over?

	











	But first, there will be dick-measuring contests. Or rather, net-worth-in-billions-measuring contests, which is the One-percenter contingent's version of slapping phalluses next to rulers on tabletops. Among the Brewsters, i.e. the quartet of CEO alphas that have gathered together for what's supposed to be a super-chill poker weekend, the current champ would be Venis (Cory Michael Smith), whose Facebook-like platform Traam has just launched some major additions to their in-house content-creation suite. In second place is Jeff (Ramy Youssef), an AI guru getting a lot of love from the public sector about an anti-deepfake filter his company has concocted. The bronze medal goes to Randall (Steve Carell), the group's elder statesman and self-admitted oracle of Hegelian wisdom. Rounding out the group is Hugo (Jason Schwartzman), also known as Superman. Or rather, that's “Soup-erman,” derived from his original nickname “Soup Kitchen”; this runt of the litter still spells billionaire with a capital M.

	Hugo is hosting his longtime buds at his new place outside of Park City — serious props to the production design team for making this real-life getaway somehow seem even uglier and more bunker-like — in the hopes of changing his pole position. He's got a meditation app that will transform the mental health space, especially since that sector is blowing up due to global instability. Who better to hit up for funding then his Brewski besties? 


	He's not the only one with an agenda, however. That content-creation app on Traam is stoking serious sectarian violence everywhere from Kansas to Kazakhstan, and Venis needs Jeff to sell him his AI to soothe his board. Jeff, having apparently downloaded something resembling a conscience, wants nothing to to do with his old pal's “4Chan on fucking acid” shitshow. He's still pissed about some podcast comments Venis made and is happy to see him twist in the wind; plus the catastrophes are doing wonders for his stock. And Randall? He's dying of cancer, and angry that these so-called doctors he's hired to cure him say they can't. But if he can get Venis to fast-track his vision of downloading consciousness online, immortality is just one upgrade away. 


	The more these guys trash-talk each other, suck up to each other, hug it out, slug it out, undermine and over-inflate their respective achievements, the more that Mountainhead sketches a picture of these Master of the Universe in a manner that occasionally draws blood. There are enough quotable lines of dialogue in the movie's first half to remind you why Succession was, pound for pound, one of the most profanely funny shows on TV during its run. Once the decision to attack one of their own dominates the second half, you can feel the zingers lose their sting and the story starting to sag. But as with Armstrong's five-season History of the Decline and Fall of the Roy-man Empire, there's a real attention paid all the way through regarding the way that the powerful speak. And more importantly, how they use language to mask, justify, salve and dismiss their self-serving rottenness. Words matter, but only when they help these men underwrite, say, releasing tools that allow for the ability to distinguish fact from fiction. Or to let them sleep at night while whole populations kill each other. Or to allow them to murder someone yet retain the moral high ground, because, y'know, Nietzche.

	“Do you believe in other people?” Venis asks, in a rare moment of sincerity, to Randall. “I think one has to?” his mentor replies, and given the way that Carell spins the sentence tells you how performative such notions as faith in humanity is for these guys. (All four of the stars eat heartily here, though we might give the edge to Smith, who gives Venis the same level of smarmy, superiority-complex-driven douchebaggery that he gave Chevy Chase in Saturday Night.) Which is why the band of bros' decision that they should literally take over the world feels like a logical next step. Who or what is stop them? 

	











	No, really, we're asking, and so is Armstrong: How could we keep these delusional ratfuckers from what they believe is their destiny of total dominion over humanity? They already control the hardware, the software, the artificial intelligence that has supplanted actual intelligence, the ability to separate fact from self-destructive LOLZ fiction. The only thing in their way is their own ADHD and dysfunctional group dynamic. Mountainhead takes its name from Hugo's snowy retreat, which eventually doubles as a sort of Eagle's Nest for their would-be New World Order; the moniker's resemblance to The Fountainhead, designed by “Ayn Bland,” is duly noted. But we'd suggest an alternative title for what often feels like a documentary of our apocalypse, now: 4 Tech Bros, 1 Coup. This what happens when “move fast and break shit” becomes the ruling class's gospel. What you end up with is a world broken faster than a speeding click.

	It's Elon Musk's last day as an official employee of the federal government, “but not really, because he will, always, be with us, helping all the way” — at least according to President Donald Trump's announcement of his parting press conference with the billionaire. 


	In an Oval Office presser that mirrored many of the duo's televised White House appearances, the president thanked Musk for his time leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and for “willingly” accepting “outrageous abuse and slander and lies and attacks, because he does love our country.” 


	Trump reiterated that “Elon is really not leaving” and that he is “going to be back-and-forth” to tend to his “baby,” DOGE, and that “he's going to be doing a lot of things.”


	Trump presented Musk with a ceremonial White House key for his efforts, and added that under DOGE's guidance “the mind-set of the senior ranks at every federal department has really changed.” 

	











	Musk stated that, in his view, the work of DOGE was just beginning, and that despite his  departure he expected “to continue to provide advice on whatever the president would like advice on.” 


	“I will continue to be visiting here and be a friend and advisor to the president, and we look forward to being back in this amazing room,” Musk said at one point. 


	The press conference came hours after The New York Times released a report detailing Musk's allegedly regular use of ketamine and other recreational drugs while campaigning on behalf of Trump in 2024. According to sources who spoke to the Times, Musk had privately complained that his regular consumption of ketamine was causing him issues with his bladder, a common side effect of chronic use. Musk also reportedly took ecstasy and mushrooms while stumping for Trump last year.

	











	When Fox News' Peter Doocy attempted to ask about the report, Musk interrupted him before he could finish the question.

	“New York Times, is that the same publication that got a Pulitzer Prize for false reporting on Russiagate? Is that the same organization? I think it is?” Musk asked in a bizarre, seemingly rehearsed bit. “Let's move on,” he said to Doocey, who — in typical Fox News fashion — heeded the instruction and abandoned the line of questioning.


	The bizarre nature of the press conference was highlighted by Musk having a black eye, which he claimed was due to his five-year-old son punching him in the face. “I was just walking around with little X, and I said, ‘Go ahead, punch me in the face,' and he did,” Musk said.


	The gone-but-not-forgotten sentiment around Musk's departure was reaffirmed by the White House and other prominent GOP lawmakers. 


	White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday that members of the president's Cabinet will continue “to work with the respective DOGE employees who have onboarded as political appointees at all of these agencies,” and that “the mission of DOGE will continue, and many DOGE employees are now political appointees of our government.” 


	In a post on X, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) wrote that although Musk is stepping away from his government role, “the House is eager and ready to act on DOGE's findings so we can deliver even more cuts to big government that President Trump wants and the American people demand.”

	DOGE's chaotic cuts have been cruel, nonsensical, and widely informed by misinformation about waste and fraud. The agency gutted government services that benefit the less fortunate, including all but eliminating the United States Agency for International Development. Some have estimated that the cuts have already resulted in 300,000 deaths, with over two-thirds of those being children.


	Trump continued to lavish praise on Musk's work during the press conference on Friday. “Elon's service to America has been without comparison in modern history,” he said.

F
orty-one years ago, Ralph Macchio landed the role of a bullied high school student who learns karate from his apartment building's handyman in The Karate Kid. Few people involved with the movie thought they were creating a mega-blockbuster, but it wound up grossing an astounding $130.8 million on a mere $8 million budget. It was followed by two sequels starring Macchio, and a fourth film where Hilary Swank became The Next Karate Kid.


	In 2018, Karate Kid superfans Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg convinced Macchio to put the gi back on for the Netflix series Cobra Kai, which moved the story into the next generation, while still chronicling the lives of the surviving characters from the original films. Once again, the project wildly surpassed expectations, running for six seasons and racking up near-record audience numbers on the streamer.


Cobra Kai has been off the air for only a matter of months, but this week, Macchio returned as Daniel LaRusso once again: In the new theatrical movie Karate Kid: Legends, he's paired with Jackie Chan's Mr. Han character from the 2010 Karate Kid remake.

	











	It could easily frustrate an actor to be so closely associated with a single character, particularly one they've been playing for decades, but Macchio, 63, has come to terms with it. “I don't want to call it a double-edged sword, but it's made things challenging, certainly,” he tells Rolling Stone via Zoom from his home in California. “No matter how many times you want to shout out My Cousin Vinny or The Outsiders, it's Karate Kid that people bring up.” Still he adds, “It sounds lame, but that character and the franchise brings joy to kids from six to 86. In this world, if that's my footprint, it could be worse.”

	











	For Rolling Stone‘s Last Word column, Macchio talked about the pitfalls of child stardom, managing the slow times in his career, the prospects of a Cobra Kai movie, and more.


What are the best and worst parts of success?The best part is getting a chance to pay a little bit of it forward. I enjoy sharing with the next generation a piece of the gift that I was given, because I got pretty lucky. When talking with the young actors on Cobra Kai, along with my kids and their friends, they kind of lean in and they want to hear these stories. They're usually positive stories, and I feel like I'm passing on some positivity in a world that honestly is not always so positive.

	The worst part is that you're under a microscope anywhere you go. You have to stay home to have the “off” switch. Also, when you lose success, you put so much pressure on yourself to have it again. And that's probably the worst part, the amount of pressure you put on yourself.


What music moves you the most?I'm on this Roy Orbison tear right now, just his voice, that music, those songs… I have just gone down that rabbit hole of his music. And Springsteen never gets old for me.


Do you have a favorite Springsteen song?I'm not really original here since everyone love this song, but “Thunder Road.” It's very cinematic. And I also love “Long Walk Home” right now. His music just speaks to you at different stages of your life. And obviously, I'm into Coldplay now since I got to do that music video with them. That was a really cool moment.


You've been with your wife for nearly 40 years. That's about 400 years in Hollywood time. What's the secret to a long marriage?For me, our relationship always felt right and instinctively magical from the get-go. That's because she was way out of my league. I was punching way up a couple of weight classes. And then for a long-term relationship, you need to have a foundation that's always there. It's about working together for what you believe is meant to be. And there are plenty of times where it doesn't feel all right, and that's part of the journey. The work and the sensibilities of myself and Phyllis, my wife, are… I don't want to use the term stick-to-itiveness because that is kind of a chintzy word, but you have to sometimes tuck that football in and keep your eye on the prize, even through the turbulent times, because you know the prize is great.

You've always looked at least 10 years younger than you actually are. How much of that is living well and how much of that is genetic?It's mainly genes, but I am healthy and I do live well. I don't smoke. I'm not a drug user, besides alcohol when I want to have a drink or some wine. I'm a big fan of great wine. So, it's my parents' fault. I blame them. They screwed it up. They made this happen. But it's getting tough. I like being a little bit further away from the camera these days. When they send in pictures and they say, “This is the shot we'd like to use. We'll clean up Ralph's neck. We'll take those lines out in that droopy part” — that's all new now. That's happening more, but I guess we call it the Macchio curve. I get to wait a little bit longer before that stuff happens. 

	











What's the most indulgent purchase you've ever made?Right after The Outsiders, before The Karate Kid, I had just enough to buy the biggest Mercedes that there was. It was like the 560 SEL 1983 or whatever this was. It was a big black Mercedes. I mean, it must've looked like a little kid driving his father's Cadillac. I don't know why. I just wanted that. It was like your rich uncle's car. At the time, it was $55,000.


You avoided this curse, but why do you think so many child stars turned to drugs when they got older?There's a void when fame disappears, when you have it and you lose it. When you wave to that guard on the movie lot and he just says, “Hi,” and then you come back two years later, and they ask to see your license and make you wait. That plays on certain people, especially when you're young.


	But this is not to say that I didn't have times where I might not have been the most pleasant guy to be around, even for my wife and my family, because I was a little rudderless. I was like, “What am I going to do?” 


You didn't work a ton in the Nineties and early 2000s. What filled your time?Some of that was starting my family. My daughter was born '92, my son was born '95. So, I was kind of around for all that, for the most part. I would pop out to L.A. or New York, do some theater, do a few guest spots in television shows or whatever, indie movie here or there.


	There were times I was frustrated with my career. When I look at it now, it's like I designed it perfectly. I got to be there [with my kids]. I had the big rush at the beginning. I got to be a dad and not be an absent person, and a husband, for that matter. And now to watch them witness all this, what's going on now with Cobra Kai, and see them champion me and cheer it on, it's an embarrassment of riches in a way.


What's your best advice to an actor in the middle of a dry spell?Stay creative. You can always be creative, if that's part of what's missing. If the fame part and being successful is what's missing, then maybe you're in the wrong deal, because none of that's in your control. Your creativity is in some of your control, because you could venture out and try and take risks. Whether you can make a living at it or not is a whole other story, and that's really the challenge.


You did Dancing With the Stars. Did that lead to offers for more reality shows you turned down?Yes. And I passed on Dancing With the Stars numerous times before that. It was just the right time to do it, and it turned out well for me. But yes, then you become in that pool of, I'm a Celebrity, Kick Me Off a Running Train, or Fear Factor: Celebrity Africa or whatever. So, I've got plenty of those Masked Singer offers. I understand the success of that show. It's just not of interest to me right now.

	











	But the one thing Dancing With the Stars does, and I think it gives the credit to that show, is it's not train-wreck TV. They really want people to do well. You look at The Karate Kid, it's the underdog story, and that's what kind of worked for me. I was sort of a parallel of that guy. I had the fans kind of embracing the older version of this kid.


What's the biggest difference between Eighties fame and 2020s fame?There was a lot more drugs in your face then. I was too afraid to get near it, but it was all over the place. I was around it all the time. You also had a little bit of time if something went wrong back then. Now, you have no time. Something goes wrong, it's out there. It's just in your feed, people are taunting you. It's super-challenging. I don't know how these young actors and young famous people deal with it. But on the flip side to that, they also can make themselves famous from it without having done anything, really.


Cobra Kai was basically the biggest show on Netflix for years. How were you processing that after all these years out of the limelight?Sometimes I use the word “stupid.” This is just stupid how successful this is, but that's really underselling it. I think a lot of credit goes to the original filmmakers back in '84 and the writer, Robert Mark Kamen, who created the story and these characters and that Mr. Miyagi, human Yoda, that was that kind of secret sauce of the whole franchise. And then Jon, Josh, and Hayden who write this show and care so much. They flipped the script on characters and brought in new ones coming from different angles. 


	I remember an executive said, “Congratulations on Cobra Kai. Everything old is new again.” And I responded, “You know what? It's always been there. It's always been the new nostalgia, in a way.” But it is blessed from somewhere above, because it really has had such a warm embrace from what is now close to four generations that were waiting for the big finale, which really lands.


Is any part of this a little bittersweet since Pat Morita isn't here to see it?A little bit, but I feel confident in saying I've done him and our partnership well. I feel strongly about that in the show, and hopefully what we'll see with the Karate Kid: Legends movie coming. I'm always wanting to protect the honesty of that partnership, which to me is the magic of The Karate Kid. Without Miyagi, there is no… We're not doing any of this.


A lot of fans were expecting to see Hilary Swank revive her character from The Next Karate Kid in the last season. Did they try to get her on?Yeah, they tried to. There's nothing Jon, Josh, and Hayden did not try to check every box, and they checked almost every single box. I think they connected with her, but I think she just didn't want to do it for whatever the reason. It just didn't make sense for whatever was going on in her life at that time. And I wasn't deep into any of those conversations, I just knew they took a stab at getting her on. They had one version of the story with her, and another version without her.

	











I presume she would have resolved the story about Miyagi and the stolen necklace.Yeah. That was the intention.


I really loved the Cobra Kai finale. The scene that struck me the most was the final confrontation between Johnny and Kreese in the parking lot. Billy [Zabka, who plays Johnny] deserves an Emmy for that.Yeah, he really went for it. It was shot two days after my scene [with the CGI Pat Morita]. I said, “Hi, did my ‘Cobra Cry' scene, how was yours?” He goes, “I think I nailed it.” He felt really good about it. And it's great because you're following his character the whole way, and he does a terrific job in the show.


Wrapping up the storylines of so many characters must have been tough.That's part of the challenge. And it was nice for them to have the 15 episodes to be able to do that. The most emotional scene to me is with Daniel and Samantha, the goodbye scene where she's heading off to Okinawa. The Daniel and Samantha relationship from the first episode of the show has been at the heart of depth for my character and her. So, that was really moving to me.


Do you think the original Karate Kid would get a green light by a Hollywood studio today?It probably would've been on the Family Channel or a faith-based network. It could maybe have been a Little Miss Sunshine-like Fox Searchlight movie. You'd like to believe it can cut through, because the story worked so well. But on paper, it's another time, man, it's really hard.


When you first heard about Karate Kid: Legends, did you feel any hesitancy about going back to the character yet again?Yeah. But even with Cobra Kai, I knew it was time to jump in the water, I just didn't know the temperature of the pool. With Karate Kid: Legends, it was exciting to look at, “Wow, I started this on the big screen. Can I end it on the big screen?”


	Connecting the worlds was the challenge. They figured out a way to do that that is organic to a scene in The Karate Kid Part II, that people on the internet are starting to figure out, which connects that karate comes from kung fu, which is the truth. My thing was trying to uphold the integrity of Miyagi and Daniel and the mythology of the original movie.


	And so it required a little bit of back and forth work, and working with Jackie Chan. The movie picks up years after Cobra Kai. There's a different version of Daniel that is more at peace in his life and more Miyagi, in a way.


Did you know Jackie Chan prior to this?I did not. But I did meet him at the premiere of the 2010 [Karate Kid] remake. But that always just felt like another island. Now it feels like part of the ecosystem in the grand universe. I feel very Luke Skywalker. I could be on The Mandalorian, and I could be in a Star Wars movie.

	











What was it like working with Ben Wang, the young star of Legends? It must have been cool to watch someone start a journey that you started 40 years ago.Exactly. He's terrific. He's also a dedicated young martial artist. He speaks fluent Mandarin. He checked so many of the boxes, and he has a very winning personality, which is super-important. And if you've seen the trailer, you can tell that it feels cinematic. It doesn't feel like the original Karate Kid movie, the Eighties, and it doesn't feel like Cobra Kai, either. And I like that, because it says that we could exist in this place.


Do you think this is your last time playing Daniel?Might I do my Gran Torino version? Listen, I hope the movie does well. I want it to be the next stage of other chapters, and I'd love there to be a Cobra Kai movie in two years from now as well. I mean, why not keep the party going as long as it can be rooted in some form of genuine truth? Listen, if you came to me in 1995 and said, “You're going to play Daniel LaRusso again.” I would say, “It's never going to happen.” So, never say never. Never say never.


You don't see Kreese or Terry Silver actually die when the boat blows up in the Cobra Kai finale. Maybe at least one of them lives…I know. It's not my single favorite moment in the story. And the fact that nobody mentions anything about it… Listen, what can you say? They wanted to do that.


What do you hope to accomplish in the next few years?I'd like to do a little more directing. I directed Episode Three of this season of Cobra Kai. I really loved that. I love working with the actors. I love taking a piece of what I've learned from the Coppolas and the Avildsens. I remember them setting shots or discussing something, and just taking that and implementing it myself. That's something that I have a lot more room to grow with.

	I don't need to be the lead. I'd love to fit in some sort of family that maybe is not about “every argument needs to be solved with a karate bloodbath.”

	British actor and comedian Ricky Gervais celebrated Friday, receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.


BBC News reports that Gervais said he was “humbled” to have his star in a place that “celebrates the dreamers and doers of the industry,” and that his success was a mix of “luck, persistence, and a little bit of pushing against the tide.”


	Gervais said he was initially nervous about receiving the accolade, believing he'd have to get down on all fours and put his hands in concrete: “I thought, I won't get back up and that will be embarrassing. But I don't have to do that. Me standing her now is as embarrassing and awkward as it gets.”

	











	The Walk of Fame producer Ana Martinez said: “Finally, a star that will give snarky commentary every time someone walks by… I always knew we needed a comedian's touch on our famed sidewalk.”

	Gervais has enjoyed huge success both in the UK and the US. His original BBC comedy The Office which he co-wrote and starred in was adapted into a long running US version starring Steve Carell, and he also created the Netflix hit comedy drama After Life.


	He is equally well-known for his string of stand-up comedy specials, and for his ruthless barbs at A-list guests while hosting the Golden Globe Awards on five occasions.

	Ruby Ibarra, a Filipina-American rapper from the Bay Area known for her potent storytelling, made her debut on NPR's Tiny Desk this week.


	Chosen among 7,500 entries from independent artists across the country, Ibarra secured the top spot for the series' annual contest with her entry track, “Bakunawa,” which released last fall. With her hair slicked back into a ponytail and wearing an “I Love Pinays” tee for the moment, Ibarra performed alongside her all-Filipino band and together, they delivered a heavy-hitting trio of tracks buoyed by shimmering instrumentals.


	It was a moment Ibarra seized. “Being human is not illegal. Immigrants have been here, lived here, worked here,” she said before introducing herself: “And this immigrant is here. From Tacloban City, Philippines, all the way to Washington, D.C., my name is Ruby Ibarra.”


	When speaking to Rolling Stone over the phone, Ibarra, who was born on the Leyte island, recalls her early influences. “A lot of the early memories that I have kept from spending the first few years in the Philippines involved a lot of music,” says the artist. “At a young age, a lot of my cousins, uncles were all part of bands, and they perform at local festivals. So, music was always in and outside of my household.” 

	











	After moving to San Lorenzo in San Francisco's East Bay, Ibarra says she was later influenced by hip-hop's Golden Age, from the likes of Tupac, the Fugees, and Wu-Tang Clan. Throughout her music, Ibarra weaves in elements of storytelling embracing the rhythms and narratives of the genre, while also bringing her relentless blend of Tagalog and English to her lyrics.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	When discussing her choice of tracks for her NPR appearance, along with “Bakunawa,” Ibarra also featured “Someday” (what she says is a “reminder” to herself that some of the best things in life happen in due time) and “7000 Miles,” a song she says felt important to include “because of the state that we're in right now in this country.”


	“There's a lot of questions about who belongs here, and for me, I've always been such a strong advocate, as an immigrant myself, of making sure that people feel seen, people feel visible, people feel like they're welcome,” she says. “It was a perfect opportunity to create conversation around that and at the same time, to also celebrate my experiences as a Filipina immigrant.”

	The single, from her 2017 album Circa 91, portrays her mother's journey from the U.S. to the Philippines and Ibarra's own evolving frame of mind while watching her mother struggle and fight for a better life for their family. The rapper says that during her Tiny Desk performance, her mother was in the audience. “Where the chorus goes, ‘Mama will make it in America,' it was so special,” says Ibarra. While the camera didn't capture the crowd that included a small group of family and friends, Ibarra says that when she would look over, “they were crying, they were passing around a box of tissue, and I was starting to get soaked up myself just seeing my mom's reaction, and it was just special.”


	She says the moment was an important experience for her and her band, as well as a “collective win.” The ensemble included June Millington of Fanny, Ouida, and Charito Soriano on vocals; Jojo Ramirez on drums; Camille Ramirez on flute and bass; Angelo “Lasi” Macaraeg on acoustic guitar and keyboard; and Anna Macan on electric guitar.


	She adds, “We do hope to see more Filipino American artists on that stage, in that space, there's so much great talent out there, and we're hoping that we can keep that door open.”

	When looking ahead, Ibarra has her efforts focused on her sophomore album that will be released through her Bolo Music Group, which she founded with producer Lasi in 2023.


	“I want to make sure that the music that I share always has as a message, has a point. I'm not the type of rapper to ever waste even just the word. Every word is in the song for a reason,” she says. Ibarra says that her music, like her, will continued to evolve, and that the experience of motherhood has made her “revisit a lot of the lyrics that I have.” Passing on the stories of those before her, Ibarra says “I want to continue becoming a songwriter so that the songs I release can help create dialog with my daughter someday.”

	The Diddy trial is still unfolding, but Bill Maher believes it has already shown that a “new rule” should be imposed for sexual assault cases nearly eight years after the start of the #MeToo movement. 


	In his end-of-show monologue on Real Time Friday (watch it above), Maher used the prosecution of Sean “Diddy” Combs as a prism for how sexual misconduct is viewed in society and in the justice system. “A lot has changed” since the initial wave of allegations against Harvey Weinstein and many others in 2017, he maintained.


	“We need to keep two thoughts in our head at the same time: One, Diddy is a bad dude – really bad. Like, the worst thing in rap since Hammer pants. A violent, sick f–k – I'm sorry, an alleged violent, sick f–k. And we should lock him up and throw away the baby oil,” Maher said. “And two, things have changed enough that moving forward, the rule should be, if you're being abused, you've got to leave right away.”

	The host pointed out what he sees as inconsistencies in the testimony of Cassie Ventura, Diddy's former girlfriend.

	“It's not victim-shaming to expect women to have the agency to leave toxic relationships. Quite the contrary, to not expect that is infantilizing,” Maher said. “If Diddy walks free, it will because his lawyers can point to an endless stream of texts from Cassie expressing what's often called ‘enthusiastic consent' to their sex life. If you're ‘MeToo-ing' someone, it's not helpful to your case if you texted him, ‘me too!'”


	A graphic on the screen next to Maher displayed text messages from Ventura to Combs presented at trial, including one that read, “I'm always ready to freak off.”


	Years ago, “when women felt, for good reason, that ‘OG predators' like Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein would never be held accountable, why not at least get something out of it?” Maher said. Most of the initially accused perpetrators were surrounded by “all sorts of enablers” (assistants, cops, agents, “cowards” afraid to defy the person signing their paycheck), Maher recalled. In that era, “it was not illogical for an abused woman to say, ‘Well, if I can't get justice for my pain, can I at least get a receipt? A coupon?'”

	











	Maher did acknowledge, “as counter-intuitive as it seems, why an abused woman would send complimentary text.” Unlike in past eras, though, he argued, “We're not in the ‘no one listens to women or takes them seriously' era anymore. Operators are actually standing by to take your calls.”


	Statistics show more women have reported claims of abuse and mistreatment over the past seven-plus years, Maher pointed out.


	“I understand why it can be difficult for women to leave an abusive relationship,” he said. “But this should be society's new grand bargain. We take every allegation seriously, but don't tell me anymore about your contemporaneous account that you said to two friends 10 years ago. Tell the police right away. Don't wait a decade. Don't journal about it. Don't turn it into a one-woman show. And most importantly, don't keep f–king him. Your only contemporaneous notes about what he did should be a police report.”


	The show-business sparkle of the music business also can't be eliminated from the Diddy situation or others that have played out in Hollywood, Maher continued. “If we're going to have an honest conversation about abuse, we also have to have an honest conversation about what people are willing to do for stardom. If you want a No. 1 record so bad you'll take a No. 1 in the face, some of that is on you,” he said. “And if you're doing it for love, well, c'mon, Oprah and Dr. Phil and every podcaster in the world by now have done a million shows about ‘abuse is not love' and ‘abusers don't change.'”


	R&B singer Ike Turner “was a psycho, just like Diddy,” Maher said. “But in an era when there was no movement to help her, Tina Turner somehow got away and she did it with 36 cents in her pocket and a mobile card.”

Según Nationals Park, "la producción completa de la gira de Shakira no puede ser transportada a Washington, D.C. a tiempo".


													Por												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	El concierto de Shakira programado como parte del evento de bienvenida al WorldPride en Washington, D.C. se suspendió el viernes (30 de mayo), un día después de que se cancelara su show en Fenway Park en Boston.


	La noticia se compartió en las redes sociales de Nationals Park, el estadio de los Washington Nationals de las Grandes Ligas.


	“Por las complicaciones del show anterior en Boston, la producción completa de la gira de Shakira no puede ser transportada a Washington, D.C. a tiempo para su presentación programada en Nationals Park el sábado 31 de mayo”, dice el comunicado del estadio. “Como resultado, el show en D.C. ha sido cancelado. A pesar de todos los esfuerzos por hacerlo posible, no se puede seguir adelante según lo planeado”.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	El comunicado indica que los reembolsos serán “emitidos automáticamente para las compras realizadas a través de Ticketmaster y Nationals.com”, mientras que quienes compraron boletos a través de revendedores terceros deberán contactar directamente al punto de compra.

	











	En una declaración inicial compartida en las redes de Nationals Park, Shakira expresó su tristeza por la cancelación: “Debido a circunstancias fuera de mi control, estoy triste y con el corazón roto por no poder estar en Washington, D.C. con ustedes mañana. Espero poder regresar a D.C. tan pronto como me sea posible. Mientras tanto, sepan que estoy eternamente agradecida por su apoyo incondicional”. Sin embargo, esta declaración ha sido eliminada de las cuentas de Nationals Park y no aparece en los canales oficiales de la artista.


	El show de Shakira programado para la noche del jueves en el Fenway Park de Boston fue cancelado solo unas horas antes de su inicio “debido a circunstancias imprevistas”, según anunció el estadio en sus redes sociales. Más tarde, Live Nation dijo a Billboard en un comunicado: “Durante una revisión de rutina previa al show, se identificaron elementos estructurales que no cumplían con los estándares, por lo que los shows fueron cancelados. Todo el equipo está a salvo”.


	A pesar de la cancelación del concierto de bienvenida al WorldPride, el sitio web oficial de WorldPride D.C. asegura que todos los demás eventos programados continuarán según lo planeado. Encuentra el programa completo aquí.


	La próxima parada de la gira mundial de Shakira Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran World Tour está programada para el lunes en el State Farm Arena de Atlanta.

	Three former members of the props department on ABC‘s medical drama Doctor Odyssey filed a lawsuit Friday against the network's parent company Disney and producer 20th Television, alleging they were subject to sexual harassment on the set of the series and eventually retaliated against and terminated when they complained about it.


	The suit, filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court, says the plaintiffs — Caroline Mack, Alicia Haverland and Ava Steinbrenner — were hired in late spring/early summer 2024 to work in the new series' props department. The defendants then hired Tammie Patton as Prop Master and her husband Tyler Patton as Assistant Prop Master who supervised and directed the plaintiffs in their work.

	











	The suit claims the props department “was an unlawful den of sexual harassment and retaliation,” and that the plaintiffs were subject to “an an unchecked campaign of sexual harassment for months” by “Taylor Patton and his male buddies.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Reps for Disney and 20th TV declined comment. 


	The behavior cited in the lawsuit (read it here) allegedly included “sexual jokes, innuendos, comments, sexual gestures and images, and unwanted touching including, but not limited to: (i) regularly giving Plaintiffs unwanted, lingering hugs; (ii) touching one of the Plaintiff's thighs; (iii) frequently placing his hands on one of the Plaintiff's lower back; (iv) placing his arms around Plaintiffs' necks and forcing them to “walk with him;” and (v) openly grabbing a visiting female employee's buttocks on set.”


	The suit said the plaintiffs eventually went to senior production members to report the misconduct including Tammie Patton, and say they were retaliated against by being forced to do demeaning tasks, and having their jobs threatened.


	“Even though Defendants' Human Resources Department and Senior Management assigned to Dr. Odyssey were fully aware of Tyler Patton's inappropriate behavior and the retaliation his wife/Plaintiffs' boss Tammie Patton engaged in, they took no action to prevent it,” says the suit. “In fact, Defendants' human resources was asleep at the wheel and permitted the frustrated managers/producers on set to handle these conflicts on their own. This led to Plaintiffs suffering additional mistreatment, retaliation, and emotional distress.”

	











	In the end, the plaintiffs say that rather than taking action against the alleged harassers, the defendants informed the entire props department in August that it was being terminated. That became effective at the end of September.


	“Defendants took the ‘easy' way out choosing to eliminate not only the wrongdoers — Prop Master Tammie Patton and Assistant Prop Master Tyler Patton — but all of the remaining employees in the Props Department who had been subject to the wrongdoers' misconduct,” the suit says.


	As a result, the plaintiffs are claiming wrongful termination in addition to claims of sexual harassment, failure to prevent harassment and retaliation.


	The suit also cites negligent hiring on the part of Disney, Fox and co-defendant Entertainment Partners, saying the defendants knew Tyler Patton had been subject to similar accusations and lawsuit on the set of the mid-2000s Fox medical drama series House. “Notably, there was some overlap between employees on Dr. Odyssey and employees on the set of House,” the suit says.


	The plaintiffs are seeking a jury trial.


Doctor Odyssey, from Ryan Murphy and starring Joshua Jackson and Don Johnson, debuted its first season in September and is on the bubble for a Season 2 pickup. It was not on ABC's fall 2025 schedule when that was announced earlier this month at the broadcast upfronts.

Though we picked it up at a Parisian pharmacy last summer, you don't actually need a plane ticket to get your hands on A313 — here's our honest review.


							By 

	Danielle Directo-Meston


E-Commerce Editor


	If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.


	On a pre-tariff trip to Paris last summer, we dedicated an afternoon to pick up some of the cult-favorite products known for giving the French their je ne sais quois. While we tabled our Polène shopping spree for another time (you'd think there was a Supreme drop based on the line wrapped around the boutique), we did manage to stop by the pharmacies to stock up on sunscreens and skin care not often found on U.S. shelves.


	Among the items we picked up was A313 pommade, a pharmaceutical-grade vitamin A retinoid cream manufactured by Pharma Développement available over the counter at pharmacies in France. This French favorite is known as a “miracle cream” that addresses fine lines, dark spots and acne — and after using it at least three times per week for the past eight months, we can confidently say we've seen smoother, plumper skin with A313 (more on that below).

	Unlike retinoids in the U.S., A313 doesn't require a prescription. In fact, you can now get the very same collagen-boosting formula but with a new, more absorbent texture on sale at Amazon — no plane ticket required. (We stil recommend consulting with your dermatologist before using the product.)


	A 50g tube (or 1.76 oz.) of A313 cost us somewhere between 16 to 18 Euros (or $18 to $20) in France — while that's about half the price at Amazon, it's still a steal compared to the $500 to $800 you'll spend on a plane ticket (don't forget hotels, restaurants and other travel expenses). Another plus in our book? The aluminum tube and plastic cap are easy to recycle.


	The product on Amazon comes directly from the manufacturer, but in English packaging. The active ingredient is 0.12 percent retinyl palmitate, a form of vitamin A that helps to boost collagen production, address hyperpigmentation, reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and smooth the skin's texture. 

	











	The cream we bought in France last year has a consistency similar to Vaseline, but slightly thicker and stickier. However, Pharma Développment says it recently “improved” the texture to “an advanced cream” that's smoother and absorbs quicker than the pomade version. 


	While in Paris, we had to ask a pharmacist to pull A313 for us from behind the counter. We were given clear instructions on how to use it: start with a pea-sized amount once or twice a week, use it only at night, always wear sunscreen and watch for any itching or peeling of the skin and other signs of sensitivity. (Dermatologists also recommend avoiding retinol and retinoids during the summer.)


	We followed the pharmacist's advice to a T, using A313 only at night about three times weekly as the last step in our skin-care routine. Since we started using it over eight months ago, we've seen our sun spots become less noticeable, while our skin feels smoother, bouncier and more hydrated. We have olive combination skin that's on the sensitive side, with some occasional rosacea on our cheekbones. The only irritation we experienced was minor itchiness after applying it over serum that was still wet, so we recommend waiting until your face is completely dry before using A313. (For the record, we're currently using Tatcha's Texture Tonic and The Essence, and Glo by Glen's L'eclat Vitality Elixir.)


	At the pharmacy, we also spent a good 20 minutes grabbing sunscreen from La Roche-Posay, Avène and Nuxe (European and Asian sunscreens are widely known to be more effective); Embryolisse‘s bestselling Lait-Crème Concentré; and drugstore body soaps and lotions (including our new favorite Le Petit Marseillais sweet almond milk body wash). Save for French SPFs, all of these are also available on Amazon — so you're (almost) getting your very own Parisian pharmacy experience at home.

The lawsuit details a culture on the set of the medical drama in which the assistant prop master, whose boss was his wife, allegedly subjected his employees to sexual comments and groping.


							By 

	Winston Cho



	Former crewmembers on Doctor Odyssey have sued 20th Television and parent company Disney over alleged sexual harassment and retaliation on the set of the medical drama.


	Caroline Mack, Alicia Haverland and Ava Steinbrenner, in a lawsuit filed on Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court, claim they were targets of an “unchecked campaign of sexual harassment” in which their supervisor bombarded them with sexual comments and unwanted touching. They say they were ultimately fired after they complained of the alleged misconduct to management.

	The plaintiffs reported to assistant prop master Tyler Patton, whose supervisor was his wife Tammie Patton. Tyler Patton was previously involved in a lawsuit from a former Universal Network Television employee, who advanced sexual harassment and retaliation allegations on the set of House. In that complaint, the employee Carl Jones claimed Patton groped his genitals and invited women from various production departments to engage in sexual activity.


	The lawsuit details a culture on the set of Doctor Odyssey in which Tyler Patton, who's not named as a defendant in the complaint, and his male colleagues repeatedly commented on their sexual preferences, with the intention of watching women in their orbit react uncomfortably to the commentary.


	In one incident, Tyler Patton allegedly referred to one of the former crewmembers as “mumbles” and told her to “swallow the cum before you talk.” Another involved him asking aloud to other employees why “no one had broke her” yet, the lawsuit claims. He regularly responded to benign statements with “that's what she said,” a sexual joke popularized from The Office, the complaint stated.


	The complaint claims that Tyler Patton regularly texted others pornographic materials, grabbed women crewmembers' butts, placed his arm around their necks and gave lingering hugs.

	











	The lawsuit alleges that Tyler Patton texted the props department, including his wife, prop master Tammie Patton, a link appearing to reference a new story that former President Joe Biden was dropping out of the 2024 presidential race. When they clicked, the crewmembers say they were directed to a webpage showing a naked male with an erect penis. Tyler Patton subsequently walked away and allegedly exclaimed, “If I wasn't fucking the boss, I'd be fired.”


	Mack later reported the incident to the human resources department and her union, which confirmed that 20th Century and Disney were aware of the alleged misconduct, the lawsuit says. This included complaints of the production mishandling replica firearms.


	Tyler Patton was terminated shortly after the complaint was issued, says the lawsuit, which notes that Tammie Patton started to retaliate against the plaintiffs by assigning them demeaning tasks and threatening their employment. The entire props department, outside of Tyler Patton's replacement, was later laid off in response to continuing complaints.


	20th “then almost immediately hired a whole new set of employees to replace Plaintiffs and other Props Department employees for the Dr. Odyssey Season 1 project,” states the complaint. “Clearly, no ‘lay off' had occurred. Instead, Defendants wiped the Prop Department's slate clean to avoid having to deal with any remaining employee-relations issues tied to Tyler Patton's and Tammie Patton's misconduct.”

	











	Since then, the plaintiffs claim they've been blacklisted from working on 20th and Disney productions.


	The lawsuit brings claims for sexual harassment, retaliation, wrongful termination and negligent hiring, among other claims. It seeks unspecified damages.


	20th and Disney didn't respond to requests for comment.


	The first-year drama from 20th and Ryan Murphy Television, starring Joshua Jackson as a cruise-ship physician, remains in limbo as the only current ABC scripted series still awaiting word on its future.

Fellow alum and 'White Lotus' creator Mike White has been cast in the upcoming season. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	Despite what fans might have wanted, Boston Rob Mariano wasn't interested in joining the cast of Survivor 50.


	A five-time alum of the beloved CBS series, The Traitors competitor was notably missing from the list of players announced earlier this week who will return to play in the landmark 50th season. However, Mariano revealed that host Jeff Probst “called and asked” him to return but that he was the one to shoot down the offer. 




	“@survivorcbs and @jeffprobst early on they called and asked… I just felt like I have played so many times and I am truly fulfilled with my Survivor journey,” he wrote on Instagram Friday. “I wanted my spot to go to someone else that deserved another chance!”

	Mariano made the post with a collage of photos of himself appearing to look upset with text that read, “Mood after finding out Boston Rob won't be joining ‘Survivor 50' cast.” He thanked fans for “all of your DM‘s and messages” when he wasn't announced as part of the upcoming pool of contestants, which are all competitors from Survivor past. 


	Entitled Survivor 50: In the Hands of the Fans, the landmark season will look much different than past seasons, as the fate of the show's structure was literally placed in the hands of its fans. Viewers were tasked with voting on key elements of the format throughout season 48, including whether or not the game will have idols, if contestants will be supplied with rice and if a live reunion will be filmed in Los Angeles. 


	However, viewers were not given the option of voting for which Survivor players they wanted to join the cast. Instead, alumni like The White Lotus creator Mike White, The Traitors season one winner (and four-time Survivor player) Cirie Fields, season 13's Ozzy Lusth, season 18's Benjamin “Coach” Wade and season 32's Aubry Bracco will be a part of the 50th season. 

	











	“I've gotten so much out of Survivor. It will always be a part of who I am,” Mariano concluded. “I'm eternally grateful. Like I said ..It's gonna be OK. I feel like something good is coming!!!” 


	Aside from the Survivor universe, Mariano recently competed in fellow reality TV competition series, The Traitors. He told The Hollywood Reporter his “reputation” as a legend of the CBS show put a “big target on me,” which led to him being banished during episode seven.

In other Canada music news, Quebec is imposing quotas for French-language content on streaming platforms.


The Billboard Summit is launching in Canada with a global superstar who made history in the country.


Diljit Dosanjh will be a special speaker at the event, which will launch at NXNE in Toronto's TIFF Lightbox on June 11, 2025.


	The record-setting artist made history with his Dil-Luminati tour last year, with his stadium concerts at Vancouver's BC Place and Toronto's Rogers Centre going down as the biggest ever Punjabi music events outside of India. The musician and movie star has continued to spread Punjabi culture worldwide, recently bringing historic fashion to the Met Gala.


	At the summit, Dosanjh will sit down for a special interview with another influential figure in the international music industry: Panos A. Panay, president of the Recording Academy, the organization behind the Grammys.


Billboard Canada has also announced two big performers for The Stage at NXNE. 


Daniel Caesar is returning to where he played his first major headlining show: The Mod Club in Toronto on June 14.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The venue will be reverting back to its original name of The Mod Club, rebranded by owner Live Nation from the name Axis Club for the first time since 2021.


	When he first played the venue, Caesar was a golden boy with a golden voice, gaining buzz with his EP Pilgrim's Paradise and still a year away from his classic 2017 debut, Freudian.


	In 2023, Caesar graduated to arenas, playing Madison Square Garden in New York and Scotiabank Arena in his hometown of Toronto. The Mod Club performance is a special, intimate show for his fans who have been with him from the beginning. A year after he played The Mod Club in 2017, Caesar also played NXNE — then an up-and-coming talent, and now, with the festival turning 30, an artist who has reached undeniable headliner status.


	After the last girls have left the party for their special DJ set on June 12, The Beaches will also play a special concert at a well-known Toronto venue on June 15.


	It's a big summer for the breakout Canadian band, with a recent festival set at Coachella and another big one this summer at Osheaga in Montreal. The Beaches' new album, No Hard Feelings, comes out Aug. 29 on AWAL.


	The band has also just announced the Canadian dates on its No Hard Feelings Tour, including its first hometown arena show at Scotiabank Arena on Nov. 6. The Beaches' special Billboard Canada Live show will be considerably more intimate, a chance to get up close and personal with the band at a surprise venue. – Richard Trapunski


	Quebec may soon be getting stricter language regulations on streaming services.


	Quebec Culture Minister Mathieu Lacombe tabled a new bill on May 21 that aims to add more French-language content to major streaming platforms, as well as increase its discoverability and accessibility by establishing quotas. The bill will directly impact platforms that offer media content such as music, TV, video and audiobooks, including giants like Netflix and Spotify.


	Lacombe wants to push French-language and Quebecian content to the forefront on these apps, saying it is not always readily available. He pointed out that consumption of local and French-language content is low, comprising just 8.5% of the music streamed in Quebec.


	In accordance with the bill, platforms would have to display their default interfaces in French within the province, also including platforms that produce original French-language content within that selection. Companies that disobey the rules could face financial penalties, although Lacombe says that those who cannot comply due to their business model can enter a deal with the Quebec government to establish “substitute rules.”


	The bill states that the Quebec government would have to establish content proportions or quotas on how much content needs to be produced or featured on these platforms, although no numbers were specified.


	Bill 109 — officially titled “An Act to affirm the cultural sovereignty of Quebec and to enact the Act respecting the discoverability of French-language cultural content in the digital environment” — will be closely tied to existing Quebec legislation and institutions. All platforms will be required to register with the Minister of Culture and Communications, and the bill will amend the right to access French-language cultural content in the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms.


	While Quebec is tightening regulations, the streaming services are already pushing back against existing content policies, arguing that the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) should not impose content obligations upon them. A CRTC hearing is currently underway from May 14 to 27 to outline a new definition of Canadian Content (CanCon), including regulations.


	Major companies have been pushing back against the CRTC's implementation of the Online Streaming Act in the hearing, which includes a plan to require major foreign streaming companies to invest in Canadian Content funds. – Stefano Rebuli

“Aria” by Michael Ballard (independently published). 39 pp. $12.95 paperback.

Okay, poet Michael Ballard hooked this reader at his back-cover, self-generated blurbs: They're blurbs as if written by Walt Whitman (… “do not stand idly by for word of mouth, do not accept the tepid reviews of stodgy critics”), by Emily Dickinson (… “am happy to report I did experience a pleasant chill”), and by Billy Collins (“good luck, all the same”). This collection is serious enough but refreshingly witty.

Ballard, who wrote “on and off most of his adult life,” only turned to poetry at age 66. That being a mortality-aware time of life, many of these poems deal with death. Fortunately, Ballard's death-awareness often highlights the pleasures of living.

Themes are universal. Topics are everyday — grocery shopping, dental appointments — but Ballard punches the unusual into them — “geezer Wednesdays” eliminate the shopper's need to make choices; the dentist's “hm” sets off speculation on why that ubiquitous sound hasn't made its way into the dictionary.

The poems' real pleasure often comes with Ballard's final line, as in this reflection on the glory of the night sky: “…the cosmos will never/ be able to treasure its own terrifying/ beauty. Only we, we futile ticks on/ the hide of eternity, have the power/ to give the indifferent incandescence its due. /

“It should thank its lucky stars.”

See what I mean?

“I, Ghost: A Paranormal Autobiography” by R.L. Clayton (R. Clayton International Enterprise, Inc.). 341 pp. $16.99 paperback; $4.99 e-book.

R. L. Clayton addresses his audience directly in the opening of this book. He, as everyone else, he writes, wonders about life after death. Good behavior = Paradise; bad behavior = Hell. Trained as an engineer, he decided to apply logic to answering life-after-death questions, and he writes that he thinks he nailed it.

This reader agrees.





“I, Ghost” opens with the first-person character in the middle of a series of tortures. He has been regularly waterboarded, frozen and thawed, and drugged until his memory and name have been eradicated. Now he's being electro-shocked. His torturer steps out, and his son — against explicit orders — picks up the controls, ratchets up the power, and kills our character. As he dies, he sees below him the two torturers — father Leon and 17-year-old Jon — and is overcome with a desire for revenge. He can't let it go.

He then finds himself in an afterlife full of souls like his — dead but tied somehow to the world of the living. A single notion seems to keep them linked. They, like he, had had a choice to continue their passage, but elected to remain close to their sources. There is no joy in this dimension.

The story is that our character has been part of a biomedical experiment in which criminals can avoid execution by participating in vaccine development. Our character discovers he can invade the minds and dreams of living souls, which comes in handy when an insidious international threat arises. Interestingly, the plot in this novel — different from Clayton's normal action novels — seems secondary to “I, Ghost” as a meditation on the psychology of torture, the nature of the afterlife and the soul, an exploration of good and evil, and the possibility of redemption. It's a worthy read.

“Urban Trails Tucson” by Sirena Rana (Mountaineers Books). 288 pp. $18.95.

This handsome pack-sized guidebook is a must-have for hiking in the Tucson area. It includes 65 color photos, 43 maps, plant and animal guides, cultural background, geographic notes, trail descriptions and key trail details such as distance, elevation gain, difficulty, fitness suitability, family- and dog-friendliness, amenities, etc.

Author Sirena Rana, founder of Trails Inspire, proves an engaging guide as she weaves personal anecdotes in the entries featuring 47 trails of varying levels of difficulty in and around Tucson. Put a copy in your guest room and tuck one into your day pack. You won't regret it.

“War for the Stars: End of Earth, Book 3” by Matt Simons (Independently published). 223 pp. $11.99 paperback; available in e-book.

Tucsonan Matt Simons says the story that has become his “End of the Earth” series came to him when he was a kid. It's evolved since. In this, Book 3, Earth is threatened by an interstellar alien species that has already conquered much of the galaxy. Thanks to the knowledge, Jason Baker passed to a friend in Book 2 — before he was flung back in time by a WW III nuclear blast — the U.S. has perfected a secret means to open corridors through space. Using that technology, Earth forces, led by four physically enhanced modern men and one 13,000-year-old one, will go to interstellar war.

You will like seeing Jason again, even though he's cast back in time to his pre-war innocence, and it's painful for him to be with the friends who would die before his eyes.

At the close of this volume, Simons invites readers to join him “as we slowly close in on The End of Earth. I'll be there.”

A scientist has issued an ominous message to humanity after a UFO covered in unexplained and weird writing was discovered - potentially changing the future of our knowledge of aliens.

Dr Julia Mossbridge, a cognitive neuroscientist and a researcher of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPS), which is a new term for UFO sightings, says we may as a human race soon have to deal with the fact that aliens may well exist and move into a new era of our understanding.

It comes as more and more information is being released about alleged contact with UFOs and extraterrestrials. Specifically, the discovery of an unusual, sphere-shaped object found in Columbia that scientists believe could be a piece of UFO technology.

The object displays symbols akin to ancient scripts like runes and scientists have used AI to try to help decipher the strange text, with Dr Mossbridge telling Fox News: "We are entering a time when we are starting to recognize as humans we don't have the control that we thought we had over everything."

She believes the potential disclosure of alien life could throw many people and the world into chaos as they try to cope with the knowledge of their existence.

"One of the mistakes we make is [saying] because I think I understand this, everything I think today is true," she said, adding that it makes people confused when something shows up that doesn't "fit our model of the world."

Mossbridge herself remains sceptical that this discovery is a genuine UFO but much of the public remains convinced. "The sphere itself seems kind of like an art project," she added.

"If an artist is doing this, why is that? Well, I think it's partly the same reason. It's because we're learning that we don't understand what's in our skies or our waters. And there's something going on that's essentially bigger than us."

On the other hand, Dr Jose Luis Velazquez, a radiologist who examined the sphere said he found no clues that would typically be found on the sphere had humans made it.

"It is of artificial origin, in that it shows no evidence of welding, and its internal structure is composed of high-density elements. More testing is needed to establish its origin," he said.

Mail Online reports that his team of researchers used AI to assist in deciphering the design and found it to read: "The origin of birth through union and energy in the cycle of transformation, meeting point of unity, expansion, and consciousness — individual consciousness."

They said: "We interpret it as a message to humanity, encouraging a collective shift in consciousness to help Mother Earth—especially considering the current issues with pollution and environmental decline."

In similar circumstances, a set of three-fingered alien mummies have been baffling scientists since they were discovered in 2017 in the Nazca desert and now scientists say they are 1,200 years old.

Also at times dismissed as merely an art project, the ‘alien' mummies of Peru may have actually been murdered, experts believe. Scientists examining the mysterious three-fingered bodies with elongated skulls have made new findings they claim prove the specimens are ‘100% real'.

Some of the injuries they suffered suggest they experienced violent deaths - and may have been bumped off. Discovered in 2017 in Peru's Nazca desert the mummies were presented to the world in Mexico two years ago as possible fossilised remains of extraterrestrials who were not part of Earth's evolutionary chain.

Initial DNA analysis showed they were part-human and part 'unknown species', prompting Mexico's first congressional hearing on UFOs.

The Annabelle doll's tour across the country sparked theories that the famously haunted relic was responsible for chaotic events that followed, but Annabelle's keepers have rebuked the fiery claims in exclusive interviews with DailyMail.com. 

Annabelle, a famously haunted Raggedy Anne doll, started a tour earlier this month ahead of a Psychic Festival, making stops in West Virginia, Louisiana, and Texas. 

The doll's famous history began in 1970 after it had been gifted to a Hartford nurse and then began moving on her own and, in one instance, allegedly attacked the owner's fiancé. 

Lorraine and Ed Warren, renowned paranormal researchers and founders of Warren's Occult Museum, investigated the doll's paranormal activity and gave her a permanent spot in their museum. 

She was displayed in a protective case, fitted with carved prayers and crosses as well as a sign made by Ed Warren, which read, 'Warning: Positively Do Not Open.' 

The Warrens had always warned about moving Annabelle but for those who took the doll on tour they vehemently defended doing so and say it is what the Warrens would have wanted.

NESPR Lead Investigator into the paranormal, Chris Gilloren, who was part of the tour team, told DailyMail.com: '[Annabelle's] not a spectacle, but it's a great way to get people talking about evil. That's what Ed and Lorraine wanted to do. They wanted to expose the devil, and tell people, advise people that the devil is real.'

Ryan Buell, a paranormal investigator who also joined the tour, agreed that it was about education and continuing to spread the work of Ed and Lorraine Warren. 

Annabelle just completed her tour across the US with the New England Society for Psychic Research, making stops in West Virginia, Louisiana and Texas, but what followed her were a series of unfortunate events that the public linked to the haunted doll

'We keep the legacy and name of Ed and Lorraine alive. That they devoted their lives to this work, that there are people our there who still dedicate their own lives to helping people who are having these experiences,' Buell said. 

'It's not that people just went in and saw a doll and they're like, 'oh cool.' We sat there and we talked to people. We talked about the dangers. We talk about the precautions.' 

But the tour was not without it's strange and creepy moments that fueled wild online speculation on Annabelle's ability to leave a path of destruction as she moved around the country.         

On May 15, as Annabelle left Louisiana - her second tour stop - the historic 166-year-old Nottoway Plantation was destroyed in a blazing fire. 

Online speculation quickly turned to the doll's close presence as the reason the historic site went up in flames, but her caretakers are not convinced. 

Gilloren said: 'I don't know where these people come up with these... I mean, it's taken off, it's got a mind of its own. 

'We don't think it has anything to do with us, of course, or Annabelle.' 

One post on X connected the dots on May 19 and wrote: 'Three days ago they moved Annabelle, one of the most haunted dolls from Monroe, Connecticut, to New Orleans, Louisiana, and now the largest sugarcane plantation in Louisiana burned down AND 11 inmates in a New Orleans Prison escape...'

'I don't know where these people come up with these... I mean, it's taken off, it's got a mind of its own. We don't think it has anything to do with us, of course, or Annabelle,' Gilloren said

'Didn't the Warren's say she should never be move,' the post concluded.  

Another comment said: 'Taking her down here where there's voodoo and spirits everywhere is actually an idiot move I have to say.' 

Many other social media users worried about their own cities, and even contacted those monitoring Annabelle. 

'...the amount of messages, emails that I received through our websites and social medias... they truly believe Annabelle did all this, which makes no sense to me personally... you know, why would she burn it down?' Gilloren said. 

Gilloren said he believed that the events were purely coincidental. 

Speaking to Buell, DailyMail.com pointed out the route Annabelle took as she left Louisiana. He examined the route through the state and said: 'This is the first time I've ever looked. Okay, yes, I can confirm we were within five miles [of the plantation] on the freeway. And, yes, it was on the same day.

'So, I mean, yes, that is a very bizarre coincidence.' 

Yet, Buell said there was an even stranger occurrence before they left New Orleans - a voodoo Priestess who 'challenged' Annabelle. 

Just days after Annabelle left New Orleans, a group of 'violent' inmates escaped the New Orleans Parish Jail which the public also linked to the haunted doll's nearby presence 

'We were packing up and all of a sudden we heard tambourines and someone's screaming, 'Go to hell, Annabelle.' She laid holy water down and said, 'In the name of New Orleans voodoo, I rebuke you.'... but I mean, there was the thought of, yikes, this priestess just challenged Annabelle,' Buell said

'We were like, 'wait, so we're being blamed for what? A plantation? Somewhere in Louisiana? Louisiana, okay, well probably coincidence,' But I mean, I kind of thought, well, there was this voodoo priestess who challenged Annabelle when we were leaving,' he recalled. 

'We were packing up and all of a sudden we heard tambourines and someone's screaming, 'Go to hell, Annabelle,'' Buell said. 

'She laid holy water down and said, 'In the name of New Orleans voodoo, I rebuke you.'... but I mean, there was the thought of, yikes, this priestess just challenged Annabelle. It was almost like voodoo versus the demonic,' he continued. 

'And so... there was that creeping thought of, 'what if,'' Buell said. 

Theories that blamed Annabelle for the fire and escaped inmates were just the tip of the iceberg of the strange goings on during the doll's time on the road. 

'To our knowledge, it's the first time we brought Annabelle to another haunted location, especially that far out,' Buell said, of their first tour stop in West Virginia State Penitentiary, a famously haunted building. 

'What was weird - and I've been to the penitentiary many, many times - when Annabelle was in the prison, the activity around the prison was low.' 

Buell added that they had psychic mediums with them in the prison who said that other 'spirits' were 'staying at a distance'. 

Buell recalled how things got 'aggressive' as they used a spirit box to communicate with Annabelle on tour, and said: 'People would ask questions, 'who's here with us? Is the entity around Annabelle here?'...suddenly it started to turn to like, 'You b***. I want your body''

Buell said that he had visited the West Virginia State Penitentiary numerous times before, but that Annabelle's presence had quietened other spirit activity he had experienced before. Pictured: Ryan Buell in front of the WV State Penitentiary

While on tour, the team included psychic mediums as well as priests, including Father Bob Bailey who helped bless the team and their equipment for protection against Annabelle's spirit

'[The spirits are] just kind of watching. A couple were saying they felt uneasy,' Buell said. 

'They didn't know what that meant. Then when we took Annabelle out, you know, we're wrapped up... Then the activity picked up. 

'And the two employees who were there, who regularly witnessed the activity, they pulled me to the side and said, 'look, they don't like it that Annabelle is here. They don't like its energy, so they're hanging back.'' 

After Annabelle had left, other activity picked up again. Buell recalled his previous experiences at the prison, without Annabelle. 

'You'll hear whispers. You'll hear footsteps. And then especially in the infirmary on the second floor. That place is so active,' he said. 'You'll literally hear bangings if you say, hey, knock for me. You'll hear intelligent responses, you know, knocking back.' 

He described his experience within the infirmary as feeling like 'prey'.

'You're very well aware of the fact that you're being watched. You feel like something is literally following you and you start to feel a sense of danger,' he added, recalling that he heard bangs and the slamming of doors around him. 

Annabelle's presence at the penitentiary was not only felt by the spirits within the building, but also those who came in for the tour. 

'I started getting really intrusive thoughts, and Wade had to remind me that the demonic often use psychological tactics, so we just doused ourselves in holy water and kept going,' Buell said of their first day with Annabelle. Pictured: Ryan Buell with the cinematic version of the Annabelle doll

Buell recalled how things got 'aggressive' as they used a spirit box to communicate with the doll, who inspired The Conjuring and Annabelle movie franchises.

He said the process involves one person listening with noise cancelling headphones, only able to hear what's going on inside the box, while those outside ask questions. 

'It's pulling from like public radio stations, right? The spirit box. It just randomly jumps from station to station and pulls sounds and voices from it,' Buell said. 

'People would ask questions, 'who's here with us? Is the entity around Annabelle here?' and suddenly the answers.. suddenly it started to turn to like, 'You b***. I want your body.' Some other stuff.' 

'...I remember at one point I was like okay, I'm done. This energy is getting a little too weird. And so we had another person do it and then they got very emotional,' he continued. 

Despite having worked with Annabelle many times before, Buell still found himself sensing a strange energy surrounding the doll. 

'In New Orleans, myself and Wade, who is a member of NESPR, were mainly the ones giving the talks about the Warren's... and so we would have to stand in front of Annabelle for hours,' he said. 

'And the first day, Wade and I looked at each other and we're like, the energy is so off, like it feels so weird and he totally agreed.'

'We keep the legacy and name of Ed and Lorraine alive. That they devoted their lives to this work, that there are people our there who still dedicate their own lives to helping people who are having these experiences,' Buell said

Gilleron added: '[Annabelle's] not a spectacle, but it's a great way to get people talking about evil. That's what Ed and Lorraine wanted to do. They wanted to expose the devil, and tell people, advise people that the devil is real'

'I started getting really intrusive thoughts, and Wade had to remind me that the demonic often use psychological tactics, so we just doused ourselves in holy water and kept going,' Buell recalled. 

But even with Annabelle's unnerving presence, her keepers defended the doll against the spiral of rumors that Annabelle had caused the chaos along their route. 

'I mean, she was down in San Antonio and I really haven't heard of anything happening in San Antonio. She was in West Virginia. I haven't heard anything up in West Virginia happening,' Gilloren said. 

'She's in Connecticut. I mean she's been in Connecticut for 50 years. We don't blame every kind of disaster on Annabelle,' he added. 

Anabelle's tour continues in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania from July 11-13 and then in Rock Island, Illinois, from October 4-5.

A startling video has captured a clear view of what a witness believes was a giant UFO flying over California.

The video, recorded on April 27 by an anonymous resident in Twentynine Palms, follows a brightly lit hexagonal-shaped object as it flies over the desert.

The UFO reportedly appeared out of nowhere at around 22:27 p.m. local time, while the witness was standing in an isolated cabin.

According to the report the witness submitted to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) two days later, the suspected spacecraft was moving very slowly and erratically, as if it was in a state of confusion.

"It appeared to move arbitrarily, without any clear direction. The movements were erratic and at varying speeds," the witness wrote in the report to NUFORC - GazetaExpress reports.

The large object also appeared to pulse, emitting bright light from its edges, as it moved across the sky for about 15 minutes.

“Tonight is the new moon – so it was probably not the moon, and yet it was much brighter than a full moon,” the witness continued.

"What stood out was its extraordinary lighting and strange shape and irregular movements," he added.

As the witness in Twentynine Palms followed the UFO, he added that the strange object began to change shape – going from a hexagonal object to a circular shape.

The person who recorded the video on his phone was the only witness in the cabin that night, so no one else was able to confirm the event.

However, he stated in his report to NUFORC that he had not taken any type of perception-affecting substance during the observation and that he had had clear vision throughout.

NUFORC officials attempted to find an explanation for the event, noting that a SpaceX rocket launch had taken place that day, but the Falcon 9 rocket had been launched from Florida three hours earlier.

A previous rocket launch had created a similar phenomenon over Great Britain in March.

That strange shape, according to experts, was caused by the glowing frozen fuel being released from the SpaceX rocket.

The blue spiral is formed when excess fuel released from the rapidly spinning rocket rises, reflecting sunlight into the upper atmosphere – giving it an otherworldly glow – before turning into water vapor.

This new sighting occurred just days before a hearing in the US Congress on UFOs and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).

Speakers, including Pentagon UFO project whistleblower Luis Elizondo, a former NASA administrator and a retired Navy admiral, called on the government to publish what it knows about these unexplained sightings.

They also called for increased funding for the detection of UFOs and UAPs, which, according to some of the speakers, were being suppressed by the American intelligence community.

Elizondo and others pointed out that witnesses like the one in Twentynine Palms have no official central channel in the U.S. to report UFO sightings.

For this reason, many potential reports remain unreported or are never investigated by the military or federal authorities.

NUFORC and the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) are two of the most well-known civilian organizations that keep records of citizen sightings.

Although these two organizations are not affiliated with the government, they often share data with researchers or state institutions when important cases occur. /Express newspaper/

Supernatural ended after 15 seasons, but the fact that the franchise retconned Dean Winchester's ending two years later shows how easily the series can return. Every season of Supernatural built its fan base from small and cult-like to a pop culture icon, with the ending igniting inevitable controversy. Running from 2005 to 2020, the show was led by Jensen Ackles as Dean Winchester and Jared Padalecki as Sam Winchester, and a lot of people didn't want to see it end.

Airing on November 19, 2020, the Supernatural season 15 finale saw the Winchester brothers defeating the final boss - God himself. The stakes couldn't get any higher. Then, in a move that some saw as anticlimactic and others saw as perfectly fitting, Dean eventually died in a run-of-the-mill vampire hunt. Sam grew old and eventually joined Dean and Bobby in heaven. Cast, crew, and fans alike have long debated the possibility of a return for Supernatural, be it in another season, a movie, or a reboot. But The Winchesters made it clear just how easy this would be.

 Perhaps the most important of the Supernatural spinoffs is The Winchesters, which brought Dean Winchester back onto screens two years after Supernatural ended. Developed by Robbie Thompson with Ackles serving as executive producer, The Winchesters followed a young John and Mary. However, the spinoff was seemingly deviating from canon, particularly regarding Mary's past and how much she knew about John and the threats their family would face.

But at the end, it was revealed that Dean, who was narrating the story, had been in heaven, searching for a world where the Winchesters had a happy ending. In other words, The Winchesters took place in an alternate universe. Dean had fought threats to the multiverse that he encountered along the way, proving how easily he could return to the story.

Sam and Dean Winchester had a jarring ending that took many by surprise. Fortunately, despite its flaws, The Winchesters provided some more closure to it. Dean had died abruptly, and Sam's long life and eventual death were encapsulated in one episode. This may have felt like an insufficient end to a fifteen-year series, but The Winchesters was determined to add some clarity and potential to the fates of the brothers.

The Winchesters paraded as a prequel story, but in reality, it was a Supernatural epilogue.

Elaborating on Dean's time in heaven, The Winchesters confirmed that Dean was still saving the world, even after his death. This made his death easier to handle and opened up the possibility of a comeback.

The Winchesters paraded as a prequel story, but in reality, it was a Supernatural epilogue, and its handling of Dean Winchester's story proves how easily the franchise could return. Eric Kripke has said that he won't bring Supernatural back unless he has a good story for it (Collider). However, The Winchesters set one up. The show may have been canceled for various reasons, but one thing it did well was establish a foundation for the Winchesters in a Supernatural season 16 or reboot. Dean, Sam, and Bobby are together again, and still a thorn in evil's side.

Dean Winchester was killed in the controversial Supernatural series finale, but the franchise gave him a more fitting epilogue two years later.

Supernatural writer and producer Robbie Thompson and Supernatural star Jensen Ackles were well-situated to build on the original show for a new series. They did so well, despite whatever problems The Winchesters may have had. A new season, movie, or reboot of Supernatural can explore the multiverse and what Sam, Dean, and Bobby got up to in heaven. The Winchesters is just one of many examples of how death is not really an ending in Supernatural, and how, if there were to be a new season, Sam and Dean could easily return.

Great eared nightjars live on the forest floor, remaining motionless throughout the day, camouflaged among leaf litter and tree stumps.

Name: Great eared nightjar (Lyncornis macrotis)

Where it lives: Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam

What it eats: Moths, beetles and other flying insects

With its large, forward-facing eyes and head tufts that look like ears, the great eared nightjar resembles a dragon more than a bird. Often nicknamed the "baby dragon," this otherworldly-looking creature has several distinctive traits, including an eerie, haunting call.

Great eared nightjars, which reach between 12 and 16 inches (30 to 40 centimeters) in length, live in dense, low-lying woodlands across South and Southeast Asia. These elusive, nocturnal birds are masters of camouflage and blend into the forest floor, thanks to their mottled brown, gray and black plumage. By day, they remain motionless among leaf litter or tree stumps, with their coloring protecting them from predators.

Rather than building a traditional nest, the great eared nightjar lays a single egg directly on the forest floor or in a shallow bed of leaves. While the exact reason they avoid nesting in trees like many other birds remains uncertain, it's likely that their natural camouflage offers effective protection for both egg and chick against predators.

Their habitat is often dense with vegetation and trees, making it difficult for predators to find the birds and their eggs. Both parents incubate the egg until it hatches. Once the chick has emerged, it remains camouflaged on the forest floor where it is fed by its parents until it can fend for itself.

—Great potoo: The 'tree stump' bird with a haunting growl and can see with its eyes closed

—Turkey vulture: The bird that vomits acid up to 10 feet and poops antiseptic onto its legs

Despite their dragon-like appearance, great eared nightjars feed primarily on moths and other flying insects, which they catch mid-air in the twilight hours using their wide, gaping mouths. Their flight is silent and smooth, allowing them to hunt quickly and efficiently without alerting predators, such as owls and other birds of prey.

The call of the great eared nightjar is a deep, haunting sound that echoes through the forest at dusk and dawn. This distinctive call includes a sharp "tsiik" noise followed by a pause and a longer, whistle-like call. Nightjars rely on these vocalizations to breed. Males often use their calls to mark their territories, attract mates or warn others of dangers.

Despite the success of the Europa Clipper's test prototype, going to the moon now seems unlikely. However, it could be heading for Enceladus instead.

NASA's originally planned lander to Europa was cancelled in 2023, but the technology behind it could be used to explore Enceladus instead, the organization has announced. Called the Europa Clipper, it was initially scheduled to arrive at Europa in 2030, and despite successful testing of a prototype, Europa was deemed too hostile for mission success.

So, why was there all the interest in the first place? Well, Europa (a moon of Jupiter) and Enceladus (a moon of Saturn) both have subsurface oceans beneath their icy crusts. 

These oceans might harbor life, making them two of the most promising places to look for extraterrestrial life in our solar system. NASA's Europa Clipper mission, should it have gone ahead, would have gathered data about Europa's potential habitability.

The original plan was that if the Clipper found good evidence (such as signs of water chemistry suitable for life), then a robotic lander might be sent to search for biosignatures. Or, in other words, signs of life.

But this wouldn't have been an easy mission for the team or the lander. Europa suffers from intense radiation from Jupiter, which damages electronics. There would also be limited communication time due to Europa's orbit, less than half of each 85-hour day.

The lander would also have to rely solely on battery power, as solar panels would need to be restrictively big, given the distance from the Sun. The surface is also extremely cold (−224°F to −364°F or −160°C to −220°C) and would lack communication satellites orbiting the moon to help relay data.

Yet despite the challenges, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) built a prototype robot to prepare for a possible Europa landing. This lander features legs that enable it to land and operate on Europa's icy surface safely.

It also features a stereoscopic camera with lights to enable “see” and navigation, as well as a special drill arm equipped with sensors to prevent breakage. One of its primary tools is the so-called “ICEPICK” tool, which allows for the collection of samples up to 7.87 inches (20 cm) deep.

The lander also features autonomous software to help it decide what to do with limited power and time, as well as control individual movements and operations. It passed rigorous field tests on Alaska's Matanuska Glacier (which has harsh, icy terrain similar to Europa).

In 2023, the new planetary science decadal strategy (which sets NASA's 10-year priorities) did not recommend the Europa lander. Europa's radiation made it unlikely that biosignatures could survive long enough to be detectable on the surface.

But the story isn't over for the lander; it may make an appearance on Enceladus instead. This moon of Jupiter has less radiation than Europa and potentially has water plumes that contain molecules needed for life.

For these reasons, its surface might preserve biosignatures longer. To this end, much of the robot design and lessons learned from Europa tests can be reused for a mission to Enceladus.

The dream of exploring Europa's deep ocean with a submersible still lives, but it's a giant technological leap. For now, flybys and landings on more accessible moons like Enceladus are more feasible.

The study has been published in the journal Science Robotics.

Johnson

U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson has again waded into long-debunked conspiracy theories, suggesting without evidence that someone, presumably with the government, imploded one of the buildings destroyed in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks hours after the Twin Towers collapsed.

Speaking with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson on Wednesday, Johnson, R-Oshkosh, said his interest in the attack on New York City, particularly regarding Building 7, a 47-story office building that fell several hours after planes were flown into the nearby Twin Towers, is “because the 9/11 families want to know the answer.”

“I'm just as prone as everyone else to go, ‘Well, that's wacko. That's a conspiracy,'” Johnson said. “But then you start getting the information and you start going, ‘Wow, is that weird.'”

“Building number 7 — you see it come down — and we've all watched, because it's cool to watch these buildings being demolished, boom, just freefall,” Johnson said. “The only way that happens is if you remove all of their supports at the same time. You blow them all out so a building can really free-fall. If it's collapsing from something else, it's like, you know, you build like a fire, and it collapses off to the side or something, right?”

The National Institute of Standards and Testing concluded that uncontrolled fires caused by debris from one of the center's Twin Towers caused steel beams and girders to expand, “leading to a chain of events that caused a key structural column to fail.

“The failure of this structural column then initiated a fire-induced progressive collapse of the entire building,” the group stated in the final report on its investigation.

Speaking with conservative radio host Meg Ellefson a day later, Johnson again cited the 2020 film “Calling Out Bravo 7,” a production he's referenced in the past that questions the official story behind the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 in New York.

“And as we find out, in so many different instances, you really can't trust the government what they told you,” Johnson said. “I mean, the government has just repeatedly lied to the American public for decades on so many different issues. It's sad. It shouldn't happen, but it does.”

In a statement, Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokesperson Phil Shulman criticized Johnson's remarks.

“Almost 3,000 Americans died in the 9/11 attacks — and Ron Johnson thinks it's ‘cool' to watch buildings collapse as a result of the worst terrorist attack on American soil,” Shulman said. “It seems Ron Johnson could not care less about the devastation these attacks caused on our country.”

Johnson's latest comments come about a month after the the Oshkosh Republican told conservative podcaster Benny Johnson he believes there are “an awful lot of questions” surrounding one of the deadliest attacks on the United States.

Johnson, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, has called for more congressional hearings on the attacks while also criticizing as “corrupt” the investigation carried out by the standards and technology institute.

The institute's final report was the work of more than 200 experts, including scientists and engineers, and found that Building 7 collapsed due to the hours-long fire that consumed much of the building and inadequate water pressure to combat the fire.

“Had a water supply for the automatic sprinkler system been available and had the sprinkler system operated as designed, it is likely that fires in (Building 7) would have been controlled and the collapse prevented,” the report states.

"I mean, the government has just repeatedly lied to the American public for decades on so many different issues. It's sad. It shouldn't happen, but it does."

Friday brought the most anticipated game of the 2025 MLB season to date, as the New York Yankees traveled to Chavez Ravine for a World Series rematch against the Los Angeles Dodgers. And it didn't take long for it to live up to the billing: Aaron Judge went yard in the game's second at-bat. 

And then, not to be outdone, Shohei Ohtani followed suit on the very first pitch of the bottom half.

The sport's two best hitters, both going deep before everyone had even gotten to their seats. But that was just the beginning of the fireworks: There were five homers just in the first three innings of this game, with Austin Wells, Trent Grisham and Paul Goldschmidt all going yard to help New York build an early 5-2 lead. 

Two massive media markets? Check. The game's two biggest stars? Check. A slew of highlight-reel plays? Check. Rob Manfred himself could hardly have written a more perfect opening script for the most significant game of the year. In fact, maybe the script was a little too perfect — and baseball fans couldn't help but take notice.

For more news and rumors, check out MLB Insider Robert Murray's work on The Baseball Insiders podcast, subscribe to The Moonshot, our weekly MLB newsletter, and join the discord to get the inside scoop during the MLB season.

Allegations that MLB was "juicing" its baseballs in order to increase offense first picked up steam in the late 2010s, amid a resurgence in home runs around the league. Manfred himself more or less confirmed the theory at the 2019 All-Star Game, admitting that "our scientists that have been now studying the baseball more regularly have told us that this year the baseball has a little less drag."

As the years went by and MLB revamped its production process and the pendulum swung back in favor of pitchers, the fervor all but died away. But all it took was a rash of suspiciously effortless homers between the league's two richest franchises in order to make everybody a believer again.

Is it likely that MLB saw to it that unique balls found their way to Dodger Stadium ahead of this weekend? Not really. Then again, when you've already been proven to have tinkered with the baseballs previously — and when a certain kind of baseball already found its way to Judge and the Yankees during his chase for the AL home run record back in 2022 — you've forfeited the benefit of the doubt.

This is a perception problem more than anything. Manfred is a figure that fans have never been able to trust, both because he has a hard time communicating clearly and effectively and also because he has a habit of doing some head-scratching stuff. Overall, it gives the impression that the league is making things up as they go along and doesn't have any qualms about putting its thumb on the scale. From there, it's only natural for conspiracy theories to take root.
