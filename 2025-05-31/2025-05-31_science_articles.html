                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>$83 billion has just been sitting there underground this whole time. A deposit of gold ore recently discovered in China isn't just giant. So much so, in fact, that Chinese experts claim it could be the largest deposit of any precious metal—not just gold ore—in existence today. According to Chinese state media, a team of geologists detected over 40 gold veins of roughly 330 tons of gold ore dipping 6,600 feet deep under Pingjiang County's Wangu gold field. Adding some more heft to the already weighty (literally) find was the report that the new discovery features 138 grams of gold per metric ton of ore, a valuable rate not often found in gold mining. “Many drilled rock cores showed visible gold,” said Chen Rulin, an ore-prospecting expert at China's Hunan Province's Geological Bureau, according to Chinese state media. If the 1,100-ton figure holds up, that makes this new find the largest gold mine in the world, even outpacing South Africa's South Deep gold mine with its 1,025 tons of gold, according to Mining Technology. Mines in Indonesia, Russia, New Guinea, and Chile round out the top-five gold mines in the world. Already the world's top gold producer with about 10 percent of global production, China is heavily dependent on the metal, using about three times more gold than it mines annually. This new discovery has put the world's gold markets on notice, enough so that the price of gold rose to $2,700 per ounce, according to CCN.com. And the gold news may not stop there. According to Liu Yongjun, vice head of the bureau, additional gold ore was found when drilling around the site's peripheral areas. Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A pilot study from Michigan Medicine researchers found that the Mediterranean diet may provide symptom relief for people with irritable bowel syndrome. The low FODMAP diet leads to symptom improvement in more than half of patients, but is restrictive and hard to follow. Previous investigations from Michigan Medicine researchers into more accessible alternative diets led to a proposed "FODMAP simple," which attempted to only restrict the food groups in the FODMAP acronym that are most likely to cause symptoms. "Restrictive diets, such as low FODMAP, can be difficult for patients to adopt," said Prashant Singh, MBBS, Michigan Medicine gastroenterologist and lead author on the paper. "In addition to the issue of being costly and time-consuming, there are concerns about nutrient deficiencies and disordered eating when trying a low FODMAP diet. The Mediterranean diet is already popular among physicians for its benefits to cardiovascular, cognitive, and general health. In this pilot study, two groups of patients were provided with either a Mediterranean diet or the restriction phase of a low FODMAP diet for four weeks. The primary endpoint was an FDA-standard 30% reduction in abdominal pain intensity after four weeks. All the patients included in the study were diagnosed with either IBS-D (diarrhea) or IBS-M (mixed symptoms of constipation or diarrhea). While the Mediterranean diet did provide symptom relief, the low FODMAP group experienced a greater improvement measured by both abdominal pain intensity and IBS symptom severity score. Researchers found the results of this pilot study -- which 20 patients completed -- sufficiently encouraging to warrant future, larger controlled trials to investigate the potential of the Mediterranean diet as an effective intervention for patients with IBS.
