                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Union on Saturday criticized President Donald Trump's move to double tariffs on steel imports, warning that it "undermines" efforts to reach a "negotiated solution" in the ongoing trade war. "We strongly regret the announced increase of U.S. tariffs on steel imports from 25% to 50%," an EU spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News. "This decision adds further uncertainty to the global economy and increases costs for consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic," the spokesperson continued. The United Steelworkers union (USW) also criticized Trump's announcement and said it is a "direct attack on Canadian industries and workers." "Thousands of Canadian jobs are on the line and communities that rely on steel and aluminum are being put at risk," Marty Warren, United Steelworkers National Director for Canada, said in a statement. The new import duties are set to go into effect June 4. His announcement, made at a rally at U.S. Steel in Pennsylvania, came after the president signaled earlier this month that he would approve a controversial deal between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel. Trump highlighted an "agreement" between Nippon and U.S. Steel during the Friday rally, but said that the deal was not yet final. He said that there will be no layoffs and "no outsourcing whatsoever" due to the deal. The EU, which said that it had paused its countermeasures against the U.S. on April 14 "to allow time and space" for negotiations, said it is prepared to instate those measures "if no mutually acceptable solution is reached." "If no mutually acceptable solution is reached, both existing and additional EU measures will automatically take effect on 14 July — or earlier, if circumstances require." The Trump administration's tariff plan hit a snag this week after the U.S. Court of International Trade halted nearly all of Trump's country-specific tariffs on the grounds that he had exceeded his authority. The court's order to cancel the tariffs was swiftly paused, at least for now, by an appeals court. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tracee Ellis Ross, actress and daughter of music icon Diana Ross, is known for her bubbly personality, and seems to keep an optimistic attitude while juggling her responsibilities. "I feel like my natural state is joyful, and yet I work at it," Ross, 52, said during the New York Times Well Festival earlier this month. "I think joy is different from happiness. Prioritizing joyfulness daily is a choice that requires intention, she said. Small moments like making up catchy tunes when she's feeling overwhelmed are what helps her to shift back into a positive state. "I have a group of friends that I have a gratitude and fear list that we write together every morning," she said. Sharing both what she's grateful for and what she's nervous about with her close friends allows Ross to accept that life is a mixed bag of good moments and not-so-great ones. "But if you can mix them in with the right kind of perspective and focus on the stuff that is working, I find that I can have a space of joy in my life," she said. Ross shared an example on how she shifted her perspective when faced with a challenge. The night before the festival she couldn't sleep well and was only able to rest for four and a half hours, despite the eventful day she had planned. On her ride through New York City before arriving at the festival, Ross wrote on her gratitude list that she was grateful for a bright blue sky, career abundance and "spring New York energy."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's something new every day, and it's filled with contradictions. As a psychiatrist on the front lines of healthy youth development, I've worked with over 3,000 young adults. And as a mom of three kids, I've spent two decades on both sides of the journey through parenthood. But parenting doesn't have to be complicated. Here are five simple rules to help you navigate the way-too-much-counterproductive-information age. Evolution didn't prepare you to drive a car or negotiate a mortgage, but it did prepare you to be a parent, much more so than most people realize. This means parenting is an area of adult life where it really is okay to follow a hunch and do what feels right. Think about going outside on a cold day. You just kind of know how to stave off hypothermia even if, like most people, you have never experienced it. Parenting is much closer to intuitively bundling up on a cold day than it is to signing your first mortgage. It's okay to trust your instincts, although they're not going to prepare you for every little thing. Any culture that has survived more than a couple of hundred years has robust child-rearing traditions. And any enduring culture has answers for parents — traditions around feeding, rest, socialization, purpose and the transition to adulthood. Now, you probably don't think of your own cultural heritage in this way, you probably just think about it as whatever old-fashioned stuff your parents did. Older siblings, cousins, aunts and uncles are also great. Pediatricians often recommend singing classes because many kids enjoy singing, and there is evidence that it's good for language development. But if you take kid who loves trucks to a singing class, you might make a lot of people unhappy, starting with yourself and your kid. Do you know what else is good for language development? Spending half the day watching a construction site! Many construction vehicles have names that are long and difficult to pronounce, but a kid who likes heavy machinery will outstrip your truck vocabulary in a week or two. You'll find yourself wondering why you have never contemplated questions like: What's the difference between a backhoe and an excavator? You're raising a kid, not a spreadsheet, so leave the developmental tables to the teachers and pediatricians. That stuff is important for screening purposes, but can cause a lot of unnecessary anxiety. If they don't seem okay, consult with your child's pediatrician or teacher, depending on the issue. But many parents could benefit from dialing up the joy and dialing down the obsessing. They learn best when they are happy and relaxed, and engaged in playful activities with people who care about them. Parents tie themselves in knots trying to be perfect. It's okay to show a range of emotions, as long as you don't lose control. This is how children learn that emotions are normal, and to manage their own. Kids are constantly bathed in emotions, and emotional modulation is one of their most important developmental tasks. Worried parents tend to think our times present a unique set of challenges for raising kids, which is true. But it's also true that every generation of parents since time immemorial has had the same worry, and they got through.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran carried out secret nuclear activities with material not declared to the U.N. nuclear watchdog at three locations that have long been under investigation, the watchdog said in a wide-ranging, confidential report to member states seen by Reuters. It would be the first time in almost 20 years Iran has formally been found in non-compliance. Tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and has long denied accusations by Western powers that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons. While many of the findings relate to activities dating back decades and have been made before, the IAEA report's conclusions were more definitive. It summarized developments in recent years and pointed more clearly towards coordinated, secret activities, some of which were relevant to producing nuclear weapons. It also spelled out that Iran's cooperation with IAEA continues to be "less than satisfactory" in "a number of respects." The IAEA is still seeking explanations for uranium traces found years ago at two of four sites it has been investigating. The IAEA has concluded that "these three locations, and other possible related locations, were part of an undeclared structured nuclear programme carried out by Iran until the early 2000s and that some activities used undeclared nuclear material", the report said. Nuclear material and/or heavily contaminated equipment from that program was stored at the fourth site, Turquzabad, between 2009 and 2018, it said. "The Agency concludes that Iran did not declare nuclear material and nuclear-related activities at three undeclared locations in Iran, specifically, Lavisan-Shian, Varamin, and Turquzabad," the report said. At Lavisan-Shian in Tehran, a disc made of uranium metal was "used in the production of explosively-driven neutron sources" at least twice in 2003, a process designed to initiate the explosion in a nuclear weapon, the report said, adding that it was part of "small-scale" tests. The report is likely to lead to Iran being referred to the U.N. Security Council, though that would probably happen at a later IAEA board meeting, diplomats said. More immediately, it is likely to lead to Iran again accelerating or expanding its rapidly advancing nuclear programme, as it has done after previous rebukes at the board. It could also further complicate talks with the United States aimed at reining in that program. That is enough, if enriched further, for nine nuclear weapons, according to an IAEA yardstick. Both IAEA reports said enrichment to such a high level was "of serious concern" since it is the only country to do so without producing nuclear weapons. Israel, which has long urged strong action against Iran's nuclear programme, said the IAEA report showed Tehran was determined to complete its nuclear weapons programme. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the world should act now to stop Iran from doing this. U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA have long believed Iran had a secret, coordinated nuclear weapons programme that it halted in 2003.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It offers access to a variety of transportation options through its platform and mobile-based applications. The Lyft Platform provides a marketplace where drivers can be matched with riders via the Lyft App, where it operates as a transportation network company. Transportation options through its platform and mobile-based applications are substantially comprised of its ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders in cities across the United States and in certain cities in Canada, Lyft's network of bikes and scooters, and the Express Drive program, where drivers can enter into short-term rental agreements with its subsidiary, Flexdrive Services, LLC or a third party for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft Platform. It makes the ridesharing marketplace available to organizations through Lyft Business offerings, such as the Concierge and Lyft Pass programs. Activist Commentary: Engine Capital is an experienced activist investor led by Managing Partner Arnaud Ajdler, former partner and senior managing director at Crescendo Partners. Engine's history is to send letters and/or nominate directors but settle rather quickly. On March 25, Engine announced a position in Lyft and stated that they are calling for a strategic review, improved capital allocations and the elimination of the company's dual-class share structure. Since David Risher took control as CEO of Lyft in 2023, Lyft has made some major improvements, streamlining operations, enhancing platform functionality, and expanding market presence. These have led to notable material enhancements in the company's operational and financial performance. Despite these improvements, Lyft's share price decreased by 30% over the same period. There are a few factors that may help explain the company's current undervaluation. The company is in an inherently difficult strategic position due to Uber's dominance — while Lyft is only in the US and Canada, Uber is diversified across most global markets and has expanded into other synergetic areas like food and alcohol delivery. This makes Lyft particularly vulnerable to Uber's decisions regarding pricing and promotions, as management noted during the company's most recent earnings call. The market has sensed this situation, with Lyft's shares underperforming compared to Uber by 37%, 287%, and 210% over the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, respectively. Second to this is Lyft's suboptimal capital allocation practices. Currently, dilution is primarily caused by the company's stock-based compensation (SBC) practices, which are currently around $330 million annually, 4.9% of Lyft's market cap. Enter Engine, who is calling for a strategic review, improved capital allocation practices and the elimination of the company's dual-class share structure. As has been already discussed, one of, if not the largest challenge Lyft faces is their inability to scale and diversify at the pace of Uber. Large players in the food delivery or automotive industry make sense as potential acquirers. For example, Doordash, with a roughly $80 billion market cap, could easily afford Lyft, has synergies to better optimize both platforms, a global presence, and would create more revenue stream options for drivers. Given Lyft's depressed valuation (EV to 2026 consensus EBITDA multiple of approximately 6.6x), recent growth, and large number of potential synergies, a large takeout premium is certainly possible here. Secondly, the company clearly needs to improve its capital allocation practices. While Lyft recently announced a $500 million buyback program, this is not even sufficient to counter the dilution over the next two years due to current SBC practices. With $2 billion of cash (approximately $700 million of net cash) and the company dramatically increasing their FCF, it appears that Lyft has the ability to much more aggressively repurchase shares to do more than just counter SBC dilution. Lastly, as a corporate governance investor, Engine will propose eliminating the dual-class structure. Originally set up to give control to the founders, this structure now seems unnecessary since co-founders John Zimmer and Logan Green are no longer involved in day-to-day operations. These preferred shares carry 20 votes per share, which give them 30.8% of the total voting power while owning only approximately 2.3% of outstanding shares. However, there is virtually no way that Zimmer and Green will voluntarily give up this control position. As an experienced activist investor Ajdler knows that, but also as an experienced activist investor, he has to try. A refreshment of these directors for people with public market, capital allocation and capital markets expertise, would better position the Company for what it is today. After launching a proxy fight for two board seats, this campaign came to a head when Engine withdrew their director nominations on May 8. This withdrawal came following the company's public announcement to increase its share repurchase authorization to $750 million and commit to utilize $200 million of such authorization over the next three months and $500 million within the next 12 months.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the first several months of President Donald Trump's second term, DOGE seemed like an unstoppable force. Now, political gravity is about to kick in. Though he says he'll still be in Washington here and there, Elon Musk is ending his time as an official White House employee. It all amounts to a new phase for DOGE, one where the swift and disruptive action of Trump's first few months will give way to the delays, gridlock, and possibility of failure that come with trying to pass bills through Congress. The first task for Republicans is passing $9.4 billion in cuts that the White House plans to send to Congress on Tuesday. That so-called "rescission" package, which rescinds funding previously approved by the legislative branch, includes $8.3 billion in cuts to foreign aid and $1.1 billion in cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the government-backed entity that funds NPR and PBS. Republicans have been clamoring to cut federal funding to NPR and PBS for months, and the House DOGE subcommittee held a hearing on the issue in March. There's also been growing frustration on the right that DOGE cuts haven't come sooner, with some lawmakers arguing that they should be regularly voting to codify spending cuts. All it would take is a handful of Republicans to derail the effort, and when Trump tried to pass a $15 billion recession package in his first term, it failed in the Senate. There's already at least one GOP senator who's likely to vote against it: Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who recently wrote an op-ed opposing cuts to public broadcasting funding. A White House official told BI that the $9.4 billion in cuts — only the second time a president has sent a rescission package to Congress since 2000 — is an indication of the administration's commitment to following through on DOGE's work. House Speaker Mike Johnson said as much in a post on X on Wednesday, adding that the House is "eager and ready to act on DOGE's findings so we can deliver even more cuts to big government." That will be even harder than passing stand-alone DOGE cuts. While rescission packages only require a simple majority in both chambers to pass, government funding is generally a bipartisan process — one that Democrats have the power to block entirely in the Senate via the 60-vote filibuster rule. That led to intense backlash from the Democratic base, which has helped fuel primary challenges and calls for generational change. It's unclear that enough Democrats will be willing to do the same thing again in September. Meanwhile, Republicans are making their own job harder with their "Big Beautiful Bill," a sprawling piece of legislation that, in its current form, would increase the deficit by trillions of dollars over the next decade. Musk made his dissatisfaction with that bill clear in a recent interview, saying it "undermines" the work that DOGE has been doing by increasing the deficit and debt. 'I don't know if it could be both."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We've rounded up everything you need to know about how to watch a French Open live stream, including multiple free options. Keep reading to learn about viewing options from around the globe. Even seasoned tennis fans should take notice, as some countries have changed channels from last year. The free options highlighted below will require a VPN to watch from outside their broadcast country, but we can show you how to do this further down the page. Want to access those free options but aren't actually in France or Australia? You can still tune in with the help of a VPN. Short for virtual private networks, VPNs are cybersecurity tools that enable you to change your electronic device's virtual location. They're popular apps among those looking to access their usual websites and services while traveling abroad or upgrade their online security. ProtonVPN is a great place to start, thanks in no small part to its impressive security features and 30-day money-back guarantee. Some Australian coverage is limited to replays, but they'll get more live matches the deeper we get into the competition. Need a low-cost VPN packed with useful features and servers in 110+ countries? If you only want a rolling one-month deal, Proton is much cheaper than the competition at $9.99. All plans can be used across 10 devices at once and feature a great ad-blocker, split tunneling, and more security-conscious features. American cord-cutters have a few options to explore when tuning in without cable. You can live stream the channels through a live TV streaming service like Sling TV or DirecTV, or try out Max. Subscriptions start at $46/month, but new users can get 50% off their first month. DirecTV also carries TNT and about 25 other key sports channels in its MySports pack. The package also includes automatic access to ESPN Plus. New members often get a chunky discount on their first month. This add-on is only available with ad-free plans, which start at $17/month. Ad-free Disney Plus, Hulu, and Max are available for $30/month. The streaming options also look a bit different for UK viewers this year. Instead of Eurosport, the TNT Sports coverage will be available to live stream through Discovery Plus. The Premium tier, which costs £31/month, is required to watch TNT. This option offers live streaming for several sports, including motorsport, Champions League, and UFC. In Australia, the French Open will be available through 9Now. The start of the tournament should air live on 9's Gem channel, and viewers can live stream coverage for free through 9Now. Users just need to create a free account if they don't already have one, and then they're all set to start watching. The service has a free live streaming counterpart, France.TV, which just requires account creation to use. The streamer sometimes prioritizes French contestants if there are multiple matches on. So far, though, we've seen an excellent selection of simultaneous coverage with no gaps for the big players and many lesser-known ones, making it our top pick of all the options. Note: The use of VPNs is illegal in certain countries and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal use of VPNs. We highlight products and services you might find interesting.
