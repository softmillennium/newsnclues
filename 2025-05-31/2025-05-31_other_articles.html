                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Aria” by Michael Ballard (independently published). Okay, poet Michael Ballard hooked this reader at his back-cover, self-generated blurbs: They're blurbs as if written by Walt Whitman (… “do not stand idly by for word of mouth, do not accept the tepid reviews of stodgy critics”), by Emily Dickinson (… “am happy to report I did experience a pleasant chill”), and by Billy Collins (“good luck, all the same”). This collection is serious enough but refreshingly witty. Ballard, who wrote “on and off most of his adult life,” only turned to poetry at age 66. Fortunately, Ballard's death-awareness often highlights the pleasures of living. Topics are everyday — grocery shopping, dental appointments — but Ballard punches the unusual into them — “geezer Wednesdays” eliminate the shopper's need to make choices; the dentist's “hm” sets off speculation on why that ubiquitous sound hasn't made its way into the dictionary. The poems' real pleasure often comes with Ballard's final line, as in this reflection on the glory of the night sky: “…the cosmos will never/ be able to treasure its own terrifying/ beauty. “It should thank its lucky stars.” “I, Ghost: A Paranormal Autobiography” by R.L. R. L. Clayton addresses his audience directly in the opening of this book. “I, Ghost” opens with the first-person character in the middle of a series of tortures. His torturer steps out, and his son — against explicit orders — picks up the controls, ratchets up the power, and kills our character. As he dies, he sees below him the two torturers — father Leon and 17-year-old Jon — and is overcome with a desire for revenge. He can't let it go. He then finds himself in an afterlife full of souls like his — dead but tied somehow to the world of the living. A single notion seems to keep them linked. There is no joy in this dimension. The story is that our character has been part of a biomedical experiment in which criminals can avoid execution by participating in vaccine development. Our character discovers he can invade the minds and dreams of living souls, which comes in handy when an insidious international threat arises. “Urban Trails Tucson” by Sirena Rana (Mountaineers Books). This handsome pack-sized guidebook is a must-have for hiking in the Tucson area. It includes 65 color photos, 43 maps, plant and animal guides, cultural background, geographic notes, trail descriptions and key trail details such as distance, elevation gain, difficulty, fitness suitability, family- and dog-friendliness, amenities, etc. Author Sirena Rana, founder of Trails Inspire, proves an engaging guide as she weaves personal anecdotes in the entries featuring 47 trails of varying levels of difficulty in and around Tucson. “War for the Stars: End of Earth, Book 3” by Matt Simons (Independently published). Tucsonan Matt Simons says the story that has become his “End of the Earth” series came to him when he was a kid. In this, Book 3, Earth is threatened by an interstellar alien species that has already conquered much of the galaxy. Thanks to the knowledge, Jason Baker passed to a friend in Book 2 — before he was flung back in time by a WW III nuclear blast — the U.S. has perfected a secret means to open corridors through space. Using that technology, Earth forces, led by four physically enhanced modern men and one 13,000-year-old one, will go to interstellar war. You will like seeing Jason again, even though he's cast back in time to his pre-war innocence, and it's painful for him to be with the friends who would die before his eyes. At the close of this volume, Simons invites readers to join him “as we slowly close in on The End of Earth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A scientist has issued an ominous message to humanity after a UFO covered in unexplained and weird writing was discovered - potentially changing the future of our knowledge of aliens. Specifically, the discovery of an unusual, sphere-shaped object found in Columbia that scientists believe could be a piece of UFO technology. The object displays symbols akin to ancient scripts like runes and scientists have used AI to try to help decipher the strange text, with Dr Mossbridge telling Fox News: "We are entering a time when we are starting to recognize as humans we don't have the control that we thought we had over everything." "One of the mistakes we make is [saying] because I think I understand this, everything I think today is true," she said, adding that it makes people confused when something shows up that doesn't "fit our model of the world." "The sphere itself seems kind of like an art project," she added. Well, I think it's partly the same reason. And there's something going on that's essentially bigger than us." On the other hand, Dr Jose Luis Velazquez, a radiologist who examined the sphere said he found no clues that would typically be found on the sphere had humans made it. More testing is needed to establish its origin," he said. Mail Online reports that his team of researchers used AI to assist in deciphering the design and found it to read: "The origin of birth through union and energy in the cycle of transformation, meeting point of unity, expansion, and consciousness — individual consciousness." They said: "We interpret it as a message to humanity, encouraging a collective shift in consciousness to help Mother Earth—especially considering the current issues with pollution and environmental decline." In similar circumstances, a set of three-fingered alien mummies have been baffling scientists since they were discovered in 2017 in the Nazca desert and now scientists say they are 1,200 years old. Also at times dismissed as merely an art project, the ‘alien' mummies of Peru may have actually been murdered, experts believe. Scientists examining the mysterious three-fingered bodies with elongated skulls have made new findings they claim prove the specimens are ‘100% real'. Discovered in 2017 in Peru's Nazca desert the mummies were presented to the world in Mexico two years ago as possible fossilised remains of extraterrestrials who were not part of Earth's evolutionary chain. Initial DNA analysis showed they were part-human and part 'unknown species', prompting Mexico's first congressional hearing on UFOs. Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The doll's famous history began in 1970 after it had been gifted to a Hartford nurse and then began moving on her own and, in one instance, allegedly attacked the owner's fiancé. Lorraine and Ed Warren, renowned paranormal researchers and founders of Warren's Occult Museum, investigated the doll's paranormal activity and gave her a permanent spot in their museum. She was displayed in a protective case, fitted with carved prayers and crosses as well as a sign made by Ed Warren, which read, 'Warning: Positively Do Not Open.' The Warrens had always warned about moving Annabelle but for those who took the doll on tour they vehemently defended doing so and say it is what the Warrens would have wanted. NESPR Lead Investigator into the paranormal, Chris Gilloren, who was part of the tour team, told DailyMail.com: '[Annabelle's] not a spectacle, but it's a great way to get people talking about evil. That's what Ed and Lorraine wanted to do. Ryan Buell, a paranormal investigator who also joined the tour, agreed that it was about education and continuing to spread the work of Ed and Lorraine Warren. Annabelle just completed her tour across the US with the New England Society for Psychic Research, making stops in West Virginia, Louisiana and Texas, but what followed her were a series of unfortunate events that the public linked to the haunted doll Paranormal investigator Ryan Buell (left) and NESPR Lead Investigator Chris Gilloren joined Annabelle on the tour but pinned the unfortunate happenings as purely a 'coincidence' Pictured: Ryan Buell and Wade Kirby outside of the West Virginia State Penitentiary On May 15, as Annabelle left Louisiana - her second tour stop - the historic 166-year-old Nottoway Plantation was destroyed in a blazing fire That they devoted their lives to this work, that there are people our there who still dedicate their own lives to helping people who are having these experiences,' Buell said. But the tour was not without it's strange and creepy moments that fueled wild online speculation on Annabelle's ability to leave a path of destruction as she moved around the country. On May 15, as Annabelle left Louisiana - her second tour stop - the historic 166-year-old Nottoway Plantation was destroyed in a blazing fire. One post on X connected the dots on May 19 and wrote: 'Three days ago they moved Annabelle, one of the most haunted dolls from Monroe, Connecticut, to New Orleans, Louisiana, and now the largest sugarcane plantation in Louisiana burned down AND 11 inmates in a New Orleans Prison escape...' Annabelle's tour team pictured left to right: Avery Gilloren, Father Bob Bailey, Dan Rivera, Chris Gilloren, Caleb Breece, Ryan Buell, and Wade Kirby Another comment said: 'Taking her down here where there's voodoo and spirits everywhere is actually an idiot move I have to say.' Many other social media users worried about their own cities, and even contacted those monitoring Annabelle. '...the amount of messages, emails that I received through our websites and social medias... they truly believe Annabelle did all this, which makes no sense to me personally... you know, why would she burn it down?' Gilloren said he believed that the events were purely coincidental. Speaking to Buell, DailyMail.com pointed out the route Annabelle took as she left Louisiana. And, yes, it was on the same day. 'So, I mean, yes, that is a very bizarre coincidence.' Yet, Buell said there was an even stranger occurrence before they left New Orleans - a voodoo Priestess who 'challenged' Annabelle. Just days after Annabelle left New Orleans, a group of 'violent' inmates escaped the New Orleans Parish Jail which the public also linked to the haunted doll's nearby presence She laid holy water down and said, 'In the name of New Orleans voodoo, I rebuke you.'... but I mean, there was the thought of, yikes, this priestess just challenged Annabelle,' Buell said 'We were like, 'wait, so we're being blamed for what? Louisiana, okay, well probably coincidence,' But I mean, I kind of thought, well, there was this voodoo priestess who challenged Annabelle when we were leaving,' he recalled. 'We were packing up and all of a sudden we heard tambourines and someone's screaming, 'Go to hell, Annabelle,'' Buell said. 'She laid holy water down and said, 'In the name of New Orleans voodoo, I rebuke you.'... but I mean, there was the thought of, yikes, this priestess just challenged Annabelle. It was almost like voodoo versus the demonic,' he continued. 'And so... there was that creeping thought of, 'what if,'' Buell said. 'To our knowledge, it's the first time we brought Annabelle to another haunted location, especially that far out,' Buell said, of their first tour stop in West Virginia State Penitentiary, a famously haunted building. Buell added that they had psychic mediums with them in the prison who said that other 'spirits' were 'staying at a distance'. Buell recalled how things got 'aggressive' as they used a spirit box to communicate with Annabelle on tour, and said: 'People would ask questions, 'who's here with us? Buell said that he had visited the West Virginia State Penitentiary numerous times before, but that Annabelle's presence had quietened other spirit activity he had experienced before. Pictured: Ryan Buell in front of the WV State Penitentiary While on tour, the team included psychic mediums as well as priests, including Father Bob Bailey who helped bless the team and their equipment for protection against Annabelle's spirit A couple were saying they felt uneasy,' Buell said. 'And the two employees who were there, who regularly witnessed the activity, they pulled me to the side and said, 'look, they don't like it that Annabelle is here. After Annabelle had left, other activity picked up again. Buell recalled his previous experiences at the prison, without Annabelle. That place is so active,' he said. 'You'll literally hear bangings if you say, hey, knock for me. He described his experience within the infirmary as feeling like 'prey'. 'You're very well aware of the fact that you're being watched. You feel like something is literally following you and you start to feel a sense of danger,' he added, recalling that he heard bangs and the slamming of doors around him. 'I started getting really intrusive thoughts, and Wade had to remind me that the demonic often use psychological tactics, so we just doused ourselves in holy water and kept going,' Buell said of their first day with Annabelle. Buell recalled how things got 'aggressive' as they used a spirit box to communicate with the doll, who inspired The Conjuring and Annabelle movie franchises. He said the process involves one person listening with noise cancelling headphones, only able to hear what's going on inside the box, while those outside ask questions. 'It's pulling from like public radio stations, right? It just randomly jumps from station to station and pulls sounds and voices from it,' Buell said. This energy is getting a little too weird. Despite having worked with Annabelle many times before, Buell still found himself sensing a strange energy surrounding the doll. 'In New Orleans, myself and Wade, who is a member of NESPR, were mainly the ones giving the talks about the Warren's... and so we would have to stand in front of Annabelle for hours,' he said. That they devoted their lives to this work, that there are people our there who still dedicate their own lives to helping people who are having these experiences,' Buell said That's what Ed and Lorraine wanted to do. 'I started getting really intrusive thoughts, and Wade had to remind me that the demonic often use psychological tactics, so we just doused ourselves in holy water and kept going,' Buell recalled. 'I mean, she was down in San Antonio and I really haven't heard of anything happening in San Antonio. I haven't heard anything up in West Virginia happening,' Gilloren said. I mean she's been in Connecticut for 50 years. We don't blame every kind of disaster on Annabelle,' he added. By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The video, recorded on April 27 by an anonymous resident in Twentynine Palms, follows a brightly lit hexagonal-shaped object as it flies over the desert. The UFO reportedly appeared out of nowhere at around 22:27 p.m. local time, while the witness was standing in an isolated cabin. "It appeared to move arbitrarily, without any clear direction. The large object also appeared to pulse, emitting bright light from its edges, as it moved across the sky for about 15 minutes. As the witness in Twentynine Palms followed the UFO, he added that the strange object began to change shape – going from a hexagonal object to a circular shape. However, he stated in his report to NUFORC that he had not taken any type of perception-affecting substance during the observation and that he had had clear vision throughout. NUFORC officials attempted to find an explanation for the event, noting that a SpaceX rocket launch had taken place that day, but the Falcon 9 rocket had been launched from Florida three hours earlier. That strange shape, according to experts, was caused by the glowing frozen fuel being released from the SpaceX rocket. The blue spiral is formed when excess fuel released from the rapidly spinning rocket rises, reflecting sunlight into the upper atmosphere – giving it an otherworldly glow – before turning into water vapor. This new sighting occurred just days before a hearing in the US Congress on UFOs and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Speakers, including Pentagon UFO project whistleblower Luis Elizondo, a former NASA administrator and a retired Navy admiral, called on the government to publish what it knows about these unexplained sightings. Elizondo and others pointed out that witnesses like the one in Twentynine Palms have no official central channel in the U.S. to report UFO sightings. NUFORC and the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) are two of the most well-known civilian organizations that keep records of citizen sightings. Although these two organizations are not affiliated with the government, they often share data with researchers or state institutions when important cases occur.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every season of Supernatural built its fan base from small and cult-like to a pop culture icon, with the ending igniting inevitable controversy. Running from 2005 to 2020, the show was led by Jensen Ackles as Dean Winchester and Jared Padalecki as Sam Winchester, and a lot of people didn't want to see it end. Then, in a move that some saw as anticlimactic and others saw as perfectly fitting, Dean eventually died in a run-of-the-mill vampire hunt. But The Winchesters made it clear just how easy this would be. Developed by Robbie Thompson with Ackles serving as executive producer, The Winchesters followed a young John and Mary. However, the spinoff was seemingly deviating from canon, particularly regarding Mary's past and how much she knew about John and the threats their family would face. Sam and Dean Winchester had a jarring ending that took many by surprise. Fortunately, despite its flaws, The Winchesters provided some more closure to it. Elaborating on Dean's time in heaven, The Winchesters confirmed that Dean was still saving the world, even after his death. This made his death easier to handle and opened up the possibility of a comeback. The Winchesters paraded as a prequel story, but in reality, it was a Supernatural epilogue, and its handling of Dean Winchester's story proves how easily the franchise could return. Eric Kripke has said that he won't bring Supernatural back unless he has a good story for it (Collider). The show may have been canceled for various reasons, but one thing it did well was establish a foundation for the Winchesters in a Supernatural season 16 or reboot. Dean Winchester was killed in the controversial Supernatural series finale, but the franchise gave him a more fitting epilogue two years later. Supernatural writer and producer Robbie Thompson and Supernatural star Jensen Ackles were well-situated to build on the original show for a new series. They did so well, despite whatever problems The Winchesters may have had. A new season, movie, or reboot of Supernatural can explore the multiverse and what Sam, Dean, and Bobby got up to in heaven. The Winchesters is just one of many examples of how death is not really an ending in Supernatural, and how, if there were to be a new season, Sam and Dean could easily return. Created by Eric Kripke, Supernatural is a fantasy/drama series that premiered in 2005. The series follows the adventures of Dean and Sam Winchester - two men wronged by supernatural beings as children who now spend their days investigating and hunting demons, ghosts, and monsters across the United States. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. A satisfactory sci-fi ending is hard to come by these days, which makes HBO's single-season post apocalyptic epic such a treat for audiences. The Last of Us's finale episode saw Ellie continue her search for Abby, but she briefly ran afoul of the Seraphite group and was almost killed. Scarlett Johansson's time as Black Widow in the MCU may be done, but her return to the franchise could still be possible in a behind-the-scenes role. Mary makes a heartwarming decision in Georgie & Mandy's First Marriage season 1 finale, but it comes with a blatant lie that ties to her TBBT future. Star Wars has an easy way to finally bring together two of its best C-3PO and R2-D2 replacements, finally bringing together two fan-favorite droids. Marvel hasn't brought back Oscar Isaac's Moon Knight since his MCU debut even though the character's comic book legacy is an untapped goldmine.</p>

Where it lives: Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam What it eats: Moths, beetles and other flying insects With its large, forward-facing eyes and head tufts that look like ears, the great eared nightjar resembles a dragon more than a bird. Often nicknamed the "baby dragon," this otherworldly-looking creature has several distinctive traits, including an eerie, haunting call. Great eared nightjars, which reach between 12 and 16 inches (30 to 40 centimeters) in length, live in dense, low-lying woodlands across South and Southeast Asia. These elusive, nocturnal birds are masters of camouflage and blend into the forest floor, thanks to their mottled brown, gray and black plumage. By day, they remain motionless among leaf litter or tree stumps, with their coloring protecting them from predators. While the exact reason they avoid nesting in trees like many other birds remains uncertain, it's likely that their natural camouflage offers effective protection for both egg and chick against predators. Their habitat is often dense with vegetation and trees, making it difficult for predators to find the birds and their eggs. —Dracula parrot: The goth bird whose piercing screams echo through New Guinea forests —Turkey vulture: The bird that vomits acid up to 10 feet and poops antiseptic onto its legs Despite their dragon-like appearance, great eared nightjars feed primarily on moths and other flying insects, which they catch mid-air in the twilight hours using their wide, gaping mouths.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, it could be heading for Enceladus instead. NASA's originally planned lander to Europa was cancelled in 2023, but the technology behind it could be used to explore Enceladus instead, the organization has announced. Called the Europa Clipper, it was initially scheduled to arrive at Europa in 2030, and despite successful testing of a prototype, Europa was deemed too hostile for mission success. Well, Europa (a moon of Jupiter) and Enceladus (a moon of Saturn) both have subsurface oceans beneath their icy crusts. These oceans might harbor life, making them two of the most promising places to look for extraterrestrial life in our solar system. NASA's Europa Clipper mission, should it have gone ahead, would have gathered data about Europa's potential habitability. The original plan was that if the Clipper found good evidence (such as signs of water chemistry suitable for life), then a robotic lander might be sent to search for biosignatures. Or, in other words, signs of life. There would also be limited communication time due to Europa's orbit, less than half of each 85-hour day. Yet despite the challenges, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) built a prototype robot to prepare for a possible Europa landing. This lander features legs that enable it to land and operate on Europa's icy surface safely. It also features a stereoscopic camera with lights to enable “see” and navigation, as well as a special drill arm equipped with sensors to prevent breakage. One of its primary tools is the so-called “ICEPICK” tool, which allows for the collection of samples up to 7.87 inches (20 cm) deep. The lander also features autonomous software to help it decide what to do with limited power and time, as well as control individual movements and operations. It passed rigorous field tests on Alaska's Matanuska Glacier (which has harsh, icy terrain similar to Europa). In 2023, the new planetary science decadal strategy (which sets NASA's 10-year priorities) did not recommend the Europa lander. Europa's radiation made it unlikely that biosignatures could survive long enough to be detectable on the surface. This moon of Jupiter has less radiation than Europa and potentially has water plumes that contain molecules needed for life. For these reasons, its surface might preserve biosignatures longer. To this end, much of the robot design and lessons learned from Europa tests can be reused for a mission to Enceladus. The dream of exploring Europa's deep ocean with a submersible still lives, but it's a giant technological leap. Since then, he has worked exclusively within the Built Environment, Occupational Health and Safety and Environmental Consultancy industries.

Speaking with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson on Wednesday, Johnson, R-Oshkosh, said his interest in the attack on New York City, particularly regarding Building 7, a 47-story office building that fell several hours after planes were flown into the nearby Twin Towers, is “because the 9/11 families want to know the answer.” “Building number 7 — you see it come down — and we've all watched, because it's cool to watch these buildings being demolished, boom, just freefall,” Johnson said. You blow them all out so a building can really free-fall. The National Institute of Standards and Testing concluded that uncontrolled fires caused by debris from one of the center's Twin Towers caused steel beams and girders to expand, “leading to a chain of events that caused a key structural column to fail. Speaking with conservative radio host Meg Ellefson a day later, Johnson again cited the 2020 film “Calling Out Bravo 7,” a production he's referenced in the past that questions the official story behind the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 in New York. “And as we find out, in so many different instances, you really can't trust the government what they told you,” Johnson said. “I mean, the government has just repeatedly lied to the American public for decades on so many different issues. In a statement, Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokesperson Phil Shulman criticized Johnson's remarks. “Almost 3,000 Americans died in the 9/11 attacks — and Ron Johnson thinks it's ‘cool' to watch buildings collapse as a result of the worst terrorist attack on American soil,” Shulman said. “It seems Ron Johnson could not care less about the devastation these attacks caused on our country.” "I mean, the government has just repeatedly lied to the American public for decades on so many different issues.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And it didn't take long for it to live up to the billing: Aaron Judge went yard in the game's second at-bat. And then, not to be outdone, Shohei Ohtani followed suit on the very first pitch of the bottom half. The sport's two best hitters, both going deep before everyone had even gotten to their seats. But that was just the beginning of the fireworks: There were five homers just in the first three innings of this game, with Austin Wells, Trent Grisham and Paul Goldschmidt all going yard to help New York build an early 5-2 lead. Rob Manfred himself could hardly have written a more perfect opening script for the most significant game of the year. In fact, maybe the script was a little too perfect — and baseball fans couldn't help but take notice. Allegations that MLB was "juicing" its baseballs in order to increase offense first picked up steam in the late 2010s, amid a resurgence in home runs around the league. Manfred himself more or less confirmed the theory at the 2019 All-Star Game, admitting that "our scientists that have been now studying the baseball more regularly have told us that this year the baseball has a little less drag." As the years went by and MLB revamped its production process and the pendulum swung back in favor of pitchers, the fervor all but died away. But all it took was a rash of suspiciously effortless homers between the league's two richest franchises in order to make everybody a believer again. Is it likely that MLB saw to it that unique balls found their way to Dodger Stadium ahead of this weekend? Then again, when you've already been proven to have tinkered with the baseballs previously — and when a certain kind of baseball already found its way to Judge and the Yankees during his chase for the AL home run record back in 2022 — you've forfeited the benefit of the doubt. This is a perception problem more than anything. Manfred is a figure that fans have never been able to trust, both because he has a hard time communicating clearly and effectively and also because he has a habit of doing some head-scratching stuff. Overall, it gives the impression that the league is making things up as they go along and doesn't have any qualms about putting its thumb on the scale. From there, it's only natural for conspiracy theories to take root. The content on this site is for entertainment and educational purposes only.
