Global economic tensions and trade policy uncertainties continue to influence cryptocurrency markets as Bitcoin recovers from a recent correction. 

Despite the pullback, institutional interest remains strong with firms like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and GameStop adding BTC to their corporate treasuries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin, often seen as the leader of the crypto market, has a fully diluted market cap of over $2.2 trillion but only grew by 11.7% this month. The smart contract platform sector, which includes Ethereum, grew by just 8.1%, while meme coins and DeFi tokens saw gains of 8.2% and 13.5%, respectively. AI tokens, another popular category, rose by 14%, but that's still well behind Ether's performance. Merlin The Trader's post suggests that while many investors might be overlooking Ethereum, smart money (experienced or institutional investors) is rotating into this ecosystem. This could be due to Ethereum's role as a foundation for many decentralized applications, like those in DeFi or gaming, which rely on its blockchain for secure and transparent transactions. The blockchain's ability to support smart contracts makes it a go-to platform for developers building new projects. This ecosystem's recent surge highlights that it's not just Bitcoin that can drive the market, other ecosystems can take the lead too.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum is on the spotlight again this week. SharpLink Gaming, a US-based sports betting firm, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer up to $1 billion in common stock. This big move comes just days after SharpLink announced its new Ethereum-based treasury strategy. Their stock price exploded by nearly 400% during trading on May 27, just after the plan went public. According to the May 30 SEC filing, SharpLink wants to put most of the raised funds toward buying Ether. Some of the cash will also go toward running the business—things like working capital, corporate expenses, and affiliate marketing operations. ETH was trading at $2,520 at the time of the filing, down 2.31% in 24 hours, based on Coingecko data. The company also listed several risks that could affect its big Ether investment. If CBDCs take off, SharpLink believes demand for private cryptocurrencies like ETH could drop or lose their usefulness. If the SEC or another agency decides to classify Ether as a “security,” SharpLink could face new rules and reporting requirements. The crypto community didn't stay quiet. Many compared SharpLink's move to what Strategy did with Bitcoin. Crypto analyst 0xBoboShanti posted on X (formerly Twitter), “Ethereum finally has its own Saylor,” referring to Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). His firm now owns over 580,250 BTC, valued at more than $60 billion, based on Saylor Tracker. Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano added to the noise, saying, “You are not bullish enough,” signaling strong support for SharpLink's strategy. Just before SharpLink's filing, ETF provider REX Shares submitted paperwork that has analysts predicting Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs could launch in the US soon. These ETFs would allow investors to earn staking rewards through regulated funds, something many providers have struggled to pull off. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The offering, announced Friday in a securities filing, consists of an initial issuance of 17 million common shares, with the possibility of expanding to 51 million depending on demand. Shares will be sold exclusively to professional investors in Brazil and abroad under automatic registration rules. Each share purchased will come with a package of free subscription warrants divided into 10 series, allowing investors to buy additional stock at set prices in the future. At current share prices, Méliuz expects to raise around $26 million, but that figure could triple if overallotment options are exercised. Investors participating in the offering will also receive 50.6 million warrants, of which up to 152 million will be issued in total under maximum subscription conditions. Méliuz will use the raised funds to acquire BTC, positioning it as a "primary strategic asset" in its treasury. The firm, known for its cashback and financial services platform, revealed it was allocating 10% of its cash reserves to BTC back in March. Warrant trading is expected to begin on June 16, with share settlement and crediting of the bonus instruments by June 18. Its shares dropped more than 8% in Friday's trading session.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The sale, whose financial terms have not been made public, is Yuga's third IP transaction of 2022. Earlier this year, Yuga sold the intellectual property rights for Meebits and CryptoPunks, which represents a significant shift away from diversifying within NFTs. Originally acquired by Yuga Labs in early 2024 as part of a broader purchase of creator Proof, the Moonbirds IP was once a flagship project within the Ethereum NFT space. However, with Yuga now doubling down on its core initiatives, most notably the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem and its metaverse project, the decision to divest seems in tune with a more focused long-term vision. The studio, known for its hybrid approach to physical and digital experiences, just launched its trading card game based on Pudgy Penguins on the Ethereum layer-2 network. The acquisition of Moonbirds is a sign of increasing ambition to expand its IP portfolio as well as its presence in the NFT-powered gaming space. While Orange Cap hasn't explicitly said what it will do with Moonbirds, the brand assets it may create in the future could run on Ethereum's mainnet or ApeChain, Yuga's affiliated layer-2 network. As Yuga Labs shifts its focus back to its core projects, other companies like Orange Cap Games are taking on the challenge of breathing new life into classic NFT brands.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>'It's for Everyone': With $60 Billion in Bitcoin, Strategy's Michael Saylor Appeals to the Masses Strategy CEO Michael Saylor touted Bitcoin as a virtually foolproof path to wealth creation for “everyone”—from business owners to families, and even one's enemies—in his speech at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas this week. The firm added billions of dollars in Bitcoin to its corporate treasury this month, bringing its total holdings to 580,250 BTC—worth more than $60 billion as of the time of writing, according to data provider CoinGecko. Although speaking before Bitcoiners, the executive stressed that his sales pitch was largely for crypto-curious listeners watching via livestream at home, stressing that Bitcoin is “not [just] for multi-billion-dollar companies.” The Strategy executive also urged his listeners to embrace AI tools, touting their ability to transform the average person into “100 super-geniuses.” Saylor recently shared that Strategy used AI to help craft its unique stock offerings to help power the firm's bountiful Bitcoin buys. Its Bitcoin acquisition spree has inspired a growing number of firms to stockpile the token, with public companies like Metaplanet, Semler Scientific, and most recently GameStop allocating massive amounts of capital to increase their Bitcoin holdings over the past few months. Similarly, institutional investors are also increasingly investing in Bitcoin via exchange-traded funds, pouring billions of dollars into spot Bitcoin ETFs over the past year and a half since their debut in the U.S. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF recorded nearly $6 billion worth of inflows in May once all was said and done, coming close to the monthly record, Farside Investors data shows. Investors' growing appetite for Bitcoin has pushed the token's price to new all-time highs. The asset surpassed $109,000 on May 21 before cresting to nearly $112,000 a day later, although its price has since moderated, sitting just above $104,000 as of this writing. Saylor's speech seemed largely geared towards ensuring Bitcoin would continue its climb to new record highs, bolstered by investments from individuals and institutions across the world. The Strategy founder rounded out his speech by eschewing loftier ideas such as “changing the world” or chasing one's passions as “dilutive distractions,” advising his disciples to narrow their focus to buying Bitcoin if they wanted to get rich. Saylor acknowledged the work of pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto in his advice. “Satoshi gave you an idea worth half of everything on Earth,” Saylor said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TALLINN, Estonia, May  31, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As Phase 5 of its limited presale nears completion, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is gaining momentum for all the right reasons. With its innovative Nova App poised for launch and over $1.2 million raised from 11,000+ participants, the project signals a shift away from short-term hype and toward sustainable, long-term value creation.Bitcoin Solaris: Mining Reimagined for Real People In a world where mining has become elite, expensive, and inaccessible to most, Bitcoin Solaris is changing everything. At the core is the Solaris Nova App—a revolutionary, mobile-first platform designed to make crypto mining available to everyone, regardless of budget, location, or experience. Bitcoin Solaris uses a hybrid Proof-of-Work + Delegated Proof-of-Stake model that processes up to 10,000 transactions per second, with finality in 2 seconds, and uses 99.95% less energy than traditional mining chains. Final Hours of Phase 5: A Critical Entry Point The presale, which ends on July 31, 2025, is entering a key transition. With less than 30 hours before Phase 5 ends, token pricing will move from $5 to $6, continuing toward a public launch price of $20. Investors in this window also receive an 11% token bonus, maximizing early participation benefits before broader exposure. Unlike speculative offerings, Bitcoin Solaris ties its presale directly to the rollout of functional technology. The Nova App—currently in limited beta—is nearing full release, making early access a strategic opportunity rather than a speculative gamble.Why Influencers Are Lining Up to Support It Bitcoin Solaris hasn't just caught the eyes of early users—it's earning praise from trusted voices in the crypto space. This isn't just a flash of attention—it's real validation from those who've seen dozens of projects rise and fall. The team is shipping products, delivering milestones, and building around feedback. The Nova App is nearly ready for full release. Security is confirmed through a full Freshcoins audit and KYC verification. For those seeking a grounded entry into the next era of blockchain mining and crypto income, Bitcoin Solaris is open now—and built for the long game.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>IMF questions Pakistan's plan to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining amid energy shortages and budget talks. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised concerns over Pakistan's decision to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence data centers amid ongoing negotiations tied to the country's extended financial program. The Fund has also voiced concerns over potential impacts on power tariffs and resource distribution. “There is a fear of further tough talks from the IMF on this initiative,” an official involved in the ongoing negotiations reportedly said. The IMF delegation, currently conducting virtual discussions with Pakistani officials, is expected to schedule a separate session dedicated to the government's electricity plan for Bitcoin (BTC) mining and AI operations. The electricity allocation is part of a wider national strategy to integrate digital assets into Pakistan's economy. The development follows Pakistan's high-profile debut of its first strategic Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin Vegas 2025 conference last week — an event signaling Islamabad's pivot toward digital finance. Related: Pakistan appoints special assistant to PM on blockchain and crypto Pakistan's government began shifting its stance on cryptocurrencies earlier this year with the proposal of a “National Crypto Council” in February 2025. The body was tasked with drafting a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets and attracting foreign investment to the country's growing crypto ecosystem. Among the Council's early proposals were plans to utilize surplus energy for Bitcoin mining and data center operations, as well as building a national Bitcoin reserve. Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao was also appointed as an adviser to the Council in April. In this role, he is expected to provide guidance on crypto regulations, blockchain infrastructure, and digital asset adoption.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trading in the mid-$2,000 range, Ethereum (ETH) has repeatedly teased a move toward $3,000, only to fall short and retreat back into its current range. However, several crypto analysts remain confident that ETH's ascent to $3,000 and beyond is only a matter of time. The analyst shared the following daily ETH chart, showing the cryptocurrency breaking out of a bullish flag following a period of consolidation – potentially setting its sights on a target of $3,800. Fellow crypto analyst Master of Crypto shared Titan's outlook, saying that ETH is “holding up really well right now.” In a separate X post, the analyst added: Sharing the following chart of ETH's recent price movement, he emphasized that ETH is behaving as expected as it continues to challenge a key resistance level. According to Jelle, the “real fun” will begin once ETH hits $3,000. Exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows for Ethereum topped $91 million yesterday, with BlackRock alone accounting for $50.4 million of that total – a clear sign of sustained confidence in the digital asset. Seasoned analyst Ali Martinez also highlighted significant whale accumulation. According to Martinez, wallets holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 ETH acquired over 1 million ETH in the last 48 hours – a strong signal of long-term bullish sentiment. Large ETH ETF inflows and whale purchases signal rising institutional confidence and aggressive accumulation – trends that often precede bullish price action. From a technical standpoint, Ethereum is showing encouraging signs. In this pattern, the spring phase involves a false breakdown below support to shake out weak hands, followed by a test to confirm waning selling pressure. According to Merlijn, ETH has already completed the spring and test phases and is now poised to enter the jump phase – potentially setting the stage for a move toward a new all-time high (ATH). That said, all eyes are on the FTX creditor payouts expected later today. Experts warn that the massive $5 billion distribution could temporarily dampen ETH's bullish momentum by increasing short-term selling pressure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But while price action appears stable on the surface, onchain data from Binance suggests mounting downside pressure. Several key metrics, as highlighted by CryptoQuant-based onchain analyst BorisVest, are flashing signs of distribution and potential capitulation risk. Conversely, surging exchange reserves imply a readiness to sell, particularly when price rallies coincide with inflows. It shows that traders are opting to capitalize on local highs, suggesting they do not expect a breakout above the $2,700 resistance to hold. The exchange netflow chart further confirms this bearish shift. Over just three trading sessions, Binance has received a combined net inflow of more than 346,000 ETH. This occurred precisely as ETH attempted to rally toward the upper end of its current range. Netflow measures the difference between ETH deposits and withdrawals from an exchange. These large daily inflows, paired with a lack of significant price follow-through, indicate that whales used the recent bounce as an exit. As of late May, the ratio climbed back toward 0.034, up from near-yearly lows in March. More supply moving onto exchanges means greater potential sell pressure in the near term. As this ratio increases while price consolidates or trends higher, it suggests that sellers are becoming more active than buyers. Bulls may interpret stability as strength, but the underlying metrics contradict that view. Finally, the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio reveals a critical dynamic: while ETH saw aggressive market buying during its most recent bounce, it failed to generate momentum. The ratio jumped above 1.0 on several days in late May, signaling that buyers were initiating trades at market price. Ordinarily, such taker activity is bullish—it reflects conviction and urgency from buyers. However, when a surge in market buys fails to push the price higher, it suggests that sellers are using the demand as exit liquidity. This absorption of buying power without upside follow-through typically precedes a breakdown, especially when confirmed by rising exchange reserves and netflows. Ethereum has formed a clear inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart, pointing to a potential breakout toward $4,150 if the neckline at $2,700 is breached. The structure, coupled with a recent golden cross, suggests bullish momentum could build—if confirmed. ETH continues to face rejection near the neckline, and volume remains weak. A decisive close above $2,700 is needed to validate the breakout. Failure to do so risks a drop toward $2,300 or lower, invalidating the bullish setup. So far, ETH has failed to break above this zone. Adding pressure is the 50-week EMA near $2,575, which ETH has not decisively closed above. A rejection from this confluence could trigger a drop to the wedge's lower boundary near $1,975, with extended downside toward the 0.0 Fib level at $1,075. The risk of breakdown remains high unless ETH reclaims $2,575 with strong volume. He provides in-depth market analysis, technical chart patterns, and insights on global economic impacts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US government argues Coinbase user James Harper has no right to block IRS access to his crypto records in Supreme Court filing. In a filing dated May 30, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that Coinbase user James Harper has no Fourth Amendment right to shield his financial records held by the exchange. The government claimed that Harper “voluntarily” shared his data with Coinbase, and that the IRS followed proper legal procedures to obtain it through a judicially approved summons. In response, the agency obtained a so-called “John Doe” summons compelling Coinbase to turn over records on high-volume customers. Harper, who traded Bitcoin on Coinbase during the relevant years, later sued, claiming that the IRS's actions amounted to an unconstitutional search of his personal records. Citing past cases such as United States v. Miller, the government emphasized that individuals have no reasonable expectation of privacy in financial records held by third parties Coinbase. The filing also pointed to Coinbase's own privacy policy, which warned users that information could be shared with law enforcement. Related: Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonator On May 15, Coinbase disclosed a data breach in which attackers bribed customer support staff in India to access sensitive user information. Stolen data included customer names, account balances, and transaction histories. Coinbase confirmed the breach impacted roughly 1% of its monthly transacting users. Among those affected was venture capitalist Roelof Botha, managing partner at Sequoia Capital. Coinbase also faced a wave of lawsuits following the revelation. At least six legal complaints were filed on May 15 and 16, with plaintiffs accusing the exchange of failing to implement adequate security measures and mishandling its response to the breach.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's recent upward trajectory has encountered resistance after reaching a record-breaking peak of over $111,000 last week. Following this new all-time high, Bitcoin has retraced approximately 4% in the past seven days, bringing its current trading price down to $105,485. This represents a daily decline of 1.8%, reflecting cautious market sentiment and potential profit-taking among traders. In light of these recent price movements, a CryptoQuant analyst has been closely observing market dynamics, particularly concerning the launch of the Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). A detailed analysis provided by Joao Wedson, a contributor to CryptoQuant's QuickTake platform, has shed new light on the liquidation trends observed in Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies, also known as altcoins. According to Wedson, Bitcoin liquidations on Binance have predominantly involved short positions, indicating traders who bet against Bitcoin were systematically liquidated during its recent price rise. Specifically, the Cumulative Liquidation Delta (CLD) showed short liquidations surpassing longs by approximately $190 million. This suggests market participants holding bearish positions were compelled to exit as Bitcoin's value surged, pushing the price further upward. During the same period, altcoins faced nearly $1 billion more in long liquidations compared to shorts. This liquidation imbalance indicates that traders betting on a broad altcoin recovery faced substantial losses. BTC's favorable price performance primarily impacted traders with bearish outlooks, forcing the liquidation of short positions and contributing to a bullish market perception. According to Wedson, since December 2024, this liquidation asymmetry has widened considerably, underscoring a shift in market focus. Investors have increasingly viewed BTC as a safer or more reliable bet amidst broader market uncertainty, while altcoins have suffered due to heightened leverage and speculative positioning. Moving forward, the current market conditions suggest that investors may continue to approach Bitcoin with measured optimism while maintaining a cautious stance toward altcoins.</p>

He referred to the U.S. government as a “Leviathan” that is too weak to carry out policies, while simultaneously imposing “things on the American public that they're getting sick of.” Dimon argued that instead, the U.S. needs to celebrate its long-held values. “You know, and you can acknowledge the flaws that we have, which are extraordinary — what we did the Black population for years. “We don't talk that much to each other — deal with our policies — this is the enemy within,” he continued.
