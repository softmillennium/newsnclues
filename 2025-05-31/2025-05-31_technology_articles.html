Working within the limitations of their 3D printer's bed size is both a challenge and part of the norm for many makers. However, Ivan Miranda and John from Proper Printing have created an infinite print bed by turning a treadmill into a working, giant 3D printer. Their creation can print things on a massive scale, and we absolutely love it. His friend John had the same idea, and the two quickly got to work on turning their crazy concept into a tangible reality. The result is this impressive 3D printer that works unlike anything we've ever seen. The 3D printer is a belt printer with all sorts of unique design quirks necessary for a creative project like this. This makes printing massive things with a theoretically infinite bed size possible. Plans are in the works to test the limits of their creation, but so far, we're already impressed. Miranda uploaded a video demonstrating the printer in action. In it, we see the treadmill 3D printer print a 2-meter-long I-beam. This impressive feat took approximately 36 hours to complete, which isn't too bad. The team intends to take things a step further by using the setup to 3D print a kayak. Creating your 3D printer is cool, but there's nothing wrong with buying one to get started.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The photos, which seem to be from a facility in China, show multiple units of the GPU packed in boxes and ready for shipment. To date, Nvidia partners have not announced any blower-style variant of the RTX 5090. A blower-style GPU includes a single fan to draw in air, and hot air is exhausted from the back of the case. This makes it suitable for systems with limited space and servers, workstations, or multi-GPU setups where managing internal heat is important. Unlike open-air cooled GPUs that tend to recirculate warm air inside the case, blower cards can help lower ambient temperatures by removing all the hot air. Last month, a similar-looking blower-style RTX 5090D was spotted on Chinese video platform Bilibili. This new leak, however, feels less official and more like an opportunistic offshoot. The RTX 5090 can draw up to 575W of power, which means a blower cooler may struggle to handle such high thermal output levels without throttling or excessive noise. While that raises doubts about the card's thermal capability, there's a chance that these GPUs are meant for an AI (Artificial Intelligence) training or an enterprise setup. Recently, the U.S. government requested that the Malaysian trade minister tighten security and monitor tech exports to China to crack down on chip smugglers. Nvidia has not commented on the images or confirmed any such SKU in development. Whether they are engineering samples, modified OEM hardware, or originating from unauthorized supply chains, the appearance of such GPUs raises doubts over supply chain security and the growing demand for high-performance GPUs in China.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last week, Google quietly released an app that lets users run a range of openly available AI models from the AI dev platform Hugging Face on their phones. Called Google AI Edge Gallery, the app is available for Android and will soon come to iOS. The models run offline, without needing an internet connection, tapping into supported phones' processors. The home screen shows shortcuts to AI tasks and capabilities like “Ask Image” and “AI Chat.” Tapping on a capability pulls up a list of models suited for the task, such as Google's Gemma 3n. Google AI Edge Gallery also provides a “Prompt Lab” users can use to kick off “single-turn” tasks powered by models, like summarizing and rewriting text. Your mileage may vary in terms of performance, Google warns. Modern devices with more powerful hardware will predictably run models faster, but the model size also matters. The app is under an Apache 2.0 license, meaning it can be used in most contexts — commercial or otherwise — without restriction. Answer a few quick AI trivia questions to start your challenge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Will we get a better gaming experience the second time around? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. If we are to believe a leaked manual for an upcoming Intel W880 motherboard, the Intel Arrow Lake-S processor will seemingly have a refresh successor. Popular hardware leaker momomo_us shared an image of the purported motherboard reference document with the CPU labeled Arrow Lake S/Arrow Lake S Refresh. Previous rumors point to another generation of the Arrow Lake architecture, focusing only on high-end K and KF chips. Unfortunately, we do not see any other information on the document, so we will have to wait and see if manufacturers of more mainstream consumer and enthusiast motherboards will release new models for this alleged Arrow Lake update. Team Blue sorely needed a win to help it get back on course—unfortunately, the Arrow Lake wasn't it, as sales for its latest processor stagnated just a week after its launch. One reason behind this could be the chip's lack of gaming prowess. It has consistently trailed behind AMD's outstanding offerings, especially the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, and was even outperformed by Intel's own last-generation chips. And even though the Arrow Lake processors boast an NPU and offer higher AI processing power, most buyers don't care about that. This, combined with the higher prices, meant that there was low demand for these CPUs. Otherwise, buyers would shun them and instead flock towards options that deliver more FPS and do not bottleneck other components. It has improved power consumption and efficiency, reducing its cooling requirements. It's also a productivity powerhouse, with the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K beating most of its competitors in Cinebench. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta recently released a new video editing app for creators called Edits. Meta first shared that it was working on Edits back in January after ByteDance-owned CapCut was removed from U.S. app stores when the TikTok ban momentarily went into effect. Although the app has since come back online and is available to download, TikTok's future in the U.S. remains uncertain, so Meta is ready to capitalize on CapCut's possible absence in the future with its new Edits app. We've created this guide to walk you through the app and the different features it offers, and we provide an overview of how it compares to CapCut. Edits is available to download on both iOS and Android. From there you will see five main tabs: Ideas, Inspiration, Projects, Record, and Insights. The Ideas tab offers creators a space to jot down ideas for new videos and save reels to a collection, and the Inspiration tab features a hub for discovering trending audios and other popular reels. This tab is also where creators can upload videos from their phone's camera roll. The Record tab lets creators start filming video content right within Edits. Lastly, the Insights tab gives creators an overview of how their content is performing by surfacing metrics like views, reach, and follower counts. Green screen: Replace and edit the background of your videos with one tap. Timeline frame rate selector: Convert your video to the frame rate you want in order to enhance playback smoothness. Alignment guides: Ensure viewers can see the important parts of your video when posted and accurately position text, emoji, or other elements. CapCut offers more robust editing options, including AI features, than Edits does. Of course, this can be expected since Edits is a lot newer than CapCut. Meta will likely continue to build out Edits over the next months and years, so we can expect to see more advanced functionality in the future. It's also worth noting that CapCut has a more extensive music library compared to Edits. Edits is free to use, but this will likely change in the future, as Instagram head Adam Mosseri has stated that later versions of Edits may include paid features.

Last month, Intel launched new power-optimized drivers for handheld devices, touting performance gains across various titles. With the latest Arc graphics driver version 32.0.101.6874, Intel is expanding these optimizations to all Core Ultra 200V-powered devices, across laptops and mini-PCs. Since Intel's Arc is still in its early stages, many initial launches have improved with age due to subsequent driver improvements. Furthermore, despite Battlemage offering a relatively stronger and more stable platform at launch, it's clear there is still untapped potential, as shown by these software-driven improvements. Intel's Arc graphics driver 32.0.101.6734 introduced notable low-power mode optimizations for Lunar Lake-powered handhelds, specifically the MSI Claw 8 AI+. After extensive validation and testing, Intel is expanding the scope of these optimizations to all devices, whether laptops or mini-PCs. First-party metrics suggest a 10% bump in performance across the board in nine titles, with the Core Ultra 7 258V at 17W, but your mileage will vary. We'll have to verify these claims through independent testing. The new drivers also address a slew of bugs across various productivity applications and games. A noteworthy detail in the patch notes is the increased memory allocation for integrated Arc GPUs across Core Ultra Series 1 (Meteor Lake) and Series 2 (Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake) product lines, now supporting up to 57% compared to the previous 50% cap. Most software divisions are likely hard at work preparing the groundwork for next-generation Celestial (Xe3) graphics, set to be introduced with Panther Lake early next year.

Whether you're relaxing on a beach, chilling at a campsite or kicking back by a pool, surrounding yourself with good tunes will elevate any situation and you will be happy you had the chance to enjoy it. Amazon is running a deal where it has marked down the popular and iconic Beats Pill portable Bluetooth speaker to an all -time low, clearing out inventory just in time for summer. Right now, you can get this popular speaker for just $99, which is $50 cheaper than the original list price of $149. The Pill can deliver deep and powerful sound and a room filled with sound thanks to a larger, custom racetrack woofer that displaces 90% more air volume than previous iterations. The tweeter has also been redesigned for some extra stability for those nice crisp highs and rich mid-range tones, while the new woofer material and structure makes it easier to reduce low-end distortion even at reasonable volumes. No matter where you listen, it is dynamic and crystal clear. Plus, if your phone or other device needs a charge, the Pill can charge those devices via USB-C cable and save you from running out of power.

So when I heard about the Nike x Hyperice collaboration to develop a shoe with compression and heating capabilities built in, I was eager to learn more. The only downside to the Normatec boots are the fact that you have to chill out and remain horizontal while you wear them (which, maybe isn't exactly a downside, but it still means you can't multitask much during your recovery period). With the Hyperboots, you can enjoy the same squeezing and releasing sensation around your feet and ankles while you go about your life. There's something very exciting about a shoe with extras built in. I got small Hyperboots (they come in small, medium, large, XL, and XXL) and they were too big for my size-8 feet, but turning on the shoe made comfortable enough to walk around in them without my foot slipping around. From there, you have the option to adjust the level of compression and heat, with three settings each, and you can press a play button to start an active air-compression massage. The boots sync settings when you have them both on. The air filling up the ankle wrap and releasing does make a droning noise, almost like an airplane flying overhead—nothing too obnoxious. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I noticed the plush foam soles and their rocker bottoms, which helped propel me forward with little effort. The shoes don't offer much in terms of arch support, so I wouldn't recommend walking far in them if you have high, fussy arches like me (without adding some inserts), but they were comfortable enough all the times I wore them. The upper feels extremely durable, and even with the built-in tech, they can handle splashes and rain (though they aren't fully waterproof). I liked the highest compression setting for my feet, but that setting felt like a bit much around my ankles when I was walking. The top of the ankle wrap dug in a bit when I moved, but it wasn't uncomfortable if I was sitting. The massage runs for 20 minutes, and you can just press play again to start over if your dogs need some more TLC. After trying the shoes around the house, I was excited to use them after an activity that was harder on my feet. I put them on after a long day snowboarding where I racked up over 13,000 feet of vert, and I was able to drive home through the mountains while my feet warmed up and got a relaxing massage—incredible. The boots flushed out the lactic acid that had built up in my feet and ankles from all the maneuvering they were doing inside my bindings, and I was able to keep the massage going after I got home and while I did laundry and dishes. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Usually when I go to bed after a day on the mountain, my legs ache and it can make it hard to fall asleep. As someone with plantar fasciitis, that's where I really need it. The air-compression doesn't feel like a real massage. It's still wonderful and great for increasing blood flow and expediting recovery, but even the highest compression setting couldn't apply as much pressure to my feet as I'd personally prefer. It would also be amazing if the shoes could provide cooling or icing as well. When I wore these after a handful of runs, they absolutely made my feet feel better and sped up my recovery, but for how much they cost, I wanted more. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I'm about to head out on a long weekend road trip that, if all goes to plan, will have me hiking four days in a row. And the one good thing about them running a bit big and being able to somewhat conform to your feet? I can share them with my buddies after our biggest adventures. Another cool aspect of the Hyperboots is the fact that you can wear them while you warm up for a sport, using the heat and compression to relax and knead your muscles into a flexible, less injury-prone state. I tried this a few times pre-run, and while I enjoyed the feeling and noticed a slight benefit (feeling more warmed up for my run with less effort), I definitely enjoy them more for post-workout recovery. They don't fit me very well, so I couldn't wear them for a whole dynamic warm-up with track drills, though they worked fine for walking around the house before I changed into my running shoes. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I wish they came in more sizes so I could get a better fit, and likely, an even better massage. With the chunky heels extending far past my ankle, they also look a bit ridiculous. Not that that really matters, but I'd be more inclined to wear them around in the real world if I could get a slightly smaller size. When people with bigger feet wear them, I think they look cool. For the average person, these probably won't lead to a huge shift in how you train or race or play your sport of choice, but they certainly won't hurt. If being able to take care of your feet without slowing down is a priority, the Hyperboots could be worth it. Either way, I'm excited to see what Nike and Hyperice do with future iterations. The Hyperboots are just one aspect of a really cool and innovative sector of the recovery industry that lets you seamlessly integrate your rehab tools into your life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Wednesday, a federal court blocked President Donald Trump from being able to adopt tariffs under an emergency-powers law. This sets up additional legal wrangling in addition to the conflicts over trade that were already happening. Analysts at the research firm Wood Mackenzie gave themselves the task of predicting where US tariff policy may be heading. The result is a report issued this week, “Trading Cases: Tariff Scenarios for Taxing Times,” that shows the huge gap in outcomes between a trade war and a trade truce. My main takeaway from it is that everyone loses in a prolonged conflict. The US renewable energy and battery industries stand out for the potential severity of their downturns because development here relies heavily on components made in other countries. Under a “trade truce” scenario, in which tariffs return to 2024 levels, the global economy would grow by an average of 2.7 percent between now and 2030, the report says. The “trade tensions” scenario would mean that tariff barriers increase compared to last year, but the economy would still grow, albeit at a lower rate. The short version is that Trump and his advisers believe that tariffs will help the US economy by encouraging construction of factories here, reducing trade deficits and punishing barriers to entry of US products in other countries. “We will supercharge our domestic industrial base,” Trump said in an April 2 speech announcing tariffs on nearly every US trading partner. As the US government has increased its tariffs, other countries have retaliated with their own increases. I spoke with Chris Seiple, Wood Mackenzie's vice chairman for power and renewables, to drill down on the parts of the report that deal with renewables. Here is that conversation, edited for length and clarity: Dan Gearino: For renewable energy industries, is the big problem that tariffs make everything more expensive, or is there more to it than that? Chris Seiple: Sure, things getting more expensive is a big part of it. I think the second challenge, and this is kind of unique to the power business, is that there's a heavy hand of regulation. It's particularly challenging for this industry to be able to navigate that, and it impacts renewables more than it impacts, say, other sectors like gas or coal, because we rely upon imports of equipment to such a bigger degree, especially for battery storage, where we're essentially entirely dependent at this point on imports from China. With battery storage, there has been an attempt to increase manufacturing capacity in the US. A lot of battery manufacturing that's going on within the US is meant to supply batteries to EV vehicles, not stationary utility-scale storage projects. And so the amount of manufacturing capacity in comparison to what the demand is for that equipment results in us importing well more than 90 percent of what we need. Chris Seiple is Wood Mackenzie's vice chairman for power and renewables. Having that uncertainty around the investment climate and what the level of tariffs is going to be over the long-term just makes it more challenging to make all of those decisions. During the early part of this year, as this tariff war was starting, I had, like, biweekly calls from this manufacturer in Korea, just exasperated, saying, “Doesn't the US government know that we're making long lead time decisions, and we need to have some sort of clarity around what the policy environment is going to be, not just for the next four years, but for the next 10 years?” The US is making it very challenging right now to make these types of investment decisions. Is there any US energy industry that benefits from trade tensions? I don't think anybody benefits, per se, from the trade tensions. The fact that we are an exporter of natural gas and have all of the domestic resources that we need makes it less impacted by tariffs than what other sectors are, like renewables. But even for E&P [exploration and production of oil and gas], they utilize steel in that process. It has a negative impact on all energy sectors. One part of this report that jumped out to me is you said that the US may be stuck with older technologies, especially when it comes to solar, while the rest of the world advances at a quicker pace. Before I answer that question directly, let me just give you some context. We estimate that the cost of building a utility-scale solar project is about $1.15 a watt in the US. The comparable number in China is about 42 cents a watt. It's not surprising that the cost of building a solar facility in China is a lot less than the cost of building a solar facility in the US. So the US is almost 50 percent more expensive to build a solar facility than the cost of building it in Europe. And the biggest reason that it's more expensive here is because of all the tariffs that we have on solar. And then, on the technology evolution issue, it's the Chinese manufacturers that have the most sophisticated capability in solar manufacturing, and who are putting a lot more R&D into it than any US company is doing. And so, we essentially have policies in place that prohibit and make it uneconomic for US companies to be able to purchase Chinese technology, then that is what leaves us in a position where we're not using the most advanced technology that's available to the rest of the world. The long-term implication of that is it deprives the US of a low-cost source of energy that's available everywhere else, and creates kind of an unlevel playing field in our efforts to have to power our industries with the lowest-cost energy solutions that are available. These tariff policies seem to change almost daily. Is there an expectation that eventually things will settle down? Nobody can really fully answer that question, and what makes it particularly challenging is that there've been so many different rationales given as to why we're pursuing one tariff or another that it makes it hard to divine what the ultimate endgame is going to be.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Bloomberg reports that this year at WWDC, Apple plans to announce a broad overhaul of all of its operating systems. Starting this year, Apple will reportedly begin denoting each OS version for each product by year, instead of by version. Here's more you may have missed this week: The overhaul could encompass everything from updated icons, apps, buttons, and a fresh design language, and it's expected to be universal across all the operating systems. Apple's fundamentally simple and irresistible user interface is a core part of the company's DNA, so it will be interesting to see how customers react to a big redesign (hopefully better than the Apple Photos redesign). After a light smattering of features when it launched the OnePlus 13 in January, OnePlus is now ready to go all in on AI for its phones. Dubbed the Plus Key, you can customize it to trigger specific apps or shortcuts on the phone, with an interface that looks almost exactly like Apple's Action Button. By default, it launches AI Plus Mind, a system that will save whatever's on the screen so you can recall it later. Samsung is rumored to announce its next generation of folding phones sometime this summer—the Galaxy Z Fold7 and Z Flip7—and the company officially confirmed this in a blog post announcing the rollout of the One UI 8 beta program. One UI is the name of Samsung's Android layer, and version eight is based on the upcoming version of Android 16. While the beta program will be available for existing devices, Samsung says One UI 8 will “debut on Samsung's newest foldables this summer,” making them the first to run Android 16. This is likely because Google moved up the Android 16 window; instead of arriving in October, it's coming midsummer. Google celebrated the 10th anniversary of Google Photos on May 28, and it has dished out a few new features to mark the occasion, including making a few Pixel 9-exclusive capabilities—like the Reimagine and Auto Frame AI features—more broadly available. A redesigned editor now also shows more editing tools at a glance, and you can also select parts of the image to access specific tools instead of hunting for them in menus. A new “AI Enhance” button will also merge several of Google's AI capabilities, like Magic Eraser, with other standard editing tools for a faster edit. The new redesigned editing layout will roll out to Android devices in June, with iOS getting the update later this year. Also new is the capability to generate a QR code to share albums with people around you (or print it out for group events). The GR IV has a new lens with seven elements, but it remains the same focal length: 18.3mm f/2.8 (roughly 28mm in 35mm equivalent). So far, no word on whether there will be a GR IVx to replace the 40mm lens model. Like the GR III, there is no flash. Perhaps the most interesting news for fans of the GR camera series is that there will be face and eye detection autofocus tracking, which would seem to mean autofocus has been improved. If the GR III has a weakness, it's autofocus. There will also be 53 gigabytes of built-in storage (usable), which is perfect for a camera like this, though my enthusiasm for that is tempered by the fact that the GR IV will use microSD cards rather than full-size SD. The GR IV is set to arrive this fall, with another model featuring a Highlight Diffusion Filter coming "after winter 2025." Interestingly, Ricoh says production and shipment of the Ricoh GR III will stop in July 2025, due to difficulty in procuring parts and components. The 40mm GRIIIx will continue to be sold for now.
