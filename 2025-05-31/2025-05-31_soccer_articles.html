Forward Izzy Engle led the team with four goals, becoming the eighth player in team history to score four goals in a U-20 Concacaf Championship match. Midfielder Kennedy Fuller also had a standout performance, converting a penalty kick and providing three assists.

Fuller would get her goal in the 13th minute after converting a penalty kick. Then came the first of two Fuller-to-Engle connections. Ullmark then made it 5-0 in the 37th minute. Just two minutes into the second half, Engle notched her fourth goal of the match. Defender Kate Scott ripped a shot from just outside of the top of the box and forced the Guyanese ‘keeper into a diving save. The USA outshot Guyana 34-2 and did not allow a shot on goal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Erling Haaland appears to be making the most of his brief time off this summer after enduring a nightmare campaign with Manchester City. The no-nonsense striker brutally admitted he and his team-mates were not 'good enough' as they went trophyless for the first time in eight years and surrendered the Premier League title to rivals Liverpool, finishing in third. They won 2-0 at Fulham on the last day of the season to secure a spot at the top table in Europe but will return to action just 24 days later. Enjoying a breather before hopping on board City's flight out, Haaland took to social media to share a photo of himself holding two large lobsters. Erling Haaland appears to be making the most of his downtime ahead of the Club World Cup Haaland is now back fit and firing after recovering from an ankle injury sustained in the 2-1 victory over Bournemouth in March, but he was powerless to prevent City from losing the FA Cup final against Crystal Palace at Wembley. He was on target at Craven Cottage, however, and will hope to find the back of the net again as City target another Club World Cup triumph, having won it back in 2023. In the new-look edition, City will play Moroccan side Wydad AC on 18 June, Al Ain from the United Arab Emirates on 23 June and finally Juventus three days later. Exactly a month later, the new Premier League season will get underway. 'Normally these players are off and they're starting to think about vacation time etc. Honestly, every player I spoke to was telling me, we're coming back. 'We're ready to come back in three weeks' time. I was speaking to Rodri as an example, he's looking for games. Erling didn't want to go on vacation. 'He wanted to stay with the physios and prepare for next season. 'We're going to come back strong, with a lot of positivity.' By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Player We Can't Write About It was her 11th goal for the national team. While the crowd's cheers filled SoFi Stadium, they did not see what happened in the locker room at halftime. Rodman's sweat-soaked, mud-streaked jersey was carefully collected by the team's equipment manager and placed in a sealed container bound for a warehouse in Amsterdam with eight other jerseys. These belonged to her teammates: Lindsey Heaps, Catarina Macario, Tara McKeown, Emily Fox, Allyson Sentnor, Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Crystal Dunn and Sam Coffey. Almost three months later, on Saturday, the jersey was sold for $1,833 on MatchWornShirt.com, an online marketplace that auctions signed match-worn shirts from around the world. The Dutch company collaborates with over 300 soccer clubs and federations across 35 countries, and it has just signed a deal with both U.S. national teams. During the USWNT's friendly against China in Minnesota on Saturday, the platform will launch its first live auction tied to a match. Every jersey worn will be up for grabs. The idea of selling worn jerseys came to brothers and co-founders Bob and Tijmen Zonderwijk in 2016 while they were searching for a special gift for their father, a die-hard Ajax supporter, who was moving across the country for work. They wanted to get him a match-worn, signed jersey from one of his favorite players to hang in his new office. After a year trying to convince Dutch clubs of their new idea, one finally gave in: FC Twente, where Dutch captain Jill Roord recently signed. After that, he said, ‘Hey, it sounds like a win-win. So we were like, ‘s***, this is happening! In addition to a handful of USWNT and USMNT jerseys, the company's warehouse in Amsterdam is home to about 9,000 match-worn jerseys. Historically, the locker room and those sweat-soaked jerseys are sacred for players. The Zonderwijk brothers, lifelong soccer fans, knew better than to mess with that. “We don't want to interfere with those traditions,” Tijmen Zonderwijk said. Which means the Rodman jersey that just sold is certified and guaranteed to be the very shirt she scored in. Operationally, every club is structured differently but MatchWornShirt's co-founders realized that to streamline their operations, they had to work with the most important person in the room: the kit managers. Last year, they hosted the first European conference of kit managers in Amsterdam, inviting 180 club representatives and 90 kit managers from partner clubs. “The good thing about kitmen is that they are structured and reliable. They have their own protocols and once we become part of that protocol, we are all good,” Tijmen explained. This is especially crucial when it comes to getting the jerseys cleaned. “If it smelled like flowers, then people might also question the authenticity.” Once the jerseys are cleaned, the process of authentication starts: using match footage, they check how patches are printed to match them to the player wearing them. Then they chip the shirts with NFC (Near Field Communication) chips that carry a unique ID to certify their authenticity. NFC, commonly used for non-contact payments, uses close-range wireless technology to communicate between devises. So far, the highest price paid for a women's match-worn shirt belongs to Sophia Smith's (now Wilson) No. But each partnership is tailored to reflect the commercial and charitable priorities of the teams and organizations involved. That means the proceeds are shared, and players get a cut. According to their financial statements from 2023, the organization paid its members $1,059,963 in royalties which amounts to 34.7 percent of the total revenue. The U.S. Women's National Team Players Association's (USWNTPA) Department of Labor report from 2024 shows that in 2023 former U.S. forward Alex Morgan took home the most in overall royalties ($167,593). Wilson ($74,232) and Rodman ($41,643) weren't far behind. “With so many newcomers earning their first caps for the USWNT, these jerseys carry deep significance,” Annie Mitchell-Reid, the director of strategic partnerships and business at USWNTPA, told The Athletic. “Think of sisters Alyssa and Gisele Thompson making their debuts side by side, and others who will wear the stars and stripes for the first time or even the last time. There are so many amazing moments to come that fans can have a tangible piece of.” But what happens if a jersey doesn't sell at one of MatchWorn's auctions?

China, ranked 17th in the world, is always a tough out, and the two teams have a history that dates back to 1986.

Head coach Emma Hayes echoed that sentiment after calling LaBonta up for the two friendlies versus China PR (May 31 at 5:30 p.m. “She's trained really well this week, and she's fit really well into the group,” Hayes said. Brings a lot of great energy to the locker room.” Hayes has harped on developing the young pool of talent in the lead-up to larger tournaments like the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2027, but that doesn't mean sacrificing leadership. Hayes sees LaBonta as a great role model for players like 17-year-old Yohannes. In June 2024, Yohannes earned her first cap — and her first goal — at Allianz Field in St. Paul, Minn. where LaBonta dons the red, white and blue for the first time. So, as Yohannes is learning tactically from a seasoned player like LaBonta, she's also sharing her breakfast combo and other valuable knowledge all first-timers need to know just as others taught her. “[Veterans] have been here for so long, so they know how it is coming in as a first timer, and now that I've been in camp for a little while, I think I've grown my comfortability,” Yohannes said. Meanwhile, for LaBonta, it's a balance trying to learn as a newbie and being a leader for players like Yohannes and her Kansas City Current teammate Michelle Cooper. “It's interesting because they have all the answers, right?” LaBonta said. International soccer is a different style of play from what LaBonta is used to as captain at Current, the No. Yohannes, however, is developing in the international system. That's where LaBonta and other leaders come in. “[Yohannes] has got unbelievable maturity and coachability, and someone who I know is going to become an important part of our program,” Hayes said, “but I'm invested in that development, and we have to be patient with that.”</p>

This new competition is really an expanded version of the Club World Cup we've seen before, but which previously featured fewer teams. So, how does the new-look Club World Cup look and when is it on this summer? Group D: Flamengo vs Esperance de Tunis – Lincoln Financial Field, Philadelphia; kick off 2am Group F: Fluminense vs Borussia Dortmund – MetLife Stadium, New York New Jersey; kick off 5pm Group E: River Plate vs Urawa Red Diamonds – Lumen Field, Seattle; kick off 8pm Group F: Ulsan HD vs Mamelodi Sundowns – Inter&Co Stadium, Orlando; kick off 11pm Group H: FC Salzburg vs Real Madrid – Lincoln Financial Field, Philadelphia; kick off 2am The biggest names from England Europe to watch out for are Chelsea, Manchester City, Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain, Inter Milan and Juventus. From elsewhere, we could see some big-name players in action for Saudi and MLS clubs. Lionel Messi's Inter Miami will undoubtedly be one star attraction, while Al Hilal also boast big names like Ruben Neves, Kalidou Koulibaly and Joao Cancelo on their books. If Real had waited to sign Alexander-Arnold at the end of his contract, he'd have been free, but wouldn't have been able to play for them in the Club World Cup, so Madrid will feel it was worth paying a small amount to get him in earlier. When you look at the prize money on offer, with Los Blancos sure to be one of the tournament favourites, it's hard to argue against that probably being a smart decision. There's no doubt that the introduction of this new tournament has attracted criticism. We're already seeing so many injuries due to high work load, with the footballing calendar busier than ever, and with the modern game so fast and intense.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. women's national team is back in action as they prepare to face China and Jamaica in a pair of friendlies. The stars and stripes will kick off their summer calendar when they face China on Saturday at Allianz Field in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Lo'eau LaBonta, a 32-year-old NWSL midfielder and Attacking Third contributor, is participating in her first senior national team camp. Angel City FC fullback Gisele Thompson departed national team camp due to a minor hip injury, U.S. Soccer announced on Thursday. The defender typically plays outside back for her club, and was previously in national team camps as a defender, but Hayes named Thompson as part of the forward core with aspirations to evaluate the player as a winger alongside her older sister Alyssa Thompson. Here are storylines, how you can watch the match and more: Goals were scored by Sophia Wilson, Lindsey Heaps, Trinity Rodman, Sam Coffey, and Jaedyn Shaw. Orlando Pride, and former Penn State alum, Kerry Abello is in her first national team camp following a standout year where she helped Orlando win the 2024 NWSL Shield and NWSL Championship and earned NWSL Second Best XI honors. She joins a list of 23 players who earned first time call-ups to the national team under Emma Hayes. "Honestly, my mentality is just to give it my best and try to soak in as much of it as I can, and kind of lead with curiosity and gratitude, just for being here. So, I think it's a big relief in a way for me to just get the opportunity to give it my best shot, and then the decisions that are made after that are, are out of my hands. So, yeah, I'm kind of just coming into it blind in the best way. USWNT: Phallon Tulis-Joyce; Emily Fox, Tara McKeown, Emily Sonnett, Crystal Dunn; Sam Coffey, Lily Yohannes, Lindsey Heaps; Ally Sentnor, Catarina Macario, Alyssa Thompson China: Xu Huan; Dou Jiaxing, Wu Haiyan, Linlin Wang,  Li Mengwen; Wang Yanwen, Liu Jing, Yao Wei, Zhang Xin; Jin Kun, Shao Ziqin Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign): During a roster announcement press conference, Hayes referenced Dickey's NWSL stats, "the data don't lie," and the coach is correct. Among American goalkeepers active in NWSL through 10 games, Dickey leads in save percentage (74.3%), crosses claimed (11), and fewest goals against (nine). She's been part of national team camps, but has yet to make a debut, and that could change during this window. China is coming off a pair of lopsided victories against Uzbekistan (5-0) and Thailand (5-1) in April. The wins followed a third place finish at the Pinatar Cup in February with very mixed results (1-1-1) against Canada, Chinese Taipei, and Mexico. Manager Ante Milicic is celebrating one year with the program and evaluating his "modern playing style" approach with the squad. New players and new coaches could either mean fireworks, or some periods of figuring things out before the goals breakthrough. - USWNT roster welcomes back Naomi Girma and introduces veteran Lo'eau LaBonta to the squad - Orlando Pride defender Kerry Abello joins Attacking Third for USWNT preview ☀️ Morning Footy (Weekdays 8-10 a.m.): Join Golazo Network as it helps fans get their day started on the right foot on the network's flagship morning show with highlights, interviews and the biggest soccer storylines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LAFC will host Club América at BMO Stadium for a Play-In game to decide the final participant in the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup. Club América, on the other hand, were picked because they were the top seeded team in FIFA's Concacaf club rankings, thanks to deep runs in the Concacaf Champions Cup recently and three straight Liga MX titles. Although the game is taking place at LAFC's home stadium, a large contingent of Club América fans are expected to paint the stands yellow in what promises to be an absolute spectacle. Here's all you need to know ahead of LAFC vs. Club América battle for the final ticket to the Club World Cup. Steve Cherundolo's side arrive to the match riding an eight-game unbeaten streak in MLS, having scored 19 goals during that run. LAFC's back line can't afford to perform at the level they've displayed recently considering Club América's attack very well might be the best they've faced all year. Timothy Tillman is the only major injury blow Cherundolo has to deal with, other than him, he's got the rest of his roster at his disposal to defeat the Liga MX giants. LAFC Predicted Lineup vs. Club America (4-3-3): Lloris; Palencia, Long, Segura, Hollingshead; Amaya, Jesus, Delgado; Ordaz, Ebobisse, Bouanga Las Águilas are still licking their wounds after losing the Liga MX Clausura 2025 final last weekend, ending their quest to become the second team in Mexican top-flight history to win four titles in a row. Even after such a devastating defeat, Las Águilas are a formidable foe, perhaps even more dangerous now as they look for revenge following last Sunday's heartbreak. The legendary striker was forced to exit Sunday's final with a muscular injury and although reports indicate Jardine will play him, his minutes will likely be limited. A positive for Las Águilas is the return of former LAFC winger Brian Rodríguez. The Uruguay international returned after over a month in the sidelines and will certainly play a key role in América's attack at his former home. Club America Predicted Lineup vs. LAFC (5-3-2): Malagón; Álvarez, Reyes, Cáceres, Juárez, Borja; Dos Santos, Sánchez, Fidalgo; Zendejas, Aguirre As the minutes tick on, scoring chances will begin presenting themselves for both teams. However, after trading punches, it could be Club América who emerges victorious. Jardine's extensive track-record of brilliant knockout-stage game plans may very well prove to be key. América are poised to frustrate LAFC with their stout and experienced defensive line and the Alvaro Zendejas–Alvaro Fidalgo duo will be difficult to contain for 90 minutes, especially if Martín is fit enough to enter the game in the second half.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Few professionals have the experience Olivier Giroud and Hugo Lloris do on soccer's biggest stages. When the close friends and 2018 FIFA World Cup champions joined forces in Major League Soccer last year, Giroud and Lloris did so hoping to win together one more time. A guaranteed $9.55 million payday goes to the winning club, as does entry into the tournament's Group D alongside Brazilian standout Flamengo, Espérance Sportive de Tunis and English power Chelsea FC. Whoever wins Saturday will begin group play against Chelsea on June 16 in Atlanta. “It could be nice to meet Chelsea again,” shared Giroud, who was part of the Stamford Bridge squad that won its way into the tournament by claiming the 2020-21 UEFA Champions League title. “Obviously, it will be a massive game at the weekend against América.” While France's all-time leading scorer was notching goals in West London for The Blues and internationally with Les Bleus, Lloris stopped them in the northern part of the city for Tottenham and, as his country's longest-tenured captain, across four trips to the FIFA World Cup. “After so many years in this business I know when you have an opportunity you have to grab it, take it,” said Lloris, who finished runner-up in the 2019 Champions League final, one of 70 appearances in the tournament since 2008. But at the same time you don't want to have any regrets.” LAFC could have secured a spot in the Club World Cup via the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League, but that team ultimately fell flat, losing the two-leg final to Liga MX's Club León. “This in a sense is a way to redeem that and get us that berth in the Club World Cup,” said defender Ryan Hollingshead, who struggled off the bench that day and acknowledged lingering regret. The first of three unsuccessful finals for LAFC during head coach Steve Cherundolo's second season seemed to dash the Black & Gold's hope of qualifying for the new-look, high-profile tournament in the U.S. from June 14 to July 13 that boasts a record prize pool of $1 billion. On May 6, the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport finalized a ruling that affirmed FIFA's decision to deem León ineligible for the Club World Cup because of ownership ties to the group that runs Pachuca, which also qualified by winning last year's CONCACAF title. FIFA's contingency plan put LAFC, an 8-year-old MLS team, in the dare-to-dream scenario opposite 108-year-old América, which, despite losing the Liga MX Clausura final to Toluca on Tuesday, has reigned over Mexican soccer in recent years. A dramatic 3-1 win for LAFC spearheaded by Mexican great Carlos Vela, who scored twice in two minutes, sent the Black & Gold into the CONCACAF Champions League final for the first time in its history. (If América needed a reminder about the pandemic-era loss at a neutral site in Orlando, this week LAFC announced Vela's official retirement and named the 35-year-old attacker the first Black & Gold Ambassador.) “Listen, last time we played them in our stadium, I know it was only a friendly game, but there was more yellow in the stands than black jerseys,” noted Lloris, who became familiar with América while playing in Europe. LAFC enters the match unbeaten in its last eight – three wins and five draws in MLS regular-season action – since falling to Inter Miami in the CONCACAF Champions Cup quarterfinals on April 9, an outcome that felt as self-inflicted as the faulty finals in 2023. To get things right against América, Giroud and Lloris prescribed a sense of calm and serenity on the pitch, all the while matching or surpassing the opponent's confidence, energy and intensity. “That's the only way to face bigger clubs,” Lloris said.</p>
