                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Funding pauses, cuts, firings and information purges have destabilized the infrastructure that helps victims of abuse. At the same time, federal teams dedicated to preventing sexual violence are being decimated. Departments in charge of administering grants that fund shelters for those fleeing assault have been deemed “duplicative, DEI or simply unnecessary.” These changes limit how federal funds can be used to support survivors and emphasize criminal consequences for perpetrators over a more holistic view of justice. Four out of every 10 women say they've experienced violence at the hands of an intimate partner, according to a survey from the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Intimate partner violence can be deadly, particularly for women: More than half of all women homicide victims are killed by a current or former partner, according to a CDC study. In 1994, Congress recognized violence against women as a national crisis and passed a law that supercharged the government's funding and attention to the issue. Federal grant programs are the lifeblood of domestic violence services programs — and they have been threatened since the day Trump returned to office. Federal departments raced to sanitize their communications, eradicating decades of research and data. Meanwhile, the Office of Management and Budget issued a short-lived freeze on funding distributions pending evaluation of programs for compliance with executive orders. Nonprofits that relied on federal funds to provide services to victims of domestic violence scrambled for legal advice: Was their budget at risk because they had a pride flag on their website? Did they also have to erase all mentions of banned words? The National Domestic Violence Hotline, which is largely funded by appropriations from the Department of Health and Human Services, removed resources for LGBTQ+ survivors from its website. So far, there has only been one reported case of a grant from the Office on Violence Against Women being revoked, but hundreds of grants already issued by the Office of Justice Programs were abruptly canceled because they no longer aligned with the administration's priorities. Then it was not just current funding, but future provisions that came under fire. Revised notices included major changes to department priorities and a longer list of activities ineligible for funding. Notices posted before Trump took office didn't have any; now applications are given bonus points in the review round if they “combat human trafficking and transnational crime, particularly crimes linked to illegal immigration and cartel operations” or seek to improve services in small towns, rural areas or tribal nations. The section defining what is ineligible for funding has ballooned. In addition to complying with executive orders on gender and DEI, the new restrictions put forth a more limited view of interventions around domestic violence. Activities that “frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses (e.g., prioritizing criminal justice reform or social justice theories over victim safety and offender accountability)” are banned, as well as activities that “discourage collaboration with law enforcement.” Initiatives that “prioritize illegal aliens over U.S. citizens” are also not allowed. Rita Smith, an international expert on violence against women, is publicly raising the alarm about these changes. “I think if people apply for these grants and they get them, it may open them up to the kind of scrutiny that they're not used to getting from the Department of Justice,” Smith said in an interview. She's worried that organizations will be subject to intrusive data collection or information gathering, especially around the immigration status of their clients. “We never required anyone to show us their immigration papers,” she said. “We didn't ask for documentation if people said they were in danger. “We didn't ask them for a green card. The administration's priorities conflict with some recent moves to better reach diverse populations. The 2022 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act created a funding scheme for culturally specific service providers, which are tailored to the needs of Asian, Black, Native American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander or Latinx survivors. But how are those organizations supposed to operate when DEI is banned? How can nonprofits supporting LGBTQ+ survivors do their work without acknowledging the trans community? Guidance remains piecemeal and oftentimes unofficial — no one knows exactly how to bulletproof their organization. But the gaps left will be hard to fill. The program they oversaw — called DELTA, or Domestic Violence Prevention Enhancements and Leadership Through Alliances — was first created in 2002 to harness federally funded research and expertise on the causes of intimate partner violence, along with the connections of state and local domestic violence groups, so fewer people become victims in the first place. Under DELTA, which currently funds 13 state-based domestic violence networks, the CDC helps state groups implement prevention programs and measures how successful they are at preventing violence. “If you remember taking a class on healthy relationships, or seeing PSA about domestic violence, or anything like that in your school or communities — those are some examples of our prevention work,” said one former federal worker within the Division of Violence Prevention who was part of the administration's “reduction in force.” They declined to be named out of fear of losing their remaining federal benefits.“People, I think, sometimes take it for granted, because it's just something that's there. But those kinds of things are going to go away, and no one is going to be there to teach our kids about healthy relationships or help communities reshape the norms around what's acceptable in how we treat one another.” Hema Sarang-Sieminski, the executive director of Jane Doe Inc., the Massachusetts sexual assault and domestic violence coalition, said their CDC grant managers were all laid off. It's unclear what support her organization will have moving forward. Of the 61 million women nationwide who say they've experienced violence at the hands of a romantic partner, 16 million reported first experiencing it before they turned 18. That team developed a program called “Dating Matters,” the first comprehensive teen dating violence prevention effort in the United States using funding appropriated by Congress. Her parents became advocates for teen dating violence education efforts, arguing that their daughter may not have had enough information about the dynamics of abusive relationships before her death. One longitudinal study on 6th through 8th graders across four cities that adopted the CDC's Dating Matters model for middle school found that by the 11th grade, the program had no only reduced dating violence, but also sexual violence, harrassment, substance use and delinquency. In 2024, the team published a guide specifically for LGBTQ+ youth, who face higher rates of dating and sexual violence. In January, after Trump took office, those resources were deleted to comply with the executive order on “radical gender ideology.” By April, the whole team had been laid off. An update and rebrand of the Dating Matters program was slated to publish later this year, but it's unclear who will carry it to the finish line. “Dating Matters consumed a lot of my life and it was destroyed for no reason whatsoever,” said Sarah DeGue, senior scientist in the Division of Violence Prevention, who led the CDC's Dating Matters program for the last decade. “American teens are in the midst of a mental health crisis. … This is the absolute worst possible time to eliminate effective programs and resources that teach kids healthy relationship skills.” DeGue was part of the administration's so-called “reduction in force.” Since leaving the CDC, she has started her own consulting firm focused on violence prevention and is uploading deleted resources to her firm's website. In his first term, Trump only floated cuts to the Office on Violence Against Women and didn't follow through. Now, groups are acutely aware of how many people will suffer — and die — without the funding that makes their services possible. Two prominent lawsuits are challenging the constitutionality of these specific cuts. FORGE, the only domestic violence services nonprofit dedicated solely to assisting transgender and nonbinary survivors, relies on the federal government for 90 percent of its operating budget. In April, the Office of Justice Programs canceled FORGE's grants — over $500,000 in total —to produce a toolkit for providers working with trans victims of crime and a project addressing anti-trans hate . The federal funding freeze in January spooked Jane Doe Inc., Sarang-Sieminski said. Worried about conflicting with executive orders, the nonprofit took its website down. But after two days, it put the site back online. Reflecting on their core mission of racial equity is what changed the staff's minds, Sarang-Sieminski said. And to me that means not leaving folks behind and standing up for our fundamental principles around this work.” Half of the organization's funding is dependent on federal grants, but she doesn't want that to “cloud our judgment around our values.” “I am horrified,” said Moore, who has detailed her experience as a victim of domestic violence. “Maybe it's not intentional, but it's very dangerous as a survivor of domestic violence — a survivor in the days where there was no crisis line to call, … no information to be able to stand up for yourself. “We've made so much progress in the last decade,” Dingell said. Domestic violence services remain operational throughout the United States.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As images of burned children, starving families, and bombed hospitals in Gaza become the constant soundtrack of daily life, the Palestinian communities that survived the Nakba and stayed in the lands that were occupied by Israel in 1948 (hence called “'48 Palestinians”), are filled with anger, frustration, and a sense of hollowness and disempowerment. Palestinian activists in the town, united around the local “popular committee,” keep trying to break the barriers of repression and fear that have taken hold in their community since October 7. The last attempt was on Saturday, May 24. Freedom to the teacher Raja and all other detainees!” As we gathered in Dawar al-‘Uyun, plainclothed “detectives” started to attack demonstrators and tear down some banners that they did not like. Even as the demonstrators do not initiate any confrontation, the local police want to prove their militancy to their higher command. They claim that some banners “might disturb public order” and attack the people who carry them. Finally, the police understood that it would not be simple to stop the demonstration, and “remembered” that our march was originally permitted. One of the conditions of licensing demonstrations these days is that the Palestinian flag cannot be raised. As we were marching, the police noticed that some demonstrators were holding (not raising) the flags. They broke up the crowd violently and tore them from the hands of those holding them. In the chaos that ensued, they violently arrested a demonstrator. It is no surprise that Umm al-Fahm is where '48 Palestinians most consistently try to organize protests against the genocide in Gaza. Descending from a long history of struggle, Umm al-Fahm is where Abnaa al-Balad, the radical left Palestinian movement, was born in 1969. Naji al-Ali, the revolutionary Palestinian cartoonist, once wrote that “Umm al-Fahm is the nom de guerre of Palestine.” The people of Umm al-Fahm responded with a rare example of popular mobilization against organized crime and societal violence in the community. New youth initiatives united with old political leaderships to organize mass demonstrations against the police's complicity with the criminal gangs. The first demonstration of '48 Palestinians against the genocide in Gaza was held in Umm al-Fahm on October 19, 2023 — we tried the day before in Haifa, but were immediately repressed. The Umm al-Fahm police used this anti-war demonstration to frame two prominent leaders of the youth movement against criminality, Muhammad Taher Jabareen, and the attorney Ahmad Khalifah. We have a group of activists in Haifa that keeps trying to demonstrate against the genocide, but we are regularly attacked and dispersed by the police, so we have made a habit of joining the demonstrations in Umm al-Fahm. We meet there with activists from other regions within ‘48, all coming to encourage the most consistent effort at organizing anti-genocide activity by '48 Palestinians. Some of those who regularly join are radical activists from the Jewish society in Palestine, who are used to volunteering as “human shields” in the West Bank, trying to protect Palestinians against attacks by the occupying army and the settlers. As time passed, the Umm al-Fahm popular committee succeeded in getting one, and over the last year, the High Follow-Up Committee held several “national marches” in Umm al-Fahm, in which hundreds of demonstrators participated. After Israel broke the ceasefire with Gaza with ever more deadly attacks, the Popular Committee decided to move a step further, calling for the next anti-war demo to be held at the entrance of Umm al-Fahm near Route 65, connecting Tel Aviv with the Eastern Galilee. The street, also known as Wadi ‘Ara road, was shut down by Palestinian demonstrators on many important occasions in the past. While shutting down roads is not uncommon in demonstrations in Israel and is usually “contained” by the police, the possibility that Palestinians would engage in such actions is seen by the regime as a “security threat.” On April 5, instead of the usual dozens who attend most anti-war demonstrations, hundreds gathered near the main road. The main road was not blocked, but it resulted in a tense standoff. After a week-long interrogation by the Shabak, and after they could not prove any offence, he was transferred to administrative detention — imprisonment without charge or trial. Most of them were charged with “incitement to terror” based on social media posts that were sympathetic to the people of Gaza. As “security prisoners,” they were thrown, together with thousands of their fellow prisoners from the West Bank, to the occupation's notorious dungeons. At the instruction of the extreme rightwing government and the anti-Palestinian public hysteria, these prisons became ruthless torture centers in a way that is historically unprecedented. We do not know the real numbers in ‘48 Palestine, as most of the detainees' families are terrorized into silence and fear that any publicity would invite retribution on their loved ones. The detention of Eghbarieh is considered a significant escalation for ‘48 Palestinians, as it is clearly aimed at the Palestinian political leadership. With his detention, the ghost of administrative detention finally had a name and a face that could be published. The demonstrations that followed in Umm al-Fahm were not only against the genocide in Gaza, but also against administrative detention. They threatened the organizers that if they pressed on with the demonstration, every single participant would be arrested. It was clear that this time the police would be there in great force, and the consequences could be severe. There was another inner circle demonstration on May 17, and then the latest national march on May 24. The confrontation at the May 24 demonstration, which marched as planned despite police provocations and a last-minute attempt to block it, was another step in the consistent efforts to break the silence that has prevented solidarity with Gaza. But on Thursday, May 29, there was an unprecedented general strike of the Palestinian population in the Naqab. The house was saved, at least for now. Finally, after a long political and legal struggle, a broad coalition of movements and NGOs, the Communist Party most prominent among them, received a license to march in Haifa against the war for the first time since October 7.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hamas on Saturday said that it has responded to a Gaza ceasefire plan put forward by the US, repeating its call for an end to the war, in a move the US' Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, called “totally unacceptable.” Witkoff said in a post on X Saturday that he received Hamas' response, calling it “totally unacceptable” and writing that it “only takes us backward.” “Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week,” Witkoff continued. An Israeli official told CNN on Saturday that they saw the militant group's latest response as having “effectively rejected the latest Witkoff proposal and put forward a new offer with its own conditions.” Related article Israel accepts new US proposal for ceasefire with Hamas, says Israeli official Instead, it said that US President Donald Trump is “committed to working to ensure that good faith negotiations continue until a final agreement is reached.” Bassem Naim, a member of the Hamas political bureau, said on Facebook Thursday that the framework did “not respond to any of our people's demands” but that discussions were underway, nonetheless. Israel's 11-week blockade of humanitarian aid has left the enclave's population facing starvation. Though it was lifted last week, much of the little aid that has entered the strip since has been looted, and several people have been killed after chaos broke out near aid distribution sites, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Nearly 80 aid trucks traveling through southern and central Gaza were looted by desperate civilians on Saturday, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) said. In a statement issued on X, the WFP said 77 trucks had crossed into Gaza loaded with flour. All of them “were stopped along the way, with food taken mainly by hungry people trying to feed their families.” CNN's Tim Lister, Dana Karni, Alex Marquardt, Kylie Atwood, Jeremy Diamond and Oren Liebermann contributed to this report.</p>

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will not approve COVID-19 vaccines for many Americans absent trial data showing that the benefits outweigh the risks, top agency officials said on May 20.

FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary and Dr. Vinay Prasad, head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said that the FDA's new COVID-19 vaccine framework will have two tiers. For people aged 65 or older, and for people who have a risk factor that places them at high risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes, manufacturers will only need to provide proof that a vaccine can trigger antibodies. For everyone else, or those without risk factors, the FDA is requiring data from randomized, controlled trials showing that a vaccine prevents symptomatic COVID-19 and secondary outcomes such as death.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The situation in Ukraine's cyber domain is not merely a theoretical exercise in network security; it directly impacts national sovereignty and societal resilience. What I observed in Kyiv was a nation locked in a persistent cyber struggle, primarily against the Kremlin's digital legions — The Federal Security Service (FSB), Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) and the Russian criminal actors — now further complicated by a significant shift in the international support landscape. The U.S. government appears to be withdrawing from the cybersecurity battlefield as evidenced by its wholesale reduction in personnel within key government entities, including the Critical Infrastructure Security Agency, and directives from administration leadership not to have national resources focus on Russian cyber activities. In addition to this, the unexpected closure of the USAID mission in Ukraine, leading to the reduction of support to Ukraine's ongoing cybersecurity efforts, casts a long shadow over Kyiv's digital defenses. The Russian attacks on Ukraine are multifaceted, targeting critical infrastructure — power grids, telecom networks, the financial system — to inflict maximum disruption, all designed to erode public confidence. One cannot forget that intelligence gathering remains a constant, insidious undertow. And while ransomware may have a profit motive, its impact on essential services amplifies the overall vulnerability. Ukraine possesses a cadre of highly skilled cyber professionals, both within government agencies and the private sector, individuals who are actively engaged in the digital war. This is not a nation caught entirely off guard. And let me be clear, Ukraine possesses a cadre of highly skilled cyber professionals, both within government agencies and the private sector, individuals who are actively engaged in the digital war. As we have seen, this adaptability and teamwork are foundational to their cyber resilience. However, the cessation of USAID's programs, which included significant initiatives in cybersecurity for critical infrastructure and digital transformation — areas where sustained support is paramount — injects a new and unwelcome element of uncertainty. The loss of this funding stream will undoubtedly create gaps in Ukraine's ability to modernize its defenses, train its personnel, and implement crucial security measures. The growing dependence on other international partners intensifies, placing greater pressure on those who remain dedicated to upholding Ukraine's digital sovereignty. This is where the global cyber ecosystem — both commercial and governmental, now operating with one less major player — faces a starker choice: stand by and watch the digital defenses fray or step into the breach with even greater resolve. The demand for tailored cybersecurity solutions — threat intelligence platforms with local context, rapid incident response capabilities, and secure communication channels designed for a hostile environment — is now amplified. Investing in the next generation of cyber defenders through robust training and education programs is paramount. Strategic alliances with trusted international partners are no longer a luxury; they are a necessity for accelerated technology and knowledge transfer. For international companies, the call to action is now imbued with a greater sense of urgency. Providing Ukraine with access to the sharpest cyber tools — AI-driven threat detection, advanced endpoint protection, resilient cloud infrastructure — isn't just good PR; it is a strategic necessity to compensate for the receding U.S. presence. Investing in Ukraine's tech sector, establishing a local footprint, or forging genuine partnerships contributes to long-term stability and fills a growing void. The timely sharing of actionable threat intelligence is a cornerstone of the collective digital defense, now even more critical with potentially reduced intelligence sharing through formal U.S. channels. Supporting and contributing to cybersecurity education initiatives helps build a sustainable talent pipeline, which is crucial in light of potential limitations in U.S.-funded programs. Engaging in meaningful public-private partnerships and leveraging the unique strengths of all stakeholders are the only ways to build truly resilient defenses in this evolving landscape. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all. Our goal: reach 20,000 members to prove independent journalism can survive without paywalls, billionaires, or compromise.</p>

A ceremonial signing for the sister castle partnership was held at Himeji Castle with Himeji Mayor Hideyasu Kiyomoto and Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen in attendance on May 24. Van der Bellen's visit to Japan coincided with Austria's National Day event at the 2025 Osaka-Kansai Expo. Both parties agreed to proactively promote tourism exchanges between the city and Austria. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Last spring, when Austrian government officials visited Himeji Castle, also a World Heritage Site, they proposed the idea of a partnership to Himeji officials. A basic agreement was signed in November. “I'm confident that the partnership will help promote exchanges in a variety of fields and strengthen the ties between Japan and Austria,” Kiyomoto said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jessica Moorhouse says young people may feel like saving is pointless amid rising costs and economic uncertainty, but there is always hope for the future.Supplied Jessica Moorhouse is a money expert, financial counsellor and author of Everything but Money: The Hidden Barriers Between You and Financial Freedom. Five years ago, when the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic, I started fielding a barrage of panicked comments, direct messages and e-mails from followers on social media. The inquiries came from people predominantly in their 20s and 30s, and all were asking me what they should do with their money. As a money expert who's the same age as her target demo, I was glad to be able to offer some guidance for the questions my peers were asking, however alarmist: Should they pull out all their investments and hoard cash in preparation for the end of days? Should they go all in on crypto because soon traditional currency would become completely worthless? Should they cancel their plans to buy a home in the city and buy land in a small town three hours away so they can finally breathe? Five years later, I'm starting to get some very similar questions again, and my biggest concern is that Canadians, especially young Canadians, either haven't learned some key lessons from what happened – or worse, they don't care to, and are doomed to repeat the same mistakes. Wedding, home ownership, retirement: How to invest for three big life-stage expenses Rob Carrick: A ‘how much should you worry' guide to stocks, mortgage rates, the dollar and more At this point, I'm honestly a bit numb to it. It started when my dad narrowly avoided financial ruin by choosing to stick with his stable 9-to-5 tech job instead of joining a startup in 2000. And now this: a trade war with our closest ally, with no rules and no stable actor on the other side upon whom we can depend to act rationally. Just when we've put out one fire, another ignites nearby. It seems there's no hope at all for the future – just endless distractions on our phones that we can scroll through as we sip our expensive lattes, engulfed in flames while we tell ourselves, “This is fine.” Or at least, that is how many young Canadians feel, jumping from one global crisis to another while carrying the baggage of the ever-rising cost of postsecondary education, groceries, rent and real estate. And now with social media showing us videos of young people sipping champagne on yachts, sharing their outrageous shopping hauls or bragging about earning $50,000 a month by selling their course about how to earn $50,000 a month, comparison really is the thief of all joy. But here's the thing: This feeling of disillusionment is not unique to Generations Y and Z. Almost every cohort of Canadians has had to deal with their own world-on-fire-type crisis. Generation X also entered the work force during a period of economic uncertainty in the 1990s; not only was this era followed by a long period of economic expansion, but we also got grunge music out of it. Nevertheless, they too experienced a long period of economic expansion after the war, commonly referred to as the “Golden Age of Capitalism.” And being an elder millennial, I've also seen light after the darkness. You see, no matter how bad things are, they never stay that way forever. Just take a look at the Canadian stock market. After every contraction follows a period of expansion that reaches an even higher peak than the previous one. This is the underlying theme of my work and why I write about money for young people. It may not be easy or straightforward, and you may face more obstacles than others who have inherent privileges that you do not. But nothing is insurmountable as long as you can silence the internal noise, believe in yourself, learn the skills, and most importantly take a good look at your personal relationship with money. For years as a financial counsellor, I would work with new clients and think that my only job was to help them with their money. That's why they came to me, after all: They wanted to get their finances together, craft a budget, get out of debt and start seeing their net worth go up instead of declining or stagnating. But with every single client, it was never just about the numbers. More often than not, money was a negative presence in their lives. They start in childhood, with that very first interaction with money, and they compound based on the lessons you learned about money growing up, the traumas you experienced or inherited from your ascendants, and, of course, just being a human with an out-of-date operating system incompatible with modern finance, as we all are. So if you've developed a mindset from a young age that has you believing that the world is going down the toilet, that only the rich get richer, that you'll never be able to elevate your socioeconomic status, and you might as well spend your money freely as if the Earth is about to implode, then that will be your reality. What if the world isn't going to implode? It's not a bad idea to start saving and investing, while you've got ample time on your side, just in case the world continues to exist by the time you retire. What if rich people aren't the only ones who can get richer? What if you are capable of stepping into a higher financial position? For me, this is a rhetorical question, because I know that you absolutely are. You may not be able to see it now, especially if your income-to-expense ratio means there's nothing left after all the bills are paid – and especially if no one in your family has been able to do it before you. It's about patience, perseverance, self-confidence and viewing things through a solutions-focused lens while keeping your emotions in check. I graduated at the height of the Great Recession with a fairly useless film degree, hardly anything in my bank account and a student loan to pay off. After a year of trying to find a job while living in my parents' basement, things were not looking good for me. But one day, my older sister told me about a personal-finance blog she was reading and I decided to check it out. I then found hope amongst a whole community of people sharing their journeys, offering help and support and lifting each other up, no matter what their starting point was. Hope is what's carried me through every financial crisis and setback ever since. And hope is what all Canadians, especially young Canadians, need to hold onto to get us through this next roller-coaster ride.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I don't know what to do; this is something I've always wanted for the longest of times,” she told CNN, still with an air of disbelief. The Nigerian journalist has been accepted into Columbia Journalism School for a master's degree and was on the cusp of applying for her US visa. Akintade is among thousands of people across the globe who were thrown into limbo on Tuesday when the US State Department instructed its embassies and consulates to pause the scheduling of new student visa interviews as it plans to expand social media vetting for applicants. It's the latest in a series of moves by the Trump White House targeting higher education, starting with an ongoing fight with Harvard University and then dramatically expanding in scope. CNN spoke with several affected overseas students, who expressed a mix of sadness, confusion and fear over the latest developments and the sudden upending of their lives. Many of them asked to remain anonymous, citing concerns about possible retribution or problems in the future. “It feels like a really scary and unsettling time for international students studying in the US,” said one Canadian student who has also been accepted by Columbia. “A lot of us chose to study in the US for its freedoms but now knowing that innocent social media posts could cost an education feels like censorship.” Another Canadian, accepted into Harvard Law School, told CNN how a friend working on Capitol Hill advised her to go through her social media posts shortly after the visa suspension news broke. I don't know how to feel about that,” the student said. In addition, it had already called for extra social media vetting of some applicants, largely related to alleged antisemitism. But it's unclear what kind of post might pose a problem for an application from now on, or how these posts will be scrutinized. British student Conrad Kunadu said he'd been grappling with an “internal conflict” over his offer to pursue a PhD in Environmental Health at Johns Hopkins University after monitoring the crackdown on US colleges “religiously” for the past few months. The case of a French scientist who was recently denied entry into the US for allegedly posting messages criticizing President Donald Trump was a “big turning point” for Kunadu. After wondering whether he could manage his anxiety that “something (he) wrote in 2016” could get him deported, Kunadu decided to stay in Britain and study at Oxford University instead. Despite being grateful to have another option, he described his situation as a “lose-lose.” “I wanted to study in the US not just because, for my interests in health security, it's where all the talent and resources are, but because it's the best way to make an impact on these issues at a global scale,” Kunadu said. Like many others, he can't help but mourn the possible academic research and advances that now may never come to fruition. Kunadu and another student who requested anonymity both mentioned being anxious about exploring topics in their studies that could be interpreted as dissent and ruffle official feathers. “It's incredibly distressing as an American to hear that,” Michael Kagan, who directs the Immigration Clinic at the University of Nevada, told CNN. And if I were advising someone, I would tell them that, from a legal point of view, that seems like a reasonable thing to be concerned about.” Kagan described the visa halt as “one of many attacks on higher education and immigrants… two of the Trump administration's favorite targets,” which in this case overlap. And while the directive is consistent with what the White House was already doing, he sees this as “an unprecedented attack in a non-emergency time.” When asked whether those who had accepted college offers and were waiting for a visa appointment had any legal avenues available to them, Kagan was not encouraging. “If someone is trying to enter and not yet getting a visa, (that person) usually has nearly no recourse,” he said. The students CNN spoke with were all now trying to come to terms with their new reality and figure out their next steps. “It just feels like a kick when you are already down,” he said. ﻿For Nigerian journalist Akintade, who has always dreamed of studying at an Ivy League school, the feeling of rejection by the US is weighing heavily. “This is the message I'm getting: we don't want you,” she said, with a deep sigh.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Because Russia and France have quite similar histories. Therefore, we grew up with the same values. Now, we understand how difficult it is for Russia to defend its interests, especially after the difficult economic situation and general collapse of the country in the 1990s," he told TASS, stressing that Russia is defending its national interests and the Russian population in Ukraine from the Kiev regime. According to Munier, French volunteers consider France to be an occupied country that contributes to the destruction of moral values and the destruction of national industry. We are simply removing this echelon and considering ourselves direct descendants of our ancestors. The commander pointed out about 30 Frenchmen are currently fighting alongside Russia in the special military operation, while approximately 104 have sided with Ukraine. "Of course, there aren't as many French people fighting on Russia's side as there are in Ukraine due to the language barrier and the system of recruiting volunteers, especially foreigners. In other words, it's quite difficult for an average Frenchman with no contacts or connections to join Russia's military. <…> I think that, in total, about 30 French people are fighting on Russia's side," he said. Munier noted that, since its creation, the unit's members have worked in various areas. Now, we have returned to the Artyomovsk area, where we worked in 2023 from the beginning," he added. According to the commander, most Western mercenaries in the Ukrainian armed forces are far-right organization representatives, former skinheads, and football fans. However, there are also Western special service representatives among them. "Basically, probably 99% of these people are from far-right organizations in the West. These are certain specialists involved in recruitment. They organize structures for recruiting and transporting people to training camps in Ukraine and then dispatch them to the front," Munier said. He added that there are also ordinary citizens of European countries in the Ukrainian military who went to Ukraine as volunteers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>California parole board says 77-year-old – the state's longest-serving female inmate – poses little risk of reoffending A California prisons panel has recommended that Patricia Krenwinkel, serving a life sentence for her role in the 1969 Los Angeles killing spree by followers of cult leader Charles Manson, be released on parole. The state Board of Parole Hearings found that Krenwinkel, 77 – the longest-serving female inmate in California prisons – posed little risk of reoffending based on her age and a spotless behaviour record while incarcerated, according to the CBS News affiliate in San Diego, KFMP-TV. The state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation confirmed the finding of parole suitability, which came on Krenwinkel's 16th parole hearing, but gave no further details. A May 2022 parole board panel recommendation to free Krenwinkel was reversed by Newsom in August of that year. Krenwinkel, incarcerated at the California Institution for Women, appeared with her lawyer during Friday's four-hour hearing but did not address the commissioners, KFMP reported. Several victims' family members spoke in opposition to her release. Krenwinkel was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder in 1971 for participating in a bloody two-night rampage whose victims included actor Sharon Tate, the 26-year-old wife of film-maker Roman Polanski. Tate, then eight months pregnant, was killed with four friends, among them coffee heiress Abigail Folger and hairstylist Jay Sebring, at the rented hillside house the actor and Polanski shared in the Benedict Canyon area of Los Angeles. Van Houten was released from prison on parole in 2023 after spending 53 years behind bars. Newsom had rejected her parole recommendation but was overruled by a California appeals court.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An estimated 250 million bees are on the loose in the US state of Washington after a lorry carrying beehives rolled over on Friday. “250 million bees are now loose,” the Whatcom county sheriff's department posted on social media. More than two dozen beekeepers assisted emergency responders – some of whom were stung – with recapturing the bees, a spokesman for the sheriff's department told local media. The swarm of bees was so dense, it was “like a cloud”, Derek Condit, one of the beekeepers, told local media. Some of the beekeepers were reportedly stung over a dozen times and were using tape to plug holes in their suits. “I've never had that many bees – angry bees – at one time,” said Russell Deptuch, another local beekeeper, in an interview with local media. The lorry was on its way to the US state of South Dakota when it rolled over early on Friday morning. However, it was a botched rescue mission several hours later which ultimately caused the mass flight as a tow truck attempted to pull the vehicle out of a ditch, causing the hives to fall off. The aim of the recovery operation is to save as many bees as possible and allow them to re-hive and find their queen, which the sheriff's department estimated would take one or two days. Each hive tends to contain between 40,000 and 60,000 bees, Mr Robinson said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stand behind Ukrainian independent journalism when it's needed most. U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg on May 27 criticized former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for comments that alluded to the threat of World War III, calling them "reckless" and "unfitting of a world power." "President (Donald) Trump... is working to stop this war and end the killing. We await receipt of (the Russian) Memorandum... that you promised a week ago. The envoy's remarks came in response to a tweet from Medvedev that referenced Trump's recent warnings to Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Regarding Trump's words about Putin 'playing with fire' and 'really bad things' happening to Russia. I only know of one really bad thing — WWIII," Medvedev wrote. In the posts, Trump called Putin "crazy" and warned him that he was "playing with fire." Despite repeated threats of sanctions, Trump has not imposed any additional pressure on Moscow to push it toward a ceasefire agreement. Russia has repeatedly rejected Kyiv and its Western partners' proposal for an unconditional ceasefire. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all. Our goal: reach 20,000 members to prove independent journalism can survive without paywalls, billionaires, or compromise.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk is promising that DOGE will still find US$1-trillion in cuts to U.S. government spending and he will remain an adviser to President Donald Trump, even as the world's wealthiest person leaves Washington having achieved only a small fraction of that target. At a White House news conference on Friday, Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump tried to project unity as the former ended his stint leading the Department of Government Efficiency, better known as DOGE after Mr. Musk's favourite cryptocurrency. And the pair did not outline any plan to reach Mr. Musk's target. “I'm confident that, over time, we will see US$1-trillion in savings,” Mr. Musk said in the Oval Office, wearing a black T-shirt reading The Dogefather. U.S. President Donald Trump gives tech billionaire Elon Musk a gold-colored key for his work establishing DOGE. Mr. Trump, sitting at the Resolute desk, said that because of Mr. Musk's work, “we've found things that are unbelievably stupid and unbelievably bad” and praised DOGE's ability at “working with computers.” DOGE says it has cut US$165-billion in government spending. Trump's new tax bill contains ‘sledgehammer' to hit back against foreign digital taxes Mr. Musk's DOGE staffers – many of them university students with little previous experience – ordered layoffs, and immediate program and contract cancellations across the federal government. In his highest-profile move, Mr. Musk shut down the entire United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. Among other things, the move meant cutting off food to civil war-ravaged Sudan, and taking away health care and education from tens of millions of people in low-income countries. Other controversies included cuts to the health department and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and efforts to gather up Americans' personal data. According to a New York Times report on Friday, Mr. Musk's personal life has been equally chaotic in recent years. He has been taking ketamine, ecstasy, magic mushrooms and Adderall, the newspaper reported, and impregnated multiple women while falsely telling them their relationships were exclusive. Asked about the report, Mr. Musk refused to directly address it. He was also quiet on Mr. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. He also criticized the legislation's plan to eliminate tax incentives for building green electricity generation and buying electric vehicles. Mr. Musk will now turn his attention back to his own electric carmaker, Tesla, which has suffered a drop in sales since he joined up with the climate-change-denying Mr. Trump. He will also be working on xAI, an artificial intelligence company that may benefit from DOGE's efforts to replace some government workers with chatbots.
