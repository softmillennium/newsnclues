                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Disney's instant blockbuster 'Lilo & Stitch' is eyeing a second-weekend domestic haul of $60 million-plus, while Tom Cruise's final 'M:I' movie sits safely at No. Regardless of where it lands, Sony remains confident that the PG-13 film will sport strong chops, thanks to an A- CinemaScore and solid exits. And its net production budget was a modest $45 million before marketing. 'Karate Kid: Legends' Director Jonathan Entwistle on Navigating 'Cobra Kai' and the Test Screening-Inspired Epilogue Ralph Macchio Insisted That 'Karate Kid: Legends' Delay Its Release Until After 'Cobra Kai' Critics are far more divided than audiences when it comes to Karate Kid: Legends, which features Ben Wang in the titular role. His character is mentored by both the characters played by Macchio, star of the classic 1984 movie and, far more recently, Netflix's acclaimed Cobra Kai series, which ran for six seasons and ended earlier this year. Box office pundits are already speculating that franchise fans may have stated by Cobra Kai, at least for the time being. They add that middling reviews for Legends certainly aren't helping. Both movies continue to do strong business after serving up a record Memorial Day weekend at the box office. The bounty was led by Disney's Lilo & Stitch, which exceeded all expectations in opening to nearly $183 million domestically and shattering numerous records. 1 by leaps and bounds, is expected to earn $60 million or more this weekend, one of the best sophomore showings ever for a Disney live-action redo. Paramount and Skydance's Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning, starring Tom Cruise in his final turn as uber spy Ethan Hunt, is firmly seated in second place with an estimated sophomore outing of $28 million for a domestic tally of $122 million. A24's highly anticipated thriller Bring Her Back, starring Sally Hawkings, is headed for a pleasing fifth-place finish with $6.5 million-$8 million.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Selena Gomez is celebrating her longtime friend Taylor Swift's latest victory. !” Gomez wrote in all caps on her Instagram Story. Swift made the announcement earlier in the day by posting photos of herself with the covers of her first six albums on Instagram, directing fans to a heartfelt letter on her website. “To my fans, you know how important this has been to me — so much so that I meticulously re-recorded and released four of my albums, calling them Taylor's Version.” “I can't thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now.” Swift acquired the masters from private equity firm Shamrock Capital for somewhere around $360 million, sources tell Billboard. The sale comes six years after Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings purchased her catalog from Big Machine's Scott Borchetta in 2019, later selling his ownership of Swift's music to Shamrock in late 2020. Of the pop superstar's purchase, Braun tells Billboard, “I am happy for her.” Since then, they've remained close, consistently supporting each other through the many highs and lows of their personal lives and careers.

Fans packed a sold-out Paramount Theater in Austin, TX to celebrate the first 13 seasons of the Fox animated comedy and get an exclusive preview of Season 14, straight from the series' co-creators Judge and Greg Daniels, executive producer and new showrunner Saladin K. Patterson, and members of the voice cast Pamela Adlon (who won an Emmy for portraying Bobby Hill), Lauren Tom (who voices Minh and Connie Souphanousinphone), and Toby Huss (who voiced Kahn Souphanousinphone and Cotton Hill in the original run and will replace the late Johnny Hardwicke as Dale Gribble in the revival). Related Stories ‘Jaws' 50th Anniversary Documentary Sets Summer Release Date on National Geographic, Disney+, and Hulu Tony Gilroy Says Including the Word ‘Genocide' in ‘Andor' Was ‘Pretty Effortless' In addition to a teaser that updates the original credits (which you can watch below), attendees were treated to a clip of Hank and Peggy returning to Texas after spending several years working in Saudi Arabia, as well as a longer teaser with plenty of scenes featuring a now 21-year-old Bobby. “Where it clicked for me was when we started talking about aging the characters,” Judge said about deciding to seriously pursue a new season. Bobby is working as a successful sushi chef in Dallas — the news of which elicited a chorus of boos from the loyal Austin crowd. Worse still, it's a “German sushi robata” restaurant, which means Bobby is using charcoal, not propane, to grill his food. Tom revealed that Connie is practicing ENM — “ethical non-monogamy” — while Daniels reported that Hank taking a new job overseas was pretty hard on his friend Bill (voiced by Stephen Root). Hank, meanwhile, has mixed feelings about being back in America. Although the initial clip showed him so thankful to be in Texas that he drops to his knees and kisses the ground, what's waiting for him isn't the same Arlin he left behind. “Hank kinda liked that women were covered up and modest [in Saudi Arabia],” Judge said. […] He's looking at all the stuff that's happened in the last 15 years, and there's a whole world of things that would annoy Hank.” “Peggy is a character who feels she can do anything, and now she has the free time to do it,” Patterson said. But at the end of the day, this is still going to be about their relationship, supporting each other and encouraging each other. We just have a little fun with their neuroses.” With Dale Gribble, original voice actor Johnny Hardwicke recorded six episodes before his death in 2023. “That you guys trusted me to do his voice again is really humbling,” Huss said. “I'm not trying to copy Johnny as much as I'm trying to be Johnny and hope Dale comes out of that. … All I'm trying to do is hold onto that Daleness. Regarding any changes to the character himself, Huss hinted at another major pivot for a man known for taking big swings. “Dale's back doing his thing, man,” Huss said. We'll see how Dale reacts to the new world. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U2 frontman schooled podcaster Joe Rogan on his frequent support and defense of Elon Musk. He cited a study that estimated the DOGE cuts to the department will result in more than 300,000 deaths worldwide — more than 200,000 of them children suffering from malnutrition, malaria and pneumonia. The cuts, he claimed, have already resulted in food, water and medical aide being stranded due to mass layoffs. “There's food rotting in boats and warehouses,” Bono said during a Friday appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience (video clip below). Bono said he understands why people would want to downsize big government but says steep cuts to the popular charity program already have disastrous consequences. It just seems to me, I don't know if ‘evil' is too strong a word, but what we know about pure evil is that it rejoices in the deaths, in the squandering of human life — particularly children. Bono added that he has even attempted to address the issue with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who the singer says is “convinced people aren't dying yet.” But such instances are estimated to be a tiny fraction of the organization's $40 billion budget. Nonetheless, the Trump administration put most USAID workers on leave in February amid Musk declaring it a “criminal organization” and that it was “time to die.” That said, Rogan added, “But also, we help the world and when you're talking about making wells for people in the Congo to get fresh water, when you're talking about food and medicine to places that don't have access, no way that should have been cut out. And that should have been clear before they make these radical cuts. In the Christianity Today story that Bono cited, workers on the ground said there have already been cuts to funding and suggested children would begin dying soon. One aide worker said, “I do think we can expect to see increased mortality rates, increased infection, and increased despair if things aren't corrected.” Also, Bono's quote cited about pulling children off IVs was indeed a prediction rather than a current statement of fact. But according to Brooke Nichols — the mathematician and professor of infectious diseases at Boston University who created the prediction model — tens of thousands likely have already died. “Because I've been doing HIV [research] for so long, I just assumed that would be where the biggest impact would occur,” Nichols told The Times UK. “But I was really shocked by the child deaths from diarrhea, pneumonia and malnutrition. All experts seem to agree the proposed cuts (which reportedly will reduce USAID spending by 80 percent) will be devastating and cause hundreds of thousands of deaths if fully implemented and/or more time passes without the administration changing course. The news comes amid Musk stepping down from his official White House role and a New York Times report that claimed the billionaire took copious amounts of ketamine and other drugs during his time running DOGE. NEW: Joe Rogan sets the record straight after Bono claimed 300,000 people have died because of DOGE.“[USAID] was a money laundering operation… there's no oversight, no receipts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SATURDAY AM: It's a solid weekend following the Memorial Day holiday with all titles driving around $144M worth of business, +117% from the post-holiday doldrums a year ago. No, it's not the biggest for the post 4-day holiday during post pandemic times — that belongs to 2023 when Sony's all-pleasing fanboy animated movie, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse led all titles to a $205M+ marketplace. I'm sure those novelty popcorn buckets at the circuits are still flying off counters. Disney's Lilo & Stitch is still on track for a $60M-$64M second weekend, Paramount's Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning is showing that Imax makes a difference in weekend 2 with a -58% hold and $26.7M, and Sony's Karate Kid: Legends…the studio is forecasting $21M-$23M opening off a $7.5M Friday. Rivals see it lower in the high teens, however, as we said yesterday, it boils down to Saturday business and whether that tips more families into both Karate Kid, and Lilo & Stitch toward the higher end of its range. There is a bit of overlap between the two films demo wise, even though Lilo skews more female at 62% and Karate Kid: Legends more male at 59%. Their men under 25 demos are close (Legends is 22% to Lilo‘s 18%) and their women over 25 as well (Legends is 30% and Lilo 34%). Yes, of course, substantially more moms are taking kids to see Lilo. Net production cost on Karate Kid: Legends was $45M before P&A. It will be interesting to see how big overseas is. The franchise was born at a time in 1984 before studios relied on overseas. With Jackie Chan in the 2010 reboot, the foreign box office on that movie edged out domestic, $182.5M to $176.5M and that's without China, however, Japan made a great $17.4M. Men over 25 for Karate Kid were 37% and women under 25 the lowest turnout at 11%. Best grades for the crossover comes from women over 25 with 95%. Great exits though for Karate Kid: Legends with an A- CinemaScore, the same grade as the 1986 sequel, Karate Kid II. Of course, the biggest reason on Screen Engine/Comscore's PostTrak why people bought tickets to Legends is because it's part of a franchise they love (46%). Also interesting to note that of all the moviegoers going to see Karate Kid: Legends, 68% of them said they have Netflix as their leading streaming service. A24's Bring Her Back after a $3.1M Friday is looking at $7M-$8M in 5th place. For horror films, especially an A24 one, which typically divides audiences, the movie, wow, landed a B+ CinemaScore. Hopefully that all works in the film's favor throughout this weekend and leg-wise. Most influential forms of advertisement for Bring Her Back was social media at 21% per those polled by PostTrak which isn't surprising as it's an A24 movie, and that's where they focus most of their P&A spend. Positive word of mouth that RelishMix spotted included fans of the Philippou's Talk to Me, as well as excitement over their trailer, some horror fans remarking that the movie looks like a throwback to 1989's Pet Sematary. RELATED: ‘Bring Her Back' Review: Sally Hawkins Gaslights Kids & Channels Grief Into Terror In The Philippous' Trauma-Soaked Sophomore Feature A24 financed the movie for around $20M I hear, with foreign rights sold going to Sony for around $13M, I understand. Also, as expected, Focus Features' Wes Anderson movie, The Phoenician Scheme, is heading toward the best theater average of 2025 year to date with $95K from six NYC and LA theaters. Not as high as the director's Asteroid City two years ago ($142,2K), but robust enough for the specialty sector post pandemic which is desparate for dollars. The Angelika in NY led all theaters with $78K yesterday where they had a premium $62 ticket that included an “Immersive Experience” and popcorn. RELATED: Everything We Know About ‘The Phoenician Scheme' So Far Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning (Par) 3,861 (+4) Fri $7.5M (-70%), 3-day $26.7M (-58%), Total $122M/Wk 2 The Phoenician Scheme (Foc) 6 theaters, Fri $270K, 3-day $570K, PTA $95K, Wk 1 FRIDAY AFTERNOON: Disney's Lilo & Stitch is coming in right where we were seeing it — at $60M in weekend 2, -59%, at 4,410 locations. That hold is similar to that of the second weekend of Little Mermaid, which was also a Memorial Day theatrical release. Today looks like $17M for Lilo‘s second Friday, -70%. Running total for the Dean Fleischer Camp directed movie by Sunday is $277M. However, Sony's Karate Kid: Legends is looking lighter than forecasts with a $20M opening after a $7M-$8M Friday that includes previews in 3,809 theaters. That would put the Ralph Macchio and Jackie Chan team-up in third place behind Paramount's second weekend of Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning, with a $7.7M second Friday and $27.3M second weekend, -57% at 3,861. That's better than Dead Reckoning‘s second weekend decline of -65% sans Imax screens. Running total for the Christopher McQuarrie directed, Tom Cruise title by Sunday looks like $122.6M. The anticipation is that Saturday will work in both Lilo and Karate Kid: Legends‘ favor. Fourth is New Line's Final Destination: Bloodlines with $2.8M today at 3,134 and a third weekend of $10M, -48%, for a running total by Sunday of $110.9M. Fifth is A24's Bring Her Back with $3M today (including previews), and $6M-$7M for the weekend at 2,409 sites. Even if Karate Kid: Legends comes in less than expected, we are in far better shape than a year ago when the post Memorial Day weekend only did $66M per Box Office Mojo (there weren't any major studio releases and Garfield Movie led with a second weekend take of $14M). PREVIOUS FRIDAY AM: Sony's Karate Kid: Legends grossed $2.3M from previews that began at 2 p.m. Thursday. The PG-13 movie is a vortex of old school and new school: Ralph Macchio's Daniel-san, Jackie Chan's Mr. Han and, shhhhh, the Cobra Kai gang (I mean, is it really a secret?). Forecast for the movie is $25M-$30M in a marketplace where Disney's Lilo & Stitch is overpowering with a potential $60M second frame. Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning also is hoping to hold with those Imax screens, around $32M or less. Critics like this Karate Kid a little less than the 2010 Chan one, 55% Rotten vs. 67% fresh. Karate Kid: Legends was made for $45M net before P&A; that's $5M more than the 2010 version cost (unadjusted for inflation). A24's Danny and Michael Philippou horror movie Bring Her Back made $850K in previews at 2,409 theaters that began at 4 p.m. Thursday. That figure is just under A24's fall sleeper Heretic, which made $1.2M in previews starting at 7 p.m. before turning into a $4.3M Friday and $10.8M opening. A good definite-recommend from the fanboy crowd last night for Bring Her Back at 58%, with women over 25 giving the movie its best positive score at 83%. The Thursday crowd was male-heavy at 57% to female's 43%. Women overall enjoyed it more than the guys, 83% to 77%. On Rotten Tomatoes, Bring Her Back has been stamped with 88% certified fresh. Lilo & Stitch ends its first week with $217M at 4,410 theaters, after $9.2M yesterday, -9% from Wednesday. The pic's first week is 15% behind that the $255M for  Inside Out 2, which ended its run at $652.9M, and it's 9% behind Moana 2‘s first seven days of $239.3M (final $460.4M). No, we're not saying the movie is doing badly, we're just trying to give you an idea of where Lilo & Stitch lives. While no one is forecasting this for Lilo & Stitch, sometimes these fan-fave Disney movies can go into overdrive, i.e. Inside Out 2 owns the best second weekend ever for a PG movie of $101.2M. Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning ends its first week with an estimated $95.3M at 3,857, which is 7% ahead of the first week of 2018's Mission: Impossible – Fallout ($220.1M final domestic) and 4.7% ahead of the first seven days of 2022's Dead Reckoning (final domestic B.O.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's official: After a six-year saga, Taylor Swift finally owns her music. She took control following a tense situation that started in 2019, when her contract with Big Machine ended and her masters were sold to Scooter Braun and Ithaca Holdings. Today, after re-recording four out of six of the albums she had released under Big Machine, Swift announced in a letter that she now had control over all her old music — and her fans are just as elated as she is. Zainub Amir, who manages the update account @SwiftNYC, is still “speechless,” she says. Longtime fan Kyra Beck initially thought the letter was fake as it began circulating on social media. “I try to approach everything on the Internet with a healthy dose of skepticism,” she admits. I've been a fan since around the Red era, so I've lived through the entire masters situation, and her honesty throughout this journey has been so inspiring to see. I just feel so overwhelmed with happiness and pride for her.” “These albums have such a special place in all our hearts,” says another fan named Rachel Rogerson. The point of Swift's re-recording project, in her own words, was to devalue the original albums while they were under other people's ownership. Today, many celebrated online by listening to the original versions of classic Swift songs like “Style” and “Holy Ground.” “Knowing the money received would be going to a person who has taken advantage of someone that I deeply love was a dealbreaker for me, and it brings me immense joy that [Scooter Braun] will no longer be benefiting from both the sales and streams of these albums.” Swifties waited impatiently for her next move, assuming that re-recorded versions of Reputation and her self-titled debut album (known as “debut” colloquially in the fandom) would be released soon. In the letter, Swift admitted she barely made a dent in re-recording Reputation, finding it difficult to recreate the magic of that album again. “Reputation is definitely a fan favorite that so many Swifties were eagerly anticipating, but at the same time, I think Taylor hit the nail on the head — it's a fan favorite because she perfected that era.” Elon Used So Much Ketamine He Couldn't Pee Right: Report Taylor Swift's Vinyl Records Are on Sale After Revealing She Now Owns All of Her Music Taylor Swift Reveals Why She Hasn't Released ‘Reputation TV' Yet: ‘I Kept Hitting a Stopping Point' I've even heard of newer fans saying they were waiting for the re-recordings to listen to Reputation and her debut for the first time, so I hope they're having fun listening today!” the taylor's versions AND the originals are both so beloved to me, idc idc my heart is big enough for all of taylor's music</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The tech-bro rich, they are not like you and me. They treat the world like it's their frat house. They view atrocities not as losses of human life but as “atrocitopportunities.” They get high on the fumes of their own disruption. They think nothing of killing one of their own, should a formerly-down-for-anything bro not view the complete and utter breakdown of modern society as a chance to remake Earth 2.0 in their own exfoliated, highly toned image. They refuse to fiddle while Rome burns, but hey, they know a ton of venture capitalists who'd fund an app that'd allow you to soundtrack 21st century Ragnarok via the dubstep deep cuts of your choice. Imagine a feature-length episode of Succession that treated the final season's villain, GoJo CEO Lukas Matsson, as its main character and then multiplied him by four, and you'd have something like Mountainhead, Jesse Armstrong‘s caustic, corrosive satire of Silicon Valley mega-royalty run amuck. The British showrunner of that blisteringly cynical drama spent five years and 39 episodes giving us a portrait of filthy rich people pulling strings and behaving badly. Or rather, net-worth-in-billions-measuring contests, which is the One-percenter contingent's version of slapping phalluses next to rulers on tabletops. Among the Brewsters, i.e. the quartet of CEO alphas that have gathered together for what's supposed to be a super-chill poker weekend, the current champ would be Venis (Cory Michael Smith), whose Facebook-like platform Traam has just launched some major additions to their in-house content-creation suite. In second place is Jeff (Ramy Youssef), an AI guru getting a lot of love from the public sector about an anti-deepfake filter his company has concocted. Rounding out the group is Hugo (Jason Schwartzman), also known as Superman. Or rather, that's “Soup-erman,” derived from his original nickname “Soup Kitchen”; this runt of the litter still spells billionaire with a capital M. Hugo is hosting his longtime buds at his new place outside of Park City — serious props to the production design team for making this real-life getaway somehow seem even uglier and more bunker-like — in the hopes of changing his pole position. He's got a meditation app that will transform the mental health space, especially since that sector is blowing up due to global instability. Who better to hit up for funding then his Brewski besties? He's not the only one with an agenda, however. He's still pissed about some podcast comments Venis made and is happy to see him twist in the wind; plus the catastrophes are doing wonders for his stock. But if he can get Venis to fast-track his vision of downloading consciousness online, immortality is just one upgrade away. The more these guys trash-talk each other, suck up to each other, hug it out, slug it out, undermine and over-inflate their respective achievements, the more that Mountainhead sketches a picture of these Master of the Universe in a manner that occasionally draws blood. There are enough quotable lines of dialogue in the movie's first half to remind you why Succession was, pound for pound, one of the most profanely funny shows on TV during its run. Words matter, but only when they help these men underwrite, say, releasing tools that allow for the ability to distinguish fact from fiction. Or to let them sleep at night while whole populations kill each other. Elon Used So Much Ketamine He Couldn't Pee Right: Report The Seven Ugliest Provisions in Trump's ‘Big Beautiful Bill' Jenna Fischer Dispels Misconception That ‘The Office' Got Worse Over Time ‘The Mountainhead' Writer-Director Jesse Armstrong Has 'Some Sympathy' for Tech Bros “I think one has to?” his mentor replies, and given the way that Carell spins the sentence tells you how performative such notions as faith in humanity is for these guys. Which is why the band of bros' decision that they should literally take over the world feels like a logical next step. No, really, we're asking, and so is Armstrong: How could we keep these delusional ratfuckers from what they believe is their destiny of total dominion over humanity? Mountainhead takes its name from Hugo's snowy retreat, which eventually doubles as a sort of Eagle's Nest for their would-be New World Order; the moniker's resemblance to The Fountainhead, designed by “Ayn Bland,” is duly noted. But we'd suggest an alternative title for what often feels like a documentary of our apocalypse, now: 4 Tech Bros, 1 Coup. This what happens when “move fast and break shit” becomes the ruling class's gospel. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's Elon Musk's last day as an official employee of the federal government, “but not really, because he will, always, be with us, helping all the way” — at least according to President Donald Trump's announcement of his parting press conference with the billionaire. Trump presented Musk with a ceremonial White House key for his efforts, and added that under DOGE's guidance “the mind-set of the senior ranks at every federal department has really changed.” Musk stated that, in his view, the work of DOGE was just beginning, and that despite his  departure he expected “to continue to provide advice on whatever the president would like advice on.” The press conference came hours after The New York Times released a report detailing Musk's allegedly regular use of ketamine and other recreational drugs while campaigning on behalf of Trump in 2024. According to sources who spoke to the Times, Musk had privately complained that his regular consumption of ketamine was causing him issues with his bladder, a common side effect of chronic use. Musk also reportedly took ecstasy and mushrooms while stumping for Trump last year. I think it is?” Musk asked in a bizarre, seemingly rehearsed bit. “I was just walking around with little X, and I said, ‘Go ahead, punch me in the face,' and he did,” Musk said. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday that members of the president's Cabinet will continue “to work with the respective DOGE employees who have onboarded as political appointees at all of these agencies,” and that “the mission of DOGE will continue, and many DOGE employees are now political appointees of our government.” In a post on X, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) wrote that although Musk is stepping away from his government role, “the House is eager and ready to act on DOGE's findings so we can deliver even more cuts to big government that President Trump wants and the American people demand.” Elon Used So Much Ketamine He Couldn't Pee Right: Report The Seven Ugliest Provisions in Trump's ‘Big Beautiful Bill' “Elon's service to America has been without comparison in modern history,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>British actor and comedian Ricky Gervais celebrated Friday, receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. BBC News reports that Gervais said he was “humbled” to have his star in a place that “celebrates the dreamers and doers of the industry,” and that his success was a mix of “luck, persistence, and a little bit of pushing against the tide.” Gervais said he was initially nervous about receiving the accolade, believing he'd have to get down on all fours and put his hands in concrete: “I thought, I won't get back up and that will be embarrassing. The Walk of Fame producer Ana Martinez said: “Finally, a star that will give snarky commentary every time someone walks by… I always knew we needed a comedian's touch on our famed sidewalk.” His original BBC comedy The Office which he co-wrote and starred in was adapted into a long running US version starring Steve Carell, and he also created the Netflix hit comedy drama After Life. He is equally well-known for his string of stand-up comedy specials, and for his ruthless barbs at A-list guests while hosting the Golden Globe Awards on five occasions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Diddy trial is still unfolding, but Bill Maher believes it has already shown that a “new rule” should be imposed for sexual assault cases nearly eight years after the start of the #MeToo movement. In his end-of-show monologue on Real Time Friday (watch it above), Maher used the prosecution of Sean “Diddy” Combs as a prism for how sexual misconduct is viewed in society and in the justice system. “A lot has changed” since the initial wave of allegations against Harvey Weinstein and many others in 2017, he maintained. “We need to keep two thoughts in our head at the same time: One, Diddy is a bad dude – really bad. Like, the worst thing in rap since Hammer pants. “And two, things have changed enough that moving forward, the rule should be, if you're being abused, you've got to leave right away.” 'Real Time': Bill Maher Compares Gen Z To 'The White Lotus' Character In Anti-Woke Rant Quite the contrary, to not expect that is infantilizing,” Maher said. “If Diddy walks free, it will because his lawyers can point to an endless stream of texts from Cassie expressing what's often called ‘enthusiastic consent' to their sex life. Years ago, “when women felt, for good reason, that ‘OG predators' like Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein would never be held accountable, why not at least get something out of it?” Maher said. Most of the initially accused perpetrators were surrounded by “all sorts of enablers” (assistants, cops, agents, “cowards” afraid to defy the person signing their paycheck), Maher recalled. In that era, “it was not illogical for an abused woman to say, ‘Well, if I can't get justice for my pain, can I at least get a receipt? Maher did acknowledge, “as counter-intuitive as it seems, why an abused woman would send complimentary text.” Unlike in past eras, though, he argued, “We're not in the ‘no one listens to women or takes them seriously' era anymore. Operators are actually standing by to take your calls.” Statistics show more women have reported claims of abuse and mistreatment over the past seven-plus years, Maher pointed out. “I understand why it can be difficult for women to leave an abusive relationship,” he said. We take every allegation seriously, but don't tell me anymore about your contemporaneous account that you said to two friends 10 years ago. Don't turn it into a one-woman show. Your only contemporaneous notes about what he did should be a police report.” 1 in the face, some of that is on you,” he said. R&B singer Ike Turner “was a psycho, just like Diddy,” Maher said. “But in an era when there was no movement to help her, Tina Turner somehow got away and she did it with 36 cents in her pocket and a mobile card.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

A pesar de todos los esfuerzos por hacerlo posible, no se puede seguir adelante según lo planeado”. El comunicado indica que los reembolsos serán “emitidos automáticamente para las compras realizadas a través de Ticketmaster y Nationals.com”, mientras que quienes compraron boletos a través de revendedores terceros deberán contactar directamente al punto de compra. En una declaración inicial compartida en las redes de Nationals Park, Shakira expresó su tristeza por la cancelación: “Debido a circunstancias fuera de mi control, estoy triste y con el corazón roto por no poder estar en Washington, D.C. con ustedes mañana. Espero poder regresar a D.C. tan pronto como me sea posible. Mientras tanto, sepan que estoy eternamente agradecida por su apoyo incondicional”. El show de Shakira programado para la noche del jueves en el Fenway Park de Boston fue cancelado solo unas horas antes de su inicio “debido a circunstancias imprevistas”, según anunció el estadio en sus redes sociales.

On a pre-tariff trip to Paris last summer, we dedicated an afternoon to pick up some of the cult-favorite products known for giving the French their je ne sais quois. While we tabled our Polène shopping spree for another time (you'd think there was a Supreme drop based on the line wrapped around the boutique), we did manage to stop by the pharmacies to stock up on sunscreens and skin care not often found on U.S. shelves. Among the items we picked up was A313 pommade, a pharmaceutical-grade vitamin A retinoid cream manufactured by Pharma Développement available over the counter at pharmacies in France. This French favorite is known as a “miracle cream” that addresses fine lines, dark spots and acne — and after using it at least three times per week for the past eight months, we can confidently say we've seen smoother, plumper skin with A313 (more on that below).

The cream we bought in France last year has a consistency similar to Vaseline, but slightly thicker and stickier. We were given clear instructions on how to use it: start with a pea-sized amount once or twice a week, use it only at night, always wear sunscreen and watch for any itching or peeling of the skin and other signs of sensitivity. Since we started using it over eight months ago, we've seen our sun spots become less noticeable, while our skin feels smoother, bouncier and more hydrated. The only irritation we experienced was minor itchiness after applying it over serum that was still wet, so we recommend waiting until your face is completely dry before using A313. Save for French SPFs, all of these are also available on Amazon — so you're (almost) getting your very own Parisian pharmacy experience at home. Get A313 while it's still on sale at Amazon for only $38 right here. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In other Canada music news, Quebec is imposing quotas for French-language content on streaming platforms. Diljit Dosanjh will be a special speaker at the event, which will launch at NXNE in Toronto's TIFF Lightbox on June 11, 2025. The record-setting artist made history with his Dil-Luminati tour last year, with his stadium concerts at Vancouver's BC Place and Toronto's Rogers Centre going down as the biggest ever Punjabi music events outside of India. The musician and movie star has continued to spread Punjabi culture worldwide, recently bringing historic fashion to the Met Gala. Billboard Canada has also announced two big performers for The Stage at NXNE. Daniel Caesar is returning to where he played his first major headlining show: The Mod Club in Toronto on June 14. A year after he played The Mod Club in 2017, Caesar also played NXNE — then an up-and-coming talent, and now, with the festival turning 30, an artist who has reached undeniable headliner status. It's a big summer for the breakout Canadian band, with a recent festival set at Coachella and another big one this summer at Osheaga in Montreal. The Beaches' new album, No Hard Feelings, comes out Aug. 29 on AWAL. The band has also just announced the Canadian dates on its No Hard Feelings Tour, including its first hometown arena show at Scotiabank Arena on Nov. 6. The Beaches' special Billboard Canada Live show will be considerably more intimate, a chance to get up close and personal with the band at a surprise venue. Quebec may soon be getting stricter language regulations on streaming services. Quebec Culture Minister Mathieu Lacombe tabled a new bill on May 21 that aims to add more French-language content to major streaming platforms, as well as increase its discoverability and accessibility by establishing quotas. The bill will directly impact platforms that offer media content such as music, TV, video and audiobooks, including giants like Netflix and Spotify. Lacombe wants to push French-language and Quebecian content to the forefront on these apps, saying it is not always readily available. In accordance with the bill, platforms would have to display their default interfaces in French within the province, also including platforms that produce original French-language content within that selection. Companies that disobey the rules could face financial penalties, although Lacombe says that those who cannot comply due to their business model can enter a deal with the Quebec government to establish “substitute rules.” The bill states that the Quebec government would have to establish content proportions or quotas on how much content needs to be produced or featured on these platforms, although no numbers were specified. While Quebec is tightening regulations, the streaming services are already pushing back against existing content policies, arguing that the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) should not impose content obligations upon them. Major companies have been pushing back against the CRTC's implementation of the Online Streaming Act in the hearing, which includes a plan to require major foreign streaming companies to invest in Canadian Content funds.
