Editor's Note: This story contains graphic images and descriptions of violence.



            Every night after returning home from work, Chen opens his laptop and switches to his secret life as an undercover activist.
    


            From his bedroom in eastern China, he spends hours witnessing scenes too graphic for a horror movie and trying to befriend people who would be his sworn enemies in real life.
    


            Chen – a pseudonym to protect his real identity – is part of a team of internet sleuths whose mission is to shut down a shadowy global network that mutilates and kills cats for profit.
    


            An exclusive CNN investigation shows that in the past year, these groups have expanded in scale and popularity around the world – and moved into more mainstream platforms including Telegram, X and YouTube.
    


            Consumers of these videos often have a sexual fetish for animal cruelty – known as “zoosadism” – deriving pleasure from watching the suffering of defenceless animals, experts told CNN.
    


            “It's become a pretty international phenomenon,” said Jenny Edwards, a criminologist and specialist in animal sexual abuse, based in Seattle. “It is happening much more often than people realize.”
    


            Activists say many of the cat torturers are based in China, where there are no laws against animal cruelty. Protected by an apparent culture of impunity, they make videos for consumers around the world – including in the United States, UK, Turkey and Japan.
    


            CNN has submitted questions to the Chinese government about this issue, so far without response.
    


            During a months-long investigation, CNN infiltrated some of the encrypted chat groups in China which are promoting and distributing videos of cat torture.
    


            The chat groups provide a snapshot of an underworld where torture is trivialized and celebrated as if it's part of a video game.
    


            A culture of competition has also developed among members to suggest the most inventive style of abuse – while creating heroes out of the perpetrators.
    


            CNN observed as members swapped stories of purported exploits and proposed new forms of depravity.
    


            Chen was in similar groups. For years, he's been watching gruesome videos and befriending torturers to gather enough information to track them down.
    


            He's part of an alliance of activists called Feline Guardians, who hope that drawing attention to the issue will pressure law enforcement globally to take more action – particularly in China.
    


            “China is now experiencing a wave of cat abuse, from elementary school students all the way to the elderly participating in it,” Chen said.
    


            Chen says the number of people involved in Chinese-based networks is “growing larger and larger,” and include foreigners outside the country.
    


            Data gathered by Feline Guardians showed a 500% increase in new torture videos added to the Chinese Telegram groups they monitor between June 2024 and February 2025 – with a new video being uploaded on average around every 2.5 hours. In the first two months of this year, more than 500 new torture videos have been uploaded, with most coming from previously unknown abusers.
    


            Some of this content is also available on mainstream websites, including a YouTube account seen by CNN which had “playlists” with more than 800 videos of cats being killed. After CNN requested comment, YouTube removed the channel and an associated one for “violating its policies,” and a spokesperson said, “content depicting violence or abuse toward animals has no place on YouTube.”
    


            More than 5,000 miles away from Chen in London, Feline Guardians activist Lara has been monitoring the global spread of this content.
    


            “It starts off in China, and then you have people who mimic these videos from elsewhere, (and) we have children who are exposed to this,” said Lara, who asked to only use her first name to avoid online retribution.
    


                    There is a drive with not only being able to get the satisfaction of torturing horrifically cats, but also the feedback and the notoriety that they receive
                


                    Lara, Feline Guardians activist
                


            When Lara first learned about the trade in cat torture, she said her reaction was “surely this must be embellished.” But very quickly, she had her eyes opened to the extent of this dark subculture.
    


            “They are treated like celebrities,” Lara said. “So, there is a drive with not only being able to get the satisfaction of torturing horrifically cats, but also the feedback and the notoriety that they receive.”
    


            Lara and Chen, along with their fellow activists, keep in constant contact despite most of them having day jobs – often staying up all night across different time zones as they try to track down the torturers.
    


            Their detective work involves combing through every frame of the footage, examining the background for clues on location or identity, and trying to glean information from their bank details if they are selling their content online.
    


            “Through repeatedly watching it, we can roughly determine some details about their life,” Chen said. “(Then) we can conduct some investigations locally.”
    


                    Most core groups require recording a video that volunteers can't do - that is, taking a cat from being full of life and torturing it to death
                


                    Chen, one of a group of internet sleuths whose mission is to shut down a shadowy global network that mutilates and kills cats for profit
                


            When they think they are closing the net, they also conduct interviews with local people and neighbors, in case they witnessed or overheard anything that could be used as evidence.
    


            Chen often poses as a zoosadist, who is trying to buy torture material, to gain the trust of fellow members. But some groups also demand complicity as their entry criteria.
    


            “Most core groups require recording a video that volunteers can't do – that is, taking a cat from being full of life and torturing it to death,” Chen said.
    


            Still, in the past few years, he has managed to delve so deep within Chinese torture networks that he's exposed the identities of more than a dozen perpetrators.
    


            Entering the disturbing world of these networks exposes an entire subculture with its own terminology and hierarchical structure.
    


            In forums CNN entered on mainstream websites, community members referred to themselves as “cat lovers,” partly to mock real cat lovers but also to disguise their activities.
    


            Once inside dedicated chat rooms, creators were also sometimes called “cat deleters” or “masters” and the consumers who paid for the videos were known as “sponsors.”
    


            Collectively, they appear to view themselves as vigilantes who aim to get rid of all “evil cats” – possibly also to provide a falsified sense of justification for their crimes.
    


            The creators even advertise specific cats for “torture to order” which enables buyers to select the animal, the tools and tactics of their death – all for a price.
    


                    These videos show cats being burnt alive, they have been liquefied in blenders
                


                    Lara, Feline Guardians activist
                


            Promotional posters are shared showing a photo, name and age of the cat, along with their “shelf life,” indicating the date they plan to kill them. The “sponsors” are urged to “contact customer service” to receive a quote.
    


            “There is a sadistic and twisted mindset for these torturers where they try to elongate the torture as long as possible,” said Lara.
    


            “These videos show cats being burnt alive, they have been liquefied in blenders,” Lara said. “There have been cases of cats being dismembered and their guts being pulled out and stretched.”
    


            The suffering of the animals is also turned into searchable terms – including “T-Rex” for cats that have had their front legs cut off and can only stand on their back legs.
    


            A Chinese consumer who regularly pays for this sort of gratuitously violent content admits that it gives him a sexual thrill.
    


            “Watching these videos gives me much stronger pleasure than sex,” said Zhang, who agreed to speak to CNN over the phone on the condition that we didn't use his real name.
    


            A married man in his mid-twenties, Zhang said he first started watching animal torture videos when he was a teenager, after he saw a report about it on the news.
    


            “It's just this fetish that I can't quit,” Zhang said. “This is much harder to quit than cigarettes.”
    


            So far, Zhang has spent thousands of dollars buying cat torture videos through the networks, which can cost from a few dollars to $50 each.
    


            He added that his wife “doesn't know about this thing,” and would likely divorce him if she did.
    


            Zhang says he can't afford to order the custom videos that are set at a much higher price, often over $1,300. But he says the other members are usually “rich people,” who he claims include officials, programmers and managers, some of whom share WeChat IDs showing their name, company or government department.
    


            Zhang says in the outside world, he is “quite normal” and would never personally hurt an animal – and even keeps rescued cats and dogs as pets at home.
    


            But he admits that he enjoys watching women torture cats, especially if they crush them with high heels.
    


                    They've said that they'll come and skin my dog, they're going to kill my pets and family
                


                    Phaedra, US-based independent animal rights activist
                


            Criminologist Jenny Edwards says the “primary driver” of this fetish is sadism – a “sexual deviance” which is “getting sexual arousal from watching these (videos) or feeling the pain of discomfort and humiliation of seeing another being suffering.”
    


            “It's part of antisocial, psychopathic behavior,” Edwards added.
    


            She says zoosadists often hide their proclivities from their families and friends.
    


            “They are leading a double life, because they have this whole other life that they completely keep separate from everything else that they're doing,” Edwards said.
    


            Some have threatened physical violence against activists who try to expose their secret lives.
    


            Phaedra, a US-based independent animal rights activist who asked to go only by her first name, said she was doxxed – the process of revealing someone's real identity – and targeted by anonymous accounts, after highlighting graphic torture content on X to prompt censors to take them down.
    


            Phaedra says she also tried to alert Chinese and US officials.
    


            As revenge, some of the abusers used Phaedra's photograph from her X account to create deepfake pornography of her – and one even used a photo of her as a child alongside dead cats and a sign that read “I'm coming for you Phaedra.”
    


            “They've said that they'll come and skin my dog, they're going to kill my pets and family,” Phaedra said.
    


            In December 2024, she also received death and rape threats via X.
    


            At one point, she was terrified – thinking they'd find out where she lived and come through her bedroom window – but added that she's “not afraid of them anymore.”
    


            Chen, the undercover volunteer, said most people he encounters in the groups are lonely men who feel left behind by society, which suggests they are also searching for connection within these groups – bonded by their unspeakable hobby.
    


            He described them as “incels” – involuntary celibates – who feel rejected by women and therefore get sexual pleasure from hurting an animal that most women love.
    


                    They're becoming more elaborate with what they're doing, and far more methodical
                


                    Lara, Feline Guardians activist
                


            Activists say some consumers are also drawn to this content because the screams of a cat sound similar to those of women, or children – prompting fears that the behaviors in this online underworld could develop into the abuse of humans.
    


            “They're becoming more elaborate with what they're doing, and far more methodical,” Lara from Feline Guardians said. “This will only get worse.”
    


            For example, Chen said in 2024, a sickening mission emerged to target an app called “Street Cat,” which livestreams stray cats or those in shelters for cat enthusiasts to watch.
    


            The networks hacked into the app's servers to obtain the locations, and they offered a bounty to anyone who could catch a cat, cut them into pieces, then throw the remains in front of the livestream cameras.  Street Cat declined to comment to CNN.
    


            In the US, Feline Guardians also found evidence of a crossover between cat torture and neo-Nazi groups, including one private Telegram group called “The Eternal Reich” with more than 600 members, which mixed torture content with videos of abuse against women and posts on far-right ideology.
    


            One member posted a photo of himself holding two dead cats in front of an American flag.
    


            Social media companies have come under pressure for not doing enough to prevent the proliferation of this sort of extreme, and in most places, illegal content.
    


            “The platforms are social media networks, mainly end-to-end encrypted platforms such as Telegram,” Lara said. “Also, these videos are being shared on other social media platforms like X, Instagram and Facebook.”
    


            Often potential consumers are recruited directly by the torture rings via a direct message.
    


                    The challenge is we don't have a cohesive way of attacking it
                


                    Jenny Edwards, criminologist and specialist in animal sexual abuse
                


            If they have commented on a graphic video on YouTube or Facebook, they might receive an invitation to free-to-join Telegram groups with thousands of members. Those who want more depraved content, or want to order something specific, can join smaller, more extreme Telegram groups.
    


            “It definitely needs to be restricted, and a lot of it can and should be restricted by the social media provider,” Edwards said.  “The challenge is we don't have a cohesive way of attacking it.”
    


            Edwards said in most countries legislation is too weak and inadequate to fit the extent of these crimes, and that law enforcement should be pushing tech companies to do more.
    


            CNN sent multiple requests for comment to the tech giants on their approach to this issue.
    


            “Content that promotes or glorifies violence is explicitly forbidden,” a Telegram spokesperson said, and “any groups, channels or users found distributing violent content are immediately banned.” Hundreds of moderators using AI tools are removing “millions of pieces of harmful content each day,” the spokesperson said.
    


            In January, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerburg announced sweeping changes to Facebook's online moderation policies, including reducing fact-checking while acknowledging more harmful content would appear as a result of the changes. Meta declined to comment to CNN other than to point to their policies which include removing some content that is “particularly violent or graphic.”
    


            X – which also reduced vetting following Elon Musk's takeover of social media network Twitter in 2022 – did not respond to CNN's questions on this issue.
    


            In China – which has some of the world's most tightly-controlled internet restrictions – censors rarely remove any cat torture content, Chen said.
    


            “In most situations there is no supervision of this,” Chen said. “China's censorship of political content and pornography is very strict, but with animal abuse, basically no threshold has been set.”
    


            Multiple cases of cat abuse in China have been reported by state media in the past few years, but most alleged that the perpetrators did not face any legal consequences.
    


            Other countries with animal cruelty legislation have made multiple arrests of cat torturers in recent years – including the US, Canada and Turkey.
    


            In the UK, two teenagers were recently charged with causing animal suffering, after a pair of kittens were found dead and mutilated in north-west London on May 3. The local police also wrote a letter to schools in the area, warning them of an increase in reports of young people committing acts of cruelty towards animals.
    


            In Turkey – which is known for its abundance of street cats – five members of a cat torture network were arrested in January 2024 for “abusing cats and engaging in organizational propaganda.” More arrests were made in February and September last year, including one for “torture of a kitten.”
    


            “In Turkey, within these groups, there are up to 15,000 members, possibly even more,” Lara said. “So these networks are spreading, and they mimic what the same networks in China have been doing.”
    


            The Turkish Interior Ministry did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            Activists say the role of legislation and enforcement is critical to shutting these networks down. High-profile cases in recent years include a monkey torture ring originating in Indonesia which was exposed and dismantled in 2023. British man Adam Britton was also jailed in August 2024 for torturing and sexually abusing dozens of dogs in Australia and sharing the videos on Telegram.
    


            Peter Li, an associate professor of East Asian politics at the University of Houston-Downtown and a China policy specialist for Humane Society International, says China is the only major industrialized country that does not have comprehensive anti-cruelty laws.
    


            “It's time that China adopts an anti-cruelty law,” Li said, though he conceded that it was “a politically challenging issue.”
    


            Li said multiple proposals have been submitted over the past two decades to China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress, but they have never progressed – partly due to fears they could impede the farming industry, and due to a cultural lack of concern for animal welfare among China's older generation.
    


            But with the growing number of pets in China – totalling more than 120 million in urban areas alone – the pressure to legislate for the protection of animals, especially from younger pet owners, will likely only increase.
    


            Beyond the suffering of animals, Li says there are also “broad social consequences” for allowing this trend to spiral. “You would encourage copycat behaviors,” Li said. “Most of the audience are young people, and (they) would be desensitized.”
    


            In 2024, Chinese state media reported at least four separate cases of university students allegedly torturing cats.
    


            China Daily, the country's official English-language newspaper, reported in May that “incidents of students being punished for torturing animals have been on the rise.”
    


            The article said the alleged offenders had been punished, but didn't specify what punishment they'd received, beyond at least two expulsions.
    


            “Simply expelling the students cannot solve the problem,” Wang Wenda, director of students' psychological health at Xinhua College of Ningxia University, was quoted as saying. “They might not only hurt animals but also people if they do not get proper guidance and help.”
    


            Links between cruelty to animals and to humans – documented by multiple global studies – could ultimately drive law enforcement in China – and elsewhere – to take the issue more seriously.
    


            “It starts off with cat torture,” said Lara. “There have been multiple cases of people who go off to commit other crimes, such as serial killers, but also those that we don't hear of – abuse within the home (and) maybe children.”
    


            “There is a crossover here, and so they're just acting out a fantasy through cats.”
    


            For campaigners, there's no choice but to keep going, despite the huge impact on their own mental health.
    


            “It's definitely changed the way that I view the world,” said Lara. “I believe that I have taken on something which I am committed to for the rest of my life, until this changes.”
    


            On May 18, Lara helped to organize global protests calling for an end to cat torture, held in more than 20 major cities around the world.
    


            Chen said he had sought medical support for his mental health, but he'll keep logging on every night because each sickening video takes him closer to a potential arrest.
    


            He said he'll watching in the hope of ending the depravity, because “someone has to do it, right?”

            When Adefemola Akintade learned that the Trump administration had suspended the processing of foreign student visas, she immediately went blank. “I don't know what to do; this is something I've always wanted for the longest of times,” she told CNN, still with an air of disbelief.
    


            The Nigerian journalist has been accepted into Columbia Journalism School for a master's degree and was on the cusp of applying for her US visa. “I don't have any backup plan,” the 31-year-old said. “I put all my eggs in one basket – in Columbia… which is quite a risk.” She is due to start her degree in New York in August having already paid a hefty enrolment fee.
    


            Akintade is among thousands of people across the globe who were thrown into limbo on Tuesday when the US State Department instructed its embassies and consulates to pause the scheduling of new student visa interviews as it plans to expand social media vetting for applicants.
    


            It's the latest in a series of moves by the Trump White House targeting higher education, starting with an ongoing fight with Harvard University and then dramatically expanding in scope.
    


            CNN spoke with several affected overseas students, who expressed a mix of sadness, confusion and fear over the latest developments and the sudden upending of their lives. Many of them asked to remain anonymous, citing concerns about possible retribution or problems in the future.
    


            “It feels like a really scary and unsettling time for international students studying in the US,” said one Canadian student who has also been accepted by Columbia. “A lot of us chose to study in the US for its freedoms but now knowing that innocent social media posts could cost an education feels like censorship.”
    


            Some prospective students have even started self-censoring. Another Canadian, accepted into Harvard Law School, told CNN how a friend working on Capitol Hill advised her to go through her social media posts shortly after the visa suspension news broke.
    


            “We were looking at a post from us at Pride, and my caption was simply a rainbow flag and then a trans flag. And I was on the phone with her ‘and I was like, do I have to take this down?' Eventually we decided no, I could leave it up, but I changed the caption, I removed the trans flag. I don't know how to feel about that,” the student said.
    


            “I do think it's real proof that it is a fear campaign that is incredibly successful,” she said, adding that she has deferred her place for this year after getting a job offer. “I changed the caption with the anticipation that it could get worse. Today it is one (issue) and tomorrow it will be another one.”
    


            The State Department has required visa applicants to provide social media identifiers on immigrant and nonimmigrant visa application forms since 2019, a spokesperson said. In addition, it had already called for extra social media vetting of some applicants, largely related to alleged antisemitism. But it's unclear what kind of post might pose a problem for an application from now on, or how these posts will be scrutinized.
    


            British student Conrad Kunadu said he'd been grappling with an “internal conflict” over his offer to pursue a PhD in Environmental Health at Johns Hopkins University after monitoring the crackdown on US colleges “religiously” for the past few months.
    


            The case of a French scientist who was recently denied entry into the US for allegedly posting messages criticizing President Donald Trump was a “big turning point” for Kunadu. “I was like, oh, wow. Ok, no, this is potentially really bad. I just don't know if this is an environment that I actually want to be in,” he told CNN.
    


            After wondering whether he could manage his anxiety that “something (he) wrote in 2016” could get him deported, Kunadu decided to stay in Britain and study at Oxford University instead. Despite being grateful to have another option, he described his situation as a “lose-lose.”
    


            “I wanted to study in the US not just because, for my interests in health security, it's where all the talent and resources are, but because it's the best way to make an impact on these issues at a global scale,” Kunadu said. Like many others, he can't help but mourn the possible academic research and advances that now may never come to fruition.

            Kunadu and another student who requested anonymity both mentioned being anxious about exploring topics in their studies that could be interpreted as dissent and ruffle official feathers.
    


            “It's incredibly distressing as an American to hear that,” Michael Kagan, who directs the Immigration Clinic at the University of Nevada, told CNN. “It's not something someone should have to worry about to study in the United States… But I think, right now, it's totally rational. And if I were advising someone, I would tell them that, from a legal point of view, that seems like a reasonable thing to be concerned about.”
    


            Kagan described the visa halt as “one of many attacks on higher education and immigrants… two of the Trump administration's favorite targets,” which in this case overlap. And while the directive is consistent with what the White House was already doing, he sees this as “an unprecedented attack in a non-emergency time.”
    


            When asked whether those who had accepted college offers and were waiting for a visa appointment had any legal avenues available to them, Kagan was not encouraging. “If someone is trying to enter and not yet getting a visa, (that person) usually has nearly no recourse,” he said.
    


            In the 2023-34 academic year, more than 1.1 million international students studied at US higher education institutions, according to a report from the the Institute of International Education.
    


            The students CNN spoke with were all now trying to come to terms with their new reality and figure out their next steps. “I'm still kind of hoping that there's a Supreme Court case that suddenly sees things in my favor,” Kunadu said.
    


            Oliver Cropley, a 27-year-old British student from a low-income background, told CNN that he was due to attend Kansas University for one year on a scholarship, but without a visa appointment he is no longer sure. “It just feels like a kick when you are already down,” he said. “Our strategy is a waiting game, we want to see if Trump is going to backtrack.”
    


            The Canadian accepted into Harvard Law School said she was glad the institution is taking a stand against the Trump administration. “If Harvard caves, everybody caves and it's the collapse of civil society, right? If the wealthiest institution with the highest brand recognition folds, everyone folds,” she told CNN.
    


            ﻿For Nigerian journalist Akintade, who has always dreamed of studying at an Ivy League school, the feeling of rejection by the US is weighing heavily. “This is the message I'm getting: we don't want you,” she said, with a deep sigh.

            President Donald Trump traveled to Pittsburgh Friday to celebrate a deal he once vowed to oppose - Japanese steelmaker Nippon Steel's long-announced plans to buy iconic American steelmaker US Steel.
    


            “We're going to be so successful. You have just, you have just started, you watch, we're here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays and American company, you're going to stay in American company,” Trump said at a US Steel plant just outside of Pittsburgh, before an audience of steelworkers in hard hats and safety vests.
    


            And he also announced he is increasing the tariff on imported steel from 25% to 50%.
    


            “The people here understand the word tariff, you understand it better than the people on Wall Street,” he told the steelworkers. “We don't want America's future to be built with shoddy steel from Shanghai. We want it built with the strength and the pride of Pittsburgh.”
    


            But Trump said later on Friday that the deal between US Steel and Nippon Steel has not been finalized, despite the earlier celebration in Pennsylvania.
    


            “I have to approve the final deal with Nippon, and we haven't seen that final deal yet,” Trump told reporters after returning to Washington.
    


            “But they've made a very big commitment, and it's a very big investment,” Trump quickly added. “It's the largest investment in the history of the state of Pennsylvania in any deal, not just steel.”
    


            The deal to have a Japanese company purchase US Steel has drawn bipartisan opposition. President Joe Biden blocked the deal on national security grounds shortly before he left office. But a week ago, Trump announced he would approve the deal, although he described it as a “partnership” between the two companies, not a purchase. When asked Sunday about the deal, he told reporters, “It's an investment, and it'll be a partial ownership (by Nippon.)”
    


            “It will be controlled by the United States, otherwise I wouldn't make the deal,” he said.
    


            Trump did tell the crowd Friday he had previously been opposed to the deal.
    


            “They kept asking me over and over, and I kept rejecting it, no way, no way, no way,” he said. But he said the more money that Nippon agreed to put up in investments in US Steel, the more he warmed to the deal.
    


            “The deal got better and better and better for the workers,” Trump said. “I'm going to be watching over it. It's going to be great.”
    


            The appearance, and his latest announcement, appear to clear the way for the controversial deal at a time that long-time allies Japan and the United States find themselves in the middle of a trade war.
    


            Trump is threatening increased tariffs on US imports from Japan and has already imposed tariffs on all steel imports. It also introduces foreign ownership to a company that was once a symbol of American industrial might that has become a struggling afterthought in the modern US economy.
    


            US Steel CEO David Burritt and Nippon vice chairman Takahiro Mori both praised Trump at a rally at a US Steel mill ahead of the president's arrival Friday. Mori called the deal a “game changer for the next generation of steelmaking.”
    


            “Because of President Trump, US Steel will remain… made in America by Americans,” Mori said. “Thank you, Mr. President. You are saving American steel. And now we will start to make the massive investments that will transform US Steel on the world stage.”
    


            But neither executive addressed the key issue of the deal – how much of US Steel Nippon will own once the deal closes.
    


            The United Steelworkers, which represents US Steel's hourly workers in Pennsylvania and Indiana, said it is not dropping its opposition, because it believes the deal still represents a complete purchase by Nippon.
    


            “Issuing press releases and making political speeches is easy,” the union said in a statement after the rally Friday. “Binding commitments are hard. The devil is always in the details, and that is especially true with a bad actor like Nippon Steel that has again and again violated our trade laws, devastating steel communities in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.”
    


            But local union officials who represent the workers at the Pittsburgh-area plants split with the national leadership and backed the deal. Some spoke at the rally Friday in favor of the deal.
    


            Even if Nippon does own all the shares, it apparently will be with restrictions. The “control” Trump is referring to will likely come from the federal government holding so-called “golden shares” in US Steel as a condition of approval. That allows the government to approve a majority of the company's board members, who will all be American, Pennsylvania Senator David McCormick told CNBC.
    


            “That will allow the United States to ensure that production levels aren't cut,” McCormick, the Republican Senator from Pennsylvania, said Tuesday.
    


            A week after the announcement, neither company has yet said how much of US Steel Nippon will own.
    


            “US Steel will remain American, and we will grow bigger and stronger through a partnership with Nippon Steel that brings massive investment, new technologies and thousands of jobs over the next four years,” the company said in a statement last Friday following Trump's announcement.
    


            While Trump repeatedly vowed to block the deal while on the campaign trail, he has signaled since taking office that he might be open to the deal after all. In March, the administration filed a motion to extend two deadlines in a lawsuit U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel filed against the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which scrutinizes foreign investments for national security risks. Trump then ordered a new review of the acquisition in April.
    


            Trump said Sunday that members of Congress had been pushing for approval of the deal as had local unions that represent hourly workers at US Steel. But the national union officials continue to urge Trump to block the deal, calling it a “disaster for American Steelworkers, our national security and the future of American manufacturing.”
    


            US Steel has threatened that it would be forced to close some of its older, unionized mills unless the deal is completed and it gets the investment dollars needed to modernize.
    


            But the USW has said its worried Nippon's long-term goal is to shift production to its non-union operations in Texas or import steel from Japan to be finished in the United States, ending integrated steel production at the company.
    


            Nippon Steel has promised, however, to honor the union's contract with US Steel and to invest billions in integrated mills in Pennsylvania and Indiana.
    


            US Steel was once a symbol of American industrial dominance. It was the most valuable company in the world and the first to be worth $1 billion, soon after its creation in 1901. It was also crucial to the US economy throughout much of the 20th century providing the steel needed to build cars, appliances, bridges and skyscrapers, as well as weapons that helped win War War II.
    


            But it has suffered through decades of decline since its post-World War II height. It is no longer even the largest US steelmaker, and a relatively minor employer, with 14,000 US employees — 11,000 of whom are members of the USW.
    


            But it is still not a company that politicians who enjoy talking about American greatness want to see fall into foreign hands — particularly in the politically significant state of Pennsylvania. So those who support the deal have gone out of their way to suggest that it will stay American, with an American CEO and headquarters in Pittsburgh, even if it becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of a foreign rival.
    


            Trump said it is crucial to protect the American steel industry from foreign competitors.
    


            “if you don't have steel, you don't have a country,” he told the crowd. “You can't make a military. What are we going to do? Say, ‘Let's go to China to get our steel for the army tanks and for the boats and ships.' A strong steel industry is not just a matter of dignity or prosperity and pride. It's above all, a matter of national security.”
    


            He added: “For many generations, the name United States Steel was synonymous with greatness, and now it will again be synonymous with greatness.”

Tech billionaire Elon Musk, a major ally of US President Donald Trump, has been consuming an alarming amount of drugs, the New York Times alleged on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The report came out shortly after Musk announced that he would step down from his leadership role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a task force aimed at cutting wasteful US federal spending.

Although the CEO of SpaceX, Tesla, and X had admitted in the past to taking ketamine prescribed for depression about every two weeks, the NYT wrote that he has “developed a far more serious habit,” as his drug consumption “went well beyond occasional use.”

The Times cited its sources as saying that Musk had been using ketamine “often, sometimes daily,” and mixing it with other drugs, as well as taking ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms.

The businessman reportedly travels with a daily medication box that contains about 20 pills, including ones marked as Adderall, a stimulant used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He has also been warned in advance about random drug tests of SpaceX employees, the Times said.

In 2018, the Times reported that some board members at Tesla were worried about his use of the sleep drug Ambien. The Wall Street Journal reported last year that senior executives at SpaceX and Tesla were also concerned about Musk's consumption of drugs, including LSD and cocaine.

Musk dodged a reporter's question about his alleged drug use at a press conference with Trump at the Oval Office on Friday, dismissing the Times as “the same publication that got a Pulitzer Prize for false reporting on Russiagate.”

He said in 2024 that “not even trace quantities were found of any drugs or alcohol” in his system over the three years of tests at SpaceX.

Musk said that his departure is “not the end of DOGE,” whose team will grow over time. “I will continue to be visiting here and be a friend and adviser to the president,” Musk said at the White House.

Ukraine will not pay $665 million it owes to international creditors, the country's Finance Ministry said in a statement on Friday. Kiev earlier failed to agree on restructuring terms with a group of debt holders led by hedge funds.

The payment concerns GDP-linked securities — debt tied to economic growth — totaling $2.6 billion, with $665 million due on June 2.

Ukraine was originally scheduled to make the payment a year ago, but a moratorium on bond settlements, approved by authorities in Kiev, allowed the cash-strapped country to avoid default. That moratorium will remain in place until the debt is restructured, the ministry said.

The Finance Ministry noted that under a 2024 agreement with international creditors, the so-called cross-default clause was removed.

That clause had stipulated that failure to pay on GDP warrants could trigger a default on other debt, including international bonds. With the clause removed, Ukraine is not required to declare a default on its international bonds, the ministry emphasized.

In April, Ukrainian authorities said they had failed to reach a deal to restructure part of the country's debt, with a nominal value of $3.2 billion.

According to Bloomberg, Ukraine offered investors two options during the unsuccessful talks, including a full exchange for sovereign bonds by reopening existing notes. However, creditors reportedly agreed only to restructure the May payment and demanded over $400 million in cash, as well as the conversion of more than $200 million into new bonds – a condition Kiev rejected.

Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Nikolay Azarov has been elected an academician by the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS), the country's leading scientific organization has announced.

Azarov, who is a Doctor of Geological and Mineralogical Sciences and a professor at Donetsk National Technical University, was Ukraine's head of government between 2010 and 2014. He resigned during the Western-backed Euromaidan protests in Kiev and fled to Russia after the overthrow of democratically-elected President Viktor Yanukovich in February 2014.

The former prime minister became an academician alongside 84 other scientists, including 39 from foreign countries, the Russian Academy of Sciences said in a statement on Friday. During the vote the previous day, his candidacy was supported by 521 members of RAS, it added.

Azarov became an academician in the Department of Earth Sciences; his specialty is the mining sciences, the statement read.

According to RAS, Azarov, who has written more than a hundred scientific papers, made a significant contribution to the theory of the rational industry-related transformation of Earth's depth during the development of solid mineral deposits.

Through his scientific work, the 77-year-old also facilitated the development of efficient and safe technologies for the extraction of ore, diamonds, coal and gas deposits, it added.

Azarov, who is a critic of Vladimir Zelensky and the current Ukrainian authorities, has been accused of treason by Kiev. A warrant was issued for his arrest in 2021; he stands accused of working in the interests of Moscow during the 2010 negotiations of a deal to prolong the stay of the Russian fleet in Crimea by another 25 years in exchange for discounts on gas supplies. The former prime minister has denied any wrongdoing, saying that the case against him was fabricated.

MOSCOW, May 31. /TASS/. The four ""musketeers"" represented by the UK, France, Germany, and Poland will not be able to secure military victory for Ukraine, American economist, professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University Jeffrey Sachs said in an interview with TASS.

""The European Union, at least rhetorically, is already taking the lead. It's playing the tough guys. It's not the European Union exactly. It's Britain, France, Germany, and Poland, the so-called four musketeers who are going to continue the fight against Russia. But they are rhetorically saying, ‘we must continue, we must rearm, we must never surrender, we must never compromise'. And so they're actually taking the lead. Now, can they live up to those words with the military aid for Ukraine and so forth? No, in that sense, no. They can't make this military victory of Ukraine happen. This is for sure,"" he said.

Sachs pointed out that they did not succeed even when the US was fully on their side. ""And the US is not going to be consistently on the side of anti-Russia military effort,"" the economist added.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, May 31. /TASS/. French volunteers participating in the special military operation alongside Russia are fighting to preserve traditional values and protect national interests, said Sergei Munier, commander of the Russian-French drone unit ""Normandie-Niemen,"" which is part of the Cossack reconnaissance brigade ""Terek"" of the 1st assault unit of the Volunteer Corps.

""Why support Russia? Because Russia and France have quite similar histories. Since the days of ancient Rome, both France and Russia have adopted the Roman civilization — its laws and the Christian faith — and have been successors to Rome since the Middle Ages. Therefore, we grew up with the same values. Now, we understand how difficult it is for Russia to defend its interests, especially after the difficult economic situation and general collapse of the country in the 1990s,"" he told TASS, stressing that Russia is defending its national interests and the Russian population in Ukraine from the Kiev regime.

According to Munier, French volunteers consider France to be an occupied country that contributes to the destruction of moral values and the destruction of national industry.

""We believe that the state of France is not France at all. We are simply removing this echelon and considering ourselves direct descendants of our ancestors. That is, free France, which, at that time, was fighting alongside the Soviet Union against a common enemy that occupied France,"" he emphasized.

The commander pointed out about 30 Frenchmen are currently fighting alongside Russia in the special military operation, while approximately 104 have sided with Ukraine.

""Of course, there aren't as many French people fighting on Russia's side as there are in Ukraine due to the language barrier and the system of recruiting volunteers, especially foreigners. In other words, it's quite difficult for an average Frenchman with no contacts or connections to join Russia's military. Therefore, yes, we have fewer people. <…> I think that, in total, about 30 French people are fighting on Russia's side,"" he said.

Munier noted that, since its creation, the unit's members have worked in various areas. ""This includes the assaults on Avdeyevka and Chasov Yar, as well as the liberation of the Kursk Region. Now, we have returned to the Artyomovsk area, where we worked in 2023 from the beginning,"" he added.

According to the commander, most Western mercenaries in the Ukrainian armed forces are far-right organization representatives, former skinheads, and football fans. However, there are also Western special service representatives among them.

""Basically, probably 99% of these people are from far-right organizations in the West. <…> In addition to them, there are also representatives of Western special services and special operations forces. These are certain specialists involved in recruitment. They organize structures for recruiting and transporting people to training camps in Ukraine and then dispatch them to the front,"" Munier said.

He added that there are also ordinary citizens of European countries in the Ukrainian military who went to Ukraine as volunteers. The commander pointed out that these people succumbed to Western propaganda since, from the beginning of the special military operation, French and European television channels promoted the idea of defending Ukraine.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theguardian.com","Trump claimed ‘tariffs are easy'","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/31/trump-tariffs-analysis","Sat, 31 May 2025 06:02:00 GMT","

Time and time again over the past four months, reality has failed to match Trump's rhetoric

“Tariffs are easy,” Donald Trump claimed in March. For his administration, and the world, they have proven anything but. Now an obscure New York court has blocked his signature trade policy, setting up a battle that looks sure to end up in the supreme court.

The plan was simple. For decades, Trump has made the case for tariffs. Now, in his second term, he would dramatically hike them on the world; raise trillions of dollars for the federal government; cut taxes for Americans; and lure manufacturers to the country's industrial heartlands, creating millions of jobs.

But this drastic bid to overhaul the global economy has proved far more complicated.Time and again over the past four months, reality failed to match the rhetoric. Threats were followed by delays. Exemptions were carved out of supposedly universal tariff waves. Even when they were imposed, it was days, if not hours, before pauses were announced.

Trump returned to office determined to ignore all the warnings that led his first administration to hold back from executing his most extreme ideas.

Long before the president had returned to the White House, he had pledged to hike duties on his country's two biggest trading partners and launch a trade war with the world's second largest economy. Sweeping levies on dozens of other countries ensued.

Each significant economic assault has set the stage for a swift retreat. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico were all but halted. Steep individual tariffs calculated for a string of trading partners were reduced to 10%. An eye-watering 145% tariff on Chinese goods was drastically cut, having been in place for a matter of weeks.

Trump's mind in each case was not changed. His arm was twisted.

Panic in the markets prompted his administration, after initially making a show of defiance, to back down. And warnings that the very people who voted Trump back into power would bear the brunt of his tariffs prompted the president, after initially playing down the risks, to reconsider.

Trump's economic agenda, which is aides are trying to ram through without guardrails, has so far been curbed by real-world consequences that failed to match his narrative. And on Wednesday, a further twist threatened to derail the core of his plan.

To impose blanket tariffs on nations from Mexico and Mauritius to China and Chad, the administration declared a national emergency and used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a 1977 law, as legal justification.

The flow of fentanyl across borders, and the fact the US imports more than it exports, are emergencies that warrant tariffs under IEEPA, according to the White House. A little-known federal court disagreed.

IEEPA “does not authorize any of the Worldwide, Retaliatory, or Trafficking Tariff Orders”, the US court of international trade concluded in a ruling. Most of Trump's tariffs – including a 10% rate on all imports, introduced last month – “exceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs”, a panel of three federal judges wrote.

An appeals court on Thursday ruled the decision was “temporarily stayed until further notice while this court considers the motions papers.”

But there is no doubt that this was a significant setback. Rather than reluctantly walk back his tariffs himself, and present it as some kind of negotiating coup, as Trump has repeatedly done in recent months, for the first time figures outside his administration were pulling the plug.

“This was a novel and expansive use of IEEPA, and an untested one,” said Greta Peisch, former general counsel at the Office of the US Trade Representative under Joe Biden. “It was brand new,” she added. “They were really testing the limits of that power, and the ability of the executive branch to use it to impose tariffs.”

The administration's appeal alleged the ruling was an example of “judicial tyranny” in the US. But a narrower decision on Thursday, when a second US court issued a preliminary ruling against Trump's tariffs in a case brought by two Illinois toy companies, Learning Resources and hand2mind, presented another legal obstacle.

Whatever happens, this process is unlikely to force Trump to fundamentally rethink his economic agenda. The US court of international trade ruling was not about whether the White House should launch a series of tariff assaults on the world, but how.

“We've got a very strong case with IEEPA,” White House trade adviser Peter Navarro claimed during a Bloomberg interview on Thursday. “But the court basically tells us, if we lose that, we just do some other things,” he said. “So nothing's really changed.”

After months of uncertainty, these latest legal spats add another layer of confusion, rather than provide clarity, to businesses trying to navigate the world economy under Trump.

“We will leave this decision to work its way through the United States courts system,” said Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. “Ultimately, the end of this trade war with the US will not come through the courts.”

Despite Trump's promises, most Americans are not as “rich as hell,” thanks to the tariffs. Nor have tariffs raised trillions of dollars, or created millions of jobs. But Trump's view has also not changed. They remain beautiful, at least in his eyes.

“Don't project that this is going to be where we end up,” Peisch, now an attorney at law firm Wiley, said of the current legal limbo. “There's going to be lots of ups and downs before we get to wherever the final resting place is for tariffs under this administration.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A California prisons panel has recommended that Patricia Krenwinkel, serving a life sentence for her role in the 1969 Los Angeles killing spree by followers of cult leader Charles Manson, be released on parole.

The state Board of Parole Hearings found that Krenwinkel, 77 – the longest-serving female inmate in California prisons – posed little risk of reoffending based on her age and a spotless behaviour record while incarcerated, according to the CBS News affiliate in San Diego, KFMP-TV.

The state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation confirmed the finding of parole suitability, which came on Krenwinkel's 16th parole hearing, but gave no further details.

The decision on Friday amounts to a proposal subject to review by the full state Board of Parole Hearings and the California governor for up to 150 days before it can become final.

Even if the full board affirms the finding of parole suitability, the governor, Gavin Newsom, could reject it or send it back for further review.

A May 2022 parole board panel recommendation to free Krenwinkel was reversed by Newsom in August of that year.

Krenwinkel, incarcerated at the California Institution for Women, appeared with her lawyer during Friday's four-hour hearing but did not address the commissioners, KFMP reported. Several victims' family members spoke in opposition to her release.

Krenwinkel was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder in 1971 for participating in a bloody two-night rampage whose victims included actor Sharon Tate, the 26-year-old wife of film-maker Roman Polanski.

Tate, then eight months pregnant, was killed with four friends, among them coffee heiress Abigail Folger and hairstylist Jay Sebring, at the rented hillside house the actor and Polanski shared in the Benedict Canyon area of Los Angeles. Polanski was in Europe at the time.

The following night grocery owner Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, were stabbed to death in their home, where the words “Death to Pigs” and “Healter Skelter” – a misspelled reference to the Beatles song Helter Skelter – were found scrawled in the victims' blood at the crime scene.

Manson did not personally kill any of the seven victims but was found guilty of ordering their murders as part of a delusional plot to ignite a race war.

He, Krenwinkel and other members of his so-called “family” of hippies, runaways and misfits – including Leslie Van Houten, Susan Atkins and “Tex” Watson – were originally sentenced to death. Their sentences were commuted to life in prison after the California supreme court abolished capital punishment in the state in 1972.

Manson died in prison in 2017 aged 83.

Van Houten was released from prison on parole in 2023 after spending 53 years behind bars. Newsom had rejected her parole recommendation but was overruled by a California appeals court.

The governor could have petitioned the state supreme court to review the case but opted not to, deciding that further efforts to keep Van Houten locked up were unlikely to succeed.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud of Saudi Arabia is to become the first Saudi minister of foreign affairs to visit the occupied West Bank today, a diplomatic source said, as the Gaza war drags on and Riyadh pushes for Palestinian statehood.

He is to lead a delegation to Ramallah, a Palestinian embassy source said, the first such trip since Israel first occupied the Palestinian territory in 1967.

Saudi Arabia sent a lower-level delegation to Ramallah in September 2023, its first since 1967, not long before Hamas' attack triggered the Gaza war.

International backlash has been growing since Israel resumed its offensive in Gaza in March, with a humanitarian crisis spiralling and the UN warning of famine.

Next month, Saudi Arabia and France would cochair an international conference meant to resurrect the two-state solution at the UN headquarters in New York.

Nearly 150 countries recognize the State of Palestine, which has observer status at the UN, but is not a full member, as the Security Council has not voted to admit it.

In May last year, Ireland, Norway and Spain took the step of recognizing a Palestinian state, but other European governments, including France, have not.

French President Emmanuel Macron in April said that France could recognize a Palestinian state this month.

Macron said at the time that he wished to organize the New York conference to encourage recognition of the State of Palestine, “but also a recognition of Israel from states that currently do not.”

Saudi Arabia was said to be close to recognizing Israel before the start of the Gaza war.

US President Donald Trump during a visit to Riyadh this month called Saudi normalization with Israel “my fervent hope and wish, and even my dream.”

In September last year, de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stated clearly that Saudi Arabia would not recognize Israel without an independent Palestinian state.

This position was reaffirmed in November at a joint Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation summit, where Israel was accused of “genocide” in Gaza.

Both countries lay claim to Essequibo, which makes up two-thirds of Guyana's territory and is home to 125,000 of its 800,000 citizens. Guyana has administered the region for decades.

With an approval rating of just two percent, Peruvian President Dina Boluarte might be the world's most unpopular leader, according to pollsters. Protests greeted her rise to power 29 months ago, and have marked her entire term — joined by assorted scandals, investigations, controversies and a surge in gang violence.

The 63-year-old is the target of a dozen probes, including for her alleged failure to declare gifts of luxury jewels and watches, a scandal inevitably dubbed “Rolexgate.”

She is also under the microscope for a two-week undeclared absence for nose surgery — which she insists was medical, not cosmetic — and is being investigated for her role in a police crackdown that caused the deaths of 50 protesters.

Against that bleak backdrop, Boluarte's never-high popularity hit rock bottom this month.

The Ipsos polling agency found she had a two-percent approval rating, down from 21 percent when she took office.

“We might be talking about a world record of sustained presidential disapproval,” Ipsos Peru president Alfredo Torres said.

It is the lowest score Ipsos has measured in any of the other 90 countries it surveys, Torres said.

Yet as far as recent Peruvian presidents go, she is not just a survivor, but positively an elder stateswoman.

The South American nation has had six presidents in eight years, and if Boluarte lasts to the end of her term next year, she would be the longest-serving of them all.

Despite not having a party in the Peruvian Congress, she has managed to stay in power with the backing of Peru's majority right-wing parties.

Analysts say voter lethargy and political expediency have so far helped Boluarte buck the trend of prematurely ousted Peruvian leaders.

“In Peru, there is a political paradox: Boluarte is the weakest president of the last decade,” political analyst Augusto Alvarez of the University of the Pacific said. 

However, her weakness is “also her strength,” he said, adding that a lame-duck president is politically useful for Congress.

“It is a great business to have a fragile president whom they [lawmakers] use” to entrench their own power and pass laws beneficial to allies and backers, Alvarez said.

Transparency International's Peruvian chapter Proetica has cited Congress for “counter-reforms, setbacks in anti-corruption instruments ... and shielding of members of Congress who are ethically questioned.”

Boluarte has other factors counting in her favor.

Congress is seemingly keeping her around for lack of a better, consensus, candidate.

Another plus for Boluarte: Peru's economy has been performing well, with GDP growing 3.3 percent last year and 3.9 percent in the first quarter of this year — a steep improvement from the 2020 recession blamed on COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

Peru's inflation rate is one of the lowest in the region.

“The economy continues to function, there is enormous resilience, and the population's income is growing,” said Alvarez.

However, this might have little to do with policy, observers say, and more with external factors such as rising copper prices. Peru is one of the top producers of the metal.

On the street, there is little love for Boluarte, as Peru battles a surge in gang violence characterized by a wave of killings linked to extortion rackets.

Boluarte “has no empathy, she is an incapable president, she does not solve the security problem,” said Saturnino Conde, a 63-year-old teacher.

At frequent marches against the president, the catchphrase: “Dina, Asesina!” (Dina, Murderer!) has become a popular refrain.

However, a full-out rebellion appears unlikely, say analysts.

Peruvians “feel it's not worth it: If she resigns or is dismissed, she would be replaced by a member of Congress, but Congress also has a terrible image,” Ipsos manager Torres said.

In addition, “there is no other candidate that captivates, which is why people are not in a hurry to remove her from power.”

“New import restrictions could jeopardize current US leadership in the competitive technology industry and create uncertainties for many committed semiconductor capital projects in the US, including TSMC Arizona's significant investment plan in Phoenix,” the chipmaker wrote in a letter to the US Department of Commerce.

World Boxing announced on Friday it would introduce mandatory gender testing to determine the eligibility of male and female athletes wanting to take part in its competitions.

The international federation said it was introducing the policy after the furor surrounding boxers including women's welterweight gold medalist Imane Khelif of Algeria at the Paris Olympics last year.

World Boxing would organize the boxing competition at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics after being granted provisional recognition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

World Boxing said it had informed the Algerian Boxing Federation that Khelif would have to undergo the test if she wanted to compete at the Eindhoven Box Cup in the Netherlands starting on Thursday.

“World Boxing has written to the Algerian Boxing Federation to inform it that Imane Khelif will not be allowed to participate in the female category at the Eindhoven Box Cup or any World Boxing event until Imane Khelif undergoes sex testing,” it said in a statement.

Under the new policy, all athletes older than 18 that want to participate in a World Boxing competition would need to undergo a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, to determine what sex they were at birth and their eligibility to compete. 

The PCR test is a laboratory technique used to detect specific genetic material, in this case the SRY gene, that reveals the presence of the Y chromosome, which is an indicator of biological sex. The test can be conducted by a nasal or mouth swab, or by taking a sample of saliva or blood.

National federations would be responsible for testing and would be required to confirm the sex of their athletes when entering them into World Boxing competitions by producing certification of their chromosomal sex.

“For me, I see myself as a girl, just like any other girl. I was born a girl, raised as a girl, and have lived my entire life as one,” Khelif said in March.

The 26-year-old is targeting a second gold medal at the 2028 Games after her triumph in Paris.

Her success, along with that of Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting, sparked a raging gender eligibility debate, with high-profile figures such as US President Donald Trump weighing in.

Khelif and Lin were disqualified from the International Boxing Association's (IBA) 2023 world championships after the organization, the long-standing governing body of amateur boxing, said they had failed gender eligibility tests.

The IOC has severed links with the IBA over financial, governance and ethical concerns. Last month the IOC provisionally recognized World Boxing as the body to oversee the sport at future Games.

Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz struck 31 winners in a 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 victory over Italian qualifier Giulio Zeppieri and is to face Hungary's Fabian Marozsan in round two. 
Alcaraz is now on an eight-match winning streak at the French Open and also took Olympic silver at Roland Garros last year, losing the final to Novak Djokovic.

The fiery 55-year-old has exceeded preseason expectations and bolstered his reputation as a serial winner by guiding Napoli to their fourth Scudetto, and second in three seasons. 
However, he might well be on his way in the summer after just one season at the helm as his charged relationship with Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis has simmered throughout the campaign. 
Conte has said

HIMEJI, Hyogo — A sister castle partnership has been established between Himeji Castle in Himeji, Hyogo Prefecture, and Schoenbrunn Palace in Vienna. Schoenbrunn Palace is now the fourth sister castle of Himeji Castle.

A ceremonial signing for the sister castle partnership was held at Himeji Castle with Himeji Mayor Hideyasu Kiyomoto and Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen in attendance on May 24. Van der Bellen's visit to Japan coincided with Austria's National Day event at the 2025 Osaka-Kansai Expo. Both parties agreed to proactively promote tourism exchanges between the city and Austria.

Schoenbrunn Palace is known for hosting the Congress of Vienna in 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.

Last spring, when Austrian government officials visited Himeji Castle, also a World Heritage Site, they proposed the idea of a partnership to Himeji officials. A basic agreement was signed in November.

“I'm confident that the partnership will help promote exchanges in a variety of fields and strengthen the ties between Japan and Austria,” Kiyomoto said.

Austrian President Van der Bellen expressed his hope to further strengthen the friendship between the two countries.

U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg on May 27 criticized former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for comments that alluded to the threat of World War III, calling them ""reckless"" and ""unfitting of a world power.""

""President (Donald) Trump... is working to stop this war and end the killing. We await receipt of (the Russian) Memorandum... that you promised a week ago. Cease fire now,"" Kellogg said on X.

The envoy's remarks came in response to a tweet from Medvedev that referenced Trump's recent warnings to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""Regarding Trump's words about Putin 'playing with fire' and 'really bad things' happening to Russia. I only know of one really bad thing — WWIII,"" Medvedev wrote. ""I hope Trump understands this!""

Medvedev's comments refer to Trump's recent posts on Truth Social, in which he reacted to Russia's weekend aerial attacks on Ukraine, including the largest drone assault since the start of the full-scale invasion. In the posts, Trump called Putin ""crazy"" and warned him that he was ""playing with fire.""

The U.S. president has increasingly voiced frustration with stalled peace efforts, signaling readiness to walk away from the process. Despite repeated threats of sanctions, Trump has not imposed any additional pressure on Moscow to push it toward a ceasefire agreement.

Russia has repeatedly rejected Kyiv and its Western partners' proposal for an unconditional ceasefire. Following Russian-Ukrainian negotiations in Istanbul on May 16, the Russian leadership said it would present a memorandum toward a peaceful settlement.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia's delays in presenting the document are a ""mockery of the whole world.""

Elon Musk's grandiose promises and the fiery way he tried to fulfill them stand in sharp contrast with the modest results.Nathan Howard/Reuters

Elon Musk is promising that DOGE will still find US$1-trillion in cuts to U.S. government spending and he will remain an adviser to President Donald Trump, even as the world's wealthiest person leaves Washington having achieved only a small fraction of that target.

At a White House news conference on Friday, Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump tried to project unity as the former ended his stint leading the Department of Government Efficiency, better known as DOGE after Mr. Musk's favourite cryptocurrency.

But the South African-Canadian-American billionaire had already criticized the President's centrepiece domestic policy legislation which, if passed, would increase the deficit by US$3.2-trillion, negating DOGE's cuts many times over. And the pair did not outline any plan to reach Mr. Musk's target.

“I'm confident that, over time, we will see US$1-trillion in savings,” Mr. Musk said in the Oval Office, wearing a black T-shirt reading The Dogefather. “I'll continue to be visiting here and be a friend and adviser to the President.”

U.S. President Donald Trump gives tech billionaire Elon Musk a gold-colored key for his work establishing DOGE.

Mr. Trump, sitting at the Resolute desk, said that because of Mr. Musk's work, “we've found things that are unbelievably stupid and unbelievably bad” and praised DOGE's ability at “working with computers.”

Among Mr. Musk's accomplishments, Mr. Trump said, were eliminating US$2-billion “to Stacey Abrams” and US$8-million “for making mice transgender.” 

On the first, Mr. Trump appeared to be referring to a grant to Power Forward Communities, a consortium of charities running environmental programs. Ms. Abrams, whose voter registration work in Georgia may have cost Mr. Trump the state in the 2020 election, was an adviser to one of the groups. 

On the second, he was referencing National Institutes of Health studies that examined the effects of hormones in mice.

DOGE says it has cut US$165-billion in government spending. Musk Watch, a newsletter that covers the billionaire, said it can only verify US$16.3-billion of that number.

The modest outcome stands in sharp contrast with both Mr. Musk's grandiose promises and the fiery way he tried to fulfill them. After spending roughly US$275-million to help Mr. Trump get elected, he emerged as the dominant figure in the opening weeks of the new administration.

Mr. Musk's DOGE staffers – many of them university students with little previous experience – ordered layoffs, and immediate program and contract cancellations across the federal government.

In his highest-profile move, Mr. Musk shut down the entire United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. Among other things, the move meant cutting off food to civil war-ravaged Sudan, and taking away health care and education from tens of millions of people in low-income countries.

Other controversies included cuts to the health department and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and efforts to gather up Americans' personal data.

Along the way, DOGE and its leader became known for a string of strange spectacles: On one occasion, Mr. Musk wielded a chainsaw onstage at a conservative conference.

According to a New York Times report on Friday, Mr. Musk's personal life has been equally chaotic in recent years. He has been taking ketamine, ecstasy, magic mushrooms and Adderall, the newspaper reported, and impregnated multiple women while falsely telling them their relationships were exclusive.

Asked about the report, Mr. Musk refused to directly address it. He instead accused the newspaper of “lies” on a different story, over Russian interference in the 2016 election. “Let's move on. Next question,” Mr. Musk said.

He was also quiet on Mr. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Earlier in the week, Mr. Musk told CBS that he was “disappointed” in the tax-cuts-and-spending package, which “undermines the work” of DOGE.

He also criticized the legislation's plan to eliminate tax incentives for building green electricity generation and buying electric vehicles.

Mr. Musk will now turn his attention back to his own electric carmaker, Tesla, which has suffered a drop in sales since he joined up with the climate-change-denying Mr. Trump. He will also be working on xAI, an artificial intelligence company that may benefit from DOGE's efforts to replace some government workers with chatbots.

At Friday's news conference, Mr. Musk had a bruise on his face, which he said was caused by his son, X, punching him while “horsing around.” Mr. Trump, for his part, praised Mr. Musk for taking rhetorical blows.

“He willingly accepted the outrageous abuse and slander and lies and attacks,” Mr. Trump said, “because he does love our country.”

And other reasons why young people aren't saving their money, but should","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-what-if-the-world-ends-and-other-reasons-why-young-people-arent-saving/","Sat, 31 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Jessica Moorhouse says young people may feel like saving is pointless amid rising costs and economic uncertainty, but there is always hope for the future.Supplied

Jessica Moorhouse is a money expert, financial counsellor and author of Everything but Money: The Hidden Barriers Between You and Financial Freedom.

Five years ago, when the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic, I started fielding a barrage of panicked comments, direct messages and e-mails from followers on social media. The inquiries came from people predominantly in their 20s and 30s, and all were asking me what they should do with their money. 

As a money expert who's the same age as her target demo, I was glad to be able to offer some guidance for the questions my peers were asking, however alarmist: Should they pull out all their investments and hoard cash in preparation for the end of days? Should they go all in on crypto because soon traditional currency would become completely worthless? Should they cancel their plans to buy a home in the city and buy land in a small town three hours away so they can finally breathe? What should they do?!

Five years later, I'm starting to get some very similar questions again, and my biggest concern is that Canadians, especially young Canadians, either haven't learned some key lessons from what happened – or worse, they don't care to, and are doomed to repeat the same mistakes. 

Wedding, home ownership, retirement: How to invest for three big life-stage expenses

Rob Carrick: A ‘how much should you worry' guide to stocks, mortgage rates, the dollar and more

For a little background, I'm not just a money expert; I'm also a millennial who is all too familiar with the feeling that the sky is falling. At this point, I'm honestly a bit numb to it. 

It started when my dad narrowly avoided financial ruin by choosing to stick with his stable 9-to-5 tech job instead of joining a startup in 2000. When the dot-com bubble burst, it swiftly swallowed that startup and hundreds more like it. Then, there's the financial crisis that has defined my adult life and those of my fellow millennials: The Great Recession. I graduated from university in 2009, and even though I'm now in my late 30s, it still haunts me. Then a decade later: COVID. And now this: a trade war with our closest ally, with no rules and no stable actor on the other side upon whom we can depend to act rationally.

Just when we've put out one fire, another ignites nearby. There's no safe haven to escape to, no place to relax our shoulders and exhale. It seems there's no hope at all for the future – just endless distractions on our phones that we can scroll through as we sip our expensive lattes, engulfed in flames while we tell ourselves, “This is fine.” Or at least, that is how many young Canadians feel, jumping from one global crisis to another while carrying the baggage of the ever-rising cost of postsecondary education, groceries, rent and real estate.

It's no wonder there is a general sense of malaise when it comes to saving and staying out of debt among Gen Z and the youngest of Gen Y. From their perspective, “Save? What for?” is a valid line of inquiry. 

And I get it. I really do. I felt a similar sense of despair in my 20s, feeling like no matter how much I saved or how “good” I was with my money, I would never catch up to where my parents were at my age – so what was the point in trying? And now with social media showing us videos of young people sipping champagne on yachts, sharing their outrageous shopping hauls or bragging about earning $50,000 a month by selling their course about how to earn $50,000 a month, comparison really is the thief of all joy.

But here's the thing: This feeling of disillusionment is not unique to Generations Y and Z. Almost every cohort of Canadians has had to deal with their own world-on-fire-type crisis. Generation X also entered the work force during a period of economic uncertainty in the 1990s; not only was this era followed by a long period of economic expansion, but we also got grunge music out of it. The Silent Generation lived through both the Great Depression and the Second World War, and I think we can all guess why they were so silent – they saw too much. Nevertheless, they too experienced a long period of economic expansion after the war, commonly referred to as the “Golden Age of Capitalism.” 

And being an elder millennial, I've also seen light after the darkness. The economic expansion that followed The Great Recession was the longest on record until the COVID crash in 2020.

You see, no matter how bad things are, they never stay that way forever. Despite this new period of uncertainty in our relationship with the U.S. and the return of recession talk, even if we're facing a rough couple of years ahead, I'm still hopeful for the future. History has shown us time and time again that what goes down will eventually go back up. Just take a look at the Canadian stock market. After every contraction follows a period of expansion that reaches an even higher peak than the previous one.

But more than that, we need to remind ourselves how resilient we can be in the face of adversity. Because if we Canadians are anything, it's resilient.

This is the underlying theme of my work and why I write about money for young people. No matter what kind of obstacles you face on your financial journey, I truly believe you can overcome them. It may not be easy or straightforward, and you may face more obstacles than others who have inherent privileges that you do not. But nothing is insurmountable as long as you can silence the internal noise, believe in yourself, learn the skills, and most importantly take a good look at your personal relationship with money.

For years as a financial counsellor, I would work with new clients and think that my only job was to help them with their money. That's why they came to me, after all: They wanted to get their finances together, craft a budget, get out of debt and start seeing their net worth go up instead of declining or stagnating. But with every single client, it was never just about the numbers. It was also about the role money played in their personal life and how their unregulated emotions influenced much of their financial behaviours and decision-making.

More often than not, money was a negative presence in their lives. Money always called the shots and made them believe that there was a ceiling to what they could achieve – that no amount of skill or effort could ever change that. 

These beliefs don't come from nowhere. They start in childhood, with that very first interaction with money, and they compound based on the lessons you learned about money growing up, the traumas you experienced or inherited from your ascendants, and, of course, just being a human with an out-of-date operating system incompatible with modern finance, as we all are.

So if you've developed a mindset from a young age that has you believing that the world is going down the toilet, that only the rich get richer, that you'll never be able to elevate your socioeconomic status, and you might as well spend your money freely as if the Earth is about to implode, then that will be your reality.

But what if you're wrong? What if the world isn't going to implode? It's not a bad idea to start saving and investing, while you've got ample time on your side, just in case the world continues to exist by the time you retire. And chances are, it will.

What if rich people aren't the only ones who can get richer? I actually know this to be true because I've seen it. Although it's a heck of a lot easier to build wealth when you already have it, I've worked with a number of clients who started out with a negative net worth, but after a few years of dedicated hard work, were able to achieve a six-figure net worth. It's possible!

What if you are capable of stepping into a higher financial position? For me, this is a rhetorical question, because I know that you absolutely are. You may not be able to see it now, especially if your income-to-expense ratio means there's nothing left after all the bills are paid – and especially if no one in your family has been able to do it before you. But what most people don't realize is that money is about more than just dollars and cents. It's about patience, perseverance, self-confidence and viewing things through a solutions-focused lens while keeping your emotions in check.

I graduated at the height of the Great Recession with a fairly useless film degree, hardly anything in my bank account and a student loan to pay off. After a year of trying to find a job while living in my parents' basement, things were not looking good for me. But one day, my older sister told me about a personal-finance blog she was reading and I decided to check it out. As soon as I started reading this blogger's musings about money in their 20s, I felt seen. I felt heard. I was no longer on an island alone. I then found hope amongst a whole community of people sharing their journeys, offering help and support and lifting each other up, no matter what their starting point was.

Hope is what's carried me through every financial crisis and setback ever since. And hope is what all Canadians, especially young Canadians, need to hold onto to get us through this next roller-coaster ride. Because without hope, what's the alternative?

The plane crashed into a residential building in the western German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. One of the dead is presumed to be the pilot.   

A small passenger plane crashed into a residential building in the western German town of Korschenbroich on Saturday, killing two people, North-Rhine Westphalia police told German media.  

The town is located near the city of Mönchengladbach and is not far from the Dutch border.

According to police, the plane struck the terrace of a building at around 12:30 p.m. (1030 GMT/UTC) and then a fire broke out.

German news agency dpa reported that one of the two people killed was the 71-year-old pilot, citing police.

Police said the pilot was from Düsseldorf and appeared to have been sitting alone in the aircraft.

It wasn't immediately clear whether the other person had been a passenger on the plane or had been on the ground.

Firefighters responded in numbers with the local control center saying that around 50 personnel had been deployed. They managed to douse the flames rapidly.

The cause of the crash has yet to be established.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Trump remittance tax to hit Africans hard","https://www.dw.com/en/trump-remittance-tax-to-hit-africans-hard/a-72695501","Sat, 31 May 2025 05:36:20 GMT","

The US president's much-touted tax bill includes a plan to place significant levies on remittances leaving the country. The impact on migrants and their families will be felt across the world, including Africa.

For Enoch Aikins, a political economist who focuses on Africa, the topic of sending money home to relatives is personal.

""I can use myself as an example, as somebody that comes from a typical village with a lot of people or [with] a family that depends on me,"" he told DW.

A researcher with the Institute of Security Studies now based in Pretoria, South Africa, Aikins grew up in the small town of Agona Kwanyako, about 70 kilometers (some 43 miles) from the Ghanaian capital, Accra.

His job means he can provide a vital source of income for many in his family back home in Ghana, whether it be for his mother's medical bills or for his cousins' education.

""Anytime there's a family problem, they call me and I have to quickly find a way to send money to them to solve an emergency crisis,"" he said. ""Mostly it is household expenses, things like food, accommodation, school fees or to cover medical expenses.""

Aikins is one of many millions of Africans across the continent and around the world who sends remittances, which are financial transfers to their home country or region.

The importance of these financial transfers has come into sharp effect as a result of the recent tax bill from US President Donald Trump, passed on May 22 by the House of Representatives. The measure includes a 3.5% tax on remittances made by anyone who is not a US citizen or national. The original plan was for the tax to be 5% but it was lowered before the vote.

The bill has led to fierce criticism across Latin America, where it is likely to severely hurt poor migrants from Mexico, Central and South America.

Africans will also be significantly affected, according to Aikins. ""We cannot tell them how to go about their fiscal business, but this is going to have a huge impact on African economies.""

World Bank data shows that remittance flows into Africa were more than $92 billion (€81 billion) in 2024, with the United States alone accounting for at least $12 billion in that year.

According to World Bank, the US is also the largest origin country for all remittances in the world, accounting for more than $656 billion in 2023.

Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington D.C., said, however, here is a lack of reliable data on remittances because so much is not sent via recorded transactions.

""People have different arrangements for sending money back home,"" she told DW. ""Sometimes it's as official as a family member comes and visits and then they get a wad of cash and they go back home with that. And those kinds of transactions are simply unaccounted for.""

Nonetheless, whatever data is available, she argued, underlines the importance of the US as a source of remittances for Africa and much of the Americas.

Remittances are important across Africa for three key reasons. Firstly, they represent a major chunk of income for many of the continent's economies, many of which are among the world's poorest.

Recent data suggests annual remittances now outweigh both aid and foreign direct investment (FDI) as income flows into the continent.

Aikins said remittances are the ""largest external financial flow into Africa"" at the moment. ""There are no bottlenecks or administrative issues that, for instance, if you are giving aid of about $100 million to an African country or an institution, more than half is gone on administration before it reaches people,"" he added.

Then there's the fact that it's typically lower-income groups that are most reliant on remittances from relatives or friends working abroad.

""It's extremely damaging,"" said Monica de Bolle. ""A lot of the time, these flows are coming from low-income folks in the United States to their home countries and their families who are also not well off.""

Some African countries will be hit harder than others. While the continent's big economies such as Egypt, Nigeria and Morocco account for the highest total level of remittances from abroad, some economies are especially dependent, according to Aikins.

World Bank data shows that remittances received as a percentage of GDP is around 20% for Lesotho, Comoros, Somalia, Gambia and Liberia.

De Bolle is critical of the remittance levy, and thinks migrants will find ways of avoiding the tax. ""People who are sending money back home, if they were using official channels to do this, they're now going to try to use unofficial channels to do it because they will want to evade the tax.""

She points out that taxation of remittances is rare globally and thinks the policy is part of the Trump administration's campaign against illegal migration.

""The effect will be squeezing the migrants, squeezing the people who are currently living in the United States, shutting off mechanisms by which not only they sustain themselves, but they sustain their family members,"" said Bolle.

""Bottom line is that remittances are a pocketbook issue. You are taking money out of people's pockets.""

Aikins' remittances won't be taxed, as they are not coming from the US. Yet he can clearly imagine the real-life consequences for someone in a village like the one he grew up in who is dependent on a relative sending money from the US.

When he gets a request for money, it's needed quickly, and he thinks migrants will turn increasingly to cryptocurrency and other off-grid methods to send the money where it needs to go.

""The tax is going to have a tremendous effect on how people send money to their dependents back home.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","World Boxing introduces mandatory sex tests for all fighters","https://www.dw.com/en/world-boxing-introduces-mandatory-sex-tests-for-all-fighters/a-72741434","Sat, 31 May 2025 10:24:40 GMT","

The Olympic boxing federation said sex testing is aimed at competitive fairness and safety. The announcement focused directly on Algerian Olympic champion Imane Khelif. 

World Boxing on Friday announced the introduction of mandatory sex tests for both male and female fighters who want to compete in sponsored competitions.

""The introduction of mandatory testing will be part of a new policy on 'Sex, Age and Weight' to ensure the safety of all participants and deliver a competitive level playing field for men and women,"" World Boxing said in a statement.

The federation said it made the decision in the aftermath of controversy centered around, among others, Algerian boxer Imane Khelif at last year's Paris Olympics.

During a knockout round, Khelif's Italian opponent refused to fight her after baselessly claiming Khelif was not a woman because she hit too powerfully. Khelif went on to climb the ladder and win the gold medal.

World Boxing, which has been asked by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to organize the boxing competition for the upcoming 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, says it has informed the Algerian Boxing Federation that Khelif must submit to a sex test before being allowed to compete in the upcoming Eindhoven Box Cup in the Netherlands from June 5-10.

""World Boxing has written to the Algerian Boxing Federation to inform it that Imane Khelif will not be allowed to participate in the female category at the Eindhoven Box Cup or any World Boxing event until Imane Khelif undergoes sex testing,"" read a statement from the world body.

National boxing federations will be required to test and confirm the sex of individual athletes and to provide certification thereof to World Boxing before they are allowed to compete.

The new policy will require all athletes over 18 to undergo a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genetic test before they will be allowed to participate in World Boxing-sanctioned events.

The tests are conducted with a nasal or mouth swab, or with a blood or saliva sample, in order to detect genetically specific material to determine a person's assigned sex at birth.

""The PCR test is a laboratory technique used to detect specific genetic material, in this case the SRY gene, that reveals the presence of the Y chromosome, which is an indicator of biological sex,"" World Boxing said.

World Boxing said that athletes seeking to compete in women's categories will ""be referred to independent clinical specialists for genetic screening, hormonal profiles, anatomical examination or other valuation of endocrine profiles by medical specialists,"" if initial test results show evidence of male chromosomal material.

The new policy also provides the possibility of appeal.

Khelif has announced plans to defend her gold medal at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics and is expected to return to international competition at Eindhoven next week.

""For me, I see myself as a girl, just like any other girl. I was born a girl, raised as a girl, and have lived my entire life as one,"" the champion boxer said back in March.

A soldier careens into the briefing tent of Cross Functional Team (CFT) Taiwan, barely able to catch his breath.

“Attention on the floor!” he shouts. “Sorry to barge in, sir, but you'll want to hear this.”

Chinese ships have begun to cross the Taiwan Strait “with full intention to invade”.

Chaos breaks out in the command centre, where specialists had been outlining recent operations. Sirens blare, soldiers pick up rucksacks, plastic chairs are pushed aside.

Over the tree-line, hostile drones whirr into view. As troops hustle a visiting congressional delegation to an evacuation point, they swoop overhead and drop munitions.

Ear-splitting explosions send plumes of smoke into the air. People fall by the side of the road, screaming.

So begins the long-feared war between the world's two largest militaries – or at least, a drill simulating the event at the 25th capability exercise of the US Special Forces at Fort Bragg army base.

A hint of slapstick lingers in the air. Called upon to help the wounded, visitors fiddle with their lanyards, while fake blood soaks the clothes of gurgling actors.

The scenario, however, is head-poundingly serious.

Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, has ordered his military to be ready to “reunify” the self-governing island of Taiwan with the mainland by 2027.

An extraordinary build-up is under way. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) now boasts one million troops more than the US, as well as the world's largest navy, vast supplies of ground-based long-range missiles and a galloping nuclear arsenal set to hit 1,000 warheads by 2030.

In satellite imagery, a mock-up of central Taipei including the president's office can be seen near a desert PLA base.

Beijing also has home advantage: its resources are all closer to Taiwan than the US bases in the Philippines, Japan and Guam. Any movement of US forces will be immediately spotted by China's extensive sensor network.

Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, warned on Saturday that the threat from China was real and a Chinese invasion of Taiwan could be imminent. He added that any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan “would result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world”.

“Beijing is credibly preparing potentially to use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific,” Mr Hegseth said in a speech to the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's premier defence forum, in Singapore.

In March, Mr Hegseth issued a classified memo that prioritised efforts to deter a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, leaving Europe to “assume risk” in facing down Russia.

“China is the Department's sole pacing threat, and denial of a Chinese fait accompli seizure of Taiwan – while simultaneously defending the US homeland is the Department's sole pacing scenario,” he wrote.

The memo lifted sections almost word-for-word from a report by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington-based think tank.

“If I had to bet they are laying the groundwork now to begin large swings of forces out of lesser-priority theatres to the Indo-Pacific in around six months,” says Rob Peters, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, who co-authored the report.

In Fort Bragg headquarters, a briefing video opens with the sound of a clock ticking ominously. Chinese lettering fills the screen.

Three red stars mark the years 2014 (Russia's seizure of Ukraine), 2022 (the invasion of Ukraine) and 2027 – the year China could strike Taiwan.

The impact of a Chinese invasion on the lives of ordinary people would make that of the Covid pandemic “pale in comparison”, says Lt Gen Jonathan P Braga, the commander of the US Army Special Operations Command.

It would disrupt the supply of the microchips that power crucial technologies, “from I can't buy a car, a refrigerator, a cell-phone… all that stuff”.

“We need people… to think about this, because it is by exponential means the greatest threat we have,” Lt Gen Braga says.

What role ground troops would play is open to question. Around 500 US military trainers are currently based on Taiwan, teaching the local forces how to operate advanced weaponry. The first test with the long-range Himars was carried out this month.

Special forces would likely enter Taiwan surreptitiously in the weeks before an invasion; army units might join, but public deployments could inflame the situation.

The defenders' goal would be to “turn the Taiwan beaches into the beaches of Normandy,” says Mr Peters. Failing that: “box them in like Anzio.”

But the fiercest battles will be fought in the skies and at sea. The US is preparing a “hellscape” of drones, mines and unmanned ships to slow down China's crossing of the 100-mile Taiwan Strait.

The PLA navy will form a blockade around the eastern flank of the island, preventing the US from reaching or resupplying the Taiwanese.

Spectacular dogfights would erupt: US F-35s, bombers and stealth B-21 raiders attempting to sink the warships, as China's 3,000 aircraft fight back.

Recommended

To stand a chance, the US will need “a metric s--- ton” of long-range anti-ship missiles, in particular the new Tomahawk, which has a range of 1,500 miles, says Mr Peters. “I cannot stress this enough,” he adds, the arsenal is currently “way, way [too] low.”

One goal of the special forces – however many they number – would be to try and open up air corridors onto the island.

Out on a Fort Bragg training range, a dozen camouflaged soldiers creep through the trees towards a Russian-made Scud missile and nearby command-and-control centre, which form part of China's Integrated Air Defence System (IADS).

To the south of their position, a drone-operator, robot dog and two armoured vehicles mounted with M240b machine guns wait for the signal. Snipers watch behind camouflage.

“Open fire,” the commander orders over the radio. A drone whizzes overhead, dropping a bomb near the Scud. The M240b gunners spray the guards, providing cover for the soldiers to race out of the trees and eliminate those left alive.

The Scud is disabled with a flamethrower (its unique fuel makes explosive detonation tricky).

Then comes the most novel element of the exercise: as Chinese drones launch a counter-attack, an Anduril electronic warfare system breaks the link between the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and their pilots. The special forces team survives and a “temporary air corridor” is opened.

Whether Beijing's real drones would be so simply overcome is another question.

“There is an assumption that China has been observing [the war in Ukraine, where Chinese drones have been used en masse] and that their ability to ramp up capacity now appears to be better than the US and Nato's ability to produce these systems,” says Colin Smith, a Rand Corp. researcher and Marine veteran.

It can be difficult even to train with the systems on US soil. Electronic warfare systems interfere with nearby residents' garages. On Camp Pendleton, in California, Mr Smith's team was unable to practise with the jammers they used in Afghanistan “because of the electromagnetic spectrum limitations”.

“Those are things that the Department of Defense is trying to work through on certain bases,” he says.

Homeland defence is the most pressing problem. China's intercontinental ballistic missiles can now strike the US mainland. In May, US Air Force Brig Gen Dough Wickert warned locals around Edwards Air Force Base that a Pearl Harbour-like scenario could hit their Californian homes.

Donald Trump's solution is the Golden Dome, a network of space-based interceptors he claims – unfeasibly – could be finished within three years for a cost of “just” $175 billion.

In war games on Taiwan, China does often hit the US mainland, says Mr Smith. “What if they want to hit the west coast and get the American population thinking, ‘why are we doing this again'?”

Mark Cancian, a retired Marine colonel and senior advisor at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), ran a 2023 war game on an amphibious invasion. Over 24 run-throughs, the US managed to prevent China capturing the island most times, but at the cost of dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft and tens of thousands of service-members.

The US still needs to decide its position on how and when ground troops will enter the fray, Mr Cancian says. “When you talk to the services, to the Marine corps, they say ‘well of course we're going to be on Taiwan when the war begins'. But the state department says ‘there's no f---ing way', as that will precipitate the conflict we're trying to avoid.”

In one round of the war game, a player tried to fly a US brigade into Taiwan. But they turned back after they lost a battalion to air defences. “After four, five weeks of combat, when the Chinese fleet has been chewed up, [perhaps] then you can start doing things,” he says. Sometimes, nuclear war erupts.

Such hypotheticals are above the pay grade of the soldiers who will be called upon to fight in Taiwan's jungles, cities and beaches should war break out.

On an urban training village in Fort Bragg, two Chinook MH47 helicopters fly a platoon of elite Rangers into battle. The soldiers rappel down ropes onto the roofs, while the helicopters rattle out machine gun rounds.

Doors are stormed through, flash-bang grenades thrown as the unit rapidly clears the buildings.

High above their heads, a single Himars missile streaks through the sky. Here, it will land safely on a patch of Fort Bragg, guided to within 1m of the intended target.

The US hopes it will never come to war with China. Mr Xi may well think twice, wary of a long and costly conflict. If he does gamble, however, the Green Berets will no longer be practising on the fields of North Carolina – and those Himars missiles will be raining down on an army tasting its first real combat.

An estimated 250 million bees are on the loose in the US state of Washington after a lorry carrying beehives rolled over on Friday.

Authorities reported that a commercial lorry carrying 70,000lbs of pollinator beehives overturned in the town of Lynden, five miles south of the border with Canada, allowing 250 million bees to make their escape.

“250 million bees are now loose,” the Whatcom county sheriff's department posted on social media.

“AVOID THE AREA due to the potential of bee escape and swarming.”

More than two dozen beekeepers assisted emergency responders – some of whom were stung – with recapturing the bees, a spokesman for the sheriff's department told local media.

The swarm of bees was so dense, it was “like a cloud”, Derek Condit, one of the beekeepers, told local media.

“It was pretty chaotic.”

Some of the beekeepers were reportedly stung over a dozen times and were using tape to plug holes in their suits.

“I've never had that many bees – angry bees – at one time,” said Russell Deptuch, another local beekeeper, in an interview with local media.

The lorry was on its way to the US state of South Dakota when it rolled over early on Friday morning.

However, it was a botched rescue mission several hours later which ultimately caused the mass flight as a tow truck attempted to pull the vehicle out of a ditch, causing the hives to fall off.

“Unfortunately, that didn't happen as smoothly as was hoped, and some of the beehives broke open, which caused all the bees to swarm, which is how we're in the situation we're in now,” said Matt Klein, the deputy director of the division of emergency management for the sheriff's department, in a statement.

The aim of the recovery operation is to save as many bees as possible and allow them to re-hive and find their queen, which the sheriff's department estimated would take one or two days.

Although there is a large number of bees needing to be recaptured, the insects are social and drawn to their hives, meaning they are likely to stay near the truck.

“That's where their queen and the next generation of bees (the ‘brood') are located,” Gene Robinson, a professor of entomology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told The New York Times.

Each hive tends to contain between 40,000 and 60,000 bees, Mr Robinson said.

As of Friday afternoon, the beekeepers and emergency responders had restored most of the hives, and the majority of the insects are expected to return by Saturday morning, the sheriff's department said.

Until then, the road has been closed and the public advised to stay at least 200 yards from the area.

Joe Biden has revealed he's “very optimistic” about his cancer diagnosis, saying he's “going to be able to beat this”.

In his first public appearance since being diagnosed with prostate cancer, Mr Biden said he feels good and is working with a leading surgeon.

“The prognosis is good. We're working on everything. It's moving along and I feel good. All the folks are very optimistic,” the former US president told reporters after making a speech at a Memorial Day service in Delaware.

Mr Biden, 82, revealed he has started taking medication to treat his cancer. “It's a matter of taking a pill, one particular pill for the next six weeks and then another one,” he said.

“The expectation is we're going to be able to beat this. There's no cancer in any organ, my bones are strong, it hadn't penetrated.”

Mr Biden said he was working with “one of the leading surgeons in the world”, adding that the doctor had received the same diagnosis 32 years ago and is “alive and well”.

The former president appeared in good spirits during the event on Saturday, although he coughed several times throughout his speech. His wife, Jill, kept a low profile. 

Mrs Biden, who has been under intense scrutiny following the publication of a book which claimed her husband's declining mental state was covered up during his time in the White House, stayed under the radar.

The book, Original Sin, by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, painted a picture of Mrs Biden silencing critics and rising to become “one of the most powerful first ladies in history,” managing the White House behind the scenes.

The couple have in recent months presented a united front, posing for a selfie together with their cat Willow, following the announcement of Mr Biden's cancer, and joining the hosts of The View for a joint interview.

The controversial View interview ruffled some feathers, with Mrs Biden accused of speaking over her husband, finishing his sentences, and secretly communicating with him to stop speaking.

Although the couple were pictured arriving at Veterans Memorial Park, Newcastle, on Friday, Mrs Biden was nowhere to be seen as her husband stepped behind the podium.

She also did not appear to be sitting in the front few rows when he stepped away to sit back down. In other similar public appearances Mrs Biden has stood or sat nearby her husband, often greeting him once off-stage.

Giving an impassioned speech, Mr Biden paid tribute to his late son Beau, who died of brain cancer 10 years ago.

“This day is the 10th anniversary of the loss of my son Beau, who spent a year in Iraq. And to be honest, it's a hard day,” he said.

“Being with all of you, quite frankly, makes things a little bit easier, it really does. So, thank you for allowing me to grieve with you,” he said.

Mr Biden also applauded the US armed forces, and those who died in action.

“Folks, every year we come together to remember, to remember, to remember the brave women and men who gave their all for this nation, or as Lincoln called it, the last full measure of devotion.

“That's what it was, the last full measure of devotion. They laid down their lives so we could live our lives in peace,” he said.

“Only around one per cent of all Americans defend 99 per cent of us,” he added. “Just one per cent of Americans risk the ultimate sacrifice. We owe them so much more than we can ever repay them.”

Despite his diagnosis of late-stage prostate cancer, the 82-year-old former president appeared more forceful and vigorous than he had been in a while, particularly more-so than when he was the Democratic candidate, before being replaced by Kamala Harris.

Claims that it was Mrs Biden who orchestrated the alleged cover-up of her husband's mental and physical decline show no sign of evaporating.

The White House stepped into the fray with Karoline Leavitt, Mr Trump's press secretary, launching a personal attack on Mrs Biden.

“Frankly, the former first lady should certainly speak up about what we saw in regard to her husband and when she saw it and what she knew,” Ms Leavitt said.

“Because I think anybody looking, again, at the videos and photo evidence of Joe Biden with your own eyes and a bit of common sense can see this is a clear cover-up and Jill Biden was definitely complacent in that cover-up.”

She added: “They were just on The View last week. She was saying everything is fine. She's still lying to the American people. She still thinks the American public are so stupid ... And frankly, it's insulting and she needs to answer for it.”

Louisiana isn't just passing bad policy. It's laying bricks in a pathway toward fascism.

Louisiana isn't just passing bad policy. It's laying bricks in a pathway toward fascism — and elected officials are doing it in broad daylight.

This legislative session, lawmakers in Baton Rouge have been advancing a uniquely harsh combination of anti-immigrant bills. As someone who organizes at the intersections of immigrant justice, racial equity and decarceration, I need people to understand that what's happening here isn't about immigration. It's about control, surveillance and criminalizing compassion.

Consider Senate Bill 15, introduced by Republican State Sen. Jay Morris. This critical bill had a hearing in the House Administration of Criminal Justice Committee on May 28. If passed, it would amend state obstruction of justice and malfeasance in office laws to criminalize any public official or private individual who commits “any act intended to hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere with” federal immigration enforcement. That could mean refusing to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). That could mean advocating for a sanctuary city. That could mean doing your job with integrity — and getting charged with a felony. Public employees could face charges for refusing “lawful requests for cooperation” from agencies like ICE, Customs and Border Protection or U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The law would take effect August 1, 2025, if signed into law.

SB 15 mirrors “anti-sanctuary” laws in states like Florida and Texas that compel cooperation with ICE that the federal government often cannot constitutionally demand directly under the 10th Amendment's anti-commandeering doctrine.

Or take House Bill 554, sponsored by Republican State Rep. Dixon McMakin of Baton Rouge. This bill had a hearing in the Senate Transportation, Highways, and Public Works Committee on May 29, and its path forward is now more defined. This bill would mandate a specific, yet undefined, “restriction code” be placed on state IDs and driver's licenses issued to lawfully present noncitizens — people legally residing here like refugees, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients or visa holders, who are already ineligible for licenses if undocumented. It also requires the state mail these individuals an official notice warning them against attempting to vote, a felony offense. This marking might as well say: “second-class human.”

Functionally, HB 554's restriction code acts like the passbooks of apartheid South Africa or the badges forced upon marginalized groups throughout history. It is a state-mandated tool designed to mark, differentiate and control a specific population, making discrimination against them easier and reinforcing their “otherness.” This marking is distinct from federal REAL ID standards and targets the legally present, not for federal identification purposes, but purely based on noncitizen status.

And these are just two of several bills in a slate targeting immigrants this session. Other critical bills include:

In my role at the Louisiana Organization for Refugees and Immigrants (LORI), I've heard from families terrified to go to work or school. As political action chair for the NAACP in Baton Rouge and across the state, I see the same story play out over and over — criminalization of existence, wrapped in the language of “law and order.” LORI and other advocates have been actively opposing these measures.

Let me say this plainly: Immigration enforcement is a pillar of the carceral state. It is not broken; it is functioning exactly as designed. These bills weaponize that system further, deputizing local governments into the hands of federal repression. They turn teachers, social workers and public servants into potential enforcers under threat of state criminal charges like malfeasance if they refuse to comply. They target Black and Brown communities with surgical precision.

This is not about “border security.” Louisiana doesn't have a border with Mexico. This is about sending a message: If you're not white, not wealthy, not silent — you are expendable. These aren't isolated acts; they reflect a national playbook pushed by anti-immigrant groups seeking to implement a harsh agenda state by state, using places like Louisiana as testing grounds.

And harsh legislation is not the only thing that distinguishes Louisiana from other states on immigration: It's where ICE has incarcerated many university scholars and pro-Palestine organizers, including Mahmoud Khalil.

I write this not just as an organizer but as a survivor. I've known what it feels like to be discarded by the state, to be failed by every institution that was supposed to protect me. That's why I fight. That's why I speak. And that's why I will never comply with policies that ask us to betray each other to survive.

When the state seeks to criminalize broadly defined “interference” with federal enforcers while simultaneously marking the identity documents of legally present residents based on citizenship, it lays down bricks of control, surveillance and dehumanization — key elements of authoritarianism.

There is another way. One rooted in care, not cages; in sanctuary, not surveillance; in solidarity, not silence. But we won't get there by being polite. We get there by resisting. By organizing. By calling this what it is: state violence.

Louisiana is a testing ground. If these bills are enacted here, they will be copied across the country. But if we stop them here — if we rise up, call them out and demand something better — we can set a new precedent: that community is not a crime, dignity is not negotiable, and we will not comply.

A new book offers an inside look at incarceration at Rikers Island, from intake to release.

This article has been excerpted from City Time: On Being Sentenced to Rikers Island, published by NYU Press.

Since 1964, the predominant site of city time for men in New York City has been the C-76 building, short for its original city budgetary designation as “Capital Project Number 76.” Alongside its numeric designation, C-76 was first dubbed the New York City Reception and Classification Center, then the Correctional Institution for Men, and is known today as the Eric M. Taylor Center (EMTC). Among COs and inmates, it is usually called “the Six building” or simply “the Six.” The grounds of this low-slung facility sprawl horizontally across thirty acres on the southwest side of the island, near the primary staff parking lot and the mouth of the bridge connecting Rikers to East Elmhurst, Queens. Its facade is brick dappled with shades of beige and brown and punctuated by steel-framed windows, slatted with seven panes of grubby glass that open obliquely, like vents, with the laborious rotations of an inmate-operated hand crank. C-76 is comprised of three sections, the North Side and the South Side, which opened in 1964, and the Annex, which opened in 1970. The North Side contains two floors of traditional cell blocks, four in total, boasting 136 cells. This is the kind of special accommodation afforded to “protective custody” inmates like Lil Wayne, who spent eight months there in 2010.

The vast majority of the building's approximately 1,850 beds, however, are spread across twenty-eight rectangular dormitories, massive open rooms with stationary single beds, connected to the main building only on one side. This so-called chevron design gives the building the distinct aerial shape of three Ks, with two joined back-to-back by the number eight. These dormitories are identified by a number from one through twelve, denoting distinct three-story structures emanating from the building, along with the level (lower, main, or upper). 12-Main, for instance, is stacked between 12-Lower and 12-Upper, and overlooks 11-Lower, 11-Main, and 11-Upper across a disused courtyard. From many dormitories and passageways of C-76, prisoners may gaze at the Manhattan skyline, the comings and goings of nearby LaGuardia Airport, and the vanishing point where the Buono Bridge connects Rikers to the freedom of the outside world.

C-76 is a building of long corridors of polished tile, concrete, and glazed block, connecting dormitories with a high-school-style cafeteria, cage-lined infirmary, institutional chapel, visiting area, mailroom, disused recreation gymnasium, basement barber shop, and other spaces for sustaining and reproducing the jail. The hallways are streaked with a red line on either side, creating a narrow passage close to the wall, to which inmates are supposed to confine themselves. When moving in supervised groups, they are instructed to cling to the right-hand side of the hall, a behavior that quickly becomes second nature. Multiple checkpoints, complete with metal detectors and sometimes locked doors, stretch the passage from one end of the jail to the other, though these are often abandoned and most inmates are free to roam the halls without restraints or accompaniment, provided they can account for their destination if asked.

“If you grow up in the projects and the public school system and then go to Rikers Island, it almost feels like no big deal. It feels like, oh, we know this setting. I'm willing to bet that the same architect designed all three things,” explains hip-hop artist Fat Joe in Rikers: An Oral History. Fat Joe would absolutely win that bet, at least when it comes to C-76: its architecture firm, Brown & Guenther, also designed a number of public schools and housing projects in the Bronx and throughout the city. This is also a common sentiment expressed by those familiar with the island. “It wasn't until I worked in a jail setting that I realized the … colors on the walls were the same colors used in the hallways and stairwells in the projects,” writes former Rikers CO C. René West. “A color I would call institutional gray, drab yellow, or drab yellow and orange colors. The floor areas in jails are very similar to the lobby areas in many of the project apartment buildings; and the inmate's housing areas have the same tiles on the floor.” Working as CO, West came to suspect that the message this architecture sent to inmates from New York City's housing projects was, “Welcome home.”

The lion's share of city time at C-76 plays out in its dormitories. The dormitories of its Annex, typical of the facility, measure 72.5 by 50 feet, and feature space for sixty-four beds. At the entrance to the dormitory sits a narrow hallway gated on both sides by heavy doors meshed with weathered iron. The so-called A gate leads outside, while the “B gate” leads into the house. This hallway contains a storage closet and the COs' private bathroom, both of which are usually locked. Situated on one side of the entrance hallway is the day room, a small metal- and plexiglass-enclosed common area open in the daytime, where inmates can watch television, play games, eat meals, or, in some dorms, simply sit at a proper table and chair. On the other side is the bathroom. In some houses, semi-opaque plexiglass and metal grating provide only partial privacy for the inmates' bathroom, showers and all. At the mouth of this hallway is the COs' station, commonly called “the Bubble,” an enclosure best compared to a toll booth. There the so-called A officer engages with inmates from behind plexiglass, fielding requests for razors, ibuprofen, toilet paper, and permission to leave the dormitory, along with episodic romantic attention, while the “B officer” holds court at a small table set up just in front, on the floor of the dorm.

Beyond the Bubble and into the depths of the dormitory stretches Broadway, a six-foot-wide corridor bisecting C-76's rectangular barracks. On either side of Broadway sit rows of rusted iron bed frames, four to each side, situated roughly three feet apart and bolted to the floor. Their harsh surface is evenly dotted with ventilation (or drainage) holes; a low lip around its perimeter keeps the mattress in place. Narrow aisles branching off Broadway create sections of eight beds apiece, with roughly five feet in the middle, which often becomes social space with an explicit sense of community, including hostility to outsiders. In some houses, a low divider provides a modicum of privacy between the heads and feet of respective beds, but there is in any case little privacy to be had in the dormitories where city time is served. “Here is the somber monotony of a world created to lock up everything with security, suspicion and certitude,” wrote former Rikers chaplain Pierre Raphael, “to put everything in boxes and pigeonholes, far removed from every kind of fantasy or initiative.”

David spent most of his time at C-74, the Robert N. Davoren Center (RNDC), which has primarily functioned since its 1972 opening as an adolescent facility. Though just across the street, C-74, which dwarfs C-76, stretching across fifty acres to its immediate east, might as well be a world away. Like C-76, it is a building of chevrons and long corridors, and from the outside, largely resembles C-76: three stories of nondescript brick in “warm buff color” and endless rows of steel-frame louvered windows. This facility has two central wings, emanating in an obtuse V shape from a cluster of support facilities, thirteen-hundred feet in each direction. When it opened in 1972, RNDC counted 1,080 cells and a single dormitory. In the early 1980s, DOC added 300 beds in three “module” (or “mod”) dormitories that stretched across the chevrons, along with 108 cells.

RNDC is generally known as “the Four building” or simply “the Four.” But, confusingly, the chevron-shaped wings projecting from the main hallway are known in C-74 jargon as “buildings.” Thus, an inmate in C-74 may speak of “the Six building,” meaning the chevron-shaped wing of C-74 bearing this number, only to have the person he is speaking to interpret this as C-76, which is another facility entirely. The same problem arises with “the Five building,” as this is both a wing in C-74 and a nickname for AMKC, or C-95, another facility on Rikers. To avoid this confusion, inmates in C-74 who are acquainted with the problem will sometimes refer to the other two facilities using the “C,” as in “C-76,” rather than simply “the Six” or “the Six building.”

Each “building” in C-74 has a north side and a south side, designated by those names. They each have three floors, meaning that people in C-74 speak of housing units such as “6–Upper North,” or “6–Upper South,” “4–Main South,” “4–Lower North,” and so on. The two arms of the V-shaped main RNDC structure itself are likewise referred to as “North Side” and “South Side,” despite their intersecting at an almost- right angle. The North Side contains buildings 2, 4, and 6, and Mods 4 and 6. The South Side contains buildings 1, 3, and 5, as well as Mod 5. The 1 building was closed during David's time in C-74, and housed no inmates. The mods are essentially giant two-story trailers joined to the main hallway by a short corridor with a gate. The mods contain four dorms of approximately fifty beds — Mod 4–Lower North has forty-eight beds, and Mod 4–Lower South, fifty.

Most of the spaces designed for functions other than warehousing humans can be found at the crux of the North Side and the South Side. Here, a three-way intersection is closed off by a series of gates operated by a CO in a plexiglass control booth, from which a red light can be seen flashing during C-74's daily occurrence of “alarms.” This booth affords a view down both main hallways as well as toward the shorter hallway from which emanate the DOC staff area, social-services office, clinic, visiting floor (including a blind-turn staircase that has allegedly been the site of many stabbings and slashings over the years), Intake, and kitchen. The North Side, where David was held, affords access to the kitchen, or “KK,” mail room, chapel, and upstairs gym, the staircase descending to the “Peace Center,” downstairs gym and yard, video-visiting/remote-court center, office of the captain on duty, commissary, and mess hall. The South Side hallway affords entrances to the chaplains' offices and the law library.

We learned that rules and policies were selectively enforced, and often just made up, depending on the day and the CO in charge.

Surfaces are largely the same in C-74 as they are in C-76: the walls in the main halls are made of the same glazed block, coated in eggshell enamel. The floor is also polished concrete, and also bears a bright red line running parallel to the wall with a few feet's worth of distance between the two, across which inmates are instructed not to walk when moving to and from the housing units. The walls have a handful of uncaulked seams large enough for rats to crawl through. They bear the occasional feeble attempt at inspiration via thoroughly uninspiring murals: a child behind barbed wire reaching for an enormous butterfly, a formerly incarcerated man going to college and becoming a suit-toting professional, and even an abstract splatter-paint work. Every seventy-five feet or so on the walls of the main hallway, a warning appears, stenciled in black block letters:

ATTENTION ALL INMATES

DONT SUBJECT YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO ARREST

BY ASKING THEM TO SMUGGLE

DRUGS OR CONTRABAND INTO THE FACILITY

C-74's buildings contain cell blocks, not dorms, but otherwise strongly resemble the wings of C-76. The mods are completely different from the buildings. Entering Mod 4 from the main hall, one passes through a double door that can be locked, but rarely is, and then immediately encounters a barred black metal gate. Beyond this sits “the bridge,” the empty landing-like space in front of the Bubble and between the two dorms on either side. An inmate must get the attention of the Bubble officer, usually by yelling “On the gate!” or simply “Yo, CO!” to get the gate open, as it is controlled from inside the Bubble.

The outer surface of the Bubble is equipped with a small black scanning device so inmates can scan their ID wristbands upon entering or exiting the dorms. The door to each dorm has a plexiglass window, perhaps two and a half feet square. Entering the dorm, one finds the day room straight across, along with the “day room corner” section, a stretch of perhaps ten bunks in the front of the dorm, running from the entrance to the day room along the concrete block wall separating it from the main space of the dorm. There are also two small columns here, which provide some relative degree of privacy for certain bunks and from certain angles — about as good as privacy gets in this environment.

The columns, like the walls of Mod 4, are clad in rough white plastic paneling, likely PVC, held together at regular intervals by flat white plastic seams and round button-like fasteners, a sort of tamper-resistant plastic rivet. This is a far cry from any surface in C-76, or the original C-74 structures. The windows, too, are remarkably different — unlike the louvered windows present elsewhere, these are actual sliding windows with heavy-duty metal screens and diamond-pattern metal grates, commonly referred to as “bars.”

Turning away from the day room to look down the length of the dorm, one finds the bulk of the sleeping space: one line of bunks along the inner wall, which separates the sleeping space from the bathroom, and another along the outer wall, prized for its windows. One bed in particular, “the corner bed,” sits in the far corner of the outer wall and the short end wall capping the length of the dorm. This bed is unanimously accepted as the dorm's best real estate, as it has no neighbor on one side, as well as two windows.

On the opposite end of the real-estate social scale are the “Broadway beds”: a double row of bunks running head-to-toe down the middle of the dorm, between the two lines of wall beds. “Sleeping on Broadway” is largely reviled because one has practically no space to call one's own. The mod bathrooms offer slightly more privacy than those in EMTC, but only thanks to the inmates' creative reappropriation of the environment. Yet as a rule, personal space is all but nonexistent. This is the case because city time is a world of forced sociality, whether the inmate likes it or not.

It was a bout of short-stay incarceration that inspired Jamaican musician Toots Hibbert to pen the song “54–46 That's My Number.” In it, Hibbert reflects both on his own experience with incarceration and on the profound realization that, at the exact moment he is singing, someone else stands in his state-issued shoes. “54–46 was my number,” Hibbert croons, “right now, someone else has that number.” As our own experiences with city time recede into the past, and increasingly take on the contours of a strange and awful dream, we must emphasize that the subject matter of this book is being lived by real people as we write, and, barring the creation of a liberated society free from human cages, as you read it. Every morning the lights come on, and every night they go off. All the while, the boundless complexities of human sociality play out within the harsh confines of grubby concrete walls. Rikers Island is, after all, a 24/7 operation. Short-stay incarceration most often sends people back to the streets within a few months, but city time never stops.

City time begins with intake, when the new inmate is processed into the jail. Intake is found in many institutions, including workplace training for new hires in almost every occupation and orientation for new students at universities. The particular type of orientation that takes place in jail, however, is characterized by the surrender of legally recognized freedom, the inculcation of a new set of statutes and customs to replace those in the outside world, and, above all, the violent compulsion — usually just below the surface, but sometimes overt — to accept one's place in this new order.

Sociologist Erving Goffman evoked the medieval concept of civiliter mortuus to describe the intake process as the moment of “civil death,” when a person forfeits the formal rights of an ordinary citizen and becomes a prisoner. New arrivals undergo a process of “loss and mortification”; they are stripped of their outside possessions, including their street clothing and personal grooming equipment, are issued a number that will be more significant than their name, and are issued Spartan institutional clothing and grooming supplies to replace those they use on the outside. Also lost is the emotional comfort that comes from items representing free life on the outside. “The admission procedure can be characterized as a leaving off and a taking on,” Goffman writes, “with the midpoint marked by physical nakedness.” The free person is thus stripped down, literally and figuratively, and established as an inmate.

Central to intake is what Goffman calls “the welcome,” a process in which “staff or inmates, or both, go out of their way to give the recruit a clear notion of his plight.” Beside the supposedly practical matters associated with intake — searching for contraband, ascertaining medical history, providing a uniform, outlining the rules, and so forth — there is an equally if not more important process of communicating to newcomers that they are now living in a place where they are insignificant and powerless. Inmates are made to understand that most of the liberties even a working-class person can enjoy on the outside are suspended, and that they should therefore follow the rules and avoid causing trouble in order to simply survive. This message has many carriers: the harsh architecture and filthy neglect of the intake pens, the humiliating process of the strip search, the endless waiting and unapologetic inefficiency of the whole process, and, of course, the verbal instructions and advice offered by COs and inmates alike.

In our experience, while COs may inform new arrivals of what is expected of them, mostly through threats, insults, or scarcely comprehensible commands, the inmates themselves take a more active role in orienting newcomers to the social setting where they will cohabitate. The first process is the institutional intake, the official mechanisms through which newcomers are taken into the facility, in Goffman's words, “to be shaped and coded into an object that can be fed into the administrative machinery of the establishment, to be worked on smoothly by routine operations.” But equally important, and largely neglected by Goffman, is what we call the social intake, in which other inmates acculturate and acclimatize the newcomer to the de facto social order structuring inmate life.

Given that we both had the privilege of posting bail, and thus began our city time directly from the outside, this is how our narrative is framed. From what we gather, however, the intake process is similar for those already housed on the island prior to conviction, including the forfeiture of street clothing and other small benefits of innocence in the eyes of the law, and the new inmate's subsequent processing into the distinct world of city time.

The judge is clad in a black robe and ensconced in polished wood paneling, just like on television. But in real life, the scene is much shabbier. It is hard not to notice the run-down furniture, dirty windows, and wrinkled vestments of the judge sneering down from a bench propped up higher than everything else in the courtroom save for the bold, gilded words embossed above the judge's head: “In God We Trust.” Beside the judge's venerable bench sits an ominous door leading from the contrived civility of the courtroom to the world of human cages. Burly COs clad in unnecessary bulletproof vests patrol this portal, ferrying captive people from the jail, a world of unvarnished violence and neglect, to the courtroom, where brute force appears cloaked in the highest Enlightenment ideals.

By the time we crossed this threshold, we had eyed it with morbid fascination in dozens of grueling and often pointless court appearances. Passing through this door, we began our city time. We started out in a set of “pens,” the colloquial term for cages of different sizes, often filthy and lacking basic facilities like sinks and toilets, where prisoners languish for hours on end at nearly every step of their movement through DOC custody. Jarrod was shuttled into a small, dilapidated cell with a disused bathroom overlooking Manhattan rooftops. The CO processing him was training a trio of cadets, and used Jarrod to demonstrate the proper methods of searching a detained person for weapons. He explained that they should always be polite and respectful. “Some court officers make fun of me for being polite to prisoners,” he added, “but my philosophy is you say please — once.” The cadets nodded eagerly.

We were questioned at length about our professions, medical histories, and gang affiliations. The COs processing Jarrod, a Latino man, and two Black women, joked that it was not too late for him to join a gang before he got to Rikers. “Now is a good time to get covered,” one of the women told him. Jarrod asked if they had a form for that. The man threw up gang signs with his hands while the two women laughed. Meanwhile, the man chewed on cherries, throwing the pits on the floor. One of the women yelled at him, saying he was feeding the mice. Picking them up would be the responsibility of inmates bused in from Rikers Island.

This process was a rush from one filthy pen to another, with broken toilets, clogged sinks, and nowhere to sit or lie down without great discomfort, just to wait for hours on end before being transported to another. As we lost track of time, it dawned on us that it no longer mattered. We were patted down and asked the same questions over and over again as we changed custody from one cluster of COs to another, slowly making our way to the ground floor of 100 Center Street, through a series of elevator rides in which we were commanded to face the back wall. Amid the squalor and stale air of the sunless pens, and the still more dismal gloom of detained men headed to Rikers and the state prison system, a small, home-printed sign hung over one guard station bearing the words, “The worst prison of all is fear of what other people think.”

Jarrod was escorted toward the bus by an East Asian male CO. A white male CO playfully shouted, “Why are you messing with the white guy?” Jarrod's escort replied, “I have to, for our numbers. It can't just be Black and Latino guys in here!” Such banter between COs sometimes uses the inmate as the butt of a joke, but usually ignores the inmate altogether. In transit, COs often stopped and talked among themselves as if we were inanimate objects — a sentiment further betrayed by their frequent reference to us as “packages.”

Reaching the ground floor at last, we entered a short corridor leading into a foul-smelling outdoor loading dock stacked high with clear plastic trash bags containing unfinished detainee meals, allowing a narrow path alongside an idling DOC transport bus for us to board. These buses resembled heavily armored school buses, with metal grating over the windows, one row of double-seater pens along the left-hand side, and another row of single cages along the right. Jarrod traveled with a group of women from the Rose M. Singer Center, the women's jail on Rikers, who had been transported to 100 Center Street to work. “Hurry up and get us on the bus before a rat jump out!” one commanded the CO overseeing their transfer. The overpowering smell of garbage boarded the bus along with the passengers, and never left.

Worn and rusted metal doors and locks jangled incessantly as the bus bounced around the sinuous Lower Manhattan streets. Outside, New York City street life went on as usual, with nobody paying particular attention to what is, after all, a very common sight. Jarrod was transported in June, and the heat was stifling. The bus crawled across gridlocked Chinatown streets for upwards of fifteen minutes, making its way east to Bowery in stop-and-go traffic, only to loop around and return to the loading dock in a similar crawl. One of the COs had forgotten something. “CO, turn on the air conditioning!” one inmate yelled. Laughing, the CO replied that there was no air conditioner, and while the women had “grounds for a civil rights lawsuit,” they would have to wait until its success in court to get their justice. The atmosphere was convivial. These were people who clearly spent a lot of time with each other.

Jarrod's bus crawled through the Lower East Side in search of the elusive “better way” across Manhattan in midday traffic. There was much grumbling by inmates and COs alike, including one woman exclaiming, “Where are all these people going at two o'clock in the afternoon?” — a phrase Jarrod had heard hundreds of times in his years of work as a New York City truck driver. At last the bus reached the United Nations building and entered the Midtown Tunnel to Queens. The bus then traversed a maze of industrial streets heading toward East Elmhurst. David's driver, in contrast, opted for the Manhattan Bridge and made much better time.

A noxious smell hit Jarrod's nostrils, and one of the women on his bus exclaimed excitedly, “Oh, we home!” an instant before the bus turned the corner and revealed the entrance to the Rikers Island Bridge. The bridge itself is a mile-long span with a slight elevation in the center that jolts passengers momentarily off their seats at the midpoint. Meanwhile, on the right sits LaGuardia Airport, so close to Rikers that its runways practically touch the island, with Citi Field, home of the Mets, looming behind it in the distance. “We're home!” other women on Jarrod's bus reiterated, cheering, upon reaching the other side of the bridge.

The intake area at C-76 (“Intake”) features much of the same dirty and decrepit pens one finds throughout the chain of custody in the city's punishment system. Jarrod was uncuffed and herded into one pen with a putrid, unflushable toilet and a sleeping man whose tray of food, stripped only of its meat, was being devoured by a swarm of flies. A gentle sea breeze wafted in through windows covered in rusted iron grating and overgrown with greenery on the outside, emitting the smell of salt water, vegetation, and morning dew that permeates the island's windows to battle in vain with the odors of sweat, feet, piss, shit, burps, farts, and bleach that otherwise dominate the atmosphere.

Next, we turned our money over by feeding it into an electronic machine that resembled a MetroCard dispenser, got photographed, and turned over our civilian clothing, including our shoes. We were then ordered to strip to our underwear and hover above a BOSS chair, which looks a bit like a drugstore blood pressure machine but can supposedly identify metal contraband stored in the anus and mouth. We were then led into a small booth, open on one side, and told to remove our underwear and squat down, exposing our anuses. The male COs who oversee strip searches at Rikers fiercely guard their masculinity by performing shock and revulsion at the sight of male penises and anuses, which must in reality be quite routine sights to them after only a few days on the job. The muscular, heavily tattooed white male CO inspecting Jarrod barked an inaudible command, which Jarrod incorrectly interpreted to mean “spread your ass wider.” When Jarrod did this, he learned that the CO had meant the opposite. “OK! OK!” he shouted, as if in great physical pain, “You're done!”

The visual inspection of the anus does not actually reveal any contraband unless the new arrival has been very careless in stashing it, and is thus far more about the performance of guard vigilance and inmate subservience than anything practical. Sociologist Harold Garfinkle called these rituals “status degradation ceremonies,” performances in which the subordinate position of a class of people, in this case newly arrived inmates, is inscribed and repeatedly emphasized. Incidentally, these searches are notoriously futile at Rikers; we were both reproached by several men in the intake dormitory for knowingly turning ourselves in to custody without contraband stashed on (or in) our bodies. (Jarrod did not disclose that he had in fact smuggled a flashlight into the facility in a pair of reading glasses, for the purposes of reading after lights out.)

After the strip search, we received “greens,” ill-fitting forest green jumpsuits stamped “DOC” in six-inch white letters across the back, and so-called Air Patakis, flimsy, flat-bottomed Velcro shoes with no arch support. Generally speaking, Patakis run large, and all the clothes run small. Nothing really fits.

We got dressed and were ordered to escort ourselves to the clinic down the hall. It was an introduction to the fairly lax transport practices at C-76, where inmates are sometimes allowed to simply roam the halls unescorted. A befuddled Jarrod was dispatched to the clinic with no escort. He knocked on the door repeatedly, until someone on the other side shouted, “Come back later!” Confused about how to proceed, he just sat down on a nearby bench. When the door finally opened, Jarrod was greeted by a Black female CO loudly berating a crying man in a cage: “He's crying like a little boy,” she taunted, “and he a grown-ass man!”

The C-76 clinic is a cramped office reminiscent of a food stamp processing center or drop-in center, worked by the same kind of civilian bureaucrat one would encounter in one of those spaces, and overseen by COs posted up near the door. We had our vitals taken, underwent a perfunctory discussion of mental health, and were asked about dietary restrictions. Almost as a joke, Jarrod remarked that he was a vegan, and to his surprise, was sent a few cubicles down to a thirty-something Jamaican dietician with a big beard and large golden necklaces, one of which was the scales of justice. In the background, a professional shoplifter debated with the nurses whether his trade was morally wrong. Hearing this, the dietician remarked to Jarrod, “Who makes those rules? Who says ‘Thou shalt not steal?'” He paused, before answering: “The rich! They say ‘Thou shalt not steal' so we don't steal their things, and ‘Thou shalt not kill' so we don't kill them! They don't follow those rules, only us!” He shook his head, and Jarrod followed in kind, before they both went on with the business of inmate intake at a facility where the poor are held captive at the behest of the rich. At least Jarrod was promised some vegan food.

David got his first glimpse of DOC's disorganization during his initial clinic visit. He was paired with one nurse who asked him a battery of questions about medical conditions, addictions, and so on, and then asked him to step into a bathroom and provide a urine sample. When he came out, he was paired with another nurse who asked him the exact same questions. A few days later, he was sent to the clinic again, only to repeat the entire process because his blood and urine samples had apparently been misplaced.

After processing in the clinic, we were returned to an intake pen. More waiting. Jarrod was, at last, issued his ID card and taken to the intake dormitory, where he received a flimsy and uneven rubber-coated mattress, two sheets, a green plastic cup, toothpaste, a toothbrush, a towel, and a small bar of soap. When David served his sentence a few years later, the DOC had switched from ID cards to ID bracelets, which he was cautioned to wear at all times. When he was finally moved from the holding pen to the intake dormitory, a CO unlocked a hallway closet as David and two other transferees waited beside him, fumbled inside for a moment, and then began throwing flaccid vinyl pillows, mattresses, sheets, and horse blankets onto the floor in front of them. One of the three had been to Rikers before; he immediately scooped up the least deflated-looking mattress and pillow. Though the other two were issued cups at this time, the CO could not find one for David. “Sorry, man,” he said as he locked the closet, “just ask the floor officer in the morning.” It ultimately took three days for David to get a cup.

This command over daily life becomes so powerful that many COs become accustomed to dictating the very nature of reality.

Musician and New York City counterculture leader Ed Sanders, who served city time at Hart Island in 1962 following a sit-in at the Atomic Energy Commission, recalls his own intake: “We were processed into the citadel. We were given some stiff black shoes, loose jeans, blue shirt, towels, and thick green overcoat. Never in my life had such a negative rush of immediate boredom stormed my soul.”

One's first time entering a massive caged dormitory filled with captive men can be quite overwhelming, and is a crucial moment for the new arrival. “When you walk into a house on Rikers Island, it's all eyes on you…. Everybody lookin' to see if they know you from somewhere … to see if you a rat, gang member,” explains one formerly incarcerated YouTuber. “I noticed the garbage in various corners of the huge room,” recalls Marcos Perez, who served city time in the early 2010s. “The steam from the bathroom carried the odor of numerous people relieving themselves. Further in, people sitting, standing, talking, and arguing…. Then the silence and attention turned toward me as I slowly walked in, looking for a bed of my own.” So too did we take in this intimidating setting as much as possible, without appearing doe-eyed, before making our way to the harsh bedframe that would serve as home base for navigating an unfamiliar and threatening terrain.

In the days after our arrival, we received the second half of the institutional intake, in which we were instructed by demonstration how the facility was to be run. We learned that rules and policies were selectively enforced, and often just made up, depending on the day and the CO in charge. Jarrod had a very difficult time getting a copy of the Inmate Handbook, which is supposed to be made available to every new arrival. While David was later able to grab one from a stack in Intake, during Jarrod's time, they were scarce in C-76, and men who showed up to the 11-Lower dormitory with the handbook saw it confiscated as “contraband” by COs who were sick of hearing that they violated inmates' rights. A common motto within the DOC describes the job as “care, custody, and control.” One CO during Jarrod's time, a Black woman who spent much of the day bellowing obscenities at any inmate looking in her general direction, spelled out exactly what this means on Rikers: “It's called ‘care, custody, and control': I don't care, you're in my custody, and I'm in control.”

The COs' rule by belligerent force begins immediately and constitutes the most visceral aspect of institutional intake. Those arriving at a new house are often berated by COs for their personal hygiene, humiliated in front of other inmates with a variety of schoolyard taunts, and warned in harsh tones to do what they are told, not cause any trouble, and basically “shut the fuck up,” as some COs were quick to command. Questions of any kind about how the house functions are generally treated by COs as a major inconvenience, or else eyed suspiciously. COs are commonly instructed that nearly every request from an incarcerated person, including asking for basic amenities like toilet paper, is likely the beginning of a complex process of seduction that will lead the CO to ruin. When David, newly arrived, asked a CO how to sign up for a clinic visit, she responded with disgust that he was “a real smart-ass” and simply walked away. On a more basic level, the freedom to not care about inmates' basic needs, except when the spirit moves them, is a coveted part of Rikers COs' daily work. Accordingly, they made it clear from the onset that regardless of what was said on paper, they did not have to lift a finger to do anything for an incarcerated person, unless they damn well wanted to. This applied to daily schedules, which were hopelessly opaque. The times for elective daily activities like sick call or law library were not announced in advance, and often conflicted, with no warning or recourse. Inmates, for example, had to decide if going to sick call, their daily chance to (maybe) see a doctor, was worth possibly missing their daily trip to the yard, if it was called while they were out. And if they missed sick call because they could not hear the announcement over the impossibly loud dormitory noise, it was their fault for not paying attention, and they might have another chance to get it right tomorrow. Everything was called abruptly, as inmates who had been waiting around for hours were suddenly summoned with excited shouts, belittled for taking too long, and threatened with being left behind. This false urgency, coupled with vast stretches of dead time, whether at the behest of a CO's whim, or the jail's lumbering bureaucracy, called to mind the old military adage: “Hurry up and wait.”

With no efficient system in place for addressing the dormitories, COs simply bellow commands on the spot, and become incensed when they are not immediately followed by inmates who often cannot even hear them. Meanwhile, the COs very publicly prioritize small talk among themselves, often loud and without concern for being overheard, over the needs of inmates, however pressing. “At first their carefree banter seemed to have nothing to do with me,” recalls Michael Walker, “but then I got it in my head that they were ignoring me on purpose — like they wanted me to feel unimportant.”

Though DOC policy calls for daily orientation sessions to be conducted by COs for all newly arrived inmates, neither of us ever saw or even heard of such a thing at Rikers, nor had anyone we met while incarcerated there. On the contrary, most of what we learned about the institution from COs we gleaned not from their explicit instruction but by watching them operate. As Gresham Sykes argues, “The incomprehensible order or rule is a basic feature of life in prison.” This was also observed over a century ago by New York City political prisoner Carlo de Fornaro, who served eight months of city time on Blackwell's Island in 1910. “As there are no written rules, and nobody informs us of all the unwritten rules on our entrance here … this apparent forgetfulness is really meant to give the warden and the keepers an unchallenged power of persecution over suspected and unruly convicts.” More recently, longtime federal prisoner Michael G. Santos recalls remarking to an uncooperative guard, “Living in the unknown is just part of being a prisoner. Isn't it?”

When pressed for explanations, COs most often default to a parental “because I said so.” They do this partly because it is simply easier for COs to bark commands than explain themselves, which enables them to tailor their work to whatever is easiest and most convenient for them, inmate needs be damned. It also derives from the COs' quasi-military structure, in which those who interact with inmates mostly fall at the bottom of a harsh chain of command, and receive similarly unqualified orders on a last-minute, need-to-know basis. In this sense, COs simply extend this hierarchy to their relations with inmates, rudeness and all. But their refusal to provide information is also more fundamental. As Sykes argues, “Providing explanations carries an implication that those who are ruled have a right to know — and this in turn suggests that if the explanations are not satisfactory, the rule or order will be changed.” Refusing to explain themselves is both a symptom and a source of COs' unchecked power.

This command over daily life becomes so powerful that many COs become accustomed to dictating the very nature of reality. When Jarrod took a urine test in the clinic, the CO told him to place the cup on top of the blue trash can, and pointed to a red trash can. Jarrod hesitated for a split second, looking at the can, and then at the CO. “Put it on the red trash can!” the CO emphasized, as if he had said that the first time. Flummoxed, Jarrod complied, and received a look as if to say, “Was that so difficult to understand?” Similarly, Jarrod was dispatched to the mail room, and having not received mail for several days, hastened to make it there within a matter of minutes, only to find nobody inside. Upon his return, he was told, “You must have taken too long to get there.”

This attitude in particular is the cornerstone of the longstanding practice among Rikers COs of covering up their own transgressions, including violence against incarcerated people, by getting their stories straight with their coworkers, and converting their lies into institutional truths through the alchemy of paperwork. A 2014 Department of Justice investigation into adolescent facilities at C-74 and C-76 found systematic embellishment of paperwork, sanctioned up and down the chain of command, to routinely cover up incarcerated people's injuries and make COs' wrongdoings, and even the formal processes in which COs must explain their uses of force, vanish through the invocation of bureaucratic word magic.

“Officers were always told not to start shit outside their jail,” recalls former Rikers CO Gary Heyward, “because when it comes down to writing reports and coming up with lies to cover your ass, you'd rather they come from officers from your jail that you have a bond with, that you trust.” Former CO C. René West recounts being instructed by a senior officer on how to fabricate disciplinary write-ups, or, in the institutional language, make them “more juicy.” “When he was finished making my report ‘more juicy,' it was a completely different scenario. A small curse like ‘fuck you bitch' turned into a threat to kill my mother, rape me, or to visit me once he was released.”

In his first week, David was told by an officer in the Bubble that he could not leave for his visit because there was “an alarm.” When he asked what that meant, she frowned and impatiently told him, “Ask your fellow inmates, sir.” About a month into his sentence, David tried to give a small load of laundry to the institutional laundry services. The CO scowled and turned away, saying, “Can't you just wash it yourself?” Incidents like this are emblematic of a CO mindset based around abdicating the responsibility they are hired to take on, especially the “care” portion of the department's motto, and becoming indignant when asked to fulfill it. Most new arrivals, therefore, are left to rely on other inmates.

Jarrod was struck by how often inmates stated the obvious fact that they were presently located in jail. “This is jail!” was a popular refrain in a number of situations. It could refer to the lingering surprise that one had transitioned from free life to being incarcerated: “This is jail!” uttered incredulously. Lil Wayne notes in an early entry to his Rikers diary, “I traded a coffee pack for a pack of noodles. Damn … I'm really in jail!” It could be an imperative, a reminder that the setting called for steely resolve: “This is jail,” meaning “toughen up.” It could be a simple, dismissive statement of fact, almost like a shrug: “This is jail,” so what do you expect? Above all, it was the affirmation that this was a social setting with particular rules different from those of the outside world. “This is jail,” and you had better behave accordingly. This sentiment figures prominently in social intake, the process by which inmates instruct the new arrival in the written — and largely unwritten — rules structuring daily life in the facility.

Former Rikers detainee Russell “Half ” Allen dramatizes his own experiences with social intake at C-74 in the novel Gladiator School. “Listen kid,” an old-timer named Mr. Thomas tells the young Half as they exit the DOC bus on Rikers, “I want you to stay focused and stay to yourself. You didn't come here to make friends. You do your time, and you get your ass home. That's the plan, you understand?”

For those who come from neighborhoods and other social settings with considerable overlap with Rikers, or have previous experience with incarceration, learning the ropes in a new facility is a matter of parsing out minor local differences, such as the governing rules of a particular building or dormitory. For this, there is a vibrant network of communication, publicizing local knowledge throughout the facility. As one incarcerated man tells rookie CO Rakin Mohammad in the novel Across the Bridge, written by former Rikers CO Steven Dominquez, “Word travels quick here, big dawg. Rikers isn't as big as you think it is, especially for a person like me who comes in and out of this bitch.”

For inmates like David and Jarrod, whose prior knowledge of jail life was largely restricted to popular culture and anecdotes from other non-traditional inmates, much of the social world is mysterious. Yet it is urgent to learn it as quickly as possible, at the risk of making a disastrous faux pas. A codefendant of Jarrod's who was locked up at C-76 before him described it as “an endless hermeneutic” in which almost every social interaction and daily activity comes with a set of structuring norms that are invisible, and initially bewildering, yet necessary to decipher and observe.

Jarrod's social-intake process began before he even boarded the bus. Waiting in line at the city courthouse on the day he was to begin his sentence, Jarrod sparked up a conversation with a young man who claimed to frequent the island, and who broke down his time strategy: “Don't look at the calendar, don't look at the clock.” Such pithy proverbs are plentiful throughout the system. Shortly thereafter Jarrod received another from an inmate with experience in both city and state facilities. He explained that the key to navigating the push and pull of macho posturing in the jail is presenting a stern front while actually practicing benevolence and kindness to those around you or, in his words, “being nice, without looking like a bitch doing it.”

Jarrod also benefited immensely from the insights of a codefendant who wrote a step-by-step guide explaining what Jarrod could expect. It began, “I think it's safe to say that it won't be nearly as bad as you're expecting it to be. If you just stay within yourself, stay thoughtful and humble, you'll be perfectly fine.” This kind of firsthand knowledge, which really only comes from word of mouth, proved invaluable in mitigating the fear that accompanies uncertainty in such a hostile setting. David was put in touch with a number of formerly incarcerated activists, including Jarrod, before his sentence began. Though all offered useful advice for serving time, David found that nothing can truly prepare a person for the first time behind bars.

The most important part of social intake begins in the dormitory. Among the first instructions new arrivals get from their fellow inmates is a rundown of the hygiene standards, often emphasizing the prohibition of naked showering and the necessity of covering oneself while using the toilet. These commands echo throughout the intake dormitory. Another early lesson revolves around use of the dormitory's telephones. While these are technically free for anyone to use any time they are turned on, lines of gang affiliation and other soft-power dynamics structuring dormitory life often dictate otherwise. Socks placed on phone receivers communicate the presence of these rules, and it is incumbent on the individual to figure out what they mean. The results of ignoring or disobeying them could be violence, or at least public humiliation signaling vulnerability.

Other house rules may govern the maximum state of undress permitted in the dorm, who can touch the TV and when, who can open the windows and when, who can sleep in which bed or “section,” where to walk in order to avoid disrupting what little privacy is available, and even how to use the Cambro drink dispenser for ice cubes or beverages. Inmates also share information about the personalities of individual COs, which rules are enforced and by whom, what kind of tacit agreements exist between them, such as the proper protocol for smoking without getting in trouble, and scheduling information like when the house goes to commissary. Often enough, all of this is readily communicated by one or more inmates who pull the new arrival aside to tell him the ropes. If the arrivant is lucky, this will be somebody known to him from another house or the street. If not, as the reader is likely aware from popular culture, overenthusiastic interest shown by a stranger could be the sign of a predator.

Accordingly, we were both warned to refuse any act of generosity shown by strangers upon our arrival. Leaving nothing to chance, we both insisted on offering objects for trade in exchange for the first items we wanted — writing utensils, relatively worthless commodities in the jail economy — lest we be ensnared in a web of extortion. David flat-out refused another inmate's offer to give him a couple of packs of ramen noodles until he could go to commissary. In all likelihood, with the benefit of hindsight, the people who offered these items were probably just being nice. It is much more common for sentenced men on Rikers to share food and hygiene products with each other, even with new arrivals, than might be assumed. This is not to say that extortion and other forms of predation do not exist but that most people David and Jarrod met were simply trying to make the best of a bad situation, and were willing to help others when they could.

Since city time is often served in multiple locations, beginning with the intake dormitory and then spread across any number of houses with different de facto rules, social intake never really ends. Even a seasoned inmate arrives at a new house in need of basic information. Upon transfer, Jarrod was pulled aside by a few inmates and politely yet firmly told, “This is a work house. We keep things quiet here, and don't want any trouble.” This sentiment was repeated, almost verbatim, by the dormitory's COs. This was no coincidence; Jarrod soon observed how a compact had been reached, under which COs overlooked minor infractions (smoking, for instance, was constant and almost always ignored) in exchange for a quiet and orderly facility. In this house, open belligerence toward staff and other inmates, which might be a path to shotcaller status in a more chaotic dormitory, was frowned upon. People looking to make good names for themselves by causing a conflict were more likely to turn the whole dormitory against them than win its respect.

The first bed David picked was empty, but as soon as he put his belongings down on it, one of the men next to it let him know that he might want to move: it was a “hot” bed, and had contraband stashed in it. David settled on a bed across the dorm next to a thirty-something Black man he did not know, and two Black men he had been with in the intake dorm the day before. Jarrod arrived in the intake dorm and soon realized he had an entire section to himself, even as the rest of the dorm was getting crowded. He later learned that shortly before his arrival, two inmates serving short “skid bid” sentences had quarreled in this section. One shoved the other, who fell, hit his head on the bed next to Jarrod's, and died. Before the week was out, however, the bed in question was the scene of a lively game involving bouncing a marble-like Fireball hard candy off the metal, trying to sink it into one of the frame's ventilation holes. Soon it was taken by a new arrival, and the stigma forgotten.

The designated intake dorm, 1-Upper, was a chaotic place because its population was always transient, meaning that no enduring power structure could ever be built. Both inmates and COs told David that incarcerated men generally spent as little as two days but no longer than two weeks in 1-Upper. David arrived there near midnight, and just picked a random bed in the near-empty dorm. There was nobody running the dorm, and nobody had much of anything, having just arrived from the street or another facility. There were no books, nothing to write with or on, and no commissary food or hygiene products, since no one had been able to go to commissary yet. The other inmates there quickly learned that David was a first-timer, and helped him learn the ropes. One guy demonstrated how to tie his sheet around his mattress properly so it would stay put. Another showed him how the phones worked and offered him a phone call.

Once David arrived in his first long-term dorm, and settled in next to his acquaintances from the intake dorm, some inmates immediately offered him commissary food while others explained how the phones and the bathroom worked. One man in his section, a Puerto Rican in his fifties, offered to hook him up with “the best jail job there is” (in his opinion, the bakery). “Write your number down here, and I'll talk to my boss,” he said. David, not yet in a jail mindset, confusedly asked the man if he meant his phone number. The man sucked his teeth and shot him an incredulous look. “No, man — your book and case number!”

The same man also enthused over how David had chosen a good bed, because it had a view of the moon at night. After nightfall, he squinted and pointed a finger up at a white disk above the neighboring wing of the building. “See?” he told David. “The full moon!”

It was a searchlight.

The Republican budget bill blocking state regulations also allocates hundreds of millions in federal funds toward AI.

The Republican budget bill blocking state regulations also allocates hundreds of millions in federal funds toward AI.

Pointing out right-wing hypocrisy does little to alleviate its toll. Still, one provision tucked into Republicans' sweeping tax and spending bill is particularly glaring in its ideological inconsistency: a 10-year ban on state AI regulation.

Yes, that means that the party most wont to cry federal overreach is now seeking to directly intervene in state policymaking. Of course, Republicans have always only championed states' rights when it's politically expedient to do so. And while GOP backers have said the “One Big Beautiful Bill” would prevent a confusing patchwork of AI laws from taking shape across the country, it still includes some exemptions for state laws that promote AI development. Go figure.

The 1,116-page legislative package — a key conduit for the GOP to enact President Donald Trump's budget goals — narrowly passed the House with a one-vote margin on May 22. It's now with the Senate, where some Republican legislators have pledged to rewrite portions of the contentious megabill. As traditional fiscal conservatives wrangle with Trump's MAGA allies, it will likely be weeks before we see another vote, though lawmakers hope to finalize the bill by the end of July to avoid a debt default. 

Much to the tech industry's delight, the GOP's budget bill proposes allocating millions of dollars to the Pentagon for AI-powered weapons, as well as $25 million on contracts for AI systems to detect “Medicare fraud.” Republicans also want to allocate $500 million over 10 years to update government systems with AI. In that timespan, new state-level AI regulations would be banned, and the enforcement of dozens of preexisting state regulations would be prohibited as well. These existing rules take aim at widespread concerns like deepfake misinformation, algorithmic rent-setting tools and AI-generated explicit content, particularly of children. If enacted, the proposed AI provision could lead to “unfettered abuse,” a coalition of more than 140 organizations warned in a letter to Congress earlier this month. Additionally, generative AI is associated with decreased cognitive skills, and it's known to guzzle massive amounts of water, consume a great deal of energy and emit climate-warming greenhouse gases. As the technology rapidly becomes more and more advanced and pervasive, we should not be rolling back the few guardrails that currently exist.

Republicans have claimed that the various state laws should be usurped by a cohesive national policy. While this is a worthwhile goal, no such federal framework exists, and there's little hope that one will arrive anytime soon. On his first day in office, Trump overturned Joe Biden's executive order on AI ethics and safety, which set goals for a “whole-of-government” approach to regulating generative AI and addressing its social risks. Issued in October 2023, Biden's EO outlined eight guiding principles and priorities for AI development, including calling for consumer protections and pushing to safeguard privacy and civil liberties as AI advances. But even Biden's executive order, as a set of unbinding guidelines, failed to manifest as concrete policy decisions.

Tech watchdogs and policy experts note that, despite decades of advocacy, there is still no national data privacy law. Others point to social media, which evolved and scaled with little government oversight and now proves difficult for lawmakers to rein in. “The arguments in favor of this provision only work if you believe that the federal government will soon pass broad guardrails to protect the public, or that AI will be a completely benign technology developed by companies that need no regulatory constraints,” Brad Carson, president of the AI policy nonprofit Americans for Responsible Innovation, told Government Technology. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of 40 state attorneys general pushed back against the proposed AI rule, writing in a letter, “Imposing a broad moratorium on all state action, while Congress fails to act in this area, is irresponsible and deprives consumers of reasonable protections.”

In December, the bipartisan House Task Force on Artificial Intelligence released a lengthy report outlining suggestions for promoting AI innovation while protecting against the technology's harms. During a House budget hearing, the chairman of the task force, Rep. Jay Obernolte (R-California), expressed frustrations that Congress had not moved forward with codifying the report's recommendations, and he cited congressional inaction as his reason for supporting the Big Beautiful Bill's AI provision. Obernolte argues that a state moratorium is needed to eliminate the regulatory burden on small tech startups trying to navigate a maze of state laws, while giving Congress time to hammer out a national framework. Experts, however, say the current state laws are hardly as cumbersome as Republicans have made them out to be and largely focus on things like transparency. For instance, California, Illinois and Maryland have enacted legislation requiring businesses to disclose when and how AI systems are being used, and in some cases might require employers to obtain an employee's consent before using AI to collect their data.

And while Republicans claim that the AI rule is intended to protect small and midsize AI businesses, it's been Big Tech that's leading the deregulatory push. During a May 8 Senate hearing, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called state laws “burdensome” and Microsoft President Brad Smith advocated for limited regulation. (Altman, notably, embraced calls for extensive AI regulation back in 2023, telling Congress that the technology could “cause significant harm to the world.”) In Tech Policy Press article debunking state AI law myths, Kara Williams, a law fellow at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, and Ben Winters, director of AI and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America, point out that big tech companies have repeatedly failed to honor their own promises to self-regulate. Williams and Winters argue that regulation can help innovation, not hinder it, and note that state transparency requirements typically are limited to basic information about when AI is used on a consumer. “If simple disclosures of this nature would be disastrous to any company,” they write, “it perhaps points to a deficiency in the product, not the regulation requiring the disclosures.”

It's unclear whether the proposed AI rule will make it across the finish line. With the Big Beautiful Bill now in the Senate for consideration, GOP critics have largely focused on fiscal issues like shaving off spending, making certain tax cuts permanent, preventing the debt ceiling from rising, and, in some cases, opposing unpopular cuts to Medicaid and food stamp benefits. Thus far, only two Republican senators, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri), have publicly pushed back against the AI provision. However, it will likely face a steep uphill battle, since a guideline known as the Byrd Rule prevents “extraneous matters” from being included in the budget reconciliation bill.

Ultimately, it'll be up to the Senate parliamentarian to determine whether a 10-year ban on state AI laws qualifies as a budget-related item or if it must be excised. If the AI regulatory moratorium does end up on the chopping block, some Republicans say that they'll fight to push it through as a separate piece of legislation. And even before we see the final reconciliation bill, we know it'll include these things: tax cuts for the rich, more money to the military and police, and fewer benefits for everyone else.

Follow:


            President Donald Trump's swipes at Apple aren't just bruising the company's bottom line — they may also be taking a bite out of your 401(k).
    


            The president's chaotic trade war continues to threaten Apple's business model, which relies extensively on international supply chains. Apple's stock has tumbled 20% this year after hitting a record high in December. The company's stock dropped 3% in one day earlier this month after Trump demanded Apple move all of its production to the United States.
    


            As the tech giant grapples with the president's tariff threats, Americans' retirement savings have taken a hit, too.
    


            Apple, the third-largest US company by market value, is a core component of many retirement plans, such as 401(k)s. Retirement savings are often invested in funds that track the S&P 500, and (AAPL) accounts for 6% of the S&P 500's value, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
    


            The S&P 500 is weighted by market value. That means the larger a company is, the more it influences the index.
    


            The tech giant has shed nearly $1 trillion in market value this year. Its market value topped a record high $3.9 trillion in December, according to FactSet, but was down to just above $3 trillion as of Friday.
    


            The company's stock also sank 9.25% and posted its worst day in five years after Trump's initial announcement of massive “reciprocal” tariffs in early April.

            Apple isn't the only stock souring. Shares of other large companies like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA) have tumbled 6%, 9% and 14% this year respectively, which could also cause the values of 401(k)s to stall.
    


            The two largest companies in the United States by market value, Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA), have gained 9% and 0.6% respectively this year. The S&P 500 is up just 0.5% as other stocks have lagged.
    


            “You just can't continue to keep an economy and companies operating in a cloud of extraordinarily high uncertainty forever without some economic consequences eventually,” said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments.
    


            Americans collectively held $44.1 trillion in retirement assets at the end of 2024, according to data from the Investment Company Institute. Of those funds, about $8.9 trillion were held in 401(k)s. Retirement savings are long-term investments, and short-term volatility is often overcome by long-term gains.
    


            As evidenced by the S&P 500's rally in recent weeks, it's ill-advised to try and sell your portfolio in times of panic because you can miss out on rebounds in the market. Historically, short-term downturns are overcome by gains. Market downturns can be unnerving, but the stock market generally rewards investors who are patient.
    


            Trump's trade war has dealt a blow to some of America's most widely held stocks, and investors — whether Wall Street titans or regular folks with a 401(k) — have been left to stomach the volatility.
    


            Blue-chip stocks have fluctuated, and the reliable strategy of buying and holding has been put through the wringer as stocks have bounced around without much clarity.
    


            It's important to know what your retirement savings are invested in to ensure your portfolio is well diversified, said Tim Steffen, director of advanced planning at Baird Private Wealth Management.
    


            While funds that track indexes like the S&P 500 are relatively well diversified, different 401(k) plans can offer funds with different exposures to areas of the market. It's helpful to know how much you have invested in big names like Apple to better gauge how policies affect your portfolio during periods of volatility.
    


            “You may think you've got a very diversified account because you have four different mutual funds, but if all four of those funds are tracking the same type of stocks, you probably don't have a very diversified portfolio,” Steffen said.

            Market downturns are opportunities to check your exposure and consider diversifying. Investing in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track bonds or international stocks can help mitigate risk and offset sharp declines.
    


            “That's really the point behind mutual funds or ETFs,” Steffen said. “It's an efficient way to get a diversified portfolio.”
    


            Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments, said Apple has certainly been “having a tough year,” but he doesn't think the company is in “any danger of being a long-term underperformer.”
    


            “I don't think people should be looking at the value of their 401(k) on a daily basis,” Martin said, noting that it is long-term money that will grow over years and decades.
    


            Apple faces two major “unknowns” this year, according to Angelo Zino, a senior vice president and technology analyst at CFRA Research.
    


            “First and foremost, it's the tariff talk,” Zino said.
    


            The tech giant is at the top of the list of companies exposed to uncertainties around tariffs, he said. “We need to wait to see what that outcome is going to look like, and that's creating uncertainty in the share price right now.”
    


            Then there are the ongoing antitrust concerns against fellow tech giant Alphabet (GOOGL), Google's parent company. A federal judge in August ruled Google had an illegal monopoly on search, which could signal trouble ahead for Apple because the case centered in part on exclusive deals between Google and Apple, according to Zino.
    


            Despite the fluctuations, Apple is still seen as a strong and resilient investment, said Zino and Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The strategists at CFRA, who have a “buy” on the stock, said its “premium valuation” is justified by factors including strong capital returns and its stable free cash flow.
    


            “The Street has continuously tried to kill off Apple at times,” Zino added. “There's always been something out there, and Apple has always been able to find a way to evolve.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","The ‘r-word' is back. How a slur became renormalized","https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/31/us/r-word-slur-comeback-cec","Sat, 31 May 2025 12:30:00 GMT","


EDITOR'S NOTE:  This article features language that may be hurtful to readers.



            On an April episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience,” the host used a slur within the first 45 seconds of the show.
    


            “The word ‘retarded' is back, and it's one of the great culture victories,” Rogan said with a laugh in the April 10 episode of his über-popular podcast. “Probably spurred on by podcasts.”
    


            A few months earlier, on January 6, Elon Musk used the word in response to a Finnish researcher who called Musk the “largest spreader of disinformation in human history.”
    


            Use of the slur more than doubled on X, the platform Musk owns, in the two days after he made that January post, researchers from Montclair State University found. More than 312,000 subsequent posts made on X in that span contained the r-word, wrote co-author Bond Benton, a professor of communication at the New Jersey university.
    


            The buck didn't stop there, Benton said. Throughout 2025, influential public figures like Rogan, Musk and Kanye West have used the r-word on platforms where millions can see and hear them. (West most recently used the term in March to refer to Jay-Z and Beyoncé's twins, though those X posts are now deleted.)
    


            Since Musk's January post, the online prevalence of the r-word is “absolutely getting worse,” Benton told CNN.
    


            Rogan, Musk and West are likely using the word to get a rise out of people and draw more eyes to their content, Benton said. But by using a term that has historically been used to disparage and diminish people with disabilities, they're renormalizing the slur among followers and fans who interact with their posts, he said.
    


            Musk, Rogan and West haven't responded to CNN's requests for comment.
    


            The resurgence of the r-word is symptomatic of a graver problem — the “apparent death of empathy,” said Adrienne Massanari, an associate professor at American University who has studied how the far-right uses tech to grow its influence.
    


            “What you're seeing now, people's masks are off,” Massanari said. “This is not just misunderstanding but the mischaracterization and demonization of communities. The use of that kind of language is signaling a shift, a desire to sort of push the envelope.”
    


            Push the envelope too far, she said, and the harm spills out into all marginalized communities. The r-word's surging popularity is just the latest effort in a movement to normalize hate, she said.
    


            The r-word has never really gone away, Massanari said — many people still use the word in private, and controversial far-right influencers and some members of the former “dirtbag left” podcast scene alike have used it for years to rile up followers and appeal to edgy comedic styles.
    


            But most people “were comfortable with the word retreating from normal discourse,” after years of campaigns designed to end use of the slur, Benton said.
    


            “There was a reason these words are no longer being used,” Massanari said. “They weren't productive. They weren't helping. They are actively harming communities.”
    


            The r-word, initially, was meant to replace words that had become pejoratives. Introduced in 1895, “mental retardation” became the preferred term among psychologists, supplanting the diagnostic labels “imbecile,” “moron” and “feebleminded,” said Lieke van Heumen, a clinical associate professor in disability and human development at the University of Illinois, Chicago.
    


            The r-word was intended to be a “neutral” term, van Heumen said. But people with disabilities then were still largely disregarded and treated as lesser members of society, regularly institutionalized in dangerous environments and even forcibly sterilized without their consent. Under those conditions, the r-word eventually warped into a slur and an insult, she said.
    


            “When disability is framed as a lack, limitation or loss, it reinforces the idea that people with disabilities are inherently incapable,” van Heumen told CNN. “This framing is used to justify their exclusion from everyday life, as if they are missing what it takes to participate. Such language is not harmless — it influences public attitudes, informs policy decisions and ultimately affects how people with disabilities are treated.”
    


            The chorus to retire the r-word grew louder in the 1970s, van Heumen said, as people with disabilities advocated for their right to participate fully in society and end the use of ableist language. Nearly 40 years later, the “Spread the Word to End the Word” campaign encouraged young people in particular to quit using the slur to insult their peers.
    


            The federal government signaled its support to end the use of the r-word with 2010's “Rosa's Law,” named for a young girl with Down syndrome, which updated all federal laws to use “intellectual disability” in place of “mental retardation.” The legislation stated that the term and its “derivatives,” including the r-word, were “used to demean and insult both persons with and without disabilities.”
    


            Sophie Stern, a 22-year-old choreographer and actress from Arizona, has Down syndrome and is a member of the Arizona Developmental Disabilities Planning Council. For years, she's confronted classmates who've said the r-word in front of her, even petitioning to have the word removed from a script.
    


            But she's hearing the word more often now than she did in school, she told CNN. And it doesn't make her any less upset to hear it, even if it's not directed at her.
    


            “It still hurts my feelings,” she said.
    


            Celebrities used to apologize when they were “caught” using the r-word. Khloe and Kim Kardashian both issued statements when they used the slur in clips shared on Instagram in 2018. LeBron James apologized at least twice for letting the r-word slip in postgame interviews in 2011 and 2014. Author John Green said in 2015 that he shouldn't have used the word in his popular YA novel “Paper Towns,” in which it appears in a quote from a teenage character.
    


            Today, whether it's “Silicon Valley tech bros” or far-right ​figures, people who use the r-word online appear to share a motivation — “the appeal of transgression,” said Julie Ingersoll, a professor of religious studies at the University of North Florida. Many people who use the r-word know it will anger people who disagree with them, Ingersoll said — it's a way of “owning the libs.”
    


            “I think that they are flaunting their ability to offend and confront,” she said. “Why do you need that word? If it bothers other people, why wouldn't you just pick a different word?”
    


            Content designed to provoke outrage is often more likely to court engagement — from both supporters and those who disagree, Benton said. Engagement guarantees visibility, and if the r-word is more visible online, it'll eventually become less jarring for users to encounter, he said.
    


            “Clicks are the currency in the commerce of social media,” Benton said. “And if I put up content where the r-word is prominently used, I can just guarantee there's going to be a few thousand replies.”
    


            Platforms can end up “rewarding” controversial content that draws sustained attention, said Brandon Harris, an assistant professor at the University of Alabama who studies content creators, especially those in the “manosphere.”
    


            “Being controversial is more profitable than being kind to people,” Harris told CNN.
    


            Inconsistent guidelines and enforcement on what constitutes hate speech also makes it easier to get away with using hurtful terms, Harris said.
    


            X and Spotify didn't respond to CNN's requests for comment on their hate speech guidelines, but neither platform allows attacking other users based on disability, among other characteristics. Content that violates these rules is sometimes removed, demonetized or made less visible, both companies have said. X does allow users to post “potentially inflammatory content” and encourages users to block or unfollow other users whose content offends them.
    


            Spokespeople for Meta and YouTube said their platforms do not allow the r-word to be used to mock a person's disability, but the word is not banned outright on either platform.
    


            The agitators using such language don't necessarily need to believe the things they say, Harris said — intent doesn't matter when the outcome normalizes the casual use of a hurtful term.
    


            A spike in online use of the r-word would be harmful on its own. But even more concerning is what the slur's return represents, Massanari said.
    


            “These are never just about the words,” she said. “The words are standing in place for a whole symbol.”
    


            What's happening now, where notable people are using the r-word in posts on X or on podcasts, is a “classic testing of the waters,” Massanari said, when influential people who get paid to agitate see how far they can push the line.
    


            “These communities come out to denigrate, to make fun of, to demonize the most marginalized,” she said.
    


            The r-word will almost certainly not be the last slur to reemerge on popular platforms, from popular users, Benton said. And when the line is continually pushed, it can take people to “the worst spaces imaginable,” he said.
    


            “The term itself — the casual use of it — is a problem,” he said. “The normalization of it will allow even more problematic terms to be normalized.”
    


            Other hurtful words are already being used to harm other marginalized people, Harris pointed out. Republican Rep. Nancy Mace earlier this year repeatedly used an anti-transgender slur in a House Oversight Committee hearing. CNN reached out to Mace about her use of the word. In response, her communications director said, “While you tiptoe” around hurting feelings, the congresswoman “is standing up for women and girls.”
    


            “We're now using language that promotes cruelty, and not just cruelty but casual cruelty — where you just offhandedly don't think about it and dismiss someone's humanity,” Harris said of using slurs like those lobbed at trans people and people with disabilities.
    


            Seeing how the r-word proliferates offline is the “next threshold” to cross, Benton said. Some people likely never stopped privately using the r-word, he said, but if people who aren't protected by wealth, fame or political affiliations use the word at their workplace or in social settings, they could face punishing consequences.
    


            Many people are actively pushing back against the r-word when they encounter it. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who has a son with Down syndrome, earlier this year called out Kanye West, “‘Christian conservatives'” and “popular newbie-conservative women” for “thinking it's hip to ramp up use of the ‘R' word.”
    


            “Please unfollow me & know that my disrespect for you is insurmountable,” she wrote on X in March.
    


            “The Brady Bunch” star Maureen McCormick, who's also a Special Olympics ambassador, said that Joe Rogan celebrating the resurgence of the r-word “ignores the terrible hurt” the slur causes people with disabilities.
    


            “This is not a victory,” she wrote on X, prompting more than 8,000 replies from supporters and detractors alike. “It is a regression.”
    


            Engaging with users who post the r-word to court outrage and online engagement can cause well-meaning people to fall into a trap of rage bait, Benton, Harris and Massanari cautioned. But there must still be resistance against reintegrating the r-word into regular speech, they said — a conversation most effective when it's had offline, person to person.
    


            “We have to continue to have courage, to have these conversations and these moments of resistance to say, ‘We don't appreciate what you're doing, we don't share your values,'” Harris said.
    


            Sophie Stern, the dance teacher from Arizona, has a word of guidance for anyone who wants to pick up the r-word: “Don't.”

Follow:


            One of the reasons politicians don't often engage in massive overhauls of the American economy is that it's very difficult to defend a massive overhaul of the American economy. However good any given plan is, it often produces losers and – even in the best of cases – some short-term pain.
    


            And repeatedly now as President Donald Trump has launched multiple massive overhauls, prominent Republicans have learned that the hard way.
    


Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa is the most recent.
    


            Appearing at a town hall on Friday, Ernst was pressed on cuts to Medicaid – the health care program for low-income Americans – in House Republicans' budget plan. One audience member shouted that “people will die.”
    


            The usual politician thing would have been to take issue with that premise – or to, as other Republicans have strained to do, cast the Medicaid cuts as merely cutting waste and abuse. (That's not the full story, of course; the Congressional Budget Office recently projected that House Republicans' changes to Medicaid, including work requirements for some recipients, would leave 7.6 million Americans uninsured by 2034.)
    


            But Ernst decided to go in a different direction.
    


            “Well, we all are going to die,” said Ernst, who's facing reelection in 2026.
    


            When hostile portions of the crowd balked at the response, she said: “For heaven's sakes, folks.”
    


            The senator and her office argued Friday that Republicans are in fact trying to “strengthen” Medicaid. A spokesman said: “There's only two certainties in life: death and taxes, and she's working to ease the burden of both by fighting to keep more of Iowans' hard-earned tax dollars in their own pockets and ensuring their benefits are protected from waste, fraud, and abuse.”
    


            Ernst in her remarks went on to accuse her critics of not wanting to “listen to me when I say that we are going to focus on those that are most vulnerable. Those that meet the eligibility requirements for Medicaid, we will protect … them.”
    


            As a contrast, she cited an oft-invoked GOP claim that 1.4 million undocumented immigrants are receiving Medicaid benefits. But that's not actually what the CBO estimate says – nor does it account for the other millions of people the CBO says would lose insurance.
    


            In other words, however bad Ernst's answer was, it might just be that there's not a good answer to be given. Republicans needed to cut spending to pay for Trump's tax cuts, and it's hard to cut enough unless you cut entitlements. It's a political minefield that even some Trump allies like Steve Bannon have warned their party about.
    


            And indeed, Democrats quickly leapt to highlight Ernst as the epitome of an uncaring, Medicaid-busting Republican.
    


            But Ernst is not the first to wander into this kind of territory. Repeatedly in recent weeks, prominent Republicans who have been asked to account for the pains caused by Trump's bold plans have stumbled into similar territory.
    


            Trump himself has repeatedly talked about how the price increases created by his tariffs might mean people have to buy fewer dolls for little girls.
    


            “You know, someone said, ‘Oh, the shelves, they're going to be open,'” Trump said. “Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.”
    


            Trump said on the campaign trail that foreign countries would pay the extra cost of the tariffs, not consumers.
    


            Conservative Daily Wire founder Ben Shapiro called Trump's comments “a tremendous commercial for Democrats” and urged Trump to avoid language that minimized the impacts of inflation.
    


            Back in March, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick addressed the administration's chaotic changes to the Social Security system by claiming that only “fraudsters” would complain about missing a Social Security check. He pointed to his own mother-in-law. (The administration has pursued a series of sometimes halting changes to the Social Security system, including limiting claims to in-person rather than over the phone – something it later walked back – and cutting staff.)
    


            “Let's say Social Security didn't send out their checks this month. My mother-in-law, who's 94 – she wouldn't call and complain,” Lutnick said. He added: “She just wouldn't. She'd think something got messed up, and she'll get it next month. A fraudster always makes the loudest noise – screaming, yelling and complaining.”
    


            It's logical to assume that Lutnick's mother-in-law wouldn't complain, given her son-in-law is a billionaire. But according to the Social Security Administration, more than 1 in 10 seniors rely on the program for at least 90% of their income.
    


            Are any of these game-changing gaffes? Not necessarily. But they are certainly fodder for Democrats to argue that Trump is pursuing a rather haphazard and callous overhaul of the American economy. It's the kind of thing Bannon warns about in cautioning Republicans against Medicaid cuts. There just aren't many good ways to defend millions of poor people being projected to lose their health insurance.
    


            And if the early evidence is any indication, it's going to result in plenty of awkward defenses in the future.

PARIS (AP) — When Jannik Sinner's opponent in the French Open's third round finally won a single game Saturday, the Court Suzanne-Lenglen crowd responded with a standing ovation. Sinner was simply too good on this day, extending his Grand Slam winning streak to 17 matches and looking very much like the No. 1-ranked man.

Sinner dominated Jiri Lehecka 6-0, 6-1, 6-2 in just 1 hour, 34 minutes, the quickest men's match at Roland-Garros this year and, measured by games lost, the most lopsided victory at a major tournament of Sinner's career.

“We try to improve,” Sinner said. “Today, I don't think there are many things I can improve.”

Can say that again.

Check out some of the numbers: Sinner delivered 31 winners and made only nine unforced errors. He accumulated 18 break points, converting seven, and faced just one, which he saved.

The first 11 games went Sinner's way. When Sinner missed a return wide, making the score 6-0, 5-1 after 55 minutes of action, Lehecka raised his arm and pumped his fist in a bit of sarcastic celebration. The fans went wild, rising out of their seats and clapping and shouting, eliciting a smile from Lehecka.

Make no mistake, though. Lehecka is no also-ran. The 23-year-old from the Czech Republic is ranked 34th and has been a Grand Slam quarterfinalist.

But he was completely overmatched by Sinner, who has won the past two major championships — at the U.S. Open in September and the Australian Open in January — and is now the owner of an unbeaten run at the sport's most important tournaments that's been surpassed this century only by a trio of guys by the names of Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

Sinner's bid for a first French Open title, and fourth Slam trophy overall, will continue Monday, when he'll face No. 17 Andrey Rublev for a quarterfinal berth. Rublev advanced when his opponent, No. 14 Arthur Fils, withdrew from the tournament because a stress fracture in his lower back.

Jessica Pegula, the No. 3-seeded American who was the runner-up at the U.S. Open, came back to eliminate 2019 French Open finalist and 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 and reach the fourth round. Another American, 70th-ranked Hailey Baptiste, made it into Week 2 at a major for the first time by beating Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 7-6 (4), 6-1 and will play Madison Keys or Sofia Kenin next. No. 6 Mirra Andreeva, an 18-year-old Russian who reached the semifinals a year ago, advanced to a fourth-round showdown against No. 17 Daria Kasatkina. American qualifier Ethan Quinn, the 2023 NCAA champion for the University of Georgia, played his second consecutive five-setter and was beaten by Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands 4-6, 6-1, 6-7 (2), 6-1, 6-4. Griekspoor came into the day 0-4 in third-round matches at majors. Griekspoor next meets 2024 runner-up Alexander Zverev, while No. 5 Jack Draper takes on Alexander Bublik. Draper defeated 18-year-old Brazilian João Fonseca 6-2, 6-4, 6-2.

No. 1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka and the two defending champions, Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz, are all scheduled to appear in the fourth round Sunday. There are three American men in Week 2 in Paris for the first time since 1995, and all are in action: No. 12 Tommy Paul, No. 13 Ben Shelton and No. 15 Frances Tiafoe. Shelton faces Alcaraz, Paul goes up against No. 25 Alexei Popyrin and Tiafoe meets Daniel Altmaier.

VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, a confidential report by the U.N. nuclear watchdog said Saturday. In a separate report, the agency called on Tehran to urgently change course and comply with its years-long probe.

The report comes at a sensitive time, as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to reach a deal with Tehran to limit its nuclear program. The two sides have held several rounds of talks, so far without agreement. 

The report by the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency — which was seen by The Associated Press — says that as of May 17, Iran has amassed 408.6 kilograms (900.8 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%. 

That's an increase of 133.8 kilograms (294.9 pounds) — or almost 50% — since the IAEA's last report in February. The 60% enriched material is a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. A report in February put this stockpile level at 274.8 kilograms (605.8 pounds).

There was no immediate comment from Tehran on the new IAEA report.




The IAEA report raised a stern warning, saying that Iran is now “the only non-nuclear-weapon state to produce such material” — something the agency said was of “serious concern.” 

Approximately 42 kilograms of 60% enriched uranium is theoretically enough to produce one atomic bomb, if enriched further to 90%, according to the watchdog.

The IAEA report, a quarterly, also estimated that as of May 17, Iran's overall stockpile of enriched uranium — which includes uranium enriched to lower levels — stood at 9,247.6 kilograms (20,387.4 pounds). That's an increase of 953.2 kilograms (2,101.4 pounds) since February's report. 

Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so.

Iranian officials have increasingly suggested that Tehran could pursue an atomic bomb. 

U.S. intelligence agencies assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program, but has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.”

Israel said Saturday's report was a clear warning sign that “Iran is totally determined to complete its nuclear weapons program,” according to a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office.

It said IAEA's report “strongly reinforces what Israel has been saying for years — the purpose of Iran's nuclear program is not peaceful.”

It also added that Iran's level of enrichment “has no civilian justification whatsoever” and appealed on the international community to “act now to stop Iran.”

It is rare for Netanyahu to make statements on Saturday, the Jewish day of rest, underlying the urgency with which he sees the matter.

Grossi said Saturday that he “reiterates his urgent call upon Iran to cooperate fully and effectively” with the IAEA's years long investigation into uranium traces discovered at several sites in Iran. 

The IAEA also circulated to member states on Saturday a second, 22-page confidential report, also seen by the AP, that Grossi was asked to produce following a resolution passed by the 35-member IAEA Board of Governors last November.

In this so-called “comprehensive report,” the IAEA said that Iran's cooperation with the agency has “been less than satisfactory” when it comes to uranium traces discovered by IAEA inspectors at several locations in Iran that Tehran has failed to declare as nuclear sites.

Western officials suspect that the uranium traces discovered by the IAEA could provide evidence that Iran had a secret military nuclear program until 2003. 

One of the sites became known publicly in 2018 after Netanyahu revealed it at the United Nations and called it a clandestine nuclear warehouse hidden at a rug-cleaning plant.

Iran denied this but in 2019 IAEA inspectors detected the presence of manmade uranium particles there.

After initially blocking IAEA access, inspectors were able to collect samples in 2020 from two other locations where they also detected the presence of manmade uranium particles.

The three locations became known as Turquzabad, Varamin, and Marivan.

A fourth undeclared location named as Lavisan-Shian is also part of the IAEA probe but IAEA inspectors never visited the site because it was razed and demolished by Iran after 2003.

In Saturday's comprehensive report, the IAEA says that the “lack of answers and clarifications provided by Iran” to questions the watchdog had regarding Lavisan-Shian, Varamin and Marivan “has led the agency to conclude that these three locations, and other possible related locations, were part of an undeclared structured nuclear program carried out by Iran until the early 2000s and that some activities used undeclared nuclear material.”

Saturday's comprehensive report could be a basis for possible further steps by European nations, leading to a potential escalation in tensions between Iran and the West. 

European countries could move to trigger snap-back sanctions against Iran that were lifted under the original 2015 nuclear deal ahead of October, when the deal formally expires.

On Thursday, senior Iranian officials dismissed speculation about an imminent nuclear deal with the United States, emphasizing that any agreement must fully lift sanctions and allow the country's nuclear program to continue. 

The comments came a day after Trump said he has told Netanyahu to hold off on striking Iran to give the U.S. administration more time to push for a new deal with Tehran.

Trump said on Friday that he still thinks a deal could be completed in the “not too distant future.”

“They don't want to be blown up. They would rather make a deal,” Trump said of Iran. He added, “That would be a great thing that we could have a deal without bombs being dropped all over the Middle East.”

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — In the southeastern Utah desert famous for red rock arches and canyon labyrinths, the long-dormant uranium mining industry is looking to revive under President Donald Trump.

Hundreds of abandoned uranium mines dot the West's arid landscapes, hazardous reminders of the promise and peril of nuclear power during the Cold War. Now, one mine that the Trump administration fast-tracked for regulatory approval could reopen for the first time since the 1980s.

Normally it would have taken months, if not years, for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to review plans to reopen a project like Anfield Energy's Velvet-Wood mine 35 miles (56 kilometers) south of Moab. But the bureau's regulators green-lit the project in just 11 days under a “national energy emergency” Trump has declared that allows expedited environmental reviews for energy projects. 

More permits and approvals will be needed, plus site work to get the mine operating again. And the price of uranium would have to rise enough to make domestic production financially sustainable. If that happens, it would mean revival — and jobs — to an industry that locally has been moribund since the Ronald Reagan era.

“President Trump has made it clear that our energy security is national security,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in announcing the fast-tracking policy in April. “These emergency procedures reflect our unwavering commitment to protecting both.”

More fast approvals appear likely. Trump's order also applies to oil, gas, coal, biofuel and hydropower projects — but not renewable energy — on federal lands.

Global uranium prices are double what they were at a low point seven years ago and, for the past year, the U.S. has banned uranium imports from Russia due to that country's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

More domestic mining would address a major imbalance. The U.S. imports about 98% of the uranium it uses to generate 30% of the world's nuclear energy. More than two-thirds of U.S. imports come from the world's top three uranium-mining countries: Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan.

Less government regulation won't spur more U.S. uranium mining by itself. The market matters. And while spot-market prices are up from several years ago, they're down about a third from their recent high in early 2024.

While some new uranium mining and processing projects have been announced, their number falls far short of a surge. That suggests prices need to rise — and stay there — for a true industry revival, said John Uhrie, a former uranium executive who now works in the cement industry.

“Until the price goes up dramatically, you're not going to be able to actually put these places into operation,” Uhrie said. “You need significant capital on the ground.”

Still, the industry is showing new life in the Southwest. 

Anfield Energy, a Canadian company, also looks to reopen the Shootaring Canyon uranium mill in southern Utah near Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. It closed in the early 1980s. A uranium mill turns raw ore into yellowcake, a powdery substance later processed elsewhere into nuclear fuel.

Anfield officials did not return messages seeking comment on plans to reopen the mill and the Velvet-Wood mine.

Energy Fuels, another Canadian company which ranks as the top U.S. uranium miner, opened the Pinyon Plain mine about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the Grand Canyon in late 2023.

And just off U.S. 191 in southeastern Utah is a hub of the industry, Uranium Fuels' White Mesa mill, the country's only uranium mill still in operation.

These days, Moab is a desert tourism hot spot bustling with outdoor enthusiasts. But the town of 5,200 has a deeper history with uranium. Nods to Moab's post-World War II mining heyday can been spotted around town — the Atomic Hair Salon isn't just named for its blowout hairstyles.

The biggest reminder is the Moab Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action project, a 480-acre (194-hectare) site just outside town. The decades-long, $1 billion U.S. Department of Energy effort to haul off toxic tailings that were leaching into the Colorado River upstream from the Grand Canyon and Lake Mead should wrap up within five more years.

That mill's polluting legacy makes some Moab residents wary of restarting uranium mining and processing, especially after the Trump administration cut short their ability to weigh in on the Velvet-Wood mine plans.

“This was a process I would have been involved in,” said Sarah Fields, director of the local group Uranium Watch. “They provided no opportunity for the public to say, ‘You need to look at this, you need to look at that.'”

Grand Canyon Trust, a group critical of the Pinyon Plain mine as a danger to groundwater, points out that the U.S. nuclear industry isn't at risk of losing access to uranium.

“This is all being done under the assumption there is some energy emergency and that is just not true,” said Amber Reimondo, the group's energy director. 

Hundreds of miles to the north, other nuclear energy projects point to the U.S. industry's future.

With Bill Gates' support, TerraPower is building a 345-megawatt sodium-cooled fast reactor outside Kemmerer in western Wyoming that could, in theory, meet demand for carbon-free power at lower costs and with less construction time than conventional reactor units.

Meanwhile, about 40% of uranium mined in the U.S. in 2024 came from four Wyoming “in-situ” mines that use wells to dissolve uranium in underground deposits and pump it to the surface without having to dig big holes or send miners underground. Similar mines in Texas and Nebraska and stockpiled ore processed at White Mesa accounted for the rest.

None — as yet — came from mines in Utah.

Powering electric cars and computing technology will require more electricity in the years ahead. Nuclear power offers a zero-carbon, round-the-clock option.

Meeting the demand for nuclear fuel domestically is another matter. With prices higher, almost 700,000 pounds of yellowcake was produced in the U.S. in 2024 — up more than a dozen-fold from the year before but still far short of the 32 million pounds imported into the U.S.

Even if mining increases, it's not clear that U.S. capacity to turn the ore into fuel would keep pace, said Uhrie, the former uranium mining executive. 

“Re-establishing a viable uranium industry from soup to nuts — meaning from mining through processing to yellow cake production, to conversion, to enrichment to produce nuclear fuel — remains a huge lift,” Uhrie said.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland is set to hold a presidential runoff election on Sunday between two candidates offering starkly different visions for the country's future.

The winner will succeed President Andrzej Duda, a conservative who is finishing his second and final term. The outcome will determine whether Poland embraces a nationalist populist trajectory or pivots more fully toward liberal, pro-European policies. An exit poll by Ipsos will be released when polls close on Sunday at 9 p.m. local time, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. Final results are expected Monday.

Whoever wins can be expected to either help or hinder the agenda of the centrist government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk thanks to the presidential power to veto laws.

The vote comes amid heightened regional tensions driven by Russia's war in neighboring Ukraine, security concerns across Europe and internal debates about the rule of law.

It follows a first round on May 18, in which Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski won more than 31% of the vote and Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian, earned nearly 30%. Eleven other candidates were eliminated.

Opinion polls show the two men running neck and neck. Other factors add to the unpredictability. Nawrocki did much better in the first round than surveys had predicted, indicating that his strength was underestimated. On the other hand, large numbers of Poles abroad have registered to vote in the second round, which could help Trzaskowski.

Nawrocki is a 42-year-old historian who was tapped as by the national conservative Law and Justice party despite a lack of political experience or party membership. But this is seen as acting in his favor, as the party, which governed for 2015-2023, seeks to refresh its image before a parliamentary election in 2027.

Nawrocki's supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic Polish values. They believe U.S. President Donald Trump's support for him will strengthen Poland's ties with the United States and make the country safer.

Trzaskowski, 53, is Warsaw's mayor and a close ally of Tusk. A deputy leader of Civic Platform, a pro-European Union party, he has been prominent in national politics for years. This is his second presidential bid after narrowly losing to Duda in 2020.

Supporters credit him with modernizing Warsaw through infrastructure, public transit expansion and cultural investments. He is widely seen as pragmatic and focused on strengthening ties with other European nations.

Nawrocki recently received a boost from Trump and other U.S. conservatives, who see the Polish election as part of a global battle between liberal and populist right-wing forces. 

His campaign has echoed themes popular on the American right, including skepticism toward EU bureaucracy and emphasis on Christian identity. His supporters feel that Trzaskowski, with his pro-EU views, would hand over control of key Polish issues to Paris and Berlin.

Nawrocki also has been endorsed by the Trump administration and conservative Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

Many European centrists are rooting for Trzaskowski, seeing in him someone who would defend democracy as it faces pressure from authoritarian forces across the globe. He has received the support of new centrist Romanian President Nicusor Dan — who recently defeated a far-right nationalist.

Nawrocki has faced a number of scandals over the past months, but it's not clear that they are hurting him. In fact, they might have the opposite effect. Many right-wing voters don't believe the allegations and accuse the media of using its power to hurt him, creating what appears to be a rallying effect around him.

Nawrocki himself has acknowledged that he took part in an organized brawl including football hooligans in 2009. A former boxer, he said he has taken part in various forms of “noble male battle” in his life.

Polish media have also reported on his connections to gangsters and the world of prostitution.

Tusk accused Law and Justice party leader Jarosław Kaczynski of tapping Nawrocki despite questions about his past. 

“You knew about everything, Jarosław. About the connections with the gangsters, about ‘fixing girls,'” Tusk wrote on X. “The entire responsibility for this catastrophe falls on you!”

1. Security and war in Ukraine: With Russia's war in Ukraine in its fourth year, Polish voters are acutely attuned to issues of regional security. Both candidates support continued backing for Ukraine, but to different degrees. Nawrocki believes that Ukraine should never join NATO, while Trzaskowski believes Ukraine should be allowed to join one day when the current war is over.

2. Rule of law and democracy: Trzaskowski has pledged to support the restoration of judicial independence and repair relations with the EU, which viewed changes by Law and Justice as anti-democratic. Tusk has tried to change some legislation, but has faced resistance from the the outgoing president, Duda. Nawrocki, while less outspoken than his party patrons, is seen as likely to preserve Law and Justice's changes that politicized the courts.

3. Women's rights: Abortion remains a divisive issue in Poland, especially after a near-total ban was imposed under Law and Justice. Trzaskowski supports loosening restrictions and has backed proposals to legalize abortion up to 12 weeks. Nawrocki opposes any liberalization and has campaigned as a defender of traditional conservative values.

Hundreds of foreign companies left Russia after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, including major U.S. firms like Coca-Cola, Nike, Starbucks, ExxonMobil and Ford Motor Co. 

But after more than three years of war, President Donald Trump has held out the prospect of restoring U.S.-Russia trade if there's ever a peace settlement. And Russian President Vladimir Putin has said foreign companies could come back under some circumstances. 

“Russia wants to do largescale TRADE with the United States when this catastrophic ‘bloodbath' is over, and I agree,” Trump said in a statement after a phone call with Putin. “There is a tremendous opportunity for Russia to create massive amounts of jobs and wealth. Its potential is UNLIMITED.”

The president then shifted his tone toward Putin after heavy drone and missile attacks on Kyiv, saying Putin “has gone absolutely crazy” and threatening new sanctions. That and recent comments from Putin warning Western companies against reclaiming their former stakes seemed to reflect reality more accurately — that it's not going to be a smooth process for businesses going back into Russia.

That's because Russia's business environment has massively changed since 2022. And not in ways that favor foreign companies. 

And with Putin escalating attacks and holding on to territory demands Ukraine likely isn't going to accept, a peace deal seems distant indeed. 

Here are factors that could deter U.S. companies from ever going back:




Russian law classifies Ukraine's allies as “unfriendly states” and imposes severe restrictions on businesses from more than 50 countries. Those include limits on withdrawing money and equipment as well as allowing the Russian government to take control of companies deemed important. Foreign owners' votes on boards of directors can be legally disregarded.

Companies that left were required to sell their businesses for 50% or less of their assessed worth, or simply wrote them off while Kremlin-friendly business groups snapped up their assets on the cheap. Under a 2023 presidential decree the Russian government took control of Finnish energy company Fortum, German power company Unipro, France's dairy company Danone and Danish brewer Carlsberg. 

Even if a peace deal removed the U.S. from the list of unfriendlies, and if the massive Western sanctions restricting business in Russia were dropped, the track record of losses would remain vivid. And there's little sign any of that is going to happen.

While the Russian government has talked in general about companies coming back, “there's no specific evidence of any one company saying that they are ready to come back,” said Chris Weafer, CEO of Macro-Advisory Ltd. consultancy. “It's all at the political narrative level.” 

Russia's actions and legal changes have left “long-lasting damage” to its business environment, says Elina Ribakova, non-resident senior fellow at the Bruegel research institute in Brussels. 

She said a return of U.S. businesses is “not very likely.” 

In a meeting at the Kremlin on May 26 to mark Russian Entrepreneurs Day, Putin said that Russia needed to throttle large tech firms such as Zoom and Microsoft, which had restricted their services in Russia after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, so that domestic tech companies could thrive instead.

“We need to strangle them,” Putin said. “After all, they are trying to strangle us: we need to reciprocate. We didn't kick anyone out; we didn't interfere with anyone. We provided the most favorable conditions possible for their work here, in our market, and they are trying to strangle us.”

He reassured a representative from Vkusno-i Tochka (Tasty-period) — the Russian-owned company that took over McDonald's restaurants in the country — that Moscow would aid them if the U.S. fast food giant tried to buy back its former stores. Asked for comment, McDonald's referred to their 2022 statement that “ownership of the business in Russia is no longer tenable.”

On top of Russia's difficult business environment, the economy is likely to stagnate due to lack of investment in sectors other than the military, economists say. 

“Russia has one of the lowest projected long-term growth rates and one of the highest levels of country risk in the world,” says Heli Simola, senior economist at the Bank of Finland in a blog post. “Only Belarus offers an equally lousy combination of growth and risk.” 

Most of the opportunity to make money is related to military production, and it's unlikely U.S. companies would work with the Russian military-industrial complex, said Ribakova. “It's not clear where exactly one could plug in and expect outsize returns that would compensate for this negative investment environment.”

Some companies, including Renault and Ford Motor Co., left with repurchase agreements letting them buy back their stakes years later if conditions change. But given Russia's unsteady legal environment, that's tough to count on.

The Russian purchasers may try to change the terms, look for more money, or ignore the agreements, said Weafer. “There's a lot of uncertainty as to how those buyback auctions will be enforced.”

Multinational oil companies were among those who suffered losses leaving Russia, so it's an open question whether they would want to try again even given Russia's vast oil and gas reserves. US.. major ExxonMobil saw its stake in the Sakhalin oil project unilaterally terminated and wrote off $3.4 billion. 

Russia's major oil companies have less need of foreign partners than they did in the immediate post-Soviet era, though smaller oil field services might want to return given the size of Russia's oil industry. But they would have to face new requirements on establishing local presence and investment, Weafer said. 

According to the Kyiv School of Economics, 2,329 foreign companies are still doing business in Russia, many from China or other countries that aren't allied with Ukraine, while 1,344 are in the process of leaving and 494 have exited completely. The Yale School of Management's Chief Executive Leadership Institute lists some two dozen U.S. companies still doing business in Russia, while some 100 more have cut back by halting new investments. 

U.S. sanctions are considered the toughest, because they carry the threat of being cut off from the U.S. banking and financial system. But the EU is still slapping new rounds of sanctions on Russia. Even if U.S. sanctions are dropped, EU sanctions would continue to present compliance headaches for any company that also wants to do business in Europe.

Secretary Pete Hegseth denied China's assertion that Golden Dome was an effort to turn space into a 'war zone,' arguing it was only for defense of the homeland.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued a stark warning Saturday at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore: China's military is ""rehearsing for the real deal,"" and a full-scale invasion of Taiwan ""could be imminent.""

""We are not going to sugarcoat it – the threat China poses is real,"" he added.

CHINA LAUNCHES LARGE MILITARY DRILLS AROUND TAIWAN TO ISSUE 'SEVERE WARNING'

Beijing swiftly rejected the allegation. Rear Admiral Hu Gangfeng, head of the Chinese delegation and vice president of China's National Defense University, called the remarks ""groundless accusations,"" stating that ""some of the claims are completely fabricated, some distort facts and some are cases of a thief crying ‘stop thief.'"" Despite such denials, a growing body of evidence suggests China may indeed be preparing for a military move against Taiwan.

Numerous indicators draw this conclusion. Here are nine:

1. China has intensified its joint sea and air exercises surrounding Taiwan, including rehearsals simulating blockades, encirclements, and amphibious assaults. These drills closely mirror operational strategies that would likely be employed in an actual invasion and are widely interpreted by analysts as concrete signals of Beijing's willingness to use force.

2. The Peoples' Liberation Army (PLA) has positioned H-6 bombers, capable of delivering nuclear payloads, on outposts such as Woody Island in the South China Sea. These platforms significantly extend China's strike capability and serve as strategic messaging to both Taipei and Washington.

3. China continues to conduct gray-zone operations aka non-kinetic forms of coercion, including cyberattacks on Taiwan's infrastructure, disinformation campaigns, and illegal incursions by maritime militia vessels. Though these actions fall below the threshold of open warfare, they are designed to wear down Taiwan's defenses and destabilize the region. 

4. According to U.S. intelligence assessments, Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed the PLA to be capable of launching an invasion of Taiwan by 2027. While not a confirmed deadline for action, it has catalyzed PLA modernization, emphasizing joint force integration and amphibious readiness. 

5. China's strategic expansion in Latin America – especially through Belt and Road investments and attempts to influence key nodes such as the Panama Canal reflect broader ambitions to project global power and encircle U.S. interests. These moves indirectly support Taiwan-related ambitions by distracting or overextending U.S. response capabilities.

6. Recent PLA exercises have incorporated civilian ferries capable of transporting tanks and personnel—suggesting preparations for amphibious operations on Taiwan's shores. The dual-use nature of these assets allows China to mask military buildup under the guise of civilian activity.

7. Beijing has intensified its political narrative around ""reunification,"" including state media coverage, educational reforms, and speeches by top Chinese officials. These ideological signals often precede military action in authoritarian regimes.

8, China has rapidly expanded its coastal infrastructure, including new docks, airstrips, and logistics hubs in Fujian Province—directly across the Taiwan Strait. Satellite imagery suggests these assets are optimized for a cross-strait operation.

9. Chinese fighter jets and warships have entered Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) at unprecedented levels. In early 2025 alone, PLA aircraft breached Taiwan's ADIZ over 1,200 times, prompting elevated readiness levels in Taipei.

The question of whether China will invade Taiwan is no longer hypothetical but a matter of timing and risk calculus. While Beijing continues to deny aggressive intent, the evidence suggests a sustained and deliberate military buildup with the intent to compel reunification—if not peacefully, then by force. 

Hegseth's warning reflects not alarmism, but a sober assessment of escalating realities. These indicators—military drills, strategic deployments, political rhetoric, and infrastructure mobilization—align with historical precedents for pre-invasion posturing.

The international community must take this threat seriously. Strengthening deterrence, improving intelligence sharing, and reinforcing Taiwan's self-defense capabilities are critical to avoiding a regional catastrophe. For the United States and its allies, readiness is no longer optional—it is a strategic imperative.

Dr. Devi Nampiaparampil joins 'Fox News Live' to discusses Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s MAHA report on childhood disease.

Sperm from a single donor in Europe has reportedly been used to conceive at least 67 pregnancies, although the donor carried a rare cancer-causing mutation.

The donor's mutation has been linked to cancer diagnoses in 10 of these children, according to a report by The Guardian.

The case was brought to light after two families separately contacted their fertility clinics after their children's cancer diagnoses were linked to a rare genetic variant called TP53.

PROSTATE CANCER RISK INCREASES BY 45% AMONG MEN WHO SHARE ONE TROUBLING BEHAVIOR

A mutation in the TP53 gene causes Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which increases the risk of developing cancer. Cleveland Clinic states that this disorder comes with a 90% chance of developing some type of cancer by age 60, and a 50% chance by the age of 40.

The European Sperm Bank, the sperm supplier, confirmed that this variant was present in some of the donor's sperm.

Researcher Dr. Edwige Kasper (not pictured) advocates for a European limit on the number of births or families for a single donor. (iStock)

The Guardian reported that the rare variant was ""not known to be linked to cancer at the time of donation in 2008.""

The genetic variant reportedly would not have been detectable through standard screening, and the donor is said to currently be in good health.

""The identified mutation is one that could not have been detected by the screening methods we use in accordance with regulations.""

Dr Edwige Kasper, a biologist at Rouen University Hospital in France, presented this case at the European Society of Human Genetics' annual conference in Milan last week, commenting on the need for a European limit on the number of births or families for a single donor.

""We can't do whole-genome sequencing for all sperm donors – I'm not arguing for that,"" she told The Guardian. ""But this is the abnormal dissemination of genetic disease. Not every man has 75 children across Europe.""

4 TROUBLING CANCER TRENDS YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT IN 2025

Kasper analyzed the mutation in her lab, concluding that it was most likely cancer-causing and that children born from this donor should ""receive genetic counseling.""

The research-turned-investigation tracked down 67 children from 46 families in eight European countries. The children were tested, with the variant detected in 23 of them.

The 10 who had been diagnosed with cancer reportedly included cases of leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Sixty-seven children from 46 families were identified from the donor in eight European countries.  (iStock)

In a statement sent to Fox News Digital, the European Sperm Bank stated that donor-assisted reproduction ""generally remains a significantly safer alternative"" than reproduction without genetic screening.

The bank added that sperm donors undergo a ""comprehensive health screening,"" which includes an in-depth medical examination, a review of the donor's family medical history and ""extensive"" testing for genetic and infectious diseases.

""However, it's not possible to rule out all risks — and, in this particular case, the identified mutation is one that could not have been detected by the screening methods we use in accordance with regulations and would require specialized genetic testing,"" the group noted.

Julie Paulli Budtz, VP. of corporate communications at the European Sperm Bank, expressed to Fox News Digital that they are ""deeply affected by this case.""

""The donor has been thoroughly tested even beyond the required standards, but preventative genetic screening is reaching its limits here,"" she said. 

""Every human being has about 20,000 genes, and it is scientifically simply not possible to detect disease-causing mutations in a person's gene pool if you don't know what you are looking for.""

Budtz noted that the European Sperm Bank welcomes ""continued dialogue"" regarding setting an ""internationally binding family limit,"" which they have advocated for ""on several occasions, also at EU level."" 

""This is also why, in addition to complying with national pregnancy limits, we have proactively implemented our own international limit of 75 families per donor,"" she added.

In the U.S., there is no official legal limit on how many sperm donations one man can make.

However, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) recommends that donors are limited to 25 live births within each population area of 800,000 people.

""Institutions, clinics and sperm banks should maintain sufficient records to allow a limit to be set for the number of pregnancies for which a given donor is responsible,"" the ASRM states on its website.

""Limiting donor vials is an important part of the process.""

California Cryobank, which has claimed to have the largest selection of sperm and egg donations in the country, states on its website that it closely monitors donors to limit the total number of family units to 20 to 30 worldwide. 

""Limiting donor vials is an important part of the process,"" the bank noted.

The U.S. Federal Drug Administration requires that all sperm donors undergo a physical exam, complete a questionnaire, provide their medical history, and undergo screenings for infectious diseases at an FDA-approved lab. (iStock)

The U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) requires that all sperm donors undergo a physical exam, complete a questionnaire, provide their medical history, and undergo screenings for infectious diseases at an FDA-approved lab.

In addition, the ASRM suggests that donors undergo psychological and genetic screening, and also recommends infectious-disease testing of the recipient and the recipient's sexually intimate partners, per its website.

""Legal consultation and laws may vary by state,"" the organization notes.

At California Cryobank, donors must be tested for infectious diseases, undergo genetic screening, get a psychological assessment and criminal background check, and receive screening for the Zika virus, according to the bank's website.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright recounted how Biden-era policies 'strangled' Alaska's energy growth during his address at the Reagan National Economic Forum.

SIMI VALLEY, CALIFORNIA – Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said that the Biden administration ""strangled"" the state of Alaska with restrictions and red tape that was beyond levels imposed on North Korea, Iran and Venezuela combined. 

""Alaska, a state that has had more sanctions, more restrictions on production of oil and gas in Alaska than everything we did to Iran and Venezuela and North Korea if they produced any combined. You know, the last administration just strangled Alaska. This awesome state of immense natural resources,"" Wright said from the Reagan National Economic Forum in Simi Valley, California. 

Wright joined the inaugural Reagan National Economic Forum on Friday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library to celebrate President Donald Trump's executive orders ""unleashing American energy"" and how the administration is tackling regulations that have prevented the growth of coal and nuclear energy in recent history. Fox News' Maria Bartiromo moderated the energy-focused panel. 

He pointed to the Gulf of America and Alaska as two key areas for American energy growth, most notably in the Last Frontier State.

""Alaska has been this great resource. It boomed and then it's been strangled. The idea is we export oil from the north slope of Alaska, comes by pipeline to southern Alaska, and then exported,"" he said. ""We want to build a pipeline from the north slope of Alaska that brings natural gas, not just oil. And then an oil, a natural gas export terminal on the southern coast of Alaska that in six days can sail to Tokyo or Taiwan or Korea. And then down to our allies in East Asia. So they're getting energy from us. But it would be awesome and great from a geopolitical stance to have a very short supply chain between a huge industrial American facility and our allies in East Asia.""

CHRIS WRIGHT CONFIRMED TO SERVE AS TRUMP'S SECRETARY OF ENERGY

Wright added that the Gulf of America is a key area of the country to build massive export terminals, where American energy can be exported to foreign nations. 

""The export terminals today are almost entirely on the Gulf of America, on the Texas and Louisiana coast. And they're there because you can build things there. The natural gas comes from Pennsylvania, Ohio or North Dakota or Texas or Oklahoma. The gas comes from all over. But that's where you can build these giant facilities to export it,"" he said.

China has launched a space probe that will travel to an asteroid near Mars to collect samples and find potential ""groundbreaking"" results.

The Tianwen-2 probe launched Thursday from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province aboard the workhorse Long March 3-B rocket, according to the China National Space Administration (CNSA).

The target of the Tianwen-2 will be different from its predecessor, the Tianwen-1, which launched a year ago and landed on Mars.

Tianwen-2 will be aiming for the asteroid 2016 HO3, which is also known as 469219 Kamoʻoalewa, to bring back samples.

The proposed 10-year plan would involve more than just this space mission as China continues to look to expand into space.

Zhang Rongqiao, chief designer of the Tianwen-1, told China Central Television he plans to implement the ""Tianwen-3"" Mars sampling return mission in 2028, while the ""Tianwen-4"" will head toward Jupiter.

According to The Associated Press, the asteroids, chosen for their relatively stable orbits, will hopefully offer clues about the formation of Earth, such as the origins of water.

Samples from 2016HO3 are due to be returned in about two years. 

Even if the CNSA is going to distribute these samples to international partners like they have on previous missions, NASA wouldn't be able to receive any samples.

A law passed in 2011, known as the Wolf Amendment, restricts NASA from having any cooperation with the CNSA.

A federal appeals court on Friday opted to keep in place a lower court's decision to block the Trump administration‘s sweeping federal workforce cuts under the Department of Government Efficiency.

The three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled 2-1 to deny the Trump administration's bid to stay the earlier order from the U.S. District Court for the North District of California. Judges William Fletcher, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, and Lucy Koh, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, ruled in the majority to deny the bid to unpause the mass workforce cuts.

In the lengthy decision, the court argued that the Trump administration failed to show the necessary factors to pause the lower court's order and expressed concern over the effects the cuts could have on government services. Fletcher, in the majority opinion, called the proposed cuts “an unprecedented attempted restructuring of the federal government and its operations.”

Judge Consuelo Callahan, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, dissented from the decision, and said she would have granted a stay of the lower court's order.

“Plaintiffs sued, bypassing the comprehensive administrative scheme that Congress has enacted to handle federal sector labor and employment disputes. The district court nevertheless entertained Plaintiffs' claims and concluded that the Executive's actions likely violate separation of powers—without making any finding that any agency's [reduction in force] is likely to violate any statute,” Callahan said in her dissent.

The court then entered a sweeping preliminary injunction that strips the Executive of control over its own personnel,” she added. “Because Defendants have shown a likelihood of success and irreparable harm, we should have stayed the preliminary injunction.”

SUPREME COURT ALLOWS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO END MASS PAROLE FOR MIGRANTS

The pause issued by the district court earlier this month was the latest of several Trump administration actions to be blocked by a federal court, as President Donald Trump faces a bevy of legal challenges to nearly all of his actions early into his second term.

The actions by district courts to stop the Trump administration's actions have led to the Supreme Court's emergency docket becoming flooded with requests from the administration to pause lower court orders.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","The long history and controversy of presidential autopen use","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3425049/autopen-history-and-controversy-presidential-use/","Sat, 31 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Many people first heard the term “autopen” when President Donald Trump accused his predecessor of using it illicitly earlier this spring.

“The ‘Pardons' that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen,” Trump wrote on March 17.

That accusation has now set off a full-blown investigation by the Republican-led House Oversight Committee as part of a wider set of questions about the Biden health cover-up that ensnares his family and his administration's top deputies.

But former President Joe Biden was far from the first president to use an autopen. In fact, the device is even older than the 82-year-old.

Autopen devices are used to generate signatures without the signer's input, and have been used for more than two centuries by politicians and other prominent figures with an in-demand John Hancock. As the name implies, the machine does not produce a stamp or copy of a signature, but creates one using an actual pen held by a machine. 

The first president to use one was Thomas Jefferson, who began using a rudimentary autopen soon after the device's invention in 1803. This iteration, developed by British-American inventor John Isaac Hawkins, was known as a polygraph and made instant copies of a signature or even entire letters as they were dictated.

Autopen has always been mildly controversial, implying an air of inauthenticity or even laziness on the part of its user. Most presidents who used them were not inclined to talk about it publicly, and the polygraph remained something of a state secret.

A more modern autopen was in use by the days of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and he used it frequently. An authentic Eisenhower signature today can fetch over $400, while an autopenned one is a nice souvenir with little monetary value.

The first true presidential autopen scandal belonged to President John F. Kennedy, the subject of an entire book dedicated to the matter. In The Robot That Helped to Make a President, author Charles Hamilton surmised that Kennedy's true signature was scarce.

“Picture a huge, faceless robot which grips a fountain pen in claws of steel,” Hamilton wrote. “At the push of a pedal, its hidden parts awake and its metal arm moves firmly and quickly over a sheet of paper to perform the very human function of scrawling a name. Tirelessly the robot works, signing thousands of letters, papers, and photographs.”

Kennedy's supercharged autopen use, the author believes, helped fuel his narrow victory over then-Vice President Richard Nixon in 1960, hence the book's name.

However, the Kennedy saga ironically destigmatized the autopen, and Kennedy's successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, became the first president to allow the device to be photographed. From then on, the device became an open secret.

By the 1970s, Nixon, now president, was so dependent on an autopen that it was one of the last things to go before the Watergate scandal forced him out of office.

“In August of 1974, on the verge of Nixon's resignation, White House staffers figured the end was coming,” presidential historian Craig Shirley said. “But they knew it was inevitable when he shut off the autopen.”

Historically, autopen had strict limits on its use. It was allowed for form letters or other communications, but never for high-profile functions such as signing legislation. This meant that bills were often flown out to the president if he was away and then carried back by a staffer to Washington.

In 2005, former President George W. Bush instructed his Department of Justice to check out what was legally required to sign a bill. The dispensation he received said that he could use the autopen to sign legislation if desired. But Bush backed down and, in one instance, rushed from Texas to Washington to sign in person a hot-button bill regarding medical treatment for Terri Schiavo, a Florida woman who was severely brain-damaged.

The DOJ's advice sat dormant for another six years.

Prior to 2025, the closest thing to a true autopen scandal occurred in 2011. Former President Barack Obama was aware of the 2005 dispensation and decided to use it midway through his first term.

Obama visited France for the 2011 G8 summit and, while there, needed to sign a bill extending the Patriot Act. Rather than fly back or have the bill flow to him, he had the autopen do it from 4,000 miles away. Obama used it again from Indonesia later that same year and from Hawaii in 2013.

That set off a mini-controversy, with critics pointing to the English 1677 Statute of Frauds to argue Obama could use an autopen to sign legislation only if he was in the same room as the device.

“Autopengate establishes a dangerous precedent, one that every thinking lawyer in Washington politics seemed to have overlooked,” lawyer Terry Turnipseed wrote for Slate. “Nobody should be signing bills for the president, not even when the president orders them to do so.”

“Can you imagine what mischief one could get into with the president's autopen at one's beck and call?” he added. 

Republicans complained then, but a court challenge to the practice never materialized.

Trump has acknowledged using the autopen himself, but he says Biden's aides may have used it without the former president's full knowledge to arrange pardons for themselves and sign executive orders.

“He autopenned almost everything,” Trump said. “Do you think he even knew that they were using an autopen?”

Those leading the charge say that autopen was not used to sign legislation, which Biden often did himself with cameras rolling, but rather executive actions and the last-minute pardons handed out to former White House COVID-19 adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci, former Wyoming GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, and several members of the House Jan. 6 committee.

Biden also pardoned family members, including Hunter Biden, James Biden, Sara Jones Biden, Valerie Biden Owens, John T. Owens, and Francis W. Biden. According to Oversight Project president Mike Howell, all of those are now in question.

“I think, ultimately, these [Biden aides] are involved in criminal activity,” Howell said in an interview with the Washington Examiner. “We don't think, one, he was allowed to delegate those decisions, and two, we did not think he had the capacity to delegate them even if he was allowed to.”

The Oversight Project's initial investigation helped bring Trump's attention to the issue, which is now probably the most high-profile controversy in the autopen's 222-year history.

Deadline looms for ex-Biden aides to comply with GOP autopen investigation

Of course, not everyone thinks Biden's use of an autopen should be controversial. Many see it as a distraction at best and a form of intimidation at worst, especially considering that so many signatures in today's world don't use a pen at all.

“I don't know the history of it, but I do think it's a bogus, ginned-up issue,” Rutgers University history, media studies, and journalism professor David Greenberg said. “These days, I sign all kinds of documents with an e-signature or even by putting my name in a cursive font in a regular Microsoft Word document. Autopen has been used in lots of ways without its validity ever being impugned.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

As President Donald Trump enters just his 132nd day in office on Saturday, our White House Report Card finds him in a good position.

The courts gave him wins on his tariff and immigration policy, inflation surprised by ticking down, he heralded a series of DOGE victories in bidding Elon Musk farewell, and he's getting ready to head the first modern-day military parade in Washington on June 14.

His approval rating is holding, more people than ever believe the country is heading in the right direction, and two-thirds of voters, even those who supported former Vice President Kamala Harris, like his America-first focus.

“The president's doing well,” said Democratic pollster John Zogby, one of our co-graders, though he also cited Trump's inability to nail down some really big victories.

Even more than in his first term, people view Trump as a glass half full or half empty. A Washington Post headline today, for example, screamed: “Trump plows ahead after one big, bad, sometimes ugly week full of setbacks.” At the Washington Examiner, Editor Hugo Gurdon and chief political correspondent Byron York headlined their video chat, “Trump's accomplishments getting the public's approval.”

In this week's report card, conservative Jed Babbin graded Trump's week a B-minus, noting that the “big, beautiful bill” faces hurdles in the Senate. Zogby graded it a C-minus and added a fun note that in a hypothetical election, Trump would win again.

Jed Babbin

Grade: B-

It was a pretty good week for President Donald Trump with his “Liberation Day” tariffs being struck down and quickly revived by the courts, his “One big, beautiful bill” — now OBBB — having a rocky time in Congress, and Canada asking to be covered by his Golden Dome missile defense.

Trump said Canada could get Golden Dome coverage — if it became the 51st state. The Canadians won't agree to that, but should pay tens of billions of dollars to be included.

The “Liberation Day” tariffs were struck down by a lower court and then restored at least for a while by the federal circuit. Meanwhile, Trump threatened iPhone tariffs if they're not made in the U.S. He's going to bring jobs back to the U.S. pretty much at any price.

The OBBB is having a rough time in the Senate. They'll probably amend it to death, and Trump will be stuck celebrating a bill that doesn't accomplish much of his agenda. The success of his second term depends on this bill and next year's budget reconciliation.

Trump's war with Harvard University continues. He and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have made progress by terminating student visa applications. Harvard's student body is at least 25% foreign.

Across the aisle, Democrats are leaderless with people such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) vying for the top spot. Which brings us to the wit and wisdom of Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA). He said that AOC is the reason we have directions on shampoo bottles.

Elon Musk quit the DOGE pseudo-agency which has done yeoman's work on cutting government waste. The hope is that DOGE will continue cutting and slashing away.

Meanwhile, Trump has, at long last, realized that Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn't want to make peace in Ukraine. What Trump does now may determine the freedom of Europe for the next 50 years.

John Zogby

Grade: C-

Is President Donald Trump trying to lead or simply to make one point after another?

This week witnessed the end of two bromances — one with fellow autocrat Vladimir Putin, the other with fellow narcissist Elon Musk.

Trump issued several pardons, including one for a former Chicago gang leader running a drug trade from prison, the other for reality stars Todd and Julie Chrisley. He said he is considering pardoning two men imprisoned for plotting to kidnap liberal Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. He and his sons have enriched themselves following a private dinner with cryptocurrency leaders at his New Jersey golf club.

One federal court blocked his policy of global tariffs, calling it “illegal,” but another paused that pause, allowing the president to continue for now.

A judge blocked Trump's efforts to stop Harvard University from enrolling foreign students. And the president, with the blessing of the Supreme Court, is ordering the deportation of about 3,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans who were here legally and called vital to the community's agriculture, poultry, and other industries. Curiously, these folks tend to be militantly anti-communist and conservative, and voted Republican when they achieve citizenship.

One poll seems to show Trump losing ground among young men. But a new poll by John Zogby Strategies does not find that at all. What's more, the president is in a dead heat or even slightly ahead against any of several possible Democratic contenders in 2028.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","USDA still discriminating against white farmers, watchdog says","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3426279/usda-still-discriminating-against-white-farmers-watchdog-says/","Sat, 31 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are still discriminating against white farmers despite a change in administration and the threat of litigation, a civil rights watchdog told the Washington Examiner, amid new whistleblower allegations accusing the agency of offering race-based loan relief under former President Joe Biden.

The Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty (WILL), a well-known constitutional law litigator, is threatening legal action against the Trump-selected Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins over racially discriminatory programming allegedly still in place at the USDA.

In February, Rollins issued a directive rescinding all of her department's DEI programs, declaring that the USDA is instead prioritizing equality, meritocracy, and color-blind policies. Since the start of President Donald Trump's second term, the USDA has been comprehensively reviewing DEI programming in an effort to reverse the “woke priorities of the Biden administration,” the agency said in a “First 100 Days” press release.

“We appreciate the Trump Administration's strong stance against DEI, but Secretary Rollins must take the discrimination at USDA much more seriously,” WILL's managing vice president and deputy counsel Dan Lennington urged. “If she doesn't, we will hold her accountable very soon in federal court. She has received fair warning from WILL and Congress.”

In early April, WILL sent Rollins a letter demanding she eliminate lingering racial and sex-specific preferences found within three USDA programs. The letter gave her 60 days to make these reforms or face a lawsuit.

For example, the Loan Guarantee Program guarantees farm loans for up to 95% against possible financial loss of principal and interest, allowing eligible farmers to borrow more money at a lower interest rate. WILL said women and racial minorities can receive a higher guarantee (as much as 95%) courtesy of persisting DEI policies, while white males may only get a guarantee of 90% of a loan's value under the standard plan. A lower guarantee means higher interest rates and loan costs and lower overall loan amounts, WILL explained.

The Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) Program offers financial assistance when the margin between the price of milk and the average feed cost falls below a coverage level picked by the producer. To participate in the program, USDA requires enrollees to pay an annual $100 administrative fee. However, WILL explained that the USDA only charges white male farmers the fee and exempts so-called “socially disadvantaged farmers,” as defined by the U.S. agriculture secretary, from having to pay the fee. USDA regulations currently define this phrase to include only ethnic minorities and women.

The Environmental Quality Incentives Program may award up to 90% of conservation project costs associated with planning, design, materials, equipment, installation, labor, management, maintenance, and training to “socially disadvantaged farmers.” White males, meanwhile, are only entitled to 75% of costs reimbursed under this program, WILL said.

Following no response from Rollins, on May 5, the entire Wisconsin congressional Republican delegation followed up with a second letter addressed to the U.S. agriculture secretary in support of WILL's demands. All five GOP Wisconsin congressmen called on Rollins to end these prejudiced practices.

USDA did not respond to this litigation threat. So in May, the GOP Congressional Delegation wrote this letter to @SecRollins @RepTiffany @RepTonyWied @RepFitzgerald @RepVanOrden @RepGrothman @RepBryanSteil /4https://t.co/seGAia644n pic.twitter.com/c4nD3POwVS

“We still have received no response and are preparing a federal lawsuit against Secretary Rollins,” Lennington told the Washington Examiner. “We don't quite know what is going on at USDA, but we can only assume that holdover staff from the Biden administration are protecting these race-based programs and allowing the discrimination to continue.”

In a statement shared with the Washington Examiner, a USDA spokesperson said, “Over the last four years, the Biden administration left USDA in complete disarray and disfunction and that's why farmers were being left behind.”

“The entire farm economy has been hurt by Biden's inaction,” the statement said. “It is absurd that while the Biden Administration was driving up inflation, American taxpayers were forced to fund billions in woke DEI initiatives. No one should be shocked that Biden weaponized bipartisan farm programs to discriminate and provide taxpayer dollars to one group based on race and not on merit.”

“Unlike the Biden Administration, under President Trump, USDA does not discriminate and single out individual farmers based on race, sex, or political orientation,” the spokesperson added. “Secretary Rollins is working to reorient the department to be more effective at serving the American people and put farmers first.” The Trump administration, for instance, rolled out programs, like the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which provides $10 billion in direct assistance to producers, and all farmers are encouraged to apply, the spokesperson said.

A provision of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Biden's signature COVID-19 stimulus legislation, offered loan forgiveness based on racial classifications. Farmers and ranchers must be black, Native American, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, an Alaskan native, or Pacific Islander in order to participate, the stipulations said.

In 2021, Lennington's law firm represented 12 farmers across nine states in a racial equality lawsuit challenging the Biden-era farmer loan forgiveness program, which WILL argued unconstitutionally excluded white farmers from accessing billions in relief-related benefits allocated on the basis of race. WILL won the case, with a federal court in Wisconsin issuing a nationwide injunction against the Biden administration. Accordingly, the U.S. Justice Department and USDA announced that they suspended this particular program in compliance with the court order and several other subsequent injunctions issued in courts around the country.

JUDGE HALTS MINORITY-ONLY USDA DEBT FORGIVENESS PROGRAM

This week, a USDA whistleblower came forward to allege that only minority farmers were sent an email explaining a new payment-and-loan-modification program was available specifically for them under Section 22006 of the Inflation Reduction Act, which provided $3.1 billion in relief for “distressed borrowers” who were delinquent on qualified loans.

A letter, dated January 2023, reportedly informed the recipients that this new programming exists, although the American Rescue Plan Act no longer grants the statutory authority to do so.

“You are receiving this letter because you were previously informed of your potential eligibility as a Farm Loan Programs borrower for a payment under Section 1005 of the American Rescue Plan Act,” the letter said, according to a copy obtained by NewsNation.

In a NewsNation interview, the whistleblower said none of the white farmers he works with received this notification and that USDA staffers were instructed to tell “socially disadvantaged farmers” to stop paying their loans because they would be forgiven.

“It was to pay off anyone who wasn't a white male,” the whistleblower told NewsNation. “That was the only qualification,” he added. “They were trying to keep this hushed because of the obvious implications of race-based loan forgiveness.”

Under Trump, Rollins directed the USDA to review IRA funding to ensure that programming is “focused on supporting farmers and ranchers, not DEI programs or far-left climate programs,” the USDA spokesperson told the Washington Examiner. As part of this course correction, Rollins has ended the four-year pandemic pause on debt collections. This overhaul includes terminating the “distressed borrowers” program and servicing those loans, the spokesperson said.

In response to the whistleblower's allegations, two ex-Biden officials have denied to the Daily Mail that white farmers were secretly discriminated against during the federal loan forgiveness process.

“Our guiding principle was doing everything we could to help farmers and ranchers in financial stress stay on the farm,” Biden's Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told the Daily Mail. Vilsack previously described such relief as a form of reparations for past perceived grievances. “For generations, socially disadvantaged farmers have struggled to fully succeed due to systemic discrimination and a cycle of debt,” Vilsack said when the American Rescue Plan Act passed.

USDA SET TO GIVE $2.2 BILLION TO MINORITY FARMERS BY END OF 2023

Former senior USDA policy adviser Scott Marlow, who led the implementation of the IRA's Section 22006, called the whistleblower claims “absurd” and “inflated.” Marlow, disputing that minority farmers were told to stop their loan payments, said there would have been “no way” for the USDA to keep white farmers off the mailing list. “All of those [programs] were implemented in a race-neutral way,” Marlow insisted. “In our administration, we actually abided by judges' [rulings] as required by law. Whether we liked it or not.”

But Lennington said his group is troubled by the whistleblower's claims. “Because if true,” he said, “it would mean that officials from both Biden's USDA and DOJ violated multiple federal court orders and victimized millions of white farmers around the country.”

WILL is calling on the Trump administration to investigate the latest whistleblower allegations “thoroughly and quickly.” If these claims are legitimate, Lennington said federal officials should take several corrective steps: notify all the victims of this discrimination “and offer to make them whole,” inform the federal courts that the Biden administration “intentionally violated” federal court rulings, and fire those responsible or otherwise hold them accountable.

“For those individuals who no longer are federal employees, USDA should work with Congress to hold hearings and expose the wrongdoing of the Biden era,” Lennington added.

The three programs WILL has flagged are not the only problematic programs remaining at the USDA, noted Lennington. According to WILL's report identifying areas of reform, titled the “Roadmap to Equality,” the USDA continues to operate at least two dozen racially selective initiatives.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Advice from Atlantic writers on dealing with the inevitable uncertainty of the next weeks and months

This is an edition of The Wonder Reader, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a set of stories to spark your curiosity and fill you with delight. Sign up here to get it every Saturday morning.

“History found you.” In 2020, Caitlin Flanagan told recent college graduates that their dreams were interrupted in much the same way her father's dreams had once been interrupted. In 1941, he was a new student at Amherst College, “and he thought it was paradise,” Caitlin wrote. Then the Pearl Harbor bombing happened, and he and his college peers enlisted in the Army the very next day.

History found both of these generations and left them with a whole lot of plans deferred, but perhaps also something great—“As very young people you know something powerful: that you have been tested, and you did not falter,” Caitlin wrote. “You kept going.”

Caitlin's essay is one of a series of commencement speeches The Atlantic commissioned in 2020 for students who would not be able to attend their graduation. In them, writers spoke to young people growing up in the shadow of loss, who were watching as humanity as a whole was tested. While 2025 isn't the same topsy-turvy reality as 2020, students still face a core uncertainty about what comes next. Below is a collection of honest, not-always-rosy, but often hopeful advice for the graduate in your life.

The series first made a name for itself by eschewing the blockbuster-franchise formula.

Every major movie franchise has boxes to check. In Jurassic Park, dinosaurs must run amok; in Planet of the Apes, apes have to meditate on intelligence; in The Fast and the Furious, Vin Diesel absolutely has to evangelize the benefits of family, Corona beers, and tricked-out cars. But Mission: Impossible took four films to fully establish its franchise must-have: the ever more blurred lines between its death-defying, stunt-loving star, Tom Cruise, and the superspy he plays. For more than a decade, the series was defined instead by its lack of definition—at least, beyond having Cruise in the lead role as Ethan Hunt, and Ving Rhames recur as Hunt's ally. Each installment felt made by a director with a specific take on the material, and Cruise was their versatile instrument.

But the four Mission: Impossible films that followed—culminating in the eighth and purportedly final installment, now in theaters—have taken a different approach. Instead of relying on a select few characters and story beats to link the films together, the movies have abided by a stricter canon. Mission: Impossible—The Final Reckoning, which earned a record-setting $63 million at the box office over its opening weekend, represents the most aggressive pivot away from the saga's more freewheeling origins: It self-seriously inserts supercuts of footage from its predecessors, reveals the purpose of a long-forgotten plot device, and turns a bit player from 1996's Mission: Impossible into a crucial character. In the process, it streamlines those earlier, delightfully unpredictable stories to the point of overlooking their true appeal.

That tactic may be familiar to today's audiences, who are used to cinematic universes and intersecting story threads, but the Mission: Impossible franchise initially distinguished itself by eschewing continuity. New cast members came and went. Hunt lacked signature skills and catchphrases. The movies were messy, and didn't seem interested in building toward an overarching plan. Yet in their inconsistency, they prove the value of ignoring the brand-building pressures that have become the norm for big-budget features today.

Read: The unbearable weight of Mission: Impossible

Like the 1960s television show on which they're loosely based, the early Mission: Impossibles were stand-alone stories. The first two movies in particular stuck out for their bold authorial styles. First came Brian De Palma's film, which he drenched in noir-ish flair while also deploying vivid color and Dutch angles. It arrived at a time when blockbusters such as Independence Day and Twister leveled cities and prioritized world-ending spectacle. Without a formula in place, De Palma got to challenge genre conventions—for instance, by mining tension out of mere silence during the central set piece, which saw Hunt's team staging a tricky heist.

The second film, 2000's Mission: Impossible II, went maximalist under the direction of John Woo, who punctuated almost every sequence with slow-motion visuals and dizzying snap zooms. The filmmaker also asserted that Hunt himself was malleable: Whereas in the first film, he fights off his enemies without ever firing a gun, in Woo's version, he's a cocksure Casanova mowing down his targets in hails of bullets. Woo also indulged in the action pageantry that De Palma had avoided—Mission: Impossible II seemed to contain twice the amount of explosions necessary for a popcorn film—but the climactic stunt is perhaps the smallest Cruise has ever had to pull off: When the villain stabs at Hunt with a knife, the point stops just before reaching his eye.

The two films that followed conveyed a similar sense of unpredictability. For 2006's Mission: Impossible III and 2011's Mission: Impossible—Ghost Protocol, Cruise, who also served as a producer, picked unconventional choices to direct: J. J. Abrams, then best known for creating twisty TV dramas such as Alias and Lost, took on the third entry, while Brad Bird, who'd cut his teeth in animation, handled Ghost Protocol. Like their more accomplished predecessors, both filmmakers were entrusted by Cruise and company to treat Mission: Impossible as a playground where they could demonstrate their own creative strengths.

Read: The sincerity and absurdity of Hollywood's best action franchise

Where De Palma and Woo focused on visual panache, Abrams and Bird stretched the limits of tone—and in doing so, revealed the adaptability of the franchise. Mission: Impossible III is unnervingly sobering amid its shootouts and double crosses; the film features a memorably chilling Philip Seymour Hoffman as the villain, a character's disturbing death, and a subplot about Hunt getting married. Ghost Protocol, meanwhile, is essentially a screwball comedy: Simon Pegg's character, Benji, provides a humorous button to many of the film's biggest scenes, and Bird treats Hunt like a marble caught in a Rube Goldberg machine packed with goofy gadgets, whether he's pinballing through a prison or being launched out of a car in the middle of a sandstorm. (Hunt even declares “Mission accomplished,” only for the film to play the line for laughs.)

In the years since Ghost Protocol, much of big-budget filmmaking has come to feel made by committee. Studios offer fans remakes, legacy sequels, and spin-offs that connect disparate story threads, bending over backwards to ensure that viewers understand they're being shown something related to preexisting media. (Just look at the title of the upcoming John Wick spin-off.) The new Mission: Impossible suffers by making similar moves. It struggles to make sense of Hunt's story as one long saga, yielding an awkwardly paced, lethargic-in-stretches film. The Final Reckoning insists that every assignment Hunt has ever taken, every ally he's ever made, and every enemy he's ever foiled have been connected, forming a neat line of stepping stones that paved the way for him to save the world one more time.

Taken together, the first four Mission: Impossibles were compellingly disorganized, a stark contrast with Hollywood's ever more rigid notion of how to construct a franchise. They didn't build consistent lore. Each new installment didn't try to top the previous one—a popular move that's had diminishing returns. Although some observers critique their varying quality, the lack of consensus emphasizes the singularity of each of these efforts. They remind me of the instances of an individual filmmaker's vision found amid major cinematic properties these days, such as Taika Waititi putting his witty stamp on a Thor sequel, Fede Alvarez turning Alien: Romulus into a soundscape of jump scares, and on television, Tony Gilroy ensuring that the Star Wars prequel Andor never included a single Skywalker. If the older Mission: Impossible movies now feel dated and incongruous—whether within the franchise itself or as part of the cinematic landscape writ large—that's to their benefit. They let creative sensibilities, not commercial ones, take the lead.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Panelists joined to discuss Donald Trump's willingness to mix public office with personal benefit.

Donald Trump's willingness to mix public office with personal benefit is facing scrutiny, as are his latest pardons. Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic joined last night to discuss how the president may be using his power to profit, and more.

Meanwhile, Trump's battle with Harvard continued this week. Panelists considered how that fight is being received by voters and Republican lawmakers—and whether the president's continued crackdown on higher education could have political consequences.

For Republicans, Trump's action against Harvard is “not something that they want to break with the president on,” Leigh Ann Caldwell said last night. “This is not an issue that they're willing to stand in front of him on, like most issues.”

Several mRNA vaccine trials found a debilitating side effect, and now the Trump administration is cutting funding for more research.

Solving HIV vaccination—a puzzle that scientists have been tackling for decades without success—could be like cracking the code to a safe. The key, they now think, may be delivering a series of different shots in a specific sequence, iteratively training the body to produce a strong, broad immune response that will endure against the fast-mutating virus, ideally for a lifetime.



Figuring out which ingredients to include in those shots, and in which order, is one of the trickiest immunological conundrums that researchers have ever faced. But mRNA, the fast, flexible technology that delivered two of the world's first COVID-19 vaccines in record time, is ideal for that kind of brute-force tinkering, and may be the most important tool for getting an effective HIV vaccine, Julie McElrath, the head of the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, in Seattle, told me. Multiple mRNA-based HIV vaccines are now in clinical trials, and early data suggest that they're prompting the type of immune responses that researchers think are essential to keeping HIV at bay—and that other vaccine candidates have struggled to elicit at all.



But recently, several promising mRNA HIV-vaccine candidates have slammed up against a technical roadblock. In two small clinical trials, 7 to 18 percent of participants developed rashes and other skin reactions after getting the shots—including multiple cases of chronic hives that troubled volunteers for months after they were immunized. All of the vaccines were manufactured by Moderna.



The rashes aren't life-threatening; they're also readily treatable. Still, they can be debilitating and distressing. “I've had patients who literally can't go to work,” Kimberly Blumenthal, an allergist and immunologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, who has treated people with chronic hives, told me. The rate at which they're occurring in the trials is also out of the norm, and no one has an explanation yet for the root cause. To prioritize patient safety, mRNA HIV-vaccine research in people has slowed as researchers try to suss out the cause of the hives, William Schief, the Scripps Research Institute biophysicist who helped design the vaccines, told me. (Schief also holds titles at Moderna and at IAVI, the nonprofit that sponsored some of the HIV-vaccine work.)



At any time, a side effect this uncomfortable and prolonged would give researchers pause. But in 2025, a setback for a high-profile mRNA vaccine trial—focused on HIV, no less—could more fundamentally upend potentially lifesaving research.



Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime and prominent anti-vaccine activist, has repeatedly questioned the safety of mRNA COVID vaccines. He and agency leaders are already recommending that fewer Americans take vaccines and creating new hurdles to vaccine approval. Since January, the National Institutes of Health, under HHS's direction, has also terminated funding for hundreds of research projects related to HIV and vaccines. This week, the department canceled Moderna's nearly $600 million contract to develop mRNA-based flu vaccines.



The HIV-vaccine studies that detected the skin reactions were also supported by NIH funding, and the researchers involved collaborated directly with NIH scientists. But those partnerships have since been terminated, and the NIH is now telling several agency-supported researchers working on HIV vaccines that the government is not planning to continue funding their work, according to several researchers I talked with.



When reached for comment, Emily Hilliard, HHS's press secretary, wrote in an email, “The reality is that mRNA technology remains under-tested, and we are not going to spend taxpayer dollars repeating the mistakes of the last administration, which concealed legitimate safety concerns from the public”—referencing the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, which were rigorously tested in clinical trials, and billions of doses of which have been safely administered people around the world.



Under normal circumstances, detecting rashes in a small vaccine-safety study would represent a routine scientific setback, and prove that the trials served their intended purpose. But the administration's anti-vaccine stances have created a culture of fear among scientists: Several of the researchers I contacted for this story declined to comment, for fear of publicly tying their name or institution to reporting on mRNA vaccines and losing funding for their research. Science requires resources and open discussion—in torpedoing both, the Trump administration is rapidly undoing decades of progress toward ending the HIV pandemic.





Researchers running the mRNA HIV-vaccine trials first took note of the rashes in 2022, shortly after studies began. After Science magazine reported about the side effect connected with the IAVI-sponsored vaccine, many scientists in the field weren't sure what to make of the finding. The trial in which it had been reported had enrolled only 60 people, and it wasn't set up to rigorously look at a mysterious side effect. “The sort of feeling was, Yeah, that's a bit weird, God knows what happened,” John Moore, an HIV researcher and vaccinologist at Cornell, told me. This April and May, though, researchers independently published two papers describing the rashes, for four separate vaccines, in two separate trials: one for the IAVI-backed vaccine and another run by the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. Now, the side effect is “real, confirmed, generalizable,” Moore said. “And we don't know why it's happening.”



The vaccines in question target slightly different parts of the virus. But all of them rely on a Moderna-manufactured mRNA backbone, and all of them triggered, in up to about 10 percent of participants, chronic hives that emerged a few days or weeks after vaccination and in many cases lasted for months. That's a long time to be battling itching and discomfort—and it threatens to be a major deterrent to completing the series of vaccines, or potentially starting at all, Genevieve Fouda, an immunologist and HIV researcher at Cornell, told me.



Delayed, chronic hives have long been known as a rare side effect of vaccines, including mRNA-based COVID vaccines. But the rates are generally very low—usually well under 1 percent, and often detectable only in massive studies of thousands of people. To see these rashes crop up in two small safety studies—one of 60 people, the other of 108—is a significant departure from precedent, scientists told me. And working out why they're appearing at such high rates will take time. Although researchers understand that the reactions are a kind of autoimmunity—in which the body inadvertently learns to attack itself—they don't know exactly why rashes occur after certain immunizations or infections, Blumenthal told me.



In this case, the data so far do point to the specific combination of mRNA and HIV as a root cause. Other mRNA vaccines, including Moderna's, haven't had this issue to anywhere near this degree; neither have other HIV vaccines that have made it into people. And several researchers pointed out to me that, so far, the only trials that they're aware of in which these hives have turned up at this frequency have involved a Moderna-manufactured product. None of the other vaccines being tested by the HIV Vaccine Trials Network, for instance, has seen rashes at that rate—including other, non-Moderna mRNA HIV vaccines, Jim Kublin, the director of HVTN, told me. (Barton Haynes, the Duke immunologist leading work on one of the non-Moderna vaccines, told me he and his colleagues have not encountered the same skin-reaction problem.) Hives also appear to have been a more common side effect of the Moderna COVID vaccines than of the Pfizer ones, though still overall rare. “This is truly an outlier in terms of what we've seen,” Robert Paris, a vice president at Moderna, told me.





A persistent mRNA problem would be a major blow to HIV-vaccine development. When the technology emerged, it sped progress like nothing else: “Things that originally took us about three years, we could do them in maybe three and a half months or so,” Mark Feinberg, the head of IAVI, told me. The early results for these vaccines have also been very promising, and before the hives were detected, researchers were well on their way to testing even more iterations of mRNA-based HIV vaccines, to crack the final immunization code. But for the moment, “there's no appetite to say, ‘Let's try all these different immunogens and see what happens,'” Schief, the Scripps researcher who helped design the vaccines, told me.



Still, most of the researchers I spoke with insisted that they'll find a solution soon. The mRNA vaccines for HIV “are not at all dead in the water,” Kublin told me. If needed, scientists could tweak the vaccine recipe, or combine the mRNA approach with another technology. The fix may be as simple as lowering the vaccine dose, a strategy that Schief and Feinberg are working to test in a new trial based in South Africa. (Moderna's COVID vaccine also contained more than three times as much mRNA as Pfizer's—and one study found that lowering the Moderna dose seemed to reduce the rate of certain skin reactions.)



Successful HIV vaccination may require a balancing act—minimizing hives, while still delivering enough mRNA to rile up the immune system. But researchers may not be able to drive the rates of skin reactions down to zero: HIV is especially adept at cloaking itself from the immune system, and there may be few ways to force the body to attack the virus without producing collateral damage. And Schief and others couldn't say what rate of hives would be acceptably low. The virus is so infectious and deadly that some minor side effects may be worth the risk, if the vaccine is effective at generating the right immune response. But even a perfect, immunity-inducing shot won't do the world any good if people are afraid to take it.



Still, if a rash can dissuade someone from vaccination, so, too, can misinformation, or an official's decision to stop recommending a shot. No vaccine progress will be made if the federal government doesn't want it to happen: Paris, of Moderna, told me that earlier this spring, the NIH terminated its partnership with the researchers developing these mRNA HIV vaccines, forcing the scientists to seek alternate sources of support. And yesterday, Schief and Haynes were told that their groups at Scripps and Duke would not have the opportunity to renew funding for the two HIV-vaccine-focused research consortia that their institutions lead—millions of dollars that the researchers had been told to expect they would receive, and that have been powering the development of their mRNA shots. The rationale, Haynes told me, as it was described to him, was “due to the desire to go with currently available approaches to eliminate HIV.” Currently available approaches include community education and preventive drugs, but notably, no vaccine. (HHS did not respond to questions about these funding shifts.)



“Unless we can find a substitute source of support, this work won't go forward,” Haynes told me. If the project of HIV vaccination looks less promising right now than it has in years, that's not about science or technology, or about any single side effect: It's about politics.

Not too long ago, Republicans believed in the rule of law, limiting the power of government, and protecting individual liberty. Then came Donald Trump.

Not too long ago, many Republicans proudly referred to themselves as “constitutional conservatives.” They believed in the rule of law; in limiting the power of government, especially the federal government; in protecting individual liberty; and in checks and balances and the separation of powers. They opposed central planning and warned about emotions stirred up by the mob and the moment, believing, as the Founders did, that the role of government was to mediate rather than mirror popular passions. They recognized the importance of self-restraint and the need to cultivate public and private virtues. And they had reverence for the Constitution, less as a philosophical document than a procedural one, which articulated the rules of the road for American democracy.

When it came to judicial philosophy, “constitutional conservatism” meant textualism, which prioritizes the plain meaning of the text in statutes and the Constitution. Justice Antonin Scalia excoriated outcome-based jurisprudence; judges should never prioritize their own desired outcomes, he warned, but should instead apply the text of the Constitution fairly. “The main danger in judicial interpretation of the Constitution—or, for that matter, in judicial interpretation of any law,” he said in 1988, “is that the judges will mistake their own predilections for the law.”

One of the reasons Roe v. Wade was viewed as a travesty by conservatives is that they believed the 1973 Supreme Court decision twisted the Constitution to invent a “right to privacy” in order to legalize abortion. The decision, they felt, was driven by a desired outcome rather than a rigorous analysis of legal precedent or constitutional text.

WHICH IS WHY it's hard to think of a more anti-conservative figure than President Donald Trump or a more anti-conservative movement than MAGA. Trump and his supporters evince a disdain for laws, procedures, and the Constitution. They want to empower the federal government in order to turn it into an instrument of brute force that can be used to reward allies and destroy opponents.

Read: In Trump immigration cases, it's one thing in public, another in court

Trump and his administration have abolished agencies and imposed sweeping tariffs even when they don't have the legal authority to do so. They are deporting people without due process. Top aides are floating the idea of suspending the writ of habeas corpus, one of the most important constitutional protections against unlawful detention. Judges, who are the target of threats from the president, fear for their safety. So do the very few Republicans who are willing to assert their independence from Trump.

In one of his first official acts, Trump granted clemency to more than 1,500 people charged in connection with the violent attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, including those convicted of seditious conspiracy. The president and his family are engaging in a level of corruption that was previously unfathomable. And he and his administration have shown no qualms about using the federal government to target private companies, law firms, and universities; suing news organizations for baseless reasons; and ordering criminal probes into former administration officials who criticized Trump.

The Trump administration is a thugocracy, and the Republican Party he controls supports him each step of the way. Almost every principle to which Republicans once professed fealty has been jettisoned. The party is now devoted to the abuse of power and to vengeance.

POLITICAL THEORISTS recognize that the governing approach of Trump and the GOP embodies the philosophy of Nietzsche and Machiavelli. It's all about the world of “Anything goes” and “Might makes right.” Laws and the Constitution are as malleable as hot wax; they can be reshaped as needed. Limited government has been traded for the Leviathan, and there are no constraints. The state has become a blunt-force instrument.

The significance of this shift can hardly be overstated. A party that formerly proclaimed allegiance to the Constitution and the rule of law, warned about the concentration and abuse of power, and championed virtue, restraint, and moral formation has been transmogrified. The Republican Party now stands for everything it once loathed.

Peter Wehner: America's Mad King

If this rot was confined to the GOP, it would be tragic but manageable. But Trump and the Republican Party control the levers of federal power. As a result, less than five months into Trump's second term, America is heading toward a form of authoritarianism.

We are still mid-story. The outcome is not ordained, and the courts are turning out to be, for the most part, a vital bulwark against Trumpism. The clashes will surely intensify as Trump rages against the storm. But as he does so, the resistance to him will grow and intensify too, and it will find expression in many different ways. The flame of liberty hasn't been extinguished quite yet.

Love of country is, as the historian Gertrude Himmelfarb said, an ennobling sentiment, worthy of our affections. And love of country demands that those who love America and her ideals stand up against a man and a party intent on destroying them.

From disaster warnings to drug development, how AI is generating real-world wins.

by  Bryan Walsh

Here's a selection of recent headlines about artificial intelligence, picked more or less at random:

For some recent graduates, the AI job apocalypse may already be here

Artificial intelligence threatens to raid the water reserves of Europe's driest regions

Top AI CEO foresees white-collar bloodbath

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

Okay, not exactly at random — I did look for more doomy-sounding headlines. But they weren't hard to find. That's because numerous studies indicate that negative or fear-framed coverage of AI in mainstream media tends to outnumber positive framings. 

And to be clear, there are good reasons for that! From disinformation to cyberwarfare to autonomous weapons to massive job loss to the actual, flat-out end of the world (shameless plug of my book here), there are a lot of things that could go very, very wrong with AI. 

But as in so many other areas, the emphasis on the negative in artificial intelligence risks overshadowing what could go right — both in the future as this technology continues to develop and right now. As a corrective (and maybe just to ingratiate myself to our potential future robot overlords), here's a roundup of one way in which AI is already making a positive difference in three important fields.

Whenever anyone asks me about an unquestionably good use of AI, I point to one thing: AlphaFold. After all, how many other AI models have won their creators an actual Nobel Prize? 

AlphaFold, which was developed by the Google-owned AI company DeepMind, is an AI model that predicts the 3D structures of proteins based solely on their amino acid sequences. That's important because scientists need to predict the shape of protein to better understand how it might function and how it might be used in products like drugs. 

That's known as the “protein-folding problem” — and it was a problem because while human researchers could eventually figure out the structure of a protein, it would often take them years of laborious work in the lab to do so. AlphaFold, through machine-learning methods I couldn't explain to you if I tried, can make predictions in as little as five seconds, with accuracy that is almost as good as gold-standard experimental methods. 

By speeding up a basic part of biomedical research, AlphaFold has already managed to meaningfully accelerate drug development in everything from Huntington's disease to antibiotic resistance. And Google DeepMind's decision last year to open source AlphaFold3, its most advanced model, for non-commercial academic use has greatly expanded the number of researchers who can take advantage of it.

You wouldn't know it from watching medical dramas like The Pitt, but doctors spend a lot of time doing paperwork — two hours of it for every one hour they actually spend with a patient, by one count. Finding a way to cut down that time could free up doctors to do actual medicine and help stem the problem of burnout. 

That's where AI is already making a difference. As the Wall Street Journal reported this week, health care systems across the country are employing “AI scribes” — systems that automatically capture doctor-patient discussions, update medical records, and generally automate as much as possible around the documentation of a medical interaction. In one pilot study employing AI scribes from Microsoft and a startup called Abridge, doctors cut back daily documentation time from 90 minutes to under 30 minutes. 

Not only do ambient-listening AI products free doctors from much of the need to make manual notes, but they can eventually connect new data from a doctor-patient interaction with existing medical records and ensure connections and insights on care don't fall between the cracks. “I see it being able to provide insights about the patient that the human mind just can't do in a reasonable time,” Dr. Lance Owens, regional chief medical information officer at University of Michigan Health, told the Journal.

A timely warning about a natural disaster can mean the difference between life and death, especially in already vulnerable poor countries. That is why Google Flood Hub is so important.

An open-access, AI-driven river-flood early warning system, Flood Hub provides seven-day flood forecasts for 700 million people in 100 countries. It works by marrying a global hydrology model that can forecast river levels even in basins that lack physical flood gauges with an inundation model that converts those predicted levels into high-resolution flood maps. This allows villagers to see exactly what roads or fields might end up underwater. 

Flood Hub, to my mind, is one of the clearest examples of how AI can be used for good for those who need it most. Though many rich countries like the US are included in Flood Hub, they mostly already have infrastructure in place to forecast the effects of extreme weather. (Unless, of course, we cut it all from the budget.) But many poor countries lack those capabilities. AI's ability to drastically reduce the labor and cost of such forecasts has made it possible to extend those lifesaving capabilities to those who need it most.

One more cool thing: The NGO GiveDirectly — which provides direct cash payments to the global poor — has experimented with using Flood Hub warnings to send families hundreds of dollars in cash aid days before an expected flood to help themselves prepare for the worst. As the threat of extreme weather grows, thanks to climate change and population movement, this is the kind of cutting-edge philanthropy.

Even what seems to be the best applications for AI can come with their drawbacks. The same kind of AI technology that allows AlphaFold to help speed drug development could conceivably be used one day to more rapidly design bioweapons. AI scribes in medicine raise questions about patient confidentiality and the risk of hacking. And while it's hard to find fault in an AI system that can help warn poor people about natural disasters, the lack of access to the internet in the poorest countries can limit the value of those warnings — and there's not much AI can do to change that.

But with the headlines around AI leaning so apocalyptic, it's easy to overlook the tangible benefits AI already delivers. Ultimately AI is a tool. A powerful tool, but a tool nonetheless. And like any tool, what it will do — bad and good — will be determined by how we use it.

One of the first women to graduate from the Army Ranger school says yes.

by  Victoria Chamberlin and  Noel King

Women weren't allowed to officially serve in combat jobs when Emelie Vanasse started her ROTC program at George Washington University. Instead, she used her biology degree to serve as a medical officer — but it still bothered Vanasse to be shut out of something just because she was a woman. 

“I always felt like, who really has the audacity to tell me that I can't be in combat arms? I'm resilient, I am tough, I can make decisions in stressful environments,” Vanasse said.

By 2015, the Obama administration opened all combat jobs to women, despite a plea from senior leaders in the Marine Corps to keep certain frontline units male only. Then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter told reporters that, “We cannot afford to cut ourselves off from half the country's talents and skills.”

The policy change meant that women could attend Ranger school, the training ground for the Army Rangers, an elite special operations infantry unit. When Capt. Kristen Griest and 1st Lt. Shaye Haver became the first women to graduate from the school in 2015, Vanasse taped their photos to her desk and swore she would be next, no matter what it took. She went on to become one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer and graduated from Ranger school in 2017. 

After the Pentagon integrated women into combat jobs, the services developed specific fitness standards for jobs like infantry and armor with equal standards for men and women. Special operations and other highly specialized units require additional qualification courses that are also gender-neutral. To continue past the first day of Ranger school, candidates must pass the Ranger Physical Fitness test, for which there is only one standard. Only the semi-annual fitness tests that service members take, which vary by branch, are scaled for age and gender.

Despite that, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has continued to insist that the standards were lowered for combat roles. In a podcast interview in November, Hegseth said, “We've changed the standards in putting [women in combat], which means you've changed the capability of that unit.” (Despite Hegseth's remark, many women worked alongside male infantry units in Iraq and Afghanistan, facing the same dangerous conditions.)

In the same interview, Hegseth said that he didn't believe women should serve in combat roles.

In March, Hegseth ordered the military services to make the basic fitness standards for all combat jobs gender-neutral. The Army is the first service to comply: Beginning June 1, most combat specialties will require women to meet the male standard for basic physical fitness, something most women serving in active-duty combat roles are already able to do.

Vanasse told Noel King on Today, Explained what it was like to attend Ranger School at a time when some men didn't want to see a woman in the ranks. 

What is Ranger School?

I went to Ranger School on January 1, 2017. I woke up at 3 am that day in Fort Benning, Georgia, shaved my head, a quarter-inch all the way around, just like the men. Took my last hot shower, choked down some French toast, and then I drove to Camp Rogers, and I remember being very acutely aware of the pain that the school would inflict, both physically and mentally. I was also very aware that there was kind of half of this population of objective graders that just kind of hated my guts for even showing up. 

They hated you for showing up because you're a woman?

Back in 2016 and 2017, it was so new to have women in Ranger School. I used to think, I don't have to just be good, I have to be lucky. I have to get a grader who is willing to let a woman pass. 

I had dark times at that school. I tasted real failure. I sat under a poncho in torrential rain and I shivered so hard my whole body cramped. I put on a ruck that weighed 130 pounds and I crawled up a mountain on my hands and knees. I hallucinated a donut shop in the middle of the Appalachian Mountains and I cried one morning when someone told me I had to get out of my sleeping bag. 

But I think all of those experiences are quintessential Ranger School experiences. They're what everyone goes through there. And I think the point of the school is that failure, that suffering, it's not inherently bad, right? In a way, I like to think Ranger School was the most simplistic form of gender integration that ever could have happened because if I was contributing to the team, there was no individual out there that really had the luxury of disliking or excluding me. 

When you wanted to give up, what did you tell yourself? What was going through your head? 

I don't think I ever considered quitting Ranger School. I just knew that it was something that I could get through and had the confidence to continue. I had a thought going in of What could be so bad that would make me quit? and the answer that I found throughout the school was, Nothing. 

Did you ever feel like they had lowered the standards for you compared to the men who were alongside you?

No. Never. I did the same thing that the men did. I did the same Ranger physical fitness test that all the men took. I ran five miles in 40 minutes. I did 49 pushups, 59 situps, six pullups. I rucked 12 miles in three hours with a 45-pound ruck. I climbed the same mountains. I carried the same stuff. I carried the same exact packing list they did, plus 250 tampons for some reason. At no point were the standards lowered for me. 

Whose idea was it for you to carry 250 tampons? 

It was not mine! It was a misguided effort to have everyone very prepared for the first women coming through Ranger School.

In Ranger School, there's only one standard for the fitness test. Everybody has to meet it, and that allows you to get out of Ranger School and say, “Look, fellas, I took the same test as the men and I passed.” 

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is saying that Army combat jobs should only have one standard of fitness for both men and women. And there's part of me that thinks: Doesn't that allow the women who meet the standards to be like, look, We met the same standards as the men. Nothing suspicious here, guys. 

I think gender-neutral standards for combat arms are very important. It should not be discounted how important physical fitness is for combat arms. I think there's nuance in determining what is a standard that is useful for combat arms, right? But it's an important thing. And there have been gender-neutral standards for combat arms. 

In things like Infantry Basic Officer Leader Course, which is the initial basic training for officers going into the infantry, there are gender-neutral standards that you have to meet: You have to run five miles in 40 minutes, you have to do a 12-mile ruck. All of those standards have remained the same. Pete Hegseth is specifically referring to the Army Combat Physical Fitness test, and to a certain extent I agree, it should be gender-neutral for combat arms. But I think there's nuance in determining what exactly combat arms entails physically.

Secretary Hegseth has a lot to say about women, and sometimes he says it directly and sometimes he alludes to it. What he often does is he talks about lethality as something that is critically important for the military. He says the Army in particular needs more of it, but he never really defines what he means by lethality. What is the definition as you understand it? 

There's a component of lethality that is physical fitness and it should not be discounted. But lethality extends far beyond that, right? It's tactical skills, it's decision-making, it's leadership, it's grit, it's the ability to build trust and instill purpose and a group of people. It's how quick a fire team in my platoon can react to contact. How well my SAW [Squad Automatic Weapon] gunner can shoot, how quickly I can employ and integrate combat assets, how fast I can maneuver a squad. All of those things take physical fitness, but they certainly take more than just physical fitness. There's more to lethality than just how fast you can run and how many pushups you can do.

To an average civilian like myself, I hear lethality and I think of the dictionary definition, the ability to kill. Does this definition of lethality involve the ability, physically and emotionally and psychologically, to kill another person? 

Absolutely. 

And so when Secretary Hegseth casts doubt on the ability of women to be as lethal as men, do you think there's some stuff baked in there that maybe gets to his idea of what women are willing and able to do?

Yes, possibly. I think the [secretary's] message is pretty clear. According to him, the women in combat arms achieved success because the standards were lowered for them. We were never accommodated and the standards were never lowered.

What's your response, then, to hearing the Secretary of Defense say women don't belong in combat? 

It makes me irate, to be honest. Like, it's just a complete discounting of all of the accomplishments of the women that came before us. 

Do you think that if Secretary Hegseth could take a look at what you did in Ranger School, and he could hear from you that there were no second chances, there were no excuses, there was no babying, the men didn't treat you nicer just because you were a woman, do you think he'd change his mind about women serving in combat? 

I'd like to think he would, but I've met plenty of people whose minds couldn't be changed by reality. I'd love it if he went to Ranger School. He has a lot of opinions about Ranger School for someone who does not have his Ranger tab.

What is a Ranger tab, for civilians? 

A Ranger tab is what you receive upon graduating Ranger School, which means you have passed all three phases and you are now Ranger-qualified in the military.

You have that. And the Secretary of Defense doesn't. 

He does not, though he has a lot of opinions about Ranger School.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Yes, you can watch all of the French Open for free with these live streaming options.","https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/streaming/how-to-watch-french-open-live-stream-free-2025-b","Sat, 31 May 2025 07:00:36 GMT","

The year's second Grand Slam is underway in France as we head into the third round on the clay courts of Roland-Garros, Paris. We've rounded up everything you need to know about how to watch a French Open live stream, including multiple free options.

Keep reading to learn about viewing options from around the globe. Even seasoned tennis fans should take notice, as some countries have changed channels from last year.

The free options highlighted below will require a VPN to watch from outside their broadcast country, but we can show you how to do this further down the page.

US: TNT/truTV

Notable matches:

Want to access those free options but aren't actually in France or Australia? You can still tune in with the help of a VPN. Short for virtual private networks, VPNs are cybersecurity tools that enable you to change your electronic device's virtual location.

They're popular apps among those looking to access their usual websites and services while traveling abroad or upgrade their online security. ProtonVPN is a great place to start, thanks in no small part to its impressive security features and 30-day money-back guarantee.

This early in the tournament, when there are so many matches on at once, I've found France has the best selection, even getting involved with the doubles coverage. Some Australian coverage is limited to replays, but they'll get more live matches the deeper we get into the competition.


                      Need a low-cost VPN packed with useful features and servers in 110+ countries? Then don't miss these ProtonVPN deals with a sizable 66% discount on a two-year plan at $3.39 a month. If you'd prefer a shorter-term, the one-year plan is great value too and only $3.99 a month. If you only want a rolling one-month deal, Proton is much cheaper than the competition at $9.99. All plans can be used across 10 devices at once and feature a great ad-blocker, split tunneling, and more security-conscious features.
                    

All the items below also have a free streaming option to be unlocked from anywhere with a VPN. Set it to the corresponding country, and you're all set.

Instead of NBC and Peacock, US French Open coverage will air across TNT and truTV this year. American cord-cutters have a few options to explore when tuning in without cable. You can live stream the channels through a live TV streaming service like Sling TV or DirecTV, or try out Max. Select coverage will also be available through the Tennis Channel, but the bulk of the action will be on Warner Bros. properties.

TNT is available through both of Sling TV's base plans, Sling Orange and Blue, which carry anywhere from 35-40+ channels. Sling Orange also carries ESPN, while Sling Blue offers local channels in select regions. Subscriptions start at $46/month, but new users can get 50% off their first month. DirecTV also carries TNT and about 25 other key sports channels in its MySports pack. The package also includes automatic access to ESPN Plus. New users can try out the service for free for five days.


                      DirecTV's MySports pack carries popular sports channels, from mainstays like ESPN to niche offerings like the ACC Network. 
                    


                          For just the essentials without any extra fluff, Sling TV is the streaming service you're looking for. It's more customizable than other plans, with three options you can choose from, so you pay for only what you need. New members often get a chunky discount on their first month.
                        
                      

Max, formerly HBO Max (and soon to be HBO Max again), will live stream French Open matches through its B/R Sports Add-on. This add-on is only available with ad-free plans, which start at $17/month. For more bang for your buck, you can opt for one of the Disney Plus bundles. Ad-free Disney Plus, Hulu, and Max are available for $30/month.

The streaming options also look a bit different for UK viewers this year. Instead of Eurosport, the TNT Sports coverage will be available to live stream through Discovery Plus. The Premium tier, which costs £31/month, is required to watch TNT. This option offers live streaming for several sports, including motorsport, Champions League, and UFC. Other than France and the UK, coverage remains on Eurosport for the rest of Europe.

In Australia, the French Open will be available through 9Now. The start of the tournament should air live on 9's Gem channel, and viewers can live stream coverage for free through 9Now. Users just need to create a free account if they don't already have one, and then they're all set to start watching.

The French Open will be shown on France TV in France. The service has a free live streaming counterpart, France.TV, which just requires account creation to use. The streamer sometimes prioritizes French contestants if there are multiple matches on.

So far, though, we've seen an excellent selection of simultaneous coverage with no gaps for the big players and many lesser-known ones, making it our top pick of all the options.

Note: The use of VPNs is illegal in certain countries and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal use of VPNs.

Iran manufactured a record volume of uranium enriched just below the levels needed for nuclear weapons, complicating efforts to negotiate a peaceful resolution to international concerns over the Islamic Republic's atomic ambitions. 

In its first report since US President Donald Trump's administration began negotiations with Tehran, the International Atomic Energy Agency said its accumulation of highly-enriched uranium rose by almost 50% to 409 kilograms (902 pounds) over the last three months. That volume of material could quickly be enriched to form the core of about 10 nuclear bombs, should Iran choose to pursue weapons.

When people talk about algorithmic traders, it evokes images of rooms full of math PhDs creating complex models that place huge trades in milliseconds after economic or earnings data is released. But now, it's retail traders who are turning in droves to automated trading, building the kind of programs in their basements more associated with Wall Street banks than the Reddit thread r/wallstreetbets.

Using these systems, though, has a downside: they can result in predictable, herd-like behavior, with data from Cboe Global Markets showing trades clustered at certain times of day. There's a risk that more sophisticated market participants could exploit the predictability of small-volume traders at specific moments when retail demand for options spikes.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

President Donald Trump said he would be increasing tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50% from 25%, saying the move would help protect American workers, as he visited a United States Steel Corp. plant on Friday.

Trump had gone to the plant near Pittsburgh to champion an expected deal between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel Corp. as one that would ensure the iconic American firm remains US-owned and operated, even as many details on the agreement remain vague. He said the steel tariff increase would benefit the new venture's American operations.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Senator Lindsey Graham's vow to act on a bill imposing new sanctions on Russia is set to test whether President Donald Trump is finally ready to punish Vladimir Putin for delaying a ceasefire with Ukraine. 

On a visit to Kyiv on Friday, Graham signaled he's tired of waiting for Trump to come around, saying he believes the Senate will “start moving” the sanctions bill next week. His proposal would ratchet up already smothering sanctions on Russia, including by slapping a 500% tariff on imports from countries that buy Russian oil products and uranium.

Iran carried out secret nuclear activities with material not declared to the U.N. nuclear watchdog at three locations that have long been under investigation, the watchdog said in a wide-ranging, confidential report to member states seen by Reuters.

The findings in the ""comprehensive"" International Atomic Energy Agency report requested by the agency's 35-nation Board of Governors in November pave the way for a push by the United States, Britain, France and Germany for the board to declare Iran in violation of its non-proliferation obligations.

A resolution would infuriate Iran and could further complicate nuclear talks between Tehran and Washington.

Using the IAEA report's findings, the four Western powers plan to submit a draft resolution for the board to adopt at its next meeting the week of June 9, diplomats say. It would be the first time in almost 20 years Iran has formally been found in non-compliance.

Tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and has long denied accusations by Western powers that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.

While many of the findings relate to activities dating back decades and have been made before, the IAEA report's conclusions were more definitive. It summarized developments in recent years and pointed more clearly towards coordinated, secret activities, some of which were relevant to producing nuclear weapons.

It also spelled out that Iran's cooperation with IAEA continues to be ""less than satisfactory"" in ""a number of respects."" The IAEA is still seeking explanations for uranium traces found years ago at two of four sites it has been investigating. Three hosted secret experiments, it found.

The IAEA has concluded that ""these three locations, and other possible related locations, were part of an undeclared structured nuclear programme carried out by Iran until the early 2000s and that some activities used undeclared nuclear material"", the report said.

Nuclear material and/or heavily contaminated equipment from that program was stored at the fourth site, Turquzabad, between 2009 and 2018, it said.

""The Agency concludes that Iran did not declare nuclear material and nuclear-related activities at three undeclared locations in Iran, specifically, Lavisan-Shian, Varamin, and Turquzabad,"" the report said.

At Lavisan-Shian in Tehran, a disc made of uranium metal was ""used in the production of explosively-driven neutron sources"" at least twice in 2003, a process designed to initiate the explosion in a nuclear weapon, the report said, adding that it was part of ""small-scale"" tests.

The report is likely to lead to Iran being referred to the U.N. Security Council, though that would probably happen at a later IAEA board meeting, diplomats said.

More immediately, it is likely to lead to Iran again accelerating or expanding its rapidly advancing nuclear programme, as it has done after previous rebukes at the board. It could also further complicate talks with the United States aimed at reining in that program.

A separate IAEA report sent to member states on Saturday said Iran's stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% of weapons grade, had grown by roughly half to 408.6 kg. That is enough, if enriched further, for nine nuclear weapons, according to an IAEA yardstick.

Both IAEA reports said enrichment to such a high level was ""of serious concern"" since it is the only country to do so without producing nuclear weapons.

Israel, which has long urged strong action against Iran's nuclear programme, said the IAEA report showed Tehran was determined to complete its nuclear weapons programme. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the world should act now to stop Iran from doing this.

U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA have long believed Iran had a secret, coordinated nuclear weapons programme that it halted in 2003. Iran denies ever having had one.

SINGAPORE — Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth on Saturday warned that the U.S. was prepared to ""fight and win"" against China if deterrence efforts failed, while urging Asian allies to strengthen military coordination and raise defense spending.

Speaking at the annual defense summit Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, U.S. Defense Secretary Hegseth stressed Washington's resolve to bolster defense capabilities at a time when regional warfare has flared up around the world, including Russia's war in Ukraine and the military conflict in Gaza.

While playing up the U.S.' commitment to the Indo-Pacific region, Hegseth took swipes at the absence of China's defense minister. ""We are here this morning. Somebody else isn't,"" he said.

Hegseth urged political and defense leaders in the audience to act with urgency in pushing back against China's mounting military pressure in the South China Sea and around Taiwan.

""China has demonstrated that it wants to fundamentally alter the region's status quo. We cannot look away and we cannot ignore it. China's behavior toward its neighbors and the world is a wake up call and an urgent one,"" said Hegseth.

""We ask, and indeed, we insist that our allies and partners do their part on defense,"" said Hegseth, adding that ""our defense spending must reflect the dangers and threats that we face today, because deterrence doesn't come on the cheap.""

The sharp rhetoric comes against the backdrop of increasing trade frictions between Washington and Beijing as optimism over a deal following a temporary tariff truce secured earlier this month wanes.

U.S.-China trade talks ""are a bit stalled,"" and would warrant the two countries' heads to weigh in, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News Thursday.

China's activities in the South China Sea undermine sovereignty and threaten freedom of navigation and overflight while its ongoing military operations near Taiwan signal a clear intent to escalate pressure on the island, the Pentagon leader said.

He also vowed to step up security nearer to the U.S., eliminating China's ""malign"" influence over Panama Canal. ""It is key terrain, after all, China did not build that canal. We did, and we will not allow China to weaponize it or control it.""

China in March said it was prepared to fight ""any type of war"" with the U.S., as President Donald Trump ratcheted up economic and political pressure on the country. ""If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we're ready to fight till the end,"" the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. said in a post.

China's Defense Minister Dong Jun was absent from this year's summit — the first time Beijing's top military official has skipped the event since 2019. Beijing instead sent a lower-ranking delegation, led by Major General Hu Gangfeng, Vice President of National Defense University of People's Liberation Army.

Major General Hu is expected to participate in a special session later Saturday on cooperative maritime security in the Asia-Pacific.

The absence of China's top military official has cast doubts over whether there will be a bilateral meeting between Chinese and the U.S. defense officials.

Last year then-U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Dong held a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the security forum, where both sides agreed to maintain military dialogue.

The absence of Beijing's defense minister could be an attempt to avoid engagement and conflict with the U.S. on flashpoints like Taiwan and the South China Sea, experts said.

""Beijing always wants to control the narrative and discourse. Shangri-La does not enable that,"" said Drew Thompson, senior fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies and a former U.S. official at the Defense Department.

""When I was at DoD, my PLA counterpart once explained to me what they didn't like. He said, 'we don't like being made out to be gladiators fighting one another for others' entertainment. We want to deal with our differences bilaterally, in channels, not in public forums,'"" he added.

Beijing sees limited strategic benefits in sending its top defense officials to the annual summit, instead it is focused on deepening ties through alternative forums without U.S. presence, Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, told CNBC earlier this month. That's according to CNBC's translation of his comments in Mandarin.

The U.S. government plans to ramp up weapon sales to Taiwan to a level beyond the $18.3 billion authorized during Trump's first term, surpassing the $8.4 billion approved under President Biden, according to Reuters.

The proposed arms packages will focus on cost-effective systems such as missiles, munitions, and drones, as part of an effort to enhance Taiwan's deterrence capabilities as Beijing ramps up pressure on the democratic island.

The U.S. has been an important ally and arms supplier to Taiwan for decades, with Beijing calling on Washington to halt such actions and stop creating tensions in the Taiwan Strait.

Beijing claims Taiwan as its territory and has vowed to ""reunify"" with the democratically governed island, by force if necessary. Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims.

For years, China has been steadily ramping up its military pressure to assert its sovereignty claims over Taiwan, regularly sending aircraft and naval vessels near the island.

Dong warned at the Shangri-La Dialogue last year that any forces aimed at separating Taiwan from China would face ""self-destruction"" and stressed the Taiwan issue as ""the core of our core interest.""

Concerns have mounted over Trump's commitment to the island too. On the election campaign trail, Trump had suggested Taiwan should pay for U.S. protection and accused it of siphoning off America's semiconductor industry, raising alarm in Taipei.

In this article

During the depths of the Covid pandemic, with restaurants around the country facing an existential crisis, DoorDash CEO Tony Xu had an unconventional proposal. He wanted to cut commissions.

Chief Business Officer Keith Yandell worried that such a move would result in a massive hit to profits ahead of the company's planned IPO. But Xu made a persuasive case.

""If restaurants don't thrive, we cannot,"" Yandell told CNBC in a recent interview, recalling Xu's perspective at the time. ""We need to take a leadership position.""

The company ended up sacrificing over $100 million in fees, Xu later said.

Since starting DoorDash on the campus of Stanford University in 2013, the now 40-year-old CEO has navigated the notoriously cutthroat and low-margin business of food delivery, building a company that Wall Street today values at close to $90 billion. The stock has emerged as a tech darling this year, jumping 23%, while the Nasdaq is still down for the year largely on tariff concerns.

More than four years after its IPO, net profits remain slim. But that's not getting in the way of Xu's mission to become an industry consolidator, using a combination of cash and new debt to fuel an acquisition spree at a time when big tech deals remain scarce. Earlier this month, DoorDash scooped up British food delivery startup Deliveroo for about $3.9 billion and restaurant technology company SevenRooms for $1.2 billion.

""What we've delivered for a customer yesterday probably isn't good enough for what we will deliver for them today,"" Xu told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" after the deals were announced.

This week DoorDash announced the pricing of $2.5 billion in convertible debt, and said the proceeds could be used in part for acquisitions.

The San Francisco-based company has a history with scooping up competitors to grow market share. In 2019, it bought food delivery competitor Caviar for $410 million from Square, now known as Block. About two years later, DoorDash said it was paying $8.1 billion for international delivery platform Wolt. The deal was its last big transaction until this month.

When DoorDash entered the food delivery market, it had to face off against the likes of GrubHub and Seamless, which later joined forces. That combined entity was bought late last year by restaurant owner Wonder Group. In 2014, Uber launched Uber Eats, which is now DoorDash's biggest competitor in the U.S.

""It's a very competitive market, and I think merchants do have choice,"" Xu said in the CNBC interview. ""What we're focused on is always trying to innovate and bring new products to match increasing standards and expectations from customers.""

DoorDash didn't make Xu available for an interview for this story, but provided a statement about the company's acquisition strategy.

""We're very picky, very patient, and conscious that, for most companies, deals don't work out in hindsight,"" the company said. ""When we see an opportunity that brings value to customers, expands our potential to empower local economies around the world, and has a path to strong long-term returns on capital, we tend to push our chips in.""

DoorDash differentiated itself early on by cornering suburban markets that had fewer delivery options, while other players attacked city centers. When Covid shut down restaurant dining in early 2020, DoorDash capitalized on the booming demand for deliveries. Revenue more than tripled that year, and grew 69% in 2021.

Colleagues and early investors credit a customer-first focus for much of Xu's success. Gokul Rajaram, who joined DoorDash through its Caviar acquisition, described Xu as ""the best operational leader in the U.S."" after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

Restaurants haven't universally viewed DoorDash as an ally. Commissions can reach as high as 30%, which is a hefty cut to fork over. Many restaurants have reluctantly paid the high fees because of DoorDash's dominant market share, which reached an estimated 67%. In 2021, the company introduced three tiers of pricing, with a basic option at 15% for more price-sensitive businesses.

DoorDash needs the high fees in order to stay in the black. The company's contribution profit as a percentage of total marketplace volume hovers below 5%.

Colleagues who have known Xu for decades say the food delivery entrepreneur hasn't changed much since the early days of the company.

Yandell said Xu once took advice from his young daughter, who complained about a routing issue while accompanying him on food delivery orders. All employees, including Xu, are required to complete orders and handle support calls every year as part of the company's WeDash program.

In a part of the country known for the pomp of its wealthy founders, Xu has a very different reputation.

Early workers recall memories of Xu pulling up in a dilapidated green 2001 Honda Accord to team events, or participating in company knockout basketball games referred to as ""knockys,"" next to the animal hospital in Palo Alto, which DoorDash briefly called its headquarters. Xu also personally approved every offer for the company's first 4,000 employees.

Xu spends many mornings answering customer service complaints. He often drops his kids off at school and, after tucking them in at night, hops on calls with international regions, colleagues say. Xu is an avid Gold State Warriors basketball fan but has a soft spot for the Chicago Bulls, having spent many years in Illinois. Once or twice a week, Xu squeezes in a morning run, and will often do so while traveling to explore different neighborhoods and stores.

Xu was born in China and moved with his family to Champaign, Illinois, in 1989. Growing up, he played basketball and mowed lawns to save up for a Nintendo. He told Stanford's View From the Top podcast in 2021 that the experience, and watching his parents hustle, taught him how to ""earn your way into better things.""

His ""characteristics became the company's values,"" said Alfred Lin, an early DoorDash investor and partner at venture firm Sequoia.

Xu often attributes his entrepreneurial spirit to his parents. His mother worked as a doctor in China, and juggled three jobs in the U.S. for over a decade, saving up enough to eventually open a medical clinic. His father worked as a waiter while pursuing a Ph.D. Xu said on the podcast that watching his mom gave him a deep understanding of what it takes to run a small business, which came in handy in DoorDash's early years as he was trying to convert restaurants into customers.

Employees say Xu has a reputation for detecting hidden talents among his colleagues. Jessica Lachs, the company's chief analytics officer, was working as a general manager assisting with DoorDash's Los Angeles launch when Xu guided her toward her passion for data.

""He believes in leaning into the things you're really good at, rather than trying to be mediocre at a lot of things,"" she said.

After Toby Espinosa, DoorDash's ads vice president, lost a deal with a major fast food company during his early years at the startup, Xu told him to work ""10 times harder"" and become an expert in his field. A few years later, the company secured the partnership, Espinosa said.

Grit and struggle defined the early years of DoorDash. The founding team of four managed deliveries around Stanford and Palo Alto though a Google Voice number directed to their cellphones.

DoorDash emerged out of a Stanford business school course known as Startup Garage, taught by Professor Stefanos Zenios. The class requires students to present a business idea, test it, and then pitch it to investors.

Zenios said Xu stood out with his data-driven approach and natural leadership qualities. The team tested two different ideas, including a platform that helped small businesses better track the effectiveness of their marketing, he recalls. Zenios called the idea to target suburban areas a ""brilliant insight.""

Xu and his team entered Y Combinator in the summer of 2013. The three-month startup accelerator program is known for spawning companies like Airbnb, Stripe and Reddit. Every session culminates with a demo day in front of some of Silicon Valley's biggest investors.

The DoorDash idea excited Paul Buchheit, creator of Gmail and a partner at Y Combinator. But like many other potential investors, Buchheit was skeptical about the economic model.

""You had a talented team of founders working on what I thought was an idea that had potential,"" he said. ""That's basically the formula for a good startup.""

On pitch day, the company failed to lure any venture firms, but Buchheit later participated as a seed investor.

Shortly after demo day, DoorDash encountered Saar Gur of Charles River Ventures. Gur had been looking for a food delivery platform to back and was conducting due diligence on another company when a friend led him to DoorDash.

By the end of their first meeting, they were ""finishing each other's sentences,"" Gur said.

Sequoia's Lin initially passed on DoorDash after the Y Combinator pitch, but kept in touch with the team. Lin said he wanted to see data that showed the platform could penetrate beyond Stanford and Palo Alto, and retain customers. He ended up leading two institutional rounds, attaining a 20% stake for Sequoia at the time of the IPO.

""Tony always believed that his company would succeed, or they'll find a way to succeed,"" Lin said.

Shortly after its Y Combinator stint, DoorDash hit an early roadblock. Following a Stanford football game, a rush of orders bombarded its delivery system causing massive delays, Xu told Y Combinator's CEO Garry Tan in an interview this year.

The founders refunded the orders and spent the night baking cookies, then driving them to customers early the next morning.

Oren's Hummus co-owner Mistie Boulton said DoorDash still takes that approach. The team comes to meet with her every quarter and she serves as a beta tester for new products.

The restaurant, which started in Palo Alto and has since expanded to a half-dozen locations across the Bay Area, was one of DoorDash's first clients, latching onto the opportunity to reach more customers beyond its small establishment that frequently had lines snaking out the door. 

""We just fell in love with the idea,"" Boulton said. ""The number one thing that encouraged and enticed me to want to work with them was Xu's passion. He really is one of those people that you can count on.""

Wall Street is now counting on Xu's ability to execute big deals, even with the company having this month surpassed $10 billion in delivery orders worldwide.

The acquisition of Deliveroo, based in London, marks a renewed effort by DoorDash to expand its presence overseas, following the purchase of Finland's Wolt three years ago.

The cash deal for SevenRooms, a New York City-based data platform for restaurants and hotels to manage booking information, takes DoorDash into an entirely new category. Xu told CNBC that DoorDash is a ""multi-product company now that's operating on a global scale.""

Following the acquisition announcements, which coincided with a disappointing earnings report in March, analysts at Piper Sandler reiterated their hold recommendation on the stock.

One reason for concern, they said, was that ""integrating multiple acquisitions at once may create some noise near-term.""

Parenting advice has gotten really complicated. There's something new every day, and it's filled with contradictions. Every time you think you understand something, it changes. All of this is a huge source of anxiety for many parents.

As a psychiatrist on the front lines of healthy youth development, I've worked with over 3,000 young adults. And as a mom of three kids, I've spent two decades on both sides of the journey through parenthood.

But parenting doesn't have to be complicated. Here are five simple rules to help you navigate the way-too-much-counterproductive-information age.

Evolution didn't prepare you to drive a car or negotiate a mortgage, but it did prepare you to be a parent, much more so than most people realize.

This means parenting is an area of adult life where it really is okay to follow a hunch and do what feels right. Think about going outside on a cold day. If you feel cold, do you consult a chart or a professional before reaching for a jacket? No. You just kind of know how to stave off hypothermia even if, like most people, you have never experienced it.

Parenting is much closer to intuitively bundling up on a cold day than it is to signing your first mortgage. It's okay to trust your instincts, although they're not going to prepare you for every little thing. That's where culture comes in.

Any culture that has survived more than a couple of hundred years has robust child-rearing traditions. And any enduring culture has answers for parents — traditions around feeding, rest, socialization, purpose and the transition to adulthood.

Now, you probably don't think of your own cultural heritage in this way, you probably just think about it as whatever old-fashioned stuff your parents did. Not sure what they did? Ask them! Older siblings, cousins, aunts and uncles are also great.

Who would I not listen to? Someone who has never met you or your child, who knows nothing about your value system, or is selling you something — or all three.

All kids are different. Some like singing, some like trucks. For the latter, spending half the day riding the city bus can be paradise. Pediatricians often recommend singing classes because many kids enjoy singing, and there is evidence that it's good for language development.

But if you take kid who loves trucks to a singing class, you might make a lot of people unhappy, starting with yourself and your kid.

Do you know what else is good for language development? Spending half the day watching a construction site! Many construction vehicles have names that are long and difficult to pronounce, but a kid who likes heavy machinery will outstrip your truck vocabulary in a week or two. You'll find yourself wondering why you have never contemplated questions like: What's the difference between a backhoe and an excavator?

One of the great joys of parenthood is seeing the world through their eyes. Follow them as often as you can.

You're raising a kid, not a spreadsheet, so leave the developmental tables to the teachers and pediatricians. That stuff is important for screening purposes, but can cause a lot of unnecessary anxiety.

Child development rolls out in fits and spurts, not in a perfectly linear fashion. If your kid seems basically okay, they are probably basically okay. (See rule #1!) If they don't seem okay, consult with your child's pediatrician or teacher, depending on the issue.

But many parents could benefit from dialing up the joy and dialing down the obsessing. With kids, enjoyment is development. They learn best when they are happy and relaxed, and engaged in playful activities with people who care about them.

What your child needs more than anything is your love and attention. Parents tie themselves in knots trying to be perfect. It's not necessary, and it's not authentic.

It's okay to show a range of emotions, as long as you don't lose control. This is how children learn that emotions are normal, and to manage their own. Kids are constantly bathed in emotions, and emotional modulation is one of their most important developmental tasks.

Worried parents tend to think our times present a unique set of challenges for raising kids, which is true. But it's also true that every generation of parents since time immemorial has had the same worry, and they got through. So will you.

The European Union on Saturday criticized President Donald Trump's move to double tariffs on steel imports, warning that it ""undermines"" efforts to reach a ""negotiated solution"" in the ongoing trade war.

""We strongly regret the announced increase of U.S. tariffs on steel imports from 25% to 50%,"" an EU spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News.

""This decision adds further uncertainty to the global economy and increases costs for consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,"" the spokesperson continued.

The spokesperson added that the EU is ""prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to the latest U.S. tariff increase.""

The United Steelworkers union (USW) also criticized Trump's announcement and said it is a ""direct attack on Canadian industries and workers.""

""Thousands of Canadian jobs are on the line and communities that rely on steel and aluminum are being put at risk,"" Marty Warren, United Steelworkers National Director for Canada, said in a statement.

""Canada needs to respond immediately and decisively to defend workers.""

Trump on Friday announced that he planned on doubling tariffs on steel imports to 50% from 25%, increasing the pressure on manufacturers dependent on industrial metals for production.

The new import duties are set to go into effect June 4.

His announcement, made at a rally at U.S. Steel in Pennsylvania, came after the president signaled earlier this month that he would approve a controversial deal between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel.

Trump highlighted an ""agreement"" between Nippon and U.S. Steel during the Friday rally, but said that the deal was not yet final.

He said that there will be no layoffs and ""no outsourcing whatsoever"" due to the deal.

The EU, which said that it had paused its countermeasures against the U.S. on April 14 ""to allow time and space"" for negotiations, said it is prepared to instate those measures ""if no mutually acceptable solution is reached.""

""The European Commission is currently finalizing consultations on expanded countermeasures,"" the spokesperson said. ""If no mutually acceptable solution is reached, both existing and additional EU measures will automatically take effect on 14 July — or earlier, if circumstances require.""

The Trump administration's tariff plan hit a snag this week after the U.S. Court of International Trade halted nearly all of Trump's country-specific tariffs on the grounds that he had exceeded his authority.

The court's order to cancel the tariffs was swiftly paused, at least for now, by an appeals court.

Despite the pause, the ruling has thrown a wrench into the administration's broader trade strategy, which relies on the threat of high tariffs to create leverage and force countries to renegotiate their trade deals with the U.S.

China's manufacturing activity contracted in May for a second month, an official survey showed on Saturday, fueling expectations for more stimulus to support the economy amid a protracted trade war with the United States.

The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) improved slightly to 49.5 in May from 49.0 in April but stayed below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction, in line with a median forecast of 49.5 in a Reuters poll.

On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump accused China of violating a two-way deal to roll back tariffs and unveiled a doubling of worldwide steel and aluminium tariffs to 50%, once again rattling international trade.

""Recent developments between China and the United States suggest bilateral relations are not improving,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.

""Firms in China and the United States with exposure to international trade have to run their business under persistently high uncertainty. It will weigh on the growth outlook in both countries.""

The new orders sub-index rose to 49.8 in May from 49.2 in April, while the new export orders sub-index rose to 47.5 from 44.7.

Some firms reported a noticeable rebound in trade with the United States, with improvements in both imports and exports, said senior NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe.

The non-manufacturing PMI, which includes services and construction, fell to 50.3 from 50.4, staying above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction.

Analysts expect Beijing to deliver more monetary and fiscal stimulus over the coming months to underpin growth and insulate the economy from the tariffs.

Interest rate cuts and a significant liquidity injection were among the easing steps unveiled by the central bank this month.

Beijing and Washington have agreed to a 90-day pause during which both would cut import tariffs, raising hopes of easing tension. Still, investors worry negotiations will be slow amid persistent global economic risks.

Trump's decision to single out China in his global trade war has stirred major worries about an economy that has been reliant on an export-led recovery to drive momentum in the face of weak domestic demand and deflationary pressures.

On Monday, rating agency Moody's maintained its negative outlook on China, citing unease over tensions with major trade partners that could have a lasting impact on its credit profile.

However, it acknowledged that government policy had tackled its previous concerns about the health of state-owned firms and local government debt that prompted a downgrade in late 2023.

China's economy expanded faster than expected in the first quarter, and the government has maintained a growth target of about 5% this year, but analysts fear U.S. tariffs could drive momentum sharply lower.

Exports beat forecasts in April, buoyed by demand for materials from overseas manufacturers who rushed out goods to make the most of Trump's 90-day tariff pause.

In this article

Sarah Kapnick started her career in 2004 as an investment banking analyst for Goldman Sachs. She was struck almost immediately by the overlap of financial growth and climate change, and the lack of client advisory around that theme.

Integrating the two, she thought, would help investors understand both the risks and opportunities, and would help them use climate information in finance and business operations. With a degree in theoretical mathematics and geophysical fluid dynamics, Kapnick saw herself as uniquely positioned to take on that challenge.

But first, she had to get deeper into the science.

That led her to more study and then to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the nation's scientific and regulatory agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce. Its defined mission is to understand and predict changes in climate, weather, oceans and coasts and to share that knowledge and information with others.

In 2022, Kapnick was appointed NOAA's chief scientist. Two years later, JPMorgan Chase hired her away, but not as chief sustainability officer, a role common at most large investment banks around the world and a position already filled at JPMorgan.

Rather, Kapnick is JPMorgan's global head of climate advisory, a unique job she envisioned back in 2004.

Just days before the official start of the North American hurricane season, CNBC spoke with Kapnick from her office at JPMorgan in New York about her current role at the bank and how she's advising and warning clients.

Here's the Q&A: 

(This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.) 

Diana Olick, CNBC: Why does JPMorgan need you?

Sarah Kapnick, JPMorgan global head of climate advisory: JPMorgan and banks need climate expertise because there is client demand for understanding climate change, understanding how it affects businesses, and understanding how to plan. Clients want to understand how to create frameworks for thinking about climate change, how to think about it strategically, how to think about it in terms of their operations, how to think about it in terms of their diversification and their long-term business plans.

Everybody's got a chief sustainability officer. You are not that. What is the difference?

The difference is, I come with a deep background in climate science, but also how that climate science translates into business, into the economy. Working at NOAA for most of my career, NOAA is a science agency, but it's science agency under the Department of Commerce. And so my job was to understand the future due to physics, but then be able to translate into what does that mean for the economy? What does that mean for economic development? What does that mean for economic output, and how do you use that science to be able to support the future of commerce? So I have this deep thinking that combines all that science, all of that commerce thinking, that economy, how it translates into national security. And so it wraps up all these different issues that people are facing right now and the systematic issues, so that they can understand, how do you navigate through that complexity, and then how do you move forward with all that information at hand?

Give us an example, on a ground level, of what some of that expertise does for investors.

There's a client that's concerned about the future of wildfire risk, and so they're asking, How is wildfire risk unfolding? Why is it not in building codes? How might building codes change in the future? What happens for that? What type of modeling is used for that, what type of observations are used for that? So I can explain to them the whole flow of where is the data? How is the data used in decisions, where do regulations come from. How are they evolving? How might they evolve in the future? So we can look through the various uncertainties of different scenarios of what the world looks like, to make decisions about what to do right now, to be able to prepare for that, or to be able to shift in that preparation over time as uncertainty comes down and more information is known

So are they making investment decisions based on your information?

Yes, they're making investment decisions. And they're making decisions of when to invest because sometimes they have a knowledge of something as it's starting to evolve. They want to act either early or they want to act as more information is known, but they want to know kind of the whole sphere of what the possibilities are and when information will be known or could be known, and what are the conditions that they will know more information, so they can figure out when they want to act, when that threshold of information is that they need to act.

How does that then inform their judgment on their investment, specifically on wildfire?

Because wildfire risk is growing, there've been a few events like the Los Angeles wildfires that were recently seen. The questions that I'm getting are could this happen in my location? When will it happen? Will I have advanced notice? How should I change and invest in my infrastructure? How should I think about differences in my infrastructure, my infrastructure construction? Should I be thinking about insurance, different types of insurance? How should I be accessing the capital markets to do this type of work? It's questions across a range of trying to figure out how to reduce vulnerability, how to reduce financial exposure, but then also, if there are going to be risks in this one location, maybe there are more opportunities in these other locations that are safer, and I should be thinking of them as well. It's holistically across risk management and thinking through risk and what to do about it, but then also thinking about what opportunities might be emerging as a result of this change in physical conditions in the world.

But you're not an economist. Do you work with others at JPMorgan to augment that?

Yes, my work is very collaborative. I work across various teams with subject matter experts from different sectors, different industries, different parts of capital, and so I come with my expertise of science and technology and policy and security, and then work with them in whatever sphere that they're in to be able to deliver the most to the bank that we can for our clients.

With the cuts by the Trump administration to NOAA, to FEMA, to all of the information gathering sources — we're not seeing some of the things that we normally see in data. How is that affecting your work?

I am looking to what is available for what we need, for whatever issue. I will say that if data is no longer available, we will translate and move into other data sets, use other data sets, and I'm starting to see the development out in certain parts of the private sector to pull in those types of data that used to be available elsewhere. I think that we're going to see this adjustment period where people search out whatever data it is they need to answer the questions that they have. And there will be opportunities. There's a ton of startups that are starting to develop in that area, as well as more substantial companies that have some of those data sets. They're starting to make them available, but there's going to be this adjustment period as people figure out where they're going to get the information that they need, because many market decisions or financial decisions are based on certain data sets that people thought would always be there.

But the government data was considered the top, irrefutable, best data there was. Now, how do we know, when going to the private sector, that this data is going to be as credible as government data?

There's going to be an adjustment period as people figure out what data sets to trust and what not to trust, and what they want to be using. This is a point in time where there is going to be adjustment because something that everyone got used to working with, they now won't have that. And that is a question that I'm getting from a lot of clients, of what data set should I be looking for? How should I be assessing this problem? Do I build in-house teams now to be able to assess this information that I didn't have before? And I'm starting to see that occurring across different sectors, where people are increasingly having their own meteorologist, their own climatologist, to be able to help guide them through some of these decisions.

Final thoughts?

Climate change isn't something that is going to happen in the future and impact finance in the future. It's something that is a future risk that is now actually finding us in the bottom line today.

LAS VEGAS — The bitcoin treasury play that lifted Strategy's market cap past $80 billion is now being mimicked by meme stock companies, media firms, and multinational conglomerates. But Wall Street isn't buying all the hype.

This week, Trump Media announced plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, and GameStop revealed a $500 million allocation. Meanwhile, Tether, SoftBank, and Strike's Jack Mallers unveiled Twenty One, a bitcoin-native public company expected to launch with more than 42,000 bitcoin on its balance sheet, enough to make it the third-largest corporate holder of the asset globally.

For now, the market doesn't see the next Strategy in any of them. Trump Media shares have dropped more than 20% since the announcement, while GameStop is down nearly 17%. Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has multiplied by 26 times since the end of 2022, amassing a bitcoin stake worth over $60 billion.

""Maybe the market wanted them to buy more bitcoin,"" said Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor in an interview at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas. ""But these are short-term dynamics. Over the long term, bitcoin on the balance sheet has proven to be extraordinarily popular.""

Saylor called Trump Media's move ""courageous, aggressive, and intelligent"" — and said the flood of similar announcements marks a global shift in corporate finance.

""Everywhere I go at this conference, someone says, you know, I'm working on a bitcoin treasury company in Hong Kong. I'm doing this thing in Korea. I've got this thing I'm working on in Abu Dhabi. We're going to do this in the Middle East, you know, we've got this in the U.K.,"" he said. ""There's an explosion of interest right now.""

Saylor said bitcoin ambassadors are ""planting the orange flag everywhere on earth.""

What began as a fringe financial maneuver is quickly becoming a geopolitical race. Under the Biden administration, corporate bitcoin adoption was often treated as a regulatory red flag. But under President Donald Trump, the tone has changed.

In March, Trump signed an executive order establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, instructing federal agencies to treat bitcoin as a long-term store of value. The reserve will be funded entirely through bitcoin seized in criminal and civil forfeiture cases, according to White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks. The order also empowers the government to explore additional budget-neutral mechanisms for acquiring more bitcoin.

For the first time, the federal government will conduct a full audit of its digital asset holdings, currently estimated at more than 200,000 bitcoin. The order explicitly prohibits the sale of any bitcoin from the reserve, cementing its role as a permanent sovereign asset.

Vice President JD Vance this week became the first sitting vice president to address the bitcoin community directly, framing crypto as a hedge against inflation, censorship, and ""unelected bureaucrats."" And in a further move to boost bitcoin, the Department of Labor rolled back guidance that had discouraged bitcoin investments in retirement plans.

""No force on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come,"" Saylor said. ""Bitcoin is digital capital and maybe the most explosive idea of the era.""

Some corners of the corporate world are still resistant. Late last year, Microsoft shareholders rejected a proposal to use some of the software company's massive cash pile to follow Saylor's lead. In a video presentation supporting the effort, Saylor told investors that ""Microsoft can't afford to miss the next technology wave.""

While Strategy has reaped the rewards of early adoption, Saylor suggested the market's cooler reaction to Trump Media and GameStop may stem more from structural financing dynamics than from skepticism toward bitcoin itself.

He pointed to GameStop's initial announcement that it was considering a bitcoin strategy, which led to a 50% pop in the stock and tenfold increase in trading volume. The company quickly capitalized on the momentum with a $1.5 billion convertible bond raise — a move he described as ""extraordinarily successful."" Trump Media took a similar approach, raising capital through a large convertible bond offering.

Saylor said those financing methods can create short-term downward pressure, but that over time investors will benefit.

When it comes to Strategy, Saylor said there's no ceiling to his bitcoin accumulation plans. His company is already by far the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency.

""We'll keep buying bitcoin,"" he told CNBC. ""We expect the price of bitcoin will keep going up. We think it will get exponentially harder to buy bitcoin, but we will work exponentially more efficiently to buy bitcoin.""

For critics who worry that state and media actors embracing bitcoin will undermine its decentralized ideals, Saylor argues the opposite.

""The network is very anti-fragile, and there's a balance of power here,"" he said. ""The more actors that come into the ecosystem, the more diverse, the more distributed the protocol is, the more incorruptible it becomes, the more robust it becomes, and so that means the more trustworthy it becomes to larger economic actors who otherwise would be afraid to put all of their economic weight on the network.""

Consumers who hoped tariffs would not hit their wallets keep getting bad news.

As they reported earnings in recent weeks, multiple major retailers said they have already raised some prices or plan to hike them in the coming weeks to offset the duties. They include major grocers and consumer goods sellers Costco, Best Buy, Walmart and Target.

President Donald Trump's ever-changing trade policy has roiled retailers as they try to plan their supply chains. On earnings calls, they faced the difficult task of trying to appease investors who want them to protect their bottom lines and shoppers who could balk at price hikes.

In some cases, companies have been explicit, citing the estimated toll tariffs will take on their bottom lines and breaking down which countries their supply chains rely on. Other retailers have been less forthcoming, avoiding the word ""tariff"" and instead blaming strategy shifts or price hikes on ""macroeconomic uncertainty"" — or simply refusing to point the finger at all.

Many retailers have reduced or withdrawn their full-year guidance because of tariffs. Companies such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Macy's and Best Buy have slashed their profit outlooks. Meanwhile, American Eagle, Canada Goose, Ross and Mattel pulled their full-year guidance.

After Trump implemented steep tariffs on dozens of countries in April, his administration has temporarily cut them to lower — but still significant — levels. Imports from China face a 30% duty, while goods from many other nations are subject to a 10% duty. A federal trade court struck down many of those tariffs on Wednesday, only for an appeals court to reinstate them, adding to the uncertainty retailers face.

Economists on both sides of the aisle agree that tariffs are inflationary and the cost will likely be passed on to consumers, though government data has not showed a clear effect yet. A majority, 68%, of U.S. CEOs say they have either increased prices already or are considering doing so this year in the face of tariffs, according to a new survey by Chief Executive Group and AlixPartners.

Here's a breakdown of what several major retailers have said about their plans to raise prices as a way to mitigate the tariff impact.

Costco

Executives of the warehouse club retailer told investors on Thursday that tariffs have forced the company to tweak its supply chain and raise prices in some cases. Costco has absorbed tariff costs for some goods, while it has increased prices in other instances, said CFO Gary Millerchip. For example, he said the retailer has held prices steady for staple items like bananas and pineapples sourced from Central and South America. Meanwhile, it has raised prices on flowers from those regions, since shoppers buy those less frequently.

Best Buy

Best Buy has already raised prices on some items to offset tariff costs, CEO Corie Barry said on a call with reporters. Changes took effect by mid-May. She declined to say which items are affected and called price hikes ""the very last resort"" for Best Buy.

SharkNinja

On SharkNinja's latest earnings call in May, CEO Mark Barrocas said the company has already increased prices for several of its key products in response to tariffs and will ""continue to look for additional opportunities"" to do so. As an example, he said the company recently raised the price of one of its Ninja espresso machines from $499 to $549 and saw ""no degradation in demand."" Some price hikes will stick and others will be dialed back, he said, depending on how consumers react.

In a March interview, Barrocas told CNBC that nearly all of the company's production will be moved out of China by the end of 2025.

Newell Brands

Executives from Newell Brands, which owns stroller company Graco as well as Rubbermaid, Yankee Candle, Paper Mate and Sharpie, said during an April 30 earnings call that the company has raised prices on its baby gear by about 20%. The company said it is equipped to handle Trump's tariffs, unless he raises duties on imports from China again, since the majority of baby gear sold in the U.S. is made in China.

Walmart

Walmart shoppers will likely see price increases toward the end of May and more in June because of tariffs, said Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey during an interview with CNBC earlier in May. Executives did not specify during the company's most recent earnings call how much more Walmart customers could pay, but CEO Doug McMillon said items that could be affected are toys, electronics and some grocery items, including bananas, avocados, coffee and roses.

Nike

Last week, Nike said it will raise prices on a wide range of products by June 1. Nike apparel and equipment for adults will increase between $2 and $10, a person familiar with the matter previously told CNBC, while footwear will see a hike between $5 and $10, depending on price point. The company did not say whether the decision was related to tariffs, though it makes about half its footwear in China and Vietnam, which currently face 30% and 10% duties, respectively.

Target

Target will increase prices on certain products to help offset tariff costs, Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said during the company's latest earnings call in May. CEO Brian Cornell added that price changes are the ""very last resort"" for the company as it tries to mitigate effects of the duties. He declined to provide details when asked about the company's plan for price hikes or whether it had already raised prices.

""We're constantly adjusting pricing,"" Cornell said. ""Some are going up, some will be reduced, but that's an ongoing effort that takes place each and every day.""

Mattel

Barbie parent Mattel said it will raise prices on some U.S. products ""where necessary"" to help offset levies. CEO Ynon Kreiz said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" in May that the company plans to source less than 40% of its products from China by the end of the year and less than 25% from that country in the next two years.

Macy's

Macy's CEO Tony Spring said during an interview with CNBC that the retailer will hike certain prices and stop carrying other items to offset the hit from tariffs. He said the company will make ""surgical"" price adjustments.

Ralph Lauren

Executives on Ralph Lauren's May earnings call said the company is taking ""selective pricing actions and strategic discount reductions"" to help manage tariff impacts. CFO Justin Picicci said that Ralph Lauren is ""assessing additional pricing actions"" for the fall and next spring to mitigate tariffs. This is on top of the ""proactive pricing"" the company had already planned for the fall in North America and Asia. Executives said no single country accounts for more than 20% of the brand's production volumes and most countries, including China, represent a single-digit percentage.

VF Corp

CEO Bracken Darrell said during May earnings that VF Corp, which includes brands The North Face, Vans, Timberland and Dickies, is going to be ""very strategic"" about pricing in response to tariffs. CFO Paul Vogel added that the company's plans to offset the tariff impacts include cost management, sourcing relocations and ""pricing actions."" Vogel said that the company's top four sourcing countries are Vietnam, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Indonesia, in that order, and that China accounts for less than 2% of the company's total costs coming into the U.S.

Home Depot

Last week, Home Depot broke away from the other retailers when CFO Richard McPhail told CNBC in an interview that the company intends to ""generally maintain our current pricing levels across our portfolio."" He said more than half of what the company sells comes from the U.S. Home Depot has diversified its sourcing, he said, so that by this time next year, no single country outside of the U.S. will account for more than 10% of the retailer's purchases.

At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, attendees questioned the effects of Trump's meme coin.

LAS VEGAS — At bitcoin's biggest event of the year, the Trump administration was omnipresent. Vice President JD Vance was the keynote speaker at the Bitcoin 2025 conference Wednesday, President Donald Trump's sons Eric and Donald Jr. appeared on multiple panels, and a delegation of White House advisers including crypto czar David Sacks praised crypto as the future of technology.

The crypto community is used to being treated with skepticism and scorn from many politicians and lawmakers. But a warm embrace from the Trump White House still hasn't erased some crypto investors' skepticism.

As Trump has been loosening government oversight and regulations around cryptocurrency, he has also waded into his own crypto project: the $TRUMP coin. Earlier in May, Trump hosted a private dinner at his Washington, D.C.-area golf club for top $TRUMP coin buyers, who on average spent more than $1 million per seat and sparked widespread concern about opportunities for influence-buying.

The $TRUMP coin is what industry professionals call a meme coin — meaning it offers little technical innovation or practical use and that its value is extremely volatile, relying on cultural cachet and symbolism.

To many serious investors in bitcoin or other established cryptocurrencies, meme coins are seen as a hazard to the long-term success of crypto. On the conference floor, some bitcoin holders predicted that crypto novices would lose money on the $TRUMP coin, hurting the reputation of the entire industry. While many attendees liked Trump's crypto policies, they weren't sold on his coin.

“A lot of them will get burned to leave and never come back — which I think is a terrible outcome, and I don't like it,” said Seth for Privacy, the vice president of crypto wallet software company Cake Wallet. The host of a privacy podcast, he declined to share his last name and is known online as Seth for Privacy. 

“Obviously, the best-case scenario would be none of that stuff exists,” he said of meme coins. He said he still hopes that $TRUMP coin and others like it could be an “on-ramp” to bitcoin.

More than 67,000 buyers of the Trump meme coin have acquired it with debit cards, a likely sign that they were crypto neophytes, according to an analysis by The Washington Post.

Bitcoin investor Ryan Nichols, who traveled to the Bitcoin 2025 conference from Austin, Texas, said he's a Trump fan but wouldn't touch Trump's digital currency.

“I love Trump. I really want to see what he does to improve this country. But at the same time, I don't think his coin is going to be much better than the Hawk Tuah coin,” he said, referring to a meme coin that crashed in December and is now the subject of lawsuits.

“I think it will continue to be a pretty good investment for a few more months at most, and then probably drop,” he said.

The Trump Organization and the website administrators of gettrumpmemes.com, where the meme token is for sale, did not respond to requests for comment Friday.

The White House declined to comment, saying in an email, “The $TRUMP meme coin has nothing to do with the White House!”

The price of the $TRUMP coin fluctuates. It sold for less than $1 a coin on Jan. 17, the night Trump announced it with a post on X. Within two days, it soared past $70, according to data from research site CoinGecko. Its value plunged after Trump's inauguration and has since bounced in a range from about $8 to $16 a coin. On Friday, it was trading at around $11, with a total market capitalization of $2.2 billion, according to CoinGecko.

First lady Melania Trump launched a meme coin of her own, called $MELANIA, also in January. Its price has cratered from more than $13 a coin to $0.32 as of Friday, according to CoinGecko.

Two Trump-affiliated companies own 80% of the $TRUMP coin project. While their ability to sell is restricted in the short term, the creators get a fee for every trade. Those fees have added up to more than $324 million since January, according to the research firm Chainalysis. The amount going to Trump personally is not known.

Another conference attendee, Edan Yago, a co-founder of the startup BitcoinOS, called the $TRUMP coin a form of legal corruption and not a good use of the underlying technology.

“Trump has discovered that he can issue a token and have people buy that token. Given our current legal system, it's all fine, and so there's new forms of graft and new forms of corruption that have come part and parcel with this new technology,” he said in an interview at the conference.

He compared meme coins to brothels on the edge of a gold rush. “You always have this happen whenever there's massive growth,” he said.

Audrey Geiger, another bitcoin investor, said she voted for Trump and likes that he has loosened regulations on cryptocurrency, but she said she wouldn't buy the $TRUMP coin.

“Never touched the stuff,” she said. “I just ignore that. It's all noise. It's gambling.”

The comments are a sign of a tension in the marriage between the MAGA and crypto movements. The two groups formed an alliance last year, when Trump was seeking support for his return to the White House and the crypto industry was looking for changes in federal policy.

Trump had previously been a harsh critic of cryptocurrency, saying in 2021 that it “seems like a scam,” but he flipped in the following years. He spoke at last year's bitcoin conference, made a series of promises to support crypto in office and now calls himself “the crypto president.”

Trump has made aggressive moves to deregulate the cryptocurrency industry and has vowed to launch a government-owned “strategic reserve” of digital currency. Fueled in part by those actions, bitcoin soared to a record high of more than $111,000 in May.

“As soon as he won the election, that set in stone that he was the face of crypto for at least the next four years,” Nichols said.

Trump's coin has been widely criticized, with government ethics experts and Democratic politicians decrying it as a breach of presidential norms and a vector for possible attempts at influence-buying. Some Republican lawmakers said Trump's dinner with $TRUMP coin owners made them uncomfortable.

Jason Jisa, who attended the Bitcoin 2025 conference as a vendor selling Trump-themed merchandise, said he owns bitcoin but not Trump's coin. Wearing a gold- and silver-colored sequin jacket, he said the meme coin has left him stumped.

“It's something we're all paying attention to, trying to figure it out, right? It's something new,” he said.

New Hampshire state Rep. Keith Ammon, a Republican, spoke onstage at the conference about his role in creating his state's pathbreaking cryptocurrency reserve. In an interview, he said Trump's coin shouldn't be part of such a reserve fund, which under New Hampshire law is limited to digital assets with a market capitalization of over $500 billion.

“A meme coin is like a casino chip: You might get lucky on it, but it's not a long-term store of value. It's a Skee-Ball token,” he said. By contrast, he said he believes bitcoin “is the digital version of the bar of gold.”

But even as many bitcoin enthusiasts expressed frustration with Trump's meme coin, none of the conference attendees interviewed by NBC News suggested there was anything to be done about it other than to try to persuade Trump to back off. They all said they oppose federal regulation of cryptocurrency, preferring to let meme coin buyers beware.

Seth for Privacy said the community needs to “take the good with the bad.”

“If you could limit what cryptocurrencies people could launch or what meme coins could exist, necessarily you could limit what freedom use cases could exist with these things as well,” he said.

At the three-day conference at the Venetian resort and casino, Trump's name, likeness and slogans were everywhere: on artwork for sale, on hats and clothing and on the lips of speakers. A Trump look-alike roamed the expo floor.

And onstage, speakers reinforced the mutual benefits of the MAGA-crypto marriage. They praised Trump's overhaul of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which previously classified many digital tokens as securities under a 1933 law. And they extolled Trump's pardon of Ross Ulbricht, who in 2015 was sentenced to life in prison for running the dark web marketplace Silk Road. Prosecutors had blamed Silk Road for six drug overdose deaths, while Trump called the sentence too harsh.

The White House dispatched a cadre of advisers to speak at the conference, an unusual show of force from the U.S. government at an event that's explicitly anti-government. Sacks, the White House czar for crypto and artificial intelligence, said onstage that the Trump administration had already delivered much of what the industry had on its wish list, and he solicited ideas from the audience about what more the administration could do for crypto.

“I think by August, we might have achieved the crypto agenda in Washington,” Sacks said onstage Tuesday. “What would you guys like to see? What else is on your wish list?""

Crypto booster Tyler Winklevoss, onstage with Sacks, said the U.S. government should acquire more bitcoin, prompting applause from the audience.

Don Jr. and Eric Trump predicted at the conference that bitcoin's price would keep rising to record highs. And Vance, who said he still owns bitcoin that he's held for years, urged conference attendees to get involved in politics including the 2026 midterm elections, or else face a potential crackdown by crypto skeptics.

“Don't ignore politics, because I guarantee you, my friends, politics is not going to ignore this community,” Vance said.

Panel moderators did not raise the subject of the $TRUMP meme coin onstage with Sacks, the Trump brothers or others from Trump world. The subject appeared not to come up at all in the conference's official programming, even though many attendees had closely followed news about the coin with concern.

Some bitcoin holders said that the depth of the Trump-crypto alliance made them a little uncomfortable. They noted that bitcoin was invented in 2008 to be independent of any government or other central authority.

“The people that are in politics are kind of the bandwagoners,” said Dustin Lee, a conference attendee who said he's been working in crypto for eight years and has his own meme coin, called Quai Boss. He said he was OK with the politicians' presence, though. “We need the stragglers to get into the space, to bring on the rest of the people,” he said.

Geiger said that although she likes Trump and his policies, she's still pessimistic in general about politicians and their intentions toward bitcoin.

“I don't want to be blindsided. I don't want to be like, ‘Oh, everything's all right now, because the orange guy won.' It's not that. Some of the things are moving slowly in a direction I love. But on the whole, politicians are gonna politician. They're gonna do their thing.”

The United States should stockpile guns, ammunition and drones instead of bitcoin, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Friday at the inaugural Reagan National Economic Forum in California. 

“We shouldn't be stockpiling bitcoins,” Dimon said when asked about how industrial policy is entwined with national security policies during a panel. 

“We should stockpiling guns, bullets, tanks, planes, drones, you know, rare earths. We know we need to do it. It's not a mystery.” 

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates outside of banking or government authority.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March establishing a Bitcoin reserve, which he described as “a virtual Fort Knox for digital gold.” 

“We should be stockpiling bullets,” he continued. 

“Like, you know, the military guys tell you that, you know, if there's a war in the South China Sea, we have missiles for seven days. Okay, come on. I mean, we can't say that with a straight face and think that's okay. So we know what to do. We just got to now go about doing it. Get the people together, roll up our sleeves, you know, have the debates.” 

Dimon joined a fireside chat during the Reagan National Economic Forum in Simi Valley, California, at the Reagan Presidential Library Friday for a sweeping discussion on the economy and how the world's “tectonic plates are shifting” in geopolitics in the form of wars, proxy terrorists and the potential proliferation of nuclear weapons. 

Dimon underscored during his address that he does not view China as America's top adversary, and instead pointed his attention to the “enemy within” that could lead to the U.S.' status as the world's leader crater. 

“I'm not as worried about China,” Dimon said. 

“China is a potential adversary. They're doing a lot of things well, they have a lot of problems. But what I really worry about is us. Can we get our own act together, our own values, our own capability, our own management?”

“I always get asked this question: Are we going to be the reserve currency?” he said. 

“No. You know, if we are not the preeminent military and the preeminent economy in 40 years, we will not be the reserve currency. That's a fact. Just read history.” 

He referred to the U.S. government as a “Leviathan” that is too weak to carry out policies, while simultaneously imposing “things on the American public that they're getting sick of.” 

Dimon argued that instead, the U.S. needs to celebrate its long-held values.

“Celebrate our virtues: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of enterprise, equal opportunity, family, God, country,” he said. 

“You know, and you can acknowledge the flaws that we have, which are extraordinary — what we did the Black population for years. Don't denigrate the great things of this country, because those are two different things.”

“We don't talk that much to each other — deal with our policies — this is the enemy within,” he continued.

“We've got to fix our permitting our regulations our immigration our taxation, which I, I think they're on their way. We have to fix our inner city schools, our health care system.” 

The Reagan National Economic forum kicked off Friday, and includes panels featuring Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, lawmakers such as Sens. Mike Rounds and Bill Cassidy, and leaders from the private sector, such as the CEO of Booz Allen Hamilton, Horacio Rozanski. 

The bipartisan event works to promote “President Reagan's enduring belief in the power of the free market and individual opportunity to drive national prosperity,” according to forum organizers.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says the U.S. should prepare for war, not a bitcoin-driven future.

Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California on Friday, TheStreet reports, Dimon dismissed recent government moves to bolster a national digital asset reserve, arguing that real-world defense logistics, not blockchain assets, should take priority.

“We shouldn't be stockpiling bitcoins,” Dimon said. “We know what we need. It's not a mystery.” He called for the prioritization of “guns, bullets, tanks, planes, drones, and rare earths.”

Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump called for the establishment of a bitcoin reserve and digital assets stockpile. Dimon isn't convinced about it.

“If there's a war in the South China Sea, we've got missiles for seven days,” he warned. “That's not something we should be saying with a straight face.”

Dimon, a well-known crypto critic, revealed earlier this month that JPMorgan will soon allow clients to buy bitcoin.

 Analysts say Ethereum's breakout versus Bitcoin could trigger a 250x altcoin market rally, signaling the start of a 2025 altseason. 

Key takeaways:

Ethereum is forming bullish cup-and-handle and bull flag patterns against Bitcoin, signaling a potential 30–55% upside.

Analysts say an ETH/BTC breakout could trigger a major altseason, similar to those in 2017 and 2021.

Historical altcoin market patterns suggest potential for a 250x rally in 2025 if trends repeat.

Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), is forming at least two classic bullish patterns versus Bitcoin (BTC), fueling optimism that a breakout could trigger the next altcoin season.

The Ether-to-Bitcoin ratio (ETH/BTC) is forming a cup-and-handle and a bull pennant pattern, each indicating massive gains.  

In the cup-and-handle scenario, ETH/BTC suggests a potential breakout above the 0.02596 BTC neckline, with a technical target near 0.03814 BTC, implying a 55% upside by July.

The 0.03814 BTC level aligns with the December 2024 resistance level.

The bull flag pattern, on the other hand, indicates a potential breakout toward 0.03235 BTC, about 30% above current levels, by July. The upside target aligns with the January-February 2025 levels.

Ethereum's breakout versus Bitcoin could initiate the altseason in 2025, according to analyst Trader Tardigrade.

The outlook takes cues from periods when Ether's outperformance versus Bitcoin has coincided with massive rallies in the altcoin market, namely the 2,500%-plus gains during the 2020-2021 crypto bull market.

Other analysts reinforce the altseason thesis, namely Sensei, who shows the altcoin market cap relative to Bitcoin retesting a long-term ascending support trendline.

Historically, each bounce from this level has preceded massive altcoin rallies—one leading to a 9,000% surge and another to a 180,000% explosion in market capitalization.

This chart anticipates a 250,000% rally in altcoins based on a repeating historical pattern of altseasons. Analyst Rinor also anticipates the same.

Analyst Moustache also notes that altcoins are breaking out of a seven-year falling wedge, a pattern that preceded major rallies in 2017 and 2020, signaling another altseason may be near.

Trading in the mid-$2,000 range, Ethereum (ETH) has repeatedly teased a move toward $3,000, only to fall short and retreat back into its current range. However, several crypto analysts remain confident that ETH's ascent to $3,000 and beyond is only a matter of time.

In a recent X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted ETH's bullish price action. The analyst shared the following daily ETH chart, showing the cryptocurrency breaking out of a bullish flag following a period of consolidation – potentially setting its sights on a target of $3,800.

Fellow crypto analyst Master of Crypto shared Titan's outlook, saying that ETH is “holding up really well right now.” In a separate X post, the analyst added:

It looks like a breakout is coming, and $3K is just around the corner. The fact that it's outperforming #BTC this quarter is a strong sign that altcoin season is warming up.

Meanwhile, crypto trader Jelle urged patience. Sharing the following chart of ETH's recent price movement, he emphasized that ETH is behaving as expected as it continues to challenge a key resistance level. According to Jelle, the “real fun” will begin once ETH hits $3,000.

Notably, ETH continues to attract strong institutional interest. Exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows for Ethereum topped $91 million yesterday, with BlackRock alone accounting for $50.4 million of that total – a clear sign of sustained confidence in the digital asset.

Seasoned analyst Ali Martinez also highlighted significant whale accumulation. According to Martinez, wallets holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 ETH acquired over 1 million ETH in the last 48 hours – a strong signal of long-term bullish sentiment.

Large ETH ETF inflows and whale purchases signal rising institutional confidence and aggressive accumulation – trends that often precede bullish price action. By reducing the available supply on the market, these moves can help fuel upward momentum and price appreciation.

From a technical standpoint, Ethereum is showing encouraging signs. Crypto trader Merlijn The Trader pointed out that ETH appears to be closely following the Wyckoff Accumulation pattern.

In this pattern, the spring phase involves a false breakdown below support to shake out weak hands, followed by a test to confirm waning selling pressure. This sets the stage for the jump – a strong rally above resistance with significant volume, marking the start of a new uptrend.

According to Merlijn, ETH has already completed the spring and test phases and is now poised to enter the jump phase – potentially setting the stage for a move toward a new all-time high (ATH).

That said, all eyes are on the FTX creditor payouts expected later today. Experts warn that the massive $5 billion distribution could temporarily dampen ETH's bullish momentum by increasing short-term selling pressure. At press time, ETH trades at $2,603, down 2.4% in the past 24 hours.

Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), has almost doubled in price since bottoming out in April at around $1,385. But while price action appears stable on the surface, onchain data from Binance suggests mounting downside pressure.

Several key metrics, as highlighted by CryptoQuant-based onchain analyst BorisVest, are flashing signs of distribution and potential capitulation risk. Let's examine.

One of the clearest warning signs is the sustained rise in Ethereum reserves on Binance.

Since December, ETH reserves have increased from around 3.78 million to over 4.21 million, marking a seven-month high. This trend typically signals growing sell-side interest, as large holders transfer coins to exchanges in preparation to liquidate.

When traders anticipate a bullish continuation, they tend to withdraw ETH to self-custody or stake. Conversely, surging exchange reserves imply a readiness to sell, particularly when price rallies coincide with inflows.

It shows that traders are opting to capitalize on local highs, suggesting they do not expect a breakout above the $2,700 resistance to hold.

The exchange netflow chart further confirms this bearish shift.

Over just three trading sessions, Binance has received a combined net inflow of more than 346,000 ETH. This occurred precisely as ETH attempted to rally toward the upper end of its current range.

Netflow measures the difference between ETH deposits and withdrawals from an exchange. Positive values reflect net deposits—typically associated with increased selling pressure—while negative values suggest accumulation.

These large daily inflows, paired with a lack of significant price follow-through, indicate that whales used the recent bounce as an exit. The lack of upward continuation reinforces that demand was insufficient to absorb the supply.

The Ethereum Exchange Supply Ratio—which tracks the share of ETH's total supply held on Binance—also rose during the recent rally. As of late May, the ratio climbed back toward 0.034, up from near-yearly lows in March.

This indicator adds another layer to the bearish picture. More supply moving onto exchanges means greater potential sell pressure in the near term. As this ratio increases while price consolidates or trends higher, it suggests that sellers are becoming more active than buyers.

The alignment of a rising supply ratio with increasing reserves and net inflows strongly implies a coordinated distribution phase. Bulls may interpret stability as strength, but the underlying metrics contradict that view.

Finally, the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio reveals a critical dynamic: while ETH saw aggressive market buying during its most recent bounce, it failed to generate momentum. The ratio jumped above 1.0 on several days in late May, signaling that buyers were initiating trades at market price.

Ordinarily, such taker activity is bullish—it reflects conviction and urgency from buyers. However, when a surge in market buys fails to push the price higher, it suggests that sellers are using the demand as exit liquidity.

In essence, the rally created the illusion of strength, while whales and institutional traders sold into it. This absorption of buying power without upside follow-through typically precedes a breakdown, especially when confirmed by rising exchange reserves and netflows.

Ethereum has formed a clear inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart, pointing to a potential breakout toward $4,150 if the neckline at $2,700 is breached. The structure, coupled with a recent golden cross, suggests bullish momentum could build—if confirmed.

ETH continues to face rejection near the neckline, and volume remains weak. The relative strength index (RSI) is correcting after breaching the overbought threshold of 70. At 56, it shows room for further downside.

A decisive close above $2,700 is needed to validate the breakout. Failure to do so risks a drop toward $2,300 or lower, invalidating the bullish setup.

Ethereum is testing a critical resistance confluence near $2,530, formed by a flipped multi-year ascending trendline, the upper boundary of a descending wedge, and the 0.382 Fib level. So far, ETH has failed to break above this zone.

Adding pressure is the 50-week EMA near $2,575, which ETH has not decisively closed above. This keeps the broader trend bearish.

A rejection from this confluence could trigger a drop to the wedge's lower boundary near $1,975, with extended downside toward the 0.0 Fib level at $1,075. The risk of breakdown remains high unless ETH reclaims $2,575 with strong volume.

Crypto World News

May 31, 2025 by Sajjal Ali 

Ethereum (ETH), the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently trading at $2,527.51, reflecting a 3.25% decline in the last 24 hours. The asset's 24-hour trading volume has slipped to $23.47 billion, marking a 1.81% decrease, while the seven-day trend also shows a mild drop of 1.11%, pointing to a cautious market atmosphere.

Technical analysis provided by Alpha Crypto Signal indicates that ETH has been tracing an ascending channel, characterized by higher highs and higher lows. However, recent price action shows Ethereum breaking below its 50 EMA and 100 SMA, suggesting a shift toward short-term bearish momentum.

At present, ETH trades just below the channel's midline, with critical support between $2,400 and $2,450. A successful bounce from this level would maintain the structure and target the upper trendline between $2,700 and $2,800. However, a decisive close beneath the support zone could invalidate the pattern, potentially leading to a slide toward $2,300 or even $2,100.

Market projections for Ethereum in 2025 vary widely. DigitalCoinPrice offers a bullish outlook, suggesting that ETH may surpass $4,891.70 and potentially hit $5,508.79 by year-end. Their analysts cite historical trends and anticipated investor behavior to support this view, projecting Ethereum to reclaim and exceed its all-time high levels.

In contrast, Changelly's forecast is significantly more conservative, predicting ETH to average around $3,137.54 in 2025, with an upper ceiling of $2,556.28, implying a potential negative return on investment of -34.9%. For May 2025, their projection sets ETH's value flatly at $2,601.71, mirroring current levels and hinting at stagnation unless market dynamics shift considerably.

These conflicting predictions underscore the volatility and speculative nature of crypto markets, where sentiment and external factors can dramatically reshape price trajectories.

One of the most notable developments influencing Ethereum's longer-term trajectory is a recent SEC clarification on protocol staking. In a rare moment of regulatory clarity, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Corporation Finance affirmed that Protocol Staking Activities do not require registration under the Securities Act. This applies to self-staking, delegated, custodial, and non-custodial forms, removing significant legal uncertainty.

The decision will apparently stimulate more institutions to stake on Ethereum. ETF issuers, custodial banks, and other financial players now have in their hands fewer obstacles to entering the world of Ethereum staking. This regulatory change is similar to previous changes, such as the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which attracted significant capital inflows.

Ethereum might witness a comparable surge in Total Value Locked (TVL) and staking activity, thereby making its structural outlook even yet price volatility is there to complicate matters.

Bitcoin's recent upward trajectory has encountered resistance after reaching a record-breaking peak of over $111,000 last week. Following this new all-time high, Bitcoin has retraced approximately 4% in the past seven days, bringing its current trading price down to $105,485.

This represents a daily decline of 1.8%, reflecting cautious market sentiment and potential profit-taking among traders. In light of these recent price movements, a CryptoQuant analyst has been closely observing market dynamics, particularly concerning the launch of the Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).

A detailed analysis provided by Joao Wedson, a contributor to CryptoQuant's QuickTake platform, has shed new light on the liquidation trends observed in Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies, also known as altcoins.

Liquidation Disparity Between Bitcoin and Altcoins

Since the launch of the Bitcoin ETF, market behaviors have demonstrated a notable divergence between Bitcoin and altcoin liquidations. According to Wedson, Bitcoin liquidations on Binance have predominantly involved short positions, indicating traders who bet against Bitcoin were systematically liquidated during its recent price rise.

Specifically, the Cumulative Liquidation Delta (CLD) showed short liquidations surpassing longs by approximately $190 million. This suggests market participants holding bearish positions were compelled to exit as Bitcoin's value surged, pushing the price further upward.

In stark contrast, altcoins have experienced a markedly different scenario. During the same period, altcoins faced nearly $1 billion more in long liquidations compared to shorts.

This liquidation imbalance indicates that traders betting on a broad altcoin recovery faced substantial losses. The sustained downward pressure on altcoins reveals the failure of expectations surrounding an “Altseason,” a period when alternative cryptocurrencies typically outperform BTC.

Implications of Market Asymmetry

The distinct patterns in liquidations between BTC and altcoins reflect critical shifts in investor risk sentiment and leverage usage. BTC's favorable price performance primarily impacted traders with bearish outlooks, forcing the liquidation of short positions and contributing to a bullish market perception.

Conversely, the altcoin sector's persistent price declines have led to widespread liquidation of bullish positions, highlighting the misalignment between trader expectations and actual market behavior.

According to Wedson, since December 2024, this liquidation asymmetry has widened considerably, underscoring a shift in market focus. Investors have increasingly viewed BTC as a safer or more reliable bet amidst broader market uncertainty, while altcoins have suffered due to heightened leverage and speculative positioning.

This trend has intensified following the ETF's approval, as traders appear more confident betting on Bitcoin's stability and growth potential compared to the volatility and unpredictability of the altcoin market.

Moving forward, the current market conditions suggest that investors may continue to approach Bitcoin with measured optimism while maintaining a cautious stance toward altcoins.

In an interview with Korean crypto researcher Juhyuk Bak, also known as @JuhyukB, Capriole Investments CEO Charles Edwards laid out a striking divergence in the crypto asset markets: while Bitcoin could double this year, altcoins remain structurally impaired and far from any meaningful rotation.

Bitcoin Could Hit $200,000 This Year

Speaking from the perspective of a macro quant hedge fund operator, Edwards was unequivocally bullish on Bitcoin, stating, “If the data stays in the current trend we're in, I think $150–200K is definitely possible this year.” The founder of Capriole, a fund known for pioneering on-chain valuation models like Hash Ribbons, Energy Value, and the Macro Index, grounded this forecast in a web of interlocking technical, sentiment, and macroeconomic signals.

“We're printing new all-time highs on daily and weekly closes,” Edwards noted. “As long as we stay above $104K […] as long as the Macro Index trends up, and US liquidity continues to rise, this environment is very bullish.”

Capriole's proprietary Macro Index—a machine learning model aggregating over 100 inputs from Fed liquidity to bond and equity markets—has turned decisively positive. Bitcoin's rally, Edwards emphasized, is further reinforced by metrics like MVRV Z-Score, Hodler Growth Rates, and Energy Value, all signaling room for expansion.

But while Bitcoin shows strength across multiple dimensions, altcoins are telling a very different story.

The Death Of The Old Altcoin Cycle

Edwards refrained from naming specific altcoins but delivered a clear macro verdict: the capital flow dynamics have changed, and altcoins are no longer on an equal footing with Bitcoin. “Structurally, things are quite a bit different this cycle […] the biggest driving forces are Bitcoin ETFs and US policy. That's creating a centralizing effect—funneling capital directly into Bitcoin,” he explained.

He pointed to the historical cycles of retail-led altcoin rallies, followed by catastrophic drawdowns—often exceeding 99% losses. “Retail has just gotten destroyed,” he said bluntly. “There's a fatigue in the altcoin space that wasn't there four or five years ago.”

The legacy of failed ICOs, broken tokenomics, and events like the FTX collapse have left lasting scars. Meanwhile, institutions are avoiding the risks and complexity of smaller-cap digital assets, opting instead for regulated Bitcoin exposure through ETFs and corporate treasury allocations. “It used to be more of a level playing field. That's no longer the case,” Edwards said. “The real money is flowing into Bitcoin—and that probably continues for a while.” When Will Altcoins Wake Up? 

Despite the grim tone, Edwards does not dismiss altcoins entirely. He views a strong altcoin cycle as conditional—not impossible, but dependent on clear Bitcoin dominance first.

Using Capriole's Speculation Index and Crypto Breadth models, which track the relative strength and price movement of altcoins, he made a key observation: “Right now, only 5% of altcoins are above their 200-day moving average. That's not bullish.”

He compared the current setup to late 2020, when Bitcoin surged from $10K to $60K before altcoins began outperforming. That rotation required Bitcoin to first breach previous all-time highs decisively. “You want Bitcoin to hit something like $140K while alts are still underperforming. That would be the ideal setup […] that's when capital begins rotating downstream,” he explained.

Conversely, if altcoins begin pumping prematurely, while Bitcoin remains range bound, Edwards sees that as a top signal. “That's usually the last puff of air,” he warned. Cycles Are Changing, Risks Are Evolving 

Beyond price action, Edwards questioned the relevance of traditional halving cycles. He argued that the impact of miners—once the primary driver of Bitcoin supply dynamics—has diminished significantly due to ETFs, corporate treasuries, and sovereign actors like Michael Saylor. “That four-year cycle is dead—or at least dramatically weaker. Miners are now just 2–3% of the total supply flow. The real drivers today are institutions,” he said.

This evolution reduces the probability of 80% drawdowns and increases the risk of systemic leverage—particularly from publicly traded Bitcoin-heavy firms. While not an immediate concern, Edwards sees potential for long-term vulnerabilities if major players overextend.

Edwards also discussed diversification within Capriole's portfolio. While Bitcoin remains the firm's core allocation, he revealed exposure to quantum computing equities like IonQ (IONQ), Rigetti (RGTI), D-Wave (QBTS), and QUBT. “I think quantum is like Bitcoin in 2015. It's early, it's volatile, but the long-term CAGR could be even higher than Bitcoin's.”

He added that gold also plays a strategic role, not as a replacement but as a hedge. Capriole monitors the gold-to-equity ratio closely, and its breakout above the 200-day moving average is seen as a historically bullish signal—both for gold and Bitcoin.

In closing, Edwards urged investors to tune out most of the financial news cycle. “Probably 99% of headlines don't matter,” he said. Instead, focus on game-changing shifts: Fed pivots, global liquidity expansions, and true structural reconfigurations of capital flow. “We're wired to overreact to bad news. The key is to filter it down to a few macro drivers that actually move the market—and Bitcoin right now has those working in its favor.”

Until altcoins show meaningful breadth and break their long-term resistance structures, Edwards' message is clear: Bitcoin will soar. Altcoins won't—at least, not yet.

At press time, BTC traded at $105,557.

 Analysts say Ethereum's breakout versus Bitcoin could trigger a 250x altcoin market rally, signaling the start of a 2025 altseason. 

Key takeaways:

Ethereum is forming bullish cup-and-handle and bull flag patterns against Bitcoin, signaling a potential 30–55% upside.

Analysts say an ETH/BTC breakout could trigger a major altseason, similar to those in 2017 and 2021.

Historical altcoin market patterns suggest potential for a 250x rally in 2025 if trends repeat.

Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), is forming at least two classic bullish patterns versus Bitcoin (BTC), fueling optimism that a breakout could trigger the next altcoin season.

The Ether-to-Bitcoin ratio (ETH/BTC) is forming a cup-and-handle and a bull pennant pattern, each indicating massive gains.  

In the cup-and-handle scenario, ETH/BTC suggests a potential breakout above the 0.02596 BTC neckline, with a technical target near 0.03814 BTC, implying a 55% upside by July.

The 0.03814 BTC level aligns with the December 2024 resistance level.

The bull flag pattern, on the other hand, indicates a potential breakout toward 0.03235 BTC, about 30% above current levels, by July. The upside target aligns with the January-February 2025 levels.

Ethereum's breakout versus Bitcoin could initiate the altseason in 2025, according to analyst Trader Tardigrade.

The outlook takes cues from periods when Ether's outperformance versus Bitcoin has coincided with massive rallies in the altcoin market, namely the 2,500%-plus gains during the 2020-2021 crypto bull market.

Related: Ethereum flashes ‘altseason' signal as ETH price eyes $4.1K

Other analysts reinforce the altseason thesis, namely Sensei, who shows the altcoin market cap relative to Bitcoin retesting a long-term ascending support trendline.

Historically, each bounce from this level has preceded massive altcoin rallies—one leading to a 9,000% surge and another to a 180,000% explosion in market capitalization.

This chart anticipates a 250,000% rally in altcoins based on a repeating historical pattern of altseasons. Analyst Rinor also anticipates the same.

Analyst Moustache also notes that altcoins are breaking out of a seven-year falling wedge, a pattern that preceded major rallies in 2017 and 2020, signaling another altseason may be near.

Key Takeaways

Yuga Labs, the cryptocurrency company most famously known for its Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, has sold the Moonbirds NFT intellectual property to Orange Cap Games in a deal that mirrors the company's strategic priorities in evolution. 

The sale, whose financial terms have not been made public, is Yuga's third IP transaction of 2022. Earlier this year, Yuga sold the intellectual property rights for Meebits and CryptoPunks, which represents a significant shift away from diversifying within NFTs.

Originally acquired by Yuga Labs in early 2024 as part of a broader purchase of creator Proof, the Moonbirds IP was once a flagship project within the Ethereum NFT space. 

However, with Yuga now doubling down on its core initiatives, most notably the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem and its metaverse project, the decision to divest seems in tune with a more focused long-term vision.

Orange Cap Games is a new player in the blockchain gaming market, but recently took over the Moonbirds brand. The studio, known for its hybrid approach to physical and digital experiences, just launched its trading card game based on Pudgy Penguins on the Ethereum layer-2 network. 

The acquisition of Moonbirds is a sign of increasing ambition to expand its IP portfolio as well as its presence in the NFT-powered gaming space.

While Orange Cap hasn't explicitly said what it will do with Moonbirds, the brand assets it may create in the future could run on Ethereum's mainnet or ApeChain, Yuga's affiliated layer-2 network. The Moonbirds assets will still be featured in Yuga's Otherside metaverse, so there will be some consistency between the two firms.

Moonbirds, which launched in April 2022 at the height of NFT fever, saw remarkable early sales with over $280 million in transactions in its first weekend. Although Proof had sparked significant early interest and raised a lot of money, the subsequent decline of the NFT market hit its creator hard. 

Community engagement dropped, and momentum fizzled. The 2024 acquisition by Yuga was considered a breath of fresh air for the project, but it has recently passed into new hands again.The Moonbirds sale caps off a big trend of 2025: acquisition or realignment around core assets by the major players. As Yuga Labs shifts its focus back to its core projects, other companies like Orange Cap Games are taking on the challenge of breathing new life into classic NFT brands. 

The brand's resurgence depends on Moonbirds' ability to captivate the audience again, and that will depend on the creative and technical prowess of Orange Cap in this swiftly changing digital world.

As meme coins gain momentum, launchpads have become key tools for early access to new tokens. Best Wallet stands out in 2025 as a top launchpad, praised for its strong features and user-friendly design.

It offers early investors reduced fees, staking rewards, and participation in community governance. 

With the upcoming Best Card—allowing direct crypto spending and cashback—Best Wallet combines utility with growth potential, making it a strong choice for forward-looking investors.

Summary

Historical trends in the crypto market show the strong potential of early investment in utility tokens linked to widely used platforms.

A well-known example is the Trust Wallet Token (TWT), which launched at around $0.006 and later peaked at $2.61. Even after a correction to $0.74, early buyers who entered at $0.10 still saw returns of over 8x.

These examples highlight the value of utility tokens tied to wallets that offer real functionality and attract a large user base. Investors are now turning their attention to Best Wallet, a new platform that may follow a similar path.

Best Wallet is a fully operational cryptocurrency wallet available on both Google Play and the Apple App Store. It has already attracted hundreds of thousands of users and maintains strong user satisfaction, with a 4.3-star rating on Google and 4.4 on Apple.

Its clean interface and useful features make it appealing to both beginners and experienced crypto users.

A key feature that sets Best Wallet apart is its built-in token launchpad, which enables users to take part in early-stage ICOs of new meme coins and crypto projects directly through the app.

This combination of wallet functionality and access to new projects offers a unique advantage in the crowded crypto wallet market.

With steady user growth, strong engagement, and a practical utility token model, Best Wallet is emerging as a standout project for investors seeking opportunities similar to TWT's success.

Best Wallet's native token is currently in its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) stage, priced at approximately $0.025105. It has already raised close to $13 million in funding. As the ICO progresses, the token price has steadily increased, reflecting growing investor confidence and interest in the project.

Investors can participate in the ICO using various payment methods, including cryptocurrencies and credit card payments, all accessible directly through the Best Wallet app.

Early participation in the Best Wallet ICO offers several benefits. Token holders enjoy reduced transaction fees within the Best Wallet ecosystem, higher staking rewards, and the ability to engage in platform governance, helping shape future development.

Additionally, early investors gain priority access to new crypto projects launched on the Best Wallet platform, enhancing the token's overall value.

Beyond its core wallet features, Best Wallet has rapidly established itself as a top cryptocurrency launchpad, especially for meme coins in 2025.

It frequently appears in crypto community discussions and search queries as a leading launchpad platform. Best Wallet consistently outperforms major competitors such as Launchpad XYZ, yPredict, Dash2Trade, Binance Launchpad, OKX Jumpstart, and Gate.io Startup.

This success stems from Best Wallet's carefully curated selection of ICOs, featuring some of the most highly marketed and sought-after projects in the crypto space.

Its intuitive and user-friendly interface simplifies the investment process, allowing a wider audience to participate without dealing with complex procedures.

Best Wallet has introduced a clear and ambitious roadmap to improve its platform. The project is currently in phase two, which includes:

Looking ahead to phases three and four, the platform will introduce additional features, including the Best Card — a crypto debit card that offers up to 8% cashback on purchases.

Users who stake Best Wallet tokens will also benefit from reduced fees on card transactions, adding further value to long-term participation.

This focus on real-world utility addresses a key challenge in the crypto industry: usability. Many people still find it difficult to use cryptocurrency in everyday situations. Best Wallet aims to close this gap by combining practical tools with investment opportunities.

With a feature-rich wallet, an integrated launchpad for new projects, staking incentives, and the upcoming debit card, Best Wallet is creating a complete and user-friendly ecosystem.

This positions the platform as a strong choice for those looking for both growth potential and day-to-day crypto utility. Visit Best Wallet.

The United States should stockpile guns, ammunition and drones instead of bitcoin, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Friday at the inaugural Reagan National Economic Forum in California. 

“We shouldn't be stockpiling bitcoins,” Dimon said when asked about how industrial policy is entwined with national security policies during a panel.

“We should stockpiling guns, bullets, tanks, planes, drones, you know, rare earths. We know we need to do it. It's not a mystery.” 

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates outside of banking or government authority.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March establishing a Bitcoin reserve, which he described as “a virtual Fort Knox for digital gold.” 

“We should be stockpiling bullets,” he continued.

“Like, you know, the military guys tell you that, you know, if there's a war in the South China Sea, we have missiles for seven days. Okay, come on. I mean, we can't say that with a straight face and think that's okay. So we know what to do. We just got to now go about doing it. Get the people together, roll up our sleeves, you know, have the debates.” 

Dimon joined a fireside chat during the Reagan National Economic Forum in Simi Valley, California, at the Reagan Presidential Library Friday for a sweeping discussion on the economy and how the world's “tectonic plates are shifting” in geopolitics in the form of wars, proxy terrorists and the potential proliferation of nuclear weapons.

Dimon underscored during his address that he does not view China as America's top adversary, and instead pointed his attention to the “enemy within” that could lead to the U.S.' status as the world's leader crater. 

“I'm not as worried about China,” Dimon said. 

“China is a potential adversary. They're doing a lot of things well, they have a lot of problems. But what I really worry about is us. Can we get our own act together, our own values, our own capability, our own management?”

“I always get asked this question: Are we going to be the reserve currency?” he said. 

“No. You know, if we are not the preeminent military and the preeminent economy in 40 years, we will not be the reserve currency. That's a fact. Just read history.” 

He referred to the U.S. government as a “Leviathan” that is too weak to carry out policies, while simultaneously imposing “things on the American public that they're getting sick of.” 

Dimon argued that instead, the U.S. needs to celebrate its long-held values.

“Celebrate our virtues: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of enterprise, equal opportunity, family, God, country,” he said. 

“You know, and you can acknowledge the flaws that we have, which are extraordinary — what we did the Black population for years. Don't denigrate the great things of this country, because those are two different things.”

“We don't talk that much to each other — deal with our policies — this is the enemy within,” he continued.

“We've got to fix our permitting our regulations our immigration our taxation, which I, I think they're on their way. We have to fix our inner city schools, our health care system.” 

The Reagan National Economic forum kicked off Friday, and includes panels featuring Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, lawmakers such as Sens. Mike Rounds and Bill Cassidy, and leaders from the private sector, such as the CEO of Booz Allen Hamilton, Horacio Rozanski. 

The bipartisan event works to promote “President Reagan's enduring belief in the power of the free market and individual opportunity to drive national prosperity,” according to forum organizers. ","{'href': 'https://nypost.com', 'title': 'New York Post'}","cryptocurrency"

By Liam Turner

Key Takeaways:

Cetus Protocol, an important decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Sui blockchain, suffered a serious security problem. Attackers managed to take over $220 million in different types of digital money. This event worried many users and the wider digital currency community. The hackers found a weakness in the platform's smart contracts, which are like digital agreements that control how trading pools work. They tricked the system into letting them take out large amounts of money after putting in only a little. The stolen funds included SUI tokens, stablecoins like USDC, and other tokens, some of which lost value quickly as they were drained.

Despite how bad the attack was, there was some good news. People who help run the Sui network, called validators, acted fast. They managed to freeze about $162 million of the stolen digital money soon after the hack was discovered. This quick response was very important because it stopped those funds from being lost forever.



After the funds were frozen, the Sui community had to decide what to do next. A proposal was made to move the recovered money to a safe place. On May 29, 2025, the community voted strongly in favor of this plan, with 90.9% agreeing. This showed that many people wanted to help fix the problem and support those who lost money.

A key part of the recovery is a new multi-signature (multisig) trust wallet. The $162 million in frozen funds were moved here. “Multi-signature” means that several people or groups need to agree before any money can be moved from this wallet. In this case, Cetus Protocol, the Sui Foundation (which supports the Sui blockchain), and OtterSec (a company that checks blockchain security) all have keys. This setup makes sure the money is handled safely and openly. The transfer to this secure wallet was completed around May 31, 2025.

Cetus Protocol has shared its plan to fully recover and pay back users. It's not just relying on the frozen funds. The platform will also use its own money from its treasury. Additionally, the Sui Foundation has agreed to give Cetus an emergency loan. This financial help is a big step towards making sure all users get their lost funds back, even if their specific assets weren't part of the $162 million that was frozen.

The path to full recovery for Cetus involves several important steps. First, Sui network validators will help make sure the recovered funds can be distributed from the multisig wallet according to Cetus's plan. At the same time, Cetus is working to fix the weak spots in its smart contracts and make the whole platform more secure. They are also working to bring back liquidity (enough funds for trading) and get all their services running again. Cetus hopes to do all of this and restart its platform about one week after the community vote. They are also creating a special system to handle compensation for users, which will be checked for safety before it's used.

Throughout this difficult time, Cetus Protocol has tried to keep its users informed about how the recovery is going. The team said sorry for the incident and its effects. They also asked the Sui community to work together to rebuild trust. A community meeting is planned to share more details about the hack and the recovery efforts. The teamwork between Cetus, the Sui Foundation, Sui validators, and security experts like OtterSec shows a strong effort to deal with such crises in the world of digital money.

TALLINN, Estonia, May  31, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As Phase 5 of its limited presale nears completion, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is gaining momentum for all the right reasons. With its innovative Nova App poised for launch and over $1.2 million raised from 11,000+ participants, the project signals a shift away from short-term hype and toward sustainable, long-term value creation.Bitcoin Solaris: Mining Reimagined for Real People

In a world where mining has become elite, expensive, and inaccessible to most, Bitcoin Solaris is changing everything.

At the core is the Solaris Nova App—a revolutionary, mobile-first platform designed to make crypto mining available to everyone, regardless of budget, location, or experience.

Don't Miss This Early BTC-S Opportunity

With this app, users can:

 

There's no complex setup. No bulky rigs. No tech barriers.

Bitcoin Solaris uses a hybrid Proof-of-Work + Delegated Proof-of-Stake model that processes up to 10,000 transactions per second, with finality in 2 seconds, and uses 99.95% less energy than traditional mining chains.

This isn't just mining made easier. This is mining made for the modern world—and it's the foundation for true, lasting crypto growth.

Final Hours of Phase 5: A Critical Entry Point

The presale, which ends on July 31, 2025, is entering a key transition. With less than 30 hours before Phase 5 ends, token pricing will move from $5 to $6, continuing toward a public launch price of $20. Investors in this window also receive an 11% token bonus, maximizing early participation benefits before broader exposure.

Key Presale Details:

Unlike speculative offerings, Bitcoin Solaris ties its presale directly to the rollout of functional technology. The Nova App—currently in limited beta—is nearing full release, making early access a strategic opportunity rather than a speculative gamble.Why Influencers Are Lining Up to Support It

 

Bitcoin Solaris hasn't just caught the eyes of early users—it's earning praise from trusted voices in the crypto space. Here's what they're saying:

Crypto News Philippines

“There is a critical need to align innovation with regulation in the country's evolving crypto landscape. “

This was what Atty. Paolo Ong, the assistant director of the PhiliFintech Innovation Office at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Philippines, stressed during his keynote at Crypto Vision Conference 2025 (CVCPH2025).

Ong's central message in his address is about how legal clarity and compliance can foster innovation and long-term growth in the digital asset industry. 

He then shared the timeline of the soon-to-be-implemented Crypto Assets Service Providers in the Philippines (CASP), a regulatory framework for entities offering crypto-related services by the regulator. 

According to the CVCPH2025 organizers, Ong presented how compliance and innovation can work together for long-term growth.

The CVCPH2025 is a yearly event by growth marketing campaign service provider and blockchain-focused transformative learning platform Museigen.io.

Museigen.io co-founder Fermin Barrenechea III opened the conference with a keynote presentation, encouraging attendees to evolve with technology rather than be left behind. 

He also introduced new concepts such as “Sleep-to-Earn,” “Learn-to-Earn,” and “Retail Therapy” as emerging trends in the post-Play-to-Earn era. 

Apart from these talks, the event also featured panel discussions, other keynotes, live demos, and over ₱1 million in prizes.

In a statement, Museigen.io shared that hundreds of blockchain professionals, investors, developers, and enthusiasts gathered at the AIM Conference Center for the event, a full-day event aiming to spotlight the growing web3 and crypto ecosystem in the Philippines.

Attendees also participated in games, booth passport activities, and received giveaways, including color-coded wristbands for streamlined networking and welcome leis for speakers. 

There are also sponsor booths from GCash, Coins.ph, BitMEX, and others providing demos, freebies, and interactive experiences throughout the venue.

Coins.ph Business Development Director Ralph Idio delivered a keynote on how stablecoins are reshaping remittances. He shared how stablecoins make remittances faster and more cost-efficient.

GCash's Head of Crypto Luis Buenaventura shared how he financed a Tesla using $BTC as collateral. He  highlighted the utility of crypto-backed lending.

CryptoBilis' Frank Andes and Al Yap provided essential wallet protection strategies and real-world cybersecurity lessons for digital asset holders.

Moderated by OpenGuild's Patricia Arro, the first panel featured Jen Bilango (Coins.ph), Robert Joseph Dela Cruz (UnionBank), and Mench Dizon (YGG Pilipinas), who discussed how DeFi and traditional finance can collaborate to create more inclusive financial systems.

Gail Macapagal (Women in Blockchain Philippines) led a session on artificial intelligence with BayaniChain's Paul Soliman, DvCode's Eliezer Rabadon, and Block Tides' Myrtle Ramos, exploring both the benefits and challenges AI brings to the tech and blockchain landscape.

MJ Aguilar moderated the closing panel featuring KC Montero (Kumu), Aldrin Rabino (Crypto4chun), James Genove (The Resistance Trader), and Miguel Avila (Impact Web3), who explored the intersection of gaming, personal values, and web3 technology.

Last year, Crypto Vision Conference 2024 was held on January 27 in Makati Citiy, which brought together crypto enthusiasts, industry leaders, and professionals for an evening of expert insights and networking focused on the evolving cryptocurrency market. 

Attendees gained a clearer outlook on the 2024 crypto landscape through in-depth discussions, while also enjoying raffle prizes, giveaways, and valuable networking opportunities, according to Museigen. 

In addition to Crypto Vision Conference, Museigen.io also conducts in-real-life gatherings for Bitbulaga. It is a webcast session designed for Filipinos interested in blockchain, cryptocurrency, and web3, featuring discussions with industry experts like Luis Buenaventura, Gilbert Lazaro, and Aldrin Rabino. Bitbulaga covers topics such as crypto trading, decentralized finance, and emerging tech trends.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","XRP Down 4% as Global Economic Tensions Trigger Market Selloff","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/31/xrp-down-4-as-global-economic-tensions-trigger-market-selloff","Sat, 31 May 2025 09:50:46 GMT","

XRP fell as much as 6% over the past 24 hours as global economic tensions rattled financial markets, triggering a wave of liquidations and pushing prices below key support levels. 

The token dropped from $2.20 to $2.14 as the broader crypto market shed 3.81% of its value, settling at a total market cap of $3.3 trillion.

The volatility comes in the wake of the U.S. Court of International Trade's decision to overturn Trump's trade tariffs, reigniting trade policy concerns and sending ripples across risk assets. 

XRP wasn't immune, with over $29.68 million in long positions liquidated as traders scrambled to adjust their exposure.

XRP found strong selling pressure at the $2.21 resistance level, failing to mount a sustained recovery, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. A notable support zone emerged near $2.11, with high-volume buying during the 03:00 hour preventing further downside. 

Recent consolidation between $2.13 and $2.14 suggests potential stabilization, though the pattern of lower highs indicates sellers remain in control.

In the final trading hour, XRP formed a higher-low pattern around $2.135, signaling potential short-term support. 

However, the token also faced resistance at $2.144-$2.145, forming a tight range that traders will be watching closely for the next breakout or breakdown.

Bitcoin prices fell below $104,000, leading to over $600 million in liquidations, marking the highest losses since February.

U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff increase on Chinese steel and aluminum has rattled global trade markets, affecting crypto markets.

The broader crypto market experienced a sell-off, with major cryptocurrencies like Ether, XRP, and Solana dropping significantly.

Crypto markets saw a wave of liquidations in the past 24 hours as bitcoin (BTC) prices slipped under $104,000, triggering over $600 million in forced closures of bullish futures positions to mark the highest losses since February.



A total of $688 million in liquidations hit traders, with 89% of them on the long side — reflecting a heavily bullish market. The largest single liquidation order was a $12.25 million BTC/USDT on OKX, Coinglass data shows.Bitcoin-tracked futures led losses at over $153 mmillion, followed by Ethereum (ETH) at around $122 million. Solana (SOL) faced liquidations totaling about $33 million, XRP futures at $30 million, and Dogecoin (DOGE) futures at over $22 million.



""Markets went red on Friday on renewed tariff-related apprehensions,"" said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, in an email to CoinDesk.



U.S. President Donald Trump accused China of violating a bilateral trade deal, prompting him to double tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50% to protect domestic industries. He claimed China reneged on a May agreement to ease trade tensions, adding that he might discuss the matter with President Xi.



While China is a top steel exporter, most of its steel is already subject to existing tariffs, per Reuters. Trump's move rattled global trade markets, with potential implications for key minerals and overall relations between the two nations.



The broader crypto market was also swept by the sell-off, with Ether down nearly 4%, XRP and Solana falling around 4-5%, and Dogecoin diving over 8% on the day.



Data from Deribit shows open interest in Bitcoin futures has surged 51% since April, with options up 126%, signaling increasing investor appetite for leverage. But whales — large holders with more than 10,000 BTC — have shifted from accumulation to net selling, sending coins back to exchanges in a classic sign of profit-taking.



A cascade of liquidations often indicates market extremes, where a price reversal could be imminent as market sentiment overshoots in one direction. Still, the renewed tariff flare-up, combined with a jittery derivatives market, has traders bracing for more volatility ahead.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says the U.S. should prepare for war, not a bitcoin-driven future.

Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California on Friday, TheStreet reports, Dimon dismissed recent government moves to bolster a national digital asset reserve, arguing that real-world defense logistics, not blockchain assets, should take priority.

“We shouldn't be stockpiling bitcoins,” Dimon said. “We know what we need. It's not a mystery.” He called for the prioritization of “guns, bullets, tanks, planes, drones, and rare earths.”

Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump called for the establishment of a bitcoin reserve and digital assets stockpile. Dimon isn't convinced about it.

“If there's a war in the South China Sea, we've got missiles for seven days,” he warned. “That's not something we should be saying with a straight face.”

Dimon, a well-known crypto critic, revealed earlier this month that JPMorgan will soon allow clients to buy bitcoin.

 IMF questions Pakistan's plan to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining amid energy shortages and budget talks. 

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised concerns over Pakistan's decision to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence data centers amid ongoing negotiations tied to the country's extended financial program.

The initiative, announced last week, is designed to attract autonomous miners, blockchain companies, and AI firms to Pakistan.

However, the IMF has raised red flags about the move, requesting urgent clarification from the Finance Ministry regarding the legality of crypto mining and the power allocations, particularly as the nation struggles with chronic energy shortages and fiscal pressures, according to a report by local news outlets Samaa.

Per the report, the IMF was not consulted prior to the announcement and is questioning the legal standing of cryptocurrencies in Pakistan. The Fund has also voiced concerns over potential impacts on power tariffs and resource distribution.

“There is a fear of further tough talks from the IMF on this initiative,” an official involved in the ongoing negotiations reportedly said. “The economic team is already facing stiff questions, and this move has only added to the complexities of the talks.”

Related: Pakistan announces Bitcoin strategic reserve

The IMF delegation, currently conducting virtual discussions with Pakistani officials, is expected to schedule a separate session dedicated to the government's electricity plan for Bitcoin (BTC) mining and AI operations.

The electricity allocation is part of a wider national strategy to integrate digital assets into Pakistan's economy. A key component of this plan is the establishment of the Pakistan Digital Asset Authority (PDAA), approved by the Finance Ministry on May 21.

The PDAA will regulate exchanges, wallets, stablecoins, and DeFi platforms while overseeing the tokenization of national assets in line with international frameworks such as those of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

The development follows Pakistan's high-profile debut of its first strategic Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin Vegas 2025 conference last week — an event signaling Islamabad's pivot toward digital finance.

During the conference, Bilal bin Saqib, crypto adviser to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, announced the launch of a national Bitcoin wallet and the government's commitment to support the digital asset sector.

Pakistan signals new approach to crypto sector

Pakistan's government began shifting its stance on cryptocurrencies earlier this year with the proposal of a “National Crypto Council” in February 2025.

The body was tasked with drafting a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets and attracting foreign investment to the country's growing crypto ecosystem.

Among the Council's early proposals were plans to utilize surplus energy for Bitcoin mining and data center operations, as well as building a national Bitcoin reserve.

Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao was also appointed as an adviser to the Council in April. In this role, he is expected to provide guidance on crypto regulations, blockchain infrastructure, and digital asset adoption.

 SharpLink Gaming intends to use most of the proceeds from its proposed share sell-off to purchase Ether, according to a recent SEC filing. 

US sports betting platform SharpLink Gaming has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer up to $1 billion in shares of common stock in an effort to increase the holdings of its newly launched Ether treasury.

“We intend to use substantially all of the proceeds from this offering to acquire Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain commonly referred to as “ETH,” SharpLink Gaming said in the May 30 filing.

“We also intend to use the proceeds from this offering for working capital needs, general corporate purposes, operating expenses and core affiliate marketing operations,” it said.

It comes after the firm's May 27 announcement that it would be launching an Ethereum-based corporate treasury strategy. 

SharpLink nominated Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as chairman of its board of directors. 

After the announcement, SharpLink Gaming's stock surged 400% during the May 27 trading day.

The filing outlined several risks related to the significant Ether (ETH) purchase, including the introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDC), which “could eliminate or reduce the need or demand for private-sector issued cryptocurrencies, or significantly limit their utility.”

The possibility of Ether being labeled a “security” was also listed as a risk, which the company said would require it to adhere to additional regulations.

The filing led several individuals in the community to compare the betting platform to the Ethereum equivalent of Bitcoin maxi Michael Saylor, known for his aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions through his firm, Strategy. 

At the time of publication, Strategy holds 580,250 Bitcoin, valued at $60.22 billion, as per Saylor Tracker.

Crypto analyst 0xBoboShanti said in an X post, “Ethereum finally has its own Saylor.” Meanwhile, Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano said, “You are not bullish enough.”

Ether is trading at $2,516 at the time of publication, down 4.51% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.

This comes after a new filing by ETF provider REX Shares, which has led analysts to forecast that the first Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs could launch in the US within weeks.

The analysts said REX Shares used “regulatory workarounds,” to potentially get staking into ETFs, something other providers have struggled to do.

Math Puzzle: Mix Water and Wine

By Martin Gardner 

Imagine that you have before you two beakers, one containing a liter of water; the other, a liter of wine. One cubic centimeter of water is transferred to the beaker of wine and the wine and water mixed thoroughly. Then a cubic centimeter of the mixture is transferred back to the water. Is there now more water in the wine than wine in the water? Or vice versa?

The answer is that there is just as much wine in the water as water in the wine. The amusing thing about this problem is the extraordinary amount of irrelevant information involved. It is not necessary to know how much liquid there is in each beaker, how much is transferred, or how many transfers are made. It does not matter whether the mixtures are thoroughly stirred or not. It is not even essential that the two vessels hold equal amounts of liquid at the start! The only significant condition is that at the end each beaker must hold exactly as much liquid as it did at the beginning. When this obtains, then obviously if x amount of wine is missing from the wine beaker, the space previously occupied by this wine must now be filled with x amount of water.

If the reader is troubled by this reasoning, he can quickly clarify it with a deck of cards. Place 26 cards face down on the table to represent wine. Beside them put 26 cards face up to represent water. Now you may transfer cards back and forth in any manner you please from any part of one pile to any part of the other, provided you finish with exactly 26 in each pile. You will then find that the number of face-down cards in either pile will match the number of face-up cards in the other pile.

We'd love to hear from you! E-mail us at games@sciam.com to share your experience.

This story originally appeared on Inside Climate News and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The Trump administration's ever-changing policies on tariffs and trade have injected chaos into the global energy economy.

On Wednesday, a federal court blocked President Donald Trump from being able to adopt tariffs under an emergency-powers law. The administration is appealing the ruling. This sets up additional legal wrangling in addition to the conflicts over trade that were already happening.

Analysts at the research firm Wood Mackenzie gave themselves the task of predicting where US tariff policy may be heading. The result is a report issued this week, “Trading Cases: Tariff Scenarios for Taxing Times,” that shows the huge gap in outcomes between a trade war and a trade truce.

My main takeaway from it is that everyone loses in a prolonged conflict. Even the oil and gas industry, which has close ties to the Trump administration, would face falling prices for its products at the same time that the costs of much of its equipment are rising because of tariffs.

The US renewable energy and battery industries stand out for the potential severity of their downturns because development here relies heavily on components made in other countries. The Biden administration sought to encourage manufacturers to build in the United States, but those efforts are still in their early stages, and many of the government incentives are now on the chopping block.

Under a “trade truce” scenario, in which tariffs return to 2024 levels, the global economy would grow by an average of 2.7 percent between now and 2030, the report says. The “trade tensions” scenario would mean that tariff barriers increase compared to last year, but the economy would still grow, albeit at a lower rate. The most damaging is the “trade war” scenario, with the United States maintaining an effective tariff rate of 30 percent or more, leading to a global recession.

The report says the middle forecast, “trade tensions,” is the most likely to occur.

Why is this conflict happening? The short version is that Trump and his advisers believe that tariffs will help the US economy by encouraging construction of factories here, reducing trade deficits and punishing barriers to entry of US products in other countries.

“We will supercharge our domestic industrial base,” Trump said in an April 2 speech announcing tariffs on nearly every US trading partner. “We will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers and ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers.”

A tariff is a tax charged by a government on imports. As the US government has increased its tariffs, other countries have retaliated with their own increases.

Adding to the chaos is that the policies frequently change, with the president often announcing shifts on social media, as happened in recent days on tariffs on the European Union.

I spoke with Chris Seiple, Wood Mackenzie's vice chairman for power and renewables, to drill down on the parts of the report that deal with renewables. Here is that conversation, edited for length and clarity:

Dan Gearino: For renewable energy industries, is the big problem that tariffs make everything more expensive, or is there more to it than that?

Chris Seiple: Sure, things getting more expensive is a big part of it. I think the second challenge, and this is kind of unique to the power business, is that there's a heavy hand of regulation. And so there's a lot of US utilities that have to go through pretty extensive regulatory processes to get approval for what they want to build. Being in a world where there's so much tariff uncertainty, they don't know what it's going to cost to build what they want to build. It's particularly challenging for this industry to be able to navigate that, and it impacts renewables more than it impacts, say, other sectors like gas or coal, because we rely upon imports of equipment to such a bigger degree, especially for battery storage, where we're essentially entirely dependent at this point on imports from China.

With battery storage, there has been an attempt to increase manufacturing capacity in the US. How would you characterize where that stands?

Very early days. A lot of battery manufacturing that's going on within the US is meant to supply batteries to EV vehicles, not stationary utility-scale storage projects. And so the amount of manufacturing capacity in comparison to what the demand is for that equipment results in us importing well more than 90 percent of what we need.

Chris Seiple is Wood Mackenzie's vice chairman for power and renewables.

I also think the tariff on it is just as important as the uncertainty about not knowing where the end game is and what the tariffs are going to be. So, if you're on the manufacturing side of the renewables business, you're making investment decisions that have very long lives when you're building a manufacturing facility. Having that uncertainty around the investment climate and what the level of tariffs is going to be over the long-term just makes it more challenging to make all of those decisions.

During the early part of this year, as this tariff war was starting, I had, like, biweekly calls from this manufacturer in Korea, just exasperated, saying, “Doesn't the US government know that we're making long lead time decisions, and we need to have some sort of clarity around what the policy environment is going to be, not just for the next four years, but for the next 10 years?” The US is making it very challenging right now to make these types of investment decisions.

Is there any US energy industry that benefits from trade tensions?

I don't think anybody benefits, per se, from the trade tensions. Everybody, no matter what part of the energy sector you're in, is having to navigate the uncertainty around what the tariff levels are going to be. That said, the overall policy environment has changed to one that is more favorable for natural gas. The fact that we are an exporter of natural gas and have all of the domestic resources that we need makes it less impacted by tariffs than what other sectors are, like renewables. But even for E&P [exploration and production of oil and gas], they utilize steel in that process. There are tariffs on steel. Steel prices have gone up. It has a negative impact on all energy sectors.

One part of this report that jumped out to me is you said that the US may be stuck with older technologies, especially when it comes to solar, while the rest of the world advances at a quicker pace. What's the long-term effect of that?

Before I answer that question directly, let me just give you some context.

We estimate that the cost of building a utility-scale solar project is about $1.15 a watt in the US. The comparable number in China is about 42 cents a watt. It's not surprising that the cost of building a solar facility in China is a lot less than the cost of building a solar facility in the US.

What is very surprising when we put this data together is how much less expensive it is to build a solar project in Europe than it is in the US. It's about 70 cents a watt to build a solar facility in Europe compared to the US. So the US is almost 50 percent more expensive to build a solar facility than the cost of building it in Europe. And the biggest reason that it's more expensive here is because of all the tariffs that we have on solar. It's not the only reason, but it's the biggest reason. So we've already kind of penalized solar with the tariffs that we have in place.

And then, on the technology evolution issue, it's the Chinese manufacturers that have the most sophisticated capability in solar manufacturing, and who are putting a lot more R&D into it than any US company is doing. And so, we essentially have policies in place that prohibit and make it uneconomic for US companies to be able to purchase Chinese technology, then that is what leaves us in a position where we're not using the most advanced technology that's available to the rest of the world. The long-term implication of that is it deprives the US of a low-cost source of energy that's available everywhere else, and creates kind of an unlevel playing field in our efforts to have to power our industries with the lowest-cost energy solutions that are available.

These tariff policies seem to change almost daily. Is there an expectation that eventually things will settle down?

I think that's the central challenge for the industry, that they don't know where the ultimate outcome is going to fall. Nobody can really fully answer that question, and what makes it particularly challenging is that there've been so many different rationales given as to why we're pursuing one tariff or another that it makes it hard to divine what the ultimate endgame is going to be. Is it about reducing a trade balance? Is it about supporting domestic manufacturing? Are there other policy goals that are trying to be achieved as a result of the tariffs? Not knowing that is what makes it very difficult for people to operate day to day.

Out of all caffeinated rituals, Turkish coffee takes the (coffee) cake. That's because, according to some experts, Turkish coffee isn't a type of coffee—it's a cooking method. Commonly seen across Middle Eastern cultures, the beverage looks and acts similar to espresso, served in a small cup and tasting very rich yet very different.

Turkish coffee is made with coffee ground finer than espresso (the ideal Turkish coffee grind has a flourlike consistency) and a brewing process that involves boiling three times. It's an unfiltered drink, so the coffee grounds eventually settle to the bottom of the cup. The grounds make for a thick drink, but they also play an important role in the auspicious ritual of fortune telling, a practice that ultimately inspired my love for the brew.

My introduction to Turkish coffee was with my sister's Iranian family (we have different fathers. Her father, Ali, is from Iran). Upon visiting them to celebrate the Persian New Year, my sister's aunt made Turkish coffee after dinner one evening and a family friend proceeded to “read” the coffee grounds and tell us our fortunes (I dive into the specifics of this process more below). While I cannot adhere to the validity of fortune telling, I will say that the family friend predicted I'd have a son. That was over 10 years ago. At the end of 2024, I gave birth to my first child, a healthy baby boy.

But you don't have to get your fortune told to enjoy Turkish coffee. You also don't have to search too far and wide across the coffee forums to find strong opinions about the strong coffee and how it should be made. This was possibly my biggest setback in research, as there are those who suggest beginning the brew with hot water, while others suggest cold water. Some suggest sugar, others without. Some suggest high heat, others low. You might have even seen Turkish coffee being prepared in sand. (The owner at my local Palestinian deli tells me that this is mostly a tourist gimmick.)

So, to the coffee nerds, the anal and the meticulous, if you're hoping for a “right” way to make Turkish coffee, I hate to disappoint you. Those who make Turkish coffee in their home regularly measure and brew with their heart, and each household has a similar but almost always slightly different method. It's your preferences that will ultimately guide the ins and outs of your brewing.

Turkish coffee is often served in a cup that's usually no more than 2 ounces. It might look similar to espresso, but while espresso is brewed under high pressure, Turkish coffee is brewed by boiling finely ground (even more fine of a grind than espresso) coffee in a cezve. A cezve (referred to as an ibrik in other countries like Palestine) is a small pot with a long handle, usually holding around 10 to 15 ounces and made out of copper.

Generally, Turkish coffee is boiled in the cezve in three parts. After each boil, a small amount is poured into the coffee cup. The cezve is returned to the stove after each pour until you've filled your cups. The process of boiling the coffee multiple creates a thick and frothy coffee that is very strong and very aromatic.

Ideally, Turkish coffee is ground with a traditional Turkish coffee grinder like this. Because Turkish coffee is ground to a fineness that most commercial coffee grinders cannot achieve, your best bet is to buy it pre-ground (I've suggested a few brands below). I almost considered using my Sana Grain Mill (8/10, WIRED Recommends) to see if I could achieve the grind, but didn't want to risk the coffee flavor in my homemade flour.

Amazon

Traditionally, finely ground Turkish coffee is mixed with water in a cezve, along with some sugar, depending on your preferences. You'll bring the coffee to a boil on low/medium heat over an open flame, usually in three parts. The first boil will develop a foam (think crema, as seen in other coffee drinks). This foam is essential to Turkish coffee, as the drink's frothy thickness makes it stand out from others. Some recipes suggest using a spoon to scoop the initial foam into your prepared cups. Otherwise, you'll use the cezve to pour it into your prepared coffee cups a little at a time. Put the cezve back on the stove to boil and repeat this process twice more until you've filled your coffee cups to the rim.

Caizen

Amazon

As I mentioned earlier, it's important to note that, unlike other coffee styles in which technicality is prioritized with scales and thermometers, you'll see neither of these aspects come into play when making Turkish coffee. With roots that date back to the 16th century in the Ottoman Empire, Turkish coffee is a drink integrated into and born of a culture. So, think of Turkish coffee like your grandma's cooking—a recipe acts as a guide, but it is ultimately a process that is led with the heart.

You may not place much stock in auspicious practices, and I don't blame you. But in case you're curious, there are traditions to be respected.

The fortune-telling process begins once you've finished your drink. You'll place your coffee cup upside down on its saucer. The grounds will drip and scatter, and this is what the fortune teller will analyze to determine your fortune.

Kurukahveci Mehmet Efendi

Amazon

Just as my family friend read my coffee grounds on that fateful day 10 years ago, the practice of fortune telling through Turkish coffee should be done by someone who is experienced in the craft. It is strongly suggested that you do not try to read your own fortune.

This act of fortune telling also establishes something important when it comes to Turkish coffee: It's a social activity—something meant to be enjoyed with company. It's not a science. A great example of this is my local Palestinian deli using hot water to make its Turkish coffee. Beginning with hot water may go against what some coffee aficionados recommend (beginning with cold water is usually ideal for any brewing process to achieve optimal flavor and extraction), but many places selling Turkish coffee do this to speed up the process and serve their customers more quickly. When making the recipe below, don't focus on being too technical.

Demmex

Amazon

Yields 2 2-ounce cups of Turkish coffee

Combine Turkish coffee, sugar, and water in your cezve. Stir until combined. Put cezve over a low/medium gas stove flame and slowly bring to a boil over a couple of minutes (if it boils too fast, it's harder to develop the initial foam). Once boiling to the top, quickly take the cezve off the stove and pour a small amount into your prepared cups (about half an ounce).

Return the cezve to the open flame and bring to a boil. Repeat steps 3 to 4 twice more until you've filled your cups to the brim. Serve immediately.

I've been an avid biker for as long as I can remember. As a kid, I'd cruise my BMX around town with friends all day during the summer, reveling in the freedom and autonomy that only comes from your own ride. Decades later, my introduction to the ebike scene has provided a renewed sense of that nostalgic joy for the open road.

As a relative newcomer, most of my ebike experience over the past year or so has been with relatively cheap ebikes, like the Propella 9S and Priority's e-Classic Plus. So when Priority offered me a chance to try the much pricier Current Plus, my first question was, “What do you get from an ebike that costs over three grand?”

In this case, the short answer is range, style, features, and power. Lots of power, which may be the biggest key to the Current's success. As a throttle-equipped Class 2 ebike that converts to Class 3, you can absolutely blaze on this thing at up to 28 mph with pedal assist, and there's virtually no hill that can slow you down.

Most importantly, the bike's punchy motor keeps you safe in sketchy situations. Simply kick up the motor speed to level 5 and let the Current Plus fire you through traffic or cut through busy roads. I rarely pushed the motor above the midpoint, but when I needed the power, it swiftly arrived, affording me the freedom to cruise virtually anywhere on Portland, Oregon's mean streets.

The Current's impressive battery range adds to that go-anywhere feeling, letting me ride worry-free for days without the need to top it off. That kind of freedom and autonomy has brought back that BMX feeling, taking me from ebike tourist to true commuter.

As a direct-to-consumer bike, the Current Plus needs some assembly when it arrives. A local bike shop can do the job for you for around $150-200, which I recommend considering for beginners. If you're more ambitious, you can assemble it yourself, but Priority still recommends having a shop give it a once-over for safety.

Otherwise, the Current Plus is extremely hands-off from a maintenance standpoint. The Gates Carbon Drive belt requires no lube or grease and is claimed to last up to “2-3 times longer” than chains, while Priority tested the 750 Wh battery for up to 90 miles per charge on the lowest pedal-assist speed. Letting the bike loose up and down the hills of southeast Portland for weeks, I squeezed out a still-impressive 60 miles per charge, give or take.

I tested the bike with the five-speed Shimano Nexus gear system, but for $200 more you can swap in the Enviolo CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). This is a swap that you might consider if you're hauling a lot of gear—it's much safer to be able to make tiny adjustments to the torque if your bike is heavy or off-balance—but if you don't have a kid or two clinging to the back, you probably won't need it.

While the bike's mid-drive motor is much smoother than the front-mounted eClassic, I noticed some pedal buzz when starting the bike in higher gears. Downshifting to lower-tension gears eliminated the buzz, and the simplified belt drive made it brilliantly smooth to shift to any gear at a standstill. After a few rides, I was shifting and swapping through motor speeds without thinking, like driving a car with a manual transmission.

Before long, I was flying across town like a pro, increasingly leaving my car behind as Portland's rainy winter turned to sunlit spring. And man, does this thing fly. When boxed in at 20 mph as a Class 2 bike, I was hitting the top speed in seconds from anything above the second pedal-assist motor speed, so you'll likely want to convert it to Class 3 from the display settings if local laws allow. After converting, I still only hit around 26 mph on flats, but that was fast enough.

I spent the majority of my time between the first and second pedal-assist speeds, but when I got tired (or curious), moving to the fourth or fifth speeds was a blast. It's empowering to know you can make any hill your … subordinate, allowing you to choose virtually any path to your destination. Need to catch up after a late start or get rid of a car on your tail? Punch up the speed and let it rip. It's truly a joyful feeling.

Priority Current Plus

Rating: 8/10

The Current Plus does have its downsides. At 55 pounds, it can feel sluggish without pedal assist, and without shocks, rocky terrain gets rough. The hydraulic disc brakes, while smoother than both the eClassic and Propella 9S, get noisy when coming down big hills, and the front brake tends to stick on occasion. I also noticed the throttle making a soft clicking noise when engaged and I was freewheeling, but I rarely used it anyway since the pedal assist is faster and more efficient.

Those points aside, this is mostly a premium experience, from the seamless gears to the glitter-flecked, scratch-resistant paint. Touches like the gel-padded seat and composite fenders feel well-made, and the flanged handles provide an ergonomic grip flanked by convenient controls. If I'm judging on style points, I wouldn't mind it if the front cables were smaller, but it's still a sharp-looking bike for its price class.

The Current Plus' big and bright center display is a huge step up from the smaller screens on cheaper models, making it easy to gauge your trip and futz with the settings and swap to Class 3 speeds between 21 and 28 mph (again, check local laws). The screen is so convenient, I found myself wishing I could add Apple CarPlay for mapping and controlling my latest pair of open earbuds, though you can always add a phone mount, of course.

My favorite extra is also the simplest: automated lighting. The 600 lumen front light reacts to your environment, so you'll never need to dig through the settings or worry about visibility when it gets dark. Like the eClassic, the back light gets brighter as you brake, and braking disconnects the motor for safer stopping. It all adds up to a sweet ride that can power you through just about any crosstown trip or long-haul adventure. If you're after an ebike with the range and speed to set you loose like the BMX days of old, the Current Plus has you covered.

Priority Current Plus

Confused by Apple's naming conventions? You're not the only one. Bloomberg reports that this year at WWDC, Apple plans to announce a broad overhaul of all of its operating systems. That includes renaming them to be more consistent. Starting this year, Apple will reportedly begin denoting each OS version for each product by year, instead of by version. Confusingly, it will start with the next year, rather than this year (just like cars). So the versions we'll see at this year's WWDC will not be iOS 25, but rather iOS 26, watchOS 26, and so on, in place of iOS 19 and watchOS 12.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

The move is reportedly part of a larger push toward a cohesive user experience across platforms. The overhaul could encompass everything from updated icons, apps, buttons, and a fresh design language, and it's expected to be universal across all the operating systems. Apple's fundamentally simple and irresistible user interface is a core part of the company's DNA, so it will be interesting to see how customers react to a big redesign (hopefully better than the Apple Photos redesign). We'll find out at WWDC, which kicks off on June 9 at 1 pm ET. —Adrienne So

After a light smattering of features when it launched the OnePlus 13 in January, OnePlus is now ready to go all in on AI for its phones. Its approach is quite similar to what Nothing introduced a few months ago on the Nothing Phone (3a) series: a dedicated AI button on the side of the phone, though this one replaces the original OnePlus Alert Slider.

Dubbed the Plus Key, you can customize it to trigger specific apps or shortcuts on the phone, with an interface that looks almost exactly like Apple's Action Button. By default, it launches AI Plus Mind, a system that will save whatever's on the screen so you can recall it later. The idea is that you'll press it when you see an ad for a concert while browsing, or an event invite—pressing the Plus Key will save the relevant info in the companion app, and the app will extract helpful info to create a calendar event on your behalf.

The Plus Key and AI Plus Mind will debut first on the OnePlus 13s, a phone launching in select markets this June; it's not coming to the US. Later this year, the AI features will roll out to the OnePlus 13 series, with other devices to follow. OnePlus says it's actively working on more features like AI VoiceScribe, to record, summarize, and translate calls and meetings; AI Translation, to consolidate all translation capabilities into one app; and AI Reframe, to adjust the composition of your shots with generative AI.

Samsung is rumored to announce its next generation of folding phones sometime this summer—the Galaxy Z Fold7 and Z Flip7—and the company officially confirmed this in a blog post announcing the rollout of the One UI 8 beta program. One UI is the name of Samsung's Android layer, and version eight is based on the upcoming version of Android 16.

While the beta program will be available for existing devices, Samsung says One UI 8 will “debut on Samsung's newest foldables this summer,” making them the first to run Android 16. That's a break from the norm, as Google historically made its Pixel devices the first to run the latest version of Android. This is likely because Google moved up the Android 16 window; instead of arriving in October, it's coming midsummer.

Google celebrated the 10th anniversary of Google Photos on May 28, and it has dished out a few new features to mark the occasion, including making a few Pixel 9-exclusive capabilities—like the Reimagine and Auto Frame AI features—more broadly available.

A redesigned editor now also shows more editing tools at a glance, and you can also select parts of the image to access specific tools instead of hunting for them in menus. For example, tap the background of an image to pull up the portrait blur tool so you can adjust the strength of the background blur effect. A new “AI Enhance” button will also merge several of Google's AI capabilities, like Magic Eraser, with other standard editing tools for a faster edit. The new redesigned editing layout will roll out to Android devices in June, with iOS getting the update later this year.

Also new is the capability to generate a QR code to share albums with people around you (or print it out for group events). You can let folks who scan the code add their own images to the album, too.

Ricoh has announced the GR IV pocket camera, the successor to the GR III, one of the best pocket cameras I've ever tested. The GR IV has a new lens with seven elements, but it remains the same focal length: 18.3mm f/2.8 (roughly 28mm in 35mm equivalent). So far, no word on whether there will be a GR IVx to replace the 40mm lens model.

The GR IV has an updated APS-C sensor that bumps the resolution slightly from 24 megapixels to 26. The neutral density filter remains, and while the outside appears to have been redesigned, with slightly different buttons, the basic silhouette is the same. Like the GR III, there is no flash. A built-in flash would be nice (the GR II had one), but the ISO range of the GR IV is better, reaching 204,800 ISO at the top end, which should help with low-light photography. There's also five-axis stabilization (up from the three-axis of the GR III).

Perhaps the most interesting news for fans of the GR camera series is that there will be face and eye detection autofocus tracking, which would seem to mean autofocus has been improved. If the GR III has a weakness, it's autofocus. There will also be 53 gigabytes of built-in storage (usable), which is perfect for a camera like this, though my enthusiasm for that is tempered by the fact that the GR IV will use microSD cards rather than full-size SD.

The GR IV is set to arrive this fall, with another model featuring a Highlight Diffusion Filter coming ""after winter 2025."" Interestingly, Ricoh says production and shipment of the Ricoh GR III will stop in July 2025, due to difficulty in procuring parts and components. The 40mm GRIIIx will continue to be sold for now. —Scott Gilbertson

Everybody loves a good foot massage. As an avid runner with plantar fasciitis, I often need a good foot massage. So when I heard about the Nike x Hyperice collaboration to develop a shoe with compression and heating capabilities built in, I was eager to learn more.

The Hyperboots feature the same air compression technology as the beloved-by-runners-everywhere Hyperice Normatec boots ($899). The only downside to the Normatec boots are the fact that you have to chill out and remain horizontal while you wear them (which, maybe isn't exactly a downside, but it still means you can't multitask much during your recovery period). With the Hyperboots, you can enjoy the same squeezing and releasing sensation around your feet and ankles while you go about your life. Thanks to Nike's input, you can wear something that looks more like a sleek, modern sneaker than a recovery device.

The first time I tried on—and turned on—the Hyperboots, I was immediately giddy. There's something very exciting about a shoe with extras built in. It reminded me of Heelys and the popular light-up tennis shoes of my '90s youth. When you turn them on by pressing a power button on the inside of the heel, the shoe automatically inflates to offer a better fit and some mild compression. The compression portion covers the mid-foot at the top and sides, the sides and back of the heel, and the ankle.

I got small Hyperboots (they come in small, medium, large, XL, and XXL) and they were too big for my size-8 feet, but turning on the shoe made comfortable enough to walk around in them without my foot slipping around.

From there, you have the option to adjust the level of compression and heat, with three settings each, and you can press a play button to start an active air-compression massage. The boots sync settings when you have them both on. The air filling up the ankle wrap and releasing does make a droning noise, almost like an airplane flying overhead—nothing too obnoxious. You can charge them up with the two USB-C cords and wall charger they come with, and the charge lasts for up to an hour and a half.

The massage and heat felt wonderful while I did chores around the house. I noticed the plush foam soles and their rocker bottoms, which helped propel me forward with little effort. The forefoot and heel provide grippy traction. The shoes don't offer much in terms of arch support, so I wouldn't recommend walking far in them if you have high, fussy arches like me (without adding some inserts), but they were comfortable enough all the times I wore them.

The upper feels extremely durable, and even with the built-in tech, they can handle splashes and rain (though they aren't fully waterproof). I liked the highest compression setting for my feet, but that setting felt like a bit much around my ankles when I was walking. The top of the ankle wrap dug in a bit when I moved, but it wasn't uncomfortable if I was sitting. The massage runs for 20 minutes, and you can just press play again to start over if your dogs need some more TLC. The heat settings go all the way up to 125 degrees Fahrenheit, which was way too hot for me—I found the lowest setting of 111 degrees to be plenty to feel therapeutic.

After trying the shoes around the house, I was excited to use them after an activity that was harder on my feet. I put them on after a long day snowboarding where I racked up over 13,000 feet of vert, and I was able to drive home through the mountains while my feet warmed up and got a relaxing massage—incredible. The boots flushed out the lactic acid that had built up in my feet and ankles from all the maneuvering they were doing inside my bindings, and I was able to keep the massage going after I got home and while I did laundry and dishes.

Usually when I go to bed after a day on the mountain, my legs ache and it can make it hard to fall asleep. Not the case after wearing the Hyperboots. I wasn't sore that night, or the next day, like I normally am.

I'd love these boots even more if they could somehow extend the air-compression around the bottom of the foot across the arch and heel. As someone with plantar fasciitis, that's where I really need it. The air-compression doesn't feel like a real massage. It's still wonderful and great for increasing blood flow and expediting recovery, but even the highest compression setting couldn't apply as much pressure to my feet as I'd personally prefer.

It would also be amazing if the shoes could provide cooling or icing as well. When I wore these after a handful of runs, they absolutely made my feet feel better and sped up my recovery, but for how much they cost, I wanted more. Still, having these in my rotation during marathon training or after a long hike will be a game-changer. As someone who often ventures to the mountains to train, being able to recover while I'm on the road back—or while I stop at a brewery for a burger and a beer—feels like a cheat code for life.

I'm about to head out on a long weekend road trip that, if all goes to plan, will have me hiking four days in a row. There's no way I'm not packing the Hyperboots. And the one good thing about them running a bit big and being able to somewhat conform to your feet? I can share them with my buddies after our biggest adventures.

Another cool aspect of the Hyperboots is the fact that you can wear them while you warm up for a sport, using the heat and compression to relax and knead your muscles into a flexible, less injury-prone state. I tried this a few times pre-run, and while I enjoyed the feeling and noticed a slight benefit (feeling more warmed up for my run with less effort), I definitely enjoy them more for post-workout recovery. They don't fit me very well, so I couldn't wear them for a whole dynamic warm-up with track drills, though they worked fine for walking around the house before I changed into my running shoes.

When they're not turned on—and therefore not slightly inflated—the Hyperboots feel pretty clunky. They slid around on my feet. The part of the shoe above the mid foot, where the Velcro wrap opens up, also chafes. I wish they came in more sizes so I could get a better fit, and likely, an even better massage. With the chunky heels extending far past my ankle, they also look a bit ridiculous. Not that that really matters, but I'd be more inclined to wear them around in the real world if I could get a slightly smaller size. When people with bigger feet wear them, I think they look cool.

If you struggle with foot and ankle injuries or mobility, the Hyperboots could really upgrade your warm-up and recovery game. Overall, they just feel good. And if you're a high-level athlete, having the latest recovery devices in your arsenal can really make a difference in terms of injury prevention and training and competition performance.

For the average person, these probably won't lead to a huge shift in how you train or race or play your sport of choice, but they certainly won't hurt. It just comes down to whether you want to drop $900 for a recovery tool. If being able to take care of your feet without slowing down is a priority, the Hyperboots could be worth it. Either way, I'm excited to see what Nike and Hyperice do with future iterations. The Hyperboots are just one aspect of a really cool and innovative sector of the recovery industry that lets you seamlessly integrate your rehab tools into your life.

Last week, Google quietly released an app that lets users run a range of openly available AI models from the AI dev platform Hugging Face on their phones. 

Called Google AI Edge Gallery, the app is available for Android and will soon come to iOS. It allows users to find, download, and run compatible models that generate images, answer questions, write and edit code, and more. The models run offline, without needing an internet connection, tapping into supported phones' processors.

AI models running in the cloud are often more powerful than their local counterparts, but they also have their downsides. Some users might be wary of sending personal or sensitive data to a remote data center, or want to have models available without needing to find a Wi-Fi or cellular connection. 

Google AI Edge Gallery, which Google is calling an “experimental Alpha release,” can be downloaded from GitHub by following these instructions. The home screen shows shortcuts to AI tasks and capabilities like “Ask Image” and “AI Chat.” Tapping on a capability pulls up a list of models suited for the task, such as Google's Gemma 3n.  

Google AI Edge Gallery also provides a “Prompt Lab” users can use to kick off “single-turn” tasks powered by models, like summarizing and rewriting text. The Prompt Lab comes with several task templates and configurable settings to fine-tune the models' behaviors. 

Your mileage may vary in terms of performance, Google warns. Modern devices with more powerful hardware will predictably run models faster, but the model size also matters. Larger models will take more time to complete a task — say, answering a question about an image — than smaller models. 

Google's inviting members of the developer community to give feedback on the Google AI Edge Gallery experience. The app is under an Apache 2.0 license, meaning it can be used in most contexts — commercial or otherwise — without restriction.

From AI to EVs, demand for semiconductors is exploding, but silicon is hitting its limits. Making more efficient chips requires new materials, ones far less ubiquitous than sand, but the solution might be out there — literally.

Space Forge, a U.K. startup headquartered in Cardiff, Wales, recently raised a £22.6 million (approximately $30 million) Series A to make wafer materials in space, where unique conditions unlock new possibilities. 

For instance, the Welsh startup earlier won funding for a project through which BT (formerly British Telecom) is hoping to test how integrating crystal materials grown in space could reduce the power consumption of its 5G towers. Because of weightlessness and other properties, crystals made in space have fewer defects, which can help devices use less energy.

Real-world use cases like this help Space Forge convey the message that critical systems could use its technology as an invisible backbone. The whole idea of making chips in orbit may sound like science fiction, but its feasibility has been known since the 1970s, CEO Joshua Western told TechCrunch. 

“We're stood on the shoulders of about 50 years of research when it comes to not only knowing that this is possible, but also knowing that there is a profound improvement in doing so,” Western said.

The improvement in question is obtaining crystals and advanced semiconductor materials with fewer defects and enhanced performance, making them appealing for use in applications such as quantum computing and defense systems.

This dual-use potential explains why NATO Innovation Fund led Space Forge's Series A, and why major U.S. defense contractor Northrop Grumman is one of its partners.

Partners will be key to Space Forge's trajectory: The company won't build rockets and is instead relying on existing space providers for the launch part — a “solved problem,” in Western's words.

It's not just the rockets; from chip manufacturing to space return, Space Forge is tying together technologies that may be described as solved problems, at least on paper. But if you ask Western about its moat, he has a quick retort: “How bloody hard is it to do?!”

That's the price to pay to take advantage of space's unique environment: It requires adapting to harsh conditions such as extreme temperatures and microgravity, Western said. “Physics has the answers, and engineering is how you actually get there.”

Engineering is also needed to bridge the gap between innovation and commercially viable technology. Rather than capsules like Apollo's, Space Forge returns its materials to Earth as “Mary Poppins from space.” Western explained the nickname: “We deploy something that looks very much like an umbrella, [but] that's space grade, and that allows us to float back from space down to the ground.”

Developing new return technology is a key focus of Space Forge. Besides its heat shield, Pridwen, a nod to the legend of King Arthur, the startup also developed Fielder, a floating net to catch returning satellites and ensure a soft landing on water. These efforts were supported by the U.K. Space Agency and European Space Agency, of which the U.K. is still a member despite Brexit.

Establishing a return infrastructure across Europe is one of Space Forge's ambitions — and it is underway. This week, the company opened an office in Portugal on the island of Santa Maria in the Azores, a well-suited location for satellite return in mainland Europe and an important step to convince European partners that this approach can reach industrial scale.

The increasing commoditization of both return and launch technologies is what made the rise of in-space manufacturing startups possible in the first place, with applications also including drug discovery and telecom hardware. But their viability is still very dependent on costs coming down, or in finding clients willing to pay that premium.

Shifting geopolitics could help Space Forge secure more of these clients. Western and his co-founder and CTO Andrew Bacon previously worked at Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales and its Italian peer Leonardo. But the trend is broader than just defense, as concerns mount across Europe over reliance on semiconductors from Taiwan.

 “We urgently need a resilient, homegrown supply of the next-gen supermaterials required for the future of compute. We also need this homegrown chip supply to be produced sustainably,” World Fund general partner Daria Saharova wrote in a statement.

The climate tech VC firm, which co-led Space Forge's seed round and participated in its Series A, is buying into Space Forge's positioning as a “carbon negative technology” that could fight climate change. However, the emissions savings have yet to be proven at scale and rely on commercial adoption to truly offset each mission.

Space Forge, though, still has to complete its first mission. Its first attempt ended after a grand total of six and a half minutes when Virgin Orbit's rocket suffered an anomaly in its launch of Cornwall in 2023, losing its entire payload, including Space Forge's ForgeStar-0 satellite.

With its new funding, the company is now accelerating the development of its latest spacecraft and readying for the launch of its ForgeStar-1 demonstrator later this year, together with Pridwen. And in a nod to the galaxy far, far away, Space Forge announced the mission's official name — “The Forge Awakens” — on May 4.

Meta recently released a new video editing app for creators called Edits. The new app is designed to rival ByteDance's CapCut, a popular short-form video-editing app used by many creators. 

Meta first shared that it was working on Edits back in January after ByteDance-owned CapCut was removed from U.S. app stores when the TikTok ban momentarily went into effect. Although the app has since come back online and is available to download, TikTok's future in the U.S. remains uncertain, so Meta is ready to capitalize on CapCut's possible absence in the future with its new Edits app.

We've created this guide to walk you through the app and the different features it offers, and we provide an overview of how it compares to CapCut. 

Edits is available to download on both iOS and Android. Once you download the app and open it, you will be asked to log in with your Instagram account. 

From there you will see five main tabs: Ideas, Inspiration, Projects, Record, and Insights. The Ideas tab offers creators a space to jot down ideas for new videos and save reels to a collection, and the Inspiration tab features a hub for discovering trending audios and other popular reels. 

The Projects tab is where creators can store and revisit the videos they currently have in progress. This tab is also where creators can upload videos from their phone's camera roll. The Record tab lets creators start filming video content right within Edits. Lastly, the Insights tab gives creators an overview of how their content is performing by surfacing metrics like views, reach, and follower counts. 

Green screen: Replace and edit the background of your videos with one tap.

Timeline: Precisely arrange and adjust clips.

Captions: Add automatic captions to your videos in multiple languages.

Audio library: Add music from Instagram's library to your videos.

Cutouts: Isolate specific objects with precision tracking.

Animate: Turn static images into videos using AI.

Apply all: Apply filters, effects, transitions, and adjustments to all of your clips at once.

Timeline frame rate selector: Convert your video to the frame rate you want in order to enhance playback smoothness. 

Alignment guides: Ensure viewers can see the important parts of your video when posted and accurately position text, emoji, or other elements.

Beat markers: Add auto-detected beat markers to help you align clips, text, and overlays with audio when editing.

Filters: Choose from 30 different filter options to add a unique look to your videos.

Transitions: Choose from 30 different transitions to connect different video clips in a seamless way.

While both Edits and CapCut are great options for editing short-form videos, there are some differences between the two services. 

CapCut offers more robust editing options, including AI features, than Edits does. Of course, this can be expected since Edits is a lot newer than CapCut. Meta will likely continue to build out Edits over the next months and years, so we can expect to see more advanced functionality in the future. It's also worth noting that CapCut has a more extensive music library compared to Edits.

Another difference is the fact that Edits currently doesn't have a subscription offering (for now), but CapCut does. While CapCut offers a free version, some of its advanced tools are locked behind a paid subscription. Edits is free to use, but this will likely change in the future, as Instagram head Adam Mosseri has stated that later versions of Edits may include paid features. 

In addition, while CapCut is available on the web, Edits is mobile-only. However, this could change in the future.

I'm not really tracking the MHz signals thing considering there's the 10 MHz oscillator. It would've been interesting to see an EMI/C report. Usually I can see SMPS frequencies as a spur (especially in PFM mode).For the 32K, at least for the H7 they recommended a ring of ground around it for some shielding. Unsure if that would've helped here. There are also micros that can use their internal RC 32K on vbat. And ones that can do USB without a crystal. The best micro is the one you know, the second best is the one you have. Maybe that's in play here.The LED driver variability was nifty. My first reaction to large IO with tight timing would be an FPGA, but I don't know if they'd like the variable bank supply. It would probably be fine bit the solution used is interesting and works.

It's a two layer board with no attempts made to keep loop areas small, it's going to be bad. Most of what I read of this seems fine at a glance but that part about EMI sticks out as complete nonsense.

That is not correct, with a charitable reading of the text. Which is not to say it'll have good EMI characteristics - you never really know until you get it tested.> Artificially confining ourselves to two layers is exactly the kind of challenge I am wont to be engulfed by. The trick, if you want the board to work well, is to work on only one layer, and keep almost the entirety of the other layer as ground. It is almost always possible to do this, if you're willing to put in enough thought. I rather find that designing circuit boards is a lot like Tetris, and once I'm in the swing of it I can route things for hours on end. It can become a multi-day trance, with dreams of signal integrity and current loop area.Though on this subject:> In contrast, said this one PCB designer, a thin track has a higher inductance, so if you make your power supply lines thin, you'll get a free bit of extra filtering.Inductance in your power supply lines is bad, but I don't have time to get into it right now.

My first thought after reading this statement was to add one Ethernet port to run a NTP server and have PoE capability. Completely overkill for the intended purpose, but I can't help but giggle at the thought of hanging this on a wall in a datacenter and have the clock also provide time-keeping for it.

Those chips are also useful for getting better positions from navigation signals. One could imagine using them to help filter out spoofed signals, for example.

I was just raising a general concern about flicker affecting people with photosensitive epilepsy, but if the multiplexing is indeed at 100 kHz per section, that's definitely outside the problematic range.

There's something truly special about having a quality Bluetooth speaker by your side, especially as summer approaches. Whether you're relaxing on a beach, chilling at a campsite or kicking back by a pool, surrounding yourself with good tunes will elevate any situation and you will be happy you had the chance to enjoy it.

Amazon is running a deal where it has marked down the popular and iconic Beats Pill portable Bluetooth speaker to an all -time low, clearing out inventory just in time for summer. Right now, you can get this popular speaker for just $99, which is $50 cheaper than the original list price of $149. This summer's deal has already moved over 4,000 units in the last month with a rating of 4.6 out of 5-stars from more than 1,600 reviews.

See at Amazon

The Beats Pill is a speaker, but it's also a lifestyle accessory: The design is portable and instantly recognizable and the performance is impressive. The Pill can deliver deep and powerful sound and a room filled with sound thanks to a larger, custom racetrack woofer that displaces 90% more air volume than previous iterations.

The bass comes with a punch when you crank it while hosting a backyard barbecue or chillin' when the only thing on your agenda is enjoying peace and quiet at the lake. The tweeter has also been redesigned for some extra stability for those nice crisp highs and rich mid-range tones, while the new woofer material and structure makes it easier to reduce low-end distortion even at reasonable volumes. No matter where you listen, it is dynamic and crystal clear.

The battery life of the Beats Pill is nothing short of amazing and a single charge will last you approximately 24 hours: That is all day, and into the night with all of the music you could want. Plus, if your phone or other device needs a charge, the Pill can charge those devices via USB-C cable and save you from running out of power.

It is rated IP67 dust and water-resistant, so you don't have to worry if you get sand on it, or a splash of water: It will hold up and even for sudden rain showers. The Beats Pill comes with a removable lanyard and soft-grip silicone backing which makes it easy to carry or to handle no matter where your summer adventures lead you.

On top of the Bluetooth connection, audiophiles can enjoy high-resolution lossless audio when used via USB-C to a laptop or other desktop computers. If you want to get serious about sound and double the output, you can pair two Beats Pill speakers together in Amplify mode or Stereo mode. Either way, you will amplify the fun of listening to music. You might even get some extra friends over for the party?

Amazon has the all-time lowest price available for the Pill just before the summer months, and now is your chance to get your very own Beats Pill!

Update (5/31/2025 @ 1:23 PM ET): More Black Phone 2 teasers have emerged: one, from Derrickson, shows the Grabber's lair in the original movie has fallen apart since his death. Grafitti on the walls call for him to burn in hell, but the place might not be as abandoned as it seems. Another shows the Grabber's various masks buried in the ice and someone trying to get at one of them, followed by quick flashes of black balloons, someone struggling inside a van, and a half-burned victim. The two words featured in the teasers are “a” and “dead,” and when put together with the previous ones, it looks like you've got the film's tagline: “Dead is just a word.”

More teaser videos for BLACK PHONE 2 just arrived on our phone via a mysterious text message from an unknown number 😱 📞 pic.twitter.com/4FIYWQQ5c6

— Fandango (@Fandango) May 31, 2025



Original story: In 2022, horror duo Scott Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill of Sinister fame teamed to adapt Joe Hill's short story The Black Phone. Things wrapped pretty conclusively in that one, but you can't keep a good Grabber (Ethan Hawke) down it seems, because he's back in a sequel coming this fall.

The first film saw Finn (Mason Thames) kidnapped by the Grabber and stuck in a room with a rotary phone that could contact ghosts of the killer's previous victims. With their help, Finn killed the Grabber and reunited with his family. In anticipation for Black Phone 2, Blumhouse's released three teasers that let you know the Grabber's returned and set his sights on kids at Colorado's Alpine Lake Youth Camp during the winter.

“The phone is ringing again. Are you going to answer?”

We just got a text that included the first tease for BLACK PHONE 2! Only in theaters this October. pic.twitter.com/ckfgKx9nUT

A third video teasing BLACK PHONE 2 just arrived in the form of another mysterious text message… on our phone 😱 pic.twitter.com/vjrS9xguDQ

— Fandango (@Fandango) May 31, 2025



Each of the teasers contain grainy shots of the snow-covered camp and its various facilities, photos of young boys kidnapped and what remains of them after the Grabber's finished. (One victim's left in the ice, another folded under a bed, and the third has half his face burned and appears throughout all of them, either looking at the camera or appearing and disappearing without a word.) Each teaser also has a single word flash onscreen, which spell out the phrase “Word is Just.” Finally, there's a phone booth somewhere on the premises with its own black phone, which keeps ringing and is waiting for someone to answer.

Back at April's CinemaCon, Universal showed off Black Phone 2 footage teasing the Grabber is using the titular phone to come back and haunt the surviving kids from the previous movie. If that's the case, he certainly hasn't lost a step, and we'll find out what other tricks he's got up his sleeve when the film releases October 17.

Intel Arrow Lake vs AMD Zen 5, Fight!


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Today, we pit Intel's current-gen flagship Core Ultra 9 285K vs Ryzen 7 9800X3D, the hands-down best CPU for gaming on the market, in a heated six-round match to find the winner.

The flagship of Intel's Arrow Lake-S lineup, the $590 Intel Core Ultra 9 285K, represents the best of the best that Team Blue currently has on offer. As a successor to the powerful Core i9-14900K, the Core Ultra 9 285K ushers in an entirely new platform as well as a brand new naming scheme, for better or for worse.

Going up against the mighty Intel flagship is the $480 Ryzen 7 9800X3D, a high-end desktop CPU from AMD's Zen 5 lineup, augmented with the acclaimed 3D V-Cache technology. AMD's standard Zen 5 CPUs certainly put up a good fight against the newest Intel flagship when it comes to CPU benchmarks, but the new X3D processors aim to take a substantial lead in gaming.

We have already taken an in-depth look at both of these CPUs in our detailed reviews, and we have also compared the Core Ultra 9 285K vs the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D, but now it's time for a more enticing comparison.

Can the $480 Ryzen 7 9800X3D go toe-to-toe with the $590 Core Ultra 9 285K? Let's put these two CPUs through our rigorous gauntlet of tests and decide which CPU you should buy for your rig this summer.

The Intel Core Ultra 285K and AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D represent divergent philosophies in modern CPU design, with Intel prioritizing hybrid core scalability and AMD focusing on cache-optimized performance.

The Core Ultra 285K, part of Intel's Arrow Lake-S lineup, leverages a hybrid architecture with eight high-performance ""Lion Cove"" P-cores and 16 efficiency-focused ""Skymont"" E-cores, totaling 24 cores and threads. This setup targets multitasking and heavily threaded workloads, though E-cores are less impactful in latency-sensitive tasks.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

In contrast, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D adopts a monolithic eight-core/16-thread Zen 5 design, augmented by AMD's 3D V-Cache technology, which stacks an additional 64MB of L3 cache atop the existing 32MB (96MB total). This configuration prioritizes gaming and applications sensitive to memory latency, sacrificing pricing for specialized cache advantages.

Architecturally, the Core Ultra 285K is built on the 3nm production process, promising significant efficiency gains over previous nodes. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D utilizes TSMC's refined N4P (4nm) process, optimizing power efficiency while retaining compatibility with AM5 motherboards via BIOS updates. Clock speeds diverge sharply: Intel's chip operates at a base of 3.7 GHz and boosts up to 5.7 GHz on P-cores, while AMD's X3D variant, constrained by thermal limits from its stacked cache, maintains a lower base of 4.7 GHz and peak boost of 5.2 GHz.

Memory and platform support further highlight their differences. The Core Ultra 285K supports DDR5-6400 natively and requires Intel's new LGA1851 socket with 800-series chipsets, necessitating motherboard upgrades. It also features a PCIe 5.0 controller and supports Thunderbolt 4.

The Ryzen 7 9800X3D retains compatibility with existing AM5 motherboards (X670/B650), reducing upgrade costs, and supports DDR5-5600 officially, though EXPO overclocking enables higher speeds. AMD's chip lacks Thunderbolt but includes the PCIe 5.0 interface for GPUs and NVMe storage. Both CPUs align with industry standards, but Intel's platform demands newer infrastructure for full feature access.

The Core Ultra 285K has a base TDP of 125W and a turbo power limit (PL2) of 250W, typical of Intel's hybrid architecture under heavy loads. AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D operates at a 120W TDP, with tighter thermal constraints due to the 3D V-Cache's sensitivity to heat. While Intel's higher power envelope suits enthusiasts with robust cooling, AMD's efficiency-focused approach appeals to users prioritizing thermals and noise.

🏆Winner: Tie

The Core Ultra 285K and Ryzen 7 9800X3D cater to distinct user bases. Intel's hybrid core layout and cutting-edge node aim for productivity supremacy, whereas AMD's cache-centric design and AM5 stability prioritize gaming and upgradability. It is up to the potential buyer to decide which specs best cater to their needs, but by the spec sheet alone, Intel is competitive in this round due to its higher core count and clock speed, but AMD's chip comes with a beefy 96MB of L3 cache that the 285K's miserly 36MB simply can't match. That leaves us with a tie in this category.

Below we provide an overview of the gaming performance of both these CPUs, but you can always consult our in-depth reviews for an even more detailed analysis. These benchmark graphs display the average FPS and 1% lows for a wide range of games at 1080p, highlighting the difference between the two CPUs.

We paired the CPUs with the powerful Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card to minimize any bottlenecks that may occur. This particular test configuration is ideal for analyzing the difference in CPU performance without worrying about a GPU bottleneck.

The gaming performance comparison between the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Intel Core 9 285K is a beatdown, with the AMD processor coming out on top. Based on our thorough testing results, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D delivers an average of 195.5 FPS across 16 games at the 1080p resolution, which is approximately 35% faster than the Core 9 285K's 144.9 FPS average. This performance gap represents a significant advantage for AMD, especially considering the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is priced at $480 compared to the Core 9 285K's $590 price tag.

When examining frame consistency, which is critical for smooth gameplay, the difference is also noticeable. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D maintains a 1% low framerate of 134 FPS, compared to the Core 9 285K's 107 FPS. This 25% advantage in minimum framerates means the AMD chip provides noticeably smoother gameplay with fewer stutters or frame drops during graphically intensive moments.

The exceptional gaming performance of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D can be directly attributed to AMD's innovative 3D V-Cache technology. This architecture stacks additional L3 cache vertically on the CPU die, dramatically increasing the total cache available to the processor. While the Core 9 285K relies on traditional cache arrangements, the Ryzen's expanded cache capacity allows it to store substantially more game data close to the execution cores, reducing the need to access slower system RAM.

The Ryzen 7 9800X3D's dominance is particularly pronounced in titles like Baldur's Gate 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. In Baldur's Gate 3, the 9800X3D delivers 175.2 FPS on average (117 FPS 1% low), while the 285K manages only 117.1 FPS (88 FPS 1% low)—a 49% advantage for AMD. Similarly, in Cyberpunk 2077, the 9800X3D achieves 143.7 FPS (111 FPS 1% low) compared to the 285K's 118.9 FPS (99 FPS 1% low), a 20.9% advantage. These gains are a direct result of the 3D V-Cache's ability to keep frequently accessed game data readily available, minimizing stalls and improving frame pacing.

What makes the 3D V-Cache so effective for gaming, specifically, is how modern games access memory. Games typically have non-sequential memory access patterns with limited predictability, making them highly sensitive to memory latency rather than just bandwidth. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D's larger cache serves as an effective buffer against these memory access penalties, keeping more critical game data close to the execution cores. This directly translates to the 35% higher average frame rates and 25% better frame consistency demonstrated in our benchmark results.

From a value perspective, the comparison becomes even more favorable toward AMD. Not only does the Ryzen 7 9800X3D outperform the Intel Core 9 285K by a substantial margin, but it also costs approximately $120-140 less. This creates a scenario where gamers get significantly better performance while spending nearly 25% less on their CPU.

🏆Winner: AMD

For competitive gamers seeking every possible advantage, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D's 35% faster average gaming performance provides headroom that could be crucial in high-refresh-rate gaming scenarios. The smoother frame delivery, evidenced by the 1% low metrics, also contributes to more consistent input response and system predictability.

The Ryzen 7 9800X3D's 3D V-Cache gives it a decisive edge over the Core 9 285K in gaming, delivering higher average FPS, smoother 1% lows, and better scalability. While the 285K remains a capable gaming CPU, it cannot overcome the architectural advantages of AMD's cache-rich design, making the 9800X3D the clear choice for enthusiasts prioritizing raw gaming performance.

The Intel Core Ultra 9 285K and AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D exhibit stark differences in productivity performance, particularly in multi-threaded workloads. In Cinebench 2024's multi-core benchmark, the 285K scores 2496, outpacing the 9800X3D's 1376 by 81%, a decisive advantage in favor of Team Blue. This significant lead highlights the Core Ultra 9 285K's superior scalability across multiple cores, making it a powerhouse for heavily parallelized workloads, such as 3D rendering, video encoding, or simulation tasks.

This gap widens further in POV-Ray's multi-core test, where the 285K achieves 15,464 PPS compared to the 9800X3D's 7,783—a 98.6% lead. These results highlight Intel's dominance in raw multi-threaded throughput, likely due to its higher core and thread count, as well as its architectural efficiency in distributed workloads.

Single-threaded performance, while less lopsided, still favors the 285K. In Cinebench 2024's single-core test, the 285K scores 148.9, edging out the 9800X3D's 134.5 by 10.7%. The disparity grows in POV-Ray's single-core benchmark, where the 285K's 1,116 PPS outperforms the 9800X3D's 791 by 41%.

The Lame benchmark, which measures single-threaded audio encoding (converting a 250MB WAV to MP3), shows a closer race, with the Core Ultra 9 285K completing the task in 8.83 seconds versus the Ryzen 7 9800X3D's 9.05 seconds—a difference of 0.22 seconds, or roughly 2.4%. Intel's superior single-threaded performance suggests advantages in latency-sensitive tasks like application startup or lightly threaded software.

The overall geomean rankings reinforce these trends. In multi-threaded productivity, the 285K occupies a higher tier, while the 9800X3D lags significantly by a margin of nearly 69%. The single-threaded Geomean places the 285K at 276 versus the 9800X3D's 243, a 13.6% delta. These metrics underscore Intel's consistent lead across both workload types, though AMD's lower price ($480 vs $590) may appeal to budget-focused users willing to trade peak performance for value.

The Core Ultra 9 285K's architecture, likely benefiting from higher clock speeds and improved IPC (instructions per cycle), gives it an edge in single-threaded scenarios, while its higher core and thread count, paired with efficient multi-core scaling, drive its dominance in multi-threaded tests.

🏆Winner: Intel

The Core Ultra 9 285K is the unequivocal choice for users prioritizing maximum multi-threaded performance, with leads exceeding 80% in key benchmarks. The 9800X3D, while more affordable, struggles to compete in these scenarios, making it better suited for gaming-focused builds or workloads where its cache architecture can mitigate its raw compute shortcomings. For general productivity, Intel's offering delivers a compelling performance premium, albeit at a higher cost.

The Intel Core Ultra 9 285K and AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D exhibit fundamentally different approaches to overclocking, reflecting their architectural priorities. Intel's platform emphasizes granular control, offering unlocked multipliers for both performance (P) and efficiency (E) cores, along with separate voltage adjustments for each core type. This allows enthusiasts to fine-tune frequencies in small increments while balancing power delivery across the hybrid architecture.

The processor's thermal design also supports aggressive tuning, with a configurable TjMax up to 115°C compared to AMD's 95°C limit. However, Intel's overclocking potential remains constrained by the inherent complexity of managing 24 heterogeneous cores (8P+16E), requiring careful coordination between core types.

AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D breaks new ground for 3D V-Cache processors by introducing Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) support, marking the first time an X3D chip has official overclocking capabilities. The redesigned cache placement—now beneath the compute die rather than stacked atop it—improves thermal conductivity, addressing a key limitation that previously restricted manual tuning on X3D models.

While the multiplier remains unlocked, AMD's approach prioritizes automated frequency optimization through its boost algorithms, with manual adjustments primarily focusing on power limits and thermal thresholds rather than raw clock speeds. This reflects the inherent challenges of overclocking cache-sensitive designs.

Intel's platform offers a more traditional overclocking experience, featuring extensive BIOS-level controls, including per-core frequency adjustments and independent voltage regulation for different core types. This makes the Core Ultra 9 285K better suited for enthusiasts willing to invest time in meticulous tuning.

AMD's solution offers greater accessibility through its Ryzen Master software, which simplifies PBO configuration while maintaining safeguards for the delicate 3D cache structure.

🏆Winner: Intel

For most users, the 9800X3D's automated boost algorithms deliver near-maximum performance without manual intervention, but it lacks Intel's depth of low-level control. Ultimately, the Core Ultra 9 285K's architectural flexibility and higher thermal limits make it the more overclocking-friendly option for dedicated tuners, while the 9800X3D prioritizes out-of-the-box efficiency with limited but accessible manual tuning capabilities

The Intel Core Ultra 9 285K and AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D exhibit distinct power consumption profiles across idle and load scenarios, reflecting their architectural differences.

In idle states, the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K demonstrates superior efficiency compared to the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D. The pure idle power consumption test shows the Core Ultra 9 285K drawing just 16 watts compared to the Ryzen 7 9800X3D's 20 watts, representing a 20% power advantage for Intel. This difference is relatively consistent when examining the active idle scenario (such as during YouTube playback), where Intel's chip consumes 23 watts versus AMD's 29 watts, maintaining a 20.7% efficiency advantage. Intel's architecture appears more optimized for low-power states, which could benefit users who leave their systems idle for extended periods.

Under heavy multi-threaded AVX workloads, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D showcases dramatically better efficiency. In the y-cruncher benchmark, the AMD chip consumes 176W, while the Core 9 285K draws 287W—a staggering 63% more power for Intel. In the Prime95 benchmark with AVX instructions enabled (representing intensive workloads), the Core Ultra 9 285K draws a substantial 325 watts of power, while the Ryzen 7 9800X3D consumes just 171 watts. This represents a staggering 90% higher power consumption for the Intel processor, which is offset by higher performance.

In our efficiency benchmarks, the results are mixed. The Core 9 285K edges out the Ryzen 7 9800X3D in Cinebench 2024's “Watts per Point” metric, scoring 10.3 vs. AMD's 10.2 (higher is better). However, this marginal 1% difference pales compared to the y-cruncher disparity.

The Blender Classroom efficiency chart offers perhaps the most illuminating comparison of real-world efficiency. This benchmark plots task energy (in kilojoules) against performance (samples per minute), with the ideal position being the bottom-right corner, where more performance is achieved with less energy.

The Core Ultra 9 285K delivers approximately 120-130 samples per minute but requires around 29,000-32,000 kilojoules to do so. In contrast, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D delivers fewer samples (approximately 80-90 per minute) but consumes dramatically less energy at approximately 10,000-12,000 kilojoules. This means that while Intel's processor is roughly 40-50% faster in raw performance, it consumes nearly three times the energy to achieve this performance advantage, making the AMD solution significantly more efficient on a performance-per-watt basis.

Cooling requirements align closely with power consumption, as higher wattage translates to greater heat output. The Intel Core Ultra 9 285K's peak load consumption of 325 watts in Prime95 demands robust cooling, potentially a 360mm AIO liquid cooler, to manage temperatures effectively, especially given that its thermal output could exceed 90°C under stress.

In contrast, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D's 171 watts in the same test consumes roughly half the power, which is manageable with a mid-range air cooler or a 240mm AIO, keeping temperatures below 80°C. Even at idle, the 7-watt difference (16W vs. 20W) is negligible for cooling compared to load demands. Thus, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D's lower thermal profile makes it significantly easier to cool, reducing system costs and noise levels.

🏆Winner: AMD

Based on the comprehensive power consumption data, the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D emerges as the clearly superior choice for energy efficiency, particularly under load conditions where the difference is most pronounced. While Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K does hold a 20% advantage in idle power consumption, this benefit is overshadowed by its substantially higher power draw during actual computation tasks.

For users prioritizing energy efficiency, lower heat output, quieter operation, or systems with limited cooling capacity, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D represents a significantly better option. The Intel processor may justify its higher power consumption only in specific use cases where its raw performance advantage outweighs efficiency concerns; however, in most scenarios, AMD's offering delivers a much better balance of performance and power consumption.

Intel launched the Core Ultra 9 285K with a price tag of $620, but nowadays it can be found retailing for around $590. At first glance, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D holds a clear price advantage, retailing at $480 compared to the Core Ultra 9 285K's $590 price tag—a $119 (20%) savings on the CPU alone. However, platform costs (such as motherboard, RAM, and cooling) must be taken into consideration when evaluating the overall value proposition of modern CPUs.

Intel's LGA 1851 platform (and the new 800-series chipsets) demands premium pricing for full feature access, with mid-range boards averaging between $250–$300. AMD's AM5 platform, although initially more expensive, now offers budget-friendly B650 boards starting at $150–$200, providing comparable PCIe 5.0 and even overclocking support. You can even step up to an X670 motherboard, and the overall platform cost will still be lower than a comparable Intel setup.

The Ryzen 7 9800X3D also benefits from AM5's longevity, with AMD committing to socket support through 2025+, allowing for future upgrades without requiring a motherboard swap. Intel's LGA 1851 is expected to last only 1–2 generations, limiting long-term value. Both CPUs use DDR5 RAM, but AMD's EXPO optimization often allows tighter timings at similar costs.

The Core 9 285K's has a higher peak power draw, as we have already discussed, which necessitates a high-end air cooler ($80–$100) or a 240 mm+ AIO liquid cooler ($120+). In contrast, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D's lower peak power draw can be managed with a mid-range air cooler ($40–$60), saving quite a decent chunk of change.

The Ryzen 7 9800X3D dominates in power-sensitive workloads (e.g., 63% lower power draw in y-cruncher), reducing long-term electricity costs for heavy users. While the Core 9 285K edges ahead in lightly threaded tasks, even though this marginal advantage doesn't offset its platform premium. For gaming, AMD's 3D V-Cache typically delivers superior frame rates, further justifying its value.

🏆Winner: AMD

Combining all the categories, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the unequivocal value champion. Its significant platform savings, combined with superior efficiency, lower cooling demands, and future-proof AM5 compatibility, make it ideal for value-conscious builders and upgraders. For 95% of users—especially gamers—the Ryzen 7 9800X3D delivers higher performance per dollar and long-term savings.

While the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K offers stronger multi-core performance, its higher cost and greater cooling demands make it less appealing unless the user specifically requires its productivity-focused features.

Conversely, the Core Ultra 285K's hybrid architecture, with its 24 cores and aggressive boost clocks, excels in productivity workloads such as video rendering, 3D modeling, and multitasking, where thread count and raw throughput are more crucial. This split highlights a recurring industry trend: AMD optimizes for specialized efficiency, while Intel focuses on multi-threaded scalability.

The price-to-performance conversation further tilts the scales. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D not only undercuts Intel's offering in cost but also leverages AM5 platform longevity, allowing users to upgrade CPUs without replacing motherboards—a boon for budget-conscious builders. Intel's LGA1851 platform, while future-proofed, demands a pricier motherboard overhaul.

However, the Core Ultra 285K justifies its premium with higher performance in productivity workloads, Thunderbolt 4 support, and higher DDR5 speeds, appealing to professionals needing cutting-edge I/O or memory bandwidth. Value here is subjective: AMD caters to cost-aware gamers, while Intel targets power users willing to invest in top-tier productivity.

⭐Winner: AMD

The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D comes out on top in our faceoff, but there's plenty of nuance. While this chip is a stellar performer for gaming and presents a wonderful value, it simply can't match the 285K's prowess in productivity workloads. That's not surprising, given the price delta.

Ultimately, the decision hinges on use case and personal preference. If gaming dominates your workload, the Ryzen's cache advantage and lower thermal footprint make it irresistible — the Ryzen 7 9800X3D remains the undisputed gaming champion in this general price range. For creators and professionals, Intel's hybrid cores and frequency headroom offer stronger performance in demanding tasks, leaving it a smaller audience in enthusiast builds.

Both CPUs excel within their niches, reflecting a market where specialization trumps one-size-fits-all solutions. Your choice isn't about what's “better”—it's about what's better for you.

Working within the limitations of their 3D printer's bed size is both a challenge and part of the norm for many makers. However, Ivan Miranda and John from Proper Printing have created an infinite print bed by turning a treadmill into a working, giant 3D printer. Their creation can print things on a massive scale, and we absolutely love it.

According to Miranda, he had plans to transform a treadmill into a 3D printer for a while. His friend John had the same idea, and the two quickly got to work on turning their crazy concept into a tangible reality. The result is this impressive 3D printer that works unlike anything we've ever seen.

The 3D printer is a belt printer with all sorts of unique design quirks necessary for a creative project like this. The extruder operates at an angle because it is installed on the treadmill handles. The treadmill belt acts as the print bed and can move prints away from the extruder as they continue. This makes printing massive things with a theoretically infinite bed size possible.

The prints detach easily from the bed as they pull away from the extruder, thanks to the way they curl under the machine once they reach the edge. Plans are in the works to test the limits of their creation, but so far, we're already impressed. Everything from the hardware assembly to the slicing methodology had to be developed from scratch for the project.

Miranda uploaded a video demonstrating the printer in action. In it, we see the treadmill 3D printer print a 2-meter-long I-beam. This impressive feat took approximately 36 hours to complete, which isn't too bad. The team intends to take things a step further by using the setup to 3D print a kayak.

Creating your 3D printer is cool, but there's nothing wrong with buying one to get started. If you're new to 3D printing or want to see what's currently leading the market, check out our list of the best 3D printers to see which ones we recommend.

A blower-style version of the RTX 5090 GPU has emerged online courtesy of hardware leaker Olrak20_ on X (formerly Twitter). The photos, which seem to be from a facility in China, show multiple units of the GPU packed in boxes and ready for shipment. Curiously, the GPU has a serial number sticker which mentions ‘RTX5090 32G D7 Turbo', suggesting that the GPU in question is not the RTX 5090D, officially meant for the Chinese market.

To date, Nvidia partners have not announced any blower-style variant of the RTX 5090. A blower-style GPU includes a single fan to draw in air, and hot air is exhausted from the back of the case. This makes it suitable for systems with limited space and servers, workstations, or multi-GPU setups where managing internal heat is important. Unlike open-air cooled GPUs that tend to recirculate warm air inside the case, blower cards can help lower ambient temperatures by removing all the hot air.

Last month, a similar-looking blower-style RTX 5090D was spotted on Chinese video platform Bilibili. It featured a two-slot design, a rear-mounted 16-pin power connector, and a large open section at the bottom. The video also validated that it included the GB202 chip paired with 32 GB of GDDR7 VRAM. This new leak, however, feels less official and more like an opportunistic offshoot.



The RTX 5090 can draw up to 575W of power, which means a blower cooler may struggle to handle such high thermal output levels without throttling or excessive noise. While that raises doubts about the card's thermal capability, there's a chance that these GPUs are meant for an AI (Artificial Intelligence) training or an enterprise setup.

It is also important to note that the GPU and the boxes do not have branding, which further suggests that they might be gray-market or unauthorized units that originated through unofficial or illicit channels. Recently, the U.S. government requested that the Malaysian trade minister tighten security and monitor tech exports to China to crack down on chip smugglers.



Nvidia has not commented on the images or confirmed any such SKU in development. Until the company or a board partner offers a statement, the origin and legitimacy of these blower-style RTX 5090 units remain unclear. Whether they are engineering samples, modified OEM hardware, or originating from unauthorized supply chains, the appearance of such GPUs raises doubts over supply chain security and the growing demand for high-performance GPUs in China.

 May 31, 2025  

Treatment with pembrolizumab and the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) sacituzumab govitecan improved progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with PD-L1-positive locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) compared with treatment with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, the results of ASCENT-04/KEYNOTE-D19 showed. 

Swapping in sacituzumab govitecan for chemotherapy led to a 3.4-month improvement in PFS and an almost twofold longer duration of response, with potentially fewer adverse events and a lower rate of discontinuations.

Currently, pembrolizumab with chemotherapy is the standard of care for PD-L1-positive TNBC, but the 3-year survival rate remains low at about 36%.

These findings support sacituzumab govitecan and pembrolizumab as the new standard for previously untreated patients in this setting, said lead investigator Sara Tolaney, MD, MPH, who presented the results at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2025 annual meeting.

Once the new combination with sacituzumab govitecan, which targets the Trop-2 protein on tumor cells, is approved, “I would recommend it in the first-line setting,” said Tolaney, a breast medical oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.

“I think this really does change the game for” PD-L1-positive metastatic TNBC, said study discussant Jane Meisel, MD, a breast medical oncologist at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia. “I look forward to seeing this potentially make its way into clinical practice.”

The study included 443 women who had either de novo metastatic disease or were at least 6 months away from completing systemic therapy for early-stage disease. Patients had a combined positive PD-L1 score of 10 or higher, and about 40% of TNBC tumors expressed the Trop-2 protein.

Half of the patients were randomly assigned to 10 mg/kg sacituzumab govitecan on day 1 and day 8, plus pembrolizumab 200 mg on day 1 of 21-day cycles for a maximum of 35 cycles (n = 221). The other half were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab on the same schedule plus investigators' choice of gemcitabine plus carboplatin or paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel (n = 222). 

Approximately 5% of patients had received a prior checkpoint inhibitor for earlier-stage disease; 43% of women in the chemotherapy arm crossed over to sacituzumab govitecan monotherapy after progression. 

At a median follow-up of 14 months, median PFS was 11.2 months in the sacituzumab govitecan group vs 7.8 months in the chemotherapy group, which translated to a 35% lower risk of cancer progression during follow-up (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; P = .0009). 

Tolaney noted that PFS in the ADC group increased with higher Trop-2 expression, but the ADC group also did better than the chemotherapy arm regardless of Trop-2 levels, suggesting that “you didn't need to preselect patients for use of sacituzumab by Trop-2.” 

Median duration of response was 16.5 months with sacituzumab govitecan vs 9.2 months with chemotherapy. Although overall survival follow-up is ongoing, the trend favors the ADC group (HR, 0.89). 

Commenting on the study, Julie Gralow, MD, a breast medical oncologist at the University of Washington, Seattle, noted that sacituzumab govitecan is already indicated as monotherapy in the third or later lines for metastatic disease. The ASCENT-04 results “will likely move this drug, this regimen, earlier in the metastatic setting” for TNBC, Gralow agreed. 

On the side effect front, the most common (≥10% of patients) grade 3 and 4 adverse events in the sacituzumab govitecan group were neutropenia (43%) and diarrhea (10%); in the chemotherapy group, the most common adverse events were neutropenia (45%), anemia (16%), and thrombocytopenia (14%).

Serious adverse events were numerically more common in the ADC arm (38 vs 31), but there were fewer dose reductions and fewer treatment discontinuations than with chemotherapy.

“The nice thing is that many of us have used both of these agents, sacituzumab and pembrolizumab, quite a bit,” and with no new safety signals, breast oncologists will “feel comfortable with [the combination] once it makes its way into the clinic,” Meisel said. 

The work was funded by Gilead Sciences, maker of sacituzumab govitecan. Tolaney disclosed research and travel funding from Gilead and is a Gilead advisor. Gralow and Meisel reported no relevant financial relationships.

On World No Tobacco Day, the World Health Organization (WHO) today launches a new publication and calls on governments to urgently ban all flavors in tobacco and nicotine products, including cigarettes, pouches, hookahs and e-cigarettes to protect youth from addiction and disease.

Flavors like menthol, bubble gum and cotton candy are masking the harshness of tobacco and nicotine products turning toxic products into youth-friendly bait. flavors not only make it harder to quit but have also been linked to serious lung diseases. Cigarettes, which still kill up to half of their users, also come in flavors or can have flavors added to them.

""Flavors are fuelling a new wave of addiction, and should be banned,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. ""They undermine decades of progress in tobacco control. Without bold action, the global tobacco epidemic, already killing around 8 million people each year, will continue to be driven by addiction dressed up with appealing flavors.""

The publication, flavor accessories in tobacco products enhance attractiveness and appeal reveals how flavors and accessories like capsule filters and click-on drops are marketed to bypass regulations and hook new users.

Flavors are a leading reason why young people try tobacco and nicotine products. Paired with flashy packaging and social media-driven marketing, they've increased the appeal of nicotine pouches, heated tobacco, and disposable vapes into addictive and harmful products, which aggressively target young people.

We are watching a generation get hooked on nicotine through gummy bear-flavored pouches and rainbow-coloured vapes. This isn't innovation, it's manipulation. And we must stop it.""

Dr. Rüdiger Krech, WHO Director of Health Promotion

WHO reiterates that tobacco products, including heated tobacco products expose users to cancer-causing chemicals and should be strictly regulated.

According to recent data, the Region of the Americas currently has the second highest prevalence of tobacco use among adolescents aged 13 to 15 years, with 11.9% of boys and 10.7% of girls reporting use. The region also shows the smallest gender gap, indicating a concerning equalization in consumption patterns. At the same time, the use of electronic cigarettes is on the rise, particularly among adolescents and youth. In this age group, the regional average for e-cigarette use stands at 5.4%, a figure alarmingly close to the prevalence of conventional cigarette use, which is 6%.

In response to this situation, countries in the Americas have made progress in implementing effective measures to reduce tobacco use and counter the strategies employed by the tobacco industry. Ten Member States have adopted comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, some of which also cover emerging products such as electronic cigarettes. In addition, seven countries have completely banned the sale of these products.

As a result of these efforts and the implementation of measures outlined in the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), it is estimated that the number of tobacco users in the Region has declined from 159 million in the year 2000 to 129 million in 2025—an 18.87% reduction. This downward trend reflects the positive impact of regulations such as 100% smoke-free environments and graphic health warnings on tobacco packaging, as well as growing awareness of the harmful effects of tobacco on health, the economy, and the environment.

World No Tobacco Day was created by WHO Member States in 1987 and is observed annually on May 31 to raise awareness about the harmful effects of tobacco use. This year's campaign aims to expose industry strategies that manipulate the appearance and appeal of tobacco and nicotine products. By unmasking these tactics, the initiative seeks to raise awareness, promote policy change, and reduce demand, especially among youth.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study could change the definition of wound closure in diabetes care","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250531/Study-could-change-the-definition-of-wound-closure-in-diabetes-care.aspx","Sat, 31 May 2025 04:47:00 GMT","

In patients with diabetic foot ulcers that looked healed and met the current definition of a closed wound, closed ulcers with functionally defective skin that lost more body water were likely to re-open, according to a new National Institutes of Health (NIH) Diabetic Foot Consortium study, led by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and published today in Diabetes Care.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently defines a closed wound as one where the surface is completely covered by new skin and has not had any discharge or drainage for two consecutive weeks.

But when it comes to wound healing, looks can be deceiving.

A wound that meets the FDA's criteria of wound closure appears to be healed, but it may not be functionally closed. The skin may not be doing its job of providing a barrier to the outside world: The covering is there, but the covering doesn't work, so it's vulnerable to bacteria, dirt and allergens entering the body. We call these invisible wounds.""

Chandan Sen, Ph.D., co-lead author, professor in the Department of Surgery at Pitt, director of the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine and chief scientific officer of Wound Healing Services at UPMC

However, invisible wounds have a telltale sign: more moisture evaporates through this compromised barrier compared with healthy skin. This can be detected with a simple handheld point-of-care device that measures trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL).

""Diabetic foot ulcers are a major complication among patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. These wounds heal slowly and have high rates of recurrence, which often leads to amputation and death,"" said Sen. ""Our research shows that high TEWL of closed wounds, marking defective barrier function of the skin, is followed by wound recurrence.""

The new findings suggest that restoration of skin barrier functionality should be incorporated into the existing definition of wound closure to ensure durable wound closure and to better identify patients at risk of wound recurrence.

Across seven U.S. study sites of the NIH Diabetic Foot Consortium, the researchers - led by Sen, Gayle Gordillo, M.D., and Sashwati Roy, Ph.D., M.S. - recruited 418 adult participants with type 1 or 2 diabetes and who had a recently healed diabetic foot ulcer. Using a handheld device, they collected baseline TEWL measurements from the closed wound sites and then followed these patients for up to 16 weeks to check for wound recurrence.

Of the 368 participants who completed the study, 79, or 22%, had wounds that reopened by week 16. Baseline TEWL values were higher for wounds that would go on to reopen than for those that remained closed.

Further analysis identified that patients with high TEWL values - greater than 30 - were about 2.7 times more likely to have the wound reopen compared to those with lower TEWL levels. Time to recurrence was also shorter in wounds with high TEWL.

""Our study suggests that a TEWL of 30 in a healed wound should be considered a red flag for recurrence,"" said Gordillo, professor of plastic surgery at Pitt and senior medical director of UPMC Wound Healing Services. ""Even though these wounds may look closed, the barrier is defective, so these invisible wounds deserve further care.""

According to Sen, measuring TEWL as part of standard practice for assessing wound closure could lead to better outcomes for patients with diabetic foot ulcers and other types of wounds.

""This study is an important initial step to give clinicians treating diabetic foot ulcers a reliable diagnostic aid for the first time to assess an individual's risk of ulcer recurrence,"" said Teresa Jones, M.D. program director for the Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology, & Metabolic Diseases at NIH's National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). ""Foot ulcers are such a confounding issue with diabetes and being able to determine which wounds are at highest risk for recurrence could save many lives and limbs."" 

Additional research is needed to assess the impact of interventions for treatment of healed wounds with high TEWL.

Other authors on the study were Shomita Steiner, Ph.D., of Pitt; Jordan Jahnke, M.S., Giselle Kolenic, M.A., Cathie Spino, Sc.D., and Crystal Holmes, D.P.M., all of the University of Michigan; Mithun Sinha, Ph.D., and Lava Timsina, M.P.H., Ph.D., of Indiana University; Michael Conte, M.D., of the University of California, San Francisco; Teresa Jones, M.D., of NIH's NIDDK; Rodica Pop-Busui, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of Michigan and Oregon Health and Science University; and Geoffrey Gurtner, M.D., University of Arizona and Stanford University.

This research was funded by NIH/NIDDK grants (U01DK119099, U24DK122927, U01DK119100, U01DK119083, U01DK119094, U01DK119085 and U01DK119102).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Men with common genetic variant twice as likely to develop dementia","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250531/Men-with-common-genetic-variant-twice-as-likely-to-develop-dementia.aspx","Sat, 31 May 2025 04:41:00 GMT","

New research has found that men who carry a common genetic variant are twice as likely to develop dementia in their lifetime compared to women.

The research, published in Neurology, used data from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial to investigate whether people who had variants in the haemochromatosis (HFE) gene, which is critical for regulating iron levels in the body, might be at increased risk of dementia.

Co-author Professor John Olynyk, from the Curtin Medical School, said one in three people carry one copy of the variant, known as H63D, while one in 36 carry two copies.

Having just one copy of this gene variant does not impact someone's health or increase their risk of dementia. However, having two copies of the variant more than doubled the risk of dementia in men, but not women.

While the genetic variant itself cannot be changed, the brain pathways which it affects – leading to the damage that causes dementia – could potentially be treated if we understood more about it.""

Professor John Olynyk, Curtin Medical School

Professor Olynyk said further research was needed to investigate why this genetic variant increased the risk of dementia for males but not females.

""The HFE gene is routinely tested for in most Western countries including Australia when assessing people for haemochromatosis – a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron. Our findings suggest that perhaps this testing could be offered to men more broadly,"" Professor Olynyk said.

""While the HFE gene is critical for controlling iron levels in the body, we found no direct link between iron levels in the blood and increased dementia risk in affected men.

""This points to other mechanisms at play, possibly involving the increased risk of brain injury from inflammation and cell damage in the body.""

Co-author Professor Paul Lacaze, from Monash University, said the findings could help improve outcomes for people at risk of developing dementia.

""More than 400,000 Australians are currently living with dementia, with around a third of those being men. Understanding why men with the double H63D variant are at higher risk could pave the way for more personalised approaches to prevention and treatment,"" Professor Lacaze said.

""This study is a great example of how diverse Australian research groups and universities can collaborate effectively to learn more about these progressive diseases and ultimately improve health outcomes for people around the world.""

The ASPREE trial was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of daily low-aspirin in 19,114 healthy older people in Australia and the USA. Primarily undertaken to evaluate the risks versus benefits of daily low-dose aspirin in this cohort, it created a treasure trove of healthy ageing data that has underpinned a wealth of research studies.

The research was a collaboration between Curtin University, Monash University, The University of Melbourne, The Royal Children's Hospital, Murdoch Children's Research Institute and Fiona Stanley Hospital.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Light-powered phagocytic macrophage microrobot combines immune functions with robotic controllability","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250531/Light-powered-phagocytic-macrophage-microrobot-combines-immune-functions-with-robotic-controllability.aspx","Sat, 31 May 2025 06:43:00 GMT","

Macrophages and other immune cells are the natural frontline immune warriors of our body, defending the body against invading pathogens and cancer cells. Yet despite their innate ""combat"" capabilities, precisely directing and activating these cells in vivo has remained challenging. In recent years, the emergence of bio-microrobots has shown great potential to convert these ""natural soldiers"" into controllable function units using external physical fields and biomimetic design. However, existing approaches typically rely on magnetic, acoustic or optical fields to drive cell movement, but hard to tuning their biological functions. Besides, these methods require exogenous material or genetic modification, raising serious biosafety and immune-rejection concerns.

In a new paper published in Light: Science & Applications, a team of scientists led by Professor Hongbao Xin from Jinan University, China, has developed a light-powered phagocytic macrophage microrobot (""Phagobot"") that combines innate immune functions with robotic controllability. The phagobot can be ""woken up"" and navigated simply using a tightly focused near-infrared (NIR) light beam.

""We wanted to find a way to control immune cells with the same precision as machines, but without taking away their natural strengths,"" said Professor Xin, the study's corresponding author. ""With this dual-mode optical control strategy, macrophages remain completely natural, yet they can be precisely instructed to move, seek, and phagocytosis of bio-threats both in vitro and in vivo.""

The process begins with a tightly focused NIR laser beam (1064 nm) focusing on the surface of resting macrophages. Within a few minutes, the localized photothermal effect triggers temperature-sensitive ion channels in the cell membrane, causing calcium to rush into the cell. This chain reaction activates the cell's energy metabolism and leads to a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is a hallmark of macrophage activation. As a result, the macrophage transforms, extending flexible ""arms"" called pseudopodia, ready for action.

It's like flipping a biological switch with light. The light doesn't just move the cell. It turns the cell into a warrior.""

Xing Li, the paper's first author and PhD student at Jinan University

The extended pseudopodia in activated macrophage can act like tiny antennae to sense changes in the extracellular microenvironment. Researchers used gentle optical forces to manipulate the pseudopodia, enabling precise directional control. In this way, the phagobot could be navigated toward target locations with high spatial accuracy. 

""Other bio-microrobots that rely on magnetic or acoustic fields to push entire cells, which may inevitably disturb cell activity and immune state. On contrast, this method works at the subcellular level, guiding only the pseudopodia. This keeps the rest of the cell undisturbed, mimicking how immune cells naturally migrate in tissue."" Said the co-corresponding author, Associate Professor Ting Pan.

In laboratory tests, the phagobot showed remarkable efficiency in targeting and engulfing a variety of bio-threats, including Staphylococcus aureus, yeast cells, plastic nanoparticles, and tumor cell debris. The system also proved its power in vivo. Using zebrafish models, researchers labeled macrophages with fluorescent markers and successfully activated and navigated them in the complex, constantly moving gut environment. There, the phagobots located and cleared cellular debris without causing any visible tissue damage even after prolonged light exposure.

""This approach overcomes the two major bottlenecks in the field of bio-microrobots: external driving systems can only drive the cells to move and the need for synthetic or genetic modifications. It provides a non-genetic platform for in vivo immune intervention, offering promising applications in targeted therapy and precision immunomodulation,"" these scientists summarized.

Prevailing theories about why young people experience psychotic breaks at a young age rely on individual factors like exposure to child abuse, school bullying, or drugs.

But a new study from the NYU Silver School of Social Work suggests that broader social factors, such as racial inequality and experience with police violence, might contribute to the proportionately higher rates of psychosis seen among low-income young adults of color.

The study, ""Social Defeat and Psychosis in the United States,"" was published today by Schizophrenia Bulletin and authored by NYU Silver associate professor Jordan DeVylder and doctoral students Jacqueline Cosse and Brianna Amos.

The researchers culled the National Survey of Poly-Victimization and Mental Health to explore individual-level and societal, or structural, impacts on early psychosis risk. The sample included 1,584 U.S. participants aged 18-29.

Among the respondents, Blacks, Latinos, multiracial, and Indigenous respondents had 60% higher odds of reporting having experienced one or more psychotic episodes in the prior year compared to white respondents, the study determined.

Furthermore, those who cited an experience involving police violence in had 52% higher odds of reporting one or more delusional or hallucinatory episode in the prior year.

The most widely recognized risk factors for psychosis are spelled out in the ""Social Defeat Hypothesis,"" an influential theoretical framework used by psychiatrists to treat young adults with psychosis. While the social defeat hypothesis frames risk factors around the impact on the individual, the study shifts the focus to take in account social systems and structural factors.

In the study's analysis of the U.S. survey, an individual's sense of ""social defeat"" can indeed result in psychotic symptoms and can arise from a high frequency of substance use or exposure to bullying, as the theory holds. But the persistence of racial inequality, and related experiences such as exposure to police violence, could also be relevant factors, according to the study. It calls for research into the impact of societal factors that are more prominent in low-income and marginalized communities.

Developed in Northern Europe, the ""Social Defeat Hypothesis"" has been used by U.S. psychiatrists for over two decades to understand the development of psychosis, a condition that could show a young adult to be at higher risk of suicidal thinking or even schizophrenia.

Under the hypothesis, social defeats, like feeling humiliated, contribute to long-term neurobiological shifts in the brain and dopamine system especially, and are part of what may bring on instances in which an individual loses touch with reality. 

In conducting the study, DeVylder, Cosse, and Amos collaborated extensively with fellow social work scholar Lisa Fedina of the University of Michigan, as well as additional NYU Silver doctoral students.

Commenting on findings' significance, DeVylder said that structural factors may exert a ""substantial"" influence on an individual risk for psychosis, and could potentially help explain ethno-racial disparities in psychosis in the U.S.

This potentially means that reducing exposure to systemic factors, like societal racism, may provide mental health benefits similar to individual-focused interventions, like psychotherapy.""

NIH-funded project shows that trans-epidermal water loss could indicate if wounds are fully healed.

A research team funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has identified a diagnostic aid that has the potential to accurately predict the recurrence of diabetic foot ulcers that appear to be fully healed. By measuring the skin's barrier function through a process known as trans-epidermal water loss, or TEWL, scientists were able to determine which wounds were more likely to reopen. TEWL measurements are a major factor in burn care, where deep layers of the skin are often damaged. The findings suggest that full restoration of skin barrier function should be incorporated into existing wound treatment standards to ensure complete wound closure and to better identify patients at risk of wound recurrence.

This study is an important initial step to give clinicians treating diabetic foot ulcers a reliable diagnostic aid for the first time to assess an individual's risk of ulcer recurrence. Foot ulcers are such a confounding issue with diabetes and being able to determine which wounds are at highest risk for recurrence could save many lives and limbs.""  

Teresa Jones, M.D. program director, Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology, & Metabolic Diseases, NIH's National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)

Scientists, working together through the NIDDK Diabetic Foot Consortium, evaluated over 400 study participants who had a diabetic foot ulcer that visually appeared to be closed or healed. They measured TEWL at the site of the foot ulcer and found that 35% of participants with high TEWL (more water loss) reported a wound recurrence by 16 weeks, compared to just 17% for those with low TEWL (less water loss). Participants with higher TEWL were 2.7 times more likely to experience a wound recurrence than participants with low TEWL.

Diabetic foot ulcers are a major complication of diabetes where a break in the skin of the foot is often unnoticed by a patient due to nerve damage, known as neuropathy. They are the leading cause of non-traumatic lower-limb amputations, and untreated or unhealed ulcers significantly increase the risk of death. Wounds that appear to be healed on the surface may not be fully closed below the superficial surface of the skin, hampering the effectiveness of the skin's barrier function to keep in water and keep out pathogens, such as bacteria.

Study results will publish in Diabetes Care, a journal of the American Diabetes Association. The study was funded by NIH/NIDDK grants (U01DK119099, U24DK122927, U01DK119100, U01DK119083, U01DK119094, U01DK119085 and U01DK119102) and carried out by members of NIH's Diabetic Foot Consortium.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","WHO releases first-ever position paper on immunization products to protect infants against RSV","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250530/WHO-releases-first-ever-position-paper-on-immunization-products-to-protect-infants-against-RSV.aspx","Sat, 31 May 2025 01:41:00 GMT","

Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) published its first-ever position paper on immunization products to protect infants against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) – the leading cause of acute lower respiratory infections in children globally.

Every year, RSV causes about 100 000 deaths and over 3.6 million hospitalizations in children under the age of 5 years worldwide. About half of these deaths occur in infants younger than 6 months of age. The vast majority (97%) of RSV deaths in infants occur in low- and middle-income countries where there is limited access to supportive medical care, such as oxygen or hydration.

Published in the Weekly Epidemiological Record (WER), the position paper outlines WHO recommendations for two immunization products: a maternal vaccine that can be given to pregnant women in their third trimester to protect their infant and a long-acting monoclonal antibody that can be administered to infants from birth, just before or during the RSV season.

RSV is an incredibly infectious virus that infects people of all ages, but is especially harmful to infants, particularly those born premature, when they are most vulnerable to severe disease. The WHO-recommended RSV immunization products can transform the fight against severe RSV disease, dramatically reduce hospitalizations, and deaths, ultimately saving many infant lives globally.""

Dr. Kate O'Brien, Director of Immunization, Vaccines, and Biologicals at WHO

RSV usually causes mild symptoms similar to the common cold, including runny nose, cough and fever. However, it can lead to serious complications – including pneumonia and bronchiolitis – in infants, young children, older adults and those with compromised immune systems or underlying health conditions.

In response to the global burden of severe RSV disease among infants, WHO recommends that all countries introduce either the maternal vaccine, RSVpreF, or the monoclonal antibody, nirsevimab depending on the feasibility of implementation within each country's existing health system, cost-effectiveness and anticipated coverage. Both products were recommended by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) for global implementation in September 2024. In addition, the maternal vaccine received WHO prequalification in March 2025, allowing it to be purchased by UN agencies.

WHO recommends that the maternal vaccine be given to pregnant women during the third trimester of pregnancy, from week 28 onwards, to optimize for the adequate transfer of antibodies to their baby. The vaccine may be given during routine antenatal care, including at one of the 5 WHO-recommended antenatal care visits in the third trimester or any additional medical consultations.

The second WHO-recommended immunization product, nirsevimab, is given as a single injection of monoclonal antibodies that starts protecting babies against RSV within a week of administration and lasts for at least 5 months, which can cover the entire RSV season in countries with RSV seasonality.

WHO recommends that infants receive a single dose of nirsevimab right after birth or before being discharged from a birthing facility. If not administered at birth, the monoclonal antibody can be given during the baby's first health visit. If a country decides to administer the product only during the RSV season rather than year-round, a single dose can also be given to older infants just before entering their first RSV season.

The greatest impact on severe RSV disease will be achieved by administering the monoclonal antibody to infants under 6 months of age. However, there is still a potential benefit among infants up to 12 months of age.

WHO regularly issues updated position papers on vaccines, combinations of vaccines and other immunization products against diseases that have major public health impact. These papers focus primarily on the use of vaccines in large-scale vaccination programmes. The new position paper aims to inform national public health policymakers and immunization programme managers on the use of RSV immunization products in their national programmes, as well as national and international funding agencies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Cross-cultural analysis reveals differences in socio-cognitive abilities of autistic and non-autistic adults","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250530/Cross-cultural-analysis-reveals-differences-in-socio-cognitive-abilities-of-autistic-and-non-autistic-adults.aspx","Sat, 31 May 2025 02:56:00 GMT","

Emerging theories suggest that communication challenges arise from differing perspectives between autistic and non-autistic partners rather than individual socio-cognitive deficits. In addition, while social behavior varies between cultures, observations from Western cultures dominate our understanding of autism. Researchers from Japan and the UK have conducted a cross-cultural analysis comparing the mentalizing performance of British and Japanese autistic and non-autistic adults. Their study highlights the need for more culturally sensitive socio-cognitive measures to assess autistic traits.

Autism spectrum disorders are associated with difficulties in social communication, long attributed to individual socio-cognitive deficits. As a consequence of this perspective, stigma and pressure to conform to neurotypical social norms often lead to mental health challenges among autistic individuals. Emerging theories suggest that communication difficulties may rather arise from mismatches in perspectives between autistic and non-autistic partners. Addressing this mismatch collaboratively could transform the understanding of autism and improve communication outcomes.

Social behavior also varies significantly across cultures. Gestures, eye contact, and body language that are considered appropriate in one culture may be perceived differently in another. Nevertheless, current socio-cognitive assessments largely reflect Western norms, limiting their applicability to non-Western populations.

To bridge this gap, researchers from Japan conducted a cross-cultural analysis to compare mentalizing difficulties, or challenges in understanding the thoughts and feelings of others, in British and Japanese autistic and non-autistic adults. Led by Dr. Bianca Schuster, a researcher at Waseda University, Japan, with co-authors Associate Professor Yuko Okamoto and Professor Rieko Osu from Waseda University, Professor Hirotaka Kosaka from the University of Fukui, and Dr. Masakazu Ide from the National Rehabilitation Center for Persons With Disabilities, the study highlights the importance of considering neurodivergent perspectives rather than attributing difficulties solely to autistic individuals.

Explaining the rationale behind their work, Dr. Schuster says, ""Autistic and non-autistic people have different experiences and therefore perceive and interact with the world differently. Such a mismatch in perspectives can lead to difficulties in understanding each other's respective social cues – a problem termed the 'double empathy problem.' This theory has received a lot of attention in recent years, but there are still very few studies that have formally tested it."" Their findings were published in Volume 16 of Molecular Autism on May 14, 2025.

The researchers used animations showing social scenes, depicted by moving triangles, and asked participants to interpret what was happening. They found that non-autistic British adults struggled to interpret animations created by their autistic peers. In contrast, British autistic adults demonstrated similar performances when interpreting animations made by both autistic and non-autistic people. The fact that British autistic adults did not perform better with animations made by their own neurotype may reflect that, in comparison to neurotypical groups, the perspectives of British neurodivergent individuals may be too varied.

Conversely, Japanese autistic and non-autistic adults interpreted animations created by their own and the respective other group with comparable accuracy. Notably, cross-cultural analyses revealed that while there was no difference in performance between Japanese and British non-autistic adults, Japanese autistic participants outperformed both groups of British participants. In addition, animations created by Japanese autistic adults were interpreted with higher accuracy by all autistic participants. Nevertheless, motor performance was comparable across all participants.

Overall, these findings support a paradigm shift toward treating autism as a different way of experiencing and interpreting the world, while recognizing it as a social disability shaped by challenges within a predominantly neurotypical environment. An inclusive environment that values socially diverse behaviors can support autistic individuals and enhance their mental well-being. Furthermore, the observed results do not likely mean that Japanese people are better at mentalizing than British individuals, because real-world difficulties in communication and social understanding do exist between autistic and non-autistic people in Japan, too. Instead, the findings may indicate that the task used in the current study may not be sensitive enough to detect mentalizing differences in the Japanese culture, highlighting the need to develop more culturally sensitive research and diagnostic tools.

""Cultural differences related to the diagnosis of autism may be subtle but can still lead to misclassification of cases and therefore have a significant impact on the lives of individuals. The results of this study highlight the urgent need for culturally inclusive research and the development of diagnostic criteria and tools that accurately reflect and respect the diverse manifestations of autism in different cultural contexts."" Dr. Schuster adds.

Researchers at the Ragon Institute have made a significant discovery about how antibodies can directly enhance the body's ability to fight Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis (TB). Despite decades of research, TB remains one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide, with about 10 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths annually. Currently, there is no highly effective vaccine, highlighting the urgent need for new insights and treatments.

In a study published today in Immunity, Ragon faculty member Galit Alter, PhD and previous post-doctoral trainee Patricia Grace, PhD, now at University of Pittsburgh, partnered with Bryan Bryson, PhD, associate member Sarah Fortune, PhD and a team of collaborators, to collect the largest library of monoclonal antibodies to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) the bacteria that causes Tuberculosis. The team identified specific antibody features that significantly limit the growth of Mtb. This research reveals critical new insights into how antibodies interact with immune cells in the lungs to restrict Mtb infection, laying the groundwork for potential antibody-based therapies or vaccines against tuberculosis, both of which are urgently needed.

The team investigated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), highly specialized antibodies engineered to target specific components of Mtb. They screened a broad library of these antibodies, targeting many different components of the bacteria, to determine which could effectively reduce bacterial growth in infected mice. They found that particular antibodies targeting different parts of the bacteria-both surface proteins and internal antigens-could effectively restrict Mtb growth, challenging previous assumptions that only antibodies recognizing surface structures could help fight TB.

To better understand the mechanisms behind this antibody-mediated protection, researchers closely examined one particularly effective antibody targeting a molecule called lipoarabinomannan (LAM), found on the bacterial cell surface. By engineering the antibody constant domain (Fc), to control the killing activities of the antibody, the researchers discovered that maximal bacterial control was achieved when antibodies redirected innate immune cell recruitment and activation. Particularly, antibodies able to redirect the bacteria to neutrophils provided the greatest level of protection.

This discovery highlights a previously unrecognized way antibodies can work against TB not merely by neutralizing pathogens directly, but by reshaping immune cell functions within infected tissues. Given the rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria, understanding these immune mechanisms opens new avenues for novel therapeutic and vaccine design that are urgently needed to combat TB. Moreover, this study unlocks future approaches to rapidly discover and design monoclonal therapeutics to a broader array of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the future.

This study investigates upper gastrointestinal tract (UGIT) involvement in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), a condition traditionally considered limited to the colon. Although extra-colonic manifestations of UC are well recognized, UGIT issues have received less attention. This research aimed to document the clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological UGIT findings in adults with UC and assess their association with disease severity and extent.

This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at Ain Shams University over one year. A total of 78 UC patients underwent comprehensive clinical evaluations, including assessments of gastrointestinal complaints, medication history, disease progression, surgeries, and physical examinations. Endoscopic assessments of both the UGIT and colon were performed, accompanied by biopsies for histopathological analysis.

The study population had a mean age of 35.26 years, with a nearly equal gender distribution. Endoscopic findings revealed significant UGIT involvement: 64% of patients had esophagitis and/or gastroesophageal reflux disease, 93% had gastritis, and 80% had duodenitis. Histopathological findings showed notable inflammation, basal cell hyperplasia, and ulcerations in the esophagus, with 51.3% of patients exhibiting chronic gastritis and 38.5% testing positive for Helicobacter pylori infection. Statistical analysis demonstrated a strong association between colonic disease severity and UGIT endoscopic (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.001 in the esophagus and stomach, respectively) and histopathological (p < 0.004, p < 0.001, and p <0.005 in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, respectively) findings, particularly in patients with UGIT symptoms.

The current study concluded that endoscopic and histopathological changes in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenal mucosa are common in Egyptian UC patients. The study has established an association between UC and the endoscopic and histopathological findings in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. We recommend conducting a UGIT endoscopy examination for UC patients to diagnose any present UGIT lesions. The results of this study provide a rationale for conducting multicenter controlled studies with a larger number of Egyptian UC patients to confirm these findings.

Gene expression leading to alterations in the DNA caused by asbestos exposure may explain the development of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM), a rare and aggressive cancer. By analyzing public RNA-seq data through a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline, scientists working with the Sbarro Health Research Organization (SHRO) have developed an in-depth view of the molecular mechanisms involved in asbestos-induced carcinogenesis. The findings highlight both known and novel genes and pathways, providing valuable insights into the biological processes disrupted in exposed patients. This work contributes to ongoing efforts to define reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and lays the groundwork for future investigations and potential clinical applications in personalized approaches to MPM management.

The article, titled ""From Asbestos Exposure to Carcinogenesis: Transcriptomic Signatures in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma,"" describes a new study investigating differential gene expression in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) associated with documented asbestos exposure, with the aim of identifying specific transcriptomic biomarkers that could support advances in precision medicine.

Published in Experimental and Molecular Pathology, the paper was a collaborative effort between teams led by Professor Antonio Giordano, M.D., Ph.D., Founder and Director of the SHRO and Professor at Temple University, and Professor Elisa Frullanti, Ph.D., Director of the Cancer Genomics & Systems Biology Lab and Professor of Genetics at the University of Siena. The study was conducted within the Med Biotech Hub and Competence Center at the University of Siena, in collaboration with the SHRO and the Sbarro Institute for Molecular Medicine and Cancer Research at Temple University. Funding was provided by the Italian National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work (INAIL) through the BRiC-INAIL 2022 program. Co-authors include Diletta Rosati, Bianca Giulia Maurizi, Viola Bianca Serio, Debora Maffeo, Angela Rina, Francesca Mari, and Maria Palmieri.

Using publicly available RNA sequencing datasets, the research team employed a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline to perform differential gene expression and functional enrichment analyses. The results identified a distinct set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in MPM patients with documented asbestos exposure. Many of these genes are involved in key biological processes such as ion homeostasis, oxidative stress response, and cellular component disorganization-hallmarks of asbestos-induced cellular damage that may play a role in tumor initiation and progression.

This is not just about cataloging genes. It's about constructing a molecular roadmap of asbestos-induced cancer development. With further validation, this could translate into real-world clinical applications.""

Professor Elisa Frullanti, Ph.D., Director of the Cancer Genomics & Systems Biology Lab and Professor of Genetics at the University of Siena

The findings shed new light on the molecular mechanisms of MPM and offer a foundation for future research into predictive and prognostic biomarkers. By pinpointing specific transcriptomic changes, the study contributes to efforts in precision medicine and supports the development of improved diagnostic tools and potential therapeutic targets for this deadly disease.

""This type of precision medicine means that we are one step closer to identifying patients more likely to develop Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma,"" says Giordano, ""and we are closer to developing potential treatments.""

As the global incidence of mesothelioma continues to rise-due in part to the long latency period of asbestos exposure and ongoing environmental risks-this study represents a critical step toward more personalized and effective management strategies for patients.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New studies offer hope for easing primary care doctor burnout","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250531/New-studies-offer-hope-for-easing-primary-care-doctor-burnout.aspx","Sat, 31 May 2025 06:16:00 GMT","

America's primary care doctors are burning out, cutting back their hours, and leaving their practices early, driven in part by the demands of handling the flood of digital messages from their patients.

But a trio of new University of Michigan studies offer hope for easing this crisis, and improving both the care that patients get and the work lives of those who provide it. The studies could help primary care clinics nationwide take steps to keep the bedrock of American health care from crumbling further.

All three papers, published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, stemmed from efforts to understand and address the concerns of primary care providers at Michigan Medicine, U-M's academic medical center.

They each center around the issue of digital messages sent by patients through their digital portals, and how clinics handle their responses within the electronic health record.

Such messages went from a trickle to a deluge five years ago with the COVID-19 pandemic, and while the flood has ebbed a bit, they now form both a key part of care and a major driver of burnout.

All the authors are from the Division of General Medicine in the Department of Internal Medicine at U-M Health, which runs multiple primary care clinics across southeast Michigan for adults and mixed populations of children and adults. The division has undertaken a major clinical practice redesign in recent years.

Women make up more than half – 57% -- of the physicians in U-M's General Medicine and Internal Medicine-Pediatrics (also called Med-Peds) clinics. That's even higher than the national average for all primary care disciplines, in which prior research has shown female physicians are especially prone to burnout and its impacts on their career decisions.

That's why Greta Branford, M.D., and her colleagues decided to look at data from a year's worth of patient portal messages handled by U-M primary care physicians, and survey data.

They found many areas where male and female physicians were similar – including the fact that both groups spent just under an hour every day handling patient messages. But they also found key areas of difference. 

Women physicians were 60% more likely than their male counterparts to say that portal messages required more clinical assessment and 76% more likely to say that messages contributed to burnout. Women physicians also spent more time than male physicians on inputting orders related to patient messages per day, and writing notes documenting their clinical decisions.

Women physicians were also 60% more likely than male physicians to receive messages from patients that were negative or demeaning.

At the same time, women physicians were twice as likely as men to see the electronic health record system as easy to learn and an asset for patient education, and less likely than men to see the EHR as inhibiting quality care.

Exploring the differences in how male and female providers experience and manage portal messages reveals intriguing insights. While some institutions report a higher message volume for female providers, our institution observed that women tend to spend more time managing these messages. Compared to their male counterparts, women find the EHR system easier to learn and more beneficial in clinical practice. However, they are more likely to cite the in-basket workload as a source of burnout. Recognizing these gender differences can help us develop tailored solutions to address these challenges"".

Greta Branford, M.D., University of Michigan

One of the key drivers of burnout related to patient messages is ""pajama time"" – that is, the time that doctors spend handling messages outside of their normal work hours, often at home late into the night or early in the morning.

That's why Jennifer Reilly Lukela, M.D. and colleagues studied an innovation that U-M General Medicine clinics launched in 2022, to try to reduce the sense of overwhelm those providers felt from handling patient messages and other in-basket tasks.

The clinics gave physicians a 20-minute slot for every half day they saw patients, which they could use to handle patient questions, refill requests, test results or new symptoms for which a patient was requesting advice via a portal message.

Lukela and colleagues looked at how these slots, which the authors now refer to as Patient Asynchronous Care Effort or PACE slots, impacted clinical care delivery, billing, physician pajama time, and physician experiences, through surveys of more than 100 providers and analysis of activity in the EHR. 

In all, they found that the addition of these slots didn't diminish the total number of hours of ""pajama time"" physicians spent handling digital clinical duties outside their official hours. Nor did the clinics see a significant drop in patient visits, time spent with patients, or billable time measured in relative value units or RVUs.

What did change, Lukela says, is how physicians felt about their workload. Nearly all felt it helped them address urgent incoming messages in a timelier manner and to feel less overwhelmed by their inbaskets. Many commented that they were now less worried about missing an urgent issue or safety risk. And most (88%) perceived that the slots decreased their pajama time – when in fact overall there wasn't a measured drop.

""As we think about physician wellbeing and the sustainability of careers in primary care, one of the most critical things is agency over your day and control over your schedule,"" said Lukela. ""With the PACE innovation, we are both trying to meet patients where they're at and make primary care a sustainable practice for physicians by recognizing all the kinds of work they do, without reducing financial sustainability.""

Lukela serves as vice chair for clinical strategy and community engagement of the U-M Division of General Medicine. She notes that Michigan Medicine's Department of Family Medicine, as well as several other academic primary care groups across the nation, have also recently begun giving providers time to handle portal message-related demands.

""Asynchronous care is here to stay,"" she said. ""We need to figure out how to deliver this form of care efficiently and build it into the system, to prevent provider burnout, and ensure patient safety.""

Another recent paper by U-M General Medicine researchers shows the impact of an innovation that leverages the skills of the entire clinic team to make sure patient messages get handled appropriately. The new paper gives the results from a test conducted in one clinic, and compared with two others, before rolling it out broadly.

Led by Nicole Hadeed, M.D., the team interviewed all types of clinicians including medical assistants, patient service associates, licensed practical nurses, registered nurses, and physicians. They used this to develop standards and a routing guide for different kinds of patient portal messages, including communication among members of the clinic as they worked to handle a patient's message.

To look at what happened in the intervention clinic and compare it to the two other clinics, Hadeed and colleagues examined 343,000 messages related to 31,500 patients, including messages from patients and among staff.

This team-based approach aimed to spread the load across different types of clinicians, reduce redundant routing and unnecessary ""FYI"" messages, and ensure that patients reporting new symptoms receive a phone call to triage their issue.

At the clinic where they implemented the guides, there was a 16% reduction in messages per physician, and a 62% reduction in duplicate messages sent to multiple clinicians, compared with two other clinics that hadn't implemented the changes. There was also a 26% reduction in the messages sent directly to physicians at the intervention site, larger than the reduction at the control sites.

""While many clinician and staff reactions to the patient portal emphasize drowning under the brunt of clinical care happening over in-basket messages, it was evident that a significant proportion of messages are created by inefficient routing practices within the clinic itself, driven by a lack of transparency of each person's role within the multidisciplinary team,"" Hadeed said.

Through the evidence-driven guides, ""we were able to significantly reduce the volume of messages by simply outlining roles and routing guidance for common issues,"" she continued. ""Focusing on getting the right message to the right place the first time was a simple and powerful intervention to reduce intra-clinic message traffic that is budget-neutral and completely within the clinic site's control.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New app can help improve quality of life for caregivers of bone marrow transplant patients","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250530/New-app-can-help-improve-quality-of-life-for-caregivers-of-bone-marrow-transplant-patients.aspx","Sat, 31 May 2025 01:36:00 GMT","

A new study by investigators from Mass General Brigham showed that a new app they created can help improve the quality of life for caregivers of patients undergoing bone marrow transplant (BMT). The researchers conducted a randomized clinical trial and found that caregivers assigned to use the app showed significantly greater improvements in quality of life, burden, and mood symptoms compared to those who did not have the app. They detailed their findings in a presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting and a paper simultaneously published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

Family and friends who care for patients getting a bone marrow transplant struggle with depression and anxiety at high rates. Their heavy caregiving burden often leads to lower quality of life. The challenges of caregiving can significantly disrupt their employment, role in the household, and personal lives. This app is designed to help address their needs.""

Jamie Jacobs, PhD, co-principal investigator of the study, program director of Psychiatric Oncology and director of Caregiving Research at the Cancer Outcomes Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital

Jacobs co-developed the app with Areej El-Jawahri, MD, co-director of the Cancer Outcomes Research and Education Program and director of the Bone Marrow Transplant Survivorship Program at MGH. Together, they created a one-on-one supportive counseling program called BMT-CARE, which they had previously shown can increase caregiver quality of life. But to better scale the strategy, they created a virtual version of the therapy as an app called the BMT-CARE App.

The app offers educational modules, games, and videos grounded in evidence-based psychological techniques that support the caregiver through each stage of the process - before, during, and after the transplant. The trial testing of the app included 125 caregivers, half of whom received the app in addition to the usual supportive care services. The caregivers spent a median of 146.9 minutes using the app. Compared to those who received only standard services, the group using the app had a higher quality of life, lower caregiving burden, and fewer symptoms of depression and PTSD at 60 days after transplant.

""The BMT-CARE App may be an accessible option for much-needed support for overwhelmed caregivers who don't have the time, money or energy to access mental health services,"" said Jacobs.

The researchers are expanding the testing of the BMT-CARE App across multiple centers and with diverse caregiver populations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Researchers report surge in at-home heart attacks and cardiac deaths since COVID pandemic","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250530/Researchers-report-surge-in-at-home-heart-attacks-and-cardiac-deaths-since-COVID-pandemic.aspx","Sat, 31 May 2025 02:38:00 GMT","

Heart attacks are the leading cause of death globally, yet some statistics from many different countries suggest these events declined in frequency since the COVID-19 pandemic. Mass General Brigham researchers evaluated whether these cardiac trends reflect a true change in event rates, or if they reflect that more people are dying at home rather than in hospitals. Their findings highlight potential shortcomings of cardiac care during and in the years following the height of the pandemic, suggesting opportunities to better treat and prevent cardiac events in people at risk. The study published today in JAMA Network Open. 

Lots of reports have shown that there have been fewer heart attacks in hospitals since 2020-but something seems to be missing from that data. We now show that if you account for deaths at home, cardiac deaths are going up and have stayed up for years. Today there are a lot more people having cardiac deaths at home, which also raises the concern that people with heart disease haven't been getting the care they need since the pandemic.""

Jason H. Wasfy, MD, MPhil, corresponding author, director of Outcomes Research at the at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cardiology Division and faculty member at the Mongan Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital

The researchers looked at death certificate data from 127,746 people who died in Massachusetts and found cardiac deaths exceeded anticipated levels between 2020 and 2023. Using data from 2014 to 2019, the team set an expected cardiac death rate to compare the new 2020 to 2023 rate against. Cardiac deaths were 16% higher than expected in 2020, 17% higher in 2021 and 2022, and 6% higher in 2023. Notably, this significant increase in cardiac deaths happened despite lower cardiac-related hospital admissions, meaning more deaths occurred at home.

""Healthcare systems around the world have experienced multiple shocks since 2020. Our findings suggest that both patient choices about seeking care and outcomes after experiencing a cardiac emergency also have changed,"" said senior author John Hsu, MD, MBA, MSCE, faculty member and director of the Program for Clinical Economics and Policy Analysis at the Mongan Institute at MGH. ""Had we not examined mortality using death certificate data, the increases in population cardiac mortality could have gone unnoticed.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Microfluidic contact lenses emerge as next generation tools for eye care","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250531/Microfluidic-contact-lenses-emerge-as-next-generation-tools-for-eye-care.aspx","Sat, 31 May 2025 06:25:00 GMT","

The tear film coating the eye offers a window into a person's systemic and ocular health, carrying biomarkers such as glucose, electrolytes, and proteins. Yet, existing diagnostic approaches-like tonometry or tear sampling-are often invasive, infrequent, and impractical for daily monitoring. Likewise, standard eye drop treatments suffer from poor drug retention due to blinking and drainage, limiting their therapeutic impact. Smart contact lenses have emerged as a compelling alternative. By enabling real-time sensing and controlled drug release directly on the eye, they promise to revolutionize ophthalmic care. Still, incorporating delicate microfluidic features into the curved, flexible surface of soft lenses without compromising vision or comfort remains a formidable engineering challenge. Addressing these barriers calls for continued innovation in fabrication methods and material integration.

In a comprehensive review (DOI: 10.1038/s41378-025-00909-3) published April 3, 2025, in Microsystems & Nanoengineering, researchers from the Manipal Institute of Applied Physics and Manipal University Jaipur chart the evolution of Microfluidic contact lenses (MCLs) from concept to clinical possibility. The article examines how fabrication advances-spanning soft lithography, laser patterning, and 3D-printed mold replication-are enabling lenses to measure intraocular pressure, detect biochemical markers, and deliver medication on demand. With these capabilities, contact lenses are poised to become an all-in-one platform for diagnosis, therapy, and patient comfort.

The review highlights two core applications for MCLs: sensing and treatment. For diagnostics, deformable microchannels embedded in the lens respond to pressure changes by shifting indicator fluids, enabling accurate intraocular pressure measurements-crucial for glaucoma management. Some designs have achieved sensitivities up to 708 μm/mmHg, far surpassing earlier iterations. MCLs also track tear biomarkers such as pH, glucose, lactate, and proteins via smartphone-readable colorimetric or fluorescent sensors. On the therapeutic front, drug-loaded microchambers release medication in response to external cues like magnets or electrical signals-or internal ones like pH shifts or blinking pressure. These innovations allow for on-demand delivery while maintaining the optical clarity and flexibility of the lens. Fabrication methods underpin this progress: thermoforming and PDMS replication deliver precision; 3D printing allows for personalized designs; and femtosecond lasers offer ultra-fine microchannel engraving. Though scalable production remains a challenge, these technologies are steadily converging on practical, patient-ready solutions.

MCLs represent a convergence of vision care and advanced diagnostics. Our goal is to create a single, wearable device that seamlessly combines biosensing, therapeutic delivery, and user comfort. Many of these technologies are still in development, but the progress in fabrication and materials is encouraging. We're moving closer to clinical translation.""

Prof. Sajan D. George, the review's corresponding author

The future of MCLs extends far beyond the ophthalmologist's office. In healthcare, they offer transformative potential for managing chronic eye conditions like glaucoma and dry eye syndrome, while also treating diseases such as diabetic retinopathy through localized, sustained drug delivery. Paired with mobile interfaces, they enable remote diagnostics and personalized treatment. Outside medicine, the integration of sensors, drug systems, and even display technologies hints at applications in sports, military, and wearable tech. To fully realize these possibilities, further advancements in scalable manufacturing, regulatory compliance, and long-term safety will be key. But one thing is certain: smart lenses are rapidly transitioning from laboratory prototypes to real-world tools in precision health.

The U.S. women's national team is back in action as they prepare to face China and Jamaica in a pair of friendlies. The stars and stripes will kick off their summer calendar when they face China on Saturday at Allianz Field in Saint Paul, Minnesota. China and the USWNT will meet for the 61st time, and the USA holds the all-time series (38-9-13). The previous 60 meetings make China the second-most faced nation in USWNT history behind Canada. 

Head coach Emma Hayes has named a 24-player roster for the upcoming matches, with a balance of newcomers and veterans, as the staff continues to evaluate the player pool in the build-up to the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup.

Defender Naomi Girma returns to the squad for the first time in 2025, and forward Lynn Biyendolo returns following her appearance in the SheBelieves Cup in February. Lo'eau LaBonta, a 32-year-old NWSL midfielder and Attacking Third contributor, is participating in her first senior national team camp.

Angel City FC fullback Gisele Thompson departed national team camp due to a minor hip injury, U.S. Soccer announced on Thursday. The defender typically plays outside back for her club, and was previously in national team camps as a defender, but Hayes named Thompson as part of the forward core with aspirations to evaluate the player as a winger alongside her older sister Alyssa Thompson. 

Here are storylines, how you can watch the match and more:

The two countries have a long history with meetings in major tournaments, most notably the 1996 Olympic gold medal match and the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, where the USWNT were victorious. The two sides recently played in December 2023 during two matches to close out the calendar year. The USWNT won both meetings, defeating China 3-0 and 2-1. Goals were scored by Sophia Wilson, Lindsey Heaps, Trinity Rodman, Sam Coffey, and Jaedyn Shaw. 

Orlando Pride, and former Penn State alum, Kerry Abello is in her first national team camp following a standout year where she helped Orlando win the 2024 NWSL Shield and NWSL Championship and earned NWSL Second Best XI honors. She joins a list of 23 players who earned first time call-ups to the national team under Emma Hayes. 

""Honestly, my mentality is just to give it my best and try to soak in as much of it as I can, and kind of lead with curiosity and gratitude, just for being here. Rather than, you know, nervousness or fear or anything,"" Abello told Attacking Third on her approach to camps. 

""I've wanted this for so long, and I'm just excited to get this opportunity, and at the end of the day, I don't have any control over the decisions they make for the rosters for each camp, for the rosters for tournaments. So, I think it's a big relief in a way for me to just get the opportunity to give it my best shot, and then the decisions that are made after that are, are out of my hands. So, yeah, I'm kind of just coming into it blind in the best way. I'm just gonna give it my all every second and enjoy it.""

USWNT: Phallon Tulis-Joyce; Emily Fox, Tara McKeown, Emily Sonnett, Crystal Dunn; Sam Coffey, Lily Yohannes, Lindsey Heaps; Ally Sentnor, Catarina Macario, Alyssa Thompson

China: Xu Huan; Dou Jiaxing, Wu Haiyan, Linlin Wang,  Li Mengwen; Wang Yanwen, Liu Jing, Yao Wei, Zhang Xin; Jin Kun, Shao Ziqin 

Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign): During a roster announcement press conference, Hayes referenced Dickey's NWSL stats, ""the data don't lie,"" and the coach is correct. Among American goalkeepers active in NWSL through 10 games, Dickey leads in save percentage (74.3%), crosses claimed (11), and fewest goals against (nine). She's been part of national team camps, but has yet to make a debut, and that could change during this window.

The USWNT is coming off a split series against Brazil, a 2-0 win and a 2-1 loss, which Hayes has alluded to as another learning opportunity for the group. The next match provides that new chance for the USWNT against a national team program also building toward the next World Cup. 

China is coming off a pair of lopsided victories against Uzbekistan (5-0) and Thailand (5-1) in April. The wins followed a third place finish at the Pinatar Cup in February with very mixed results (1-1-1) against Canada, Chinese Taipei, and Mexico. Manager Ante Milicic is celebrating one year with the program and evaluating his ""modern playing style"" approach with the squad. 

It's two very different teams going head to head for the first time since 2023. New players and new coaches could either mean fireworks, or some periods of figuring things out before the goals breakthrough. Pick: USWNT 2, China 1

- USWNT roster welcomes back Naomi Girma and introduces veteran Lo'eau LaBonta to the squad

- Relive the USWNT vs. Brazil during the April international window

NWSL

In April, Trinity Rodman struck early for the U.S. Women's National Team against Brazil, with her first goal for the team since the 2024 Olympics. She received the ball from forward Alyssa Thompson and finished with a shot into the lower right corner of the net. It was her 11th goal for the national team.

While the crowd's cheers filled SoFi Stadium, they did not see what happened in the locker room at halftime.

Rodman's sweat-soaked, mud-streaked jersey was carefully collected by the team's equipment manager and placed in a sealed container bound for a warehouse in Amsterdam with eight other jerseys. These belonged to her teammates: Lindsey Heaps, Catarina Macario, Tara McKeown, Emily Fox, Allyson Sentnor, Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Crystal Dunn and Sam Coffey.

Almost three months later, on Saturday, the jersey was sold for $1,833 on MatchWornShirt.com, an online marketplace that auctions signed match-worn shirts from around the world. The Dutch company collaborates with over 300 soccer clubs and federations across 35 countries, and it has just signed a deal with both U.S. national teams.

During the USWNT's friendly against China in Minnesota on Saturday, the platform will launch its first live auction tied to a match. Every jersey worn will be up for grabs. The deal with U.S. Soccer and the USWNT Players Association also covers player-worn kits from all international tournaments moving forward, including the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, and the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil.



The idea of selling worn jerseys came to brothers and co-founders Bob and Tijmen Zonderwijk in 2016 while they were searching for a special gift for their father, a die-hard Ajax supporter, who was moving across the country for work. They wanted to get him a match-worn, signed jersey from one of his favorite players to hang in his new office. At the time, the only option was the annual club auction.

After a year trying to convince Dutch clubs of their new idea, one finally gave in: FC Twente, where Dutch captain Jill Roord recently signed.

“We pitched the idea there, and the guy was quiet for the entire hour. After that, he said, ‘Hey, it sounds like a win-win. When can we start?' So we were like, ‘s***, this is happening!'” Bob Zonderwijk told The Athletic.

In addition to a handful of USWNT and USMNT jerseys, the company's warehouse in Amsterdam is home to about 9,000 match-worn jerseys.

Historically, the locker room and those sweat-soaked jerseys are sacred for players. Most keep them. Some toss them to fans. Others trade them with opponents. Either way, they're prized. The Zonderwijk brothers, lifelong soccer fans, knew better than to mess with that.

“We don't want to interfere with those traditions,” Tijmen Zonderwijk said.

So they found a workaround: they collect only first-half jerseys. “Players are free to do whatever they want with the second-half kits — keep them, swap them, toss them into the stands,” he explains. Which means the Rodman jersey that just sold is certified and guaranteed to be the very shirt she scored in.

Operationally, every club is structured differently but MatchWornShirt's co-founders realized that to streamline their operations, they had to work with the most important person in the room: the kit managers. Last year, they hosted the first European conference of kit managers in Amsterdam, inviting 180 club representatives and 90 kit managers from partner clubs.

“The good thing about kitmen is that they are structured and reliable. They have their own protocols and once we become part of that protocol, we are all good,” Tijmen explained.

This is especially crucial when it comes to getting the jerseys cleaned. Or rather, not cleaned.

Instead of soap and water, the jerseys are treated with UVC light, a method that breaks down any lingering DNA to protect the player's health data but preserves the emotion: the grass stains, the wear and tear, even a trace of the smell.

“Eighty percent of the smell is reduced, but the smell is always there. It's also what makes it authentic,” Tijmen said. “If it smelled like flowers, then people might also question the authenticity.”

Once the jerseys are cleaned, the process of authentication starts: using match footage, they check how patches are printed to match them to the player wearing them. Then they chip the shirts with NFC (Near Field Communication) chips that carry a unique ID to certify their authenticity. NFC, commonly used for non-contact payments, uses close-range wireless technology to communicate between devises.

So far, the highest price paid for a women's match-worn shirt belongs to Sophia Smith's (now Wilson) No. 9 jersey that she wore while scoring in Portland Thorns' 2-0 NWSLchampionship win over Kansas City Current in 2022. It sold for $9,507 (£7,062). On the men's side, the most expensive jersey auctioned on the site was worn by Lionel Messi from his final season playing for Paris Saint-Germain. The winning bid was $58,000.

MatchWornShirt did not share how the money gets split between them and the clubs, as the company doesn't disclose specific contract terms. But each partnership is tailored to reflect the commercial and charitable priorities of the teams and organizations involved. In the case of the U.S. Soccer, the deal includes both the federation and the respective players' associations. That means the proceeds are shared, and players get a cut.

According to USWNT Players Association's agreement with the players, the PA receives payment from licenses like MatchWornShirt and players receive royalties. According to their financial statements from 2023, the organization paid its members $1,059,963 in royalties which amounts to 34.7 percent of the total revenue. The U.S. Women's National Team Players Association's (USWNTPA) Department of Labor report from 2024 shows that in 2023 former U.S. forward Alex Morgan took home the most in overall royalties ($167,593). Wilson ($74,232) and Rodman ($41,643) weren't far behind.

“With so many newcomers earning their first caps for the USWNT, these jerseys carry deep significance,” Annie Mitchell-Reid, the director of strategic partnerships and business at USWNTPA, told The Athletic. “Think of sisters Alyssa and Gisele Thompson making their debuts side by side, and others who will wear the stars and stripes for the first time or even the last time. There are so many amazing moments to come that fans can have a tangible piece of.”

But what happens if a jersey doesn't sell at one of MatchWorn's auctions? The Zonderwijks are not worried.

“We've never not sold a jersey,” Tijmen said with a grin.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","'I'm Here Now': Lo'eau LaBonta Reflects on First USWNT Camp, Being a Leader to Younger Players","https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2025/05/loeau-labonta-first-uswnt-camp-leader-lily-yohannes","Sat, 31 May 2025 12:56:34 GMT","

Lo'eau LaBonta may be in her first camp with the USWNT at 32 years old, but age is just a number.

Head coach Emma Hayes echoed that sentiment after calling LaBonta up for the two friendlies versus China PR (May 31 at 5:30 p.m. ET) and Jamaica (June 3 at 8 p.m. ET).

“She's trained really well this week, and she's fit really well into the group,” Hayes said. “She's got a great personality. Brings a lot of great energy to the locker room.”

Hayes has harped on developing the young pool of talent in the lead-up to larger tournaments like the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2027, but that doesn't mean sacrificing leadership. Hayes sees LaBonta as a great role model for players like 17-year-old Yohannes.

Midfielder Yohannes may be a teenager, but she's already got a year of USWNT experience on LaBonta. In June 2024, Yohannes earned her first cap — and her first goal — at Allianz Field in St. Paul, Minn. where LaBonta dons the red, white and blue for the first time. So, as Yohannes is learning tactically from a seasoned player like LaBonta, she's also sharing her breakfast combo and other valuable knowledge all first-timers need to know just as others taught her.

“[Veterans] have been here for so long, so they know how it is coming in as a first timer, and now that I've been in camp for a little while, I think I've grown my comfortability,” Yohannes said. “I'm just trying to continue to grow.”

Meanwhile, for LaBonta, it's a balance trying to learn as a newbie and being a leader for players like Yohannes and her Kansas City Current teammate Michelle Cooper.

“It's interesting because they have all the answers, right?” LaBonta said. “I think it's interesting to have to lean on [younger teammates]. ... It doesn't matter how old you are, how young you are, you can still ask people, you still learn.”

International soccer is a different style of play from what LaBonta is used to as captain at Current, the No. 1 NWSL squad. It's faster, and LaBonta is reveling in it, excited to take it back to her club.

“I would have loved to develop in this environment, but I'm here now and I'm enjoying it,” LaBonta said.

Yohannes, however, is developing in the international system. LaBonta eager to play with a rising talent, and calls herself a fan.

Still, Hayes preaches the long game when it comes to Yohannes, allowing the young player to develop into the international star that many see the potential of her becoming. That's where LaBonta and other leaders come in.

“[Yohannes] has got unbelievable maturity and coachability, and someone who I know is going to become an important part of our program,” Hayes said, “but I'm invested in that development, and we have to be patient with that.”

The U.S. women's national team is back in action Saturday, as the 2024 Paris Olympic champions host China in a friendly at Allianz Field in St. Paul, Minnesota.

The USWNT is in a transition phase, with head coach Emma Hayes evaluating how to operate without the team's world-class ""Triple Espresso"" front line. Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilson are both pregnant, while Trinity Rodman has not played in the NWSL since April 12 as she battles a persistent back injury.

While 20-year-old Angel City FC star Alyssa Thompson has emerged as an answer in the attack, the front line is not the only work in progress. Phallon Tullis-Joyce may be emerging as the lead candidate to replace longtime goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher (who retired from the USWNT in November), while star defender Naomi Girma is working her way back from a calf injury that has disrupted her start to life at Chelsea after a record-breaking transfer in January.

Here's what to know for the USWNT friendly against China, including time, how to watch, and the U.S. roster:

The USWNT vs. China friendly is scheduled to start at 5:30 p.m. ET on Saturday, May 31, with Allianz Field in St. Paul, Minnesota, hosting the first of two U.S. friendlies during this FIFA international break.

The game between the USWNT and China will air on TBS, while Universo will offer a Spanish-language broadcast. Fubo is offering a free trial for new subscribers looking to stream the game, while Max and Peacock will also carry full coverage.

Here are the 24 players (along with their clubs and total number of U.S. caps and goals) Emma Hayes called up for the USWNT's friendlies against China and Jamaica:

Olivier Giroud has won the World Cup and UEFA Champions League during his decorated career, yet even Los Angeles FC's famed French striker is impressed by the extraordinary nature of the stakes when his team hosts Club América on Saturday night.

The winner of this one-game play-in match gets the final spot in the FIFA Club World Cup and the remarkable chance for a North American team to face world soccer powers in the biggest-ever edition of this summer competition.

""To get the opportunity to play that kind of competition is a big chance for the boys,"" Giroud said. ""We need to grab the opportunity.""

What's more, the winning team at BMO Stadium will be guaranteed at least $9.55 million for its Club World Cup berth, along with a shot at nearly $100 million from the tournament's biggest-ever prize pool of nearly $1 billion.

Even the setting is tantalizing: Thanks to equal ticket distribution, LAFC's sold-out arena will be packed with raucous supporters of both the home team and the biggest professional club in Mexico. Los Angeles' passion for all forms of Mexican soccer is famously rabid, and América has legions of Southern California fans.

No wonder the players and coaches involved are expecting a career-defining experience in this big-money match.

""It's massive,"" LAFC center back Aaron Long said. ""I think the stakes are probably as high as it can get. Two titans of North America battling it out. I'm sure BMO will be on a different level. I'm sure fans from both sides are going to be going all-in, giving 100%. If you're a fan, these are the games you want to go and see. It's going to be incredible.""

The Club World Cup includes 32 teams for the first time, and it is being held across the U.S. one year before the FIFA World Cup returns to North America. Two Major League Soccer clubs and two Liga MX clubs have already qualified for the event, and LAFC or América will join them based on the results of this one match.

Giroud has done just about everything in world soccer - except this. Chelsea won the Champions League with Giroud in 2021 to earn a Club World Cup spot, but Giroud left for AC Milan before it happened.

""This is the kind of match you need to play at 110%,"" Giroud said. ""I've never played in it. It could be nice to meet Chelsea again, but obviously it will be a massive game (first).""

Indeed, the winner of the play-in match will face Chelsea, Brazil's Flamengo and Tunisia's ES Tunis in group play.

LAFC and América got this opportunity after FIFA disqualified León because of its rules against participation by multiple clubs owned by the same entity. León and fellow Liga MX qualifier Pachuca are owned by the same group, and León lost its appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport after attempting to change its ownership structure.

The decision was only finalized 3 1/2 weeks ago, necessitating this quick one-game playoff for the final spot.

The matchup will also serve as an informal referendum on the usually friendly competition between MLS and Liga MX for unofficial recognition as North America's top professional league. LAFC and América already met in a preseason friendly in Los Angeles this year, but the play-in is a different animal.

""I believe this game will be prepared like a final,"" said LAFC goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, another World Cup champion.

""It's going to be interesting to face one of the best Mexican clubs, and it's going to be tough, challenging, but it's also what you play football for,"" Lloris added. ""When I signed for LAFC, I didn't expect to have this type of opportunity. I know that in life and in football, when you have this kind of opportunity, you have to do everything to take it.""

LAFC has enjoyed steady success since its MLS debut in 2018, winning the MLS Cup playoff championship in 2022 and earning two Supporters' Shields for the best regular-season record. LAFC is unbeaten in eight matches since a CONCACAF Champions League qualifier loss to Club World Cup invitee Inter Miami last April.

América is generally considered both the most popular and the most decorated club in Mexico, and Las Águilas have been on top of Liga MX for much of the previous three seasons. Their Brazilian coach, André Jardine, attracted international praise while his team won three straight titles before losing the Clausura final to Toluca last Sunday night, falling just short of becoming only the second team in Mexico's history to win four consecutive championships.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

The Chelsea squad are already three days into a break of less than two weeks. This period, coming immediately after the Conference League final, may well represent half of their total summer holiday.

After the season extended onto Poland for the 4-1 win over Real Betis, there is not long for the squad to recharge its batteries before going again.  Chelsea will kick off their Club World Cup campaign in just over a fortnight in Atlanta. 

The competition carries lucrative benefits for those looking at the finances but great disruption for Enzo Maresca, the staff, and the players. With transfers to be done prior to the competition starting and a lack of pre-season to follow, it takes up an unusual spot in the calendar.

It is between two seasons and connects them in a way unlike any other club summer has before. With plenty of ins and outs to follow, how do Chelsea and Maresca manager the situation.

Well, football.london has had a go at picking a group to travel to America for the glorified tournament. With FIFA confirming that clubs can submit a final list of no fewer than 26 players but a maximum of 35 (including three goalkeepers), and no rules with homegrown players or Under-21s, here is how Chelsea could go. 

Robert Sanchez, Filip Jorgensen, Marcus Bettinelli, Djordje Petrovic, Mike Penders, Ted Curd

Chelsea have a lot of goalkeepers. It has not yet been ruled out that they might buy another this summer in a bid to find a proper first-choice. Robert Sanchez holds that position after Filip Jorgensen failed to truly push him close.

Djordje Petrovic, returning from RC Strasbourg, has a real chance to stake his claim if given a chance. He will be assessed by Chelsea over the summer. Mike Penders, also on this list, could get an early look in but is one for the future. The rest are academy options or coffee club leader and general smiley face around the place, Marcus Bettinelli. 

Reece James, Tosin Adarabioyo, Wesley Fofana, Trevoh Chalobah, Levi Colwill, Marc Cucurella, Josh Acheampong, Ishe Samuels-Smith, Benoit Badiashile, Malo Gusto, Mamadou Sarr, Aaron Anselmino

The centre-back spots are a point of great competition for Chelsea and another is being pursued. The current group is strong and mainly healthy, although Wesley Fofana's fitness and readiness is uncertain.

He might benefit from having another month off and may well need it. If he is out then Mamadou Sarr could be looked at closely having agreed to join from Strasbourg over the winter. Aaron Anselmino could also travel having spent the second half of the season at Cobham.

A loan for the pair may well follow in 2025/26 but for now they make up the numbers here. Ishe Samuels-Smith is expected to be promoted into Maresca's senior squad next season and is natural cover on the left. The teenager is yet to play for Chelsea as he wasn't eligible for the Conference League but would get valuable experience here.

Ben Chilwell and Axel Disasi are up for sale so it would make no sense for them to travel. Renato Veiga is not as certain to be finished at Chelsea yet but has been at Juventus for the past five months and does not appear to be in the immediate plans. 

Trevoh Chalobah may well be fighting for his future at Chelsea despite impressing since being recalled from Crystal Palace. It is a good chance to get some more minutes into Josh Acheampong's legs as well. Might it also be the last seen of Benoit Badiashile?

Change at the back promises to follow the Club World Cup but it would be a surprise to see too much difference when the squad is named.

Moises Caicedo, Enzo Fernandez, Andrey Santos, Dario Essugo, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Romeo Lavia, Kiano Dyer, Reggie Walsh

In midifled and Chelsea have already strengthened their squad. Dario Essugo and Andrey Santos will come in and have a point to prove. They will act as cover, support, and competition to Enzo Fernandez, Romeo Lavia, and Moises Caicedo.

The pair are to of the most exciting additions and should add genuine reinforcement. They could replace Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who was heavily linked with a January exit and will surely attract interest over the coming months. 

There are Cobham options to promote as well. Kiano Dyer and Reggie Walsh both played briefly in the Conference League and could be taken away for what would be great exposure. Dyer, though, has been included in the England Under-19s squad for the Euros later this summer. Sam Rak-Sakyi sees his contract expire at the end of June and is may leave. 

Chelsea could choose to have a look at Southampton loanee Lesley Ugochukwu in the USA, but he faces a battle with Essugo and Santos to get into Maresca's thinking. Carney Chukwuemeka is further away after struggling with fitness problems again whilst at Borussia Dortmund.

Omari Kellyman has been plagued with injury issues himself and is not yet in contention to play for the senior team. Mathis Amougou has hardly been involved since his January arrival. A loan will probably follow in the summer.

Liam Delap, Nicolas Jackson, Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, Pedro Neto, Tyrique George, Jadon Sancho, Marc Guiu, Shumaira Mheuka

If there is a deal which is completed during the early June 1-10 transfer window then Liam Delap is going to be that man. He is set to arrive from Ipswich Town for £30million. 

The hitch here is that he has England Under-21s commitments ahead of the European Championship next month. The overlap with the Club World Cup makes playing in both a challenge but not impossible. Chelsea have nothing to lose by naming him in the squad, especially with 35 spots open.

This list is most interesting for who doesn't make it. Joao Felix will return from loan at Milan but did not make it for Maresca prior to January so should not be reinstated here. Meanwhile, Armando Broja and David Datro Fofana must have their sights on finding new permanent homes and would be surprise inclusions. The same goes for Raheem Sterling.

Christopher Nkunku, unlike Felix, stayed at Stamford Bridge over the winter but his departure is on the cards. Chelsea and Nkunku are both happy to go their separate ways and he has not been playing even when fit recently. It makes little sense, therefore, to both taking him. 

Mykhailo Mudryk would be included if he was not suspended. The results of his B-sample are still being awaited after the winger tested positive for having a banned substance in his system at the end of 2024. 

Jadon Sancho can play for Chelsea in the group stage regardless of if his loan is extended into a permanent move from Manchester United for £25million. He will be in discussions with the club this week to decide what happens next but Sancho has been a happy figure for Chelsea and can easily be seen staying. 

Chelsea are planning to buy another winger this window as well but, like the centre-backs, nothing is as close as Delap. They may also consider signing a second No.9 too. At this stage it doesn't seem as if they would be in position before the Club World Cup.

Academy forward Shumaira Mheuka, like Walsh and Dyer, would benefit from being around the first team environment during this period. 

Robert Sanchez, Filip Jorgensen, Marcus Bettinelli, Djordje Petrovic, Mike Penders, Ted Curd, Reece James, Tosin Adarabioyo, Wesley Fofana, Trevoh Chalobah, Levi Colwill, Marc Cucurella, Josh Acheampong, Ishe Samuels-Smith, Benoit Badiashile, Malo Gusto, Mamadou Sarr, Aaron Anselmino, Moises Caicedo, Enzo Fernandez, Andrey Santos, Dario Essugo, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Romeo Lavia, Kiano Dyer, Reggie Walsh, Liam Delap, Nicolas Jackson, Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, Pedro Neto, Tyrique George, Jadon Sancho, Marc Guiu, Shumaira Mheuka.

Chelsea are UEFA Conference League champions. To celebrate, the club has launched a new merch collection including t-shirts, caps and more.

Cristiano Ronaldo's future at Al Nassr is up in the air after a disappointing season, and his contract is set to expire at the end of next month.

The 40-year-old also posted a cryptic message on his social media earlier this week, writing: “This chapter is over. The story? Still being written.”

With Al Nassr not involved in the tournament, there have long been suggestions that Ronaldo could compete at FIFA's inaugural expanded Club World Cup, which takes place in the United States this summer. And the body's president Gianni Infantino added fuel to the fire during an interview with YouTuber IShowSpeed last weekend.

Discussing Lionel Messi competing in the event with his MLS club Inter Miami, Infantino then added: “And Ronaldo might play for one of the teams as well at the Club World Cup. There are discussions with some clubs, so if any club is watching and is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup… who knows, who knows.”

A special transfer window opens for teams competing in the Club World Cup between June 1 and June 10, with sides able to add players before its opening game on June 14.

So, could a team move to sign Ronaldo between now and then? Are any of them interested? Is there a chance he could face eternal rival Messi, surely for the final time in their careers, at this tournament?

The Athletic's team of reporters approached figures at clubs competing at the Club World Cup to ask whether they would be interested in a move for Ronaldo. Unless otherwise noted, those people spoke under the condition of anonymity to protect relationships.

Their responses are below.

Chelsea turned down the opportunity to sign Ronaldo in 2022, and are not going to change their minds three years later.

The London club have already compiled a list of players they want to play up front for them in the future, including Hugo Ekitike, Liam Delap — who Chelsea have reached a transfer agreement for — and Benjamin Sesko. Like most of the Chelsea squad, these are players all under the age of 25 and have the best of their careers still to come. Their wage demands also fit into the general structure in place at Stamford Bridge.

Ronaldo, while respected for all his achievements, simply does not fit into the club's recruitment strategy.

Simon Johnson

No chance.

Juventus are still in arbitration with Ronaldo over an agreement that was made to defer some of his wages while he was with the Turin club during the Covid-19 pandemic. Last year, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) ordered Juventus to pay more than €9.7million ($10.35m, £8.3m), plus interest, to Ronaldo in back wages.

James Horncastle

As exciting as it could be, a Messi vs Ronaldo clash in the opening match of the 2025 Club World Cup is unlikely to happen.

Ronaldo joining Al Ahly, the Egyptian side who kick the tournament off against Messi's Inter Miami in that Florida city in two weeks' time, is a transfer that's only possible in video games. Financially, the move just isn't logical due to his salary requirements.

Ahmed Walid

Mamelodi Sundowns are South Africa's richest team, backed by one of the country's wealthiest men, Patrice Motsepe, who has been in charge since 2003. Since Motsepe became president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) in 2021, his son, Thlopie, has taken over as club chairman, running Sundowns on a day-to-day basis.

Advertisement

Thlopie confirmed last week that they are considering using the forthcoming transfer window but any new faces are only likely to arrive once their involvement in the Club World Cup is over. That responsibility will fall on Flemming Berg, the club's Danish sporting director, and his assistant, Ryan Hunt.

Simon Hughes

Palmeiras have not made any move, nor do they plan to do so, to sign Ronaldo. That has been the club's position since mid-May, when the first rumours surfaced that a team from Brazil was interested in the Portuguese forward. They also added they did not envision any Brazilian club being able to afford such a move.

The doubts about whether Ronaldo will stay in Saudi Arabia or not, with his current contract about to expire, have not changed the scenario at the Sao Paulo club.

Their attacking options will be young Estevao, a right-winger who will join Chelsea after this tournament; the Argentine Jose Manuel Lopez; or Vitor Roque, who failed to meet expectations at Spanish sides Barcelona and Real Betis over the past two seasons and did not score in his first nine games with Palmeiras after joining in February.

Mario Cortegana

Even as their  Brazilian rivals have made a habit of making splashy signings from European football over the past decade, Fluminense have generally been more circumspect. This is in large part due to their financial situation: compared to the country's big hitters — Palmeiras, Flamengo, Corinthians — they have a pretty modest budget and prefer to cut their cloth accordingly.

It was no surprise, then, that a source at the club immediately rejected the idea that Rio de Janeiro-based Fluminense could offer Ronaldo a new challenge.

Jack Lang

Another Brazilian side who have no interest in, and have had no discussions over, signing Ronaldo.

Although the club's owner, John Textor, attended Al Nassr training sessions due to his relationship with their chief executive Majed AlJamaan, any suggestion that he might join the Rio side or that he would be involved in the Eagle Football multi-club vehicle where Textor is chairman have been described to The Athletic as “a bizarre fantasy story”.

Matt Woosnam

Flamengo have also ruled out a move for Ronaldo ahead of the Club World Cup, mainly for financial reasons. Jorginho's arrival from Arsenal is their latest planned move for the tournament.

Jose Boto, Flamengo's sporting director, is Portuguese and has very good contacts in his home country, which could potentially facilitate the deal at some point. However, it is not something Rio-based Flamengo have seriously considered.

Mario Cortegana

Inter's American ownership, the asset management firm Oaktree, has provided stability and financial security for this weekend's Champions League finalists. They are also committed to rejuvenating a squad that is the oldest in this season's Champions League.

“Investments will be made in slightly younger profiles who represent a real asset, players with potential who are an asset for the present and the future,” Inter's CEO Giuseppe Marotta explained to The Athletic this week. That doesn't sound like Ronaldo, who turned 40 in February.

Advertisement

Marotta was at Juventus when Ronaldo joined them in 2018, but that was a signing driven by colleague Fabio Paratici. Marotta left the club a few months later, and Inter have since replaced Juventus as the real force in Italian football.

The prospect of Marotta signing Ronaldo for Inter — regardless of the new ownership's strategy for the Milanese club — is unlikely.

James Horncastle

Ronaldo and City manager Pep Guardiola nearly joined forces in 2021 before he decided to return to neighbours United from Juventus at the eleventh hour. A deal was broadly agreed then, but long phone conversations with former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and ex-Old Trafford team-mate Rio Ferdinand convinced Ronaldo how ruinous switching to the other side of Manchester would be for his legacy.

At the time, City were also looking at Harry Kane to fill the centre-forward void left by the departure during the same window of Sergio Aguero. There is no such vacancy now that they have Erling Haaland, who has committed himself to the club for the next decade. City also added Omar Marmoush to their attacking ranks in January and are attempting to bring down the average age of the squad.

Ronaldo is into his fifth decade, his powers are understandably waning, and he is unlikely to be able to play on one of the wings anymore. That said, the way Guardiola has incorporated Haaland into his team by allowing him not to get involved in any build-up play is a dilution of his football idealism that was not known four years ago.

It would have been fun to see Guardiola work with Ronaldo, having played such an important role in Messi's first few years at Barcelona, but the chances of it happening are virtually zero.

Jordan Campbell

Since his departure from Madrid to join Juventus, Ronaldo has explored the possibility of moving back to the Bernabeu on several occasions. The last opportunity was two years ago, when he was on his way out of United.

According to senior sources at Madrid, his agent at the time, Jorge Mendes, offered him to them several times during the summer of 2023, with very advantageous financial conditions.

Advertisement

The club's stance has always been clear in these situations, as it was during this season when the possibility of Sergio Ramos returning also came up: they have total gratitude for both players' time at the club, but they believe it should be left in the past.

Madrid are committed to their project, which is now focused on new blood, without focusing on the economic elements.

Mario Cortegana and Guillermo Rai

There is zero chance. Bayern's forward line will be led by Kane this summer in the States, and Ronaldo would offer nothing beyond unhelpful media attention.

The German champions are paying no attention to his availability at all.

Sebastian Stafford-Bloor

The French club have not made any moves in terms of Ronaldo, and has no plans to do so. Their total focus is on the Champions League final showdown with Inter on Saturday night, which also shows why bringing him in is not among their plans.

Their overall project as a club has pivoted since manager Luis Enrique's 2024 arrival to build a team based on their Spanish coach and young talent, moving away from the collection of the world's most famous stars previously in the line-up.

The success of this season reinforces this idea and has led to renewing the contracts in recent months of the aforementioned Luis Enrique and sporting director Luis Campos, who is always in close contact with club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi.

Mario Cortegana

In Serhou Guirassy, Dortmund believe they have one of the in-form forwards in European football and they will head to the U.S. fully confident in their ability to score plenty of goals in this tournament.

There's no conversation to be had about signing Ronaldo.

Sebastian Stafford-Bloor

Ronaldo will not be joining Atletico for the Club World Cup.

The Spanish club are taking the tournament very seriously, and coach Diego Simeone's team will be playing their usual high-intensity, hard-working style, and have top internationals such as Julian Alvarez, Alexander Sorloth and Antoine Griezmann to lead their attack.

Advertisement

Adding the 40-year-old former Madrid player for their U.S. challenge would just not make sense.

Dermot Corrigan

Porto have no interest in signing Ronaldo, who came through the academy at one of their great domestic rivals, Lisbon's Sporting CP.

They are, however, focusing their efforts on another (far younger) forward from the Saudi Pro League: Gabri Veiga. The 23-year-old made a surprise move from Celta Vigo to Al Ahli two years ago and is a key target for them this summer.

James Horncastle

Ronaldo supported Benfica as a young boy, but it would be a colossal surprise if they were to approach him now.

He came through the youth ranks at their local Lisbon rivals, Sporting, and it would need a huge amount of PR massaging to make a cross-city move look like anything other than a betrayal, even at this late stage of his career. He also once stuck a middle finger up at Benfica fans while playing for United, so the appetite from their supporters for his signing might also be limited.

Jack Lang

In recent seasons, the Mexicans have been known for signing La Liga stars such as Sergio Canales and especially Sergio Ramos.

For that reason, it might seem logical that they would be looking to do the same with Ronaldo. However, very senior sources at Monterrey played down this option ahead of the Club World Cup: “We haven't moved on anything at all. But there is so much noise that, if he wants to come and he comes for free, then we will think about it.”

Guillermo Rai

A source close to Ronaldo told The Athletic last week that it would not make sense for Al Nassr to renew his contract and then move him out on loan to a team playing in the Club World Cup.

That said, a renewal is not out of the question. However, a source at the Riyadh club suggested it depended in part on the outcome of their season — and this came to a negative end, with Al Nassr finishing third in the Saudi Pro League, having lost in the Asian Champions League's semi-finals.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Club World Cup provides motivation, not distraction","https://www.sounderatheart.com/2025/05/club-world-cup-provides-motivation-not-distraction/","Sat, 31 May 2025 01:26:22 GMT","

Sounders well aware that they can head into break with a share of the Western Conference lead.

RENTON — For most of the season, the Seattle Sounders have done their best to deflect questions about the Club World Cup being any sort of distraction. The general messaging has been something along the lines of “we'll deal with when we get there.”

With the Club World Cup trophy literally on site during Friday's training session as part of its tour around the Seattle area, the tournament became considerably harder to ignore.

Sounders head coach Brian Schmetzer opened his press conference talking about the excitement of welcoming fans from all over the world to Seattle and the surreal nature of watching a team his team will face in about three weeks play in the UEFA Champions League final on Saturday. 

Asked about preparing for a pair of upcoming games against Minnesota United on Sunday and the Vancouver Whitecaps a week later, Schmetzer first quipped “that's a really beautiful trophy.”

Joking aside, he was also well aware that the Sounders have it within their grasp to head into the Club World Cup break with the most points in the Western Conference if they were to win those games. The Whitecaps' only match between now and June 8 is the Concacaf Champions Cup final on Sunday, and the Sounders currently trail them by six points. 

“Yes, we totally understand, we have an opportunity,” Schmetzer said. “If we can do the business, that would put us in a really good run of form to start focusing on, maybe winning one of these games.

“There's work to be done, but the guys are ready.”

Schmetzer is also confident that his veteran group can both be excited about what's ahead and still focused on the upcoming games, perhaps even using the impending tournament as motivation.

“You have a group of players that have been around this franchise, been around me, my voice for a long time,” Schmetzer said. “I think we're all pretty grounded human beings, individuals.

“They saw this, they got excited today, but they have heard the message that Minnesota is the most important game, because it's the next game.”

Minnesota United are one of the surprise teams during the first half of the season. Leaning into an offense that is deadly in transition and off set-pieces, the Loons are on pace to have less possession than any other team on record in MLS history while also boasting a +9 goal-difference that is tied for second best in the West.

They are coming off a midweek 0-0 tie with the Vancouver Whitecaps and elected to remain the Pacific Northwest rather than fly back and forth.

This will be the fourth time the Sounders have faced Minnesota since they hired Eric Ramsay as coach. The Sounders won all three meetings last year, but Minnesota still impressed Schmetzer.

“Their strengths they are hard to beat,” Schmetzer said about Minnesota. “He's learned, he's figured out his team, he's figured out what his particular group needs to be successful.”","{'href': 'https://www.sounderatheart.com', 'title': 'Sounder at Heart'}","soccer"

This summer will see the first edition of the new-look Club World Cup tournament, as the likes of Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid prepare to compete for the prestigious trophy.

This new competition is really an expanded version of the Club World Cup we've seen before, but which previously featured fewer teams.

Chelsea and Man City have actually won the trophy before, as have Manchester United and Liverpool, but Premier League clubs previously had to qualify by winning the Champions League, and even then would only take part in a semi-final and final.

So, how does the new-look Club World Cup look and when is it on this summer? We've got all the info for you below…

Not long after the traditional end of the club season, fans can look forward to even more football as the Club World Cup kicks off on the 15th of June.

The biggest names from England Europe to watch out for are Chelsea, Manchester City, Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain, Inter Milan and Juventus.

From elsewhere, we could see some big-name players in action for Saudi and MLS clubs.

Lionel Messi's Inter Miami will undoubtedly be one star attraction, while Al Hilal also boast big names like Ruben Neves, Kalidou Koulibaly and Joao Cancelo on their books.

And of course, there are so often some underrated gems to watch out for from South America, so keep an eye on Brazilian sides Palmeiras and Fluminense, as well as Argentinian giants Boca Juniors and River Plate.

There's a huge amount up for grabs for the winners of the 2025 Club World cup – £97m ($125m).

It may be a new tournament, at least in this format, but it's no wonder clubs have been so keen to take part in it even after such long and gruelling seasons.

For comparison, you can win £176m for winning the Premier League, £135m for winning the Champions League, and just £3.9m for the FA Cup.

In another unusual twist for this summer, there will be a mini transfer window running from June 1st until June 10th before a longer one later on.

This allows clubs competing in the Club World Cup to bring in new players early so they can compete in the tournament.

Player contracts tend to run from July 1st until June 30th, so it also means we're seeing things like Trent Alexander-Arnold moving to Real Madrid for a €10m fee, rather than waiting to join as a free agent later.

If Real had waited to sign Alexander-Arnold at the end of his contract, he'd have been free, but wouldn't have been able to play for them in the Club World Cup, so Madrid will feel it was worth paying a small amount to get him in earlier.

When you look at the prize money on offer, with Los Blancos sure to be one of the tournament favourites, it's hard to argue against that probably being a smart decision.

There's no doubt that the introduction of this new tournament has attracted criticism.

On the face of it, it's pretty clear that this is yet another money-spinner by FIFA, and it seems far from ideal for player welfare.

We're already seeing so many injuries due to high work load, with the footballing calendar busier than ever, and with the modern game so fast and intense.

Fans will be glad of more football to watch over the summer, but it will be interesting to see what kind of quality of football we see from what may likely be a lot of tired players.

Olivier Giroud has won the World Cup and UEFA Champions League during his decorated career, yet even Los Angeles FC's famed French striker is impressed by the extraordinary nature of the stakes when his team hosts Club América on Saturday night.

The winner of this one-game play-in match gets the final spot in the FIFA Club World Cup and the remarkable chance for a North American team to face world soccer powers in the biggest-ever edition of this summer competition.

""To get the opportunity to play that kind of competition is a big chance for the boys,"" Giroud said. ""We need to grab the opportunity.""

What's more, the winning team at BMO Stadium will be guaranteed at least $9.55 million for its Club World Cup berth, along with a shot at nearly $100 million from the tournament's biggest-ever prize pool of nearly $1 billion.

Even the setting is tantalizing: Thanks to equal ticket distribution, LAFC's sold-out arena will be packed with raucous supporters of both the home team and the biggest professional club in Mexico. Los Angeles' passion for all forms of Mexican soccer is famously rabid, and América has legions of Southern California fans.

No wonder the players and coaches involved are expecting a career-defining experience in this big-money match.

""It's massive,"" LAFC center back Aaron Long said. ""I think the stakes are probably as high as it can get. Two titans of North America battling it out. I'm sure BMO will be on a different level. I'm sure fans from both sides are going to be going all-in, giving 100%. If you're a fan, these are the games you want to go and see. It's going to be incredible.""

The Club World Cup includes 32 teams for the first time, and it is being held across the U.S. one year before the FIFA World Cup returns to North America. Two Major League Soccer clubs and two Liga MX clubs have already qualified for the event, and LAFC or América will join them based on the results of this one match.

Giroud has done just about everything in world soccer - except this. Chelsea won the Champions League with Giroud in 2021 to earn a Club World Cup spot, but Giroud left for AC Milan before it happened.

""This is the kind of match you need to play at 110%,"" Giroud said. ""I've never played in it. It could be nice to meet Chelsea again, but obviously it will be a massive game (first).""

Indeed, the winner of the play-in match will face Chelsea, Brazil's Flamengo and Tunisia's ES Tunis in group play.

LAFC and América got this opportunity after FIFA disqualified León because of its rules against participation by multiple clubs owned by the same entity. León and fellow Liga MX qualifier Pachuca are owned by the same group, and León lost its appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport after attempting to change its ownership structure.

The decision was only finalized 3 1/2 weeks ago, necessitating this quick one-game playoff for the final spot.

The matchup will also serve as an informal referendum on the usually friendly competition between MLS and Liga MX for unofficial recognition as North America's top professional league. LAFC and América already met in a preseason friendly in Los Angeles this year, but the play-in is a different animal.

""I believe this game will be prepared like a final,"" said LAFC goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, another World Cup champion.

""It's going to be interesting to face one of the best Mexican clubs, and it's going to be tough, challenging, but it's also what you play football for,"" Lloris added. ""When I signed for LAFC, I didn't expect to have this type of opportunity. I know that in life and in football, when you have this kind of opportunity, you have to do everything to take it.""

LAFC has enjoyed steady success since its MLS debut in 2018, winning the MLS Cup playoff championship in 2022 and earning two Supporters' Shields for the best regular-season record. LAFC is unbeaten in eight matches since a CONCACAF Champions League qualifier loss to Club World Cup invitee Inter Miami last April.

América is generally considered both the most popular and the most decorated club in Mexico, and Las Águilas have been on top of Liga MX for much of the previous three seasons. Their Brazilian coach, André Jardine, attracted international praise while his team won three straight titles before losing the Clausura final to Toluca last Sunday night, falling just short of becoming only the second team in Mexico's history to win four consecutive championships.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","LAFC vs. Club America: Club World Cup Play-In Preview, Predictions, Lineups","https://www.si.com/soccer/lafc-vs-club-america-club-world-cup-play-in-preview-predictions-lineups-6-1-25","Sat, 31 May 2025 08:15:00 GMT","

LAFC will host Club América at BMO Stadium for a Play-In game to decide the final participant in the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup.

The winner of the match will not only replace Club León in Group D of the new-look tournament, but will also bag $9.55 million in prize money just for qualifying, making this one of the biggest games ever in the MLS vs. Liga MX rivalry.

LAFC were selected to participate in the Play-In game because they were the team that lost to León in the 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup final, the result that provisionally secured León's birth in the Club World Cup.

Club América, on the other hand, were picked because they were the top seeded team in FIFA's Concacaf club rankings, thanks to deep runs in the Concacaf Champions Cup recently and three straight Liga MX titles.

Although the game is taking place at LAFC's home stadium, a large contingent of Club América fans are expected to paint the stands yellow in what promises to be an absolute spectacle. Here's all you need to know ahead of LAFC vs. Club América battle for the final ticket to the Club World Cup.

There's an argument to be made that this is LAFC's biggest game since in their debut season in 2018. 

Steve Cherundolo's side arrive to the match riding an eight-game unbeaten streak in MLS, having scored 19 goals during that run. But the surge in attacking firepower has been matched by LAFC's leaky defense that's conceded 12 goals in that same span, resulting in the team winning just three games in that stretch, drawing the other five.

LAFC's back line can't afford to perform at the level they've displayed recently considering Club América's attack very well might be the best they've faced all year.

Denis Bouanga's 10 goals in all competitions this season lead the way for LAFC and he'll carry the bulk of the attacking burden. However, Olivier Giroud's big-game experience could prove to be a difference maker, with the Frenchman looking for a performance worthy of a franchise player.

Timothy Tillman is the only major injury blow Cherundolo has to deal with, other than him, he's got the rest of his roster at his disposal to defeat the Liga MX giants.

LAFC Predicted Lineup vs. Club America (4-3-3): Lloris; Palencia, Long, Segura, Hollingshead; Amaya, Jesus, Delgado; Ordaz, Ebobisse, Bouanga

Las Águilas are still licking their wounds after losing the Liga MX Clausura 2025 final last weekend, ending their quest to become the second team in Mexican top-flight history to win four titles in a row.

Even after such a devastating defeat, Las Águilas are a formidable foe, perhaps even more dangerous now as they look for revenge following last Sunday's heartbreak. 

América were held scoreless in back-to-back games for only the third time in the last four years and they haven't fired blanks in three straight games since the start of the decade. An eerie omen for LAFC.

However, the health status of captain and talisman Henry Martín has stolen the headlines all week. The legendary striker was forced to exit Sunday's final with a muscular injury and although reports indicate Jardine will play him, his minutes will likely be limited.

A positive for Las Águilas is the return of former LAFC winger Brian Rodríguez. The Uruguay international returned after over a month in the sidelines and will certainly play a key role in América's attack at his former home.

Club America Predicted Lineup vs. LAFC (5-3-2): Malagón; Álvarez, Reyes, Cáceres, Juárez, Borja; Dos Santos, Sánchez, Fidalgo; Zendejas, Aguirre

It's a cracking matchup on paper between two of the best teams in the region in one of the highest-stakes games of the MLS vs. Liga MX rivalry to date.

Both teams will likely open the game cautiously, analyzing their opponent and trying assert their control of the contest. As the minutes tick on, scoring chances will begin presenting themselves for both teams.

However, after trading punches, it could be Club América who emerges victorious. Jardine's extensive track-record of brilliant knockout-stage game plans may very well prove to be key. América are poised to frustrate LAFC with their stout and experienced defensive line and the Alvaro Zendejas–Alvaro Fidalgo duo will be difficult to contain for 90 minutes, especially if Martín is fit enough to enter the game in the second half.

In the end, the winningest club in Liga MX and Concacaf Champions Cup history are favorites to secure the final ticket to the FIFA Club World Cup 2025, winning the most expensive match in North American Soccer history.

Few professionals have the experience Olivier Giroud and Hugo Lloris do on soccer's biggest stages.

When the close friends and 2018 FIFA World Cup champions joined forces in Major League Soccer last year, Giroud and Lloris did so hoping to win together one more time. But neither 38-year-old French legend contemplated that that effort would include something they'd not done before.

With the last spot in the 32-team 2025 FIFA Club World Cup riding on the outcome, that “amazing opportunity,” declared Lloris, is contingent on the Los Angeles Football Club winning a high-stakes showdown Saturday night at sold-out BMO Stadium against Mexican giant Club América.

A guaranteed $9.55 million payday goes to the winning club, as does entry into the tournament's Group D alongside Brazilian standout Flamengo, Espérance Sportive de Tunis and English power Chelsea FC.

Whoever wins Saturday will begin group play against Chelsea on June 16 in Atlanta.

“It could be nice to meet Chelsea again,” shared Giroud, who was part of the Stamford Bridge squad that won its way into the tournament by claiming the 2020-21 UEFA Champions League title. “Obviously, it will be a massive game at the weekend against América.”

While France's all-time leading scorer was notching goals in West London for The Blues and internationally with Les Bleus, Lloris stopped them in the northern part of the city for Tottenham and, as his country's longest-tenured captain, across four trips to the FIFA World Cup.

“After so many years in this business I know when you have an opportunity you have to grab it, take it,” said Lloris, who finished runner-up in the 2019 Champions League final, one of 70 appearances in the tournament since 2008. “There's nothing for granted in football. Just live the moment. Enjoy the moment. But at the same time you don't want to have any regrets.”

Poise and results in pressure-packed games rank high among the reasons LAFC brought in the veteran winners. The season prior to their arrival, regret in similar situations became the Black & Gold story.

LAFC could have secured a spot in the Club World Cup via the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League, but that team ultimately fell flat, losing the two-leg final to Liga MX's Club León.

“This in a sense is a way to redeem that and get us that berth in the Club World Cup,” said defender Ryan Hollingshead, who struggled off the bench that day and acknowledged lingering regret.

The first of three unsuccessful finals for LAFC during head coach Steve Cherundolo's second season seemed to dash the Black & Gold's hope of qualifying for the new-look, high-profile tournament in the U.S. from June 14 to July 13 that boasts a record prize pool of $1 billion.

As fate would have it, six of the 22 LAFC players listed on the team sheet for the second leg against León will get a rare second bite at the apple. On May 6, the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport finalized a ruling that affirmed FIFA's decision to deem León ineligible for the Club World Cup because of ownership ties to the group that runs Pachuca, which also qualified by winning last year's CONCACAF title.

FIFA's contingency plan put LAFC, an 8-year-old MLS team, in the dare-to-dream scenario opposite 108-year-old América, which, despite losing the Liga MX Clausura final to Toluca on Tuesday, has reigned over Mexican soccer in recent years.

The teams' only official encounter came in 2020. A dramatic 3-1 win for LAFC spearheaded by Mexican great Carlos Vela, who scored twice in two minutes, sent the Black & Gold into the CONCACAF Champions League final for the first time in its history.

(If América needed a reminder about the pandemic-era loss at a neutral site in Orlando, this week LAFC announced Vela's official retirement and named the 35-year-old attacker the first Black & Gold Ambassador.)

Although Saturday's contest takes place on the LAFC grounds, the match, run by FIFA, should take on a neutral feel, mimicking the 50/50 atmosphere from the clubs' preseason meeting at BMO Stadium in February.

“Listen, last time we played them in our stadium, I know it was only a friendly game, but there was more yellow in the stands than black jerseys,” noted Lloris, who became familiar with América while playing in Europe.

Home fans, the 3252, will occupy the standing section in the North End. A strong contingent of América supporters is expected to overtake the opposite side of the stadium for a game that requires two 15-minute periods of extra time and the potential for a penalty shootout if the score is tied at the end of regulation.

LAFC enters the match unbeaten in its last eight – three wins and five draws in MLS regular-season action – since falling to Inter Miami in the CONCACAF Champions Cup quarterfinals on April 9, an outcome that felt as self-inflicted as the faulty finals in 2023.

To get things right against América, Giroud and Lloris prescribed a sense of calm and serenity on the pitch, all the while matching or surpassing the opponent's confidence, energy and intensity.

“That's the only way to face bigger clubs,” Lloris said. “It's easy to talk. But the most important truth is what is going to happen on the field.”

When: Saturday, 7:30 p.m.

Where: BMO Stadium

RIVERSIDE, Mo. — The Kansas City area is getting ready to experience the World Cup next year. But some residents are already familiar with the emotions of being on the center stage of international sporting events.

Debinha and Lorena from Brazil, along with Rocky Rodriguez from Costa Rica, are three KC Current team members who have played for their national teams.

They say it's a dream.

“It's an unmatched, inexplicable emotion,” Lorena, who is currently in Brazil with the national team, said. “It's more than an honor, it's a privilege.”

“It's unlike any other feeling for me,” said Rocky.

She scored Costa Rica's first-ever Women's World Cup goal during the 2015 FIFA World Cup.

“It's the best thing,” said Debinha. “I think playing in a World Cup is the top achievement a player can aspire to.”

They believe it will be a two-way street with Kansas City experiencing the competition and the competition experiencing Kansas City.

“I'm excited not only for the people here to have this experience, but also for the opportunity to see different cultures and everything,” Debinha said.

“It feels like a huge party here, and I think that Kansas City deserves to be one of the hosting cities for that reason,” Rocky said. “Soccer just brings people together.”

Lorena said visitors will be surprised with how strong a following the game has developed in Kansas City.

“People have no idea how passionately soccer is embraced here in KC. I arrived thinking it would be just a fan base, but it's not just a fan base; it's a fan base that breathes soccer,” Lorena said.

For the three players, it will also be a chance to wear their national team jerseys, but this time not as players, but as fans.

“Usually, you have to make plans to go to a World Cup, but the World Cup itself is coming here,"" Rocky said. ""I think that's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I do feel blessed and lucky, you know, because everyone would want to be here.”

Tunisian champions Espérance de Tunis might be going to the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup without any reinforcements. The Tunis based side will fly out to the United States on June 6th.

Espérance president Hamdi Meddeb is against the notion that the club should go on a spending spree ahead of the Club World Cup. EST were keen on signing Algerian striker Baghdad Bounedjah from Qatar as well as Tunisia national team defender Dylan Bronn but now those potential transfers appear unlikely, at least for now. 

According to Tunisian daily La Presse, the Blood and Gold will be opting to play the international tournament without any new signings. New signings were also planned for the new Tunisian Ligue 1 season and the CAF Champions League with players like Bounedjah, Bronn and TP Mazembe defender Ibrahima Keita among the names linked to EST. The club last won the continental tournament back in 2019.

Espérance are in Group D alongside UEFA Conference League champions Chelsea, Brazilian side Flamengo, and Mexican outfit León. EST will face Stade Tunisien in the final of the Tunisian Cup on June 1 before embarking to the USA where their first opponent will be Brazilian giants Flamengo on June 16.

The biggest game of the European season is all set for Munich on Saturday - but where will the European Cup be won and lost?

Here we are. After 188 matches, 613 goals, 33 red cards, one pleasantly chaotic league phase and two legs of the greatest knockout tie in competition history, the Champions League final is upon us. Paris Saint-Germain and Inter have made their way to Munich for Saturday's mouth-watering showpiece as they prepare to bring the curtain down on another breath-taking European campaign.

PSG come into this game knowing that they have never had a better of chance of finally winning the Champions League. After a slow start to the post-Kylian Mbappe era, Luis Enrique's side found their groove around the turn of the year and never looked back. The Ligue 1 champions got a real taste for Premier League blood in particular, as they beat Manchester City to stay alive in the league phase before knocking out Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal in successive rounds to reach the final.

Inter, meanwhile, have qualified for their second final in three seasons, and after being gallant losers against Man City in 2023, Simone Inzaghi's side know they cannot let another of these opportunities slip by them. They certainly didn't have an easy route, either, as they knocked out German champions Bayern Munich and Spanish title-winners Barcelona along the way, and while they may have collapsed in the battle to win Serie A, they have shown themselves to be one of the consistently best teams on the continent under Inzaghi's tutelage.

Henrique Rocha arrived at Roland Garros having lost nine of 10 matches, in part due to an abdominal injury he suffered earlier in the season. His lone victory during the stretch came against the No. 647 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. 

But momentum can add up quickly on the ATP Tour, and that is what has happened in Paris for the rising Portuguese star. Following one of the toughest moments of his young career, Rocha has thrust himself into his brightest spotlight yet. The 21-year-old will face Alexander Bublik on Saturday to reach the fourth round at the clay-court major.

After rallying from two sets down against Miami champion Jakub Mensik in the second round, Rocha focussed on the group of Portuguese players rather than himself. Rocha and Nuno Borges, who lost his match Friday, became the first men from their country to reach the third round at Roland Garros in tournament history and the first Portuguese duo to make the third round at the same Grand Slam tournament.

“We have a great team. We have a fitness coach, psychologist, nutritionists, of course coaches, physios. We have everything we need to be very good players,” Rocha said in a press conference, referencing himself, Borges and 21-year-old Portuguese Jaime Faria, who cracked the Top 100 this year. “The three of us were practising together. It's also very good to always improve with each other.”



Rocha is the son of two big tennis fans, Marta and Jorge. His brother Francisco played the sport, so Henrique would go to watch and help at his practice sessions. Inevitably, Rocha picked up the sport and trained in Maia until age 15, when he moved to Lisbon to train with the Portuguese Tennis Federation.

Former World No. 59 Rui Machado, the technical director for the federation, called one of his old coaches, Andre Lopes, about working with Rocha. Lopes had not personally met Rocha until this year, when they began their partnership alongside Pedro Sousa.

“I always heard that he had a lot of potential with shots that are quite hard and plays fast, and he's very strong physically. He has a very strong competitive mentality. This is what I heard in the past and obviously before starting working with him,” Lopes told ATPTour.com. “Once I started to work with him, that's exactly what I noticed, he has a great potential. 

“His shots are really, really fast and he can play really hard, which I think is a big advantage for him, together with his competitive mentality.”

They have been working hard to make Rocha's game more stable and organise his firepower in the best possible way to take advantage of those tools. Their efforts faced a setback in February when Rocha hurt his abdominal during the warmup for a match. After a break that lasted around a month, he struggled with a lack of matches, which led to difficulty finding rhythm and his ensuing skid.

 

Since the ATP Challenger Tour event in Estoril last month, Rocha has been competing well and moving in the right direction, according to Lopes. That effort has been rewarded on the Parisian clay, where the Portuguese won a two-hour, 59-minute three-setter in the final round of qualifying against Luca Van Assche and then back-to-back five-setters against Nikoloz Basilashvili and Mensik in the first two rounds of the main draw.

“Luckily it's paying off in a big tournament,” Lopes said. “It could have paid off maybe two weeks ago or two months later, but I think it's a good tournament to pay off. So hopefully we'll keep going.”


The Mensik match was particularly challenging. The soaring Czech led by two sets and a break against an opponent who had never played a five-set match before the first round.

“I would say the challenge of being two sets down against a player like Mensik was a huge challenge,” Lopes said. “We believed from the beginning that if he would play at a good level, he would have his chances to win. But being two sets down and a break down in the third makes it very, very tough to come back.”


It was another sign of progress for Rocha, who is up to No. 148 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. He now owns a 6-3 tour-level record according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.


“He's breaking his own barriers, setting challenges day by day. Somehow, everything is happening quite fast,” Lopes said. “But I think at the same time, it's very conscious of what he's doing, still focusing on the small details, trying to improve little things, even in the warmup, before the match, we chat a lot after the match.


“So I see him very, very focused, very calm, and handling in a very good way, the emotions connected to an experience like this.”


Lopes explained that it is important for Rocha to remain work grounded in this moment and remain focused on the process of working hard each day.


“He needs to work hard every week, every month of the season, and sometimes it will pay off, sometimes it won't,” Lopes said. “But at the end, the mentality of getting better and improving as a player needs to be there, basically, until he ends his career.”

Jannik Sinner sent a letter of intent Saturday at Roland Garros, where he brushed past Jiri Lehecka in just 94 minutes to reach the fourth round.

The top seed produced a lights-out display to prevail 6-0, 6-1, 6-2 and maintain his perfect set record at the clay-court major in Paris. Sinner, who dropped just nine points on serve across the match, according to Infosys Stats, also extended his winning streak at Grand Slam tournaments to 17 matches.

“I was playing really really well,” said Sinner. “Especially for two and a half sets, then he was serving very well, very brave. He made some good serve and volleys. But I'm very happy. Simone [Vagnozzi], my coach, had his birthday yesterday, and usually when he has his birthday, I don't play well. So this win is for him.”



Competing on an overcast day on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, Sinner displayed expertly disciplined shot-making from the baseline, which was coupled with his ability to combat Lehecka's serve with ease. This was highlighted by a series of rasping return winners he hit throughout the clash, including two from his forehand wing in the penultimate game of the second set.

After improving to 15-1 on the season, Sinner will continue his Roland Garros campaign against Andrey Rublev, whom he leads 6-3 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The 17th-seeded Rublev advanced to the fourth round via walkover after home favourite Arthur Fils withdrew due to injury.

Sinner, who is next week set to complete 52 consecutive weeks at No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, has now advanced to the fourth round in 14 of his past 15 major appearances. The Italian owns a 19-5 record at Roland Garros, underscored by his run to last year's semi-final before falling to rival Carlos Alcaraz in five sets.
In Saturday's third-round clash with the World No. 34 Lehecka, Sinner struck a total of 30 winners to just nine unforced errors to improve to 64 consecutive wins against players ranked outside the Top 20. This year in Paris, he is seeded for a quarter-final meeting with fifth seed Jack Draper, who brushed aside #NextGenATP star Joao Fonseca in straight sets on Saturday afternoon.




Over on Court Philippe-Chatrier, last year's runner-up, Alexander Zverev reached the fourth round for an eighth consecutive year by defeating Flavio Cobolli 6-2, 7-6(4), 6-1 and snapping the Hamburg champion's seven-match winning streak.
“This court is very special to me. I had some of the best memories of my life on this court, but I also had some of the worst memories on this court,"" said Zverev, who suffered an ankle injury, which required surgery, in the 2022 semi-finals against Rafael Nadal. ""It's a love story that hasn't got to the happy end yet, but I hope someday it will.”
Zverev is just the eighth man in the Open Era to make eight or more consecutive appearances in the Roland Garros fourth round. The 28-year-old now owns an impressive 37-9 record at the clay-court major.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Sabalenka defends Djokovic against critics: 'Let Novak show his greatness'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sabalenka-djokovic-roland-garros-2025","Sat, 31 May 2025 14:21:44 GMT","

Novak Djokovic continues to defy the aging curve with his achievements. The 38-year-old is fresh from capturing his 100th tour-level trophy and is this week chasing a record 25th major title at Roland Garros.

Yet while some still question Djokovic's ability to compete at the highest level, Hologic WTA No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka sent a clear message in defence of the former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings and his eye-catching achievements.

“You are trying to put as much pressure as you can on Novak. Leave him alone,” Sabalenka candidly said in a press conference in Paris when asked about Djokovic's longevity. “Look at him. He's fit, strong. Mentally, physically, I think he's ready to play another two, three years. He's doing really well.

“Of course, [there are] ups and downs, everyone has [them]. I believe the older you get, the tougher it gets to stay consistent on the level. But we see whenever he's ready, whenever he's healthy and fit, he's there, and he's playing great tennis.”



While Sabalenka acknowledged the inevitable challenges that come with a prolonged tennis career, she emphasised Djokovic's proven ability to rise to the occasion.

Referring to 14-time Roland Garros champion Rafael Nadal's farewell ceremony Sunday, where his greatest rivals Djokovic, Roger Federer and Andy Murray were present, Sabalenka also pointed to the absence of the ‘Big Four' as a poignant reminder of the sport's shifting landscape.

“Imagine if he retires tomorrow, then everyone is going to be sad, no? Then there is another 10, 15 years for Jannik [Sinner] and [Carlos] Alcaraz to become one of the greatest,” added Sabalenka. “But just let him be.

“It was so sad to see the ceremony, the ‘Big Four' were on the court and you understand that three of them are retired. Everyone is missing their games. So let's just let Novak be there to show and fight and show his greatness and to inspire that generation.”

Djokovic has experienced a turbulent season since reaching the semi-finals at the Australian Open, where he was forced to retire against Alexander Zverev. He notably fell to opening-round defeats in Doha, Indian Wells, Monte-Carlo and Madrid, but dismissed any doubts by winning his 100th title in Geneva last week.
With a third-round victory over Filip Misolic at Roland Garros — their first Lexus ATP Head2Head clash — Djokovic would record his 99th match win at Roland Garros, which would equal his best mark at a single Grand Slam tournament. He owns a 98-16 record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, heading into Saturday's match.

Just one day after news broke of Stefanos Tsitsipas' new partnership with the former No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Goran Ivanisevic, the Greek star publicly shared his excitement.

“I'm happy to begin a new chapter with Goran Ivanisevic joining my team as coach,” Tsitsipas wrote in a statement on Instagram Stories. “Goran's experience, passion for the sport, and champion's mindset are things I greatly respect, and I'm looking forward to the journey ahead with him by my side. I'm optimistic about what we can build together.”

Ivanisevic was a standout player — earning his place in the International Tennis Hall of Fame — and also helped Novak Djokovic to great heights as the Serbian's longtime coach.



The 26-year-old Tsitsipas also thanked coaches Kerei Abakar and Dimitris Chatzinikolaou for their help.

“I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude too Kerei and Dimitris for their dedication, support, and work over the past few months,” Tsitsipas wrote. “Working with them has been a meaningful chapter in my journey, and I'm deeply thankful for the effort and commitment they brought to the team.”

Tsitsipas owns an 18-11 record this season according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He is No. 26 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

Jack Draper laid down another marker in his standout season on Saturday at Roland Garros, where he dispatched the supremely talented #NextGenATP Brazilian Joao Fonseca 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 to reach the fourth round in Paris for the first time.

Hype was high surrounding Draper's second Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with 18-year-old Fonseca, who had not dropped a set en route to reaching the third round at a major for the first time.

However, the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion Fonseca struggled for consistency. He was unable to live with Draper's power and physicality in the hot and lively conditions on Court Suzanne-Lenglen. The British lefty hit his heavy topspin forehand with depth and was relaxed for large periods, striking with liquid power to dominate the brutal baseline exchanges.

The 23-year-old won 93 per cent of his first-serve points and committed 20 unforced errors to Fonseca's 38, according to Infosys Stats, to advance after one hour and 49 minutes.

""I played good. The conditions were quite difficult out here. I felt that the first set was really key,"" Draper said. ""Then I kind of got on top of him, used my forehand well, served well and mentally it was a good performance from me and I am happy to be in the second week here.""

Cool, calm, clinical 🧼A commanding 6-2 6-4 6-2 win over Fonseca takes @jackdraper0 into the Round of 16!@rolandgarros | #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/YE0mQKpv3Y

Draper arrived at Roland Garros having not won a match in two previous appearances at the clay-court major. Physically firing, No. 5 in the PIF ATP Rankings is a different proposition this year, though.

The lefty captured his maiden ATP Masters 1000 title in Indian Wells in March ­– defeating Fonseca en route – and then reached the championship match on clay in Madrid. Holding a 25-6 record on the season, Draper will continue the quest for his first major against Alexander Bublik, who beat Portuguese qualifier Henrique Rocha 7-5, 6-1, 6-2.

""In my first two rounds I played in the night time and playing against Gael [Monfils] the other night I didn't feel I could hit the ball past him,"" Draper said on the conditions at this year's Roland Garros. ""The guy is so quick and it was so cold. But today the ball was getting up more and the faster conditions help me more.""



Fonseca defeated Hubert Hurkacz and Pierre-Hugues Herbert to advance to the third round in Paris. Earlier this season the 18-year-old upset Andrey Rublev at the Australian Open and captured his maiden ATP Tour title at the 250 event in Buenos Aires.

The Brazilian was backed by vocal support throughout his three matches in the French capital but was unable to give them anything to cheer about against Draper, overhitting all too often. The 18-year-old leaves Roland Garros up 10 places at No. 55 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

""Joao is someone who has come onto the Tour and caught the attention of everyone, the players, the fans. He is an incredible young player and so much to come from him,"" Draper said on Fonseca. ""I think today maybe a bit of experience [was the difference]. He hasn't played as many Grand Slams as myself but I think he has an incredibly bright future at the top of the game.""

Norrie 6-3 5-3 Fearnley*

Annabel CroftFormer British number one on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds

I'd love to know what is going through Cameron Norrie's mind right now after he was in control of the match. Suddenly things got a little bit more difficult.

He hasn't flinched, he hasn't shown any emotion.

He is trying to absorb it all and keep on bringing the level again.

Norrie 6-3 5-3 Fearnley*

Cameron Norrie needs to stem the momentum Jacob Fearnley is building here and deep first serves like that are just what he needs as he moves into a 40-15 lead.

A backhand winner from Fearnley gives him a sniff but he goes long with a backhand return next point and Norrie holds.

*Norrie 6-3 4-3 Fearnley

Annabel CroftFormer British number one on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds

This is extraordinary, where has this come from?

Suddenly Jacob Fearnley has been given a boost here and he has worked out how to get forward.

He is stamping a bit of authority and he is keeping the shots as short as he can.

*Norrie 6-3 4-3 Fearnley

Advantage Jacob Fearnley and a big first serve sees the 23-year-old hold.

Norrie 6-3 4-2 Fearnley*

Jacob Fearnley plays a couple of winners before being pegged back to 30-30 by Cameron Norrie.

A double fault then offers Norrie break point as Fearnley mutters to himself in frustration.

Fearnley saves it as Norrie is forced into a mistake at the back of the court.

Norrie 6-3 4-2 Fearnley*

Annabel CroftFormer British number one on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds

It will be interesting to see what happens at the end of this second set, whether Jacob Fearnley calls for a trainer.

Norrie 6-3 4-2 Fearnley*

Jacob Fearnley breaks for the first time in this match as Cameron Norrie plods a backhand into the net.

Fearnley closes his eyes and raises both arms in celebration.

Can he build some consistency now?

*Norrie 6-3 4-1 Fearnley

Another break point for Jacob Fearnley but Cameron Norrie saves it with a deep first serve.

The pair trade points before Fearnley brings up a third break point of the game with a backhand winner across court.

*Norrie 6-3 4-1 Fearnley

Cameron Norrie skews a forehand wide - we've not seen that very often in this match.

Jacob Fearnley then sprints around court before playing a cute shot at the net to bring up break point - he didn't look affected by his fitness there.

Norrie saves it with a forehand winner.

*Norrie 6-3 4-1 Fearnley

Annabel CroftFormer British number one on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds

Jacob Fearnley is walking with a stiff leg. He is not even bending his knee. He is cutting a dejected figure and he doesn't look quite right.

I think Cameron Norrie is distracted by what is going on at the other end.

Fearnley hasn't called the trainer which is weird in itself.

*Norrie 6-3 4-1 Fearnley

Something isn't quite right with Jacob Fearnley's body language at the moment - he's not happy with something.

He shrugs it off for now and holds as Cameron Norrie puts a backhand into the net, to finally get on the board in this set.

Norrie 6-3 4-0 Fearnley*

A second break point for Jacob Fearnley in this game and after doing all the hard work to gain control of the point, he puts a backhand into the net.

Fearnley grimaces as he goes wide with a backhand before putting a forehand long and Norrie holds.

Uh oh, Fearnley is walking gingerly now and could have a physical issue - one to keep an eye on.

*Norrie 6-3 3-0 Fearnley

Jacob Fearnley hits some deep shots during a rally but Cameron Norrie has the answers - it's superb defence from him.

Fearnley then sends over a forehand winner which Norrie can do nothing about and we move to a fourth deuce.

*Norrie 6-3 3-0 Fearnley

Annabel CroftFormer British number one on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds

If Cameron Norrie is to go through and potentially face Novak Djokovic, this will be a massive confidence boost in terms of scoreline and energy levels saved.

He is not having to work too hard in this match.

*Norrie 6-3 3-0 Fearnley

Another forehand winner from Jacob Fearnley brings advantage but he spurns it with a backhand that loops wide.

Deuce again.

*Norrie 6-3 3-0 Fearnley

Cameron Norrie is shaking his head at something as Jacob Fearnley works his way to 40-30.

Fearnley then sprints across court to send over a glorious forehand winner down the line for deuce.

Can that inspire Fearnley?

*Norrie 6-3 3-0 Fearnley

Annabel CroftFormer British number one on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds

Jacob Fearnley just cannot get his momentum going to seal back-to-back points.

That game was a real disaster, Fearnley is being completely outplayed.

More confidence is being sapped out Fearnley's racquet.

*Norrie 6-3 3-0 Fearnley

Cameron Norrie brings up another chance for the double break and secures it as Jacob Fearnley spurns a forehand long.

Is Norrie's experience proving the difference here?

He's been so consistent throughout in comparison to his younger British opponent.

Norrie 6-3 2-0 Fearnley*

Jacob Fearnley follows one good shot with a bad one as we move to a fourth deuce.

Fearnley saves break point before serving an ace and then a double fault for deuce again.

Inconsistency has been the story of Fearnley's match so far.

Norrie 6-3 2-0 Fearnley*

Annabel CroftFormer British number one on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds

Jacob Fearnley just needs a little bit of a boost with some good shots.

He needs to try and take Cameron Norrie out of position and build on the sporadic moments that we are seeing.

I think Fearnley is a bit embarrassed whenever he puts in some of these unforced errors.

Jannik Sinner discusses the challenges he has faced at the French Open and the importance of staying focused as matches can turn quickly. (1:29)

PARIS -- When Jannik Sinner's opponent in the French Open's third round finally won a game Saturday, the Court Suzanne-Lenglen crowd responded with a standing ovation. Sinner was simply too good on this day, extending his Grand Slam winning streak to 17 matches and looking very much like the No. 1-ranked man.

Sinner dominated Jiri Lehecka 6-0, 6-1, 6-2 in 1 hour, 34 minutes, the quickest men's match at Roland-Garros this year and, measured by games lost, the most lopsided victory at a major tournament of Sinner's career.

""We try to improve,"" Sinner said. ""Today, I don't think there are many things I can improve.""

He can say that again.

Sinner delivered 31 winners and made only nine unforced errors. He accumulated 18 break points, converting seven, and faced just one, which he saved.

The first 11 games went Sinner's way. When Sinner missed a return wide, making the score 6-0, 5-1 after 55 minutes of action, Lehecka raised his arm and pumped his fist in a bit of sarcastic celebration. The fans went wild, rising out of their seats and clapping and shouting, eliciting a smile from Lehecka.

Make no mistake, though. Lehecka is no also-ran. The 23-year-old from Czechia is ranked 34th and has been a Grand Slam quarterfinalist.

But he was completely overmatched by Sinner, who has won the past two major championships -- at the US Open in September and the Australian Open in January -- and is now the owner of an unbeaten run at the sport's most important tournaments that has been surpassed this century only by a trio of guys by the names of Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

Sinner's bid for a first French Open title, and fourth Slam trophy overall, will continue Monday, when he will face No. 17 Andrey Rublev for a quarterfinal berth. Rublev advanced when his opponent, No. 14 Arthur Fils, withdrew from the tournament because of a stress fracture in his lower back.

American qualifier Ethan Quinn, the 2023 NCAA champion for Georgia, played his second consecutive five-setter and was beaten by Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands 4-6, 6-1, 6-7 (2), 6-1, 6-4. Griekspoor came into the day 0-4 in third-round matches at majors.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"

Coco Gauff needed just two sets to triumph over Marie Bouzková in the third round of the French Open on Saturday. The American sensation swept the opposition, 6-1, 7-6 to advance to the fourth round at Roland Garros.

Gauff established an early lead in the first set before Bouzková appeared to rally back from the deficit. Gauff eventually sealed the deal in the first to head into the second with the lead.

In the second, Bouzková went up 2-0 as Gauff looked to rally back. After Gauff closed the lead to 2-1, Bouzkova kept inching away, going up 3-1. Just when Gauff looked like she was about to drop her first set in the French Open this year, she climbed up to tie the set 5-5.

The thrilling back and forth concluded in dramatic fashion as the world No. 2 successfully rallied back to take the victory.

The 14th seed pulled out of the tournament on Friday before he was set to play Russia's Andrey Rublev.

Rublev will receive a walkover into the last 16 and could next meet world number one Jannik Sinner.

""I have a stress fracture. I had to make a decision and we decided with my team it was better to stop now because it could be for only four to six weeks,"" Fils said on Saturday.

The 20-year-old Fils beat Spain's Jaume Munar in five sets on Thursday but needed treatment for a back problem and also dealt with cramp.

""I had some issue with the back for a long time, and during the match against Munar it gets worse. Then I did some exams. The exams were not good at all,"" he continued.

Fils had said that without the help of the crowd on Court Suzanne Lenglen he was not sure if he could have finished the match against Munar.

""If I was pushing myself too much, I would probably stop for a couple of months,"" he said.

""This is not what we are trying to do, so yeah, had to make a choice.""

Fils said he was still hopeful of playing the third Grand Slam of the year on grass at Wimbledon from June 30, where he reached the last 16 in 2024.

""I'll try to see if I can be ready. I'm not at all sure. It's a big question mark. It will take as long as it takes,"" Fils added.

The Parisian was also forced to retire at the Australian Open in the third round against compatriot Ugo Humbert due to a left ankle injury.

Fils' withdrawal from Roland Garros extends the host nation's wait for a first men's champion at Roland Garros since Yannick Noah in 1983.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","tennis"

Crouching in return position, Jessica Pegula shut her eyes in a meditative state.

That was a brief calm before Pegula's third-set storm.

The third-seeded Pegula sped through the final four games fending off 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 to reach the Roland Garros fourth round.



On match point, Pegula pierced the T with an ace sealing a one hour, 52-minute victory in style.

""Really tough today. I know playing Marketa is always going to be a battle, especially I know we haven't played on clay before,"" Pegula told the media in Paris.""But I know she's had really good results here.

""So was thinking it was going to be really tricky, and it definitely was. It's also super humid today. I felt like it was just a really tough match mentally and physically.""

The third-seeded Pegula joins Amanda Anisimova as the second American woman into this Roland Garros round of 16—and that total may well swell by day's end.

It is Pegula's second French Open fourth round appearance in the last three years.

The 2023 quarterfinalist has the game—and draw—to go deeper.

Next up for Pegula is a fourth-round meeting with French Cinderella story and world No. 361 Lois Boisson.

In a tense clash of French wild cards, Boisson broke three times in a row to edge 138th-ranked Elsa Jacquemot 6-3, 0-6, 7-5 on Court Simonne Mathieu.

US Open finalist Pegula is well aware that match will be played on multiple fronts as she's face both Boisson and a vocal and sometimes rowdy French fan base.

""Obviously, they're going to have some crazy support for them,"" Pegula said. ""I'm pretty good at kind of zoning out. I have played in some pretty rowdy crowds. I think it will be fun.

""It will be cool to be a part of that. Even though they're not for me, it will still be fun. They're going to be going crazy. That will be a fun experience. I don't think I have ever played a French player here, so that will be interesting.""

Should seeds hold true to form, Pegula would play 2024 semifinalist and sixth seeded Mirra Andreeva for a semifinal spot. That is, of course, if Indian Wells champion Andreeva can conquer friend and practice partner Daria Kasatkina, who stopped 10th-seeded Paula Badosa, 6-1, 7-5, earlier today. 

Andreeva permitted just four games overwhelming Yulia Putintseva 6-3, 6-1, to set up the Kasatkina clash of friendly rivals.

""I practiced with her here once already, so I think that we practice together every tournament,"" Andreeva said of Kasatkina. ""It's going to be an entertaining match, for sure, because I think we both know each other very well. So, you know, I think that it's going to be fun and also maybe pretty tight.

""We're going to see, but I think that the match is going to be super interesting.""

A champion for all surfaces—Pegula has won tournament titles on the three major surfaces—the American No. 2 says clay compels her to deploy the variety in her game.

Facing spin doctor Vondrousva, the flat-hitting Pegula mixed in the drop shot and closed net with confidence. Pegula hit 39 winners—11 more than the world No. 96—and won 18 of 33 trips to net.

This match was a rematch of the 2023 Wimbledon quarterfinals and carried added resonance for Pegula.

At SW19, Pegula had a maiden major semifinal within reach.

Then, Vondrousova snatched it away and shattered Pegula's Wimbledon dream.

Down 1-4 in the decider, Vondrousova streaked through five straight games stunning Pegula 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 to reach her first Wimbledon semifinal in a stirring comeback conquest beneath the closed roof of No. 1 Court.

A courageous Vondrousova lashed her lefty forehand with menace pounding 11 of her 24 winners in the final set capping one of the biggest comebacks of her career with tears of joy. Vondrousova went on to defeat Ons Jabeur and win Wimbledon.

So you can't fault Pegula if she experienced a creeping sense of deja vu when Vondrousova broke back for 2-all in the decider.

This time, Pegula played proactive tennis on the slow surface and took it to the talented left-hander.

While Vondrousova dissected Pegula at Wimbledon with slices and drop shots in the final set, at crunch time today, the American turned the tables. Pegula maintained depth on her drives, forced the left-hander to hit her backhand on the run and picked off high volleys with precision.

Competing with clarity at crunch time, Pegula smacked 17 of her 39 winners in the final set, including pumping five of her six aces in the decider. That final ace sent Pegula back to the fourth round with an opportunity to continue this Roland Garros ride.

Arthur Fils has revealed that he could be sidelined for four to six weeks and risks missing Wimbledon after withdrawing from his home Grand Slam tournament. The French No. 1 overcame back issues to beat Jaume Munar in a thrilling four-hour and 25-minute match on Thursday and ripped his shirt off in celebration when he won.

Munar later suggested that Fils wasn't really injured and was only cramping. But the 14th seed announced his withdrawal from the tournament the night before his third-round match against Andrey Rublev. On Saturday morning, he confirmed he had a stress fracture in his back that will leave him in a race against time to return at the All England Club next month.

“I had some issue with the back since a long time, and during the match against Munar it gets worse. Then I did some exams. The exams were not good at all. Got some stress fracture,” Fils said.

“Yeah, whatever, we decide with the team it was better to stop now, because if I'm stopping now, I could stop for only four to six weeks. If I was pushing myself too much, I would probably stop for a couple of months.”

“It's the lower back. I got this issue a couple of times already when I was young. Yeah, L-5. So yeah, I got some issues like this in the past already.”

The 20-year-old explained why his back had caused him so much trouble, adding: “It's an injury that happens quite often when you are a child. It's a stress fracture injury.

“It happened to me twice. I had to wear a back brace. Then it healed. But also, my lower back is arched, so then I had a bone marrow edema. It's coming back right now. So I have to find a way to cure that and to get past that.”

And the stress fracture could now stop him from playing the upcoming grass season. Fils

had entered into grass tournaments in ‘s-Hertogenbosch and Halle to prepare for Wimbledon.

But he has confirmed that he will have to withdraw from some events and Wimbledon - where he reached the fourth round last year - remains up in the air.

The world No. 14 continued: “I have to see with the team, with the doctor. For sure I'm going to skip some tournaments. I don't know which one yet. I will try to be ready for Wimbledon, but we are not sure. To be honest, we don't know. Let's see.

“It's on hold for the moment. It will take time. I'm only 20 years old. I don't want to be in a hurry on the tour. I don't need to ramp up everything. I need to be ready for the hard court season, for the end of the year, and this is for the best.”

Fils received an off-court medical time-out before the fourth set of his second-round clash with Munar on Thursday. Eventually, painkillers and adrenaline kicked in, and the home crowd helped him come back from a break down in the decider to win 7-6 7-6 2-6 0-6 6-4.

“During the match against Munar, at the end of the second set, I said, ‘You know what, I'm going to call the doctor and I'm going to take painkiller',” the Frenchman recalled.

“But then I understood that the back was not good at all, but because of the crowd, I could make it in the fifth. But yeah, then no chance to play.”

But Munar wasn't convinced of Fils' injuries after he won five of the last six games in a row. On Thursday, the Spaniard said: “He was seen by the doctor for a suspected back injury, but I'm convinced he suffered cramps. In that case, he couldn't have been treated.

“I wasn't bothered by the break, but that's the way it is. If you have a real injury, you don't play the fifth set like he did.”

While Fils will be devastated to pull out of his home Grand Slam tournament, the 20-year-old will at the very least be able to watch his beloved PSG in the Champions League final on Saturday night, though he won't be taking a last-minute flight to Munich and will follow it on TV.

Emma Raducanu's clay season ended with a second-round loss at Roland Garros, as defending champion Iga Swiatek proved too strong, brushing the Brit aside 6-1, 6-2. With the French Open behind her, Raducanu has already set her sights on the grass season, eager to build on her growing momentum ahead of her local major, Wimbledon. 

The 22-year-old will open her grass-court season at the Queen's Club Championships, where she has received a wildcard for the tournament's long-awaited WTA return. It's a stacked field, with Jessica Pegula, Elena Rybakina, Naomi Osaka, and Coco Gauff all set to compete in London. 

From there, she heads to Berlin for the German Open, another WTA 500 event with a star-studded line-up that includes Aryna Sabalenka, Madison Keys, and Pegula once again. Raducanu will wrap up her grass-court swing at Wimbledon, which stars on Monday June 30, hoping for a deep run on home soil.

Raducanu's 2025 season has been a story of steady progress, with key wins on the clay helping her climb the rankings. From starting the year outside the top 40 to now sitting at No 37, her form has been building since a strong showing in Miami. The early loss in Paris may have been a setback, but Raducanu also reached the Round of 16 at Rome, losing to Coco Gauff.

Raducanu has made three main draw appearances at Wimbledon, with her best showing coming as a fourth-round finish in her debut in 2021. That remarkable run as an 18-year-old captured the imagination of the British public and set the stage for her US Open triumph later that year. 

She matched her best Wimbledon result in 2024, reaching the fourth round once again. Overall, she holds a 7–3 record at the All England Club, a solid 70% win rate that she will hope to improve this summer.

French Open Star's Wimbledon Dreams in Jeopardy After Controversial Injury Claims

In a shocking turn of events, French tennis sensation Arthur Fils might have to sit out of Wimbledon after being embroiled in a controversy surrounding his recent injury withdrawal from the French Open. The French No. 1, known for his fierce determination on the court, was forced to pull out of his home Grand Slam tournament due to a debilitating back issue, casting doubts on his upcoming participation at the prestigious Wimbledon Championships.

Fils, who valiantly battled through back problems to secure a thrilling victory over Jaume Munar in a marathon match, later faced accusations from his opponent of feigning injury. Munar insinuated that Fils' injury was not genuine, suggesting that the young star was only suffering from cramps rather than a serious back injury. However, Fils silenced the doubters by confirming the presence of a stress fracture in his back, putting his Wimbledon campaign in jeopardy.

The 20-year-old phenom disclosed the severity of his injury, stating, “I had some issue with the back since a long time, and during the match against Munar it gets worse. Then I did some exams. The exams were not good at all. Got some stress fracture.” Fils further elaborated on the recurring nature of his back problems, revealing, “It's the lower back. I got this issue a couple of times already when I was young. Yeah, L-5. So yeah, I got some issues like this in the past already.”

Despite his determination to recover in time for Wimbledon, Fils faces an uphill battle as he navigates his rehabilitation process. The young star, who impressed at Wimbledon last year by reaching the fourth round, acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding his return, stating, “I will try to be ready for Wimbledon, but we are not sure. To be honest, we don't know. Let's see.”

While Fils' withdrawal from upcoming grass tournaments casts a shadow of doubt over his Wimbledon prospects, the tennis world remains captivated by the unfolding drama surrounding the French prodigy. As Fils focuses on his recovery and rehabilitation, fans are left wondering whether he will be able to showcase his talent on the grass courts of Wimbledon this year.

With the tennis fraternity eagerly awaiting updates on Fils' condition and potential comeback, the specter of injury looms large over the promising star's future in the sport. Will Arthur Fils defy the odds and make a triumphant return to Wimbledon, or will his dreams of glory be shattered by the relentless demands of professional tennis? Only time will tell as the tennis world holds its breath in anticipation of Fils' next move.

John and Patrick McEnroe have both had their say on the scheduling of the tennis calendar, coming to a unanimous decision.

Their thoughts were far from unpopular either, echoing the sentiment that so many players have complained about in the last few years.

It feels like as the sport grows the demand on the athletes only increases, pushing these athletes, who are already performing superhuman feats of physical exertion, to new heights.

Eventually, something dangerous will happen, with a few cautionary tales having already emerged.

Fortunately, Patrick has heard something that could ease the burden somewhat.

Speaking live on TNT Sports' US coverage, they took a moment amidst the chaos of Jack Draper's win over Joao Fonseca to discuss the ongoing scheduling problem tennis seems to have.

Alexei Popyrin has complained about the tennis calendar, as has Carlos Alcaraz, and now John McEnroe has echoed their concerns. He claimed: ‘A lot of players, mainly the ones that have lost complaining about the schedule. We've been talking about that for 40-50 years.

‘If they moved the Australian to later, that would give more time, but they don't want to give that up. The January slot. What do you think, in March?'

Patrick McEnroe offered a solution: ‘I'm hearing rumblings that it could move to February.'

‘That would be helpful,' John replied.

However, Pat was not completely optimistic: ‘Of course, there'd probably be another big tournament put in in early January, that's part of potentially the plan. Middle East hello?

‘It's pretty typical of all sports like in the NBA you see players taking nights off under contract. In tennis the difference is you don't play you don't get paid. No guaranteed contracts. Top players have big endorsement deals but even those normally have stipulations that the players have to play certain events or be ranked at a certain spot to collect the money.'

John then ended their chat with a simple message, noting: ‘Players should be able to play when they want, do what's best for themselves.'

As noted earlier, tennis must protect its stars rather than work them harder and harder.

They are the money-makers within the sport, and thus should always be given preferential treatment.

And yet, the stranglehold that the ATP and WTA seem to have over them is strange, thus explaining Novak Djokovic's formation of the PTPA.

A sort of union for players, this marks a big step in the right direction towards lessening the physical turmoil exacted upon the players.

At the moment, they are given just a slender month or so to enjoy some downtime before the season starts right back up again. It's unsustainable, and wholesale changes must be made before it's too late.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

Jannik Sinner put on a clinic at the French Open on Saturday, losing just three games and crushing Jiri Lehecka in 94 minutes to reach the fourth round in Paris.

The top-seeded Italian hasn't dropped a set this week at Roland Garros and lost only nine points on serve in his 6-0, 6-1, 6-2 victory against his Czech opponent.

Sinner also extended his winning streak in Grand Slam matches to 17, including this year's Australian Open and the 2024 U.S. Open.

""I was playing really really well,"" said Sinner, who finished with 31 winners and just nine unforced errors. ""Especially for two and a half sets, then he was serving very well, very brave. He made some good serve and volleys. But I'm very happy.""

Sinner has won 64 consecutive matches against players ranked outside the Top 20 and has advanced to at least the fourth round in 14 of his past 15 majors.

Up next for Sinner is 17th-seeded Russian Andrey Rublev, who advanced in a walkover when Frenchman Arthur Fils withdrew due to injury Saturday.

No. 3 seed Alexander Zverev of Germany struck eight aces and saved three of five break points in a 6-2, 7-6 (4), 6-1 victory against Italian Flavio Cobolli.

Zverev, who lost in the finals last year to Carlos Alcaraz, became just the eighth man in the Open Era to make eight or more consecutive appearances in the fourth round at Roland Garros. He is 37-9 in his career there.

""This court is very special to me,"" Zverev said of Court Philippe-Chatrier. ""I had some of the best memories of my life on this court, but I also had some of the worst memories on this court. It's a love story that hasn't got to the happy end yet, but I hope someday it will.""

Zverev's quest for his first Grand Slam title will continue against the Netherlands' Tallon Griekspoor, who outlasted American qualifier Ethan Quinn 4-6, 6-1, 6-7 (2), 6-1, 6-4.

No. 5 seed Jack Draper of Great Britain reached the fourth round in Paris for the first time with a 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 win against Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca. Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik ousted Portugal's Henrique Rocha 7-5, 6-1, 6-2.

Just one day after news broke of Stefanos Tsitsipas' new partnership with the former No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Goran Ivanisevic, the Greek star publicly shared his excitement.

“I'm happy to begin a new chapter with Goran Ivanisevic joining my team as coach,” Tsitsipas wrote in a statement on Instagram Stories. “Goran's experience, passion for the sport, and champion's mindset are things I greatly respect, and I'm looking forward to the journey ahead with him by my side. I'm optimistic about what we can build together.”

Ivanisevic was a standout player — earning his place in the International Tennis Hall of Fame — and also helped Novak Djokovic to great heights as the Serbian's longtime coach.



The 26-year-old Tsitsipas also thanked coaches Kerei Abakar and Dimitris Chatzinikolaou for their help.

“I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude too Kerei and Dimitris for their dedication, support, and work over the past few months,” Tsitsipas wrote. “Working with them has been a meaningful chapter in my journey, and I'm deeply thankful for the effort and commitment they brought to the team.”

Tsitsipas owns an 18-11 record this season according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He is No. 26 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

Teenager from Geneva is using the ATP Challenger Tour to help make the difficult transition from junior star to full-time pro.ByFlorian HeerPublished May 31, 2025 copy_link

Switzerland has long been a powerhouse in world tennis, with legends like Roger Federer, Stan Wawrinka, and Martina Hingis leaving a lasting mark on the sport. But the future also looks bright, especially on the men's side. While Dominic Stricker, Leandro Riedi, and Jérôme Kym have already made a name for themselves, another young Swiss talent is stepping into the spotlight: Kilian Feldbausch.The 19-year-old from Geneva is considered one of Switzerland's most promising young players. In November 2023, he celebrated his first title on the ITF World Tennis Tour in Boca Raton, a key milestone in his professional journey.“I had just played the South America swing and faced some good players. I came to Florida with good rhythm. Ending the tournament as the winner was obviously great,” Feldbausch said, describing his maiden title on the Pro Circuit.Unlike many of today's power players, Feldbausch relies more on tactical finesse than brute force. “I'm a solid player, not like John Isner with a big serve. I always try to find a solution on the court,” he explained.His goal is clear: to successfully manage the often-difficult transition from junior to professional tennis. And he's already shown that he's up for the challenge. In November 2023, Feldbausch reached his first ATP Challenger Tour final at the eó Hotels Maspalomas Challenger in Gran Canaria.“The Challenger Tour is a big challenge for me. But I like that. You have to be strong physically and mentally,“ Feldbausch said.

Setbacks and ComebackFeldbausch's journey has not been without obstacles. In spring 2023, two foot fractures set him back significantly. Prior to that, he had shown impressive results on the Junior Circuit - reaching the semifinals at the Australian Open, quarterfinals at Wimbledon and the US Open, and climbing as high as World No. 5 in the ITF Junior Rankings.“That was a tough time. I lost almost every match when I came back. But later I was able to regain some confidence,” he said during the Challenger event in the Canary Islands.In April of the same year, he underwent a preventative hip surgery. But by September, he returned to the tour and went on to win a second ITF World Tennis Tour title during the winter in Antalya, Turkey. Now, Feldbausch is aiming for a full, injury-free season.Currently ranked World No. 473, Feldbausch often has to fight his way through qualifying rounds. But he has proven he can rise to the occasion, reaching the main draw at Challenger events in both Santiago de Chile and Menorca, Spain.

Tennis Runs in the FamilyFeldbausch comes from a true tennis lineage. His grandfather, Franz Feldbausch, played Davis Cup for Germany in 1956. His father, Michael, reached a career-high ATP Ranking of 706. His mother, Cathy Caverzasio - now also his coach - was a top WTA player, peaking at World No. 34 in 1990.“Both of my parents coach me. My uncle is also sometimes with me when my mother has to work back home. It helps me a lot to have my family around,” Feldbausch explained.After a challenging year marked by injury and recovery, Feldbausch is now focused and determined. “I played really well toward the end of the 2023 season and of course I want to keep improving.”With a solid foundation, strong family support, and renewed confidence, Kilian Feldbausch seems poised to become a regular presence on the ATP Challenger Tour - and perhaps, in the not-too-distant future, make headlines on the sport's biggest stages.

What the teams said – Qualifying in Spain

Russell reveals the ‘only silver lining' he is taking for Spanish Grand Prix after ‘very bad' run of races

Verstappen keen to ‘see what we can do' from P3 on grid in Spain as he admits McLaren will be ‘tough to beat'

Sainz rues ‘very tricky' Qualifying that left him in the ‘middle of nowhere' at his home GP in Spain

FIA post-Qualifying press conference – Spain

Oscar Piastri set the pace during the final practice session ahead of the Spanish Grand Prix, establishing a commanding gap back to his team mate Lando Norris and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, maintaing McLaren's status as the team to beat.

It was a quiet start to the final hour of practice as Franco Colapinto became the first driver to head out onto the track, looking to recover the time he lost in FP1 with a hydraulic issue and continue to get to grips with the Alpine.

PRACTICE DEBRIEF: Can Red Bull or Mercedes take the fight to McLaren at the Spanish Grand Prix?

He was gradually joined by fellow rookie Gabriel Bortoleto and the Aston Martin duo – Fernando Alonso soaked up the atmosphere of his home race by waving to the crowd around a slow lap that served to scrub his tyres ahead of the more competitive sessions.

Amid slightly cooler track temperatures, Yuki Tsunoda took his Red Bull to the top of the timesheets with a time of 1m 14.851s on a set of medium tyres, but his lap was quickly eclipsed by Norris, who went three-tenths clear.

Practice 3 results

While the Japanese driver reported that he was “sliding a lot”, Carlos Sainz cut the time down even further on his soft tyres as the majority of the field took to the circuit to make the most of the remaining 40 minutes.

A lack of grip similarly irked Max Verstappen, who found himself behind the lead Williams after the initial fast laps. Meanwhile, George Russell demonstrated the potential pace of the red-walled tyres as he was quickest by 0.473s at the halfway mark.

As the action quietened a little, Liam Lawson dipped a wheel over the white line and kicked up some gravel during a flying lap, sending him straight back to the pits – Ollie Bearman replicated the error a short time later while trying to improve from P18.

The final quarter of FP3 saw the drivers focused on Qualifying simulations, and the battle for the top spot was as tense as ever. In an attempt to beat Verstappen's time, Norris had a snap of oversteer and was forced to bail out by driving onto the run-off area, with his race engineer explaining that there was some porpoising at Turn 9.

The frontrunners were unable to beat Piastri's flying lap

His team mate put together a much cleaner lap to clock the fastest time of the weekend so far, once again demonstrating McLaren's mighty pace with a 1m 12.387s, leaving Norris more than half a second adrift.

With just a few minutes left, Verstappen made a final effort to get closer to the Australian on the timesheets, but he was only able to set the fifth-quickest time behind Russell's Mercedes.

At the chequered flag, Isack Hadjar continued his impressive pace with P6 ahead of Kimi Antonelli and crowd favourite Alonso, with Lewis Hamilton and Lawson's Racing Bull rounding out the top 10 in the last session before Qualifying kicks off at 1600 local time.

Ivan Domingues earned his maiden FIA Formula 3 victory, winning the Barcelona Sprint Race and becoming the first driver from Portugal to win in the Championship.

He led home a Van Amersfoort Racing 1-2 ahead of team mate Santiago Ramos, who climbed up to second from eighth on the grid.

PRACTICE DEBRIEF: Can Red Bull or Mercedes take the fight to McLaren at the Spanish Grand Prix?

The race began with a dramatic first couple of corners as the top three on the grid collided at Turn 2, leaving polesitter Roman Bilinski, Martinius Stenshorne and Tim Tramnitz out of the running.

Championship leader Rafael Câmara was also out on the opening lap after hitting the slow-to-getaway Tuukka Taponen at lights out.

Formula 3 Highlights: 2025 Barcelona Sprint Race

After an early Safety Car, Domingues controlled things from the front, keeping Noah Stromsted of TRIDENT just out of DRS range behind him.

In the closing stages, the Mercedes Junior Team driver looked to be in place to mount a fight for the win, but he became another retirement as an issue forced him into the pitlane with a handful of laps to go.

Domingues was able to cruise to his first F3 victory in the end, and a solid drive from Ramos put him on the second step of the podium in the end.

F3: Camara dominates to take fourth pole of 2025 in Barcelona

Nikola Tsolov kept himself out of trouble to take third position for Campos Racing and move himself up to second in the Drivers' Championship ahead of Sunday's Feature Race.

Laurens van Hoepen finished fourth for ART Grand Prix, while Van Amersfoort Racing's strong Saturday was made even better as their third and final car of Théophile Nael rounded out the top five finishers.

FIA post-Qualifying press conference – Spain

Oscar Piastri has grabbed his fourth pole position of the season during Qualifying for the Spanish Grand Prix, the championship leader beating McLaren team mate Lando Norris in the dying moments of the session.

After setting the pace across Q1 and Q2, Piastri lost out to Norris when the opening runs of Q3 took place, the Briton having snatched provisional pole. But it was advantage Piastri as the final flying laps came in, the Australian pumping in a 1m 11.546s to go 0.209s quicker than the other papaya car.

Max Verstappen put in another solid Qualifying performance to slot into third for Red Bull, while Mercedes' George Russell set an identical lap time to the Dutchman but had to settle for fourth after crossing the line later.

Lewis Hamilton was the lead Ferrari in fifth, putting him ahead of Kimi Antonelli in the Mercedes and the other Scuderia car of Charles Leclerc in sixth and seventh respectively. Pierre Gasly, meanwhile, took eighth for Alpine, with Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar again looking strong in ninth while home favourite Fernando Alonso put his Aston Martin in 10th.

Qualifying results

With increasingly fine margins at play, Williams' Alex Albon just missed out on Q3 by three-hundredths of a second, with Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto behind in P12 ahead of the Racing Bulls machine of Liam Lawson. The other cars to exit in Q2 were the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll and Haas' Ollie Bearman.

Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg found himself pushed into the elimination zone during a busy end to Q1, as did Haas' Esteban Ocon. There was also disappointment for Carlos Sainz, the Williams driver exiting the session down in P18.

Franco Colapinto experienced an issue with his Alpine whilst queueing in the pit lane ahead of the final Q1 runs, meaning that he could not improve and ended up in P19.

Yuki Tsunoda, meanwhile, suffered another disappointment as he brought up the rear in P20 for Red Bull, the Japanese driver some way off the pace of his team mate.

Qualifying Highlights: 2025 Spanish Grand Prix

After three busy practice sessions at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, the attentions of the paddock turned to Qualifying. McLaren had set the pace across Friday and Saturday so far – but could any of their rivals pose a greater threat during the rest of the weekend?

The drivers were greeted by increasingly hot and humid conditions as Q1 got underway, with the track temperature hitting 48 degrees while the air temperature held at 29 degrees. Most of the field opted to remain in the garage after the green light appeared, before a flurry of action a few minutes later saw numerous cars head out.

Once all 20 drivers had put a timed lap on the board – all sporting the soft tyre – Piastri repeated his FP3 performance by setting the benchmark, the Australian pumping in a time of 1m 12.551s. This put him two-tenths clear of Verstappen, while Norris was just 0.001s behind the Dutchman in third.

At the other end of the spectrum, the drivers at risk of elimination following the opening runs were Hulkenberg, Ocon, Sainz, Tsunoda and Bortoleto, while Stroll and Lawson found themselves in a precarious position in 14th and 15th respectively.

It was a tough outing for Sainz at his home event

A queue had formed in the pit lane ahead of the final minutes of the session, but there was drama when Colapinto – at the head of the pack – reported an issue, meaning that others behind opted to overtake the Alpine.

It proved to be a frantic dash to the end of Q1 as everybody tried to improve, with Bortoleto impressively hauling himself up into the top 10. Lawson soon did the same, while Bearman and Stroll also bettered their efforts to escape the danger zone.

These improvements pushed Hulkenberg down into P16, and Ocon also missed the cut as he dropped to P17. There was disappointment for Sainz, meanwhile, the Spaniard failing to progress beyond P18.

Colapinto was unable to get going again from the pit lane, resulting in him ending Qualifying down in P19, while another driver to face a nightmarish day was Tsunoda, the Red Bull man having been unable to improve on P20.

Knocked out: Hulkenberg, Ocon, Sainz, Colapinto, Tsunoda

There was disappointment for Tsunoda, who ended the session down in 20th and last place

The action continued at pace as Q2 began, with a number of drivers heading out early on the soft tyres for their first runs. Verstappen initially set the pace before Norris swept through to take P1 with a margin of three-tenths from the Dutchman.

That picture changed again when Piastri went even quicker, the Australian beating his team mate by 0.058s thanks to his lap of 1m 11.998s. Those at risk after the opening runs, on the other hand, were Bortoleto, Lawson, Albon, Stroll and Bearman.

“I'm happy to give Kimi a tow if needed,” fourth-placed Russell commented over the radio, the Briton seemingly wanting to help the other Mercedes car of Antonelli – currently sitting in P9 – to progress through to Q3.

As the session entered into its final minutes, Antonelli was amongst those to return to the track – but there was no sign of Russell, or any of the top five for that matter, as the rest of the field battled to make it through.

Stroll could not improve on his previous effort, nor could Lawson. Elsewhere there was pressure for the other Racing Bulls car of Hadjar – but the Frenchman impressively moved up to sixth. Fellow rookie Bortoleto missed out in P12, while Bearman was also unable to improve.

The other driver out in Q2 was Albon, the Williams driver exiting in P11 after missing the cut by just three-hundredths. The Thai driver voiced his unhappiness about the Haas of Bearman ahead of him as he crossed the line, accusing the American squad of running “purposely slow in Sector 3”.

Knocked out: Albon, Bortoleto, Lawson, Stroll, Bearman

Bearman was amongst those to exit in Q2, the Haas driver ending the session in P15

Following those busy opening phases, it was time for the all-important top 10 shootout in Barcelona – and it looked to be business as usual when Piastri crossed the line to record a 1m 11.836s.

But while the likes of Russell and Verstappen failed to beat the Australian, the other McLaren of Norris surged through to better that effort by 0.017s, going fastest on a 1m 11.819s to secure provisional pole.

While Russell suggested that Mercedes had been “too conservative” after slotting into third – ahead of Leclerc in fourth and Verstappen in fifth – replays showed that Norris had gained a tow from his team mate into the final corner. When warned that Norris would pass him after crossing the line, Piastri dryly commented: “Cheeky”.

Alonso opted to set his effort early during a lull on the track, the Aston Martin driver receiving cheers from his home fans as he moved into fifth. While the Spaniard returned to the pits – and Leclerc stayed in the garage – the rest of the pack headed out for their final flying runs. Could anybody displace Norris at the top?

It turned out that the answer to that was yes, with Piastri putting in a storming lap of 1m 11.546s to go quickest. Norris' subsequent effort was not enough to displace his team mate, the Briton ending up 0.209s adrift after a slightly scruffy outing.

Behind that McLaren front row lockout, Verstappen and Russell set identical times – but the Red Bull man was given third place due to setting his lap first, putting Russell in fourth. Hamilton had a decent session to put his Ferrari in fifth, while Antonelli, Leclerc, Gasly, Hadjar and Alonso completed the top 10 order.

Piastri beat Norris to pole position in Barcelona by 0.209s 

""[I'm] very happy,"" said Piastri. ""It's been a good weekend so far. Didn't start off in the best way, we were struggling a little bit but I think last night we found some pace and today the car's been mega. I feel like I've been able to put in some good laps as well so thank you to the team for all the hard work. This was a pretty miserable scene 12 months ago so to have turned it around in the best way is a great result.”

The lawsuit details a culture on the set of the medical drama in which the assistant prop master, whose boss was his wife, allegedly subjected his employees to sexual comments and groping.


							By 

	Winston Cho



	Former crewmembers on Doctor Odyssey have sued 20th Television and parent company Disney over alleged sexual harassment and retaliation on the set of the medical drama.


	Caroline Mack, Alicia Haverland and Ava Steinbrenner, in a lawsuit filed on Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court, claim they were targets of an “unchecked campaign of sexual harassment” in which their supervisor bombarded them with sexual comments and unwanted touching. They say they were ultimately fired after they complained of the alleged misconduct to management.

	The plaintiffs reported to assistant prop master Tyler Patton, whose supervisor was his wife Tammie Patton. Tyler Patton was previously involved in a lawsuit from a former Universal Network Television employee, who advanced sexual harassment and retaliation allegations on the set of House. In that complaint, the employee Carl Jones claimed Patton groped his genitals and invited women from various production departments to engage in sexual activity.


	The lawsuit details a culture on the set of Doctor Odyssey in which Tyler Patton, who's not named as a defendant in the complaint, and his male colleagues repeatedly commented on their sexual preferences, with the intention of watching women in their orbit react uncomfortably to the commentary.


	In one incident, Tyler Patton allegedly referred to one of the former crewmembers as “mumbles” and told her to “swallow the cum before you talk.” Another involved him asking aloud to other employees why “no one had broke her” yet, the lawsuit claims. He regularly responded to benign statements with “that's what she said,” a sexual joke popularized from The Office, the complaint stated.


	The complaint claims that Tyler Patton regularly texted others pornographic materials, grabbed women crewmembers' butts, placed his arm around their necks and gave lingering hugs.

	











	The lawsuit alleges that Tyler Patton texted the props department, including his wife, prop master Tammie Patton, a link appearing to reference a new story that former President Joe Biden was dropping out of the 2024 presidential race. When they clicked, the crewmembers say they were directed to a webpage showing a naked male with an erect penis. Tyler Patton subsequently walked away and allegedly exclaimed, “If I wasn't fucking the boss, I'd be fired.”


	Mack later reported the incident to the human resources department and her union, which confirmed that 20th Century and Disney were aware of the alleged misconduct, the lawsuit says. This included complaints of the production mishandling replica firearms.


	Tyler Patton was terminated shortly after the complaint was issued, says the lawsuit, which notes that Tammie Patton started to retaliate against the plaintiffs by assigning them demeaning tasks and threatening their employment. The entire props department, outside of Tyler Patton's replacement, was later laid off in response to continuing complaints.


	20th “then almost immediately hired a whole new set of employees to replace Plaintiffs and other Props Department employees for the Dr. Odyssey Season 1 project,” states the complaint. “Clearly, no ‘lay off' had occurred. Instead, Defendants wiped the Prop Department's slate clean to avoid having to deal with any remaining employee-relations issues tied to Tyler Patton's and Tammie Patton's misconduct.”

	











	Since then, the plaintiffs claim they've been blacklisted from working on 20th and Disney productions.


	The lawsuit brings claims for sexual harassment, retaliation, wrongful termination and negligent hiring, among other claims. It seeks unspecified damages.


	20th and Disney didn't respond to requests for comment.


	The first-year drama from 20th and Ryan Murphy Television, starring Joshua Jackson as a cruise-ship physician, remains in limbo as the only current ABC scripted series still awaiting word on its future.

Though we picked it up at a Parisian pharmacy last summer, you don't actually need a plane ticket to get your hands on A313 — here's our honest review.


							By 

	Danielle Directo-Meston


E-Commerce Editor


	If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.


	On a pre-tariff trip to Paris last summer, we dedicated an afternoon to pick up some of the cult-favorite products known for giving the French their je ne sais quois. While we tabled our Polène shopping spree for another time (you'd think there was a Supreme drop based on the line wrapped around the boutique), we did manage to stop by the pharmacies to stock up on sunscreens and skin care not often found on U.S. shelves.


	Among the items we picked up was A313 pommade, a pharmaceutical-grade vitamin A retinoid cream manufactured by Pharma Développement available over the counter at pharmacies in France. This French favorite is known as a “miracle cream” that addresses fine lines, dark spots and acne — and after using it at least three times per week for the past eight months, we can confidently say we've seen smoother, plumper skin with A313 (more on that below).

	Unlike retinoids in the U.S., A313 doesn't require a prescription. In fact, you can now get the very same collagen-boosting formula but with a new, more absorbent texture on sale at Amazon — no plane ticket required. (We stil recommend consulting with your dermatologist before using the product.)


	A 50g tube (or 1.76 oz.) of A313 cost us somewhere between 16 to 18 Euros (or $18 to $20) in France — while that's about half the price at Amazon, it's still a steal compared to the $500 to $800 you'll spend on a plane ticket (don't forget hotels, restaurants and other travel expenses). Another plus in our book? The aluminum tube and plastic cap are easy to recycle.


	The product on Amazon comes directly from the manufacturer, but in English packaging. The active ingredient is 0.12 percent retinyl palmitate, a form of vitamin A that helps to boost collagen production, address hyperpigmentation, reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and smooth the skin's texture. 

	











	The cream we bought in France last year has a consistency similar to Vaseline, but slightly thicker and stickier. However, Pharma Développment says it recently “improved” the texture to “an advanced cream” that's smoother and absorbs quicker than the pomade version. 


	While in Paris, we had to ask a pharmacist to pull A313 for us from behind the counter. We were given clear instructions on how to use it: start with a pea-sized amount once or twice a week, use it only at night, always wear sunscreen and watch for any itching or peeling of the skin and other signs of sensitivity. (Dermatologists also recommend avoiding retinol and retinoids during the summer.)


	We followed the pharmacist's advice to a T, using A313 only at night about three times weekly as the last step in our skin-care routine. Since we started using it over eight months ago, we've seen our sun spots become less noticeable, while our skin feels smoother, bouncier and more hydrated. We have olive combination skin that's on the sensitive side, with some occasional rosacea on our cheekbones. The only irritation we experienced was minor itchiness after applying it over serum that was still wet, so we recommend waiting until your face is completely dry before using A313. (For the record, we're currently using Tatcha's Texture Tonic and The Essence, and Glo by Glen's L'eclat Vitality Elixir.)


	At the pharmacy, we also spent a good 20 minutes grabbing sunscreen from La Roche-Posay, Avène and Nuxe (European and Asian sunscreens are widely known to be more effective); Embryolisse‘s bestselling Lait-Crème Concentré; and drugstore body soaps and lotions (including our new favorite Le Petit Marseillais sweet almond milk body wash). Save for French SPFs, all of these are also available on Amazon — so you're (almost) getting your very own Parisian pharmacy experience at home.

	











	Get A313 while it's still on sale at Amazon for only $38 right here.

Fellow alum and 'White Lotus' creator Mike White has been cast in the upcoming season. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	Despite what fans might have wanted, Boston Rob Mariano wasn't interested in joining the cast of Survivor 50.


	A five-time alum of the beloved CBS series, The Traitors competitor was notably missing from the list of players announced earlier this week who will return to play in the landmark 50th season. However, Mariano revealed that host Jeff Probst “called and asked” him to return but that he was the one to shoot down the offer. 




	“@survivorcbs and @jeffprobst early on they called and asked… I just felt like I have played so many times and I am truly fulfilled with my Survivor journey,” he wrote on Instagram Friday. “I wanted my spot to go to someone else that deserved another chance!”

	Mariano made the post with a collage of photos of himself appearing to look upset with text that read, “Mood after finding out Boston Rob won't be joining ‘Survivor 50' cast.” He thanked fans for “all of your DM‘s and messages” when he wasn't announced as part of the upcoming pool of contestants, which are all competitors from Survivor past. 


	Entitled Survivor 50: In the Hands of the Fans, the landmark season will look much different than past seasons, as the fate of the show's structure was literally placed in the hands of its fans. Viewers were tasked with voting on key elements of the format throughout season 48, including whether or not the game will have idols, if contestants will be supplied with rice and if a live reunion will be filmed in Los Angeles. 


	However, viewers were not given the option of voting for which Survivor players they wanted to join the cast. Instead, alumni like The White Lotus creator Mike White, The Traitors season one winner (and four-time Survivor player) Cirie Fields, season 13's Ozzy Lusth, season 18's Benjamin “Coach” Wade and season 32's Aubry Bracco will be a part of the 50th season. 

	











	“I've gotten so much out of Survivor. It will always be a part of who I am,” Mariano concluded. “I'm eternally grateful. Like I said ..It's gonna be OK. I feel like something good is coming!!!” 


	Aside from the Survivor universe, Mariano recently competed in fellow reality TV competition series, The Traitors. He told The Hollywood Reporter his “reputation” as a legend of the CBS show put a “big target on me,” which led to him being banished during episode seven.

The singer and humanitarian schooled the podcaster on the real world impact of his billionaire friend's DOGE cuts, while Musk fires back on social media. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	U2 frontman schooled podcaster Joe Rogan on his frequent support and defense of Elon Musk. 


	The singer discussed the impact of the Trump administration and Musk's Department of Government Efficiency's proposed cuts to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) — which is considered the largest source of international aid to more than 120 countries via delivering food programs, clean water and infectious disease medical assistance. The organization's efforts are often credited for saving lives at the cost of pennies on the dollar.

					Bono Weighs in on Trump-Bruce Springsteen Drama: ""There's Only One Boss in America""		
			









Bono has been undertaking humanitarian trips to Africa and other nations since the early 1980s and has a history of working with USAID. He cited a study that estimated the DOGE cuts to the department will result in more than 300,000 deaths worldwide — more than 200,000 of them children suffering from malnutrition, malaria and pneumonia. The cuts, he claimed, have already resulted in food, water and medical aide being stranded due to mass layoffs.


	“There's food rotting in boats and warehouses,” Bono said during a Friday appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience (video clip below). “There is 50,000 tons of food. The people who knew the codes — who were responsible for distributing that aid — were fired. That's not America, is it?”


	Bono said he understands why people would want to downsize big government but says steep cuts to the popular charity program already have disastrous consequences.


	“To destroy, to vandalize, it felt like with glee, that these life support systems were being pulled out of the walls,” Bono says, and cited a story in Christianity Today: “[One aide worker said], ‘We don't have the funds, we have to choose which child to pull off the IVs.' It just seems to me, I don't know if ‘evil' is too strong a word, but what we know about pure evil is that it rejoices in the deaths, in the squandering of human life — particularly children. It actually rejoices in it. And whether it's incompetence, whether it's unintended consequences, it's not too late for people.”

	











	Bono added that he has even attempted to address the issue with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who the singer says is “convinced people aren't dying yet.” 


	Rogan pushed back, calling USAID a “money-laundering operation” that has lost even a “trillion” with “no oversight, no receipts.” 


	There has indeed been credible accusations of waste and fraud within the organization (some reading here and here). But such instances are estimated to be a tiny fraction of the organization's $40 billion budget. Nonetheless, the Trump administration put most USAID workers on leave in February amid Musk declaring it a “criminal organization” and that it was “time to die.” 


	That said, Rogan added, “But also, we help the world and when you're talking about making wells for people in the Congo to get fresh water, when you're talking about food and medicine to places that don't have access, no way that should have been cut out. And that should have been clear before they make these radical cuts. There's got to be a way to keep aide and not have fraud.” 


	Rogan added, “The ironic thing is, even though Elon Musk has proposed all these things and the DOGE committee has proposed all these things, they've made no cuts in terms of the budget. They've cut nothing.” 


	Musk posted a clip of Bono and fired back on X: “He's such a liar/idiot. Zero people have died!” 


	Musk and Rubio's insistence that no one has yet died could be referring to the fact the 300,000 deaths report is a prediction of the number of deaths rather than saying those deaths have already occurred. 

	











	In the Christianity Today story that Bono cited, workers on the ground said there have already been cuts to funding and suggested children would begin dying soon. One aide worker said, “I do think we can expect to see increased mortality rates, increased infection, and increased despair if things aren't corrected.” Also, Bono's quote cited about pulling children off IVs was indeed a prediction rather than a current statement of fact. But according to Brooke Nichols — the mathematician and professor of infectious diseases at Boston University who created the prediction model — tens of thousands likely have already died.


	“Because I've been doing HIV [research] for so long, I just assumed that would be where the biggest impact would occur,” Nichols told The Times UK. “But I was really shocked by the child deaths from diarrhea, pneumonia and malnutrition. Tens of thousands of children have died because we've pulled out our funding from diarrhea, pneumonia and food programs.”


	The bottom line seems to be: Humanitarian workers say the Trump administration's actions are already having a dire impact on the ground, but there is some debate over how many deaths, if any, have already occurred. All experts seem to agree the proposed cuts (which reportedly will reduce USAID spending by 80 percent) will be devastating and cause hundreds of thousands of deaths if fully implemented and/or more time passes without the administration changing course.


	Previously, Bill Gates similarly chastised Musk for the cuts to The Financial Times, saying, “The picture of the world's richest man killing the world's poorest children is not a pretty one.” 

	











	The news comes amid Musk stepping down from his official White House role and a New York Times report that claimed the billionaire took copious amounts of ketamine and other drugs during his time running DOGE. Musk has called the report “bs” and said the number of meetings and photographs he was in would make such use impossible.


	During the podcast, Bono further warned against the Trump administration's isolationist impulses in general.


	“I just want to remind Americans of the size of their country, and I'm not talking about the geography,” Bono said. “The size of the idea, it's just an extraordinary thing. It's an idea big enough to fit the whole world, and when it becomes an island rather than a continent … when it shrinks, America seems to stop being America.” 

NEW: Joe Rogan sets the record straight after Bono claimed 300,000 people have died because of DOGE.“[USAID] was a money laundering operation… there's no oversight, no receipts. There is a lot of fraud, a lot of money laundering.”pic.twitter.com/KX2iHjeoHA

Diljit Dosanjh will be a special speaker at the event, which will launch at NXNE in Toronto's TIFF Lightbox on June 11, 2025.


	The record-setting artist made history with his Dil-Luminati tour last year, with his stadium concerts at Vancouver's BC Place and Toronto's Rogers Centre going down as the biggest ever Punjabi music events outside of India. The musician and movie star has continued to spread Punjabi culture worldwide, recently bringing historic fashion to the Met Gala.


	At the summit, Dosanjh will sit down for a special interview with another influential figure in the international music industry: Panos A. Panay, president of the Recording Academy, the organization behind the Grammys.


Billboard Canada has also announced two big performers for The Stage at NXNE. 


Daniel Caesar is returning to where he played his first major headlining show: The Mod Club in Toronto on June 14.

	The venue will be reverting back to its original name of The Mod Club, rebranded by owner Live Nation from the name Axis Club for the first time since 2021.


	When he first played the venue, Caesar was a golden boy with a golden voice, gaining buzz with his EP Pilgrim's Paradise and still a year away from his classic 2017 debut, Freudian.


	In 2023, Caesar graduated to arenas, playing Madison Square Garden in New York and Scotiabank Arena in his hometown of Toronto. The Mod Club performance is a special, intimate show for his fans who have been with him from the beginning. A year after he played The Mod Club in 2017, Caesar also played NXNE — then an up-and-coming talent, and now, with the festival turning 30, an artist who has reached undeniable headliner status.


	After the last girls have left the party for their special DJ set on June 12, The Beaches will also play a special concert at a well-known Toronto venue on June 15.


	It's a big summer for the breakout Canadian band, with a recent festival set at Coachella and another big one this summer at Osheaga in Montreal. The Beaches' new album, No Hard Feelings, comes out Aug. 29 on AWAL.


	The band has also just announced the Canadian dates on its No Hard Feelings Tour, including its first hometown arena show at Scotiabank Arena on Nov. 6. The Beaches' special Billboard Canada Live show will be considerably more intimate, a chance to get up close and personal with the band at a surprise venue. – Richard Trapunski


	Quebec may soon be getting stricter language regulations on streaming services.


	Quebec Culture Minister Mathieu Lacombe tabled a new bill on May 21 that aims to add more French-language content to major streaming platforms, as well as increase its discoverability and accessibility by establishing quotas. The bill will directly impact platforms that offer media content such as music, TV, video and audiobooks, including giants like Netflix and Spotify.


	Lacombe wants to push French-language and Quebecian content to the forefront on these apps, saying it is not always readily available. He pointed out that consumption of local and French-language content is low, comprising just 8.5% of the music streamed in Quebec.


	In accordance with the bill, platforms would have to display their default interfaces in French within the province, also including platforms that produce original French-language content within that selection. Companies that disobey the rules could face financial penalties, although Lacombe says that those who cannot comply due to their business model can enter a deal with the Quebec government to establish “substitute rules.”


	The bill states that the Quebec government would have to establish content proportions or quotas on how much content needs to be produced or featured on these platforms, although no numbers were specified.


	Bill 109 — officially titled “An Act to affirm the cultural sovereignty of Quebec and to enact the Act respecting the discoverability of French-language cultural content in the digital environment” — will be closely tied to existing Quebec legislation and institutions. All platforms will be required to register with the Minister of Culture and Communications, and the bill will amend the right to access French-language cultural content in the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms.


	While Quebec is tightening regulations, the streaming services are already pushing back against existing content policies, arguing that the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) should not impose content obligations upon them. A CRTC hearing is currently underway from May 14 to 27 to outline a new definition of Canadian Content (CanCon), including regulations.


	Major companies have been pushing back against the CRTC's implementation of the Online Streaming Act in the hearing, which includes a plan to require major foreign streaming companies to invest in Canadian Content funds. – Stefano Rebuli

Según Nationals Park, ""la producción completa de la gira de Shakira no puede ser transportada a Washington, D.C. a tiempo"".

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	El concierto de Shakira programado como parte del evento de bienvenida al WorldPride en Washington, D.C. se suspendió el viernes (30 de mayo), un día después de que se cancelara su show en Fenway Park en Boston.


	La noticia se compartió en las redes sociales de Nationals Park, el estadio de los Washington Nationals de las Grandes Ligas.


	“Por las complicaciones del show anterior en Boston, la producción completa de la gira de Shakira no puede ser transportada a Washington, D.C. a tiempo para su presentación programada en Nationals Park el sábado 31 de mayo”, dice el comunicado del estadio. “Como resultado, el show en D.C. ha sido cancelado. A pesar de todos los esfuerzos por hacerlo posible, no se puede seguir adelante según lo planeado”.

	El comunicado indica que los reembolsos serán “emitidos automáticamente para las compras realizadas a través de Ticketmaster y Nationals.com”, mientras que quienes compraron boletos a través de revendedores terceros deberán contactar directamente al punto de compra.

	











	En una declaración inicial compartida en las redes de Nationals Park, Shakira expresó su tristeza por la cancelación: “Debido a circunstancias fuera de mi control, estoy triste y con el corazón roto por no poder estar en Washington, D.C. con ustedes mañana. Espero poder regresar a D.C. tan pronto como me sea posible. Mientras tanto, sepan que estoy eternamente agradecida por su apoyo incondicional”. Sin embargo, esta declaración ha sido eliminada de las cuentas de Nationals Park y no aparece en los canales oficiales de la artista.


	El show de Shakira programado para la noche del jueves en el Fenway Park de Boston fue cancelado solo unas horas antes de su inicio “debido a circunstancias imprevistas”, según anunció el estadio en sus redes sociales. Más tarde, Live Nation dijo a Billboard en un comunicado: “Durante una revisión de rutina previa al show, se identificaron elementos estructurales que no cumplían con los estándares, por lo que los shows fueron cancelados. Todo el equipo está a salvo”.


	A pesar de la cancelación del concierto de bienvenida al WorldPride, el sitio web oficial de WorldPride D.C. asegura que todos los demás eventos programados continuarán según lo planeado. Encuentra el programa completo aquí.


	La próxima parada de la gira mundial de Shakira Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran World Tour está programada para el lunes en el State Farm Arena de Atlanta.

	Three former members of the props department on ABC‘s medical drama Doctor Odyssey filed a lawsuit Friday against the network's parent company Disney and producer 20th Television, alleging they were subject to sexual harassment on the set of the series and eventually retaliated against and terminated when they complained about it.


	The suit, filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court, says the plaintiffs — Caroline Mack, Alicia Haverland and Ava Steinbrenner — were hired in late spring/early summer 2024 to work in the new series' props department. The defendants then hired Tammie Patton as Prop Master and her husband Tyler Patton as Assistant Prop Master who supervised and directed the plaintiffs in their work.

	











	The suit claims the props department “was an unlawful den of sexual harassment and retaliation,” and that the plaintiffs were subject to “an an unchecked campaign of sexual harassment for months” by “Taylor Patton and his male buddies.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Reps for Disney and 20th TV declined comment. 


	The behavior cited in the lawsuit (read it here) allegedly included “sexual jokes, innuendos, comments, sexual gestures and images, and unwanted touching including, but not limited to: (i) regularly giving Plaintiffs unwanted, lingering hugs; (ii) touching one of the Plaintiff's thighs; (iii) frequently placing his hands on one of the Plaintiff's lower back; (iv) placing his arms around Plaintiffs' necks and forcing them to “walk with him;” and (v) openly grabbing a visiting female employee's buttocks on set.”


	The suit said the plaintiffs eventually went to senior production members to report the misconduct including Tammie Patton, and say they were retaliated against by being forced to do demeaning tasks, and having their jobs threatened.


	“Even though Defendants' Human Resources Department and Senior Management assigned to Dr. Odyssey were fully aware of Tyler Patton's inappropriate behavior and the retaliation his wife/Plaintiffs' boss Tammie Patton engaged in, they took no action to prevent it,” says the suit. “In fact, Defendants' human resources was asleep at the wheel and permitted the frustrated managers/producers on set to handle these conflicts on their own. This led to Plaintiffs suffering additional mistreatment, retaliation, and emotional distress.”

	











	In the end, the plaintiffs say that rather than taking action against the alleged harassers, the defendants informed the entire props department in August that it was being terminated. That became effective at the end of September.


	“Defendants took the ‘easy' way out choosing to eliminate not only the wrongdoers — Prop Master Tammie Patton and Assistant Prop Master Tyler Patton — but all of the remaining employees in the Props Department who had been subject to the wrongdoers' misconduct,” the suit says.


	As a result, the plaintiffs are claiming wrongful termination in addition to claims of sexual harassment, failure to prevent harassment and retaliation.


	The suit also cites negligent hiring on the part of Disney, Fox and co-defendant Entertainment Partners, saying the defendants knew Tyler Patton had been subject to similar accusations and lawsuit on the set of the mid-2000s Fox medical drama series House. “Notably, there was some overlap between employees on Dr. Odyssey and employees on the set of House,” the suit says.


	The plaintiffs are seeking a jury trial.


Doctor Odyssey, from Ryan Murphy and starring Joshua Jackson and Don Johnson, debuted its first season in September and is on the bubble for a Season 2 pickup. It was not on ABC's fall 2025 schedule when that was announced earlier this month at the broadcast upfronts.

	The Diddy trial is still unfolding, but Bill Maher believes it has already shown that a “new rule” should be imposed for sexual assault cases nearly eight years after the start of the #MeToo movement. 


	In his end-of-show monologue on Real Time Friday (watch it above), Maher used the prosecution of Sean “Diddy” Combs as a prism for how sexual misconduct is viewed in society and in the justice system. “A lot has changed” since the initial wave of allegations against Harvey Weinstein and many others in 2017, he maintained.


	“We need to keep two thoughts in our head at the same time: One, Diddy is a bad dude – really bad. Like, the worst thing in rap since Hammer pants. A violent, sick f–k – I'm sorry, an alleged violent, sick f–k. And we should lock him up and throw away the baby oil,” Maher said. “And two, things have changed enough that moving forward, the rule should be, if you're being abused, you've got to leave right away.”

	The host pointed out what he sees as inconsistencies in the testimony of Cassie Ventura, Diddy's former girlfriend.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“It's not victim-shaming to expect women to have the agency to leave toxic relationships. Quite the contrary, to not expect that is infantilizing,” Maher said. “If Diddy walks free, it will because his lawyers can point to an endless stream of texts from Cassie expressing what's often called ‘enthusiastic consent' to their sex life. If you're ‘MeToo-ing' someone, it's not helpful to your case if you texted him, ‘me too!'”


	A graphic on the screen next to Maher displayed text messages from Ventura to Combs presented at trial, including one that read, “I'm always ready to freak off.”


	Years ago, “when women felt, for good reason, that ‘OG predators' like Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein would never be held accountable, why not at least get something out of it?” Maher said. Most of the initially accused perpetrators were surrounded by “all sorts of enablers” (assistants, cops, agents, “cowards” afraid to defy the person signing their paycheck), Maher recalled. In that era, “it was not illogical for an abused woman to say, ‘Well, if I can't get justice for my pain, can I at least get a receipt? A coupon?'”

	











	Maher did acknowledge, “as counter-intuitive as it seems, why an abused woman would send complimentary text.” Unlike in past eras, though, he argued, “We're not in the ‘no one listens to women or takes them seriously' era anymore. Operators are actually standing by to take your calls.”


	Statistics show more women have reported claims of abuse and mistreatment over the past seven-plus years, Maher pointed out.


	“I understand why it can be difficult for women to leave an abusive relationship,” he said. “But this should be society's new grand bargain. We take every allegation seriously, but don't tell me anymore about your contemporaneous account that you said to two friends 10 years ago. Tell the police right away. Don't wait a decade. Don't journal about it. Don't turn it into a one-woman show. And most importantly, don't keep f–king him. Your only contemporaneous notes about what he did should be a police report.”


	The show-business sparkle of the music business also can't be eliminated from the Diddy situation or others that have played out in Hollywood, Maher continued. “If we're going to have an honest conversation about abuse, we also have to have an honest conversation about what people are willing to do for stardom. If you want a No. 1 record so bad you'll take a No. 1 in the face, some of that is on you,” he said. “And if you're doing it for love, well, c'mon, Oprah and Dr. Phil and every podcaster in the world by now have done a million shows about ‘abuse is not love' and ‘abusers don't change.'”


	R&B singer Ike Turner “was a psycho, just like Diddy,” Maher said. “But in an era when there was no movement to help her, Tina Turner somehow got away and she did it with 36 cents in her pocket and a mobile card.”

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SATURDAY AM: It's a solid weekend following the Memorial Day holiday with all titles driving around $144M worth of business, +117% from the post-holiday doldrums a year ago. Let's rejoice and take it. 


	No, it's not the biggest for the post 4-day holiday during post pandemic times — that belongs to 2023 when Sony's all-pleasing fanboy animated movie, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse led all titles to a $205M+ marketplace. However, out of 22 weekends in 2025, only ten of 'em have grossed north of $100M-plus. Let's be pleased. I'm sure those novelty popcorn buckets at the circuits are still flying off counters. 

	











	Disney's Lilo & Stitch is still on track for a $60M-$64M second weekend, Paramount's Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning is showing that Imax makes a difference in weekend 2 with a -58% hold and $26.7M, and Sony's Karate Kid: Legends…the studio is forecasting $21M-$23M opening off a $7.5M Friday. Rivals see it lower in the high teens, however, as we said yesterday, it boils down to Saturday business and whether that tips more families into both Karate Kid, and Lilo & Stitch toward the higher end of its range. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	There is a bit of overlap between the two films demo wise, even though Lilo skews more female at 62% and Karate Kid: Legends more male at 59%. Their men under 25 demos are close (Legends is 22% to Lilo‘s 18%) and their women over 25 as well (Legends is 30% and Lilo 34%). Yes, of course, substantially more moms are taking kids to see Lilo.

	











	Net production cost on Karate Kid: Legends was $45M before P&A. It will be interesting to see how big overseas is. The franchise was born at a time in 1984 before studios relied on overseas. With Jackie Chan in the 2010 reboot, the foreign box office on that movie edged out domestic, $182.5M to $176.5M and that's without China, however, Japan made a great $17.4M. 


	Men over 25 for Karate Kid were 37% and women under 25 the lowest turnout at 11%. Best grades for the crossover comes from women over 25 with 95%. Diversity demos were 36% Caucasian, 31% Hispanic and Latino, 16% Asian American and 12% Black.


	Great exits though for Karate Kid: Legends with an A- CinemaScore, the same grade as the 1986 sequel, Karate Kid II. The 2010 Chan version landed an A. Of course, the biggest reason on Screen Engine/Comscore's PostTrak why people bought tickets to Legends is because it's part of a franchise they love (46%). Also interesting to note that of all the moviegoers going to see Karate Kid: Legends, 68% of them said they have Netflix as their leading streaming service. That's where Sony's output deal is in the pay-one, and it's also where Cobra Kai lives. 


	A24's Bring Her Back after a $3.1M Friday is looking at $7M-$8M in 5th place. For horror films, especially an A24 one, which typically divides audiences, the movie, wow, landed a B+ CinemaScore. Also, four stars and 80% positive and a 57% definite recommend. High praise. Hopefully that all works in the film's favor throughout this weekend and leg-wise. Thirty one percent of those who bought tickets said they went because it's a Philippou twins movie, and 48% said it's because it's a horror movie.


	Men over 25 mostly turned out at 42%, as well as women over 25 at 28%, with an even amount of men and women under 25 at 15% apiece. Diversity demos were 50% Caucasian, 23% Latino and Hispanic, 14% Black and 9% Asian American. Most influential forms of advertisement for Bring Her Back was social media at 21% per those polled by PostTrak which isn't surprising as it's an A24 movie, and that's where they focus most of their P&A spend. Those polled also said buzz from friends/family was influential (15%) as well as the in-theater trailer (14%). Social media universe across TikTok, Instagram, etc. was 50M per RelishMix, which is ahead of Hereditary (44M) before opening and just under NEON's Cuckoo (53M, $3M opening). 


	Positive word of mouth that RelishMix spotted included fans of the Philippou's Talk to Me, as well as excitement over their trailer, some horror fans remarking that the movie looks like a throwback to 1989's Pet Sematary.

	A24 financed the movie for around $20M I hear, with foreign rights sold going to Sony for around $13M, I understand.  


	Also, as expected, Focus Features' Wes Anderson movie, The Phoenician Scheme, is heading toward the best theater average of 2025 year to date with $95K from six NYC and LA theaters. Not as high as the director's Asteroid City two years ago ($142,2K), but robust enough for the specialty sector post pandemic which is desparate for dollars. 3-day looks like $570K in 12th place. The Angelika in NY led all theaters with $78K yesterday where they had a premium $62 ticket that included an “Immersive Experience” and popcorn. AMC Lincoln Square did $63K, LA's AMC Century City posted $38K, AMC The Grove a similar take, AMC Burbank $31.3K and Alamo Brooklyn was around $23K. Muy bien.

	Notables: 


The Phoenician Scheme (Foc) 6 theaters, Fri $270K, 3-day $570K, PTA $95K, Wk 1 


FRIDAY AFTERNOON: Disney's Lilo & Stitch is coming in right where we were seeing it — at $60M in weekend 2, -59%, at 4,410 locations. That hold is similar to that of the second weekend of Little Mermaid, which was also a Memorial Day theatrical release. Today looks like $17M for Lilo‘s second Friday, -70%. Running total for the Dean Fleischer Camp directed movie by Sunday is $277M. 


	However, Sony's Karate Kid: Legends is looking lighter than forecasts with a $20M opening after a $7M-$8M Friday that includes previews in 3,809 theaters. That would put the Ralph Macchio and Jackie Chan team-up in third place behind Paramount's second weekend of Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning, with a $7.7M second Friday and $27.3M second weekend, -57% at 3,861. That's better than Dead Reckoning‘s second weekend decline of -65% sans Imax screens. Running total for the Christopher McQuarrie directed, Tom Cruise title by Sunday looks like $122.6M. 


	The anticipation is that Saturday will work in both Lilo and Karate Kid: Legends‘ favor.


	Fourth is New Line's Final Destination: Bloodlines with $2.8M today at 3,134 and a third weekend of $10M, -48%, for a running total by Sunday of $110.9M.


	Fifth is A24's Bring Her Back with $3M today (including previews), and $6M-$7M for the weekend at 2,409 sites.   


	Even if Karate Kid: Legends comes in less than expected, we are in far better shape than a year ago when the post Memorial Day weekend only did $66M per Box Office Mojo (there weren't any major studio releases and Garfield Movie led with a second weekend take of $14M). The top five movies this weekend (at the high end) are already grossing north of $124M.


PREVIOUS FRIDAY AM: Sony's Karate Kid: Legends grossed $2.3M from previews that began at 2 p.m. Thursday.


	The PG-13 movie is a vortex of old school and new school: Ralph Macchio's Daniel-san, Jackie Chan's Mr. Han and, shhhhh, the Cobra Kai gang (I mean, is it really a secret?). Forecast for the movie is $25M-$30M in a marketplace where Disney's Lilo & Stitch is overpowering with a potential $60M second frame. Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning also is hoping to hold with those Imax screens, around $32M or less.

	











	Critics like this Karate Kid a little less than the 2010 Chan one, 55% Rotten vs. 67% fresh. Karate Kid: Legends received 4 stars on PostTrak and a 68% definite recommend from definite audiences, 4 1/2 stars from parents and a 63 definite recommend, and kids under 12 with 4½ stars and a 79% must-see right away. Boys ages 10-12 at 64% made up the majority of the under-12 set; that demo is an essential portion of the Cobra Kai cult. Overall, men showed up at 60% last night.


Karate Kid: Legends‘ Thursday night is just ahead of the $1.9M that Sony/Alcon's The Garfield Movie reboot made last May before a Friday of $8.4M and 3-day of $24M.


Karate Kid: Legends was made for $45M net before P&A; that's $5M more than the 2010 version cost (unadjusted for inflation). The Karate Kid franchise is 41 years old and counts $620M at the global box office from five previous movies; the bulk of that figure is from the Chan/Jaden Smith version 15 years ago, which made $359M worldwide.


	A24's Danny and Michael Philippou horror movie Bring Her Back made $850K in previews at 2,409 theaters that began at 4 p.m. Thursday. That figure is just under A24's fall sleeper Heretic, which made $1.2M in previews starting at 7 p.m. before turning into a $4.3M Friday and $10.8M opening. The Philippou twins' previous A24 movie, 2022's Talk to Me, opened to $10.4M. A good definite-recommend from the fanboy crowd last night for Bring Her Back at 58%, with women over 25 giving the movie its best positive score at 83%. The Thursday crowd was male-heavy at 57% to female's 43%. Women overall enjoyed it more than the guys, 83% to 77%. Go Sally Hawkins. The pre-weekend outlook is $5M-$7M. On Rotten Tomatoes, Bring Her Back has been stamped with 88% certified fresh. No audience score yet.


Lilo & Stitch ends its first week with $217M at 4,410 theaters, after $9.2M yesterday, -9% from Wednesday. The pic's first week is 15% behind that the $255M for  Inside Out 2, which ended its run at $652.9M, and it's 9% behind Moana 2‘s first seven days of $239.3M (final $460.4M). No, we're not saying the movie is doing badly, we're just trying to give you an idea of where Lilo & Stitch lives. While no one is forecasting this for Lilo & Stitch, sometimes these fan-fave Disney movies can go into overdrive, i.e. Inside Out 2 owns the best second weekend ever for a PG movie of $101.2M. And nobody saw that coming…


Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning ends its first week with an estimated $95.3M at 3,857, which is 7% ahead of the first week of 2018's Mission: Impossible – Fallout ($220.1M final domestic) and 4.7% ahead of the first seven days of 2022's Dead Reckoning (final domestic B.O. was $172.6M).


	The rest of the top 5 for the week:


	3. Final Destination Bloodlines (WB/NL) 3,523 theaters, Thu $1.85M (-13% from Wed), Week $30.7M (-56%), Total $100.9M/Wk 2It was the highest grossing of the franchise out of the gate. Nothing in its way.


	4. Thunderbolts* (Dis) 3,180 theaters, Thu $765K (-10%), Wk $14.8M (-36%), Total $177M/Wk 4


	5. Sinners (WB) 2,632 theaters, Thu $880k (-15%), Wk $14.06M (-37%), Total $261.8M/Wk 6

	British actor and comedian Ricky Gervais celebrated Friday, receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.


BBC News reports that Gervais said he was “humbled” to have his star in a place that “celebrates the dreamers and doers of the industry,” and that his success was a mix of “luck, persistence, and a little bit of pushing against the tide.”


	Gervais said he was initially nervous about receiving the accolade, believing he'd have to get down on all fours and put his hands in concrete: “I thought, I won't get back up and that will be embarrassing. But I don't have to do that. Me standing her now is as embarrassing and awkward as it gets.”

	











	The Walk of Fame producer Ana Martinez said: “Finally, a star that will give snarky commentary every time someone walks by… I always knew we needed a comedian's touch on our famed sidewalk.”

	Gervais has enjoyed huge success both in the UK and the US. His original BBC comedy The Office which he co-wrote and starred in was adapted into a long running US version starring Steve Carell, and he also created the Netflix hit comedy drama After Life.


	He is equally well-known for his string of stand-up comedy specials, and for his ruthless barbs at A-list guests while hosting the Golden Globe Awards on five occasions.

A May 30, 2025 Hollywood Reporter report announced that M*A*S*H actress Loretta Swit has died. She was 87 years old. Read on to get the details about her family, relationship status, and what will become of her net worth.

According to an IMDb biography, Swit married fellow actor Dennis Holahan in 1983. The UPI archives have the text of the couple's original wedding announcement from December of that year, which says they met while filming an episode of M*A*S*H and hopped a flight to Egypt for their honeymoon.

The wedding was a small, intimate one, according to the announcement. Swit's spokeswoman at the time, Dawn Davis, called it a “small church ceremony.” The short rundown revealed that a reception took place in Beverly Hills and was attended by “a number of celebrities.” It also shared that Swit and Holahan planned to call the Hollywood Hills their home.

According to CBC, Swit was divorced from Holahan at the time of her death. The outlet's report on her passing says she and her husband split in 1995.

Swit did not have any known children, and it is not immediately clear where her assets will go. According to the Hindustan Times, the TV star's net worth was around $4 million at the time of her death. At the time of publishing, public information about her will could not be found.

A USA Today report details the touching tributes Swit's M*A*S*H costars released in her honor. Alan Alda, who portrayed the character known by the nickname “Hawkeye,” penned an X post remembering the effort Swit put into her role. 

“She worked hard In showing the writing staff how they could turn the character from a one joke sexist stereotype into a real person — with real feelings and ambitions. We celebrated the day the script came out listing her character not as Hot Lips, but as Margaret. Loretta made the most of her time here,” he wrote.

The outlet says Jamie Farr, another actor from the show, directly gave them a statement which read in part, “”From the first time I met her, on what was supposed to be a one-day appearance on “M*A*S*H,” we embraced each other.” He also declared that he “dearly loved” his late costar, and called their relationship “a lifetime friendship.” He wrapped up his statement by saying, “I can't begin to express how much she will be missed.”

After a decade at the helm of “NBC Nightly News,” veteran news anchor Lester Holt has signed off from the broadcast with heartfelt messages both FROM him and TO him.

Holt kicked off the May 30 episode by calling his time anchoring Nightly News “the honor of a lifetime.”

“After 10 years at Nightly News, it's my final broadcast — from Paris to Tokyo, Uvalde to Ukraine, the greatest generation to the wild blue yonder, the news we've covered, the people we've met and the stories we've told. Your stories. My gratitude to all of you on this special night,” he said.

Holt announced his departure in February, saying he will turn his full focus to prime time news program “Dateline NBC.” Holt has been part of “Dateline” since 2011. But he says he wants to “dive deeper” into investigative projects and long-form storytelling.

A post shared by NBC Chicago (@nbcchicago)

Lester Holt's son, NBC Chicago anchor Stefan Holt, shared a special goodbye to his dad.

In a video NBC Chicago posted to its Instagram account, Stefan says, “Hey Dad, greetings from Chicago. This is really hard to believe… it's your last broadcast on ‘Nightly News,' and as you get ready to say farewell, I just want to say thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, not only for being the kind of father that every kid hopes for, but also for being the kind of mentor that every journalist dreams of, for all the critiques, the career advice, for all those years letting me hang out behind the scenes at 30 Rock trying to soak it all in.”

The 38-year-old went on, “I could not be more proud of your journey and all that you have done from anchoring here in Chicago to traveling to every hotspot around the world to spending 10 years on the desk of ‘NBC Nightly News. I know it didn't come without sacrifice, but I also know deep down that it was worth it, and I'm grateful for all that you have done as a journalist and as a dad. I hope this next chapter with ‘Dateline' is filled with as much contentment and hopefully a little more time to come hang out with Morgan and I and the grandkids here in Chicago.”

Stefan ended his message saying, “Dad, congratulations on your final broadcast. I love you.”  

A post shared by NBC Nightly News (@nbcnightlynews)

In the final moments of his last time anchoring “NBC Nightly News,” 66-year-old Holt told his audience,  “As anchor, it has been an honor to lead this program and an honor to be welcomed into your homes. I'm so grateful for your trust.”

“Around here, facts matter, words matter, journalism matters and you matter,” he continued. “Over the last decade, we have shared some dark and harrowing days and nights from our country — the pandemic, mass shootings, natural disasters — each testing our resilience and our compassion. That's why I often like to leave you with something to smile about, moments that reassure and connect us.”

“I'll miss our evenings together, and I will miss the team that puts it all together, my dear friends and my colleagues. But for now, I just want to say thank you to my incredibly supportive and patient family and all of you,” he concluded. “Please continue to take care of yourself and each other, and I'll do the same.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Chris Lane & Lauren Lane Expecting Baby Number 3","https://entertainmentnow.com/country-music/chris-lauren-lane-expecting-baby-number-3/","Sat, 31 May 2025 01:04:37 GMT","

Chris Lane, country music artist, and Lauren Bushnell Lane, former “Bachelor” contestant, are expanding to a family of five.

Chris, 40, and Lauren, 35, took to their Instagrams on May 29 to share the news. The couple posted a joint reel of the family posing for pictures on the beach as Lauren's belly peeked through a yellow cardigan.

A post shared by Lauren Lane (@laurenlane)

“Party of 5 coming this November! 🤍” the couple captioned the video.

Fans shared their support and excitement in the comments section.

“Oh my gosh! Goosebumps, for sure. God bless you and your beautiful family,” one fan shared.

“Congrats! Another beautiful baby to add to your family ❤️❤️,” another fan commented.

As People reported, Lauren found out she was pregnant before the couple had decided yet if they were going to have a third baby. 

“Needless to say, cycle tracking isn't the most effective thing,” she told People. “But clearly, I'm just gonna go with the belief that it was meant to be, and this little human being is meant to be on this earth. I'm kind of glad that we didn't have to make the decision. It was just decided for us.”

The country singer also shared his excitement for the new addition to the family.

“It's very exciting,” he told People, “I'm exhausted just thinking about having a newborn. I'm too old for this!”

The couple is wishing for a healthy baby and are already parents of two boys, Dutton and Baker. A gender reveal is to come soon and Lauren shared she would be happy welcoming another boy.

“I know how to be a boy mom like the back of my hand at this point,” Lauren told People, “and I feel confident in that role. And I love being a boy mom. But truly a healthy baby has always been the number one wish.”

Chris shared he has “never envisioned” himself being a girl dad before, “so I would be a little nervous if that were the case. I'm excited to find out, though.”

Chris is gearing up to drop his latest album, “Shade Tree”, on June 20. The album is home to 12 tracks and has a special meaning behind it.

A post shared by Chris Lane (@iamchrislane)

“I wrote Shade Tree as a way to look back on how lucky I was to grow up under the shade tree in our yard in Kernersville, NC,” Chris wrote in the caption of the post. “Every day was football, baseball, basketball, hide & seek, family cookouts, chicken stews, and birthdays.”

“Life was hard,” he continued. “Life was beautiful. We didn't have much, but somehow, we had it all at the same time. I'm thankful for the way I was raised, the lessons it taught me, and most importantly, for finding Jesus. Growing up under that shade tree made me the man I am today.”

Television history is filled with plenty of infamous flops that barely made it to air before the networks gave them the chop: 2012 crossdressing series “Work It,” a 2007 musical drama “Viva Laughin” that the New York Times referred to as possibly “the worst show in the history of television,” and the 1990 British sitcom about Hitler “Heil Honey, I'm Home.” 25 years ago, an animated series adaptation of Kevin Smith‘s 1994 cult film “Clerks” joined that dubious club — and seemed cheerfully aware of its fate the entire time. 

In the pilot episode of the ABC adult animated sitcom, which remarkably was not one of the two episodes that were broadcast before the show got canceled and burned off over at Comedy Central, the lead characters Dante and Randal (voiced by Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson) watch an episode of “The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer” — “America's #1 sitcom,” as they put it. A relatively deep cut reference even in the year 2000, most people now would assume the show, about the Black butler of Abraham Lincoln's White House, is just a fake show invented as a gag. But it was very real: it premiered in 1998 on UPN, was the subject of boycotts and protests by the NAACP for its insensitive handling of slavery, and ultimately was canned after four episodes aired.

By invoking such a notorious flop, the “Clerks” animated series was practically daring the same fate upon itself — and in the end, it only lasted half as long as “Desmond Pfeiffer.” But that joke also exemplifies why the show, which premiered with its fourth episode on May 31, 2000, was such a weird, delightfully unpredictable hidden gem, and still the best thing Kevin Smith has ever attached his name to.

 










Developed for television by Smith, his frequent collaborator Scott Mosier, and David Mandel (best known for his work on “Seinfeld”), “Clerks: The Animated Series” took the original film — a black and white, dirtbag hangout comedy made on a minuscule budget — and turned it into a densely wacky animated series, complete with a megalomaniac billionaire named Leonardo Leonardo (Alec Baldwin) that bears more than a bit of a resemblance to Mr. Burns from “The Simpsons.” That makes it easy to dismiss the show as just stupid, an attempted translation of a cult hit that misses the mark on what made it special. But the show, which renders the characters of the film in the appealingly thick-lined style of “Kim Possible” and “Danny Phantom” art director Stephen Silver, was subtly subversive and fresh, with a meta approach to its humor that feels a few years ahead of its time. 

The prime example is the second episode, a parody of a classic TV clip show that came a solid decade before “Community” did a similar bit. In it, Dante and Randal get trapped in a freezer and reminisce about their crazy adventures — which mostly consist of the same clip from the pilot (which, again, hadn't even actually aired because of the way ABC aired the show) repeated several times. The joke escalates from there: they start flashing back to earlier moments from the episode, they get trapped in a loop of flashbacks of the same moment, and eventually the show moves on to flashbacks of scenes we've never seen before.

 










That's the funniest and cleverest episode of the show, but the other five have a lot to like about them as well. A bit meaner and rougher than Smith's other work — which tends to be rather sentimental at heart — “Clerks: The Animated Series” isn't particularly interested in making its characters and their dead-end lives relatable. Instead, the episodes veer into absurd, cheekily bizarre directions, breaking the fourth wall at every opportunity. Episode 3 begins with Randal and Dante opening fan mail and addressing the lack of diversity on the show by introducing the first Black character (who isn't actually allowed to speak or do anything of note). The fourth episode, a parody of a courtroom drama in which Dante gets sued by Jay (Jason Mewes) after the slacker slips at the Quick Mart, leaves the case unresolved when a disclaimer that the episode's ending was lost precedes a parody sequence purporting to be a new ending created by an outsourced Korean animation team. The final episode ends in a tribute to the iconic “Looney Tunes” short “Duck Amuck,” which doesn't work as a way to close out the barebones plot at all, but tips its hat to the inspirations behind the show's anarchic, non-sequitur humor.

Not everything about “Clerks: The Animated Series” holds up to time. It's an extremely 2000 series in every respect: its general burnout vibe, its cultural references to pressing issues like disappointment over “The Phantom Menace,” and its tendency towards edgelordey shock humor and gay jokes — though the finale, at least, directly self-mocks how much the series overplays the bro-ey gay panic. But its faults are easy to forgive when the six episodes are so funny and clever, and make you wish there were more. You get the sense that the people behind the show were content for it to be a short-lived gem though: by the sixth episode, when Dante and Randal attend a panel to speak about making “Clerks” and get accosted by fans of the movie who hate the show, it's pretty clear that the series was around for a good time, not a long time.  

 










Every episode of “Clerks: The Animated Series” can be purchased on Apple TV+.

Donald Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill” is a reverse-Robin Hood nightmare. It steals from the poor to give to the rich. The 1,038-page version that passed the House will also balloon the deficit by nearly $4 trillion.


	The Trump tax bill achieves this feat by extending (and in many cases expanding) tax breaks for the richest Americans, while at the same time depriving more than 10 million Americans of health insurance and regular access to their doctors, by axing $880 billion from Medicaid. It also increases red tape for Obamacare, while allowing other subsidies to lapse, boxing millions more out of their insurance.


	The bill is regressive as a matter of tax policy. It will reduce the take-home incomes of bottom 10 percent of income earners by four percent by the end of the decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects. Penn Wharton, Trump's alma mater, finds that most households earning less than $51,000 will immediately see their after-tax income decrease. Meanwhile, the bill boosts the incomes of the top one percent by nearly $70,000 in the first year alone, giving that elite cohort a collective $124 billion net tax cut.

	











	The Trump bill sorta makes good on Trump's campaign sales gimmicks — offering temporary, three-year tax breaks on tips (cost: $40 billion); the extra income earned from overtime ($124 billion); and auto loan interest ($58 billion); while also offering a tax credit to seniors, meant as an offset of taxes on Social Security income ($72 billion).

	











	But as passed by the House, the tax bill also has many ugly provisions. Some are related to taxes, like the abolition of taxes on gun silencers, or ending tax incentives for clean energy and cars. Others are just completely extraneous, like language prohibiting state- and local regulation of artificial intelligence for 10 years.Below is a survey of seven terrible tricks up the sleeves of the Big Beautiful Bill:


1) Undermining the Rule of Law


	A provision slipped into the House bill, unrelated to taxes, would have a major impact on the courts and the rule of law. It blocks any funding to enforce contempt of court orders. This, in turn, could enable the Trump administration to flout the rulings of judges without consequence. Erwin Chemerinsky, a professor of law as the University of California, is sounding the alarm that this is an affront to the basic functioning of our democracy. He writes in a post at Just Security that “nothing could be done” to enforce injunctions against the executive branch were this provision to become law — “even when the government had been found to violate the Constitution.” In fact, he adds, “the greatest effect of adopting the provision would be to make countless existing judicial orders unenforceable.” These concerns are ripe because the Trump administration's countless illegal executive orders and actions keep getting turned back in court, and the administration's compliance — as with falling to “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia from the gulag in El Salvador, as directed by the Supreme Court — has been irregular at best. 


2) Rewarding Rich Homeowners

	Rich people in blue states have cause to laud the Big Beautiful Bill. It quadruples a tax break that one analysis finds “Overwhelmingly Benefits Wealthy, White Households.” We are talking here about the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction. The tax break has some logic. It is intended to keep folks from having to pay federal taxes on the tax dollars they owe to governments closer to home. The 2017 Trump tax bill limited the deductibility of these payments — once unlimited — to $10,000, to help pay for its sweeping tax cuts for the rich and corporations. That partially preserved a break that's a boon to middle-class homeowners in blue states with high property taxes, including the Northeast or the West Coast, while stripping it from the vacation home and private-school set.

	High earners in states from New Jersey to California have since bridled against the SALT deduction limit, arguing it's a form of double taxation, and have won over political allies in both parties. Inside the House GOP, a group of lawmakers calling themselves the “very salty” five held up the Trump bill until the SALT deduction was boosted to $40,000 and made available to couples earning up to half-a-million dollars a year. 


3) A Boondoggle for Private Schools












	On the charitable giving side of the tax act, the House Bill creates a back-door subsidy for private school vouchers. Rich people who donate to nonprofits that hand out vouchers to private K-12 schools will now receive not a tax deduction — usually capped at 35 cents off taxes for every one dollar donated — but a tax credit. Every dollar donated is counted as a dollar paid in taxes. This tax credit not only applies to the value of cash donations, but the market value of stocks. In many cases — as outlined here — donors would be able to reap a greater return on their investments by donating stock that has appreciated in value, and reaping the tax benefits, than by selling the investment and then owing capital gains taxes. The value of this incentive is estimated at $23 billion over 10 years, with the administration subsidizing the flight from public education at the same time it aims to eliminate the federal Department of Education.


4) Leave No Heir Behind


	No GOP tax bill would be complete without a giveaway to the scions of billionaire families. The Republican Party has long demonized the estate tax as the “death tax,” inveighing against it as a threat to salt-of-the-earth family farmers. Thanks to Trump's first tax bill, the estate tax exemption currently stands at nearly $27 million for couples, but is due to fall to about half that, absent a change in the law. The “Big Beautiful Bill” indexes the current exemption to inflation and makes the tax break permanent. A rich couple will be able to pass on $30 million to their descendants without paying a penny of tax next year. According to a letter from Americans for Tax Fairness, “this handout to lucky heirs and heiresses will cost over $200 billion in lost revenue over 10 years.”


5) Shortchange Kids of Immigrants


	A MAGA tax bill needs some anti-immigrant juice. And the Big Beautiful Bill provides that by limiting availability of the child tax credit to only citizen children with a citizen parent. The child tax credit is currently available to children with Social Security numbers, so long as their parents have a taxpayer identification number, given to immigrants who pay taxes. The BBB would increase the value of the credit to $2,500, but require that the parent or parents claiming the credit also have Social Security numbers, as a proxy for citizenship status. The change is expected to disqualify nearly two million citizen children in mixed-status households from this vital government support. 


6) No Insurance for You!












	One of the most controversial changes in the Big Beautiful Bill is to impose a work requirement on supposedly “able-bodied” adults to maintain eligibility for Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans. The requirement is spelled out as 80 hours a month of work or volunteering. The implementation is left up to states, some of which are committed to expanding health coverage, but others which have long been ideologically opposed. Enrollees must often navigate a maze of forms and bureaucratic hurdles to establish and maintain eligibility — even before this new work requirement — because Medicaid contains strict income caps. Recipients must prove they are, in fact, poor. The Big Beautiful Bill however adds insult to injury. People who are kicked off Medicaid by failing to navigate the requirements around work and work-reporting, will be punished by becoming ineligible for subsidies for individual insurance plans sold under Obamacare. By design, the Trumpy Medicaid changes will eliminate coverage for 10.3 million people, according to the CBO.

7) Work for Your Supper


	Work requirements are fetishized throughout the Big Beautiful Bill, and also apply to recipients of SNAP, the acronym for the federal food assistance program. As passed, the House bill would expand work requirements in SNAP on adults up to the age of 65. (Current work requirements phase out at 55). It would also require parents with children as young as eight to work outside the house, turning another generation of young poor children into latchkey kids. According to modeling by the Urban league, the Big Beautiful Bill — which so richly rewards billionaires and their heirs — would be financed in part by taking food out of the mouths of hungry families. As many as 2.7 million households would lose food benefits, with the average blow to the family grocery budget totaling $254 a month.

	The tech-bro rich, they are not like you and me. They treat the world like it's their frat house. They view atrocities not as losses of human life but as “atrocitopportunities.” They get high on the fumes of their own disruption. They buy private planes, private security armies, private compounds in the Snowy Hills of Utah, and Argentina — as in, the entire country of Argentina — on a whim. They think nothing of killing one of their own, should a formerly-down-for-anything bro not view the complete and utter breakdown of modern society as a chance to remake Earth 2.0 in their own exfoliated, highly toned image. They refuse to fiddle while Rome burns, but hey, they know a ton of venture capitalists who'd fund an app that'd allow you to soundtrack 21st century Ragnarok via the dubstep deep cuts of your choice.


	Imagine a feature-length episode of Succession that treated the final season's villain, GoJo CEO Lukas Matsson, as its main character and then multiplied him by four, and you'd have something like Mountainhead, Jesse Armstrong‘s caustic, corrosive satire of Silicon Valley mega-royalty run amuck. (It's on Max now and premieres on HBO proper tonight.) The British showrunner of that blisteringly cynical drama spent five years and 39 episodes giving us a portrait of filthy rich people pulling strings and behaving badly. You think the elite of the elite are broken, petty, and sociopathic, the show continually and rhetorically asked. You have no idea. He now focuses all that bile and ire on the Musks, the Thiels, the Bezoses and the Zuckerbergs who feel they're contemporary Caesars, and wonders aloud: What's to stop them from taking everything over?

	











	But first, there will be dick-measuring contests. Or rather, net-worth-in-billions-measuring contests, which is the One-percenter contingent's version of slapping phalluses next to rulers on tabletops. Among the Brewsters, i.e. the quartet of CEO alphas that have gathered together for what's supposed to be a super-chill poker weekend, the current champ would be Venis (Cory Michael Smith), whose Facebook-like platform Traam has just launched some major additions to their in-house content-creation suite. In second place is Jeff (Ramy Youssef), an AI guru getting a lot of love from the public sector about an anti-deepfake filter his company has concocted. The bronze medal goes to Randall (Steve Carell), the group's elder statesman and self-admitted oracle of Hegelian wisdom. Rounding out the group is Hugo (Jason Schwartzman), also known as Superman. Or rather, that's “Soup-erman,” derived from his original nickname “Soup Kitchen”; this runt of the litter still spells billionaire with a capital M.

	Hugo is hosting his longtime buds at his new place outside of Park City — serious props to the production design team for making this real-life getaway somehow seem even uglier and more bunker-like — in the hopes of changing his pole position. He's got a meditation app that will transform the mental health space, especially since that sector is blowing up due to global instability. Who better to hit up for funding then his Brewski besties? 


	He's not the only one with an agenda, however. That content-creation app on Traam is stoking serious sectarian violence everywhere from Kansas to Kazakhstan, and Venis needs Jeff to sell him his AI to soothe his board. Jeff, having apparently downloaded something resembling a conscience, wants nothing to to do with his old pal's “4Chan on fucking acid” shitshow. He's still pissed about some podcast comments Venis made and is happy to see him twist in the wind; plus the catastrophes are doing wonders for his stock. And Randall? He's dying of cancer, and angry that these so-called doctors he's hired to cure him say they can't. But if he can get Venis to fast-track his vision of downloading consciousness online, immortality is just one upgrade away. 


	The more these guys trash-talk each other, suck up to each other, hug it out, slug it out, undermine and over-inflate their respective achievements, the more that Mountainhead sketches a picture of these Master of the Universe in a manner that occasionally draws blood. There are enough quotable lines of dialogue in the movie's first half to remind you why Succession was, pound for pound, one of the most profanely funny shows on TV during its run. Once the decision to attack one of their own dominates the second half, you can feel the zingers lose their sting and the story starting to sag. But as with Armstrong's five-season History of the Decline and Fall of the Roy-man Empire, there's a real attention paid all the way through regarding the way that the powerful speak. And more importantly, how they use language to mask, justify, salve and dismiss their self-serving rottenness. Words matter, but only when they help these men underwrite, say, releasing tools that allow for the ability to distinguish fact from fiction. Or to let them sleep at night while whole populations kill each other. Or to allow them to murder someone yet retain the moral high ground, because, y'know, Nietzche.

	“Do you believe in other people?” Venis asks, in a rare moment of sincerity, to Randall. “I think one has to?” his mentor replies, and given the way that Carell spins the sentence tells you how performative such notions as faith in humanity is for these guys. (All four of the stars eat heartily here, though we might give the edge to Smith, who gives Venis the same level of smarmy, superiority-complex-driven douchebaggery that he gave Chevy Chase in Saturday Night.) Which is why the band of bros' decision that they should literally take over the world feels like a logical next step. Who or what is stop them? 

	











	No, really, we're asking, and so is Armstrong: How could we keep these delusional ratfuckers from what they believe is their destiny of total dominion over humanity? They already control the hardware, the software, the artificial intelligence that has supplanted actual intelligence, the ability to separate fact from self-destructive LOLZ fiction. The only thing in their way is their own ADHD and dysfunctional group dynamic. Mountainhead takes its name from Hugo's snowy retreat, which eventually doubles as a sort of Eagle's Nest for their would-be New World Order; the moniker's resemblance to The Fountainhead, designed by “Ayn Bland,” is duly noted. But we'd suggest an alternative title for what often feels like a documentary of our apocalypse, now: 4 Tech Bros, 1 Coup. This what happens when “move fast and break shit” becomes the ruling class's gospel. What you end up with is a world broken faster than a speeding click.

	Ruby Ibarra, a Filipina-American rapper from the Bay Area known for her potent storytelling, made her debut on NPR's Tiny Desk this week.


	Chosen among 7,500 entries from independent artists across the country, Ibarra secured the top spot for the series' annual contest with her entry track, “Bakunawa,” which released last fall. With her hair slicked back into a ponytail and wearing an “I Love Pinays” tee for the moment, Ibarra performed alongside her all-Filipino band and together, they delivered a heavy-hitting trio of tracks buoyed by shimmering instrumentals.


	It was a moment Ibarra seized. “Being human is not illegal. Immigrants have been here, lived here, worked here,” she said before introducing herself: “And this immigrant is here. From Tacloban City, Philippines, all the way to Washington, D.C., my name is Ruby Ibarra.”


	When speaking to Rolling Stone over the phone, Ibarra, who was born on the Leyte island, recalls her early influences. “A lot of the early memories that I have kept from spending the first few years in the Philippines involved a lot of music,” says the artist. “At a young age, a lot of my cousins, uncles were all part of bands, and they perform at local festivals. So, music was always in and outside of my household.” 

	











	After moving to San Lorenzo in San Francisco's East Bay, Ibarra says she was later influenced by hip-hop's Golden Age, from the likes of Tupac, the Fugees, and Wu-Tang Clan. Throughout her music, Ibarra weaves in elements of storytelling embracing the rhythms and narratives of the genre, while also bringing her relentless blend of Tagalog and English to her lyrics.

	When discussing her choice of tracks for her NPR appearance, along with “Bakunawa,” Ibarra also featured “Someday” (what she says is a “reminder” to herself that some of the best things in life happen in due time) and “7000 Miles,” a song she says felt important to include “because of the state that we're in right now in this country.”


	“There's a lot of questions about who belongs here, and for me, I've always been such a strong advocate, as an immigrant myself, of making sure that people feel seen, people feel visible, people feel like they're welcome,” she says. “It was a perfect opportunity to create conversation around that and at the same time, to also celebrate my experiences as a Filipina immigrant.”

	The single, from her 2017 album Circa 91, portrays her mother's journey from the U.S. to the Philippines and Ibarra's own evolving frame of mind while watching her mother struggle and fight for a better life for their family. The rapper says that during her Tiny Desk performance, her mother was in the audience. “Where the chorus goes, ‘Mama will make it in America,' it was so special,” says Ibarra. While the camera didn't capture the crowd that included a small group of family and friends, Ibarra says that when she would look over, “they were crying, they were passing around a box of tissue, and I was starting to get soaked up myself just seeing my mom's reaction, and it was just special.”


	She says the moment was an important experience for her and her band, as well as a “collective win.” The ensemble included June Millington of Fanny, Ouida, and Charito Soriano on vocals; Jojo Ramirez on drums; Camille Ramirez on flute and bass; Angelo “Lasi” Macaraeg on acoustic guitar and keyboard; and Anna Macan on electric guitar.


	She adds, “We do hope to see more Filipino American artists on that stage, in that space, there's so much great talent out there, and we're hoping that we can keep that door open.”

	When looking ahead, Ibarra has her efforts focused on her sophomore album that will be released through her Bolo Music Group, which she founded with producer Lasi in 2023.


	“I want to make sure that the music that I share always has as a message, has a point. I'm not the type of rapper to ever waste even just the word. Every word is in the song for a reason,” she says. Ibarra says that her music, like her, will continued to evolve, and that the experience of motherhood has made her “revisit a lot of the lyrics that I have.” Passing on the stories of those before her, Ibarra says “I want to continue becoming a songwriter so that the songs I release can help create dialog with my daughter someday.”

	It's Elon Musk's last day as an official employee of the federal government, “but not really, because he will, always, be with us, helping all the way” — at least according to President Donald Trump's announcement of his parting press conference with the billionaire. 


	In an Oval Office presser that mirrored many of the duo's televised White House appearances, the president thanked Musk for his time leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and for “willingly” accepting “outrageous abuse and slander and lies and attacks, because he does love our country.” 


	Trump reiterated that “Elon is really not leaving” and that he is “going to be back-and-forth” to tend to his “baby,” DOGE, and that “he's going to be doing a lot of things.”


	Trump presented Musk with a ceremonial White House key for his efforts, and added that under DOGE's guidance “the mind-set of the senior ranks at every federal department has really changed.” 

	











	Musk stated that, in his view, the work of DOGE was just beginning, and that despite his  departure he expected “to continue to provide advice on whatever the president would like advice on.” 


	“I will continue to be visiting here and be a friend and advisor to the president, and we look forward to being back in this amazing room,” Musk said at one point. 


	The press conference came hours after The New York Times released a report detailing Musk's allegedly regular use of ketamine and other recreational drugs while campaigning on behalf of Trump in 2024. According to sources who spoke to the Times, Musk had privately complained that his regular consumption of ketamine was causing him issues with his bladder, a common side effect of chronic use. Musk also reportedly took ecstasy and mushrooms while stumping for Trump last year.

	











	When Fox News' Peter Doocy attempted to ask about the report, Musk interrupted him before he could finish the question.

	“New York Times, is that the same publication that got a Pulitzer Prize for false reporting on Russiagate? Is that the same organization? I think it is?” Musk asked in a bizarre, seemingly rehearsed bit. “Let's move on,” he said to Doocey, who — in typical Fox News fashion — heeded the instruction and abandoned the line of questioning.


	The bizarre nature of the press conference was highlighted by Musk having a black eye, which he claimed was due to his five-year-old son punching him in the face. “I was just walking around with little X, and I said, ‘Go ahead, punch me in the face,' and he did,” Musk said.


	The gone-but-not-forgotten sentiment around Musk's departure was reaffirmed by the White House and other prominent GOP lawmakers. 


	White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday that members of the president's Cabinet will continue “to work with the respective DOGE employees who have onboarded as political appointees at all of these agencies,” and that “the mission of DOGE will continue, and many DOGE employees are now political appointees of our government.” 


	In a post on X, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) wrote that although Musk is stepping away from his government role, “the House is eager and ready to act on DOGE's findings so we can deliver even more cuts to big government that President Trump wants and the American people demand.”

	DOGE's chaotic cuts have been cruel, nonsensical, and widely informed by misinformation about waste and fraud. The agency gutted government services that benefit the less fortunate, including all but eliminating the United States Agency for International Development. Some have estimated that the cuts have already resulted in 300,000 deaths, with over two-thirds of those being children.


	Trump continued to lavish praise on Musk's work during the press conference on Friday. “Elon's service to America has been without comparison in modern history,” he said.

	It's official: After a six-year saga, Taylor Swift finally owns her music. She took control following a tense situation that started in 2019, when her contract with Big Machine ended and her masters were sold to Scooter Braun and Ithaca Holdings. Today, after re-recording four out of six of the albums she had released under Big Machine, Swift announced in a letter that she now had control over all her old music — and her fans are just as elated as she is.


	Zainub Amir, who manages the update account @SwiftNYC, is still “speechless,” she says. “I am still trying to find the words. Taylor has poured so much into her music and seeing her finally own it all felt incredibly emotional. It's such a testament to her persistence and a huge inspiration to anyone who's ever felt unheard or undervalued.”


	Longtime fan Kyra Beck initially thought the letter was fake as it began circulating on social media. “I try to approach everything on the Internet with a healthy dose of skepticism,” she admits. “Once I realized it wasn't, I ran to her website to read the letter. I've been a fan since around the Red era, so I've lived through the entire masters situation, and her honesty throughout this journey has been so inspiring to see. I just feel so overwhelmed with happiness and pride for her.”

	“These albums have such a special place in all our hearts,” says another fan named Rachel Rogerson. “To have them back in the hands of the person who created them means the absolute world. If I'm honest, I couldn't stop crying at the thought of her owning these albums, as I watched and supported her through all the turmoil and pain that this caused.”

	











	The point of Swift's re-recording project, in her own words, was to devalue the original albums while they were under other people's ownership. For much of the fandom, this became a kind of political stance: Numerous fans avoided listening to the original recordings, in a show of solidarity with Swift. Today, many celebrated online by listening to the original versions of classic Swift songs like “Style” and “Holy Ground.”

	“Personally, I did not listen to the ‘stolen' versions after Taylor's Versions were released,” Rogerson says. “Knowing the money received would be going to a person who has taken advantage of someone that I deeply love was a dealbreaker for me, and it brings me immense joy that [Scooter Braun] will no longer be benefiting from both the sales and streams of these albums.”


	After Swift's Eras Tour wrapped in 2024, the star went dark after the Grammys and Super Bowl. Swifties waited impatiently for her next move, assuming that re-recorded versions of Reputation and her self-titled debut album (known as “debut” colloquially in the fandom) would be released soon. In the letter, Swift admitted she barely made a dent in re-recording Reputation, finding it difficult to recreate the magic of that album again. For some fans, it's a little sad to see the end of the re-recording project, especially given the numerous, never-before-released “vault” recordings she'd tack on to each Taylor's Version.


	“It's so bittersweet,” says fan Savannah Charles. “Reputation is definitely a fan favorite that so many Swifties were eagerly anticipating, but at the same time, I think Taylor hit the nail on the head — it's a fan favorite because she perfected that era.”


	Overall, the fandom feels uniquely bonded by the experience. Like Swift's music, the ordeal made her stans feel like they were on this journey with her, fighting for her music as much as she was. For many, the experience was the reason why Eras Tour existed in the first place, so there were some positives they've observed as they reflect on the situation now that it's over.

	“As awful as the original situation was, I do think it was the catalyst for so many incredible things, like the Eras Tour,” Beck says. “I got to interact with tons of other Swifties while creating my Eras Tour surprise song blanket, and it was incredible to see how united everyone was in their support for Taylor's fight to own her work. I've even heard of newer fans saying they were waiting for the re-recordings to listen to Reputation and her debut for the first time, so I hope they're having fun listening today!”

I love when Taylor Swift pretends like she's unsure if we want her to release music she's recorded when she knows her fans are feral and would literally make an album of her farts chart.

It was all worth it for this https://t.co/KNsJpPDtzJ

the concept of her using the money from the eras tour to buy her old masters is the most poetic shit i've ever seen tayjesus. pic.twitter.com/L75mep7HW7

not religious or anything but I think this is how religious people felt when Jesus returned

I know you're new here if you're like “omg I don't know how I can go back to the originals” because I feel like I just won a custody battle

the eras tour would be the perfect place to celebrate this

the taylor's versions AND the originals are both so beloved to me, idc idc my heart is big enough for all of taylor's music

It's so bizarre that this info didn't get leaked, Taygod is so powerful

A startling video has captured a clear view of what a witness believes was a giant UFO flying over California.

The video, recorded on April 27 by an anonymous resident in Twentynine Palms, follows a brightly lit hexagonal-shaped object as it flies over the desert.

The UFO reportedly appeared out of nowhere at around 22:27 p.m. local time, while the witness was standing in an isolated cabin.

According to the report the witness submitted to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) two days later, the suspected spacecraft was moving very slowly and erratically, as if it was in a state of confusion.

""It appeared to move arbitrarily, without any clear direction. The movements were erratic and at varying speeds,"" the witness wrote in the report to NUFORC - GazetaExpress reports.

The large object also appeared to pulse, emitting bright light from its edges, as it moved across the sky for about 15 minutes.

“Tonight is the new moon – so it was probably not the moon, and yet it was much brighter than a full moon,” the witness continued.

""What stood out was its extraordinary lighting and strange shape and irregular movements,"" he added.

As the witness in Twentynine Palms followed the UFO, he added that the strange object began to change shape – going from a hexagonal object to a circular shape.

The person who recorded the video on his phone was the only witness in the cabin that night, so no one else was able to confirm the event.

However, he stated in his report to NUFORC that he had not taken any type of perception-affecting substance during the observation and that he had had clear vision throughout.

NUFORC officials attempted to find an explanation for the event, noting that a SpaceX rocket launch had taken place that day, but the Falcon 9 rocket had been launched from Florida three hours earlier.

A previous rocket launch had created a similar phenomenon over Great Britain in March.

That strange shape, according to experts, was caused by the glowing frozen fuel being released from the SpaceX rocket.

The blue spiral is formed when excess fuel released from the rapidly spinning rocket rises, reflecting sunlight into the upper atmosphere – giving it an otherworldly glow – before turning into water vapor.

This new sighting occurred just days before a hearing in the US Congress on UFOs and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).

Speakers, including Pentagon UFO project whistleblower Luis Elizondo, a former NASA administrator and a retired Navy admiral, called on the government to publish what it knows about these unexplained sightings.

They also called for increased funding for the detection of UFOs and UAPs, which, according to some of the speakers, were being suppressed by the American intelligence community.

Elizondo and others pointed out that witnesses like the one in Twentynine Palms have no official central channel in the U.S. to report UFO sightings.

For this reason, many potential reports remain unreported or are never investigated by the military or federal authorities.

NUFORC and the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) are two of the most well-known civilian organizations that keep records of citizen sightings.

Although these two organizations are not affiliated with the government, they often share data with researchers or state institutions when important cases occur. /Express newspaper/

A scientist has issued an ominous message to humanity after a UFO covered in unexplained and weird writing was discovered - potentially changing the future of our knowledge of aliens.

Dr Julia Mossbridge, a cognitive neuroscientist and a researcher of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPS), which is a new term for UFO sightings, says we may as a human race soon have to deal with the fact that aliens may well exist and move into a new era of our understanding.

It comes as more and more information is being released about alleged contact with UFOs and extraterrestrials. Specifically, the discovery of an unusual, sphere-shaped object found in Columbia that scientists believe could be a piece of UFO technology.

The object displays symbols akin to ancient scripts like runes and scientists have used AI to try to help decipher the strange text, with Dr Mossbridge telling Fox News: ""We are entering a time when we are starting to recognize as humans we don't have the control that we thought we had over everything.""

She believes the potential disclosure of alien life could throw many people and the world into chaos as they try to cope with the knowledge of their existence.

""One of the mistakes we make is [saying] because I think I understand this, everything I think today is true,"" she said, adding that it makes people confused when something shows up that doesn't ""fit our model of the world.""

Mossbridge herself remains sceptical that this discovery is a genuine UFO but much of the public remains convinced. ""The sphere itself seems kind of like an art project,"" she added.

""If an artist is doing this, why is that? Well, I think it's partly the same reason. It's because we're learning that we don't understand what's in our skies or our waters. And there's something going on that's essentially bigger than us.""

On the other hand, Dr Jose Luis Velazquez, a radiologist who examined the sphere said he found no clues that would typically be found on the sphere had humans made it.

""It is of artificial origin, in that it shows no evidence of welding, and its internal structure is composed of high-density elements. More testing is needed to establish its origin,"" he said.

Mail Online reports that his team of researchers used AI to assist in deciphering the design and found it to read: ""The origin of birth through union and energy in the cycle of transformation, meeting point of unity, expansion, and consciousness — individual consciousness.""

They said: ""We interpret it as a message to humanity, encouraging a collective shift in consciousness to help Mother Earth—especially considering the current issues with pollution and environmental decline.""

In similar circumstances, a set of three-fingered alien mummies have been baffling scientists since they were discovered in 2017 in the Nazca desert and now scientists say they are 1,200 years old.

Also at times dismissed as merely an art project, the ‘alien' mummies of Peru may have actually been murdered, experts believe. Scientists examining the mysterious three-fingered bodies with elongated skulls have made new findings they claim prove the specimens are ‘100% real'.

Some of the injuries they suffered suggest they experienced violent deaths - and may have been bumped off. Discovered in 2017 in Peru's Nazca desert the mummies were presented to the world in Mexico two years ago as possible fossilised remains of extraterrestrials who were not part of Earth's evolutionary chain.

Initial DNA analysis showed they were part-human and part 'unknown species', prompting Mexico's first congressional hearing on UFOs.

A startling video has captured a clear view of what a witness believes was a giant UFO flying over California.

The video, recorded on April 27 by an anonymous resident in Twentynine Palms, follows a brightly lit hexagonal-shaped object as it flies over the desert.

The UFO reportedly appeared out of nowhere at around 22:27 p.m. local time, while the witness was standing in an isolated cabin.

According to the report the witness submitted to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) two days later, the suspected spacecraft was moving very slowly and erratically, as if it was in a state of confusion.

""It appeared to move arbitrarily, without any clear direction. The movements were erratic and at varying speeds,"" the witness wrote in the report to NUFORC - GazetaExpress reports.

The large object also appeared to pulse, emitting bright light from its edges, as it moved across the sky for about 15 minutes.

“Tonight is the new moon – so it was probably not the moon, and yet it was much brighter than a full moon,” the witness continued.

""What stood out was its extraordinary lighting and strange shape and irregular movements,"" he added.

As the witness in Twentynine Palms followed the UFO, he added that the strange object began to change shape – going from a hexagonal object to a circular shape.

The person who recorded the video on his phone was the only witness in the cabin that night, so no one else was able to confirm the event.

However, he stated in his report to NUFORC that he had not taken any type of perception-affecting substance during the observation and that he had had clear vision throughout.

NUFORC officials attempted to find an explanation for the event, noting that a SpaceX rocket launch had taken place that day, but the Falcon 9 rocket had been launched from Florida three hours earlier.

A previous rocket launch had created a similar phenomenon over Great Britain in March.

That strange shape, according to experts, was caused by the glowing frozen fuel being released from the SpaceX rocket.

The blue spiral is formed when excess fuel released from the rapidly spinning rocket rises, reflecting sunlight into the upper atmosphere – giving it an otherworldly glow – before turning into water vapor.

This new sighting occurred just days before a hearing in the US Congress on UFOs and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).

Speakers, including Pentagon UFO project whistleblower Luis Elizondo, a former NASA administrator and a retired Navy admiral, called on the government to publish what it knows about these unexplained sightings.

They also called for increased funding for the detection of UFOs and UAPs, which, according to some of the speakers, were being suppressed by the American intelligence community.

Elizondo and others pointed out that witnesses like the one in Twentynine Palms have no official central channel in the U.S. to report UFO sightings.

For this reason, many potential reports remain unreported or are never investigated by the military or federal authorities.

NUFORC and the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) are two of the most well-known civilian organizations that keep records of citizen sightings.

Although these two organizations are not affiliated with the government, they often share data with researchers or state institutions when important cases occur. /Express newspaper/

The Annabelle doll's tour across the country sparked theories that the famously haunted relic was responsible for chaotic events that followed, but Annabelle's keepers have rebuked the fiery claims in exclusive interviews with DailyMail.com. 

Annabelle, a famously haunted Raggedy Anne doll, started a tour earlier this month ahead of a Psychic Festival, making stops in West Virginia, Louisiana, and Texas. 

The doll's famous history began in 1970 after it had been gifted to a Hartford nurse and then began moving on her own and, in one instance, allegedly attacked the owner's fiancé. 

Lorraine and Ed Warren, renowned paranormal researchers and founders of Warren's Occult Museum, investigated the doll's paranormal activity and gave her a permanent spot in their museum. 

She was displayed in a protective case, fitted with carved prayers and crosses as well as a sign made by Ed Warren, which read, 'Warning: Positively Do Not Open.' 

The Warrens had always warned about moving Annabelle but for those who took the doll on tour they vehemently defended doing so and say it is what the Warrens would have wanted.

NESPR Lead Investigator into the paranormal, Chris Gilloren, who was part of the tour team, told DailyMail.com: '[Annabelle's] not a spectacle, but it's a great way to get people talking about evil. That's what Ed and Lorraine wanted to do. They wanted to expose the devil, and tell people, advise people that the devil is real.'

Ryan Buell, a paranormal investigator who also joined the tour, agreed that it was about education and continuing to spread the work of Ed and Lorraine Warren. 

Annabelle just completed her tour across the US with the New England Society for Psychic Research, making stops in West Virginia, Louisiana and Texas, but what followed her were a series of unfortunate events that the public linked to the haunted doll

On May 15, as Annabelle left Louisiana - her second tour stop - the historic 166-year-old Nottoway Plantation was destroyed in a blazing fire

'We keep the legacy and name of Ed and Lorraine alive. That they devoted their lives to this work, that there are people our there who still dedicate their own lives to helping people who are having these experiences,' Buell said. 

'It's not that people just went in and saw a doll and they're like, 'oh cool.' We sat there and we talked to people. We talked about the dangers. We talk about the precautions.' 

But the tour was not without it's strange and creepy moments that fueled wild online speculation on Annabelle's ability to leave a path of destruction as she moved around the country.         

On May 15, as Annabelle left Louisiana - her second tour stop - the historic 166-year-old Nottoway Plantation was destroyed in a blazing fire. 

Online speculation quickly turned to the doll's close presence as the reason the historic site went up in flames, but her caretakers are not convinced. 

Gilloren said: 'I don't know where these people come up with these... I mean, it's taken off, it's got a mind of its own. 

'We don't think it has anything to do with us, of course, or Annabelle.' 

One post on X connected the dots on May 19 and wrote: 'Three days ago they moved Annabelle, one of the most haunted dolls from Monroe, Connecticut, to New Orleans, Louisiana, and now the largest sugarcane plantation in Louisiana burned down AND 11 inmates in a New Orleans Prison escape...'

'I don't know where these people come up with these... I mean, it's taken off, it's got a mind of its own. We don't think it has anything to do with us, of course, or Annabelle,' Gilloren said

'Didn't the Warren's say she should never be move,' the post concluded.  

Another comment said: 'Taking her down here where there's voodoo and spirits everywhere is actually an idiot move I have to say.' 

Many other social media users worried about their own cities, and even contacted those monitoring Annabelle. 

'...the amount of messages, emails that I received through our websites and social medias... they truly believe Annabelle did all this, which makes no sense to me personally... you know, why would she burn it down?' Gilloren said. 

Gilloren said he believed that the events were purely coincidental. 

Speaking to Buell, DailyMail.com pointed out the route Annabelle took as she left Louisiana. He examined the route through the state and said: 'This is the first time I've ever looked. Okay, yes, I can confirm we were within five miles [of the plantation] on the freeway. And, yes, it was on the same day.

'So, I mean, yes, that is a very bizarre coincidence.' 

Yet, Buell said there was an even stranger occurrence before they left New Orleans - a voodoo Priestess who 'challenged' Annabelle. 

Just days after Annabelle left New Orleans, a group of 'violent' inmates escaped the New Orleans Parish Jail which the public also linked to the haunted doll's nearby presence 

'We were packing up and all of a sudden we heard tambourines and someone's screaming, 'Go to hell, Annabelle.' She laid holy water down and said, 'In the name of New Orleans voodoo, I rebuke you.'... but I mean, there was the thought of, yikes, this priestess just challenged Annabelle,' Buell said

'We were like, 'wait, so we're being blamed for what? A plantation? Somewhere in Louisiana? Louisiana, okay, well probably coincidence,' But I mean, I kind of thought, well, there was this voodoo priestess who challenged Annabelle when we were leaving,' he recalled. 

'We were packing up and all of a sudden we heard tambourines and someone's screaming, 'Go to hell, Annabelle,'' Buell said. 

'She laid holy water down and said, 'In the name of New Orleans voodoo, I rebuke you.'... but I mean, there was the thought of, yikes, this priestess just challenged Annabelle. It was almost like voodoo versus the demonic,' he continued. 

'And so... there was that creeping thought of, 'what if,'' Buell said. 

Theories that blamed Annabelle for the fire and escaped inmates were just the tip of the iceberg of the strange goings on during the doll's time on the road. 

'To our knowledge, it's the first time we brought Annabelle to another haunted location, especially that far out,' Buell said, of their first tour stop in West Virginia State Penitentiary, a famously haunted building. 

'What was weird - and I've been to the penitentiary many, many times - when Annabelle was in the prison, the activity around the prison was low.' 

Buell added that they had psychic mediums with them in the prison who said that other 'spirits' were 'staying at a distance'. 

Buell recalled how things got 'aggressive' as they used a spirit box to communicate with Annabelle on tour, and said: 'People would ask questions, 'who's here with us? Is the entity around Annabelle here?'...suddenly it started to turn to like, 'You b***. I want your body''

Buell said that he had visited the West Virginia State Penitentiary numerous times before, but that Annabelle's presence had quietened other spirit activity he had experienced before. Pictured: Ryan Buell in front of the WV State Penitentiary

While on tour, the team included psychic mediums as well as priests, including Father Bob Bailey who helped bless the team and their equipment for protection against Annabelle's spirit

'[The spirits are] just kind of watching. A couple were saying they felt uneasy,' Buell said. 

'They didn't know what that meant. Then when we took Annabelle out, you know, we're wrapped up... Then the activity picked up. 

'And the two employees who were there, who regularly witnessed the activity, they pulled me to the side and said, 'look, they don't like it that Annabelle is here. They don't like its energy, so they're hanging back.'' 

After Annabelle had left, other activity picked up again. Buell recalled his previous experiences at the prison, without Annabelle. 

'You'll hear whispers. You'll hear footsteps. And then especially in the infirmary on the second floor. That place is so active,' he said. 'You'll literally hear bangings if you say, hey, knock for me. You'll hear intelligent responses, you know, knocking back.' 

He described his experience within the infirmary as feeling like 'prey'.

'You're very well aware of the fact that you're being watched. You feel like something is literally following you and you start to feel a sense of danger,' he added, recalling that he heard bangs and the slamming of doors around him. 

Annabelle's presence at the penitentiary was not only felt by the spirits within the building, but also those who came in for the tour. 

'I started getting really intrusive thoughts, and Wade had to remind me that the demonic often use psychological tactics, so we just doused ourselves in holy water and kept going,' Buell said of their first day with Annabelle. Pictured: Ryan Buell with the cinematic version of the Annabelle doll

Buell recalled how things got 'aggressive' as they used a spirit box to communicate with the doll, who inspired The Conjuring and Annabelle movie franchises.

He said the process involves one person listening with noise cancelling headphones, only able to hear what's going on inside the box, while those outside ask questions. 

'It's pulling from like public radio stations, right? The spirit box. It just randomly jumps from station to station and pulls sounds and voices from it,' Buell said. 

'People would ask questions, 'who's here with us? Is the entity around Annabelle here?' and suddenly the answers.. suddenly it started to turn to like, 'You b***. I want your body.' Some other stuff.' 

'...I remember at one point I was like okay, I'm done. This energy is getting a little too weird. And so we had another person do it and then they got very emotional,' he continued. 

Despite having worked with Annabelle many times before, Buell still found himself sensing a strange energy surrounding the doll. 

'In New Orleans, myself and Wade, who is a member of NESPR, were mainly the ones giving the talks about the Warren's... and so we would have to stand in front of Annabelle for hours,' he said. 

'And the first day, Wade and I looked at each other and we're like, the energy is so off, like it feels so weird and he totally agreed.'

'We keep the legacy and name of Ed and Lorraine alive. That they devoted their lives to this work, that there are people our there who still dedicate their own lives to helping people who are having these experiences,' Buell said

Gilleron added: '[Annabelle's] not a spectacle, but it's a great way to get people talking about evil. That's what Ed and Lorraine wanted to do. They wanted to expose the devil, and tell people, advise people that the devil is real'

'I started getting really intrusive thoughts, and Wade had to remind me that the demonic often use psychological tactics, so we just doused ourselves in holy water and kept going,' Buell recalled. 

But even with Annabelle's unnerving presence, her keepers defended the doll against the spiral of rumors that Annabelle had caused the chaos along their route. 

'I mean, she was down in San Antonio and I really haven't heard of anything happening in San Antonio. She was in West Virginia. I haven't heard anything up in West Virginia happening,' Gilloren said. 

'She's in Connecticut. I mean she's been in Connecticut for 50 years. We don't blame every kind of disaster on Annabelle,' he added. 

Anabelle's tour continues in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania from July 11-13 and then in Rock Island, Illinois, from October 4-5.

“Aria” by Michael Ballard (independently published). 39 pp. $12.95 paperback.

Okay, poet Michael Ballard hooked this reader at his back-cover, self-generated blurbs: They're blurbs as if written by Walt Whitman (… “do not stand idly by for word of mouth, do not accept the tepid reviews of stodgy critics”), by Emily Dickinson (… “am happy to report I did experience a pleasant chill”), and by Billy Collins (“good luck, all the same”). This collection is serious enough but refreshingly witty.

Ballard, who wrote “on and off most of his adult life,” only turned to poetry at age 66. That being a mortality-aware time of life, many of these poems deal with death. Fortunately, Ballard's death-awareness often highlights the pleasures of living.

Themes are universal. Topics are everyday — grocery shopping, dental appointments — but Ballard punches the unusual into them — “geezer Wednesdays” eliminate the shopper's need to make choices; the dentist's “hm” sets off speculation on why that ubiquitous sound hasn't made its way into the dictionary.

The poems' real pleasure often comes with Ballard's final line, as in this reflection on the glory of the night sky: “…the cosmos will never/ be able to treasure its own terrifying/ beauty. Only we, we futile ticks on/ the hide of eternity, have the power/ to give the indifferent incandescence its due. /

“It should thank its lucky stars.”

See what I mean?

“I, Ghost: A Paranormal Autobiography” by R.L. Clayton (R. Clayton International Enterprise, Inc.). 341 pp. $16.99 paperback; $4.99 e-book.

R. L. Clayton addresses his audience directly in the opening of this book. He, as everyone else, he writes, wonders about life after death. Good behavior = Paradise; bad behavior = Hell. Trained as an engineer, he decided to apply logic to answering life-after-death questions, and he writes that he thinks he nailed it.

This reader agrees.





“I, Ghost” opens with the first-person character in the middle of a series of tortures. He has been regularly waterboarded, frozen and thawed, and drugged until his memory and name have been eradicated. Now he's being electro-shocked. His torturer steps out, and his son — against explicit orders — picks up the controls, ratchets up the power, and kills our character. As he dies, he sees below him the two torturers — father Leon and 17-year-old Jon — and is overcome with a desire for revenge. He can't let it go.

He then finds himself in an afterlife full of souls like his — dead but tied somehow to the world of the living. A single notion seems to keep them linked. They, like he, had had a choice to continue their passage, but elected to remain close to their sources. There is no joy in this dimension.

The story is that our character has been part of a biomedical experiment in which criminals can avoid execution by participating in vaccine development. Our character discovers he can invade the minds and dreams of living souls, which comes in handy when an insidious international threat arises. Interestingly, the plot in this novel — different from Clayton's normal action novels — seems secondary to “I, Ghost” as a meditation on the psychology of torture, the nature of the afterlife and the soul, an exploration of good and evil, and the possibility of redemption. It's a worthy read.

“Urban Trails Tucson” by Sirena Rana (Mountaineers Books). 288 pp. $18.95.

This handsome pack-sized guidebook is a must-have for hiking in the Tucson area. It includes 65 color photos, 43 maps, plant and animal guides, cultural background, geographic notes, trail descriptions and key trail details such as distance, elevation gain, difficulty, fitness suitability, family- and dog-friendliness, amenities, etc.

Author Sirena Rana, founder of Trails Inspire, proves an engaging guide as she weaves personal anecdotes in the entries featuring 47 trails of varying levels of difficulty in and around Tucson. Put a copy in your guest room and tuck one into your day pack. You won't regret it.

“War for the Stars: End of Earth, Book 3” by Matt Simons (Independently published). 223 pp. $11.99 paperback; available in e-book.

Tucsonan Matt Simons says the story that has become his “End of the Earth” series came to him when he was a kid. It's evolved since. In this, Book 3, Earth is threatened by an interstellar alien species that has already conquered much of the galaxy. Thanks to the knowledge, Jason Baker passed to a friend in Book 2 — before he was flung back in time by a WW III nuclear blast — the U.S. has perfected a secret means to open corridors through space. Using that technology, Earth forces, led by four physically enhanced modern men and one 13,000-year-old one, will go to interstellar war.

You will like seeing Jason again, even though he's cast back in time to his pre-war innocence, and it's painful for him to be with the friends who would die before his eyes.

At the close of this volume, Simons invites readers to join him “as we slowly close in on The End of Earth. I'll be there.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=extraterrestrial","Does extraterrestrial life smell like the sea?","https://www.salon.com/2025/05/31/does-extraterrestrial-life-smell-like-the-sea/","Sat, 31 May 2025 09:30:00 GMT","

Dimethyl sulfide, also known as DMS, sounds like it could be a chemical compound you'd try to avoid on an ingredient label, or the poisonous ingredient in a murder mystery. But some scientists view this simple compound as a biosignature — a key indicator of life. So there was great excitement when DMS was discovered on a ""sub-Neptune planet"" far from our solar system – 124 light years away, or about 17 trillion miles, in the constellation Leo.

“We want to be a bit careful in claiming any evidence of life at this stage,” cautioned lead author Nikku Madhusudhan, of Cambridge University, about the findings he published last month in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, a publication of the American Astronomical Society, with other researchers from two American space institutes and two British physics and astronomy departments. 

“We have to look at a lot more molecules, and we have, and we couldn't come up with a much better explanation,” Madhusudhan told Salon in a video interview. He admits he can't be 100% certain that dimethyl sulfide, or (CH3)2S, exists on the planet called K2-18 b. But it looks very likely, as last month's research built on a paper published in 2023 that also found suggestions of DMS on the same planet but relied on different evidence.

But why would a random compound detected on a planet so far beyond our reach be a strong indicator of life? Well, let's consider the story of DMS on Earth, a story of the strange and poetic ways life appears and reappears in different guises — and with different scents.

Dimethyl sulfide is the largest natural source of atmospheric sulfur on Earth, which means that it gets into the atmosphere and cycles around. But it starts its journey in the ocean. You're absolutely familiar with DMS, even if you've never heard of it before. It's the source of the smell of the sea, that sort of fishy, sort of eggy aroma that evokes deeply nostalgic reactions in, well, almost everyone.

Interesting pushback came from Christophe Laudamiel, a master perfumer at Generation by Osmo. “I have personally never used that ingredient for the smell of the sea,” he told Salon by email. “It would be rather used for 'hot' smells and for ripe to overripe smells."" He compared the odor of DMS to ""fish that stayed too long in the sun,"" adding, quite understandably, that ""we usually avoid"" such associations ""when we recreate the smell of the sea in perfumery.""

Related

Rather than relying on those fish-rotting-in-sun odors to get ocean-smelling perfume, suggested Generation by Osmo founder and CEO Alex Wiltschow (also by email), ""We combine aquatic notes with mineral wet stone notes, salty notes and clean air notes,"" along with, perhaps, ""a touch of seaweed absolute as well or mossy top notes."" 

Similarly environment-evoking are the substances geosmin and petrichor. Petrichor is the pleasant, earthy aroma of rain falling on dry soil, sometimes described more simply as the smell of rain. That word has almost become trendy. In fact its use appears to have skyrocketed in the past quarter-century, though it was coined in the journal Nature in 1964. Like geosmin, the substance that gives earth its characteristic ""earthy"" odor, petrichor remains close to the ground. Dimethyl sulfide, however, gets around. 

The DMS that cycles around our world is produced, for the most part, by marine organisms, most notably the microscopic plants known as phytoplankton that live in the nutrient-rich upper layer of the ocean. These tiny organism exist in abundance, which is why DMS is responsible for most of that smell we associate with the seaside.

From the surface layer of the Earth's oceans, DMS, which is a volatile chemical, escapes into the air, joining the atmospheric cycling of sulfur. As one researcher describes this process, once in the atmosphere DMS ""has other major effects, being the 'seed' that sets off cloud formation over the oceans. Indeed, the production of this molecule is on such a scale that it has major effects on the world's climate, thanks to its effect on the cloud cover over the oceans.”

That quotation is nearly 20 years old, but scientists still don't know exactly to what extent DMS is responsible for seeding clouds, just that it's a significant factor. The tiny aerosol particles formed when DMS molecules are zapped by sunlight and other molecules in the atmosphere, which become the “seeds” for clouds, also exert meaningful effects on our climate by reflecting sunlight back into space.

In 2007, scientists at the University of East Anglia discovered that a single gene could produce dimethyl sulfide from dimethylsulfoniopropionate, or DMSP, the food that phytoplankton eat. As described in a paper in Science, you can take that gene, which has the catchy name dddD, from bacteria that live in the sea, or find it in other species of bacteria that hang out with plants instead but also produce DMS. Once you've found a bacterium with the dddD gene, you can clone it and stick it into an E.coli bacterium, which will then happily produce dimethyl sulfide. The aforementioned predecessor chemical DMSP is found, by the billions of tons, all over the world's oceans, seas and seashores. Marine plants and phytoplankton use it to protect themselves from the saltiness of seawater, literally as a buffer against stress. When these tiny plants die, some of their DMSP becomes available, as food for other bacteria. Terrestrial plants may also have symbiotic bacteria living in their root systems, which produce dimethyl sulfide from the DMSP released when their hosts die.

A master perfumer compares the odor of DMS to ""fish that stayed too long in the sun,"" adding that ""we usually avoid"" such associations ""when we recreate the smell of the sea in perfumery.""

This process — one kind of organism dies, offering sustenance to others — is how this cycle begins, at least on Earth. (If you can actually say that a cycle has a beginning or an end.) As one of the East Anglia scientists, Andrew Johnston, wrote in a 2007 project funding proposal, describing the role of DMS in seeding clouds, its importance has been known since 1971, ""with some 30 million tons of it being liberated into the air, worldwide, every year.” 

Aquatic bird species such as sea petrels and shearwaters are attracted to the ripe-fish aroma, while Johnston later discovered that the Atlantic herring has strains of bacteria in its gut microbiome called Pseudomonas and Psychrobacter, which digest DMSP and break it down into, yes, dimethyl sulfide. How did those bacteria get inside a fish? Herring eat small plants known as mesozooplankton, which themselves eat the much smaller phytoplankton. This familiar ecological pattern — bigger creatures eating smaller creature — has internalized the production of this evocative and volatile gas.

Thanks to the food chain, it seems, the creation dimethyl sulfide can take place not just in the surface layer of the ocean, but inside herring guts as well. Herrings are vertebrates, in the greater evolutionary scheme not all that different from us. Does this mean that humans also have the potential to create sulfurous stinks from our own insides? Well, there's no evidence at this point that our microbiomes contain DMS-producing bacteria. But that's ok. As you may be aware, our species can produce our own glorious forms of stink.

Dimethyl sulfide is an essential element in the characteristic odors of blood, serum, tissues, urine and breath in people (and rats). Not to mention the distinctive smell of feces and flatus, i.e., farts.

Let's mention here that dimethyl sulfide is emitted during wildfires, and so contributes to a scent that has grown chillingly familiar in many parts of North America in recent years. It's also largely responsible for the smell of the delicately-named dead horse arum, a relative of the so-called corpse flower, or titan arum.

Other flowers with unappetizing odors use different chemicals as their top notes, all with the purpose of attracting pollinators drawn to the aroma of their preferred type of rotting meat. Here for example is Wikipedia's almost lyrical rundown of the various sources of the corpse flower's scent: “Analyses of chemicals released by the spadix show the stench includes dimethyl trisulfide (like limburger cheese), dimethyl disulfide (garlic), trimethylamine (rotting fish), isovaleric acid (sweaty socks), benzyl alcohol (sweet floral scent), phenol (like Chloraseptic), and indole (like feces).” Scientists comparing the molecules involved in producing the stench of dead horse arum with those produced by a rotting corpse found that dimethyl sulfide was associated with the middle stage of decomposition in actual corpses (to be clear, this involved dead mice, not dead horses or human cadavers). 

All this odoriferous research has convinced some scientists that DMS is intimately associated with life, making it an ideal biosignature if found hundreds of light years away on some lonely planet. 

Critics of Madhusudhan's findings point out, however, that dimethyl sulfide can exist without demonstrating life at all. For one thing, you can make it in a lab.

As the perfumer Laudamiel told Salon, DMS is ""often used in perfumery, but not for its low-tide, rotten egg facet.” The human nose can detect one part per million of DMS, as an unpleasant, cabbage-like smell used, for example, to add a warning signal to the poisonous gas carbon monoxide, which is otherwise odorless natural gas. DMS also results from kraft pulping, producing a ghastly, retch-inducing smell you'll have noticed if you've ever driven by a paper processing plant. It's produced naturally as bacteria do their work on dimethyl sulfoxide waste in sewers.

When it's not saving us from asphyxiation or carrying out useful industrial processes, dimethyl sulfide also lends its ""low-tide, rotten egg facet"" as a nearly subconscious flavor in food and drinks, measured in a few parts per million. In brewing certain lagers, though, breweries may want that slightly funky flavor, and add enough DMS to cross the flavor threshold as a hint of the ocean (or of distant rotten eggs, or cabbage).  

The natural production of DMS is also medically useful. It turns out that as a kind of bacteria turns from existing peacefully in our mouths to causing colon cancer in our nether regions, it produces dimethyl sulfide. Worsening osteoporosis in older women may lead to exhaling DMS, as can the positive effects of a medication cocktail for children with cystic fibrosis.

""Just because you find something in a comet doesn't mean that it can't be a biosignature on a planetary atmosphere, because those are two very different environments.""

But how is it that the compound that gives us the glorious smell of the sea — and just perhaps, our first evidence of life on a distant planet — also provides the generally disagreeable fragrance of flatus, feces and flowers that smell like rotting meat?

“It works just like salt in a cake,"" explained Laudamiel. ""In combination with other molecules, at low, unrecognizable dosages, it brings out the flavors of other facets."" Unpleasant-sounding flavor notes such as ""the overripe 'vomity' note found naturally in papaya ... the 'feet' note found in Parmigiano or the 'sweaty' note found naturally in dark chocolate"" produce magical effects in combination with others and in just the right amount. Remove those notes, he concluded, and your papaya, cheese or chocolate will ""taste much less yummy."" Indeed, DMS, provided by nature at just the right dosage, is a component in the much coveted scent of truffles.

Turning away from our planet with its stinky-feet cheese, vomity papayas and sweaty chocolate, and turning to the stars, DMS is used as an additive in rocket fuel, added to ethylene oxide to prevent exhaust nozzles getting dirty and stop carbon building up on firing-chamber surfaces. 

But no existing or planned spacecraft can get us anywhere near the next possible known source of dimethyl sulfide on K2-18 b, the planet where Madhusudhan and colleagues have found, thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope, what they think could well be this signature of life.

Astronomers these days are really interested in sub-Neptune planets, meaning those with diameters larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. It's an exotic niche that doesn't exist in our solar system, and could offer new possibilities for finding life. They're particularly interested in a newly-defined type of planet that could exist within that range: Hycean worlds, which would possess water-rich interiors, planet-spanning oceans and atmospheres rich in hydrogen gas. The Madhusudhan team's detection of methane and carbon dioxide gases on K2-18 b supports his argument that the planet might have surface water, as does the fact that they did not find ammonia, which is soluble in water — if that's detected in the atmosphere, there probably isn't an ocean.  

We need your help to stay independent

But while DMS is a biosignature here on Earth, other scientists point out that it could be cooked up by some other process elsewhere, just as it can be produced in a laboratory for industrial purposes. Some scientists have suggested other possible explanations for the signals found by Madhusudhan's team, including statistical noise. Two findings within the past year bolster these criticisms. One, described last October, is the presence of dimethyl sulfide in a comet named 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which no one would argue suggests biological activity. 

Madhusudhan says that does nothing to disprove his hypothesis; comets are known to be little laboratories that can cook up all sorts of unlikely things. “The same comet also has molecular oxygen in it, right?” he countered. “It also has methane and other molecules, including amino acids."" Finding something in a comet, he said, ""doesn't mean that it can't be a biosignature in a planetary atmosphere, because those are two very different environments.""

Another finding that may cast doubt on the idea that DMS equates to the presence of life is the discovery of dimethyl sulfide, which here on Earth makes the sea smell like the sea, drifting around in deep space between the stars. Reporting on the open science platform Arxiv in February, an international group of astronomers said they found DMS during an ultra-deep molecular line survey, which uses fancy telescopes to look at a spectrum of wavelengths in one particular stretch of outer space and then catalog its chemical composition and physical properties, such as temperature and density. In this case, they pointed their telescopes toward a Galactic Center molecular cloud named G+0.693-0.027.

And there they found dimethyl sulfide, just vibing in the void.

NASA's originally planned lander to Europa was cancelled in 2023, but the technology behind it could be used to explore Enceladus instead, the organization has announced. Called the Europa Clipper, it was initially scheduled to arrive at Europa in 2030, and despite successful testing of a prototype, Europa was deemed too hostile for mission success.

So, why was there all the interest in the first place? Well, Europa (a moon of Jupiter) and Enceladus (a moon of Saturn) both have subsurface oceans beneath their icy crusts. 

These oceans might harbor life, making them two of the most promising places to look for extraterrestrial life in our solar system. NASA's Europa Clipper mission, should it have gone ahead, would have gathered data about Europa's potential habitability.

The original plan was that if the Clipper found good evidence (such as signs of water chemistry suitable for life), then a robotic lander might be sent to search for biosignatures. Or, in other words, signs of life.

But this wouldn't have been an easy mission for the team or the lander. Europa suffers from intense radiation from Jupiter, which damages electronics. There would also be limited communication time due to Europa's orbit, less than half of each 85-hour day.

The lander would also have to rely solely on battery power, as solar panels would need to be restrictively big, given the distance from the Sun. The surface is also extremely cold (−224°F to −364°F or −160°C to −220°C) and would lack communication satellites orbiting the moon to help relay data.

Yet despite the challenges, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) built a prototype robot to prepare for a possible Europa landing. This lander features legs that enable it to land and operate on Europa's icy surface safely.

It also features a stereoscopic camera with lights to enable “see” and navigation, as well as a special drill arm equipped with sensors to prevent breakage. One of its primary tools is the so-called “ICEPICK” tool, which allows for the collection of samples up to 7.87 inches (20 cm) deep.

The lander also features autonomous software to help it decide what to do with limited power and time, as well as control individual movements and operations. It passed rigorous field tests on Alaska's Matanuska Glacier (which has harsh, icy terrain similar to Europa).

In 2023, the new planetary science decadal strategy (which sets NASA's 10-year priorities) did not recommend the Europa lander. Europa's radiation made it unlikely that biosignatures could survive long enough to be detectable on the surface.

But the story isn't over for the lander; it may make an appearance on Enceladus instead. This moon of Jupiter has less radiation than Europa and potentially has water plumes that contain molecules needed for life.

For these reasons, its surface might preserve biosignatures longer. To this end, much of the robot design and lessons learned from Europa tests can be reused for a mission to Enceladus.

The dream of exploring Europa's deep ocean with a submersible still lives, but it's a giant technological leap. For now, flybys and landings on more accessible moons like Enceladus are more feasible.

The study has been published in the journal Science Robotics.

Supernatural ended after 15 seasons, but the fact that the franchise retconned Dean Winchester's ending two years later shows how easily the series can return. Every season of Supernatural built its fan base from small and cult-like to a pop culture icon, with the ending igniting inevitable controversy. Running from 2005 to 2020, the show was led by Jensen Ackles as Dean Winchester and Jared Padalecki as Sam Winchester, and a lot of people didn't want to see it end.

Airing on November 19, 2020, the Supernatural season 15 finale saw the Winchester brothers defeating the final boss - God himself. The stakes couldn't get any higher. Then, in a move that some saw as anticlimactic and others saw as perfectly fitting, Dean eventually died in a run-of-the-mill vampire hunt. Sam grew old and eventually joined Dean and Bobby in heaven. Cast, crew, and fans alike have long debated the possibility of a return for Supernatural, be it in another season, a movie, or a reboot. But The Winchesters made it clear just how easy this would be.

 Perhaps the most important of the Supernatural spinoffs is The Winchesters, which brought Dean Winchester back onto screens two years after Supernatural ended. Developed by Robbie Thompson with Ackles serving as executive producer, The Winchesters followed a young John and Mary. However, the spinoff was seemingly deviating from canon, particularly regarding Mary's past and how much she knew about John and the threats their family would face.

But at the end, it was revealed that Dean, who was narrating the story, had been in heaven, searching for a world where the Winchesters had a happy ending. In other words, The Winchesters took place in an alternate universe. Dean had fought threats to the multiverse that he encountered along the way, proving how easily he could return to the story.

Sam and Dean Winchester had a jarring ending that took many by surprise. Fortunately, despite its flaws, The Winchesters provided some more closure to it. Dean had died abruptly, and Sam's long life and eventual death were encapsulated in one episode. This may have felt like an insufficient end to a fifteen-year series, but The Winchesters was determined to add some clarity and potential to the fates of the brothers.

The Winchesters paraded as a prequel story, but in reality, it was a Supernatural epilogue.

Elaborating on Dean's time in heaven, The Winchesters confirmed that Dean was still saving the world, even after his death. This made his death easier to handle and opened up the possibility of a comeback.

The Winchesters paraded as a prequel story, but in reality, it was a Supernatural epilogue, and its handling of Dean Winchester's story proves how easily the franchise could return. Eric Kripke has said that he won't bring Supernatural back unless he has a good story for it (Collider). However, The Winchesters set one up. The show may have been canceled for various reasons, but one thing it did well was establish a foundation for the Winchesters in a Supernatural season 16 or reboot. Dean, Sam, and Bobby are together again, and still a thorn in evil's side.

Dean Winchester was killed in the controversial Supernatural series finale, but the franchise gave him a more fitting epilogue two years later.

Supernatural writer and producer Robbie Thompson and Supernatural star Jensen Ackles were well-situated to build on the original show for a new series. They did so well, despite whatever problems The Winchesters may have had. A new season, movie, or reboot of Supernatural can explore the multiverse and what Sam, Dean, and Bobby got up to in heaven. The Winchesters is just one of many examples of how death is not really an ending in Supernatural, and how, if there were to be a new season, Sam and Dean could easily return.

A satisfactory sci-fi ending is hard to come by these days, which makes HBO's single-season post apocalyptic epic such a treat for audiences.

The Last of Us's finale episode saw Ellie continue her search for Abby, but she briefly ran afoul of the Seraphite group and was almost killed.  

Scarlett Johansson's time as Black Widow in the MCU may be done, but her return to the franchise could still be possible in a behind-the-scenes role.

Mary makes a heartwarming decision in Georgie & Mandy's First Marriage season 1 finale, but it comes with a blatant lie that ties to her TBBT future. 

The Handmaid's Tale showrunners explain the one June reunion that couldn't happen in the series finale and why the storyline wasn't fully resolved.

What Is a Psychic Medium? Understanding the Gift of Spirit Communication



In today's spiritual landscape, the terms “psychic” and “psychic medium” are often used interchangeably, but they represent distinct abilities. A psychic medium is someone who not only possesses heightened intuitive senses but also serves as a bridge between the physical and spiritual realms. While a general psychic might focus on predicting future events, interpreting energy, or giving insight into relationships, a psychic medium specializes in spirit communication—connecting with souls who have passed on.

What Is a Psychic Medium?

A psychic medium is an individual with the unique spiritual gift of perceiving and relaying messages from people in the afterlife. While all mediums are psychics, not all psychics are mediums. Psychics receive intuitive insight about a person's life, but mediums go deeper by channeling spirits, helping clients receive messages from deceased loved ones or spiritual guides.

This form of intuitive communication has been a part of human culture for centuries, from ancient shamans to modern-day mediums and psychics conducting readings via online platforms or spiritual centers. In 2025, digital technology has brought this practice to even more people, with psychic mediums online offering accessible, one-on-one medium readings through chat or phone.

How Do Psychic Mediums Connect With the Spirit World?

Psychic mediums use a combination of heightened senses, energetic alignment, and spiritual attunement to receive information from beyond the veil. Many report entering altered states of consciousness, clearing their energy fields, and opening their mind to receive intuitive impressions from spirits.

Some common types of mediumship include:

Each medium reader develops their own skill set, and many use a combination of these abilities during a session. The result is often a powerful, validating experience that brings emotional comfort and insight.

A psychic medium reading can be a deeply emotional and transformative experience, especially if it's your first time connecting with a medium reader. Whether you're seeking closure, guidance, or simply exploring your spiritual side, proper preparation can enhance the quality and clarity of your session.

⇒ Find clarity through psychic mediums chat today

Before Your Reading: Mindset, Setting & Intentions

1. Clear Your MindsetApproach the session with openness, not expectation. Spirit communication doesn't always follow a script—sometimes, the message you need is different from the one you want. Let go of rigid demands and allow the energy to flow naturally.

2. Choose a Calm SettingWhether your session is over the phone or with a psychic medium online, pick a quiet, comfortable space where you won't be disturbed. Light a candle, play soft music, or sit silently for a few minutes to center yourself.

3. Set Clear Intentions

Ask yourself:

  

You don't need to share your full intentions with the medium, but having clarity in your heart can help guide the session's energy.

⇒ Discover real psychic mediums online you can trust

During the Reading: Stay Open & Observe Validation

1. Expect a Variety of MessagesPsychic medium readings often start with small validations—names, memories, or details only you would know. These are signs that a loved one or spirit guide is present. Messages can be symbolic, metaphorical, or very direct.

2. Ask Open-Ended QuestionsInstead of “Will I get the job?” ask, “What energy surrounds my career path right now?” It allows the medium reader to share insights without being boxed into a yes/no framework and invites a more intuitive flow of guidance.

3. Don't Try to “Test” the MediumSkepticism is natural, but challenging a medium with trick questions can block the connection. Spirit communication requires trust, patience, and cooperation on both ends.

⇒ Explore psychic medium readings that bring healing

After the Reading: Reflect, Record & Integrate

1. Take Notes ImmediatelyWrite down everything you remember—names, phrases, images, emotions. Even if something seems unclear, it may click later or carry meaning in future days.

2. Reflect on the EnergyHow did the experience make you feel? Did you sense peace, relief, surprise, or deep emotion? Trust those responses—they're part of your spiritual journey.

3. Allow for Ongoing GuidanceThe trusted psychic medium sessions often leave a lasting impression. Messages may continue to unfold through dreams, signs, or spontaneous memories. Stay aware and open.

How Accurate Are Psychic Mediums? Debunking Myths & Understanding Validation

In a world where spiritual guidance and emotional healing are increasingly sought after, many wonder: How accurate are psychic mediums? Are they truly connecting with spirit, or is it all just clever guesswork?At The-Psychic-Experts.com, we've researched and reviewed countless psychic medium readings to understand what makes a session authentic. Here's what you need to know about accuracy, common myths, and how real medium readers validate their gift.

Understanding How Psychic Mediums Work

A psychic medium is not just a general psychic who reads energy—they are spiritual communicators who connect with the spirit realm. Unlike tarot readers or astrologers who use tools, psychic mediums receive messages through extrasensory channels such as:

  

These messages often come in symbols or sensations that the medium reader interprets based on intuition and experience.

Common Myths About Medium Accuracy

MYTH 1: All Mediums Should Be 100% AccurateNo psychic medium is perfect. The spirit world communicates through energy, which can be subtle, symbolic, or fragmented. Accuracy can also depend on the connection between the client and the medium, the presence of spirit, and even emotional readiness to receive a message.

MYTH 2: If They Ask Questions, They're Faking ItGood medium psychics may ask clarifying questions to ensure they interpret symbols correctly. It's not fishing—it's collaboration. Spirit often gives vague or layered imagery that needs client feedback to make sense.

MYTH 3: All Psychics Are ScammersWhile frauds exist, the trusted psychic mediums are honest about their limitations. They'll never guarantee specific outcomes or manipulate emotions. Look for transparency, empathy, and a clear code of ethics.

How to Tell If a Psychic Medium Is Real or Fake

Finding someone truly gifted can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack in the growing world of psychic medium readings. As more people explore medium and psychic readings online, it's crucial to separate genuine psychic mediums from those using cold reading tricks or vague guesswork.

Here's how to tell if a psychic medium is the real deal—and how to protect yourself from scams, especially when trying a free psychic medium reading online.

⇒ Find trusted guidance through psychic medium readings

1. They Offer Specific, Validating Information

A real medium doesn't rely on broad generalizations like “I sense someone with the letter J.” Instead, they may deliver:

  

A credible medium reader may also ask you to validate the information instead of fishing for clues.

2. They're Transparent About Their Process

Authentic medium psychics don't pretend to be all-knowing. They'll likely explain how spirit messages come through (e.g., clairaudience, clairsentience, symbols, impressions) and will humbly admit if they don't understand something.

Avoid anyone who:

  

The trusted psychic medium reads with compassion, not pressure.

⇒ Get peace of mind with psychic mediums chat support

3. Their Energy Feels Safe and Grounded

Intuition is your strongest tool. Ask yourself:

  

Genuine psychic mediums offer messages with empathy, not ego.

4. They Don't Need to Know Anything About You

A real psychic medium doesn't need your full name, birth date, or backstory to connect with the spirit. Many prefer to know as little as possible to keep the reading pure.

Be wary if a reader asks excessive personal questions before your session, especially during a free medium reading trial.

5. Their Free Reading Has Real Value

Legit psychic medium online services often offer a free psychic medium reading to demonstrate their ability and help you decide whether to continue.

Even in a short 3–5-minute session, a real medium may:

⇒ Get peace of mind with psychic mediums chat support

6. They Don't Play on Grief or Fear

Mediums work with delicate emotional territory. Reputable mediums and psychics never use your grief as leverage. They won't tell you your loved one is “trapped” or that you must pay more to “complete” a message.

Authentic psychic medium readings bring healing and empowerment, not dependency or fear.

7. Reviews Focus on Connection, Not Hype

Look for testimonials that describe:

Be cautious of reviews that overuse buzzwords like “miracle” or “life-changing” without explaining why.

Trust Your Gut. Then Trust Spirit.

Ultimately, your intuition is the most important filter for finding the trusted psychic medium. If something feels off, it probably is. If something feels warm, peaceful, and resonant, it's likely worth exploring.

Johnson

U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson has again waded into long-debunked conspiracy theories, suggesting without evidence that someone, presumably with the government, imploded one of the buildings destroyed in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks hours after the Twin Towers collapsed.

Speaking with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson on Wednesday, Johnson, R-Oshkosh, said his interest in the attack on New York City, particularly regarding Building 7, a 47-story office building that fell several hours after planes were flown into the nearby Twin Towers, is “because the 9/11 families want to know the answer.”

“I'm just as prone as everyone else to go, ‘Well, that's wacko. That's a conspiracy,'” Johnson said. “But then you start getting the information and you start going, ‘Wow, is that weird.'”

“Building number 7 — you see it come down — and we've all watched, because it's cool to watch these buildings being demolished, boom, just freefall,” Johnson said. “The only way that happens is if you remove all of their supports at the same time. You blow them all out so a building can really free-fall. If it's collapsing from something else, it's like, you know, you build like a fire, and it collapses off to the side or something, right?”

The National Institute of Standards and Testing concluded that uncontrolled fires caused by debris from one of the center's Twin Towers caused steel beams and girders to expand, “leading to a chain of events that caused a key structural column to fail.

“The failure of this structural column then initiated a fire-induced progressive collapse of the entire building,” the group stated in the final report on its investigation.

Speaking with conservative radio host Meg Ellefson a day later, Johnson again cited the 2020 film “Calling Out Bravo 7,” a production he's referenced in the past that questions the official story behind the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 in New York.

“And as we find out, in so many different instances, you really can't trust the government what they told you,” Johnson said. “I mean, the government has just repeatedly lied to the American public for decades on so many different issues. It's sad. It shouldn't happen, but it does.”

In a statement, Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokesperson Phil Shulman criticized Johnson's remarks.

“Almost 3,000 Americans died in the 9/11 attacks — and Ron Johnson thinks it's ‘cool' to watch buildings collapse as a result of the worst terrorist attack on American soil,” Shulman said. “It seems Ron Johnson could not care less about the devastation these attacks caused on our country.”

Johnson's latest comments come about a month after the the Oshkosh Republican told conservative podcaster Benny Johnson he believes there are “an awful lot of questions” surrounding one of the deadliest attacks on the United States.

Johnson, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, has called for more congressional hearings on the attacks while also criticizing as “corrupt” the investigation carried out by the standards and technology institute.

The institute's final report was the work of more than 200 experts, including scientists and engineers, and found that Building 7 collapsed due to the hours-long fire that consumed much of the building and inadequate water pressure to combat the fire.

“Had a water supply for the automatic sprinkler system been available and had the sprinkler system operated as designed, it is likely that fires in (Building 7) would have been controlled and the collapse prevented,” the report states.

""I mean, the government has just repeatedly lied to the American public for decades on so many different issues. It's sad. It shouldn't happen, but it does.""

Friday brought the most anticipated game of the 2025 MLB season to date, as the New York Yankees traveled to Chavez Ravine for a World Series rematch against the Los Angeles Dodgers. And it didn't take long for it to live up to the billing: Aaron Judge went yard in the game's second at-bat. 

And then, not to be outdone, Shohei Ohtani followed suit on the very first pitch of the bottom half.

The sport's two best hitters, both going deep before everyone had even gotten to their seats. But that was just the beginning of the fireworks: There were five homers just in the first three innings of this game, with Austin Wells, Trent Grisham and Paul Goldschmidt all going yard to help New York build an early 5-2 lead. 

Two massive media markets? Check. The game's two biggest stars? Check. A slew of highlight-reel plays? Check. Rob Manfred himself could hardly have written a more perfect opening script for the most significant game of the year. In fact, maybe the script was a little too perfect — and baseball fans couldn't help but take notice.

For more news and rumors, check out MLB Insider Robert Murray's work on The Baseball Insiders podcast, subscribe to The Moonshot, our weekly MLB newsletter, and join the discord to get the inside scoop during the MLB season.

Allegations that MLB was ""juicing"" its baseballs in order to increase offense first picked up steam in the late 2010s, amid a resurgence in home runs around the league. Manfred himself more or less confirmed the theory at the 2019 All-Star Game, admitting that ""our scientists that have been now studying the baseball more regularly have told us that this year the baseball has a little less drag.""

As the years went by and MLB revamped its production process and the pendulum swung back in favor of pitchers, the fervor all but died away. But all it took was a rash of suspiciously effortless homers between the league's two richest franchises in order to make everybody a believer again.

Is it likely that MLB saw to it that unique balls found their way to Dodger Stadium ahead of this weekend? Not really. Then again, when you've already been proven to have tinkered with the baseballs previously — and when a certain kind of baseball already found its way to Judge and the Yankees during his chase for the AL home run record back in 2022 — you've forfeited the benefit of the doubt.

This is a perception problem more than anything. Manfred is a figure that fans have never been able to trust, both because he has a hard time communicating clearly and effectively and also because he has a habit of doing some head-scratching stuff. Overall, it gives the impression that the league is making things up as they go along and doesn't have any qualms about putting its thumb on the scale. From there, it's only natural for conspiracy theories to take root.

Great eared nightjars live on the forest floor, remaining motionless throughout the day, camouflaged among leaf litter and tree stumps.

Name: Great eared nightjar (Lyncornis macrotis)

Where it lives: Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam

What it eats: Moths, beetles and other flying insects

With its large, forward-facing eyes and head tufts that look like ears, the great eared nightjar resembles a dragon more than a bird. Often nicknamed the ""baby dragon,"" this otherworldly-looking creature has several distinctive traits, including an eerie, haunting call.

Great eared nightjars, which reach between 12 and 16 inches (30 to 40 centimeters) in length, live in dense, low-lying woodlands across South and Southeast Asia. These elusive, nocturnal birds are masters of camouflage and blend into the forest floor, thanks to their mottled brown, gray and black plumage. By day, they remain motionless among leaf litter or tree stumps, with their coloring protecting them from predators.

Rather than building a traditional nest, the great eared nightjar lays a single egg directly on the forest floor or in a shallow bed of leaves. While the exact reason they avoid nesting in trees like many other birds remains uncertain, it's likely that their natural camouflage offers effective protection for both egg and chick against predators.

Their habitat is often dense with vegetation and trees, making it difficult for predators to find the birds and their eggs. Both parents incubate the egg until it hatches. Once the chick has emerged, it remains camouflaged on the forest floor where it is fed by its parents until it can fend for itself.

Despite their dragon-like appearance, great eared nightjars feed primarily on moths and other flying insects, which they catch mid-air in the twilight hours using their wide, gaping mouths. Their flight is silent and smooth, allowing them to hunt quickly and efficiently without alerting predators, such as owls and other birds of prey.

The call of the great eared nightjar is a deep, haunting sound that echoes through the forest at dusk and dawn. This distinctive call includes a sharp ""tsiik"" noise followed by a pause and a longer, whistle-like call. Nightjars rely on these vocalizations to breed. Males often use their calls to mark their territories, attract mates or warn others of dangers.

Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, capitalism has unleashed unimaginable growth in opportunity and prosperity. And yet, at key points in American history, economic disruption has led to a greater role for government, ostensibly to protect against capitalism's excesses. Today, government regulates, mandates, subsidizes and controls a growing share of the American economy.

Today on the show, retired U.S. Senator Phil Gramm, one of America's premier public policy advocates, and noted economist Donald J. Boudreaux look at the seven events and issues in American history that define, for most Americans, the role of government and how the 21st century world works.

To many, these 5 periods of American history—the Industrial Revolution, Progressive Era, Great Depression, decline of America's postwar preeminence in world trade, and the Great Recession—along with the existing levels of income inequality and poverty, represent strong evidence for expanding government in American life. Gramm and Boudreaux argue that the evidence might point to a contrary verdict.

Phil Gramm served six years in the U.S. House of Representatives and eighteen years in the U.S. Senate where he was Chairman of the Banking Committee. Gramm is a Visiting Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. He was Vice Chairman of UBS Investment Bank and is now Vice Chairman of Lone Star Funds. He taught Economics at Texas A&M University and has published numerous articles and books.

Donald J. Boudreaux is an American economist, author, professor, and co-director of the Program on the American Economy and Globalization at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. His writings have appeared in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Investor's Business Daily, The Washington Times, and many scholarly publications.

Their new book is The Triumph of Economic Freedom: Debunking the Seven Great Myths of American Capitalism.

It has been clear from the very beginning of the Ukraine conflict that Russia cannot be defeated, particularly due to its nuclear status, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has told the SZ newspaper.

Kiev's Western backers, including top officials in Germany, France, and the UK, as well as the US under former President Joe Biden's administration, repeatedly stated the intent to inflict a “strategic defeat” on Moscow in the Ukraine conflict, or at least to ensure that it does not emerge victorious. That justification has been used to support continued military assistance to Kiev.

Wadephul admitted on Friday that it was obvious the conflict between Moscow and Kiev can only be resolved in a diplomatic way.

“It was clear from the beginning that this war would most likely end through a negotiated settlement,” Germany's top diplomat told SZ in a lengthy interview.

“One thing is true: a complete defeat in the sense of a capitulation by nuclear-armed Russia could not have been expected,” the minister stated, adding that “we have now become a little more honest” in this regard. He still maintained that Kiev's troops have been “successfully defending” against Moscow's forces, although the Ukrainian military has been losing ground along the entire front over the past several months.

The foreign minister maintained it was important to help Kiev get a “strong negotiating position” at peace talks and claimed that Russia was “threatening” Germany as he justified a planned military buildup and increase in defense expenditures. He also said that relations between Moscow and Berlin could no longer be described as a “clear peace situation.”

Berlin has taken an even more hardline position on Russia under new Chancellor Friedrich Merz. In the weeks since taking office, Merz has lifted range restrictions on Ukrainian strikes with German-supplied missiles and hinted at the possibility of providing Kiev with Taurus missiles, which have a range of 500km and could reach Moscow.

Germany has also announced a new military aid package for Kiev worth €5.2 billion ($5.6 billion), which Berlin says would be allocated mostly to long-range weaponry production inside Ukraine.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reacted to Merz's statements by saying that Berlin's “direct involvement in the war is now obvious.” Germany already followed a similar “slippery slope” a couple of times in the last century “down toward its own collapse,” he added.

French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on Friday, urged China to prevent its ally, North Korea, from deploying troops on “European soil” if it hopes to prevent an expanded NATO presence in Asia.

In April, Pyongyang admitted that its troops were assisting Moscow in liberating Kursk Region, which was invaded by Ukrainian forces last August but has since been reclaimed by Russia.

That month, Russian General Staff Chief Valery Gerasimov told President Vladimir Putin that North Korean troops had demonstrated “high professionalism, courage, and heroism” in the operation. During Moscow's Victory Day celebrations, Putin publicly thanked them for their defense of Kursk Region.

“But what's happening with North Korea being present alongside Russia on European soil is a big question for all of us,” Macron said. “If China doesn't want NATO being involved in Southeast Asia, they should clearly prevent the DPRK from being engaged on European soil,” he added.

Macron also reflected on his past stance, stating, “l had objected to NATO having any role in Asia because, for me, ‘N' is for North Atlantic, and I don't believe in being enrolled in someone else's strategic rivalry.”

France's resistance to the bloc's Asian expansion was evident when it led efforts to reject a proposed NATO office in Tokyo in 2023, with media reports citing Macron's vocal opposition.

At the time, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg hinted at opening the office in response to growing military ties between China and Russia, underscored by their joint patrols over the Sea of Japan and East China Sea, which had prompted South Korea and Japan to scramble fighter jets.

Last year, US President Joe Biden and other Western leaders urged Beijing to rein in Pyongyang's deepening military ties with Moscow, highlighting concerns regarding North Korea's growing involvement.

The US and South Korea condemned North Korea's admission of its role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. “With their public admission of the deployment, while claiming they are fully in accordance with international law, they are once again mocking the international community,” Seoul's foreign ministry said, according to Yonhap News Agency.

A US State Department spokesperson, citing Reuters, noted that Moscow's training of North Korean soldiers violates UN Security Council resolutions, and urged both nations to cease their unlawful cooperation.

From my vantage point, having recently attended the Kyiv International Cyber Resilience Forum (KICRF) and witnessing firsthand the unwavering determination in the face of relentless digital aggression, the situation unfolding in Ukraine's cyber domain demands our unvarnished attention.

The situation in Ukraine's cyber domain is not merely a theoretical exercise in network security; it directly impacts national sovereignty and societal resilience.

What I observed in Kyiv was a nation locked in a persistent cyber struggle, primarily against the Kremlin's digital legions — The Federal Security Service (FSB), Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) and the Russian criminal actors — now further complicated by a significant shift in the international support landscape. The U.S. government appears to be withdrawing from the cybersecurity battlefield as evidenced by its wholesale reduction in personnel within key government entities, including the Critical Infrastructure Security Agency, and directives from administration leadership not to have national resources focus on Russian cyber activities.

In addition to this, the unexpected closure of the USAID mission in Ukraine, leading to the reduction of support to Ukraine's ongoing cybersecurity efforts, casts a long shadow over Kyiv's digital defenses. This was further highlighted by the palpable concerns expressed during the KICRF and the embarrassing and inexplicable absence of U.S. government participation.

The Russian attacks on Ukraine are multifaceted, targeting critical infrastructure — power grids, telecom networks, the financial system — to inflict maximum disruption, all designed to erode public confidence.

One cannot forget that intelligence gathering remains a constant, insidious undertow. Add to that the weaponization of information and the relentless campaigns to pollute the information space, erode trust, and undermine Ukraine's narrative globally.

Then we have the repeated deployment of wiper malware — digital scorched earth tactics — underscoring the destructive intent. And while ransomware may have a profit motive, its impact on essential services amplifies the overall vulnerability.


Ukraine possesses a cadre of highly skilled cyber professionals, both within government agencies and the private sector, individuals who are actively engaged in the digital war.
    

However, amid this digital maelstrom, Ukraine demonstrates remarkable resilience and adaptability that demands significant attention and admiration. This is not a nation caught entirely off guard. Years of Russian aggression in the Donbas, the annexation of Crimea, and the 2015 attack on Ukraine's power grid all served as a training ground, forcing Kyiv to harden its digital defenses.

Crucially, the steady hand of international assistance — governments pooling resources through mechanisms like the Tallinn Accord, the strategic guidance of entities like the EU and NATO, and the often-unsung contributions of private sector cyber defenders — has provided a vital lifeline of expertise, technology, and funding.

And let me be clear, Ukraine possesses a cadre of highly skilled cyber professionals, both within government agencies and the private sector, individuals who are actively engaged in the digital war. Their agility, their ability to adapt to evolving threats in real-time, is a testament to their resolve. As we have seen, this adaptability and teamwork are foundational to their cyber resilience.

However, the cessation of USAID's programs, which included significant initiatives in cybersecurity for critical infrastructure and digital transformation — areas where sustained support is paramount — injects a new and unwelcome element of uncertainty. The loss of this funding stream will undoubtedly create gaps in Ukraine's ability to modernize its defenses, train its personnel, and implement crucial security measures. The growing dependence on other international partners intensifies, placing greater pressure on those who remain dedicated to upholding Ukraine's digital sovereignty.

This is where the global cyber ecosystem — both commercial and governmental, now operating with one less major player — faces a starker choice: stand by and watch the digital defenses fray or step into the breach with even greater resolve.

For Ukrainian tech companies, this is not just a crisis; it is an even more urgent imperative to innovate under pressure. The demand for tailored cybersecurity solutions — threat intelligence platforms with local context, rapid incident response capabilities, and secure communication channels designed for a hostile environment — is now amplified.

Investing in the next generation of cyber defenders through robust training and education programs is paramount. Strategic alliances with trusted international partners are no longer a luxury; they are a necessity for accelerated technology and knowledge transfer.

For international companies, the call to action is now imbued with a greater sense of urgency.

Providing Ukraine with access to the sharpest cyber tools — AI-driven threat detection, advanced endpoint protection, resilient cloud infrastructure — isn't just good PR; it is a strategic necessity to compensate for the receding U.S. presence.

Investing in Ukraine's tech sector, establishing a local footprint, or forging genuine partnerships contributes to long-term stability and fills a growing void. More is needed to offset the USAID withdrawal.

The timely sharing of actionable threat intelligence is a cornerstone of the collective digital defense, now even more critical with potentially reduced intelligence sharing through formal U.S. channels. Supporting and contributing to cybersecurity education initiatives helps build a sustainable talent pipeline, which is crucial in light of potential limitations in U.S.-funded programs. Engaging in meaningful public-private partnerships and leveraging the unique strengths of all stakeholders are the only ways to build truly resilient defenses in this evolving landscape.

Russia's cyber activity knows no geographic boundary. We must reject the notion that Russia's illegal war targets only Ukraine; Russia is at war with everyone.

This is not about charity; it is about safeguarding the integrity of the global digital commons in the face of a persistent and emboldened adversary whose digital reach extends far beyond the physical borders of Ukraine. The imperative — and the heightened responsibility – to act decisively is now upon us. The unexpected withdrawal of a major player, the United States, only amplifies the urgency for others to step forward and fill the digital breach, recognizing that the digital front line in Ukraine is a frontline for us all.

Residents in the Lötschental valley have been asked to prepare for evacuation. It comes after Wednesday's glacier collapse dumped millions of cubic meters of ice, rock and mud.

A number of Alpine communities in Switzerland's Lötschental valley have been asked to be ready to evacuate their homes following a massive landslide on Wednesday.

Rivers in the area have become swollen and have dammed up behind the rubble, rock and ice that thundered down into the valley after the Birch Glacier began to collapse in the southwestern canton of Valais.

""We ask residents to make personal preparations so that they can leave their homes as quickly as possible,"" the municipalities of Steg-Hohtenn and Gampel-Bratsch in the Lötschental valley posted on their website late Thursday.

Wednesday's collapse saw millions of cubic meters of ice, mud and rock engulf the village of Blatten and authorities have yet to locate a 64-year-old man who has not been seen since the collapse.

Blatten's 300 residents were evacuated at short notice last week following an assessment by geologists that found that a landslide was imminent.

Local authorities suspended the search for the missing man on Thursday afternoon, as conditions became too dangerous with warnings of further rockfalls.

The debris has blocked the course of the River Lonza and has caused a lake to form, which in turn has heightened fears the mass could dislodge and impact communities further downstream.

Stephane Ganzer, head of the security division for the Valais canton, told reporters that water levels have been rising by 80 centimeters (31.5 inches) an hour as a result of the blockage.

The army is on standby with water pumps and earth-moving machinery and will get to work once conditions improve.

Slashed and paused funding, mass firings and information purges have destabilized crucial infrastructure for survivors.

Slashed and paused funding, mass firings and information purges have destabilized crucial infrastructure for survivors.

This story was originally published by The 19th.

Over the last four decades, the United States has built a web of federal policies and funding to address domestic and intimate partner violence, a pervasive health and safety crisis. 

In just 130 days, the Trump administration has put that safety net in jeopardy.

Funding pauses, cuts, firings and information purges have destabilized the infrastructure that helps victims of abuse. At the same time, federal teams dedicated to preventing sexual violence are being decimated. Departments in charge of administering grants that fund shelters for those fleeing assault have been deemed “duplicative, DEI or simply unnecessary.”

The first budget recommendation proposed by the administration of a man found liable for sexual abuse suggests eliminating the team tackling rape prevention and education. It takes a limited view of who is worthy of help to flee abuse. These changes limit how federal funds can be used to support survivors and emphasize criminal consequences for perpetrators over a more holistic view of justice.

The federal government has long recognized domestic violence and violence between romantic partners as a critical public health and safety issue. Four out of every 10 women say they've experienced violence at the hands of an intimate partner, according to a survey from the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Among men, a quarter reported being victims. Intimate partner violence can be deadly, particularly for women: More than half of all women homicide victims are killed by a current or former partner, according to a CDC study. 

In 1994, Congress recognized violence against women as a national crisis and passed a law that supercharged the government's funding and attention to the issue. They haven't solved the problem — but lawmakers and advocates say the Violence Against Women Act and its predecessor, the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, have been essential to the protection of victims and the decline in violent crime.

Federal grant programs are the lifeblood of domestic violence services programs — and they have been threatened since the day Trump returned to office.

His executive orders on gender and “illegal” diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility led to lists of banned words. Federal departments raced to sanitize their communications, eradicating decades of research and data.

Meanwhile, the Office of Management and Budget issued a short-lived freeze on funding distributions pending evaluation of programs for compliance with executive orders. Nonprofits that relied on federal funds to provide services to victims of domestic violence scrambled for legal advice: Was their budget at risk because they had a pride flag on their website? Did they also have to erase all mentions of banned words?

The National Domestic Violence Hotline, which is largely funded by appropriations from the Department of Health and Human Services, removed resources for LGBTQ+ survivors from its website. The majority of state domestic violence coalitions, the umbrella organizations that support direct service providers, took their websites offline — though when asked if it was related to Trump's actions, most declined to answer on the record. 

So far, there has only been one reported case of a grant from the Office on Violence Against Women being revoked, but hundreds of grants already issued by the Office of Justice Programs were abruptly canceled because they no longer aligned with the administration's priorities. Even while some of the cuts were reversed, the moves created uncertainty that makes it impossible for victims services organizations to plan, increasing the stresses of work that is already difficult and traumatic. 

Then it was not just current funding, but future provisions that came under fire. The Office on Violence Against Women removed all open notices of funding opportunities from its website on February 6. New versions weren't released for three months, disrupting the grant cycle that must conclude by September 30, the end of the government's financial year. Revised notices included major changes to department priorities and a longer list of activities ineligible for funding.

The U.S. attorney general has the authority to prioritize areas for grantmaking. Notices posted before Trump took office didn't have any; now applications are given bonus points in the review round if they “combat human trafficking and transnational crime, particularly crimes linked to illegal immigration and cartel operations” or seek to improve services in small towns, rural areas or tribal nations. 

The section defining what is ineligible for funding has ballooned. In addition to complying with executive orders on gender and DEI, the new restrictions put forth a more limited view of interventions around domestic violence. Activities that “frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses (e.g., prioritizing criminal justice reform or social justice theories over victim safety and offender accountability)” are banned, as well as activities that “discourage collaboration with law enforcement.” Initiatives that “prioritize illegal aliens over U.S. citizens” are also not allowed.

Rita Smith, an international expert on violence against women, is publicly raising the alarm about these changes. As the Office on Violence Against Women announces new grants on LinkedIn, Smith reshares them to her large network with a warning. 

“I think if people apply for these grants and they get them, it may open them up to the kind of scrutiny that they're not used to getting from the Department of Justice,” Smith said in an interview. She's worried that organizations will be subject to intrusive data collection or information gathering, especially around the immigration status of their clients. 

Smith used to work in direct services, and now has a more administrative role in the movement against domestic violence. “We never required anyone to show us their immigration papers,” she said. “We didn't ask for documentation if people said they were in danger. If they processed through the intake questions that we had, and we determined that they were in danger, we gave them shelter.”

“We didn't ask them for a green card. We didn't ask them for visas. We just brought them in to make them safe.”

The administration's priorities conflict with some recent moves to better reach diverse populations. The 2022 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act created a funding scheme for culturally specific service providers, which are tailored to the needs of Asian, Black, Native American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander or Latinx survivors. But how are those organizations supposed to operate when DEI is banned? How can nonprofits supporting LGBTQ+ survivors do their work without acknowledging the trans community? Guidance remains piecemeal and oftentimes unofficial — no one knows exactly how to bulletproof their organization. 

Smith sees the new restriction on funding as a way to redefine who is a victim in the eyes of the federal government. The requirements are so onerous that it can make it hard for nonprofits to serve their purpose: helping people escape violence.

Some organizations have made the decision to refuse federal funds because it comes with conditions antithetical to their mission. But the gaps left will be hard to fill.

When the Trump administration fired nearly every federal employee within the CDC's Division of Violence Prevention, it did away with the only team at the federal level working specifically on domestic and intimate partner violence prevention. 

The program they oversaw — called DELTA, or Domestic Violence Prevention Enhancements and Leadership Through Alliances — was first created in 2002 to harness federally funded research and expertise on the causes of intimate partner violence, along with the connections of state and local domestic violence groups, so fewer people become victims in the first place. 

Getting that work off the ground asked already strained groups trying to serve victims to shift some of their energy to prevention work, but staff at the CDC at the time, and until April, remained committed to what one laid-off worker referred to as the “cultural norms change” that's a key part of preventing domestic and intimate partner violence. 

Under DELTA, which currently funds 13 state-based domestic violence networks, the CDC helps state groups implement prevention programs and measures how successful they are at preventing violence. 

“If you remember taking a class on healthy relationships, or seeing PSA about domestic violence, or anything like that in your school or communities — those are some examples of our prevention work,” said one former federal worker within the Division of Violence Prevention who was part of the administration's “reduction in force.” They declined to be named out of fear of losing their remaining federal benefits.“People, I think, sometimes take it for granted, because it's just something that's there. But those kinds of things are going to go away, and no one is going to be there to teach our kids about healthy relationships or help communities reshape the norms around what's acceptable in how we treat one another.” 

“All of that stuff will be gone.” 

The administration has not clawed back funding for the current budget year from the 13 DELTA states, but staff in those states are doing without the expertise of staff at the CDC. The Trump administration has proposed slashing DELTA altogether next year, alongside the other programs under the Division of Violence Prevention, calling the spending “duplicative, DEI, or simply unnecessary.” 

The Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, which receives nearly half a million dollars in funding through DELTA, said the funding cut would be “catastrophic.” DELTA “is the only dedicated federal funding source for the primary prevention of domestic violence and a critical tool for driving real, lasting change,” said Jennifer Beittel, a spokesperson for the group. 

Hema Sarang-Sieminski, the executive director of Jane Doe Inc., the Massachusetts sexual assault and domestic violence coalition, said their CDC grant managers were all laid off. She found their advice and expertise invaluable; the team created resources for working with LGBTQ+ survivors and culturally specific communities. Jane Doe Inc.'s grant was for five years, and Sarang-Sieminski just reapplied, as required for year two. It's unclear what support her organization will have moving forward. 

Of the 61 million women nationwide who say they've experienced violence at the hands of a romantic partner, 16 million reported first experiencing it before they turned 18. The administration's staffing cuts and proposed budget cuts would also hit the CDC's team focused on teen dating violence. 

That team developed a program called “Dating Matters,” the first comprehensive teen dating violence prevention effort in the United States using funding appropriated by Congress. The funding came after several high-profile cases of dating violence, in particular the 2005 death of Rhode Island student Lindsay Ann Burke, whose boyfriend was convicted of her murder. Her parents became advocates for teen dating violence education efforts, arguing that their daughter may not have had enough information about the dynamics of abusive relationships before her death. 

One longitudinal study on 6th through 8th graders across four cities that adopted the CDC's Dating Matters model for middle school found that by the 11th grade, the program had no only reduced dating violence, but also sexual violence, harrassment, substance use and delinquency. In 2024, the team published a guide specifically for LGBTQ+ youth, who face higher rates of dating and sexual violence. 

In January, after Trump took office, those resources were deleted to comply with the executive order on “radical gender ideology.” By April, the whole team had been laid off. 

An update and rebrand of the Dating Matters program was slated to publish later this year, but it's unclear who will carry it to the finish line. 

“Dating Matters consumed a lot of my life and it was destroyed for no reason whatsoever,” said Sarah DeGue, senior scientist in the Division of Violence Prevention, who led the CDC's Dating Matters program for the last decade. “American teens are in the midst of a mental health crisis. … This is the absolute worst possible time to eliminate effective programs and resources that teach kids healthy relationship skills.”

DeGue was part of the administration's so-called “reduction in force.” Since leaving the CDC, she has started her own consulting firm focused on violence prevention and is uploading deleted resources to her firm's website. 

The former CDC employee who declined to make their name public said they hope lawmakers can intervene to protect the work. “I believe that there are still people in Congress, in our government at that level who care… But not the Trump administration. I don't believe that at all.” 

In his first term, Trump only floated cuts to the Office on Violence Against Women and didn't follow through. Now, groups are acutely aware of how many people will suffer — and die — without the funding that makes their services possible.

Two prominent lawsuits are challenging the constitutionality of these specific cuts. The American Bar Association won a preliminary injunction in a case alleging its five grants from the Office on Violence Against Women were canceled as retaliation for suing the administration. The $2 million of outstanding grants were to employ seven people to provide training to legal practitioners working with survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. 

FORGE, the only domestic violence services nonprofit dedicated solely to assisting transgender and nonbinary survivors, relies on the federal government for 90 percent of its operating budget. In February, it joined other LGBTQ+ organizations in suing the Trump administration over the constitutionality of the executive order about gender. In April, the Office of Justice Programs canceled FORGE's grants — over $500,000 in total —to produce a toolkit for providers working with trans victims of crime and a project addressing anti-trans hate . 

Arguments in FORGE's case were held on May 22 in a California district court. An order is expected soon. 

The federal funding freeze in January spooked Jane Doe Inc., Sarang-Sieminski said. Worried about conflicting with executive orders, the nonprofit took its website down. But after two days, it put the site back online. 

Reflecting on their core mission of racial equity is what changed the staff's minds, Sarang-Sieminski said. The site still has sections tailored to LGBTQ+ and immigrant survivors and speaks about building a more equitable world. “It's so through and through who we are that we felt like there's nothing that we really could possibly take down that would protect us in any meaningful way,” she said. Taking down the website would “only do further harm to communities who are counting on us to speak up and to be present and available when others refuse to.”

“What keeps me up at night is thinking about the stories we will tell about this time looking back,” Sarang-Sieminski said. “This is liberatory work, and what we want to see is a world where we can all thrive. And to me that means not leaving folks behind and standing up for our fundamental principles around this work.” Half of the organization's funding is dependent on federal grants, but she doesn't want that to “cloud our judgment around our values.”

On Thursday, Democratic Reps. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin and Debbie Dingell of Michigan, and Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, will join a coalition of intimate partner and sexual violence groups for a day of action on Capitol Hill to discuss the importance of federal funding. Both Moore and Dingell have led several letters to the administration pushing back on funding delays and staffing cuts.

“I am horrified,” said Moore, who has detailed her experience as a victim of domestic violence. “Maybe it's not intentional, but it's very dangerous as a survivor of domestic violence — a survivor in the days where there was no crisis line to call, … no information to be able to stand up for yourself. There was no shelter to go to.”

“We've made so much progress in the last decade,” Dingell said. “We're going backwards, and it really scares me.”

The Palestinian town of Umm al-Fahm is on the frontlines of the struggle against Israeli state terror and genocide.

As images of burned children, starving families, and bombed hospitals in Gaza become the constant soundtrack of daily life, the Palestinian communities that survived the Nakba and stayed in the lands that were occupied by Israel in 1948 (hence called “'48 Palestinians”), are filled with anger, frustration, and a sense of hollowness and disempowerment. Against the general paralysis, Umm al-Fahm, the main Palestinian city in “the Northern Triangle region,” stands out.

Palestinian activists in the town, united around the local “popular committee,” keep trying to break the barriers of repression and fear that have taken hold in their community since October 7. The last attempt was on Saturday, May 24.

The popular committee in Umm al-Fahm called for a national demonstration backed by the Higher Follow-Up Committee of the Arab Public — the united leadership of '48 Palestinian communities — alongside the Committee for Solidarity with the Administrative Detainee Raja Eghbarieh. 

The invitation for the demonstration came under three slogans: “We stand with our people! No to ethnic cleansing and genocide! Freedom to the teacher Raja and all other detainees!”

Even as the demonstration was licensed, the police did not let it end peacefully. As we gathered in Dawar al-‘Uyun, plainclothed “detectives” started to attack demonstrators and tear down some banners that they did not like. I noticed specifically that they objected to such banners as “No to Genocide” and “No to Ethnic Cleansing.”

This practice, where the police decide to censor the banners in a demonstration, is typical of the current blatant hostility of the police under the command of extreme right-wing National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. Even as the demonstrators do not initiate any confrontation, the local police want to prove their militancy to their higher command. They claim that some banners “might disturb public order” and attack the people who carry them.

When we wanted to start marching, the police blocked the road. There were some pushes and shoves, and people began circumventing the police. Finally, the police understood that it would not be simple to stop the demonstration, and “remembered” that our march was originally permitted.

One of the conditions of licensing demonstrations these days is that the Palestinian flag cannot be raised. As we were marching, the police noticed that some demonstrators were holding (not raising) the flags. They broke up the crowd violently and tore them from the hands of those holding them. In the chaos that ensued, they violently arrested a demonstrator.

It is no surprise that Umm al-Fahm is where '48 Palestinians most consistently try to organize protests against the genocide in Gaza. Descending from a long history of struggle, Umm al-Fahm is where Abnaa al-Balad, the radical left Palestinian movement, was born in 1969. The city has also been the center and unassailable fortress of the “Northern” Islamic Movement, which Israel outlawed in 2015. Naji al-Ali, the revolutionary Palestinian cartoonist, once wrote that “Umm al-Fahm is the nom de guerre of Palestine.”

In the early 2020s, ‘48 Palestinian communities were subjected to the terror of extortionist criminal gangs groomed by the Israeli internal intelligence service, the Shabak. The people of Umm al-Fahm responded with a rare example of popular mobilization against organized crime and societal violence in the community. New youth initiatives united with old political leaderships to organize mass demonstrations against the police's complicity with the criminal gangs. The same “Fahmawi” unified movement reached new peaks during what we call “Habbat al-Karameh,” or the “uprising of dignity” of May 2021, also called the “Unity Intifada.” The mass protest that started with the struggle against ethnic cleansing in Jerusalem's Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood quickly developed into a unified struggle across all of historic Palestine from the river to the sea.

The first demonstration of '48 Palestinians against the genocide in Gaza was held in Umm al-Fahm on October 19, 2023 — we tried the day before in Haifa, but were immediately repressed. The Umm al-Fahm police used this anti-war demonstration to frame two prominent leaders of the youth movement against criminality, Muhammad Taher Jabareen, and the attorney Ahmad Khalifah. They were arrested, tortured, and indicted for “incitement to terrorism.” Ahmad and Muhammad spent four and eight months in prison, respectively, and now remain under partial house arrest while they await sentencing.

Over the last year and a half, as Israel's war crimes continue to escalate, the Popular Committee of Umm al-Fahm continues to initiate street protests to try to pull the public out of the state of terror, hoping to turn despair into action. Most of these protests take place, almost weekly, in the central circle near the entrance to the city, in front of the new municipality building. Usually, there are dozens of participants from the city and the surrounding villages. 

We have a group of activists in Haifa that keeps trying to demonstrate against the genocide, but we are regularly attacked and dispersed by the police, so we have made a habit of joining the demonstrations in Umm al-Fahm. We meet there with activists from other regions within ‘48, all coming to encourage the most consistent effort at organizing anti-genocide activity by '48 Palestinians. Some of those who regularly join are radical activists from the Jewish society in Palestine, who are used to volunteering as “human shields” in the West Bank, trying to protect Palestinians against attacks by the occupying army and the settlers.

For more than half a year after October 7, it was totally impossible for Palestinians to receive a license for any kind of anti-war demonstration. As time passed, the Umm al-Fahm popular committee succeeded in getting one, and over the last year, the High Follow-Up Committee held several “national marches” in Umm al-Fahm, in which hundreds of demonstrators participated. 

Last January, the Follow-Up Committee wanted to organize a demonstration in Sakhnin, the center of the Galilee, but they could not get a license. 

After Israel broke the ceasefire with Gaza with ever more deadly attacks, the Popular Committee decided to move a step further, calling for the next anti-war demo to be held at the entrance of Umm al-Fahm near Route 65, connecting Tel Aviv with the Eastern Galilee. The street, also known as Wadi ‘Ara road, was shut down by Palestinian demonstrators on many important occasions in the past. While shutting down roads is not uncommon in demonstrations in Israel and is usually “contained” by the police, the possibility that Palestinians would engage in such actions is seen by the regime as a “security threat.”

On April 5, instead of the usual dozens who attend most anti-war demonstrations, hundreds gathered near the main road. The police were surprised, declaring that the gathering was illegal, but they did not have the force to disperse it. The main road was not blocked, but it resulted in a tense standoff. It felt like the spirit of struggle had returned to the streets.

After midnight on April 9, Israeli police and the Shabak forces stormed the house of Raja Eghbarieh, 63, the leader of Abnaa al-Balad in Umm al-Fahm, and the most prominent historical leader of that movement. After a week-long interrogation by the Shabak, and after they could not prove any offence, he was transferred to administrative detention — imprisonment without charge or trial.

At the beginning of the war, hundreds of '48 Palestinians were arrested. Most of them were charged with “incitement to terror” based on social media posts that were sympathetic to the people of Gaza. As “security prisoners,” they were thrown, together with thousands of their fellow prisoners from the West Bank, to the occupation's notorious dungeons. At the instruction of the extreme rightwing government and the anti-Palestinian public hysteria, these prisons became ruthless torture centers in a way that is historically unprecedented. While at the beginning of the war, there were many indictments and few administrative detentions in '48, the Shabak has recently expanded the usage of administrative detention.

For Palestinians from the West Bank, the number of administrative detainees went up from the hundreds to the thousands after October 7. We do not know the real numbers in ‘48 Palestine, as most of the detainees' families are terrorized into silence and fear that any publicity would invite retribution on their loved ones. Yet the number of known cases continues to increase by the dozen. 

The detention of Eghbarieh is considered a significant escalation for ‘48 Palestinians, as it is clearly aimed at the Palestinian political leadership. With his detention, the ghost of administrative detention finally had a name and a face that could be published. This helped to organize the struggle. The demonstrations that followed in Umm al-Fahm were not only against the genocide in Gaza, but also against administrative detention.

The next time that the popular committee called for a demonstration near the Wadi ‘Ara Road on the main entrance to Umm al-Fahm on May 10, the police decided not to let it happen. They threatened the organizers that if they pressed on with the demonstration, every single participant would be arrested. It was clear that this time the police would be there in great force, and the consequences could be severe. The organizers decided to cancel the demonstration at the last minute.

There was another inner circle demonstration on May 17, and then the latest national march on May 24. The confrontation at the May 24 demonstration, which marched as planned despite police provocations and a last-minute attempt to block it, was another step in the consistent efforts to break the silence that has prevented solidarity with Gaza.

Alongside the genocide in Gaza and the increasingly violent attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank, Israel has also intensified its policy of demolishing Arab houses, infrastructure, and commercial buildings inside the “Green Line”. Tens of thousands of homes, all over the country, are under demolition orders. In the Naqab, where there are hundreds of unrecognized Palestinian Bedouin “concentrations,” demolition of Palestinian homes is the main priority of the regime, as the police initiate high publicity campaigns to destroy whole villages.

The “war” atmosphere and the general terrorization of the population has impeded resistance to the demolitions. But on Thursday, May 29, there was an unprecedented general strike of the Palestinian population in the Naqab. On the morning of the general strike, thousands gathered in the regional capital of Bir al-Sabe' for a spirited demonstration in front of the government offices responsible for land confiscation and ethnic cleansing in the region.

On the same night, in the town of Arraba al-Batof at the center of the Galilee, hundreds responded to the call of the local popular committee and gathered to defend the home of one of the residents from a pending demolition. The house was saved, at least for now.

Finally, after a long political and legal struggle, a broad coalition of movements and NGOs, the Communist Party most prominent among them, received a license to march in Haifa against the war for the first time since October 7. The demonstration is set to take place today, May 31, and the organizers expect wide participation.

US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee spoke exclusively to Fox News Digital on the US-Israel relationship, Iran, prospects for a hostage deal, and enlarging the Abraham Accords. (Video: Yoav Dudkevitch/TPS-IL for Fox News Digital.)

EXCLUSIVE - The United States will not participate in a conference next month in New York City hosted by France and Saudi Arabia aimed at promoting the recognition of a Palestinian state, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview in Jerusalem earlier this week.

""It's incredibly inappropriate in the midst of a war that Israel is dealing with to go out and present something that I think increasingly Israelis are steadfast against.

""Oct. 7 changed a lot of things. If France is really so determined to see a Palestinian state, I have a suggestion for them–carve out a piece of the French Riviera and create a Palestinian state. They are welcome to do that, but they are not welcome to impose that kind of pressure on a sovereign nation. And I find it revolting that they think they have the right to do such a thing.

TRUMP'S MIDDLE EAST TRIP HANDED ISRAEL A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY — IF IT CHOOSES TO ACT, EXPERTS SAY

""I hope they will reconsider but the U.S. will not participate. It simply will not be a part of such a ruse,"" he added.

Huckabee, commenting on recently reported tensions between the two close allies, noted there may be disagreements between the Trump administration and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, but there should be no fear of a rupture in bilateral ties.

""I don't think pro-Israel Americans need to be concerned that there's some rift between the United States and Israel. Are there sometimes differences of opinion on the next steps in the war in Gaza, getting the hostages home, or maybe to avoid an all-out war with Iran? Of course, that's natural,"" he said.

""But as far as the relationship between Israel and the U.S., that is not in any way at risk, nor is it in any way splintered or fractured. It's solid, it has to be. We don't have a choice. It's critically important that the United States maintains its partnership—and I use that word very deliberately—it's not a friendship, it's not an alliance, it's a partnership, which means we are yoked together in our intelligence sharing, military — so many ways in which our nations are linked inseparably.""

On talks between Washington and Tehran, the ambassador described the Islamic Republic as ""one of the if not the greatest, threats to world peace,"" warning that it poses a serious and immediate existential threat not only to Israel, but also to several Gulf nations and ultimately to the United States.

""The Iranians have said Israel is the ‘Little Satan,' but America is the ‘Great Satan.' They've always treated Israel as the appetizer and the United States as the entrée,"" he said. ""It's just important when people tell you over and over for 46 years they plan to kill you, you might want to start taking them seriously.""

Nevertheless, Huckabee expressed hope that ongoing nuclear negotiations between the two nations would be successful and avoid any kind of military conflict.

IRAN WARNS ISRAEL AND US 'CAN'T DO A DAMN THING' TO THWART TEHRAN NUCLEAR AMBITIONS AS TENSIONS ESCALATE

""But when diplomacy fails, the soldiers show up,"" he said.

""I find it hard to believe the Iranians, after all these years of pushing towards a nuclear device that is weaponized, would suddenly come to their senses and say we've changed. We don't want that anymore, but let's hope they do. But if they don't, the president has been incredibly clear that Iran is not going to have a nuclear weapon.""

On Israel's ongoing war against Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip, he emphasized that the suffering could end immediately—if Hamas chooses to act.

""All of us are hoping and praying that Hamas will finally give up all the hostages and release them, and then they will depart Gaza for good. If they do these two things, this is over,"" he said. ""It could have been over on Oct. 8, 2023; it should have been. What they did was unthinkable, horrific, heinous, uncivilized, savage behavior.""

He noted that President Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted that Hamas has no future in Gaza. ""They can't rule it, they can't stay,"" said Huckabee.

""Israel has been clear that they are willing to put them on airplanes and fly them out in exile, they have a way out, but they don't have a way in. They have to go, and all hostages living and dead have to be returned,"" he added.

Huckabee expressed hope that this would happen immediately.

Speaking to Fox News Digital on Thursday, he said of the hostages, ""This pin that I wear on my lapel—one of the happiest days of my life will be when I can take this pin off and permanently put it away, never to wear it again, because that means all of the hostages have come home,"" he said.

He also expressed confidence in the prospect of expanding the Abraham Accords, forged during Trump's first term, which normalized relations between Israel and four Arab states: the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco.

While not naming new countries considering joining, Huckabee said, ""There are a number of nations that now realize that having enmity with Israel is meaningless,"" he said. ""It is a delicate path for some countries; they can't go faster than their people are willing to go and accept … but there is a great atmosphere and possibility that we will see some dramatic changes and big additions to the Abraham Accords.""

 'Genius Foods' author Max Lugavere discusses Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., taking on big food on 'The Will Cain Show.'

Blood and urine tests have been found to detect the amount of ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) a person eats, according to new research.

Using machine learning, scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) identified hundreds of metabolites (molecules produced during metabolism) that correlated with processed food intake.

The team developed a ""biomarker score"" that predicts ultraprocessed food intake based on metabolite measurements in blood and urine, according to Erikka Loftfield, Ph.D., M.P.H., of the National Cancer Institute in Maryland.

PREMATURE DEATH LINKED TO CERTAIN TYPE OF FOOD, STUDY REVEALS

The researchers drew baseline data from 718 older adults who provided urine and blood samples and reported their dietary habits over a 12-month period, as detailed in an NIH press release.

Next, they conducted a small clinical trial of 20 adults. For two weeks, the group ate a diet high in ultraprocessed foods, and for another two weeks they ate a diet with no UPFs.

Scientists at the National Institutes of Health have developed the first test to objectively measure ultraprocessed food intake through blood and urine. (iStock)

""In our study, we found that hundreds of serum and urine metabolites were correlated with percentage energy from ultraprocessed food intake,"" Loftfield told Fox News Digital.

The findings were published in the journal PLOS Medicine.

THE WORST FOODS TO BUY IN THE SUPERMARKET AND THE BETTER CHOICES INSTEAD

Large-scale studies investigating the health risks of ultraprocessed foods often rely on self-reported dietary questionnaires, which can be prone to errors, per the NIH.

The new blood and urine test helps to reduce human error by using objective biomarkers, a growing area of interest among researchers.

Using machine learning, the team identified hundreds of metabolites that correlated with processed food intake. (iStock)

Loftfield added, ""It was surprising to find that UPF-correlated metabolites are involved in numerous and diverse biological pathways, underscoring the complex impact of diet on the metabolome.""

Ultraprocessed foods are defined as ""ready-to-eat or ready-to-heat, industrially manufactured products, typically high in calories and low in essential nutrients,"" according to the NIH.

Chronic diseases, obesity and various forms of cancer have been linked to diets that are heavy in UPFs.

Despite promising results, the researchers emphasized that the new method will require further validation before broader use.

Since the current trial focused mainly on older adults, more research is needed across various age groups and diets, the experts said.

""Metabolite scores should be evaluated and improved in populations with different diets and a wide range of UPF intake,"" Loftfield acknowledged.

This method could potentially be used in future research to link the consumption of processed foods with chronic diseases, according to the researchers.

""For individuals concerned about ultraprocessed food intake, one practical recommendation is to use ‘nutrition facts' labels to avoid foods high in added sugars, saturated fat and sodium, as this can limit UPF intake and align with robust scientific research on diet and health,"" Loftfield suggested.

Ukraine suffered another bombardment of aerial attacks from Russia Friday night into Saturday morning as successful talks toward a peace deal to end the war appear far from happening.

There were 114 aerial attacks on Ukraine via drones and missiles overnight, with at least 10 people being killed and 33 others injured due to the Russian attacks, according to ABC News. Russia has continued heavy attacks on Ukrainian cities even as President Donald Trump attempts to broker peace and a ceasefire between the countries.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier this week that “Russian strikes are becoming increasingly brazen and large-scale every night” and has encouraged western allies, like the U.S., to exert more pressure on Russia to agree to a ceasefire and end to the war.

Trump, who was more critical of Ukraine in earlier months this year, has recently become increasingly critical of Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin.

Last weekend, Trump said he would “absolutely” consider sanctions on Russia when talking with reporters and added that he was “not happy” with Putin's continued attacks on Ukrainian cities.

On Tuesday, Trump continued to express his frustration with Russia, saying that Putin was “playing with fire.”

“What Vladimir Putin doesn't realize is that if it weren't for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD. He's playing with fire!” Trump said in a Truth Social post.

RUSSIAN AND US OFFICIALS RATCHET UP RHETORIC AS PROGRESS ON PEACE STALLS

Trump then said in remarks Wednesday that he would give the Russian president two weeks to show he was serious about ending the Russia-Ukraine war or if he was “tapping us along.”

The U.S. president had claimed on the campaign trail last year that he would quickly resolve the conflict that broke out in February 2022, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but getting the two countries to a peace deal has taken significantly longer than he predicted.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The autism commission is doomed to fail.

by  Dylan Scott

Let's start with one unambiguous fact: More children are diagnosed with autism today than in the early 1990s. 

According to a sweeping 2000 analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a range of 2–7 per 1,000, or roughly 0.5 percent of US children, were diagnosed with autism in the 1990s. That figure has risen to 1 in 35 kids, or roughly 3 percent.

The apparent rapid increase caught the attention of people like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who assumed that something had to be changing in the environment to drive it. In 2005, Kennedy, a lawyer and environmental activist at the time, authored an infamous essay in Rolling Stone that primarily placed the blame for the increased prevalence of autism on vaccines. (The article was retracted in 2011 as more studies debunked the vaccine-autism connection.) More recently, he has theorized that a mysterious toxin introduced in the late 1980s must be responsible. 

Now, as the nation's top health official leading the Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has declared autism an “epidemic.” And, in April, he launched a massive federal effort to find the culprit for the rise in autism rates, calling for researchers to examine a range of suspects: chemicals, molds, vaccines, and perhaps even ultrasounds given to pregnant mothers. 

“Genes don't cause epidemics. You need an environmental toxin,” Kennedy said in April when announcing his department's new autism research project. He argued that too much money had been put into genetic research — “a dead end,” in his words — and his project would be a correction to focus on environmental causes. “That's where we're going to find an answer.”

But according to many autism scientists I spoke to for this story, Kennedy is looking in exactly the wrong place. 

Autism is a complex disorder with a range of manifestations that has long defied simple explanations, and it's unlikely that we will ever identify a single “cause” of autism.

But scientists have learned a lot in the past 50 years, including identifying some of the most important risk factors. They are not, as Kennedy suggests, out in our environment. They are written into our genetics. What appeared to be a massive increase in autism was actually a byproduct of better screening and more awareness. 

“The way the HHS secretary has been walking about his plans, his goals, he starts out with this basic assumption that nothing worthwhile has been done,” Helen Tager-Flusberg, a psychologist at Boston University who has worked with and studied children with autism for years, said. “Genes play a significant role. We know now that autism runs in families… There is no single underlying factor. Looking for that holy grail is not the best approach.”

Doctors who treat children with autism often talk about how they wish they could provide easy answers to the families. The answers being uncovered through genetics research may not be simple per se, but they are answers supported by science.

Kennedy is muddying the story, pledging to find a silver-bullet answer where likely none exists. It's a false promise — one that could cause more anxiety and confusion for the very families Kennedy says he wants to help. 

Autism was first described in 1911, and for many decades, researchers and clinicians confused the social challenges and language development difficulties common among those with the condition for a psychological issue. Some child therapists even blamed the condition on bad parenting. 

But in 1977, a study discovered that identical twins, who share all of their DNA, were much more likely to both be autistic than fraternal twins, who share no more DNA than ordinary siblings. It marked a major breakthrough in autism research, and pushed scientists to begin coalescing around a different theory: There was a biological factor.

At the time, this was just a theory — scientists lacked the technology to prove those suspicions at the genetic level. And clinicians were also still trying to work out an even more fundamental question: What exactly was autism? 

For a long time, the criteria for diagnosing a person with autism was strictly based on speech development. But clinicians were increasingly observing children who could acquire basic language skills but still struggled with social communication — things like misunderstanding nonverbal cues or taking figurative language literally. Psychologists gradually broadened their definition of autism from a strict and narrow focus on language, culminating in a 2013 criteria that included a wide range of social and emotional symptoms with three subtypes — the autism spectrum disorder we're familiar with today.

Along the way, autism had evolved from a niche diagnosis for the severely impaired to something that encompassed far more children. 

It makes sense then, that as the broad criteria for autism expanded, more and more children would meet it, and autism rates would rise. That's precisely what happened. And it means that the “epidemic” that Kennedy and other activists have been fixated on is mostly a diagnostic mirage. 

Historical autism data is spotty and subject to these same historical biases, but if you look at the prevalence of profound autism alone — those who need the highest levels of support — a clearer picture emerges. (There is an ongoing debate in the autism community about whether to use the terminology of “profound autism” or “high support needs” for those who have the most severe form of the condition.) In the '80s and '90s, low-support needs individuals would have been less likely to receive an autism diagnosis given the more restrictive criteria and less overall awareness of the disorder, meaning that people with severe autism likely represented most of the roughly 0.5 percent of children diagnosed with autism in the 1990s. (One large analysis from Atlanta examining data from 1996 found that 68 percent of kids ages 3 to 10 diagnosed with autism had an IQ below 70, the typical cutoff for intellectual disability.)

By 2025, when about 3 percent of children are being diagnosed with autism, about one in four of those diagnosed are considered to have high-support needs autism, those with most severe manifestation of the condition. That would equal about 0.8 percent of all US children — which would be a fairly marginal increase from autism rates 30 years ago. Or look at it another way: In 2000, as many as 60 percent of the people being diagnosed with autism had an intellectual disability, one of the best indicators of high-support needs autism. In 2022, that percentage was less than 40 percent.

As a recently published CDC report on autism prevalence among young children concluded, the increase in autism rates can largely be accounted for by stronger surveillance and more awareness among providers and parents, rather than a novel toxin or some other external factor driving an increase in cases.

Other known risk factors — like more people now having babies later in their life, given that parental age is linked to a higher likelihood of autism — are more likely to be a factor than anything Kennedy is pointing at, experts say. 

“It's very clear it's not going to be one environmental toxin,” said Alison Singer, founder of the Autism Science Foundation and parent of a child with profound autism. “If there were a smoking gun, I think they would have found it.”

While Kennedy has fixated on vaccines and environmental influences, scientists have gained more precision in mapping human genetics and identifying the biological mechanisms that appear to be a primary cause of autism. And that not only helps us understand why autism develops, but potentially puts long-elusive therapies within reach. 

It began with an accident in the 1990s. 

Stephen Scherer, now director of the Center for Applied Genomics at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, began his career in the late 1980s trying to identify the gene that caused cystic fibrosis — in collaboration with Francis Collins, who went on to lead the Human Genome Project that successfully sequenced all of the DNA in the human genome in the early 2000s. Scherer and Collins's teams focused on chromosome 7, identified as a likely target by the primitive genetic research available at the time, a coincidence that would reorient Scherer's career just a few years later, putting him on the trail of autism's genetic roots.

After four years, the researchers concluded that one gene within chromosome 7 caused cystic fibrosis. Soon after Scherer helped crack the code on cystic fibrosis, in the mid-1990s, two parents from California called him: He was the world's leading expert on chromosome 7, and recent tests had revealed that their children with autism had a problem within that particular chromosome.

That very same week, Scherer says, he read the findings of a study by a group at Oxford University, which had looked at the chromosomes of families with two or more kids with autism. They, too, had identified problems within chromosome 7.

“So I said, ‘Okay, we're going to work on autism,'” Scherer told me. He helped coordinate a global research project, uniting his Canadian lab with the Oxford team and groups in the US to run a database that became the Autism Genome Project, still the world's largest repository of genetic information of people with autism.

They had a starting point — one chromosome — but a given chromosome contains hundreds of genes. And humans have, of course, 45 other chromosomes, any of which conceivably might play a role. So over the years, they collected DNA samples from thousands upon thousands of people with autism, sequenced their genes, and then searched for patterns. If the same gene is mutated or missing across a high percentage of autistic people, it goes on the list as potentially associated with the condition. 

Scientists discovered that autism has not one genetic factor, but many — further evidence that this is a condition of complex origin, in which multiple variables likely play a role in its development, rather than one caused by a single genetic error like sickle-cell anemia.

Here is one way to think about how far we have come: Joseph Buxbaum, the director of the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, entered autism genetics research 35 years ago. He recalls scientists being hopeful that they might identify a half dozen or so genes linked to autism.

They have now found 500 genes — and Buxbaum told me he believed they might find a thousand before they are through. These genetic factors continue to prove their value in predicting the onset of autism: Scherer pointed to one recent study in which the researchers identified people who all shared a mutation in the SHANK3 gene, one of the first to be associated with autism, but who were otherwise unalike: They were not related and came from different demographic backgrounds. Nevertheless, they had all been diagnosed with autism.

Precisely how much genetics contributes to the development of autism remains the subject of ongoing study. By analyzing millions of children with autism and their parents for patterns in diagnoses, multiple studies have attributed about 80 percent of a person's risk of developing autism to their inherited genetic factors. 

But of course 80 percent is not 100 percent. We don't yet have the full picture of how or why autism develops. Among identical twins, for example, studies have found that in most cases, if one twin has high-support needs autism, the other does as well, affirming the genetic effect. But there are consistently a small minority of cases — 5 and 10 percent of twin pairs, Scherer told me — in which one twin has relatively low-support needs while the one requires a a high degree of support for their autism.

Kennedy is not wholly incorrect to look at environmental factors — researchers theorize that autism may be the result of a complex interaction between a person's genetics and something they experience in utero. 

Scientists in autism research are exploring the possible influence when, for example, a person's mother develops maternal diabetes, high blood sugar that persists throughout pregnancy. And yet even if these other factors do play some role, the researchers I spoke to agree that genetics is, based on what we know now, far and away the most important driver.

“We need to figure out how other types of genetics and also environmental factors affect autism's development,” Scherer said. “There could be environmental changes…involved in some people, but it's going to be based on their genetics and the pathways that lead them to be susceptible.”

While the precise contours of Health Department's new autism research project is still taking shape, Kennedy has that researchers at the National Institutes of Health will collect data from federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and somehow use that information to identify possible environmental exposures that lead to autism. He initially pledged results by September, a timeline that, as outside experts pointed out, may be too fast to allow for a thorough and thoughtful review of the research literature. Kennedy has since backed off on that deadline, promising some initial findings in the fall but with more to come next year.

If Kennedy were serious about moving autism science forward, he would be talking more about genetics, not dismissing them. That's because genetics is where all of the exciting drug development is currently happening.

A biotech firm called Jaguar Gene Therapy has received FDA approval to conduct the first clinical trial of a gene therapy for autism, focused on SHANK3. The treatment, developed in part by one of Buxbaum's colleagues, is a one-time injection that would replace a mutated or missing SHANK3 gene with a functional one. The hope is that the therapy would improve speech and other symptoms among people with high-needs autism who have also been diagnosed with a rare chromosomal deletion disorder called Phelan-McDermid syndrome; many people with this condition also have Autism spectrum disorder.

The trial will begin this year with a few infant patients, 2 years old and younger, who have been diagnosed with autism. Jaguar eventually aims to test the therapy on adults over 18 with autism in the future. Patients are supposed to start enrolling this year in the trial, which is focused on first establishing the treatment's safety; if it proves safe, another round of trials would start to rigorously evaluate its effectiveness.

“This is the stuff that three or four years ago sounded like science fiction,” Singer said. “The conversation has really changed from Is this possible? to What are the best methods to do it? And that's based on genetics.”

Researchers at Mount Sinai have also experimented with delivering lithium to patients and seeing if it improves their SHANK3 function. Other gene therapies targeting other genes are in earlier stages of development. Some investigators are experimenting with CRISPR technology, the revolutionary new platform for gene editing, to target the problematic genes that correspond to the onset of autism.

But these scientists fear that their work could be slowed by Kennedy's insistence on hunting for environmental toxins, if federal dollars are instead shifted into his new project. They are already trying to subsist amid deep budget cuts across the many funding streams that support the institutions where they work. 

“Now we have this massive disruption where instead of doing really key experiments, people are worrying about paying their bills and laying off their staff and things,” Scherer said. “It's horrible.” 

For the families of people with high-needs autism, Kennedy's crusade has stirred conflicting emotions. Alison Singer, the leader of the Autism Science Foundation, is also the parent of a child with profound autism. When I spoke with her, I was struck by the bind that Kennedy's rhetoric has put people like her and her family in. 

Singer told me profound autism has not received enough federal support in the past, as more emphasis was placed on individuals who have low support needs included in the expanding definitions of the disorder, and so she appreciates Kennedy giving voice to those families. She believes that he is sincerely empathetic toward their predicament and their feeling that the mainstream discussion about autism has for too long ignored their experiences in favor of patients with lower support needs. But she worries that his obsession with environmental factors will stymie the research that could yield breakthroughs for people like her child.

“He feels for those families and genuinely wants to help them,” Singer said. “The problem is he is a data denier. You can't be so entrenched in your beliefs that you can't see the data right in front of you. That's not science.”

For the first several months of President Donald Trump's second term, DOGE seemed like an unstoppable force. Now, political gravity is about to kick in.

Though he says he'll still be in Washington here and there, Elon Musk is ending his time as an official White House employee. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is preparing to formally ask Congress to begin codifying some of the cuts DOGE has already made — a process that's far from certain to succeed.

It all amounts to a new phase for DOGE, one where the swift and disruptive action of Trump's first few months will give way to the delays, gridlock, and possibility of failure that come with trying to pass bills through Congress.

""The DOGE team has done incredible work,"" Musk said during a recent appearance at the Qatar Economic Forum. ""But the magnitude of the savings is proportionate to the support we get from Congress and from the executive branch of the government in general.""

The first task for Republicans is passing $9.4 billion in cuts that the White House plans to send to Congress on Tuesday. That so-called ""rescission"" package, which rescinds funding previously approved by the legislative branch, includes $8.3 billion in cuts to foreign aid and $1.1 billion in cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the government-backed entity that funds NPR and PBS.

Symbolically, it's a big deal. Republicans have been clamoring to cut federal funding to NPR and PBS for months, and the House DOGE subcommittee held a hearing on the issue in March. There's also been growing frustration on the right that DOGE cuts haven't come sooner, with some lawmakers arguing that they should be regularly voting to codify spending cuts.

""We should have been voting on DOGE cuts every single week,"" Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia wrote on X on Monday.

Numerically, however, the $9.4 billion package is minuscule. It's less than half of one percent of the $2 trillion that Musk once envisioned cutting, and it's only about 6% of the $160 billion that Musk says DOGE has cut already.

And despite GOP control of both the House and the Senate, it's not guaranteed to pass. All it would take is a handful of Republicans to derail the effort, and when Trump tried to pass a $15 billion recession package in his first term, it failed in the Senate.

There's already at least one GOP senator who's likely to vote against it: Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who recently wrote an op-ed opposing cuts to public broadcasting funding.

A White House official told BI that the $9.4 billion in cuts — only the second time a president has sent a rescission package to Congress since 2000 — is an indication of the administration's commitment to following through on DOGE's work. The official also expressed optimism that the package would pass and that more rescissions would come in the future.

While there may be more rescissions down the line, much of the DOGE cuts are likely to be made in the coming government funding process, which Congress will have to wrap up before funding runs out at the end of September.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said as much in a post on X on Wednesday, adding that the House is ""eager and ready to act on DOGE's findings so we can deliver even more cuts to big government.""

That will be even harder than passing stand-alone DOGE cuts. While rescission packages only require a simple majority in both chambers to pass, government funding is generally a bipartisan process — one that Democrats have the power to block entirely in the Senate via the 60-vote filibuster rule.

Democrats let a government funding bill pass the Senate in March despite their misgivings about DOGE at the time. That led to intense backlash from the Democratic base, which has helped fuel primary challenges and calls for generational change. It's unclear that enough Democrats will be willing to do the same thing again in September.

Meanwhile, Republicans are making their own job harder with their ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" a sprawling piece of legislation that, in its current form, would increase the deficit by trillions of dollars over the next decade.

Musk made his dissatisfaction with that bill clear in a recent interview, saying it ""undermines"" the work that DOGE has been doing by increasing the deficit and debt.

""I think a bill can be big, or it could be beautiful,"" Musk said. 'I don't know if it could be both.""

Lyft (LYFT) is a multimodal transportation network in the United States and Canada. It offers access to a variety of transportation options through its platform and mobile-based applications. The Lyft Platform provides a marketplace where drivers can be matched with riders via the Lyft App, where it operates as a transportation network company. Transportation options through its platform and mobile-based applications are substantially comprised of its ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders in cities across the United States and in certain cities in Canada, Lyft's network of bikes and scooters, and the Express Drive program, where drivers can enter into short-term rental agreements with its subsidiary, Flexdrive Services, LLC or a third party for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft Platform. It makes the ridesharing marketplace available to organizations through Lyft Business offerings, such as the Concierge and Lyft Pass programs.

Activist Commentary: Engine Capital is an experienced activist investor led by Managing Partner Arnaud Ajdler, former partner and senior managing director at Crescendo Partners. Engine's history is to send letters and/or nominate directors but settle rather quickly.

On March 25, Engine announced a position in Lyft and stated that they are calling for a strategic review, improved capital allocations and the elimination of the company's dual-class share structure. On April 16, Engine nominated two directors for election to the Board at the 2025 annual meeting, but ultimately withdrew those nominations following productive engagement with the company that led to several capital allocation initiatives, including the company committing to significant share repurchases in the coming quarters.

Since David Risher took control as CEO of Lyft in 2023, Lyft has made some major improvements, streamlining operations, enhancing platform functionality, and expanding market presence. These have led to notable material enhancements in the company's operational and financial performance. From 2023 to 2024, revenue increased by 31.39%, EBITDA went from a negative$359.1 million to $27.3 million and free cash flow (FCF) increased from negative $248.06 million to $766.27 million, the latter two of which are in the green for the first time since its IPO. Despite these improvements, Lyft's share price decreased by 30% over the same period.

There are a few factors that may help explain the company's current undervaluation. First is the industry's dynamics as Lyft operates in a duopoly with Uber in the rideshare market. In the US, Uber holds approximately 75% percent of the market while Lyft holds 24% with the rest controlled by niche areas (i.e. Curb, Alto, and Waymo). The company is in an inherently difficult strategic position due to Uber's dominance — while Lyft is only in the US and Canada, Uber is diversified across most global markets and has expanded into other synergetic areas like food and alcohol delivery. This makes Lyft particularly vulnerable to Uber's decisions regarding pricing and promotions, as management noted during the company's most recent earnings call. The market has sensed this situation, with Lyft's shares underperforming compared to Uber by 37%, 287%, and 210% over the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, respectively. Second to this is Lyft's suboptimal capital allocation practices. The company has experienced excessive share dilution. Since 2019, Lyft's shares outstanding have almost doubled. Currently, dilution is primarily caused by the company's stock-based compensation (SBC) practices, which are currently around $330 million annually, 4.9% of Lyft's market cap.

Enter Engine, who is calling for a strategic review, improved capital allocation practices and the elimination of the company's dual-class share structure. These proposals are all worth evaluating. First, there are a few reasons why a strategic review, specifically a potential strategic acquisition, makes sense. As has been already discussed, one of, if not the largest challenge Lyft faces is their inability to scale and diversify at the pace of Uber. As the rideshare industry continues to grow and evolve, this will only become increasingly important to Lyft's potential long-term success. It seems like the most effective way to overcome this is to be either sold to or merged with a larger strategic entity that can give Lyft the scale and diversification it needs to compete with Uber.  Large players in the food delivery or automotive industry make sense as potential acquirers. For example, Doordash, with a roughly $80 billion market cap, could easily afford Lyft, has synergies to better optimize both platforms, a global presence, and would create more revenue stream options for drivers. On the other hand, automative companies testing the rideshare autonomous vehicle industry like Google (Waymo) and Amazon (Zoox), which is potentially the next technological evolution in the rideshare space, also make sense as acquirers. Given Lyft's depressed valuation (EV to 2026 consensus EBITDA multiple of approximately 6.6x), recent growth, and large number of potential synergies, a large takeout premium is certainly possible here.

Secondly, the company clearly needs to improve its capital allocation practices. While Lyft recently announced a $500 million buyback program, this is not even sufficient to counter the dilution over the next two years due to current SBC practices. With $2 billion of cash (approximately $700 million of net cash) and the company dramatically increasing their FCF, it appears that Lyft has the ability to much more aggressively repurchase shares to do more than just counter SBC dilution.

Lastly, as a corporate governance investor, Engine will propose eliminating the dual-class structure. Originally set up to give control to the founders, this structure now seems unnecessary since co-founders John Zimmer and Logan Green are no longer involved in day-to-day operations. These preferred shares carry 20 votes per share, which give them 30.8% of the total voting power while owning only approximately 2.3% of outstanding shares. Eliminating the dual-class share structure makes complete sense, is the right thing to do and would be supported by the vast majority of shareholders. However, there is virtually no way that Zimmer and Green will voluntarily give up this control position. As an experienced activist investor Ajdler knows that, but also as an experienced activist investor, he has to try. But at the very least, the Company can refine the board to reflect the changes over the past six years since its IPO – seven of the ten current directors have no public company experience other than Lyft - the Board has a lean towards directors with experience in startup companies or early-stage investments. While this background may have once been valuable, that is not where Lyft is as a Company anymore. A refreshment of these directors for people with public market, capital allocation and capital markets expertise, would better position the Company for what it is today.

After launching a proxy fight for two board seats, this campaign came to a head when Engine withdrew their director nominations on May 8. This withdrawal came following the company's public announcement to increase its share repurchase authorization to $750 million and commit to utilize $200 million of such authorization over the next three months and $500 million within the next 12 months.

Tracee Ellis Ross, actress and daughter of music icon Diana Ross, is known for her bubbly personality, and seems to keep an optimistic attitude while juggling her responsibilities.

""I feel like my natural state is joyful, and yet I work at it,"" Ross, 52, said during the New York Times Well Festival earlier this month.

""I think joy is different from happiness. I feel like happiness is something you can get at 7/11, and joy is something that you earn and work for and takes practice.""

Prioritizing joyfulness daily is a choice that requires intention, she said. Small moments like making up catchy tunes when she's feeling overwhelmed are what helps her to shift back into a positive state.

""I have a group of friends that I have a gratitude and fear list that we write together every morning,"" she said.

""To acknowledge and name and put words to the things that actually light up your soul and your heart. I think they allow a balance and a perspective.""

Sharing both what she's grateful for and what she's nervous about with her close friends allows Ross to accept that life is a mixed bag of good moments and not-so-great ones.

""But if you can mix them in with the right kind of perspective and focus on the stuff that is working, I find that I can have a space of joy in my life,"" she said.

Ross shared an example on how she shifted her perspective when faced with a challenge. The night before the festival she couldn't sleep well and was only able to rest for four and a half hours, despite the eventful day she had planned.

""Instead of saying I feel overwhelmed, I use the word, 'My plate is wonderfully full,'"" she said.

On her ride through New York City before arriving at the festival, Ross wrote on her gratitude list that she was grateful for a bright blue sky, career abundance and ""spring New York energy.""

""I think joy is an attitude. I think joy is a perspective, and I think joy is a lens through which I live and look at my life,"" Ross said.

Strategy CEO Michael Saylor touted Bitcoin as a virtually foolproof path to wealth creation for “everyone”—from business owners to families, and even one's enemies—in his speech at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas this week.

During the roughly 35-minute presentation on Thursday entitled “21 Ways to Wealth,” the famous Bitcoin maxi said the world's oldest cryptocurrency is “perfected capital,"" championing its “incorruptible… [and] programmable” nature. He urged his audience to buy Bitcoin to enrich themselves. 

“Bitcoin is engineered to outperform everything,” Saylor proclaimed.

Of course, juicing demand for Bitcoin would likely benefit Saylor and Strategy and boost the value of the company's holdings. The firm added billions of dollars in Bitcoin to its corporate treasury this month, bringing its total holdings to 580,250 BTC—worth more than $60 billion as of the time of writing, according to data provider CoinGecko.

Although speaking before Bitcoiners, the executive stressed that his sales pitch was largely for crypto-curious listeners watching via livestream at home, stressing that Bitcoin is “not [just] for multi-billion-dollar companies.”

“It's for everyone,” Saylor claimed. ""Take your fiat currency, trade it for Bitcoin. Take your long-term capital, trade it for bitcoin. Sell your bonds, trade [them] for Bitcoin. Sell your inferior equity, sell your inferior real estate property, buy Bitcoin.""

The Strategy executive also urged his listeners to embrace AI tools, touting their ability to transform the average person into “100 super-geniuses.”

“I tell all my executives, before you ask a lawyer, before you ask a banker, before you ask any expert, go to the AI,” Saylor said. “Make it think. Grind the silicon overlord.”

Saylor recently shared that Strategy used AI to help craft its unique stock offerings to help power the firm's bountiful Bitcoin buys.

Its Bitcoin acquisition spree has inspired a growing number of firms to stockpile the token, with public companies like Metaplanet, Semler Scientific, and most recently GameStop allocating massive amounts of capital to increase their Bitcoin holdings over the past few months. 

Similarly, institutional investors are also increasingly investing in Bitcoin via exchange-traded funds, pouring billions of dollars into spot Bitcoin ETFs over the past year and a half since their debut in the U.S. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF recorded nearly $6 billion worth of inflows in May once all was said and done, coming close to the monthly record, Farside Investors data shows. 

Investors' growing appetite for Bitcoin has pushed the token's price to new all-time highs. The asset surpassed $109,000 on May 21 before cresting to nearly $112,000 a day later, although its price has since moderated, sitting just above $104,000 as of this writing.

Saylor's speech seemed largely geared towards ensuring Bitcoin would continue its climb to new record highs, bolstered by investments from individuals and institutions across the world. 

The Strategy founder rounded out his speech by eschewing loftier ideas such as “changing the world” or chasing one's passions as “dilutive distractions,” advising his disciples to narrow their focus to buying Bitcoin if they wanted to get rich. Saylor acknowledged the work of pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto in his advice.

“Satoshi gave you an idea worth half of everything on Earth,” Saylor said. “You don't have to topple any particular system that exists in this world… don't fight lost causes.”

On-chain data agency Sentora (formerly known as IntoTheBlock) has published an article analyzing potential threats that Michael Saylor's company, Strategy, may run into as it continues accumulating large amounts of Bitcoin regularly.

Earlier this week, Bitcoin permabull, Michael Saylor, announced that his company Strategy made a substantial addition to its $40 billion BTC stash. That purchase took place as Bitcoin traded at the $106,237 level. Strategy bought 4,020 Bitcoins for roughly $427.1 million. This buy has propelled the overall Bitcoin holdings of the company to 580,250 coins valued approximately at $61.41 billion.

Is Strategy's Bitcoin accumulation approach genius or a gamble?We dive into this in our latest newsletter👇https://t.co/vMeVlsSAgp

This comes in line with the nearly-weekly-purchases pattern followed by Strategy this year. In the middle of May, it bought 7,390 Bitcoins for $764.9 million and 13,390 Bitcoins for a staggering $1.34 billion earlier this month as well. To fund those purchases, the company has been issuing convertible notes and other stocks — MSTR, STRK and STRF. Since Strategy began buying Bitcoin in August 2020, the MSTR price has surged by roughly 2,930%, and it has outperformed Bitcoin by 63% over the past few months.

However, Sentora's analysts believe that the company's strategy of holding and accumulating the world's largest cryptocurrency may face significant hurdles.

ByYuri Molchan





The report published by Sentora shares several key risk factors Strategy may face in the medium to long term.

The first one mentioned is Bitcoin's price volatility — a sharp drop in the BTC price could lead to substantial losses, the report says. Although, it does not seem to stop Saylor — Strategy has made several Bitcoin acquisitions, taking advantage of big price dips.

The second one is the concentrated asset risk. The company now owns 2.76% of the overall Bitcoin supply, and this exposes Strategy to a significant concentrated risk, the authors of the report believe, since the company's stock price is closely correlated to Bitcoin (0.8), meaning that a BTC price downturn would cause losses to MSTR.

The debt-financed purchase strategy of the company may lead to liquidity issues or bankruptcy, the report states, should Bitcoin crash or interest rates rise. Such potential issues as shareholder dilution, liquidity challenges and market impact risk were also mentioned in the report.

Ethereum is on the spotlight again this week. SharpLink Gaming, a US-based sports betting firm, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer up to $1 billion in common stock.

The company says it plans to use the money to purchase Ether (ETH), the main cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. This big move comes just days after SharpLink announced its new Ethereum-based treasury strategy.

Their stock price exploded by nearly 400% during trading on May 27, just after the plan went public. At the same time, the company appointed Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as the new chairman of its board of directors.

According to the May 30 SEC filing, SharpLink wants to put most of the raised funds toward buying Ether. But it's not just about crypto. Some of the cash will also go toward running the business—things like working capital, corporate expenses, and affiliate marketing operations.

ETH was trading at $2,520 at the time of the filing, down 2.31% in 24 hours, based on Coingecko data. The timing of the purchase, and how much Ether they actually buy, could depend on the market. But the message is clear: SharpLink is going all in on Ethereum.

The company also listed several risks that could affect its big Ether investment. One of them is the possible rise of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). If CBDCs take off, SharpLink believes demand for private cryptocurrencies like ETH could drop or lose their usefulness.



Another risk is regulatory. If the SEC or another agency decides to classify Ether as a “security,” SharpLink could face new rules and reporting requirements. That could complicate their plans and cost the company money in the long run.

The crypto community didn't stay quiet. Many compared SharpLink's move to what Strategy did with Bitcoin.

Crypto analyst 0xBoboShanti posted on X (formerly Twitter), “Ethereum finally has its own Saylor,” referring to Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). His firm now owns over 580,250 BTC, valued at more than $60 billion, based on Saylor Tracker.

Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano added to the noise, saying, “You are not bullish enough,” signaling strong support for SharpLink's strategy.

The timing could be key. Just before SharpLink's filing, ETF provider REX Shares submitted paperwork that has analysts predicting Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs could launch in the US soon.

These ETFs would allow investors to earn staking rewards through regulated funds, something many providers have struggled to pull off.

Crypto World News

June 1, 2025 by Paul Adedoyin 

In the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency, the Ethereum ecosystem is making waves, leading the market with impressive gains. A recent post by Merlin The Trader on X highlights that this ecosystem has seen a 46% increase in value over the past month and a 42% rise since the start of the month.

This strong performance has outpaced other major crypto sectors like Bitcoin, decentralized finance (DeFi), artificial intelligence (AI) tokens, and meme coins, showing that the Ether market is currently the top player in the space.

The data shared in the post comes with a detailed table that breaks down how different crypto sectors are doing. Bitcoin, often seen as the leader of the crypto market, has a fully diluted market cap of over $2.2 trillion but only grew by 11.7% this month.

Ethereum, with a market cap of around $316 billion, far exceeded that with its 46% monthly gain. The smart contract platform sector, which includes Ethereum, grew by just 8.1%, while meme coins and DeFi tokens saw gains of 8.2% and 13.5%, respectively.

AI tokens, another popular category, rose by 14%, but that's still well behind Ether's performance.

Source: X (@MerlijnTrader)

Merlin The Trader's post suggests that while many investors might be overlooking Ethereum, smart money (experienced or institutional investors) is rotating into this ecosystem.

This could be due to Ethereum's role as a foundation for many decentralized applications, like those in DeFi or gaming, which rely on its blockchain for secure and transparent transactions. The blockchain's ability to support smart contracts makes it a go-to platform for developers building new projects.

This ecosystem's recent surge highlights that it's not just Bitcoin that can drive the market, other ecosystems can take the lead too. However, the table also shows that crypto can be a rollercoaster, with many sectors experiencing losses over the year.

For example, Ethereum itself is down 21.8% since the start of the year, and DeFi tokens have dropped 44.2% over the same period.

Brazilian fintech Méliuz (CASH3), which serves over 30 million users in the country, is launching a public share offering to raise up to R$450 million ($78 million), with plans to allocate all proceeds to purchasing bitcoin BTC$104,789.61.

The offering, announced Friday in a securities filing, consists of an initial issuance of 17 million common shares, with the possibility of expanding to 51 million depending on demand. Shares will be sold exclusively to professional investors in Brazil and abroad under automatic registration rules.

Each share purchased will come with a package of free subscription warrants divided into 10 series, allowing investors to buy additional stock at set prices in the future.

At current share prices, Méliuz expects to raise around $26 million, but that figure could triple if overallotment options are exercised.

Investors participating in the offering will also receive 50.6 million warrants, of which up to 152 million will be issued in total under maximum subscription conditions.

Méliuz will use the raised funds to acquire BTC, positioning it as a ""primary strategic asset"" in its treasury. The firm, known for its cashback and financial services platform, revealed it was allocating 10% of its cash reserves to BTC back in March.

Warrant trading is expected to begin on June 16, with share settlement and crediting of the bonus instruments by June 18. 

The company currently holds 320.2 BTC. Its shares dropped more than 8% in Friday's trading session.

 US government argues Coinbase user James Harper has no right to block IRS access to his crypto records in Supreme Court filing. 

The US government has urged the Supreme Court not to take up a Coinbase user's challenge against the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) effort to obtain his crypto transaction records.

In a filing dated May 30, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that Coinbase user James Harper has no Fourth Amendment right to shield his financial records held by the exchange.

The government claimed that Harper “voluntarily” shared his data with Coinbase, and that the IRS followed proper legal procedures to obtain it through a judicially approved summons.

Harper's case centers on a 2016 IRS investigation into widespread tax underreporting on cryptocurrency gains. At the time, the IRS discovered a sharp gap between the millions of Coinbase users trading Bitcoin (BTC) and the relatively few taxpayers who reported crypto gains.

In response, the agency obtained a so-called “John Doe” summons compelling Coinbase to turn over records on high-volume customers.

Harper, who traded Bitcoin on Coinbase during the relevant years, later sued, claiming that the IRS's actions amounted to an unconstitutional search of his personal records.

Lower courts disagreed, ruling that Coinbase's records are business documents — not Harper's private papers — and that the IRS acted lawfully.

In its brief, the government argued that Supreme Court precedent supports the IRS's position. Citing past cases such as United States v. Miller, the government emphasized that individuals have no reasonable expectation of privacy in financial records held by third parties Coinbase.

The filing also pointed to Coinbase's own privacy policy, which warned users that information could be shared with law enforcement.

“To the extent petitioner made those arguments below, the court of appeals correctly rejected them as both foreclosed by this Court's precedent and meritless,” the government said.

The Supreme Court has not yet decided whether it will hear the case. A denial would leave in place the First Circuit's ruling in favor of the IRS.

On May 15, Coinbase disclosed a data breach in which attackers bribed customer support staff in India to access sensitive user information.

Stolen data included customer names, account balances, and transaction histories. Coinbase confirmed the breach impacted roughly 1% of its monthly transacting users. Among those affected was venture capitalist Roelof Botha, managing partner at Sequoia Capital.

Coinbase also faced a wave of lawsuits following the revelation. At least six legal complaints were filed on May 15 and 16, with plaintiffs accusing the exchange of failing to implement adequate security measures and mishandling its response to the breach.

$83 billion has just been sitting there underground this whole time.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A deposit of gold ore recently discovered in China isn't just giant. It's supergiant. So much so, in fact, that Chinese experts claim it could be the largest deposit of any precious metal—not just gold ore—in existence today. 

How big is the “supergiant” deposit located under the Wangu gold field in the Hunan province? Experts estimate it at 1,100 tons. 

According to Chinese state media, a team of geologists detected over 40 gold veins of roughly 330 tons of gold ore dipping 6,600 feet deep under Pingjiang County's Wangu gold field. But 3D modeling blows that number out of the water, showing there could be as much as 1,100 tons as deep as 9,800 feet. If the models are accurate, the deposit in its entirely could be worth roughly $83 billion. 

Adding some more heft to the already weighty (literally) find was the report that the new discovery features 138 grams of gold per metric ton of ore, a valuable rate not often found in gold mining. “Many drilled rock cores showed visible gold,” said Chen Rulin, an ore-prospecting expert at China's Hunan Province's Geological Bureau, according to Chinese state media. 

If the 1,100-ton figure holds up, that makes this new find the largest gold mine in the world, even outpacing South Africa's South Deep gold mine with its 1,025 tons of gold, according to Mining Technology. Mines in Indonesia, Russia, New Guinea, and Chile round out the top-five gold mines in the world. The Carlin Trend and Cortez gold mines, both in Nevada, are ranked sixth and 10th worldwide. 

Historically, the world has mined 233,000 tons of gold, all of it still around in some form, and two-thirds of that mining has occurred since 1950. 

Already the world's top gold producer with about 10 percent of global production, China is heavily dependent on the metal, using about three times more gold than it mines annually. A rate that high requires the country to purchase so much gold from other countries that it's also the world's top importer of the valuable metal. This new discovery has put the world's gold markets on notice, enough so that the price of gold rose to $2,700 per ounce, according to CCN.com. 

And the gold news may not stop there. According to Liu Yongjun, vice head of the bureau, additional gold ore was found when drilling around the site's peripheral areas.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Common gene variant doubles dementia risk for men","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250530124112.htm","Sat, 31 May 2025 01:30:31 GMT","

New research has found that men who carry a common genetic variant are twice as likely to develop dementia in their lifetime compared to women.

The research, published in Neurology, used data from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial to investigate whether people who had variants in the haemochromatosis (HFE) gene, which is critical for regulating iron levels in the body, might be at increased risk of dementia.

Co-author Professor John Olynyk, from the Curtin Medical School, said one in three people carry one copy of the variant, known as H63D, while one in 36 carry two copies.

""Having just one copy of this gene variant does not impact someone's health or increase their risk of dementia. However, having two copies of the variant more than doubled the risk of dementia in men, but not women,"" Professor Olynyk said.

""While the genetic variant itself cannot be changed, the brain pathways which it affects -- leading to the damage that causes dementia -- could potentially be treated if we understood more about it.""

Professor Olynyk said further research was needed to investigate why this genetic variant increased the risk of dementia for males but not females.

""The HFE gene is routinely tested for in most Western countries including Australia when assessing people for haemochromatosis -- a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron. Our findings suggest that perhaps this testing could be offered to men more broadly,"" Professor Olynyk said.

""While the HFE gene is critical for controlling iron levels in the body, we found no direct link between iron levels in the blood and increased dementia risk in affected men.

""This points to other mechanisms at play, possibly involving the increased risk of brain injury from inflammation and cell damage in the body.""

Co-author Professor Paul Lacaze, from Monash University, said the findings could help improve outcomes for people at risk of developing dementia.

""More than 400,000 Australians are currently living with dementia, with around a third of those being men. Understanding why men with the double H63D variant are at higher risk could pave the way for more personalised approaches to prevention and treatment,"" Professor Lacaze said.

""This study is a great example of how diverse Australian research groups and universities can collaborate effectively to learn more about these progressive diseases and ultimately improve health outcomes for people around the world.""

The ASPREE trial was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of daily low-aspirin in 19,114 healthy older people in Australia and the USA. Primarily undertaken to evaluate the risks versus benefits of daily low-dose aspirin in this cohort, it created a treasure trove of healthy ageing data that has underpinned a wealth of research studies.

The research was a collaboration between Curtin University, Monash University, The University of Melbourne, The Royal Children's Hospital, Murdoch Children's Research Institute and Fiona Stanley Hospital.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Singing to babies improves their mood","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250530124123.htm","Sat, 31 May 2025 01:33:50 GMT","

Singing to your infant can significantly boost the baby's mood, according to a recent Yale study published May 28 in Child Development.

Around the world and across cultures, singing to babies seems to come instinctively to caregivers. Now, new findings support that singing is an easy, safe, and free way to help improve the mental well-being of infants. Because improved mood in infancy is associated with a greater quality of life for both parents and babies, this in turn has benefits for the health of the entire family, the researchers say. The study also helps explain why musical behaviors may have evolved in parents.

""Singing is something that anyone can do, and most families are already doing,"" said Eun Cho, postdoctoral researcher at the Yale Child Study Center, and co-first author of the study. ""We show that this simple practice can lead to real health benefits for babies.""

""We don't always need to be focusing on expensive, complicated interventions when there are others that are just as effective and easy to adopt,"" added Lidya Yurdum, a PhD student in psychology at the University of Amsterdam, affiliated with the Child Study Center, and co-first author.

Increased singing improves infants' moods

The new study included 110 parents and their babies, most of whom were under the age of four months. The researchers randomly assigned the parents into two groups, encouraging one group to sing to their infants more frequently by teaching the parents new songs, providing karaoke-style instructional videos and infant-friendly songbooks, and sending weekly newsletters offering ideas for incorporating music into daily routines.

For four weeks, these parents received surveys on their smartphones at random times throughout the day. Parents answered questions related to infant mood, fussiness, time spent soothing, caregiver mood, and frequency of musical behavior. For instance, parents were asked to rate how positive or negative their baby's mood was within the last two to three hours before receiving the survey. The 56 parents in the control group also received an identical intervention in the four weeks following the initial experiment.

The researchers found that parents were successfully able to increase the amount of time they spent singing to their babies. ""When you ask parents to sing more and provide them with very basic tools to help them in that journey, it's something that comes very naturally to them,"" said Yurdum.

Not only did the parents sing more frequently, but they also chose to use music especially in one context in particular: calming their infants when they were fussy. ""We didn't say to parents, 'We think you should sing to your baby when she's fussy,' but that's what they did,"" said Samuel Mehr, an adjunct associate professor at the Child Study Center, and director of The Music Lab. Mehr is also the study's principal investigator. ""Parents intuitively gravitate toward music as a tool for managing infants' emotions, because they quickly learn how effective singing is at calming a fussy baby.""

Most surprisingly, the responses to the survey showed that increased singing led to a measurable improvement in infants' moods overall, compared to those in the control group -- in other words, parents who sang more rated their babies' moods as significantly higher. Importantly, improved mood was found in general, not just as an immediate response to music.

While singing did not significantly impact caregivers' moods in this study, Mehr believes that there could be follow-on effects on health in young families. ""Every parent knows that the mood of an infant affects everyone around that infant,"" said Mehr. ""If improvements to infant mood persist over time, they may well generalize to other health outcomes.""

Follow-up study to further explore singing's benefits

The team believes that the benefits of singing may be even stronger than the current study shows. ""Even before our intervention, these participating families were particularly musical,"" Yurdum explained. ""Despite that, and despite only four weeks of the intervention, we saw benefits. That suggests that the strength of singing to your babies would likely be even stronger in a family that does not already rely on music as a way of soothing their infants.""

The Child Study Center researchers are currently enrolling parents and babies under four months old in a follow-up study, ""Together We Grow,"" which will investigate the impact of infant-directed singing over an eight-month period.

Although the researchers did not see an improvement in caregiver mood within four weeks, they are intrigued to see if singing can help alleviate stress or conditions such as postpartum depression in the long term. They are also interested in exploring whether singing might have benefits beyond mood in infants, such as improved sleep.

Previous work from The Music Lab has shown that infant-directed music is universal in humans, and that humans can even infer context of songs -- such as whether it is for dancing or a lullaby -- in foreign languages and from other cultures. For Mehr, the new findings make sense in light of these basic science results. ""Our understanding of the evolutionary functions of music points to a role of music in communication,"" said Mehr. ""Parents send babies a clear signal in their lullabies: I'm close by, I hear you, I'm looking out for you -- so things can't be all that bad.""

The babies, apparently, are listening.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Mediterranean diet provides symptom relief for patients with IBS in pilot study","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250530124132.htm","Sat, 31 May 2025 02:07:37 GMT","

A pilot study from Michigan Medicine researchers found that the Mediterranean diet may provide symptom relief for people with irritable bowel syndrome.

Study participants were randomized into two groups, one following the Mediterranean diet and the other following the low FODMAP diet, a common restrictive diet for IBS.

In the Mediterranean diet group, 73% of the patients met the primary endpoint for symptom improvement, versus 81.8% in the low FODMAP group.

Irritable bowel syndrome affects an estimated 4-11% of all people, and a majority of patients prefer dietary interventions to medication.

The low FODMAP diet leads to symptom improvement in more than half of patients, but is restrictive and hard to follow.

Previous investigations from Michigan Medicine researchers into more accessible alternative diets led to a proposed ""FODMAP simple,"" which attempted to only restrict the food groups in the FODMAP acronym that are most likely to cause symptoms.

""Restrictive diets, such as low FODMAP, can be difficult for patients to adopt,"" said Prashant Singh, MBBS, Michigan Medicine gastroenterologist and lead author on the paper.

""In addition to the issue of being costly and time-consuming, there are concerns about nutrient deficiencies and disordered eating when trying a low FODMAP diet. The Mediterranean diet interested us as an alternative that is not an elimination diet and overcomes several of these limitations related to a low FODMAP diet.""

The Mediterranean diet is already popular among physicians for its benefits to cardiovascular, cognitive, and general health. Previous research on the effect of the Mediterranean diet on IBS, however, had yielded conflicting results.

In this pilot study, two groups of patients were provided with either a Mediterranean diet or the restriction phase of a low FODMAP diet for four weeks.

The primary endpoint was an FDA-standard 30% reduction in abdominal pain intensity after four weeks.

All the patients included in the study were diagnosed with either IBS-D (diarrhea) or IBS-M (mixed symptoms of constipation or diarrhea).

This study was the first randomized controlled trial to compare the Mediterranean diet to another potential diet. (Previous studies had compared the Mediterranean diet to the individuals' typical diets or were not randomized controlled trials.)

While the Mediterranean diet did provide symptom relief, the low FODMAP group experienced a greater improvement measured by both abdominal pain intensity and IBS symptom severity score.

Researchers found the results of this pilot study -- which 20 patients completed -- sufficiently encouraging to warrant future, larger controlled trials to investigate the potential of the Mediterranean diet as an effective intervention for patients with IBS.

""This study adds to a growing body of evidence which suggests that a Mediterranean diet might be a useful addition to the menu of evidence-based dietary interventions for patients with IBS,"" said William Chey, M.D., chief of Gastroenterology at the University of Michigan, president-elect of the American College of Gastroenterology, and senior author on the paper.

The researchers believe studies comparing long-term efficacy of the Mediterranean diet with long-term outcomes following the reintroduction and personalization phases of low FODMAP are needed.

An AI-powered system could soon take responsibility for evaluating the potential harms and privacy risks of up to 90% of updates made to Meta apps like Instagram and WhatsApp, according to internal documents reportedly viewed by NPR.

NPR says a 2012 agreement between Facebook (now Meta) and the Federal Trade Commission requires the company to conduct privacy reviews of its products, evaluating the risks of any potential updates. Until now, those reviews have been largely conducted by human evaluators.

Under the new system, Meta reportedly said product teams will be asked to fill out a questionaire about their work, then will usually receive an “instant decision” with AI-identified risks, along with requirements that an update or feature must meet before it launches.

This AI-centric approach would allow Meta to update its products more quickly, but one former executive told NPR it also creates “higher risks,” as “negative externalities of product changes are less likely to be prevented before they start causing problems in the world.”

In a statement, Meta seemed to confirm that it's changing its review system, but it insisted that only “low-risk decisions” will be automated,  while “human expertise” will still be used to examine “novel and complex issues.”

Welcome back to Week in Review! We've got a ton of stories for you this week, including a new AI-powered browser from Arc; not one but TWO hacks; Gemini email summaries; and much more. Have a great weekend!

Look out, Google: AI-powered search engine Perplexity released Perplexity Labs, which gives Pro subscribers a tool that can craft reports, spreadsheets, dashboards, and more. Perplexity Labs can conduct research and analysis using tools like web search, code execution, and chart and image creation to craft reports and visualizations. All in around 10 minutes. We haven't had a chance to test it, and knowing the shortcomings of AI, I'm sure not everything will come out flawlessly. But it certainly sounds pretty awesome. 

Luckey's luck: The feud between Oculus founder Palmer Luckey and Mark Zuckerberg appears to be over: The pair announced a collaboration between Facebook and Luckey's company Anduril to build extended reality (XR) devices for the U.S. military. The product family they're building is called EagleEye, which will be an ecosystem of devices.

Not awesome: We don't definitively know whether AI is beginning to take over roles previously done by humans. But a recent World Economic Forum survey found that 40% of employers plan to cut staff where AI can automate tasks. That can't be good.

This is TechCrunch's Week in Review, where we recap the week's biggest news. Want this delivered as a newsletter to your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here.

Everyone's making a browser: The Browser Company said this week that it's considering selling or open sourcing its browser, Arc Browser, to focus on a new AI-powered browser called Dia. And it's not the only one! Opera also said it's building a new AI-focused browser, and Perplexity teased its browser, Comet, a few months ago. 

At last: iPad users, rejoice! You can now talk to all your international friends with the new iPad-specific version of WhatsApp. Meta says that users will be able to take advantage of iPadOS multitasking features, such as Stage Manager, Split View, and Slide Over.

Oh, great: LexisNexis Risk Solutions, a data broker that uses personal information to help companies spot risks and fraud, reported a security breach affecting more than 364,000 people. A LexisNexis spokesperson told us that an unknown hacker accessed the company's GitHub account, and the stolen data includes names, dates of birth, phone numbers, postal and email addresses, Social Security numbers, and driver's license numbers.

And another one: Hackers reportedly accessed the personal phone of White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, obtaining contact information used to impersonate her and contact other high-ranking officials. It seems that AI was used to impersonate her voice.

Can it cook my meals? Gmail users no longer have to tap an option to summarize an email with AI. The AI will now automatically summarize the content when needed, without requiring user interaction. That means you have to opt out if you don't want Gemini summarizing your stuff. 

Billion with a B: General Catalyst has invested $1 billion into Grammarly, the 16-year-old writing assistant startup. Grammarly will use the new funds for its sales and marketing efforts, freeing up existing capital to make strategic acquisitions.

In the heights: Tinder is testing a new feature that will allow people to add a “height preference” in their search for love. This isn't a hard filter, Tinder says, as it won't actually block or exclude profiles but instead inform recommendations.

10 years in the making: Carma Technology, which was formed in 2007 by SOSV Ventures founder Sean O'Sullivan, filed a lawsuit earlier this year against Uber, alleging the company infringed on five of its patents. The lawsuit is fairly new, but the allegations go back almost a decade.

Port Royale (and many other games) kind of take the core aspects of Pirates (open world, combat, trade, pinnace to ship of the line, retirement, piracy/privateering, and so on) and then try to expand on it allowing one to operate multiple fleets, developing cities, and many other such things - with no particularly annoying aspect. And they're enjoyable, but somehow don't come anywhere near Pirates, and I can't think of any particular reason why not.Actually come to think of it, most of every great game I can think of also had some really really terrible aspects. For a more popular example, the combat in Skyrim is some of the worst in any RPG. But perhaps these failings make the rest of the game shine that much more.

Last month, Intel launched new power-optimized drivers for handheld devices, touting performance gains across various titles. With the latest Arc graphics driver version 32.0.101.6874, Intel is expanding these optimizations to all Core Ultra 200V-powered devices, across laptops and mini-PCs.

Since Intel's Arc is still in its early stages, many initial launches have improved with age due to subsequent driver improvements. This has been evident with Alchemist. Furthermore, despite Battlemage offering a relatively stronger and more stable platform at launch, it's clear there is still untapped potential, as shown by these software-driven improvements.

Intel's Arc graphics driver 32.0.101.6734 introduced notable low-power mode optimizations for Lunar Lake-powered handhelds, specifically the MSI Claw 8 AI+. After extensive validation and testing, Intel is expanding the scope of these optimizations to all devices, whether laptops or mini-PCs. First-party metrics suggest a 10% bump in performance across the board in nine titles, with the Core Ultra 7 258V at 17W, but your mileage will vary.



We'll have to verify these claims through independent testing. It's important to note these improvements are specifically for Intel's low-power Arc 130V and Arc 140V offerings, not the desktop-based Battlemage Arc B-series. The new drivers also address a slew of bugs across various productivity applications and games.

A noteworthy detail in the patch notes is the increased memory allocation for integrated Arc GPUs across Core Ultra Series 1 (Meteor Lake) and Series 2 (Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake) product lines, now supporting up to 57% compared to the previous 50% cap. Thus, a 16GB host system can allocate 9.12GB to the iGPU, as opposed to 8GB previously.

This isn't the first time Intel has offered improved performance through software updates, as a previous driver release from last October increased FPS by as much as 24%. This builds on earlier optimizations for the Arc platform, so we'll probably see further, likely less pronounced improvements down the road. Most software divisions are likely hard at work preparing the groundwork for next-generation Celestial (Xe3) graphics, set to be introduced with Panther Lake early next year.

If we are to believe a leaked manual for an upcoming Intel W880 motherboard, the Intel Arrow Lake-S processor will seemingly have a refresh successor. Popular hardware leaker momomo_us shared an image of the purported motherboard reference document with the CPU labeled Arrow Lake S/Arrow Lake S Refresh.

Previous rumors point to another generation of the Arrow Lake architecture, focusing only on high-end K and KF chips. So, it would make sense for motherboards designed for high-end workstations to take advantage of this refresh. Unfortunately, we do not see any other information on the document, so we will have to wait and see if manufacturers of more mainstream consumer and enthusiast motherboards will release new models for this alleged Arrow Lake update.

The Intel Core Ultra 200S series arrived on the scene in October 2024, around two months after the company released its disastrous financial report. Team Blue sorely needed a win to help it get back on course—unfortunately, the Arrow Lake wasn't it, as sales for its latest processor stagnated just a week after its launch. After half a year on the market, the company still struggles to sell its AI chips, with many customers preferring the older Raptor Lake CPUs.

One reason behind this could be the chip's lack of gaming prowess. It has consistently trailed behind AMD's outstanding offerings, especially the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, and was even outperformed by Intel's own last-generation chips. And even though the Arrow Lake processors boast an NPU and offer higher AI processing power, most buyers don't care about that. This, combined with the higher prices, meant that there was low demand for these CPUs.

If the Arrow Lake-S Refresh chips are indeed arriving, Intel must address the gaming performance issues. Otherwise, buyers would shun them and instead flock towards options that deliver more FPS and do not bottleneck other components.

Despite all the negativity in the gaming space for the Arrow Lake-S chips, Intel has made some interesting innovations in the processor. It has improved power consumption and efficiency, reducing its cooling requirements. It's also a productivity powerhouse, with the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K beating most of its competitors in Cinebench.

This was the first Intel desktop CPU to use a chiplet-based design, so it's bound to have first-generation hiccups. Hopefully, the company can fix some of the concerns with the refresh, allowing us to get the most out of the Arrow Lake architecture.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about one out of every three adults around the world lives with high blood pressure. 

Clinically known as hypertension, this medical condition occurs when the force with which blood flows through the arteries is too high.

Past research shows that having high blood pressure can increase a person's risk for several health issues, including stroke, aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and dementia. 

In addition to medications, people are able to manage their high blood pressure through a variety of lifestyle changes, including not smoking, getting enough exercise, managing stress, and eating a healthy diet. 

While the DASH diet has traditionally been the go-to diet for hypertension, over the last few years the Mediterranean and ketogenic (keto) diets have also gained in popularity. 

A study published in April 2024 reported that following the Mediterranean diet was linked to a lower risk for high blood pressure. Another study published in July 2019 showed that following a low carbohydrate diet like the keto diet helped lower blood pressure readings in people with type 2 diabetes.

Now, a new study offers further evidence that both the Mediterranean and keto diets can help lower a person's blood pressure and improve cardiovascular health measurements in people who have obesity or overweight.

The findings were published in the journal Nutrients. 

For this study, researchers recruited 26 adults who had obesity or overweight, had high-normal blood pressure or grade 1 hypertension, and low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk scores. 

Eleven of the study participants were randomly assigned to follow the Mediterranean diet, and the remaining 15 followed the keto diet over a period of three months.

At the study's conclusion, researchers found that participants in both diet groups experienced a decrease in blood pressure and weight loss after three months. 

Scientists also found that participants in both diet groups experienced an increase in their fat-free mass — the total mass of the body excluding fat — and a decrease in their body fat, blood lipid levels, and insulin concentrations. 

There was one area where researchers reported a difference between the Mediterranean and keto diets. They reported that participants following the keto diet had a higher level of “nocturnal dipping” than those in the keto group.

“Nocturnal dipping refers to the natural decrease in blood pressure that occurs when we sleep,” Cheng-Han Chen, MD, a board certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA — who is not associated with this study — told Medical News Today. 

“It is a measure of healthy blood pressure regulation, and abnormal nocturnal dipping patterns have been associated with increased risk of heart disease,” he said.

A 10-20% dip in blood pressure while you sleep is considered normal. 

Past studies show that not experiencing nocturnal dipping, or the reverse of it, known as nocturnal hypertension, can increase a person's risk for cardiovascular disease. 

When asked about his reaction to this study's findings, Chen commented that while the Mediterranean and keto diets are somewhat different in their food restrictions, the study results suggest that there may be different dietary techniques that can achieve the same beneficial outcome, depending on the food preferences of an individual.

“Metabolic syndrome — including high blood pressure, abdominal obesity, high blood sugar, and disordered lipids — remains a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease,” he explained. “Lifestyle modification, such as diet improvements, will be essential in order to help control the burden of heart disease in our society.”

“Further research including larger controlled studies with a more diverse population will be necessary to confirm these findings, and to evaluate for any potential benefit to clinical outcomes,” Chen added. 

MNT also spoke with Mir Ali, MD, a board certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon, and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this research, who commented that its findings are in line with what he recommends to patients. 

“Both the keto and the Mediterranean diets emphasize a reduction in carbohydrate and sugar intake, and that's what we found is the best way to kind of shift the body into burning fat is by reducing all the carbohydrates and sugars.”— Mir Ali, MD

“Unfortunately, obesity is an increasing problem in the U.S. and other westernized countries, so the more we can find ways to combat that, find foods that are going to help people lose weight and head to a healthier diet, then maybe some of these larger food manufacturers will start shifting their focus to foods that just taste good to foods that may actually be helpful,” Ali continued. 

Because this was a smaller study, Ali suggested expanding it to a larger patient base or population to refine it further. 

“What is it about these two types of diets that are helpful?,” he asked. “Is it reducing processed foods or is it more reducing the carbohydrates and sugars? So there are some differences between the diets, and trying to define further what is optimal between these two diets.” 

While both the Mediterranean and keto diets are popular dietary plans for people to follow, they may not be right for everyone. We asked Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, for her top tips for readers on how to decide which diet is personally best for them to follow if they want to lose weight and lower their blood pressure. 

“Meeting with a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) is recommended to further explore which dietary pattern may be most appropriate for an individual's needs, current health condition, preferences, goals, genetics and lifestyle,” Richard said. “RDNs are trained to bridge the gap between science and everyday life. If you're looking to manage weight or blood pressure in a way that's realistic and sustainable, working with an RDN can be a game-changer.” 

“It is also important to consider if the specific dietary pattern is sustainable for a long period of time and can be a lifestyle versus a controlled experiment or ‘temporary fix',” she continued. “Think of dietary patterns like a playlist — the right mix can set the tone for a healthier rhythm in your body and the days ahead.”

Richard suggested honing in on increasing foods rich in nutrients with many health benefits, such as:

“There's no ‘one-size-fits-all' when it comes to dietary patterns — unless it's a kitchen apron. I encourage clients and patients to try to move away from chasing labels —‘Mediterranean,' ‘low-carb,' ‘plant-based'— and move toward tuning into how food functions for our unique needs.”— Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN

 May 31, 2025  

In the treatment of newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome–positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), patients who fail to achieve initial molecular response with the third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) ponatinib following induction can nevertheless go on to achieve minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity — and at higher rates than the earlier generation TKI imatinib.

“These results support the clinical benefit and tolerability of continuing ponatinib beyond cycle 3 in patients with newly diagnosed, Ph-positive ALL who do not achieve MRD-negativity by the end of induction,” first author Ibrahim Aldoss, MD, of City of Hope hospital in Duarte, California, told Medscape Medical News.

The study was presented this week at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. 

Ph+ ALL, the most common subtype of adult ALL and once associated with a particularly poor prognosis, has seen significantly improved outcomes with TKIs in combination with chemotherapy or steroids. However, even with the third generation of TKIs representing the standard of care, relapses can occur due to variant-acquired resistance, particularly T315I. 

Ponatinib was designed to address that challenge, effectively inhibiting BCR-ABL1 with or without any single-mutation variants, including T315I.

The previous global, phase 3, open-label PhALLCON trial represented the first head-to-head comparison of ponatinib (30 mg/day) with the first-generation imatinib (600 mg/day), along with reduced-intensity chemotherapy followed by monotherapy of either drug until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 

The trial met its primary endpoint of no sign of molecular disease (MRD-negative complete response), which correlates with long-term outcomes, by the end of cycle 3 of induction, with ponatinib showing a significantly higher rate vs imatinib (34.4% vs 16.7%; P = .002), and comparable safety outcomes.

To investigate the key question of the effects of further treatment among the majority of patients who did not achieve MRD negativity by the end of induction, or 3 cycles of low-density chemotherapy, Aldoss and colleagues conducted the current post-hoc analysis of 113 patients (73 receiving ponatinib, 40 imatinib) who continued treatment following the end of induction, 

Of those patients, 48% in the ponatinib group (n = 35) and 33% with imatinib (n = 13) did achieve MRD negativity after induction cycle 4, day 1.

The median duration of MRD negativity was not reached with ponatinib compared with 3.8 months with imatinib treatment.

Overall, 16 patients (10 receiving ponatinib, 6 imatinib) went on to have a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). 

Among 140 patients who did not achieve MRD negativity by the end of induction, the median event-free survival was not reached with ponatinib therapy compared with 24.8 months with imatinib. The 2-year rates of event-free survival in the two groups were 82% and 62%, respectively.

The rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were similar in the patients who had not achieved MRD negativity by the end of induction, at 100% with ponatinib and 98% imatinib.

In addition, 71% and 54% of patients, respectively, had a dose modification (discontinuation, reduction, or interruption) due to TEAEs.

Of the 48 patients with MRD negativity after cycle 4, day 1, 100% of patients in each treatment group had TEAEs, and 69% and 62% had dose modification due to TEAEs.

While ponatinib has previously been associated with increased vascular toxicity and arterial occlusive events, particularly among patients receiving higher doses for longer periods, those events were rare in the current study and not significantly different between the two arms, Aldoss said.

He added that the improvement is likely the result of a lowering of the initial dose in the PhALLCON study to 30 mg/day compared with the prior use of 45 mg/day — and a further reduction to 15 mg/day after induction likely helped reduce those effects. 

“We feel that using a more optimized, safer lower dose was actually the reason why we're seeing comparable safety and lower arterial occlusive events in this study,” Aldoss said. 

The benefits were observed across the evaluated subgroups, including patients older than age 60 years, which is important due to previous research showing some increased risk with ponatinib among older adults.

With more stringent criteria in the trial excluding patients with significant cardiovascular disease, Aldoss noted that, “if anything, the benefit was actually more prominent in patients older than 60.” 

He therefore recommended consideration of that criteria in making patient selection.

Importantly, in the PhALLCON trial, the proportion of patients in the ponatinib arm who went on to receive HSCT was lower compared with imatinib, which could notably benefit older patients who may not respond as well to such treatment.

“The potency of ponatinib in combination with low-dose chemotherapy or no chemotherapy may render HSCT unnecessary for older or frail patients who achieve a 3-month MRD-negative complete remission,” the authors conclude in the study.

While the survival estimation can otherwise require long follow-up analysis, MRD negativity is increasingly seen as an important surrogate measure of long-term survival.

In one recent meta-analysis, MRD negativity at the end of induction had a significantly greater prognostic value in terms of event-free survival and long-term survival in patients with PH-positive ALL. 

The current findings suggest such benefits may be achieved even when there is a delay in MRD negativity status after induction, Aldoss noted.

“This analysis supports [the conclusion] that a clinical benefit in event-free survival is observed, even if you don't achieve the MRD negativity at the end of induction,” he said. 

Following the publication of the PhALLCON trial, the US Food and Drug Administration granted ponatinib accelerated approval for the indication of Ph-positive ALL in March 2024.

In an accompanying editorial, Jacqueline S. Garcia, MD, of the Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, and colleagues speculated about the role of ponatinib in the context of other promising options.

“It is unclear whether PhALLCON's ponatinib regimen will be preferred against second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, especially regimens that incorporate blinatumomab or allosteric BCR-ABL1 inhibitors,” they write.

Importantly, with long-term data showing durable hematologic and molecular responses with combined dasatinib and blinatumomab, thereby offering a chemotherapy-free and toxicity-sparing induction and consolidation regimen, for instance, the option of ponatinib and reduced-intensity chemotherapy “may not be the optimal first choice for all Ph+ ALL patients,” they say.

A notable limitation of the study was that MRD was not assessed with next-generation sequencing (NGS), Pamela Sung, MD, PhD, an assistant professor in the Departments of Medicine and Pharmacology & Therapeutics, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, New York, who co-moderated the ASCO session, told Medscape Medical News. 

“NGS is more sensitive and specific than BCR-ABL1  PCR for B-ALL MRD detection,” she said. “It is increasingly being recognized that multi-lineage or ‘CML-like' ALL exists, where patients are MRD-positive by BCR-ABL PCR but negative by NGS.” 

Such patients have a similar relapse rate to those who are MRD-negative by both measures, but it is not known how many patients experience such discordance, Sung noted. 

The findings are nevertheless important, not so much in showing the rate of MRD at a certain point in time, but the potential trajectory in MRD over the course of treatment, Sung noted.

“Typically, we would continue the current therapy regimen so long as the MRD is continuing to decrease,” she explained. “However, if unable to clear at the end of 1 to 2 cycles of consolidation, we would recommend allogeneic transplant if eligible.

“These new data support this strategy, using a high potency TKI with few deaths and relapses in the ponatinib arm (10%) for this subset of patients that were MRD-positive at the end of induction.

“Nearly half of patients converted to MRD-negative by the end of treatment with ponatinib, many of whom were negative at [a deeper molecular response] of MR4.5.”

The study was sponsored by Takeda Development Center Americas, Inc. 

Aldoss disclosed relationships with AbbVie, Agios, Amgen, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Kite Pharma, Syndax, Takeda, Pfizer, and Macrogenics. Sung reported no relevant financial relationships.

A new device that monitors the waste-removal system of the brain may help to prevent Alzheimer's and other neurological diseases, according to a study published today in Nature Biomedical Engineering. 

 In the study, participants were asleep when they wore the device: a head cap embedded with electrodes that measures shifts in fluid within brain tissue, the neural activity from sleep to wakefulness and changes in the brain's blood vessels. 

By measuring these three features, the researchers found they could monitor the brain's glymphatic system, which acts as a waste-removal and nutrient-delivery system. 

This is the first time that researchers have been able to track the flow of glymphatic fluid in individuals at different levels of sleep through a single night. Previously these processes could only be monitored at university research centers by using MRI, an approach that is too slow to track minute changes in individuals' sleep stages. 

 We have assumed that this system operated in a sort of 'on-off' manner: 'on' during sleep - particularly during slow-wave sleep - and 'off' during waking.""

Jeffrey Iliff, coauthor of the study and professor in psychiatry and neurology, University of Washington School of Medicine

These assumptions, Iliff added, were based on rodent studies he and others conducted over the last decade. When the research involved human participants, however, the investigators were surprised at the findings. 

They found that the glymphatic system was active in both deep and REM sleep, as well as when the person was waking up. Rather than turning on and off, switchlike, this clearance function appeared to accelerate the longer a person slept, and then slow down gradually as they woke, Iliff noted. 

""It lets us monitor how this system is related to sleep and how it's affected by sleep disruption in humans - something that is critical if we are trying to understand the role that this biology plays in clinical psychiatric and neurological conditions,"" Iliff said. 

These findings are important because the glymphatic system plays a vital role in clearing brain proteins whose abnormal accumulation is linked to disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, he said. 

""This is a critical step in the development of therapeutics targeting glymphatic function,"" Iliff said. ""And if you can develop therapeutics that improve glymphatic function, you might be able to treat or prevent conditions like Alzheimer's disease."" 

The wearable device, developed by California-based Applied Cognition, could have several potential uses, Iliff suggested. It could help scientists define whether glymphatic dysfunction contributes to the development conditions such as Alzheimer's, traumatic brain injury and migraine headaches. It could inform the development of new therapeutics to improve glymphatic function. And it could be used to identify patients at risk for these conditions, who might benefit most from these new therapeutics. 

This study was conducted with participants at the University of Washington Medical Center – Montlake and the University of Florida between October 2022 and June 2023. In all 35 participants participated in benchmarking study in Florida, and an additional 14 in replication study in Seattle. All participants ranged between 56 and 66 years of age. 

Swati Rane Levendovszky an MRI physicist and former director of UW Medicine's  Diagnostic Imaging Sciences Center, also worked on the project. She now works at the University of Kansas Medical Center. 

""This work is pivotal in defining the role glymphatic dysfunction plays in Alzheimer's and discovering therapies to rescue it,"" said Dr. Paul Dagum, CEO of Applied Cognition. ""Our platform has already identified a promising drug candidate that improves glymphatic clearance in early clinical trials."" 

Iliff's lab studies the glymphatic system and its role in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and traumatic brain injury. 

 This study was funded by Applied Cognition, where Iliff served as chair of the company's scientific advisory board and received compensation in that role.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Leading health organizations release guidance on nutrition support for GLP-1 obesity therapies","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250531/Leading-health-organizations-release-guidance-on-nutrition-support-for-GLP-1-obesity-therapies.aspx","Sat, 31 May 2025 06:04:00 GMT","

Four leading organizations in lifestyle medicine, obesity medicine, and nutrition-the American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM), the American Society for Nutrition (ASN), the Obesity Medicine Association (OMA), and The Obesity Society (TOS)-have jointly released a clinical advisory titled ""Nutritional Priorities to Support GLP-1 Therapy for Obesity."" Published across four peer-reviewed journals, this consensus-based guidance reflects an interdisciplinary collaboration to help clinicians support patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists for obesity care with evidence-based nutritional and behavioral strategies.

GLP-1 therapies, including both single and combination agents, have emerged as powerful tools in the management of obesity, demonstrating average placebo-adjusted weight reductions of 5–18% in clinical trials, along with improvements in metabolic, functional and cardiovascular outcomes. However, sustaining these benefits over time and maximizing patient outcomes require comprehensive care that integrates lifestyle intervention-particularly nutrition therapy-into the treatment plan.

""GLP-1s represent an important advancement in obesity care,"" said lead author and advisory chair Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, DrPH, of Tufts University. ""But these medications can present challenges, including gastrointestinal side effects, risk of micronutrient deficiencies, muscle and bone loss, poor long-term adherence with subsequent weight regain, and high costs; and, on their own, are not enough. Nutrition therapy and lifestyle support are essential components to address these challenges, help patients maximize and maintain health gains over time, and ensure we are using these drugs wisely, effectively, and without bankrupting the healthcare system.""

The advisory outlines eight key nutritional priorities to support patients on GLP-1 medications, emphasizing the importance of (1) patient-centered initiation of therapy, (2) careful baseline nutritional assessment, (3) management of gastrointestinal side effects, (4) personalized, nutrient-dense, minimally processed diets, (5) prevention of micronutrient deficiencies (6) adequate protein intake and strength training to preserve lean mass, (7) leveraging a good diet to maximize weight reduction, and (8) promoting other lifestyle changes around activity, sleep, mental stress, substance use, and social connections to maximize long-term success.

Recent evidence supports this integrative model. In studies evaluating combined pharmacologic and lifestyle interventions, patients receiving both GLP-1 therapy and structured nutrition guidance achieved greater weight loss, better adherence, and were more likely to sustain weight loss after discontinuing medication compared to those receiving pharmacotherapy alone (Wadden et al., 2021; Kushner et al., 2022).

Despite the known benefits, most individuals prescribed GLP-1s do not currently receive adequate nutritional counseling or behavioral support. This advisory seeks to fill that gap with practical, interdisciplinary guidance for implementation in clinical practice.

GLP-1s are reshaping the landscape of obesity treatment, but it's clear that medication alone is not a complete solution. This consensus-based guidance highlights the critical role of nutrition in supporting patients on GLP-1 therapy, with clear recommendations for health care providers to optimize outcomes, reduce risks, and fill urgent gaps in care through practical, evidence-informed nutrition strategies.""

John E. Courtney, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of the American Society for Nutrition

While certain considerations-such as GI tolerance and micronutrient balance-are important for clinicians to address, the advisory emphasizes that a proactive lifestyle-based approach can mitigate risks and optimize outcomes. With obesity prevalence continuing to rise worldwide, the integration of nutrition therapy into GLP-1-based care offers a scalable strategy to extend the clinical and economic value of these therapies.

Clinicians are encouraged to use the advisory's tools and frameworks to help patients translate nutrition guidance into sustainable behaviors, making lifestyle medicine an active ingredient in every ""prescription"" for obesity care.

The joint advisory is simultaneously published in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM), The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (ASN), Obesity Pillars® (OMA) and Obesity (TOS). Leading researchers will discuss the advisory and its implications during two sessions at NUTRITION 2025, the flagship annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition to be held May 31–June 3 in Orlando, Florida:

The United States Women's National Team hit the field for their first match of the May/June international window this afternoon when they take on China at Allianz Field in St. Paul, Minnesota. The USWNT once again have a roster that has some newer faces as head coach Emma Hayes continues to evaluate players and identify a core group that she can rely on when Women's World Cup qualifying begins next year.

China, ranked 17th in the world, is always a tough out, and the two teams have a history that dates back to 1986. China is the second most common opponent for the USWNT, with this being the 61st time the two teams have faced each other (only Canada, at 66 matches, have faced the USWNT more). They present the kind of test some of the newer players need as they try to show they belong on the international level and with the national team.

It should be a nice afternoon in St. Paul as the USWNT renew their rivalry with China.

ALAJUELA, Costa Rica – The U.S. U-20 Women's National Team opened Group A play at the Concacaf Women's U-20 Championship with a convincing 8-0 win over Guyana.

Forward Izzy Engle led the team with four goals, becoming the eighth player in team history to score four goals in a U-20 Concacaf Championship match. Midfielder Kennedy Fuller also had a standout performance, converting a penalty kick and providing three assists.

The USA will now face Puerto Rico (June 1 at 1 p.m. ET on FS1) and Costa Rica (April 3 at 4 p.m. ET on FS2) with two more wins guaranteeing the USA a spot in the 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup.

The USA wasted little time getting on the score sheet. In the fifth minute, defender Aven Alvarez, the only player on the U.S. side with U-20caps coming into the match, slipped a pass to Fuller, who juked around her defender into open space five yards outside the penalty box and ripped a shot that smacked the right post. The rebound fell right to Engle, who easily converted the first goal of the match.

Fuller would get her goal in the 13th minute after converting a penalty kick. Engle drew the foul in the box when her defender slid across her body and took her down while fighting for the ball in the box.

Then came the first of two Fuller-to-Engle connections. In the 24th minute, Fuller sent an in-swinging cross toward the back post and found the head of Engle, who calmly redirected the ball past the diving ‘keeper to make it 3-0.

One minute after the Engle set piece goal, midfielder Linda Ullmark drove down the left channel, then cut around her defender toward the box before sending a centering pass into the middle. Midfielder Sealey Strawn got to the end of the pass and snuck the ball inside the left post on her first touch to make it 4-0.

Ullmark then made it 5-0 in the 37th minute. After receiving a pass from Fuller on the left side of the box, Ullmar kturned and fired a right-footed strike from about ten yards away to beat the ‘keeper into the bottom right corner of the goal.

Engle bookended the six-goal first half in the 41st minute. With the ball at her feet and between two defenders, Engle danced around her opponents to give herself space at the top of the box and then stung a shot into the top right corner of the net to close the half with three goals and a 6-0 lead.

Just two minutes into the second half, Engle notched her fourth goal of the match. Fuller assisted her for the second time of the match, slipping a pass through the defender to get Engle who was charging into the box. The forward cut her shot across her body and placed the ball inside the far-right post to make it 7-0.

Midfielder Emma Johnson finished off the USA scoring in the 78th minute. Defender Kate Scott ripped a shot from just outside of the top of the box and forced the Guyanese ‘keeper into a diving save. But the rebound fell right to Johnson, who calmly finished to give the U.S. the 8-0 lead.

The USA outshot Guyana 34-2 and did not allow a shot on goal.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. – Lionel Messi and Inter Miami will play their final match before the FIFA Club World Cup on Saturday night against the Columbus Crew at Chase Stadium.

Messi has scored three goals in his last two matches, and is expected to play against Columbus. His status will be confirmed when Inter Miami announces its starting lineup an hour before the match.

Columbus Crew and Inter Miami have been two of the best clubs in Major League Soccer in recent years, but both are struggling in 2025.

Inter Miami has just two wins in its last 10 games – They beat the Crew 1-0 in Cleveland on April 19, and beat CF Montreal 4-2 last Wednesday. Columbus has four wins, four draws and two losses in its last 10 matches.

Columbus Crew won MLS Cup title in 2023, and Inter Miami beat Columbus to win the MLS Supporters' Shield in 2024. Both clubs also won the Leagues Cup tournaments – Inter Miami in 2023, and Columbus in 2024.

After the Columbus match, Messi will re-join the Argentine national team for two World Cup qualifiers, before Inter Miami enters the Club World Cup.

Here's everything you need to know about the Inter Miami vs. Columbus Crew match, and stay tuned here for live updates from USA TODAY Sports:

The match begins Saturday night at 7:30 p.m. ET (8:30 p.m. in Argentina) inside Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

The match is available to live stream on MLS Season Pass via Apple TV.

Messi is expected to play, but his status will be confirmed when Inter Miami announces its starting lineup an hour before the match.

Inter Miami is the favorite to win at home (+105), while Columbus Crew is an underdog on the road (+195), and a draw has longer odds (+290) than an outright victory. The over/under is set at 3.5 goals, according to BETMGM.

Inter Miami has won three of its last four matches against Columbus Crew.

The match is an unofficial start to another busy summer for Messi – the Argentine World Cup champion and eight-time Ballon d'Or winner – in the twilight of his legendary career in the United States.

Here's what's next for Messi after the Columbus match:","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

Sounders GM Craig Waibel says the team is more focused on getting the right player, not the player they can get fastest.

RENTON — In an attempt to make it easier for participating teams to bolster their rosters for the Club World Cup and address a quirk of tournament timing relative to player contracts expiring, FIFA decided to grant them an additional 10-day transfer window. 

Although U.S. Soccer has granted the Seattle Sounders, Inter Miami and potentially LAFC the ability to use that window that opens Sunday through June 10, it's unclear how active they will be.

Sounders GM Craig Waibel doesn't seem to be in any hurry to get a signing done during this window.

“We're not going to do anything for a three-week tournament,” he said. “We're gonna do something that makes the team better over time.”

As Waibel has said repeatedly over the past few months, the Sounders' scouting efforts are mostly focused on identifying and signing a U22 Initiative Player. 

“We've targeted quite a few top players in Europe and South America,” Waibel said. “Right now, we put the press on those players to make decisions.”

While the U22 Initiative allows MLS teams to spend effectively unlimited amounts on transfer fees while not counting any more than $200,000 against the salary cap, there are nuances to the rule that make it a bit more complicated. The main one is that players can't be older than 22 in the year the signing is made. But they also can't be paid more than the maximum salary — this year, that's $743,750. 

Combine those two elements together, and the type of players being targeted are almost by definition relatively unproven. The success rate across MLS has been, at best, mixed.

At the same time, the type of players who fit the profile the Sounders are targeting tend to have options.

“Part of this is we're starting to own up to what we are, which is we're becoming a better league – probably the top 10 league in the world – so we're competing for players now than they're not just talking to us,” Waibel said. “They're talking to us and teams in the fifth, sixth, seventh best leagues in the world.

“We're in competition with a lot of big name teams now, it's pretty fun. It's pretty fun to be a part of, and we've just got to figure out how to win one or two of those conversations. We're optimistic, but at the same time, a lot of good young players have choices to make.”

The transfer market is, of course, a two-way street and the Sounders could end up as sellers as well.

The prospect around whom there's been the most attention is Obed Vargas, who has few peers around the world who can match the amount of high-level experience he's already accumulated as a 19-year-old.

While that may have piqued the interest of just about every team in the world, it hasn't yet led to any official offers.

“One of the biggest debates I think a lot of teams are having is, is he ready to come in and contribute to their team, and do they need him?” Waibel said.  “The significance of the investment to bring a player like Obed in, you need to do it with the timing that he's going to be on the field.”

The other player who seems to be on a lot of foreign teams' radars is Pedro de la Vega, who the Sounders signed as a Young Designated Player before last season. After struggling to stay fit in 2024, de la Vega has been more consistently available this year and has been able to showcase more of his talents.

Among the teams who has previously shown interest in de la Vega is one of the teams the Sounders will be facing in the Club World Cup.

“He's starting to perform as I think a lot of us expected him to,” Waibel said. “Physically, he's developed. He's put the work in over the last year. He's mentally in a much better place, physically, he's contributing in a much higher rate.”

But Waibel insists he's not necessarily itching to sell, either.

“The structure of MLS is there's not a lot of reward for selling players,” he said. “There is financial reward to the club, which we take into consideration, we are a business. 

“In terms of terms of staying competitive, winning games, and honoring both our commitment to our players as well as their commitment to their careers and their dreams, that's a balance. When opportunities come up, there's nothing hidden. When official offers come in, any player I have will know. I have always communicated official offers to players because I think it's important that transparency exists, and sometimes we as a club will make the decision that it's not the right time or not the right business opportunity, and sometimes the players do.”","{'href': 'https://www.sounderatheart.com', 'title': 'Sounder at Heart'}","soccer"

Erling Haaland appears to be making the most of his brief time off this summer after enduring a nightmare campaign with Manchester City.

The no-nonsense striker brutally admitted he and his team-mates were not 'good enough' as they went trophyless for the first time in eight years and surrendered the Premier League title to rivals Liverpool, finishing in third. 

City also endured disappointment in the Champions League, having crashed out in the last-16 to Real Madrid, leading Pep Guardiola to return to the drawing board.

Already in the middle of refreshing his squad, Guardiola will shortly take his players to the United States for the new-look Club World Cup, which begins on June 15. 

They won 2-0 at Fulham on the last day of the season to secure a spot at the top table in Europe but will return to action just 24 days later. 

Enjoying a breather before hopping on board City's flight out, Haaland took to social media to share a photo of himself holding two large lobsters.

Haaland endured a disappointing campaign as City went without a major trophy

But the ace will soon be jetting out to the United States with the rest of Pep Guardiola's squad

The simple caption read: 'Lobzter'.

Haaland is now back fit and firing after recovering from an ankle injury sustained in the 2-1 victory over Bournemouth in March, but he was powerless to prevent City from losing the FA Cup final against Crystal Palace at Wembley.

He was on target at Craven Cottage, however, and will hope to find the back of the net again as City target another Club World Cup triumph, having won it back in 2023. 

In the new-look edition, City will play Moroccan side Wydad AC on 18 June, Al Ain from the United Arab Emirates on 23 June and finally Juventus three days later. 

The top two teams from each of the eight groups will qualify for the knockout stages while the sides that reach the final on 13 July will have played seven games.

Exactly a month later, the new Premier League season will get underway.

Despite the gruelling schedule awaiting City's players, club chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak has insisted the squad will be 'hungry' for silverware in the United States.

Al Mubarak said: 'They want to come back, and they want to come back hungry. I can see the hunger and these players, they want to come back to pre-season.

Haaland was powerless to prevent City from losing the FA Cup final to Crystal Palace

City could play as many as seven games at the Club World Cup in a breathless summer

'Normally these players are off and they're starting to think about vacation time etc. Honestly, every player I spoke to was telling me, we're coming back.

'We're ready to come back in three weeks' time. I was speaking to Rodri as an example, he's looking for games. Erling didn't want to go on vacation.

'He wanted to stay with the physios and prepare for next season. That's the attitude you want and that's exactly why you see me so positive.

'We're going to come back strong, with a lot of positivity.'

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Real Madrid confirm defensive exit before Club World Cup flight","https://www.football-espana.net/2025/05/31/real-madrid-defensive-exit-club-world-cup","Sat, 31 May 2025 09:13:52 GMT","

Real Madrid have confirmed one player will leave the club before the start of their FIFA Club World Cup campaign.

With the 2024/25 domestic season failing to yield a trophy, Real Madrid have already opted for changes, as Xabi Alonso lands in to replace Carlo Ancelotti.

A deal for Dean Huijsen was agreed before Alonso signed his contract and an agreement has now been confirmed to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold before the flight to the USA.

Short term extensions were agreed with club captain Luka Modric and veteran defender Lucas Vazquez and the pair will both play in the tournament.

Vazquez has a La Liga offer reportedly available with Modric weighing up proposals from Italy, the USA and Saudi Arabia.

However, one name that will not be on the flight list to Miami is Jesus Vallejo, with his contract up at the end of June.

Los Blancos have confirmed Vallejo will leave as a free agent alongside Modric and Vazquez this summer.

The 28-year-old made just four appearances in 2024/25 following his return from a loan spell at Granada last season.

Vallejo's deal expires on June 30, and as per Mundo Deportivo, no clause will be activated to bring him to North America as he looks for a new club for the 2025/26 season.

The expanded tournament kicks off on June 14 with Real Madrid's first game against Al Hilal on June 18.

That is followed by Group H clashes with Pachuca on June 22 and RB Salzburg on June 26 before the potential start of a knockout stage campaign from June 30/July 1.

With the majority of Alonso's squad away on international duty in the first week of June, Real Madrid have not confirmed their travel plans, with certain players potentially flying to the USA separately depending on their international commitments.

                Still just 27 years old, Lautaro Martinez has already achieved what many players dream of achieving in football.

Over the past few seasons, Lautaro Martinez has firmly cemented his place among the most successful and consistent forwards in world football. With his relentless work ethic, technical flair and scoring instincts, the Argentine striker has played a pivotal role in both Inter Milan's dominance in Italy and Argentina's resurgence on the international stage.

Having burst onto the European scene with Inter in 2018 following his move from Racing Club, Lautaro has since racked up an impressive 151 goals in 330 appearances for the Nerazzurri. His impact has been nothing short of transformative. He has become the complete package at Inter – an attacking engine and a leader in crucial moments. 

Notably, Lautaro became the first foreign player to score 150 goals for Inter. He overtook the legendary Roberto Boninsegna and equalled his Argentinian compatriot Hernan Crespo's tally for the most goals scored in a Champions League campaign with nine goals in the ongoing season.

On the international front, his influence has grown steadily. Since his debut for Argentina in 2018, Martinez has earned over 70 caps and scored 32 goals, often leading the Argentina attack with great intensity and composure.

Yes, Lautaro Martinez is a FIFA World Cup winner.

He was part of Argentina's historic squad that clinched the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. While Lionel Messi rightfully grabbed most of the headlines, Martinez played a key role throughout the qualification and tournament campaign, providing depth and tenacity in the final third. 

Despite entering the tournament with an ankle injury, he started the first two matches but was later replaced in the starting XI by Julian Alvarez. Though he didn't score during the tournament, MartInez played a vital role off the bench, most notably converting the decisive penalty in the shootout win over the Netherlands in the quarter-finals. He also featured as a substitute in the final against France, helping Argentina secure their historic World Cup triumph. His achievements at the World Cup firmly placed him among the elite group of Argentines who have conquered football's biggest stage.

Lautaro Martínez is already Inter's leading Champions League scorer of all-time 🤯🐂🇦🇷 pic.twitter.com/gqWXTaJTLd

Serie A Titles: 2 (2020/21 and 2023/24)

Coppa Italia Titles: 2 (2021/22 and 2022/23)

Supercoppa Italiana Titles: 3 (2021, 2022 and 2023)

Serie A Top Scorer: 2023/24 season

First Foreign Player to Score 150 Goals for Inter

Serie A Most Valuable Player: 2023/24

FIFA World Cup: 1 (Qatar 2022)

CONMEBOL Copa America: 2 (Brazil 2021 and USA 2024)

Copa America Golden Boot: 2024

Copa America Final Goal Scorer: Scored in the final

CONMEBOL/UEFA Finalissima: 2022

Across his career so far:

This brings Lautaro's overall senior tally to 210 goals in just over 460 appearances, which is quite a remarkable return for a player still in his prime. Still just 27, Lautaro Martinez has already achieved what many players dream of achieving in football. If he continues this trajectory, he's destined to go down as one of the most decorated and revered strikers of his generation.

Jack Draper beats teenage Brazilian star Joao Fonseca in straight sets in the third round of the French Open at Roland-Garros; you can watch the ATP and WTA tours on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Saturday 31 May 2025 16:54, UK

​​​​​​Jack Draper swept aside 18-year-old Joao Fonseca to reach the last 16 at the French Open and remain on course for a quarter-final against world No 1 Jannik Sinner.

British No 1 Draper, the fifth seed in Paris, beat Fonseca 6-2 6-4 6-2 to secure a fourth-round clash with Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik, who breezed past Portuguese qualifier Henrique Rocha 7-5 6-1 6-2.

Sinner trounced Jiri Lehecka 6-0 6-1 6-2 earlier on Saturday - the Italian is yet to drop a set in the tournament - and will next face Russian 17th seed Andrey Rublev at Roland-Garros.

If he comes through that and Draper beats Bublik, the two will meet in the last eight - nine months after Sinner defeated the Brit in the semi-finals of the US Open in New York.

Draper took command of the first set, dictating the action in their rallies and moving well across the clay court. He pounced on Fonseca's efforts to wrong foot him with drop shots, seizing those opportunities to punish the Brazilian.

He remained assured in the second set, taking advantage of Fonseca's mistakes to exert further pressure on the Brazilian teenager.

He picked the break he needed, first slicing over a pinpoint drop shot that dotted down at a tight angle then seeing Fonseca hit the net within a rally.

He staved off Fonseca's attempt to fight back as he closed out the second set and made sure to take control of the third set from the very start.

With two early breaks, Draper went 4-0 up before the young Brazilian could get a game on the board. Fonseca clawed two games back, but never threatened to overhaul the Briton.

""I played good,"" Draper said afterwards. ""The conditions were quite difficult out here. I felt like the first set was really key and then I kind of got on top of him a little bit and I felt like I used my forehand well.

""I served pretty well and mentally it was a good performance from me. The ball was getting up more and it suits me, the faster conditions. Either way I'll be ready for my next round. Happy to be in second week and hopefully more to come.""

This was Draper and Fonseca's second meeting on the ATP Tour, with Draper also winning the first - at Indian Wells in March en route to claiming the biggest title of his career to date.

Draper had never won a match at the French Open prior to this year, losing in the first round in 2023 and 2024, but is now a genuine title contender.

PARIS -- Coco Gauff got off to a terrific start in the French Open's third round Saturday, taking 12 of the first 15 points for a 3-0 lead after just 10 minutes. The rest of the opening set went smoothly, too.

Things got much tougher from there, though, and the 2023 US Open champion was merely two points from dropping the second set before getting back in the right direction and defeating Marie Bouzkova 6-1, 7-6 (3) to reach Week 2 at Roland-Garros for the fifth consecutive year.

""Obviously,"" Gauff said, ""I can do some things better.""

Gauff, a 21-year-old from Florida, was the runner-up in Paris in 2022 and is seeded No. 2 at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament this year.

Next up for her will be a matchup Monday against No. 20 Ekaterina Alexandrova, with the winner moving into the quarterfinals.

After needing just a half-hour to claim the first set Saturday, Gauff wound up in a 75-minute struggle in the second.

That set included eight breaks of serve in a row as the sounds of popping fireworks drifted over to Court Philippe Chatrier from the nearby soccer stadium belonging to Paris Saint-Germain, whose fans were gathering to attend a watch party ahead of the Champions League final against Italy's Inter Milan taking place in Munich later Saturday night.

""I served a bit more aggressive in the first set, so I was holding easier, and maybe got a little bit too passive on the serve in the second, and it allowed her to get back into the match,"" Gauff said. ""Just keeping the aggressive mindset is something that I can do better for the next match.""

The key in the second was when Gauff trailed 5-3, 30-love with Bouzkova serving. A total of four times, Bouzkova needed to string together two consecutive points to force a third set.

But Gauff wouldn't allow it, frequently stretching points with her terrific court coverage until she could find space to hit a winner. On one particularly memorable exchange, Gauff sprinted to barely reach a drop shot, scrambled into position to block back a volley, then leaped for an overhead smash.

By the end, Gauff had more than twice as many winners as Bouzkova in the second set, 22 to 11, and also helped herself by winning the point on 11 of her 14 trips to the net.

Gauff is one of five American women in the fourth round. The others are No. 3 Jessica Pegula, No. 7 Madison Keys, No. 16 Amanda Anisimova and unseeded Hailey Baptiste.

There were three U.S. men still in the bracket heading into Sunday.

Keys, who won the Australian Open in January, saved three match points while down 5-4 in the final set and came back to beat 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin 4-6, 6-3, 7-5. Keys will now play 70th-ranked Baptiste.

Anisimova meets No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka for a spot in the quarterfinals, and Pegula -- last year's US Open runner-up -- faces French wild-card entry Lois Boisson.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"

Jack Draper has reached the fourth round at the past three Grand Slams

French Open 2025

Dates: 25 May-8 June Venue: Roland Garros

Coverage: Live radio commentaries across 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and app

Britain's Jack Draper underlined his status as one of the world's leading players with a ruthlessly efficient win over Brazilian rising star Joao Fonseca in the French Open third round.

Fifth seed Draper was a cut above his 18-year-old opponent in a 6-2 6-4 6-2 victory.

Fonseca only broke into the world's top 100 earlier this year, but has created a buzz with his explosive style and ferocious forehand.

Draper quickly diffused what could have been a tricky encounter, showing his superior quality and experience from the start.

""Joao has caught the attention of the players and the fans. Today my experience came through,"" Draper said.

The 23-year-old Englishman, who had never won a match at Roland Garros until this week, will face unseeded Kazakh Alexander Bublik in the fourth round.

Later on Saturday, Cameron Norrie joined Draper in the last 16 after beating fellow Briton Jacob Fearnley in straight sets.

It marks the first time since 1963 that two British men have reached the fourth round at the clay-court Grand Slam.

Draper has developed into a top player with ambitions of challenging for the biggest titles over the past 12 months.

Possessing tools which are effective across all surfaces has seen Draper turn into a French Open contender.

Reaching the Madrid Open final was an early sign of improvement and his performances in Paris have backed that up.

Patience was needed in victories over Italy's Mattia Bellucci and French veteran Gael Monfils. It was similar against Fonseca - by biding his time in the rallies and picking attacking shots at the right time, Draper quickly gained control.

In increasingly faster conditions, the speed and spin of Draper's forehand was particularly difficult for Fonseca to handle as the Briton quickly went a double break up.

A double fault for 30-30 in the eighth game offered Fonseca faint hope, before Draper rediscovered his first serve and returned well to take the opening set in 29 minutes.

Momentum - and crowd support - started to build for Fonseca in a tighter second set, but Draper quickly extinguished hope with solid service games.

He broke for a 4-3 lead which - after saving two break points in the 10th game - was enough for a two-set lead.

Draper continued to play smartly at the start of the third set, mixing depth of return with deft drop-shots on his way to wrapping up victory.

The hype around Fonseca has continued to grow - but this was another reminder of how he still needs time to develop.

A carnival mood led by thousands of Brazilians has followed Fonseca from Melbourne to Paris this year.

Fans patiently queue to see his matches on the smaller courts at the majors, with some people setting up camp at Roland Garros hours before his first two matches.

But his clash against Draper being switched to the ticket-only Court Suzanne Lenglen late on Friday evening - after home favourite Arthur Fils withdrew from the tournament injured - worked in the Briton's favour.

While there was plenty of Brazilian support - easily identified by splashes of yellow and green national flags and Selecao football shirts - it was far from a difficult atmosphere for Draper to handle.

""How old is he, 18? Pretty impressive,"" said Draper. 

""I think it's only going to go up for him. I think it's going to be scary what he's going to be able to achieve.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","French Open Midterm Grades: Top Seeds Soar, Former No. 1 Stumbles at Roland Garros","https://www.si.com/tennis/french-open-midterm-grades-top-seeds-soar-roland-garros","Sat, 31 May 2025 17:05:41 GMT","

We talk in tennis of a transition game, moving from one set of strokes to the next, moving seamlessly up the court from one position to another. Professional tennis is undergoing a more cosmic transition game, pivoting from the Big Three/Serena Williams Era—where four bankable, historically great players each won more than 20 majors—to an era of many stars, if not quite at the same wattage.


This was thrown into relief during Week 1 at Roland Garros of 2025. The first day featured a pitch-perfect retirement ceremony for the great Rafael Nadal, the Big Three and Andy Murray—three of them in retirement—appeared in street clothes to toast the 14-time Roland Garros champ and usher in the post-Rafa Era. Then, play commenced and attention turned to active players. 


Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, No. 1 and No.2, remained committed to their bits. A spirited Brazilian contingent (is there any other kind?) made the matches of 18-year-old Joao Fonseca seem like World Cup qualifiers. Arthur Fils lent hope that there could be a homegrown men's champ for the first since the 80s. Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff and Jasmine Paolini charmed (day) crowds. Americans and Brits and an Aussie (welcome, Daria Kasatkina) remain. There are more big movers than big servers. The field is gloriously open with possibility.

As this event, also, makes the turn … herewith our 2025 French Open midterm grades:

The Turnaround artists: A week before the event Novak Djokovic and Iga Świątek had won a combined zero titles in the last 50 weeks and both, for different reasons, looked to be declining assets. Even at 38, he is doing a fine Djokovic impersonation And, rejuvenated by returning to Roland Garros she is looking like a fine bet to take another title.

The contenders: For all the action and story lines, not much in the way of upsets. Nine of the top-10 seeds remain. (And the lone loss came from a player, Taylor Fritz, who has been injured and struggling for much of the year.)


Teenage created draw wasteland: Twenty is the new … 20. The kids are back. Special commendation to Mirra Andreeva and then 18-year-old revelations Fonseca of Brazil and Victoria Mboko or Canada.


Ethan Quinn: Lone American to qualify for the main draw, former Georgia Bulldog keeps winning.


The Rafa Nadal Tribute: Like all tournaments, this one does some things right, some things not so right. This was a clean winner. The champ got the ceremony he deserved.

The Brits: After going winless in 2024, three make the third round (for the first time in 50 years) and two make Week 2.

The Yanks: The women are cruising as usual. Shoutout Hailey Baptiste. And at this writing, three men are still alive—gritty Tommy Paul, cruising Ben Shelton and resurgent Frances Tiafoe—into Week 2, first time since 1995. 


The USTA: After an encouraging week here—and a week after announcing an $800 million overhaul of Arthur Ashe Stadium—it is in search of a new  leader, as chief executive Lew Sherr leaves abruptly to take an executive position with the New York Mets.

The late-30s crowd: Stirring shotmaking and stirring nostalgia. But only Djokovic (38) remains as Gael Monfils (38), Richard Gasquet (39 this month) and Stan Wawrinka (40) all bow out. In the case of Gasquet, this marked his final Roland Garros.


Naomi Osaka: A rough draw (made possible by her lack of a seeding); an entertaining battlel signs of top-shelf, winning form; ultimately a losing result. Four-time major champ goes out to Paula Badosa.


Arthur Fils: French star—and he is a star—wins two matches. Then forced to withdraw, unable to recover from his five-set passion play. He's only 20. Lots more chances.


The night session distribution: Even if the tournament stands by its reasoning to make this a 1950s-style men's only club—through the first week, zero women's matches made the night session—simply from an optics/PR perspective, you'd think they'd come up with an equitable workaround.

Recent NCAA women's singles champs: Emma Navarro  (2021 UVA) and Peyton Stearns (2022 Texas) were both seeded here. They won a combined four games.


Daniil Medvedev: A lovely presence. Who has gone by way of Novo Nordisk stock. Out of top 10 and without a title since spring 2023, former No.1 loses in Round 1.


Courtside signage: We all understand balance sheets. But the sponsored blocks ON THE FIELD OF PLAY are an absolute menace.

BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) — Jessica Pegula has reached the fourth round of the French Open for the second time in her career.

Pegula, the No. 3 seed in the season's second Grand Slam tennis tournament, won her third match at Roland Garros on Saturday, coming back to defeat 2019 French Open finalist and 2023 Wimbledon champion Markéta Vondroušová from the Czech Republic in three sets (3-6, 6-4, 6-2).

The 31-year-old Buffalonian whose parent own the Bills and Sabres will face Lois Boisson from France on Monday for a spot in the quarterfinals.

This is the furthest Pegula has advanced at the French Open since she was a quarterfinalist in 2022. She reached the third round in 2023 and withdrew from the tournament last year due to a neck injury.

Pegula has won WTA events in Austin and Charleston this season, and reached the third round at the Australian Open. Last season she was a U.S. Open finalist, but lost in the second round of the other major tournaments she played in.

By Shrivathsa Sridhar

PARIS (Reuters) -Madison Keys sharpened up after a sluggish start to save three matchpoints and battle past Sofia Kenin 4-6 6-3 7-5 in an all-American meeting between Grand Slam champions to reach the French Open fourth round on Saturday.

Victory meant the 30-year-old Australian Open champion became the oldest woman to win 10 straight Grand Slam singles matches since Serena Williams' 16 match-winning streak between the Australian Open in 2017 and Wimbledon the following year.

“That was a great experience. It was an amazing atmosphere with so much support here,” Keys said.

“I was letting her (Kenin) dictate a bit too much so I took a few steps back on the rallies to give myself space to swing and hit and move her around on her serve.

“Yeah, it's great to see another day.”

Kenin, who reached the 2020 French Open final after winning the Australian Open that year, broke reigning Melbourne champion Keys in the seventh game and staved off a late comeback attempt from her opponent to hold for the opening set.

The world number 30 earned her only win over Keys in four previous meetings by beating her on clay in Rome six years ago and she needed all her experience on the slowest surface to remain in touch in a tight second set.

Former semi-finalist Keys pulled away, however, and levelled the match at a set apiece but quickly found herself a break down in the decider after hitting a backhand into the net.

Kenin then endured some frustrating moments on serve as she squandered a 0-3 lead before Keys saved three match points in a tense 10th game and broke again, before holding to prevail for a memorable win amid huge roars on Court Suzanne Lenglen.

Up next for Keys is another compatriot in Hailey Baptiste.

Carlos Sainz cited a myriad of problems after he was knocked out in the first stage of Qualifying for his home race at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, leaving him eager to break into the top 10 in Sunday's Grand Prix.

The Spaniard has never failed to score points around this track in his F1 career, but exiting Qualifying in P18 leaves him with the prospect of a challenging recovery drive in order to maintain his success here.

Williams have undergone a resurgence this year and regularly find themselves with at least one car in Q3, but neither Sainz nor Alex Albon were able to put together the necessary lap to progress, with the latter just missing out in P11.

One issue that Sainz experienced was an unusual kind of traffic as Franco Colapinto got stuck at the end of the pit lane towards the end of Q1, leaving the Williams in an unexpected position on the track and reduced time to improve his lap.

‘I thought we had the pace to go to Q3' – Disappointed Sainz explains how he ended up P18

“Honestly, it was a very tricky Qualifying,” Sainz said following the session. “I thought today we had the pace to go through to Q3 if we put things together, but unfortunately we were out of position after Franco [Colapinto] had a problem in the pit lane.

“We went out really late in the middle of nowhere and we had to pass five or six cars on our push lap. Had loads of dirty air which compromised my performance, and in the end when the field is so tight, I think we were one-tenth and a half from P7 – we were P18.

“We're going to try our best to make it back to the points. Tomorrow will be a good day to try something different and try and come back.

“At the same time, obviously it's Barcelona and P18 is not the best position to start, but we're going to do everything possible.”

Albon could score points for the fifth consecutive race this weekend

His team mate Alex Albon, who has only gone out in Q2 on three occasions this season, similarly suffered due to dirty air and traffic – as he referred to Ollie Bearman's Haas as “dirty” over the radio, alleging that they were “purposefully slow in Sector 3”.

It had been a tough weekend for Albon even before Qualifying began, having sat out of FP1 to allow Victor Martins to make his F1 debut and subsequently experiencing a braking issue that limited him to just five laps in FP3.

He explained: “It's a shame to miss out on Q3 but at the same time I'm really happy – that's the first time I've been through to Q2 [in Spain] with the Williams, and almost in Q3 so it shows all of us that we're going in the right direction. We still have some work to do.”

Reflecting on his radio message, Albon added: “It's fine margins. Honestly, Ollie's not in the way, I don't have to brake and I'm not getting disturbed by the object of his car, let's say. We just carry so much dirty air, and the dirty air was a bit too dirty for Sector 3 and I missed out, but that's how it is.”

When Piastri topped FP3, Q1 and Q2, it looked a tough ask for Norris to reel him in today. But on their first laps in Q3, Norris came out second and timed his out-lap beautifully to pick up a little tow from his team mate. That made all the difference as he grabbed provisional pole by a tiny margin. But with he pressure on and no tow incoming, Norris made a couple of errors on his last lap. Piastri did not, nailing his effort to grab pole by over two-tenths of a second – the biggest margin this season.

Oscar Piastri, 1st, 1:11.546

“I'm very happy with today. It's been a good weekend so far. The car's been mega today, and I feel like I've been able to put in some good laps. Thank you to the team for all the hard work. This was very different twelve months ago, so to have turned it around in the best way is a great result. We'll make sure we try to get a good start tomorrow and bring home the points.”

Lando Norris, 2nd, 1:11.755

“A decent result today. I think the pace is definitely there. We just didn't get the most out of the car on a couple of corners, but it's a good result for the team. A nice one-two, and a good place to start for tomorrow. We've got a lot of quick guys behind us, so we won't count them out, but we've got the best car underneath us. We'll do our best to bring home maximum points.”

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

""We're pleased to come away from Qualifying with a Spanish GP front-row lockout for the first time since 1998. The team have done a great job to bring a competitive car here this weekend. Both Oscar and Lando put good laps in throughout Qualifying. On Oscar's side, he executed a great lap and managed to get everything that was available from the car. On Lando's side, he just lost a bit of time on the exit of a couple of corners in Q3 but was still competitive enough to secure the front-row lockout.

“We'll work hard tonight to plan for tomorrow's race. The competition are not far behind, so we need to make sure we capitalise on these good starting positions. It should be an exciting race for the fans.”

1 / 3

Mixed fortunes in the Red Bull garage yet again. Verstappen seemed to make a step forward overnight, and while he did not have the pace for the McLarens, he did have enough speed to take the fight to Mercedes. In the end he lapped in exactly the same time as Russell, and grabbed P3 by dint of setting his lap time fractions earlier. But Tsunoda seemed to struggle all day, and exited in Q1. Not just that but he was slowest of all, despite a clean-looking last lap. A scruffy previous effort might have damaged his floor to explain his lack of pace, but he will have a tough afternoon tomorrow regardless.

Max Verstappen, 3rd, 1:11.848

“In the end, P3 was a good result for us as our first run in Q3 was a bit difficult. I couldn't find the same grip as I had before so, going into the final lap, getting our references were a bit difficult. The positive is that the car was a lot nicer to drive and in a decent window but we couldn't really extract any more out of it and match the McLarens' pace. We were just not fast enough out there: the gap to McLaren is quite big at the moment which will make things difficult to gain places tomorrow and we will just need to do our own race. Today, I didn't expect to be any closer and we did a good job putting it in P3. We will try our best tomorrow and see what we can do with the car and hopefully we can target a podium. It will be difficult but doesn't mean we won't try.""

Yuki Tsunoda, 20th, 1:13.385

“Since FP1 this weekend something has felt off, and it's a pretty tough result as we've tried everything. We've struggled with grip issues and the feeling of the car eating through the tyres all weekend. We tried to solve the issue as much as possible but I don't think we were able to cure it. We've tried multiple setups this weekend and it's strange because my lap today at the end of Q1 was pretty clean. It's a shame that there were no results today and the pace didn't match when I was feeling more confident in the car. The positive to take away is that we've built more consistency throughout the weekend and have made no big mistakes. I will try my best as always for tomorrow to bring back some points, and luckily Barcelona is a track that you can overtake on.""

Christian Horner, Team Principal

""A game of two halves during Qualifying. Congratulations to McLaren, they delivered today with both cars and locked out the front row. In practice we were circa three tenths off them and that's proved to be the case over a single lap. Now of course we have the race tomorrow which is a different challenge so hopefully we can have a strong day tomorrow. Yuki has struggled all weekend. We went up a little on the downforce to try and help him but it's difficult to understand, we will need to have a look at it. Unfortunately, he will have quite a bit to do tomorrow to make his way up the pack.""

Spain has proved a happy hunting ground for Mercedes in the past, and today was no exception. Both cars made it to Q3 – Russell with ease, Antonelli just about doing enough. Once there, the teenager only had one set of fresh tyres but put them to good use in grabbing sixth. Russell looked on for P3, but in the end had to settle for fourth as he set exactly the same time as Verstappen. That shows how tight the margins are, but with the slipstream tomorrow, Russell could be dangerous from that slot.

HIGHLIGHTS: Relive the Qualifying action as Piastri snatches pole position from Norris in Spain


George Russell, 4th, 1:11.848

""It feels good to be back near the front of the grid today and it is nice to be in this groove again after a tough Monaco Grand Prix. The car felt good today and being with the same lap time as Max (Verstappen) is not surprising. Except for Monaco, we've been in the top five every single race since the start of the season, and we know we have the pace to challenge our competitors on a Saturday.

""We do know it is still going to be a challenging race with these hot ambient temperatures and a track temperature forecast to be in the low 50°C degrees. Just like Bahrain though, we've been able to manage the tyres better when they're on the hardest end of the Pirelli spectrum. Hopefully that will be the same case tomorrow.

""The McLarens are still the dominant force this weekend and it will be a challenge to fight with them. However, a podium is what we are realistically aiming for, and I do think this is achievable tomorrow. I started P4 in this same race last year and ended up in the lead after turn one; I'll certainly try to replicate that tomorrow!""

Kimi Antonelli, 6th, 1:12.111

""After two difficult race weekends, it is good to be back in a good rhythm. It took me some time to build up my speed at the start of the session, but I started to gain a lot of confidence lap after lap.

""Unfortunately, with only one set of new Soft tyres for Q3, I was slightly limited. I wasn't able to take quite as much risk, and I know there was a couple of tenths to grab here and there, but overall, P6 is a great come back from where I had been earlier in the weekend.

""It is going to be a difficult race tomorrow with these hot temperatures. Preserving the tyres will be a real challenge for the whole field. That is why we deliberately have focused on our long run pace this weekend as we know it is an area we need to improve in. Tomorrow will be a good test of the progress we have made, and I am hopeful that we can put in a competitive showing.""

Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport

""We were back to being at the competitive end of the grid today which was encouraging. Obviously, it is a bit painful to see George starting P4 when he could have been P3 having set the same lap time as Max (Verstappen). We know that race pace is what matters around here, rather than your specific starting position, so we are looking ahead to tomorrow now. If the temperatures stay as they were today, it is going to be a difficult afternoon for everyone tomorrow. Preserving the tyres will be a struggle, as we have seen in previous hot races not only this year but around this circuit before.

""That is why we decided before the weekend to focus on improving our long run pace, given it is the main area of improvement we need to make with this car. Starting with both cars in the top six gives us the chance for a solid result. We will need to show that we have made progress with our race pace though to stand a chance of converting that promise into genuine performance. Let's see how the opening lap goes and from there, our main objective will be to preserve the tyres lap after lap and still ensure we can post competitive lap times.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""We could have done a little better than P4 and P6 today, which is frustrating. George matched Max's (Verstappen) lap time to the thousandth and wasn't far behind Lando (Norris), but the smallest of differences still count. Kimi had to use more sets of the Soft tyre than was ideal on his way to Q3. That left him with just one new tyre set, and it was hard to judge the grip step on a cooling track. He felt he left a bit of lap time on the table but it was still a good effort to split the Ferraris.

""The race is going to be tough on the tyres tomorrow. It's really hot here in Barcelona and that's going to make it hard to keep temperatures under control. We have done plenty of high fuel work in free practice though, so hopefully both drivers will be as well prepared as possible. It is an area we need to improve in, so tomorrow's race will offer a good test of the progress we've hopefully made.""

Hamilton complained about his gearbox in FP3, but whatever the team did between the sessions worked and he was competitive throughout. They did get both cars into Q3 which was a good first step, but Leclerc didn't have any fresh tyres left so only ran the once. Hamilton was able to have two goes, his second quick enough for fifth - which was a good effort considering how unhappy he was with his car yesterday.

Charles Leclerc, 7th, 1:12.131

""I knew it would be a difficult qualifying. We only had 4 new sets of Softs for this qualifying session compared to others who had 5, but we made that choice and I think we can put up a good fight starting from P7 tomorrow. Our race pace looks good and we have a different selection of tyres available to us compared to those starting around us, so we will see if our decision pays off.""

Lewis Hamilton, 5th, 1:12.045

""FP3 wasn't ideal, but P5 in quali shows the progress we've made since the start of the triple-header. The car felt good, so I'm going all in tomorrow, aiming for a podium finish. The field's tight, just a few tenths between the top ten, so it's going to be a proper fight. There's still work to do tonight, but we'll stay focused and make sure we're ready for the race.""

Fred Vasseur, Team Principal

""From the start of the weekend, we made a strategic decision with Charles to prioritise the race, choosing to keep two sets of Medium tyres and today we also opted to keep one set of Softs for the race that had only done an out-in lap, so we decided to sacrifice some performance in qualifying. As for his actual grid position, it's probable he wasn't helped by the clouds that appeared at the very end of the session. We believe this decision will pay off in the race given the expected high temperatures and high tyre degradation.

""As for Lewis, I think qualifying went pretty well for him, even if we had to use two sets of Softs early in the session. He put together a good lap in Q2, immediately making the cut and his Q3 was solid so we can expect a good race from him.""

Colapinto cannot buy any luck right now. He was faster than his team mate on their first runs in Q1, but as he came out for his last run his car ceased working. That left him parked in the fast lane of the pits, with the rest of the field forced to drive around him. Alpine will be hard at work diagnosing the issue overnight, but no matter what they find, he starts down the back. Gasly at least gave the team something to cheer about with P8, as he chases a first Grand prix top 10 since Bahrain.

FACTS AND STATS: A first front row lock-out in Spain for McLaren since 1998 as Piastri grabs biggest pole margin of the season


Pierre Gasly, 8th, 1:12.199

“I am happy with the Qualifying performance. We definitely needed that after a frustrating couple of weeks and it was important for us to bounce back and be top of the midfield. The top four teams certainly have an edge so to be in that position today is good and I am happy for everyone at the team. We tried some things in Free Practice 3 but reverted back on our set-up ahead of Qualifying. We executed three good sessions and, in the end, reached Q3, put in a really solid lap, and line up eighth place on the grid for tomorrow. We have given ourselves a chance to fight for points now but we know it will be a different story with strategy and tyre degradation. Let's see how it goes and I am pleased to be in the mix. Now I am going to enjoy the Champions League Final tonight and aim to come back tomorrow morning with a smile and ready to race.”

Franco Colapinto, 19th, 1:13.334

“After how the car was feeling during the first runs in Q1, it is a pity we did not have a chance to attempt a final push lap and give ourselves a chance to progress. It felt like something broke on the car, which meant I could not pull away in the queue in the Pit Lane. Overall, the pace of the car felt good in that session and was the best it has felt all weekend, which is testament to the work the team has done to turn it around from where we were yesterday. From where we are starting, we need to look at what is possible with the strategy as it is quite difficult to overtake here at this track. Today was a tough one to take given how the car felt. But it sometimes happens, and we go through those highs and lows as a team and will look to bounce back tomorrow.”

Flavio Briatore, Executive Advisor

“It was a much better performance in Qualifying from where we were across the weekend with the drivers much happier with the balance of the car. The team worked hard after the practice sessions and made improvements, which showed by getting one car into Q3 with Pierre doing a good job. Franco was also looking more comfortable and showing good pace until the issue in the Pit Lane that prevented him from doing a final lap. It is always disappointing when there is an issue that stops you going out on track, so we need to get the car back and check what caused it to make sure we address it as a team.”

With both cars in the top 10 in final practice, hopes were high of a strong Qualifying for Racing Bulls. In the end Hadjar delivered another Q3 slot, but could only run once as he had run out of fresh tyres. Ninth was still a good effort, while Lawson had to settle for P13 with the gaps incredibly tight out there. He'll hope to move forward tomorrow, in what should be a two-stop race.

Isack Hadjar, 9th, 1:12.252

""I'm really happy with today's result. It feels great to make it into Q3 again, that was almost the best we could have hoped for. At one point, we were worried we might not even make it out of Q1, so we can be proud of the job we did. The car felt good and kept improving with every lap. We made the right changes at the right time, and everything came together perfectly. Things are looking promising for tomorrow. I'm confident heading into the race, it will come down to true pace and managing either a one or two-stop strategy. If we nail the start, we'll be in the fight for points.”

Liam Lawson, 13th, 1:12.763

""It was a good start to Quali. We were always chasing balance throughout the session, but the speed was strong. The car felt really good and I thought we had a great final lap in Q2, so we'll be reviewing it as a team ahead of tomorrow, particularly given this was the first time the car lacked speed during the weekend. There are opportunities for overtaking here, so as always we'll be pushing for points.”

Andrea Landi, Deputy Technical Director - Design

“Barcelona is a great track, it is the first real moment during the season where we get important answers on car performance, with the Qualifying session bringing most of those answers. Here everything counts, downforce, drag, efficiency, balance, wind sensitivity; tyres have hard life here around too, so all in all, an extremely interesting day. After Friday's running, the Team here in Barcelona, together with support from home, could analyse data and prepare some more test items for today, which proved to give good refinement to an already reasonable baseline. Our day was good, achieving Q3 with Isaak in P9, missing P8 by only 50ms. Liam performed well but struggled to put it all together and given the tight field, didn't quite manage to reach the last Quali session. Tomorrow will be a long race, with tyre management being a key element for success.""

Alonso looked strong from the off on Saturday, and made it to Q3 yet again. He came out midway through the segment, opting for clean air over track evolution and wound up 10th as he chases his first points of the year. Stroll exited in Q2, not quite on his team mate's pace here so far this weekend. He was also called to the stewards to explain why he missed being weighed at the end of Q2.

Fernando Alonso, 10th, 1:12.284

""It's been a good weekend so far, and getting into Q3 shows we are in the fight for points. It's the third consecutive Q3 for us so I'm pleased with that.

""We've made some progress since Miami where we were fighting at the back and Barcelona is always a true test. It shows our update package has given us a step forward.

""Hopefully we can finish the job tomorrow, especially here at home in front of this amazing support.""

Lance Stroll, 14th, 1:13.058

""It's been a tough weekend for us so far – the car hasn't been easy to handle all weekend and it's been challenging to put clean laps together. Nevertheless, we made it through to Q2 and we take any small wins we can get at the moment.

""We have lots of areas of the car that we need to look into and improve, but we'll see what we can do tomorrow starting from P14.""

Andy Cowell, Team Principal

""It was a mixed Qualifying session for us today. Fernando left nothing out there in front of his home crowd putting in strong laps every session and he worked exceptionally hard to get everything out of the car.

""Lance put in a good Q1 lap but has been struggling to find balance in the car so far this weekend and that is something the team has to improve going forward. The grid is very tight, and we will work hard tomorrow to be in the points.""

Williams did not expect this track to suit them, but the aim was to get one car into Q3. That they did not manage, Albon coming the closest with P11. But Sainz had an even harder time of it, exiting in Q1 for the first time in 18 months and at his home race to boot. He'll be hoping their race pace is stronger than their one-lap pace, but it remains to be seen how much progress he can make as he aims to keep his points-scoring streak on home soil alive.

Alex Albon, 11th, 1:12.641

""The margins are so small but Q3 was there for the taking today. I had very limited low-fuel running due to missing FP1, and after having an issue in FP3, we went into this session compromised. Barcelona exposes some of the weaknesses in the DNA of this car, so all things considered, I think this is a good result at a track that's challenging for us.""

Carlos Sainz, 18th, 1:13.203

""Very disappointing day. After our struggles yesterday we made some good changes overnight that put us in contention for a good result. Unfortunately, the delay in the pit lane due to an issue of the Alpine meant I was out of position for my second push in Q1 and had to overtake five or six cars during my lap. With such a tight field, having that amount of dirty air made me lose valuable tenths and that put a premature ending to my session in Q1, which is not good.

""I'll do my best to fight through the field tomorrow and give my home crowd something to cheer for. Let's see what we can do.""

James Vowles, Team Principal

""A really close grid. Between Carlos and getting through to Q2 was a matter of milliseconds and with Alex, I know we had more potential in the car. We lost a little bit of time with traffic, both cars at the end of sector three, which ultimately decided our day.

""However, I'm encouraged. Despite where we were, we knew this was a difficult track for us, but actually across the weekend, we found good progress on how to move forward and there's more learning to come tomorrow. This learning will enable us to be strong not just at future tracks in 2025, but also as we develop our 2026 car.""

Bortoleto has looked competitive here, and seemed comfortable with his car and at this track. So much so, he beat his team mate over one lap for the third time in the last four races – no mean feat considering Hulkenberg's one lap prowess. In the end, the rookie settled for P12, a career-best Qualifying as he chases his first F1 points. Hulkenberg was a few places further back after exiting in Q1.

EXPLAINED: Everything you need to know about the Spanish Grand Prix front wing Technical Directive


Nico Hulkenberg, 16th, 1:13.190

“We definitely had the potential to progress today, but unfortunately, my final lap wasn't as clean as it could've been. I picked up quite a bit of understeer in the last sector, which cost me around two tenths—and in such a tight Q1, that made all the difference.

“That said, the upgrades we brought this weekend have clearly delivered a step forward. Right from the first lap, I had a much better feeling in the car. The handling felt more consistent, and the overall balance has improved—that's definitely encouraging. Looking ahead to tomorrow, starting from P16 means we'll have to deal with traffic, which is always a challenge on a fast, flowing circuit like this. It won't be easy, but we'll regroup tonight and explore all strategic options to move forward.”

Gabriel Bortoleto, 12th, 1:12.756

“I'm very happy with how qualifying went today—this has been the best result so far for me this season, and a very solid day overall. The upgrades we brought this weekend seem to be working, which is definitely encouraging: the team deserves it, as everyone has been working very hard. I'm glad that we are moving towards the right direction now, and that we have been able to show our potential today, but I'm also well aware that this is just Saturday: the main job is done tomorrow. I think tomorrow's race is going to be a lot about tyre management, so it'll be crucial to make the right calls and hopefully make a further step forward.”

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal

“Coming out of FP3 today, the big positive was that both drivers seemed happy with the upgrades, so I would like to thank everyone in Hinwil for all the hard work in getting them onto both cars. On a circuit as aero-dependent as Barcelona, that extra confidence—especially in the braking zones—makes a real difference. In qualifying, following a small mistake in the last sector, Nico missed out on Q2 by just 0.051 seconds. So, P16 doesn't reflect the fact that he was capable of making it through. Gabriel progressed to Q2 with a solid P10, then delivered two really clean laps to finish P12, just shy of making it into Q3. This equals our best race qualifying of the season and also marks Gabriel's best qualifying result in Formula One so far. Our focus for tomorrow's race is to be in the mix for points.”

Haas were struggling in FP3, so it was no surprise to see them lose a car in Q1. In the end it was Ocon who exited, perhaps still paying the price for sitting out FP1 and losing some track time here. Bearman was forced to use all his tyres to make it out of Q1, and thus only had used rubber to run in Q2. He wound up 15th on what was a bit of a tricky day for the team.

Esteban Ocon, 17th, 1:13.201

“It was close out there, just a tenth would've got me into Q2. It's far from over this weekend though, it's a long race, you need to look after your tyres, and there's going to be a lot of pit stop strategies. There's a long way to go and hopefully, we can optimize things and move forward.”

Oliver Bearman, 15th, 1:13.315

“We used all of our new tyres to get into Q2, and we managed that which is positive. We were probably faster than we expected, so I think if I had a new set in Q2 we would've been challenging to get into Q3 potentially. That's a shame, but prior to the session I think we were quite clearly lacking performance to be where we just qualified, so I think we can be positive about that. It's so hot here, I think it's definitely going to change the way that we do things and I don't know how the strategy will go, but we'll try and have a good one tomorrow.”

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“The good thing was that we improved the car quite a lot from FP3. The team has worked really hard from FP1 – of course, we need to figure out why it took so long to improve the car – but the car was performing reasonably well. The sad thing was that because we got there late, we used three sets of soft tyres to get out of Q1. Ollie did a very good job to get out of Q1 in P12, so that was definitely better than expected, but then we had no new tyres for Q2. Everything has a knock-on impact but the car and its ultimate potential, I think it's close to Q3 today and if Ollie had a new tyre, he would've been fighting for Q3. The other positive for tomorrow is that we have decent race tyres, all compounds available to us, so we have pretty good options to choose from, so that's our focus for tonight now that we've improved the car.”

1 / 2

Mario Isola, Motorsport Director

“The Barcelona-Catalunya track is always a severe test for car and tyre performance. Today we saw one team yet again monopolising the top two spots on the timesheets, but behind them, it's very tight, and I expect the race will reflect that. It will be fascinating to see how the teams approach a race that always puts significant stress on the tyres. A two-stop strategy is almost obligatory, and I reckon the Medium and Soft compounds will see most of the action. We saw yesterday that the Hard tyre tends to slide too much and the lap times compared to those on the softer compounds reflect that.

“On paper, the Soft-Medium-Soft strategy is fastest, as was the case last year. Three drivers, Ferrari's Leclerc and the Haas drivers Ocon and Bearman, have saved two sets of Mediums, clearly aiming to use them in the race. For those starting on Softs to make the most of the extra grip early on, with some drivers having new sets of the C3, the first stint should extend to at least lap 12. Then, based on simulations, they'll aim to stretch the second stint to around lap 40, finishing with a final Soft stint. With a lighter car, that last set should be enough to get to lap 66. Drivers aiming for a more balanced race and planning to use the second set of Mediums will likely stop a few laps earlier. It's also worth noting that undercuts are particularly powerful on this track.

“As for the performance of the C3 in qualifying, we saw its worth over a flying lap, as had already been evident in the three free practice sessions. The sudden seven degree drop in temperature in Q3, definitely saw the track get quicker, which paid off for those who had chosen to delay their last run as much as possible.”

Yuki Tsunoda was left searching for answers after ending Qualifying for the Spanish Grand Prix down in 20th and last place, with the Japanese driver admitting that he realistically is “a bit less hopeful” about his prospects for race day.

It had been a tricky start to the weekend in Barcelona for Tsunoda during Friday's practice sessions as he remained some way off the pace of team mate Max Verstappen across FP1 and FP2, taking P9 and P13 in those sessions respectively.

After admitting that he was “struggling”, the 25-year-old's fortunes did not improve come Saturday, with the #22 car exiting Qualifying in Q1 meaning that he will line up on the back row of the grid for Sunday's race.

Tsunoda faced a difficult Qualifying in Spain at the wheel of the RB21, with the Japanese driver exiting Q1 in P20

“It's pretty tough,” Tsunoda said of his session. “Throughout the week we… I tried to solve the issue as much as possible. I was mentioning from FP1 that I had some strange issue that [the car] was just not gripping at all.

“We tried our best to solve the issue but I don't think we [were] able to cure it. Whatever we made in terms of set-up change, it's always a kind of cluster feeling and it's not really giving an overall step forwards.

“It's a shame, honestly the lap itself was okay. There's not much [where] I had a mistake or whatever in both laps. Even probably if we put the three sets [of tyres on], I don't think I would have been able to… With that pace, it's going to be tough.”

Tsunoda looking for answers after he is slowest in Qualifying

Pushed on how he will reset for the 66-lap encounter on Sunday, Tsunoda suggested that there could be other issues at play for the race.

“The thing is it also applies to the long-run pace as well,” he explained. “[In] FP2, the long-run pace was really bad.

“It just isn't a good feeling, so far what I feel is the car is eating its tyres a lot, and every lap whatever I do I have the degradation. But, anyway, hopefully the set-up change made a step forward. I'm hoping it will be better, but realistically I'm a little bit less hopeful.”

Disney's instant blockbuster 'Lilo & Stitch' is eyeing a second-weekend domestic haul of $60 million-plus, while Tom Cruise's final 'M:I' movie sits safely at No. 2 after zooming past $100 million on Friday.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	While its fate isn't yet sealed, there's a good chance the multiverse-minded Karate Kid: Legends will open behind expectations at the domestic box office, despite teaming original star Ralph Macchio and beloved action legend Jackie Chan, who starred in the 2010 redux.


	Sony is predicting a third-place opening for the male-fueled film in the $21 million to $23 million range (rival studios show the movie coming in closer to $19 million). Heading into the weekend, tracking had it at $25 million; three weeks ago, that number was a far more promising $35 million). Regardless of where it lands, Sony remains confident that the PG-13 film will sport strong chops, thanks to an A- CinemaScore and solid exits. And its net production budget was a modest $45 million before marketing.

					Ralph Macchio Insisted That 'Karate Kid: Legends' Delay Its Release Until After 'Cobra Kai'		
			









	Critics are far more divided than audiences when it comes to Karate Kid: Legends, which features Ben Wang in the titular role. His character is mentored by both the characters played by Macchio, star of the classic 1984 movie and, far more recently, Netflix's acclaimed Cobra Kai series, which ran for six seasons and ended earlier this year.


	In 2010, Sony successfully reinvigorated the franchise with The Karate Kid, starring Chan opposite Jaden Smith. The movie, opening to $55 million domestically, was one of the year's top hits. 


	Box office pundits are already speculating that franchise fans may have stated by Cobra Kai, at least for the time being. The series was viewed as a sequel to the first three films; the threequel was released in 1989. They add that middling reviews for Legends certainly aren't helping.


	And then there's the Lilo & Stitch and Mission: Impossible factor. Both movies continue to do strong business after serving up a record Memorial Day weekend at the box office.

	











	The bounty was led by Disney's Lilo & Stitch, which exceeded all expectations in opening to nearly $183 million domestically and shattering numerous records. The film, which easily remains No. 1 by leaps and bounds, is expected to earn $60 million or more this weekend, one of the best sophomore showings ever for a Disney live-action redo. Lilo should finish Sunday with a massive domestic haul of $280 million.


	Paramount and Skydance's Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning, starring Tom Cruise in his final turn as uber spy Ethan Hunt, is firmly seated in second place with an estimated sophomore outing of $28 million for a domestic tally of $122 million. It crossed $100 million on Friday in only its eighth day in release after opening to a franchise-best $79 million over the long holiday weekend.


Karate Kid isn't the only new nationwide offering. A24's highly anticipated thriller Bring Her Back, starring Sally Hawkings, is headed for a pleasing fifth-place finish with $6.5 million-$8 million.


	At the specialty box office, Wes Anderson's The Phoenician Scheme is opening in six locations and is on course to score the top per-location average of the year following the film's debut at the Cannes Film Festival. Focus Features and Indian Paintbrush partnered on the film.

""Yes you did that Tay!!!"" the singer and actress wrote.

Selena Gomez is celebrating her longtime friend Taylor Swift's latest victory.


	On Friday (May 30), the Rare Beauty founder showed her support for Swift after the pop superstar revealed she had officially purchased back the masters to her first six albums.


	“YES YOU DID THAT TAY!!!” Gomez wrote in all caps on her Instagram Story. “SO proud!”


	Swift made the announcement earlier in the day by posting photos of herself with the covers of her first six albums on Instagram, directing fans to a heartfelt letter on her website. In the lengthy message, the 14-time Grammy winner reflected on the emotional journey of reclaiming her music.




			Trending on Billboard		







	 “To say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it,” she wrote. “To my fans, you know how important this has been to me — so much so that I meticulously re-recorded and released four of my albums, calling them Taylor's Version.”

	











	“The passionate support you showed those albums and the success story you turned The Eras Tour into is why I was able to buy back my music,” the singer added. “I can't thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now.”

	











	Swift acquired the masters from private equity firm Shamrock Capital for somewhere around $360 million, sources tell Billboard. The sale comes six years after Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings purchased her catalog from Big Machine's Scott Borchetta in 2019, later selling his ownership of Swift's music to Shamrock in late 2020.


	Of the pop superstar's purchase, Braun tells Billboard, “I am happy for her.”


	Gomez and Swift's friendship spans nearly two decades. The two first met in 2008 through the Jonas Brothers — Swift was dating Joe at the time, while Gomez was linked to Nick. Since then, they've remained close, consistently supporting each other through the many highs and lows of their personal lives and careers. Check out a full timeline of their longtime friendship here.

As country music fans descend upon Nashville for CMA Fest 2025 from June 5 – 8, they'll get to celebrate country music queen Reba McEntire's epic career in a new spot called The Reba House. According to a press release from her record label, the temporary space will be filled to the brim with memorabilia celebrating McEntire's career, including her iconic chair from “The Voice” set. 

Although McEntire is not scheduled to perform this year at CMA Fest, fans will get to immerse themselves in all aspects of her decades-long career and be the first fans to pre-order her upcoming “The Hits” album, due in October. 

A post shared by Academy of Country Music (ACM) (@acmawards)

In addition to trying out McEntire's iconic red chair from “The Voice,” where she'll return as a coach for season 28, the new Reba House will also feature a replica of the tavern on her hit NBC sitcom, “Happy's Place” and a Realtor.com photobooth where visitors can get a “keepsake pic in a fan-favorite scene.”

Memorabilia inside The Reba House will include a curated collection of outfits from McEntire's concert wardrobes, including the iconic red dress she performed in at the 1993 Country Music Awards and years later at the 2018 Academy of Country Music Awards while singing a duet with Kelly Clarkson.

According to MCA, merchandise displays inside The Reba House will offer fans a look at her collectible Funko Pop! figure, a Dillard's Showcase of clothes from McEntire's fashion line, pairs of her REBA by Justin boots, and her bestselling book “Not That Fancy.”

The new Reba House, located at Fan Fair X in Music City Center, will be open each day of CMA Fest from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. 

Fans who visit The Reba House will also be able to pre-order McEntire's upcoming album “The Hits” on exclusive vinyl and get an exclusive Reba poster. Slated for an October 31 release, “The Hits” will be the “first-ever, career-spanning collection of McEntire's most beloved songs,” per MCA. 

Side one of the new album will feature her hits “Can't Even Get The Blues No More,” “Somebody Should Leave,” “Whoever's In New England,” “Does He Love You (with Linda Davis),” “Is There Life Out There,” “Consider Me Gone,” and “Turn On The Radio.” 

Side two's track list features “Why Haven't I Heard From You,” “The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia,” “For My Broken Heart,” “I'm A Survivor,” “Back To God,” and “Fancy.” 

Meanwhile, McEntire's new hit song with Miranda Lambert and Lainey Wilson, “Trailblazer,” is available everywhere music can be streamed. The trio debuted the song at the CMAs on May 9 and gave a surprise performance of the tune during McEntire's May 30 set at the Nashville Rodeo.

“On August 4, I will be back and I am pissed off.”

So said Mike Judge as the voice of Hank Hill to close Friday's “King of the Hill” reunion and revival panel at the ATX Television Festival. Fans packed a sold-out Paramount Theater in Austin, TX to celebrate the first 13 seasons of the Fox animated comedy and get an exclusive preview of Season 14, straight from the series' co-creators Judge and Greg Daniels, executive producer and new showrunner Saladin K. Patterson, and members of the voice cast Pamela Adlon (who won an Emmy for portraying Bobby Hill), Lauren Tom (who voices Minh and Connie Souphanousinphone), and Toby Huss (who voiced Kahn Souphanousinphone and Cotton Hill in the original run and will replace the late Johnny Hardwicke as Dale Gribble in the revival).

In addition to a teaser that updates the original credits (which you can watch below), attendees were treated to a clip of Hank and Peggy returning to Texas after spending several years working in Saudi Arabia, as well as a longer teaser with plenty of scenes featuring a now 21-year-old Bobby. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“Where it clicked for me was when we started talking about aging the characters,” Judge said about deciding to seriously pursue a new season. “Because it's such a grounded realistic show, it just felt right that they would be older.”

In Season 14, Hank and Peggy are now retired and have just moved back to Texas. Bobby is working as a successful sushi chef in Dallas — the news of which elicited a chorus of boos from the loyal Austin crowd. Worse still, it's a “German sushi robata” restaurant, which means Bobby is using charcoal, not propane, to grill his food. Given Hank's lifelong devotion to liquified petroleum gas, the gasps from the gathered fans were well-warranted. 

“You didn't see that one coming did you?” Huss said, prodding the audience.

“As an adult, he's become more centered and almost a little bit more like his dad,” Adlon said.

Tom revealed that Connie is practicing ENM — “ethical non-monogamy” — while Daniels reported that Hank taking a new job overseas was pretty hard on his friend Bill (voiced by Stephen Root). “I think I finished Netflix,” Daniels said, quoting the character's reaction to Hank's return.

Hank, meanwhile, has mixed feelings about being back in America. Although the initial clip showed him so thankful to be in Texas that he drops to his knees and kisses the ground, what's waiting for him isn't the same Arlin he left behind. 

 










“Hank kinda liked that women were covered up and modest [in Saudi Arabia],” Judge said. “He comes back and there's a bike lane and a scooter lane. […] He's looking at all the stuff that's happened in the last 15 years, and there's a whole world of things that would annoy Hank.”

“Peggy is a character who feels she can do anything, and now she has the free time to do it,” Patterson said. “So we get to see Peggy try some new things to see what post-retirement life looks like for her. But at the end of the day, this is still going to be about their relationship, supporting each other and encouraging each other. We just have a little fun with their neuroses.”

With Dale Gribble, original voice actor Johnny Hardwicke recorded six episodes before his death in 2023. Huss will take over the role for the rest of the run.

“That you guys trusted me to do his voice again is really humbling,” Huss said. “I'm not trying to copy Johnny as much as I'm trying to be Johnny and hope Dale comes out of that. … All I'm trying to do is hold onto that Daleness. We love our Johnny, and we're so sad he's not here.”

Regarding any changes to the character himself, Huss hinted at another major pivot for a man known for taking big swings.

“Dale's back doing his thing, man,” Huss said. “Dale now is a little bit left of right, where he used to be all the way right. Now he's been out-righted by the right with the conspiracy theory stuff. We'll see how Dale reacts to the new world. We'll see what he can do.”

 










“King of the Hill” originally ran from 1997 – 2009, spanning 13 seasons and 259 episodes — all of which are available on Hulu. The new season will premiere August 4 with 10 episodes. Watch the teaser below.

							By 

	Andy Greene




F
orty-one years ago, Ralph Macchio landed the role of a bullied high school student who learns karate from his apartment building's handyman in The Karate Kid. Few people involved with the movie thought they were creating a mega-blockbuster, but it wound up grossing an astounding $130.8 million on a mere $8 million budget. It was followed by two sequels starring Macchio, and a fourth film where Hilary Swank became The Next Karate Kid.


	In 2018, Karate Kid superfans Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg convinced Macchio to put the gi back on for the Netflix series Cobra Kai, which moved the story into the next generation, while still chronicling the lives of the surviving characters from the original films. Once again, the project wildly surpassed expectations, running for six seasons and racking up near-record audience numbers on the streamer.


Cobra Kai has been off the air for only a matter of months, but this week, Macchio returned as Daniel LaRusso once again: In the new theatrical movie Karate Kid: Legends, he's paired with Jackie Chan's Mr. Han character from the 2010 Karate Kid remake.

	











	It could easily frustrate an actor to be so closely associated with a single character, particularly one they've been playing for decades, but Macchio, 63, has come to terms with it. “I don't want to call it a double-edged sword, but it's made things challenging, certainly,” he tells Rolling Stone via Zoom from his home in California. “No matter how many times you want to shout out My Cousin Vinny or The Outsiders, it's Karate Kid that people bring up.” Still he adds, “It sounds lame, but that character and the franchise brings joy to kids from six to 86. In this world, if that's my footprint, it could be worse.”

	











	For Rolling Stone‘s Last Word column, Macchio talked about the pitfalls of child stardom, managing the slow times in his career, the prospects of a Cobra Kai movie, and more.


What are the best and worst parts of success?The best part is getting a chance to pay a little bit of it forward. I enjoy sharing with the next generation a piece of the gift that I was given, because I got pretty lucky. When talking with the young actors on Cobra Kai, along with my kids and their friends, they kind of lean in and they want to hear these stories. They're usually positive stories, and I feel like I'm passing on some positivity in a world that honestly is not always so positive.

	The worst part is that you're under a microscope anywhere you go. You have to stay home to have the “off” switch. Also, when you lose success, you put so much pressure on yourself to have it again. And that's probably the worst part, the amount of pressure you put on yourself.


What music moves you the most?I'm on this Roy Orbison tear right now, just his voice, that music, those songs… I have just gone down that rabbit hole of his music. And Springsteen never gets old for me.


Do you have a favorite Springsteen song?I'm not really original here since everyone love this song, but “Thunder Road.” It's very cinematic. And I also love “Long Walk Home” right now. His music just speaks to you at different stages of your life. And obviously, I'm into Coldplay now since I got to do that music video with them. That was a really cool moment.


You've been with your wife for nearly 40 years. That's about 400 years in Hollywood time. What's the secret to a long marriage?For me, our relationship always felt right and instinctively magical from the get-go. That's because she was way out of my league. I was punching way up a couple of weight classes. And then for a long-term relationship, you need to have a foundation that's always there. It's about working together for what you believe is meant to be. And there are plenty of times where it doesn't feel all right, and that's part of the journey. The work and the sensibilities of myself and Phyllis, my wife, are… I don't want to use the term stick-to-itiveness because that is kind of a chintzy word, but you have to sometimes tuck that football in and keep your eye on the prize, even through the turbulent times, because you know the prize is great.

You've always looked at least 10 years younger than you actually are. How much of that is living well and how much of that is genetic?It's mainly genes, but I am healthy and I do live well. I don't smoke. I'm not a drug user, besides alcohol when I want to have a drink or some wine. I'm a big fan of great wine. So, it's my parents' fault. I blame them. They screwed it up. They made this happen. But it's getting tough. I like being a little bit further away from the camera these days. When they send in pictures and they say, “This is the shot we'd like to use. We'll clean up Ralph's neck. We'll take those lines out in that droopy part” — that's all new now. That's happening more, but I guess we call it the Macchio curve. I get to wait a little bit longer before that stuff happens. 

	











What's the most indulgent purchase you've ever made?Right after The Outsiders, before The Karate Kid, I had just enough to buy the biggest Mercedes that there was. It was like the 560 SEL 1983 or whatever this was. It was a big black Mercedes. I mean, it must've looked like a little kid driving his father's Cadillac. I don't know why. I just wanted that. It was like your rich uncle's car. At the time, it was $55,000.


You avoided this curse, but why do you think so many child stars turned to drugs when they got older?There's a void when fame disappears, when you have it and you lose it. When you wave to that guard on the movie lot and he just says, “Hi,” and then you come back two years later, and they ask to see your license and make you wait. That plays on certain people, especially when you're young.


	But this is not to say that I didn't have times where I might not have been the most pleasant guy to be around, even for my wife and my family, because I was a little rudderless. I was like, “What am I going to do?” 


You didn't work a ton in the Nineties and early 2000s. What filled your time?Some of that was starting my family. My daughter was born '92, my son was born '95. So, I was kind of around for all that, for the most part. I would pop out to L.A. or New York, do some theater, do a few guest spots in television shows or whatever, indie movie here or there.


	There were times I was frustrated with my career. When I look at it now, it's like I designed it perfectly. I got to be there [with my kids]. I had the big rush at the beginning. I got to be a dad and not be an absent person, and a husband, for that matter. And now to watch them witness all this, what's going on now with Cobra Kai, and see them champion me and cheer it on, it's an embarrassment of riches in a way.


What's your best advice to an actor in the middle of a dry spell?Stay creative. You can always be creative, if that's part of what's missing. If the fame part and being successful is what's missing, then maybe you're in the wrong deal, because none of that's in your control. Your creativity is in some of your control, because you could venture out and try and take risks. Whether you can make a living at it or not is a whole other story, and that's really the challenge.


You did Dancing With the Stars. Did that lead to offers for more reality shows you turned down?Yes. And I passed on Dancing With the Stars numerous times before that. It was just the right time to do it, and it turned out well for me. But yes, then you become in that pool of, I'm a Celebrity, Kick Me Off a Running Train, or Fear Factor: Celebrity Africa or whatever. So, I've got plenty of those Masked Singer offers. I understand the success of that show. It's just not of interest to me right now.

	











	But the one thing Dancing With the Stars does, and I think it gives the credit to that show, is it's not train-wreck TV. They really want people to do well. You look at The Karate Kid, it's the underdog story, and that's what kind of worked for me. I was sort of a parallel of that guy. I had the fans kind of embracing the older version of this kid.


What's the biggest difference between Eighties fame and 2020s fame?There was a lot more drugs in your face then. I was too afraid to get near it, but it was all over the place. I was around it all the time. You also had a little bit of time if something went wrong back then. Now, you have no time. Something goes wrong, it's out there. It's just in your feed, people are taunting you. It's super-challenging. I don't know how these young actors and young famous people deal with it. But on the flip side to that, they also can make themselves famous from it without having done anything, really.


Cobra Kai was basically the biggest show on Netflix for years. How were you processing that after all these years out of the limelight?Sometimes I use the word “stupid.” This is just stupid how successful this is, but that's really underselling it. I think a lot of credit goes to the original filmmakers back in '84 and the writer, Robert Mark Kamen, who created the story and these characters and that Mr. Miyagi, human Yoda, that was that kind of secret sauce of the whole franchise. And then Jon, Josh, and Hayden who write this show and care so much. They flipped the script on characters and brought in new ones coming from different angles. 


	I remember an executive said, “Congratulations on Cobra Kai. Everything old is new again.” And I responded, “You know what? It's always been there. It's always been the new nostalgia, in a way.” But it is blessed from somewhere above, because it really has had such a warm embrace from what is now close to four generations that were waiting for the big finale, which really lands.


Is any part of this a little bittersweet since Pat Morita isn't here to see it?A little bit, but I feel confident in saying I've done him and our partnership well. I feel strongly about that in the show, and hopefully what we'll see with the Karate Kid: Legends movie coming. I'm always wanting to protect the honesty of that partnership, which to me is the magic of The Karate Kid. Without Miyagi, there is no… We're not doing any of this.


A lot of fans were expecting to see Hilary Swank revive her character from The Next Karate Kid in the last season. Did they try to get her on?Yeah, they tried to. There's nothing Jon, Josh, and Hayden did not try to check every box, and they checked almost every single box. I think they connected with her, but I think she just didn't want to do it for whatever the reason. It just didn't make sense for whatever was going on in her life at that time. And I wasn't deep into any of those conversations, I just knew they took a stab at getting her on. They had one version of the story with her, and another version without her.

	











I presume she would have resolved the story about Miyagi and the stolen necklace.Yeah. That was the intention.


I really loved the Cobra Kai finale. The scene that struck me the most was the final confrontation between Johnny and Kreese in the parking lot. Billy [Zabka, who plays Johnny] deserves an Emmy for that.Yeah, he really went for it. It was shot two days after my scene [with the CGI Pat Morita]. I said, “Hi, did my ‘Cobra Cry' scene, how was yours?” He goes, “I think I nailed it.” He felt really good about it. And it's great because you're following his character the whole way, and he does a terrific job in the show.


Wrapping up the storylines of so many characters must have been tough.That's part of the challenge. And it was nice for them to have the 15 episodes to be able to do that. The most emotional scene to me is with Daniel and Samantha, the goodbye scene where she's heading off to Okinawa. The Daniel and Samantha relationship from the first episode of the show has been at the heart of depth for my character and her. So, that was really moving to me.


Do you think the original Karate Kid would get a green light by a Hollywood studio today?It probably would've been on the Family Channel or a faith-based network. It could maybe have been a Little Miss Sunshine-like Fox Searchlight movie. You'd like to believe it can cut through, because the story worked so well. But on paper, it's another time, man, it's really hard.


When you first heard about Karate Kid: Legends, did you feel any hesitancy about going back to the character yet again?Yeah. But even with Cobra Kai, I knew it was time to jump in the water, I just didn't know the temperature of the pool. With Karate Kid: Legends, it was exciting to look at, “Wow, I started this on the big screen. Can I end it on the big screen?”


	Connecting the worlds was the challenge. They figured out a way to do that that is organic to a scene in The Karate Kid Part II, that people on the internet are starting to figure out, which connects that karate comes from kung fu, which is the truth. My thing was trying to uphold the integrity of Miyagi and Daniel and the mythology of the original movie.


	And so it required a little bit of back and forth work, and working with Jackie Chan. The movie picks up years after Cobra Kai. There's a different version of Daniel that is more at peace in his life and more Miyagi, in a way.


Did you know Jackie Chan prior to this?I did not. But I did meet him at the premiere of the 2010 [Karate Kid] remake. But that always just felt like another island. Now it feels like part of the ecosystem in the grand universe. I feel very Luke Skywalker. I could be on The Mandalorian, and I could be in a Star Wars movie.

	











What was it like working with Ben Wang, the young star of Legends? It must have been cool to watch someone start a journey that you started 40 years ago.Exactly. He's terrific. He's also a dedicated young martial artist. He speaks fluent Mandarin. He checked so many of the boxes, and he has a very winning personality, which is super-important. And if you've seen the trailer, you can tell that it feels cinematic. It doesn't feel like the original Karate Kid movie, the Eighties, and it doesn't feel like Cobra Kai, either. And I like that, because it says that we could exist in this place.


Do you think this is your last time playing Daniel?Might I do my Gran Torino version? Listen, I hope the movie does well. I want it to be the next stage of other chapters, and I'd love there to be a Cobra Kai movie in two years from now as well. I mean, why not keep the party going as long as it can be rooted in some form of genuine truth? Listen, if you came to me in 1995 and said, “You're going to play Daniel LaRusso again.” I would say, “It's never going to happen.” So, never say never. Never say never.


You don't see Kreese or Terry Silver actually die when the boat blows up in the Cobra Kai finale. Maybe at least one of them lives…I know. It's not my single favorite moment in the story. And the fact that nobody mentions anything about it… Listen, what can you say? They wanted to do that.


What do you hope to accomplish in the next few years?I'd like to do a little more directing. I directed Episode Three of this season of Cobra Kai. I really loved that. I love working with the actors. I love taking a piece of what I've learned from the Coppolas and the Avildsens. I remember them setting shots or discussing something, and just taking that and implementing it myself. That's something that I have a lot more room to grow with.

	I don't need to be the lead. I'd love to fit in some sort of family that maybe is not about “every argument needs to be solved with a karate bloodbath.”

Alf Clausen, the longtime composer on The Simpsons who scored countless iconic moments on the animated series, has died at the age of 84.


	The Emmy-winning composer died Thursday at his home in Los Angeles following an eight-year battle with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), Clausen's daughter told the Hollywood Reporter.


	Clausen served as composer on The Simpsons from the series' second season in 1990 (starting with the inaugural “Treehouse of Horror” episode) through its 28th season in 2017, after which he was — to the chagrin of the show's fans — fired in a controversial cost-cutting move. However, Clausen maintained the honorary title of “Composer Emeritus” on subsequent seasons.


	“Alf was the ‘Man of a Thousand Music Cues' — actually probably more than 10,000 — during his decades on The Simpsons,” creator Matt Groening told Variety. “He was tireless, inspired, and always up for the musical challenges we threw at him. I called him our secret weapon.”

	The Minneapolis-born, North Dakota-raised, and Berklee College of Music-educated Clausen began his career in movies and television in the mid-Seventies, working his way up from music copyist and arranger to orchestrater (including on Ferris Bueller's Day Off) to conductor to composer, with the TV series Moonlighting his first major and prolonged gig in the role; Clausen received six of his unprecedented 30 Emmy nominations for his work on Moonlighting.

	











	Following a stint as the composer (fittingly, given his name) on Alf, Clausen was enlisted to join The Simpsons during to the Fox series' second season. While the show's famed opening theme was created by Danny Elfman (though Clausen rearranged it beginning in Season 3), Clausen scored hundreds of memorable moments in Springfield over the course of nearly 600 episodes, with Clausen reportedly commanding a 35-piece orchestra for each show.

	“I was posed the question, ‘Would you like to score an animated show?' and I said, ‘No,'” Clausen told Television Academy Foundation website The Interviews in 2015. “I said, ‘I just got off of four years of Moonlighting, and I really want to be a drama composer. I'm more interested in doing longform feature films.'”


	However, Groening managed to persuade Clausen to take the assignment. “[Groening] said he didn't want it scored like a typical Warner Bros. cartoon. He didn't want it scored like a typical Disney cartoon,” Clausen added. “He wanted something different.”


	Clausen's Simpsons work was collected for a trio of albums showcasing his scores: 1997's Songs in the Key of Springfield, 1999's Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons, and 2007's The Simpsons: Testify. Clausen was also nominated for over 20 Primetime Emmys for his work on The Simpsons, resulting in two wins for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music and Lyrics: First in 1998 for “We Put The Spring In Springfield” and again the following year for You're Checkin' In.”

	Following Clausen's dismissal from The Simpsons, the series brought the music production company Bleeding Fingers Music, which was founded by Hans Zimmer, Russell Emanuel and Steve Kofsky; Zimmer notably scored The Simpsons Movie, with a spurned Clausen quipping at the time, “Sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug.”


	Clausen would later file a lawsuit against Fox and The Simpsons producers in 2019, claiming his firing was due to ageism; the majority of the lawsuit was dismissed by a judge, and Clausen ultimately settled the case in 2022.

It's been five years since Supernatural ended, and even now, fans are still processing the divisive finale. After fifteen seasons of following Sam and Dean Winchester as they battled supernatural forces, Supernatural aired its final episode in November 2020. The way the show ended has since divided fans, with many feeling the show ended on a rushed note that didn't do Sam and Dean justice. As a result, many fans have questioned whether the show would've been better off ending at a more natural point in an earlier season.

Supernatural premiered in 2005 and quickly became one of the most popular CW shows. The horror-drama followed the Winchester brothers as they traveled across the U.S., hunting monsters, demons, and mythological creatures. However, by the time Season 5 wrapped, signs of creative fatigue had already surfaced. From that point on, the show continued to push forward, season after season, often bypassing natural endpoints in favor of staying on the air. Supernatural would have been better off ending at one of those earlier points. Looking back, it's clear the show had several moments where a more satisfying conclusion could have been made.

When Supernatural first premiered, creator Eric Kripke originally planned for the show to finish after five seasons, with the season finale, Swan Song, being the definitive conclusion to the Winchester brothers' journey. Arguably, this was probably the best decision since the episode brought closure to the show's central mythology, resolved major character arcs, and offered an emotional farewell that honored what the show had built since its debut. The apocalypse storyline reached its climax, Lucifer was finally confronted, and Dean's arc was brought full circle. It was everything Kripke had originally promised.

But that ending never stuck. Despite Kripke's exit after Season 5, the CW renewed the show. Ratings remained strong, keeping the series commercially viable. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki had contracts that extended through a sixth season, which helped enable the show to continue. The network's decision was driven by the show's consistent viewership numbers and its established fan base, making it a financially sound choice to keep producing new episodes beyond the originally planned conclusion.

On The CW's Supernatural, the Winchester brothers battle the forces of evil. These are some of the best monster-filled episodes in the show's history.

Supernatural was never meant to go beyond five seasons, and by the time Season 6 arrived, the show's momentum had already faded. While the series eventually surpassed 300 episodes, the storylines buckled under the pressure to keep things fresh. The balance between new ideas and recycled plot devices became harder to maintain, and the series quickly felt stretched. The strength of its original arc gave way to creative weakness, and over time, the impact of those first five seasons diminished.

The CW has a history of prioritizing sensationalism over substance, with shows like Riverdale and shelved projects like The Powerpuff Girls reboot reflecting that trend. Supernatural was no exception. The series thrived when it leaned into its horror roots and kept its tone realistic. But in its later years, it drifted away from what initially made it exciting. The storytelling became increasingly self-referential, with a tone that often bordered on parody. As the show moved further from its original identity, it resembled something closer to fan fiction than the tightly structured horror-drama it once was.

Season 11 of Supernatural presented an interesting storyline that offered an ideal endpoint for the series. The arc focused on the release of the Darkness, Amara, God's estranged sister, who threatened to consume the world in shadow. At the season's climax, instead of the usual showdown, peace was arranged between Amara and God, signaling a rare resolution through understanding. This ending gave the Winchesters a moment of genuine happiness. Dean's mother, Mary, was resurrected, and the brothers seemed to finally enjoy some stability after years of loss.

Yet, despite this promising conclusion, the CW opted to extend Supernatural beyond Season 11. Ratings remained strong, and the network saw continued value in keeping the fan-favorite series on the air. The storylines introduced in Season 11 also opened doors for more supernatural threats and character developments, which the writers leveraged in subsequent seasons. Financial considerations, contractual obligations with the lead actors, and a loyal fanbase all contributed to the decision to push the story forward, even as many fans and critics felt the show had naturally reached a satisfying conclusion.

Like the Winchesters, Castiel has also died a few times in Supernatural, only to be brought back every time for some higher purpose. 

As it turns out, the version of the Supernatural finale that aired in 2020 wasn't the one originally planned. According to co-showrunner Andrew Dabb, the general premise remained the same — Dean dying and going to heaven, and Sam living out the rest of his life — but the details were supposed to be far more ambitious. The final scene wasn't initially meant to be a reunion with Bobby Singer on a peaceful bridge. Instead, Dean was supposed to arrive at a saintly version of Harvelle's Roadhouse, greeted by a crowd of familiar faces. That would have included long-dead friends, family, and fellow hunters, all there to welcome Dean home.

While not every cameo was officially confirmed, it's easy to imagine who would've been there. Castiel and Jack were obvious choices, given their ties to the Winchesters and Heaven's new order. So were John and Mary Winchester, whose reconciliation had already been teased in the show's 300th episode. Rufus Turner would've likely made an appearance, along with the Roadhouse's original namesakes, Ellen and Jo Harvelle, and probably Ash, too, complete with his signature mullet and grin. It would've been a true celebration of the series' legacy, a who's who of beloved characters returning one last time.

In the macabre world of The CW's Supernatural, the Winchester brothers have faced some of the most vile and powerful villains in TV history.

There was even talk of a live performance by Kansas, the band behind the show's unofficial anthem Carry On Wayward Son, which plays over nearly every season finale. The scene would've been a full-circle celebration of the show's legacy, concluding with an unforgettable moment. But it never happened. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted production during the final stretch of filming, forcing the crew to scale back significantly. Restrictions and safety protocols made large gatherings impossible, and the finale that fans saw was a stripped-down version of what was intended.

It was still emotional, but it lacked the closure that the original ending promised. After fifteen seasons, Supernatural deserved to go out with an emotional bang. Looking back, Supernatural didn't suffer from a lack of endings, it suffered from ignoring the good ones it already had. Whether it was Season 5's apocalyptic finale or the neat resolution of Season 11, the show repeatedly found moments that could've wrapped things up in a way that honored its story. Instead, it kept going in favor of the show's success. The Winchesters eventually got their farewell, just not the one they, or the audience, really earned.

This spinoff brought fan-favorite characters together in a community-centered story that was unique but also very Supernatural.

Classic Doctor Who wasn't perfect, but one episode was so problematic that it was banned from a country and remains a dark part of the series.

Follow:


            Hamas on Saturday said that it has responded to a Gaza ceasefire plan put forward by the US, repeating its call for an end to the war, in a move the US' Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, called “totally unacceptable.”
    


            In a statement, Hamas said that its “proposal” to the mediators – Qatar and Egypt — “aims to achieve a permanent ceasefire, a comprehensive withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and ensure the flow of aid to our people and our families in the Gaza Strip.”
    


            “As part of this agreement, 10 living Israeli prisoners held by the resistance will be released, in addition to the return of 18 bodies, in exchange for an agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners,” the statement said.
    


            It comes after a senior Hamas official told CNN earlier this week that the group had sent back a three-pronged counterproposal requesting US assurances that the negotiations over a permanent ceasefire will continue and the fighting will not resume after the pause; that humanitarian assistance be carried out through the United Nations; and that the IDF pull back to the positions that they held on March 2.
    


            Witkoff said in a post on X Saturday that he received Hamas' response, calling it “totally unacceptable” and writing that it “only takes us backward.”
    


            “Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week,” Witkoff continued.
    


            An Israeli official told CNN on Saturday that they saw the militant group's latest response as having “effectively rejected the latest Witkoff proposal and put forward a new offer with its own conditions.”
    


            Later the same day, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office reiterated Witkoff's reaction to Hamas' response, saying in a statement: “While Israel has agreed to the updated Witkoff outline for the release of our hostages, Hamas continues to adhere to its refusal.”
    


            “Israel will continue its action for the return of our hostages and the defeat of Hamas,” the statement said.
    


            The US-backed and Israel-approved proposal seen by CNN on Friday includes Hamas releasing 10 Israeli hostages and 18 deceased hostages in exchange for 125 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and 1,111 Gazans detained since the war began.

            Negotiations toward a permanent ceasefire would begin immediately on the first day of the 60-day truce, according to the US proposal. The terms of the agreement would also allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza “immediately” and be distributed “through agreed upon channels,” including the United Nations and the Red Crescent, according to the proposal.
    


            But the draft agreement contained no intrinsic guarantee of a permanent end to the war, a key Hamas demand, nor assurances that the ceasefire will be extended as long as negotiations continue. Instead, it said that US President Donald Trump is “committed to working to ensure that good faith negotiations continue until a final agreement is reached.”
    


            Hamas had initially signaled reluctance to accept the terms of the deal. Bassem Naim, a member of the Hamas political bureau, said on Facebook Thursday that the framework did “not respond to any of our people's demands” but that discussions were underway, nonetheless.
    


            The back-and-forth between Israel and Hamas comes as famine conditions worsen in the Gaza Strip.
    


            Israel's 11-week blockade of humanitarian aid has left the enclave's population facing starvation. Though it was lifted last week, much of the little aid that has entered the strip since has been looted, and several people have been killed after chaos broke out near aid distribution sites, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
    


            Nearly 80 aid trucks traveling through southern and central Gaza were looted by desperate civilians on Saturday, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) said.
    


            In a statement issued on X, the WFP said 77 trucks had crossed into Gaza loaded with flour. All of them “were stopped along the way, with food taken mainly by hungry people trying to feed their families.”
    


            It added that “after 80 days of a total blockade, communities are starving – and they are no longer willing to let food pass them by.”

The USWNT is coming off a 2-1 loss to Brazil in a friendly back in April, the second loss in the last three matches for the team. Catarina Macario scored in the first minute of the game as it looked the US would roll, but that goal was all the team managed in the match.

The loss represented the first time the USWNT had lost two times in three tries since its three-game losing streak to England, Spain, and Germany back in 2022.

Meanwhile, China is coming off back-to-back wins in April in the Yongchuan International Tournament, beating Uzbekistan 5-0 and Thailand 5-1. The team has won three of its first matches in 2025, beating Chinese Taipei, losing to Mexico, and drawing with Canada, all during the Pinatar Cup.

The 27-year-old has reached the second week of Roland Garros for the first time after wondering if he would be 'out of tennis' earlier this season.ByTENNIS.comPublished May 31, 2025 copy_link

Twelve months ago at Roland Garros, Alexander Bublik was a Top 20 player. Holding a ranking he never imagined possible, Bublik felt compelled to become more of a “professional solider” and less of a free spirit.He trained harder, he adopted a stricter diet, he shied away from parties. Yet by March of this year, the Kazakh found himself outside of the Top 80. His stretch of tough blows and early exits wasn't the result of poor effort, but rather, reaching empty on the gas tank.“Right now everybody is like robots, and they're just crazy, crazy performance guys. Then I did it. Unfortunately, to be honest, my fall was not linked with lack of attitude and lack of practicing. It was the exact opposite. I just burned out because I was waiting for the results to come,” Bublik reflected Saturday to reporters in Paris.

At Indian Wells, the 27-year-old bowed out in the first round to Yosuke Watanuki on a Wednesday afternoon. With time to spare, his coach Artem Suprunov suggested taking a road trip to Las Vegas ahead of the Phoenix Challenger. With his pupil posting two wins and eight losses to start his season, Suprunov kept it real, as Bublik tells it.“He's like, ‘Man, if you play like this, we're just going to be out of tennis', of the conversation by Wimbledon because that's where my points are. After Wimbledon I made, like, 50 points,” he recalled.Bublik agreed to the change of pace, spending three days in the Sin City and turning up for his opener in Phoenix a few hours beforehand with the mindset he was “useless” and simply needed to “let it be.”The approach did the trick.“I said, ‘Okay, let's go to Vegas.' We enjoy. We change the racquet. We did many things. I said, Okay, if it goes, it goes. If not, thank you very much, tennis, and it worked,” he said.

Bublik went on to finish runner-up to Joao Fonseca in turning a corner. By his third event of the clay-court season, he strung together three wins—including a Top 10 victory over reigning title holder Andrey Rublev–en route to the round of 16 at the Mutua Madrid Open. Prior to arriving in the French capital for the second major of the year, Bublik stood in the winners' circle at the Turin Challenger.The momentum swing has carried into Roland Garros, where Bublik finds himself in the second week for the first time thanks to a run that includes a two-set comeback against ninth seed Alex de Minaur in-between a pair of straight-set wins.“I just took matches way more seriously, because I can't see myself out (of the) Top 100 and not being able to play the tournaments I like to play, because I still have courage to play tennis,” he said.“That's why. I guess there was just a shift in the mentality because I had no options whatsoever.”

Twelve months ago at Roland Garros, Alexander Bublik was a Top 20 player. Holding a ranking he never imagined possible, Bublik felt compelled to become more of a “professional solider” and less of a free spirit.He trained harder, he adopted a stricter diet, he shied away from parties. Yet by March of this year, the Kazakh found himself outside of the Top 80. His stretch of tough blows and early exits wasn't the result of poor effort, but rather, reaching empty on the gas tank.“Right now everybody is like robots, and they're just crazy, crazy performance guys. Then I did it. Unfortunately, to be honest, my fall was not linked with lack of attitude and lack of practicing. It was the exact opposite. I just burned out because I was waiting for the results to come,” Bublik reflected Saturday to reporters in Paris.

At Indian Wells, the 27-year-old bowed out in the first round to Yosuke Watanuki on a Wednesday afternoon. With time to spare, his coach Artem Suprunov suggested taking a road trip to Las Vegas ahead of the Phoenix Challenger. With his pupil posting two wins and eight losses to start his season, Suprunov kept it real, as Bublik tells it.“He's like, ‘Man, if you play like this, we're just going to be out of tennis', of the conversation by Wimbledon because that's where my points are. After Wimbledon I made, like, 50 points,” he recalled.Bublik agreed to the change of pace, spending three days in the Sin City and turning up for his opener in Phoenix a few hours beforehand with the mindset he was “useless” and simply needed to “let it be.”The approach did the trick.“I said, ‘Okay, let's go to Vegas.' We enjoy. We change the racquet. We did many things. I said, Okay, if it goes, it goes. If not, thank you very much, tennis, and it worked,” he said.

Bublik went on to finish runner-up to Joao Fonseca in turning a corner. By his third event of the clay-court season, he strung together three wins—including a Top 10 victory over reigning title holder Andrey Rublev–en route to the round of 16 at the Mutua Madrid Open. Prior to arriving in the French capital for the second major of the year, Bublik stood in the winners' circle at the Turin Challenger.The momentum swing has carried into Roland Garros, where Bublik finds himself in the second week for the first time thanks to a run that includes a two-set comeback against ninth seed Alex de Minaur in-between a pair of straight-set wins.“I just took matches way more seriously, because I can't see myself out (of the) Top 100 and not being able to play the tournaments I like to play, because I still have courage to play tennis,” he said.“That's why. I guess there was just a shift in the mentality because I had no options whatsoever.”

Like his next opponent, the left-hander is more known for producing the goods on quicker surfaces but has translated his game tremendously to the terre battue. With today's decisive dismissal of Fonseca, Draper has won 12 clay-court matches this spring – having held nine in his career prior to 2025.“Jack for me is insane. I saw him first day here. I'm like, ‘Are you getting ready for UFC?' Last year the guy is 40 in the world. This year he is Top 4, Top 5 in the world. That's a crazy achievement,” said Bublik.“He doesn't seem to stop, so I mean, what do I have to do to beat him? I don't know. I will just go there, enjoy the time, show what I'm capable of showing, and we all know what I'm capable of doing on court and then we see how it goes.”
