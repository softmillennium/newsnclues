                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 27-year-old has reached the second week of Roland Garros for the first time after wondering if he would be 'out of tennis' earlier this season.ByTENNIS.comPublished May 31, 2025 copy_link Twelve months ago at Roland Garros, Alexander Bublik was a Top 20 player. Holding a ranking he never imagined possible, Bublik felt compelled to become more of a “professional solider” and less of a free spirit.He trained harder, he adopted a stricter diet, he shied away from parties. Yet by March of this year, the Kazakh found himself outside of the Top 80. His stretch of tough blows and early exits wasn't the result of poor effort, but rather, reaching empty on the gas tank.“Right now everybody is like robots, and they're just crazy, crazy performance guys. Unfortunately, to be honest, my fall was not linked with lack of attitude and lack of practicing. I just burned out because I was waiting for the results to come,” Bublik reflected Saturday to reporters in Paris. Yet by March of this year, the Kazakh found himself outside of the Top 80.

I just burned out because I was waiting for the results to come,” Bublik reflected Saturday to reporters in Paris. At Indian Wells, the 27-year-old bowed out in the first round to Yosuke Watanuki on a Wednesday afternoon. With time to spare, his coach Artem Suprunov suggested taking a road trip to Las Vegas ahead of the Phoenix Challenger. With his pupil posting two wins and eight losses to start his season, Suprunov kept it real, as Bublik tells it.“He's like, ‘Man, if you play like this, we're just going to be out of tennis', of the conversation by Wimbledon because that's where my points are. After Wimbledon I made, like, 50 points,” he recalled.Bublik agreed to the change of pace, spending three days in the Sin City and turning up for his opener in Phoenix a few hours beforehand with the mindset he was “useless” and simply needed to “let it be.”The approach did the trick.“I said, ‘Okay, let's go to Vegas.' If not, thank you very much, tennis, and it worked,” he said. “He's like, ‘Man, if you play like this, we're just going to be out of tennis', of the conversation by Wimbledon because that's where my points are.

By his third event of the clay-court season, he strung together three wins—including a Top 10 victory over reigning title holder Andrey Rublev–en route to the round of 16 at the Mutua Madrid Open. Prior to arriving in the French capital for the second major of the year, Bublik stood in the winners' circle at the Turin Challenger.The momentum swing has carried into Roland Garros, where Bublik finds himself in the second week for the first time thanks to a run that includes a two-set comeback against ninth seed Alex de Minaur in-between a pair of straight-set wins.“I just took matches way more seriously, because I can't see myself out (of the) Top 100 and not being able to play the tournaments I like to play, because I still have courage to play tennis,” he said.“That's why. I guess there was just a shift in the mentality because I had no options whatsoever.” The momentum swing has carried into Roland Garros, where Bublik finds himself in the second week for the first time thanks to a run that includes a two-set comeback against ninth seed Alex de Minaur in-between a pair of straight-set wins.“I just took matches way more seriously, because I can't see myself out (of the) Top 100 and not being able to play the tournaments I like to play, because I still have courage to play tennis,” he said.“That's why.

Like his next opponent, the left-hander is more known for producing the goods on quicker surfaces but has translated his game tremendously to the terre battue. With today's decisive dismissal of Fonseca, Draper has won 12 clay-court matches this spring – having held nine in his career prior to 2025.“Jack for me is insane. I saw him first day here. I'm like, ‘Are you getting ready for UFC?' That's a crazy achievement,” said Bublik.“He doesn't seem to stop, so I mean, what do I have to do to beat him? I will just go there, enjoy the time, show what I'm capable of showing, and we all know what I'm capable of doing on court and then we see how it goes.” On Monday, Bublik looks to cool off fifth-seeded Jack Draper.

British No 1 Draper, the fifth seed in Paris, beat Fonseca 6-2 6-4 6-2 to secure a fourth-round clash with Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik, who breezed past Portuguese qualifier Henrique Rocha 7-5 6-1 6-2. Sinner trounced Jiri Lehecka 6-0 6-1 6-2 earlier on Saturday - the Italian is yet to drop a set in the tournament - and will next face Russian 17th seed Andrey Rublev at Roland-Garros. He pounced on Fonseca's efforts to wrong foot him with drop shots, seizing those opportunities to punish the Brazilian. He remained assured in the second set, taking advantage of Fonseca's mistakes to exert further pressure on the Brazilian teenager. He staved off Fonseca's attempt to fight back as he closed out the second set and made sure to take control of the third set from the very start. Fonseca clawed two games back, but never threatened to overhaul the Briton. "I served pretty well and mentally it was a good performance from me. Either way I'll be ready for my next round. This was Draper and Fonseca's second meeting on the ATP Tour, with Draper also winning the first - at Indian Wells in March en route to claiming the biggest title of his career to date. Draper had never won a match at the French Open prior to this year, losing in the first round in 2023 and 2024, but is now a genuine title contender.

This is the furthest Pegula has advanced at the French Open since she was a quarterfinalist in 2022. She reached the third round in 2023 and withdrew from the tournament last year due to a neck injury. Pegula has won WTA events in Austin and Charleston this season, and reached the third round at the Australian Open. Last season she was a U.S. Open finalist, but lost in the second round of the other major tournaments she played in.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We talk in tennis of a transition game, moving from one set of strokes to the next, moving seamlessly up the court from one position to another. Professional tennis is undergoing a more cosmic transition game, pivoting from the Big Three/Serena Williams Era—where four bankable, historically great players each won more than 20 majors—to an era of many stars, if not quite at the same wattage. This was thrown into relief during Week 1 at Roland Garros of 2025. Then, play commenced and attention turned to active players. A spirited Brazilian contingent (is there any other kind?) made the matches of 18-year-old Joao Fonseca seem like World Cup qualifiers. Arthur Fils lent hope that there could be a homegrown men's champ for the first since the 80s. The field is gloriously open with possibility. As this event, also, makes the turn … herewith our 2025 French Open midterm grades: The Turnaround artists: A week before the event Novak Djokovic and Iga Świątek had won a combined zero titles in the last 50 weeks and both, for different reasons, looked to be declining assets. Even at 38, he is doing a fine Djokovic impersonation And, rejuvenated by returning to Roland Garros she is looking like a fine bet to take another title. (And the lone loss came from a player, Taylor Fritz, who has been injured and struggling for much of the year.) Teenage created draw wasteland: Twenty is the new … 20. Special commendation to Mirra Andreeva and then 18-year-old revelations Fonseca of Brazil and Victoria Mboko or Canada. Ethan Quinn: Lone American to qualify for the main draw, former Georgia Bulldog keeps winning. The Rafa Nadal Tribute: Like all tournaments, this one does some things right, some things not so right. And at this writing, three men are still alive—gritty Tommy Paul, cruising Ben Shelton and resurgent Frances Tiafoe—into Week 2, first time since 1995. The USTA: After an encouraging week here—and a week after announcing an $800 million overhaul of Arthur Ashe Stadium—it is in search of a new  leader, as chief executive Lew Sherr leaves abruptly to take an executive position with the New York Mets. But only Djokovic (38) remains as Gael Monfils (38), Richard Gasquet (39 this month) and Stan Wawrinka (40) all bow out. In the case of Gasquet, this marked his final Roland Garros. Naomi Osaka: A rough draw (made possible by her lack of a seeding); an entertaining battlel signs of top-shelf, winning form; ultimately a losing result. Four-time major champ goes out to Paula Badosa. Arthur Fils: French star—and he is a star—wins two matches. The night session distribution: Even if the tournament stands by its reasoning to make this a 1950s-style men's only club—through the first week, zero women's matches made the night session—simply from an optics/PR perspective, you'd think they'd come up with an equitable workaround. Recent NCAA women's singles champs: Emma Navarro  (2021 UVA) and Peyton Stearns (2022 Texas) were both seeded here. Who has gone by way of Novo Nordisk stock. Out of top 10 and without a title since spring 2023, former No.1 loses in Round 1. Courtside signage: We all understand balance sheets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John and Patrick McEnroe have both had their say on the scheduling of the tennis calendar, coming to a unanimous decision. Their thoughts were far from unpopular either, echoing the sentiment that so many players have complained about in the last few years. It feels like as the sport grows the demand on the athletes only increases, pushing these athletes, who are already performing superhuman feats of physical exertion, to new heights. Eventually, something dangerous will happen, with a few cautionary tales having already emerged. Fortunately, Patrick has heard something that could ease the burden somewhat. Speaking live on TNT Sports' US coverage, they took a moment amidst the chaos of Jack Draper's win over Joao Fonseca to discuss the ongoing scheduling problem tennis seems to have. He claimed: ‘A lot of players, mainly the ones that have lost complaining about the schedule. We've been talking about that for 40-50 years. ‘If they moved the Australian to later, that would give more time, but they don't want to give that up. Patrick McEnroe offered a solution: ‘I'm hearing rumblings that it could move to February.' However, Pat was not completely optimistic: ‘Of course, there'd probably be another big tournament put in in early January, that's part of potentially the plan. ‘It's pretty typical of all sports like in the NBA you see players taking nights off under contract. Top players have big endorsement deals but even those normally have stipulations that the players have to play certain events or be ranked at a certain spot to collect the money.' John then ended their chat with a simple message, noting: ‘Players should be able to play when they want, do what's best for themselves.' A sort of union for players, this marks a big step in the right direction towards lessening the physical turmoil exacted upon the players. At the moment, they are given just a slender month or so to enjoy some downtime before the season starts right back up again.</p>

"Especially this court is so special to me. I've had some of the best and worst memories of my life on this court.

"The crowd always supports me. The love story continues."

Zverev has reached at least the semi-finals on each of his last four appearances at Roland Garros.

"He (Cobolli) probably should have won the second set, but I kept fighting and then I had a bit of a mental advantage and it went my way."

Griekspoor battled past American Ethan Quinn 4-6, 6-1, 6-7(2), 6-1, 6-4 in three hours and 16 minutes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jack Draper laid down another marker in his standout season on Saturday at Roland Garros, where he dispatched the supremely talented #NextGenATP Brazilian Joao Fonseca 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 to reach the fourth round in Paris for the first time. Hype was high surrounding Draper's second Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with 18-year-old Fonseca, who had not dropped a set en route to reaching the third round at a major for the first time. However, the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion Fonseca struggled for consistency. He was unable to live with Draper's power and physicality in the hot and lively conditions on Court Suzanne-Lenglen. The British lefty hit his heavy topspin forehand with depth and was relaxed for large periods, striking with liquid power to dominate the brutal baseline exchanges. The conditions were quite difficult out here. I felt that the first set was really key," Draper said. "Then I kind of got on top of him, used my forehand well, served well and mentally it was a good performance from me and I am happy to be in the second week here." Cool, calm, clinical 🧼A commanding 6-2 6-4 6-2 win over Fonseca takes @jackdraper0 into the Round of 16! Draper arrived at Roland Garros having not won a match in two previous appearances at the clay-court major. 5 in the PIF ATP Rankings is a different proposition this year, though. Holding a 25-6 record on the season, Draper will continue the quest for his first major against Alexander Bublik, who beat Portuguese qualifier Henrique Rocha 7-5, 6-1, 6-2. "In my first two rounds I played in the night time and playing against Gael [Monfils] the other night I didn't feel I could hit the ball past him," Draper said on the conditions at this year's Roland Garros. The Brazilian was backed by vocal support throughout his three matches in the French capital but was unable to give them anything to cheer about against Draper, overhitting all too often. The 18-year-old leaves Roland Garros up 10 places at No. He is an incredible young player and so much to come from him," Draper said on Fonseca. "I think today maybe a bit of experience [was the difference]. He hasn't played as many Grand Slams as myself but I think he has an incredibly bright future at the top of the game."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Britain's Jack Draper underlined his status as one of the world's leading players with a ruthlessly efficient win over Brazilian rising star Joao Fonseca in the French Open third round. Fonseca only broke into the world's top 100 earlier this year, but has created a buzz with his explosive style and ferocious forehand. Draper quickly diffused what could have been a tricky encounter, showing his superior quality and experience from the start. Possessing tools which are effective across all surfaces has seen Draper turn into a French Open contender. Reaching the Madrid Open final was an early sign of improvement and his performances in Paris have backed that up. Patience was needed in victories over Italy's Mattia Bellucci and French veteran Gael Monfils. In increasingly faster conditions, the speed and spin of Draper's forehand was particularly difficult for Fonseca to handle as the Briton quickly went a double break up. A double fault for 30-30 in the eighth game offered Fonseca faint hope, before Draper rediscovered his first serve and returned well to take the opening set in 29 minutes. Momentum - and crowd support - started to build for Fonseca in a tighter second set, but Draper quickly extinguished hope with solid service games. Draper continued to play smartly at the start of the third set, mixing depth of return with deft drop-shots on his way to wrapping up victory. A carnival mood led by thousands of Brazilians has followed Fonseca from Melbourne to Paris this year. Fans patiently queue to see his matches on the smaller courts at the majors, with some people setting up camp at Roland Garros hours before his first two matches. While there was plenty of Brazilian support - easily identified by splashes of yellow and green national flags and Selecao football shirts - it was far from a difficult atmosphere for Draper to handle.

So yeah, I got some issues like this in the past already.” The young star, who impressed at Wimbledon last year by reaching the fourth round, acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding his return, stating, “I will try to be ready for Wimbledon, but we are not sure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arthur Fils has revealed that he could be sidelined for four to six weeks and risks missing Wimbledon after withdrawing from his home Grand Slam tournament. 1 overcame back issues to beat Jaume Munar in a thrilling four-hour and 25-minute match on Thursday and ripped his shirt off in celebration when he won. On Saturday morning, he confirmed he had a stress fracture in his back that will leave him in a race against time to return at the All England Club next month. “I had some issue with the back since a long time, and during the match against Munar it gets worse. The exams were not good at all. “Yeah, whatever, we decide with the team it was better to stop now, because if I'm stopping now, I could stop for only four to six weeks. If I was pushing myself too much, I would probably stop for a couple of months.” So yeah, I got some issues like this in the past already.” The 20-year-old explained why his back had caused him so much trouble, adding: “It's an injury that happens quite often when you are a child. I had to wear a back brace. But also, my lower back is arched, so then I had a bone marrow edema.

I don't know which one yet. I will try to be ready for Wimbledon, but we are not sure. To be honest, we don't know. I don't want to be in a hurry on the tour. I don't need to ramp up everything. Fils received an off-court medical time-out before the fourth set of his second-round clash with Munar on Thursday. Eventually, painkillers and adrenaline kicked in, and the home crowd helped him come back from a break down in the decider to win 7-6 7-6 2-6 0-6 6-4. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. But yeah, then no chance to play.” But Munar wasn't convinced of Fils' injuries after he won five of the last six games in a row. On Thursday, the Spaniard said: “He was seen by the doctor for a suspected back injury, but I'm convinced he suffered cramps. In that case, he couldn't have been treated. While Fils will be devastated to pull out of his home Grand Slam tournament, the 20-year-old will at the very least be able to watch his beloved PSG in the Champions League final on Saturday night, though he won't be taking a last-minute flight to Munich and will follow it on TV.
