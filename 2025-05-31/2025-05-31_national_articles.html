Ukraine suffered another bombardment of aerial attacks from Russia Friday night into Saturday morning as successful talks toward a peace deal to end the war appear far from happening.

There were 114 aerial attacks on Ukraine via drones and missiles overnight, with at least 10 people being killed and 33 others injured due to the Russian attacks, according to ABC News. Russia has continued heavy attacks on Ukrainian cities even as President Donald Trump attempts to broker peace and a ceasefire between the countries.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier this week that “Russian strikes are becoming increasingly brazen and large-scale every night” and has encouraged western allies, like the U.S., to exert more pressure on Russia to agree to a ceasefire and end to the war.

Trump, who was more critical of Ukraine in earlier months this year, has recently become increasingly critical of Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin.

Last weekend, Trump said he would “absolutely” consider sanctions on Russia when talking with reporters and added that he was “not happy” with Putin's continued attacks on Ukrainian cities.

On Tuesday, Trump continued to express his frustration with Russia, saying that Putin was “playing with fire.”

“What Vladimir Putin doesn't realize is that if it weren't for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD. He's playing with fire!” Trump said in a Truth Social post.

RUSSIAN AND US OFFICIALS RATCHET UP RHETORIC AS PROGRESS ON PEACE STALLS

Trump then said in remarks Wednesday that he would give the Russian president two weeks to show he was serious about ending the Russia-Ukraine war or if he was “tapping us along.”

The U.S. president had claimed on the campaign trail last year that he would quickly resolve the conflict that broke out in February 2022, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but getting the two countries to a peace deal has taken significantly longer than he predicted.</p>

Secretary Pete Hegseth denied China's assertion that Golden Dome was an effort to turn space into a 'war zone,' arguing it was only for defense of the homeland. U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued a stark warning Saturday at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore: China's military is "rehearsing for the real deal," and a full-scale invasion of Taiwan "could be imminent." "We are not going to sugarcoat it – the threat China poses is real," he added. Rear Admiral Hu Gangfeng, head of the Chinese delegation and vice president of China's National Defense University, called the remarks "groundless accusations," stating that "some of the claims are completely fabricated, some distort facts and some are cases of a thief crying ‘stop thief.'" Despite such denials, a growing body of evidence suggests China may indeed be preparing for a military move against Taiwan. Taiwan's National Security Council Secretary-General Joseph Wu, Taiwan's President William Lai and Taiwan's Defense Minister Wellington Koo pose for photos with soldiers as they visit the troops during the Rapid Response Exercise at the Songshan military airbase in Taipei on March 21, 2025. China has intensified its joint sea and air exercises surrounding Taiwan, including rehearsals simulating blockades, encirclements, and amphibious assaults. These drills closely mirror operational strategies that would likely be employed in an actual invasion and are widely interpreted by analysts as concrete signals of Beijing's willingness to use force. The Peoples' Liberation Army (PLA) has positioned H-6 bombers, capable of delivering nuclear payloads, on outposts such as Woody Island in the South China Sea. China's President Xi Jinping could be planning an attack on Taiwan. China continues to conduct gray-zone operations aka non-kinetic forms of coercion, including cyberattacks on Taiwan's infrastructure, disinformation campaigns, and illegal incursions by maritime militia vessels. Though these actions fall below the threshold of open warfare, they are designed to wear down Taiwan's defenses and destabilize the region. According to U.S. intelligence assessments, Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed the PLA to be capable of launching an invasion of Taiwan by 2027. While not a confirmed deadline for action, it has catalyzed PLA modernization, emphasizing joint force integration and amphibious readiness. China's strategic expansion in Latin America – especially through Belt and Road investments and attempts to influence key nodes such as the Panama Canal reflect broader ambitions to project global power and encircle U.S. interests. These moves indirectly support Taiwan-related ambitions by distracting or overextending U.S. response capabilities. Recent PLA exercises have incorporated civilian ferries capable of transporting tanks and personnel—suggesting preparations for amphibious operations on Taiwan's shores. The dual-use nature of these assets allows China to mask military buildup under the guise of civilian activity. Beijing has intensified its political narrative around "reunification," including state media coverage, educational reforms, and speeches by top Chinese officials. These ideological signals often precede military action in authoritarian regimes. 8, China has rapidly expanded its coastal infrastructure, including new docks, airstrips, and logistics hubs in Fujian Province—directly across the Taiwan Strait. Satellite imagery suggests these assets are optimized for a cross-strait operation. Chinese fighter jets and warships have entered Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) at unprecedented levels. The question of whether China will invade Taiwan is no longer hypothetical but a matter of timing and risk calculus. While Beijing continues to deny aggressive intent, the evidence suggests a sustained and deliberate military buildup with the intent to compel reunification—if not peacefully, then by force. Hegseth's warning reflects not alarmism, but a sober assessment of escalating realities. These indicators—military drills, strategic deployments, political rhetoric, and infrastructure mobilization—align with historical precedents for pre-invasion posturing. The international community must take this threat seriously. Strengthening deterrence, improving intelligence sharing, and reinforcing Taiwan's self-defense capabilities are critical to avoiding a regional catastrophe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, a confidential report by the U.N. nuclear watchdog said Saturday. In a separate report, the agency called on Tehran to urgently change course and comply with its years-long probe. The report comes at a sensitive time, as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to reach a deal with Tehran to limit its nuclear program. The two sides have held several rounds of talks, so far without agreement. That's an increase of 133.8 kilograms (294.9 pounds) — or almost 50% — since the IAEA's last report in February. The 60% enriched material is a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. A report in February put this stockpile level at 274.8 kilograms (605.8 pounds). There was no immediate comment from Tehran on the new IAEA report. The IAEA report, a quarterly, also estimated that as of May 17, Iran's overall stockpile of enriched uranium — which includes uranium enriched to lower levels — stood at 9,247.6 kilograms (20,387.4 pounds). Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. Iranian officials have increasingly suggested that Tehran could pursue an atomic bomb. Israel said Saturday's report was a clear warning sign that “Iran is totally determined to complete its nuclear weapons program,” according to a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. It said IAEA's report “strongly reinforces what Israel has been saying for years — the purpose of Iran's nuclear program is not peaceful.” It also added that Iran's level of enrichment “has no civilian justification whatsoever” and appealed on the international community to “act now to stop Iran.” Grossi said Saturday that he “reiterates his urgent call upon Iran to cooperate fully and effectively” with the IAEA's years long investigation into uranium traces discovered at several sites in Iran. In this so-called “comprehensive report,” the IAEA said that Iran's cooperation with the agency has “been less than satisfactory” when it comes to uranium traces discovered by IAEA inspectors at several locations in Iran that Tehran has failed to declare as nuclear sites. One of the sites became known publicly in 2018 after Netanyahu revealed it at the United Nations and called it a clandestine nuclear warehouse hidden at a rug-cleaning plant. Iran denied this but in 2019 IAEA inspectors detected the presence of manmade uranium particles there. After initially blocking IAEA access, inspectors were able to collect samples in 2020 from two other locations where they also detected the presence of manmade uranium particles. A fourth undeclared location named as Lavisan-Shian is also part of the IAEA probe but IAEA inspectors never visited the site because it was razed and demolished by Iran after 2003. Saturday's comprehensive report could be a basis for possible further steps by European nations, leading to a potential escalation in tensions between Iran and the West. European countries could move to trigger snap-back sanctions against Iran that were lifted under the original 2015 nuclear deal ahead of October, when the deal formally expires. On Thursday, senior Iranian officials dismissed speculation about an imminent nuclear deal with the United States, emphasizing that any agreement must fully lift sanctions and allow the country's nuclear program to continue. Trump said on Friday that he still thinks a deal could be completed in the “not too distant future.” Associated Press writer Melanie Lidman in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As President Donald Trump enters just his 132nd day in office on Saturday, our White House Report Card finds him in a good position. The courts gave him wins on his tariff and immigration policy, inflation surprised by ticking down, he heralded a series of DOGE victories in bidding Elon Musk farewell, and he's getting ready to head the first modern-day military parade in Washington on June 14. His approval rating is holding, more people than ever believe the country is heading in the right direction, and two-thirds of voters, even those who supported former Vice President Kamala Harris, like his America-first focus. “The president's doing well,” said Democratic pollster John Zogby, one of our co-graders, though he also cited Trump's inability to nail down some really big victories. A Washington Post headline today, for example, screamed: “Trump plows ahead after one big, bad, sometimes ugly week full of setbacks.” At the Washington Examiner, Editor Hugo Gurdon and chief political correspondent Byron York headlined their video chat, “Trump's accomplishments getting the public's approval.” In this week's report card, conservative Jed Babbin graded Trump's week a B-minus, noting that the “big, beautiful bill” faces hurdles in the Senate. It was a pretty good week for President Donald Trump with his “Liberation Day” tariffs being struck down and quickly revived by the courts, his “One big, beautiful bill” — now OBBB — having a rocky time in Congress, and Canada asking to be covered by his Golden Dome missile defense. Trump said Canada could get Golden Dome coverage — if it became the 51st state. The “Liberation Day” tariffs were struck down by a lower court and then restored at least for a while by the federal circuit. Meanwhile, Trump threatened iPhone tariffs if they're not made in the U.S. They'll probably amend it to death, and Trump will be stuck celebrating a bill that doesn't accomplish much of his agenda. The success of his second term depends on this bill and next year's budget reconciliation. He and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have made progress by terminating student visa applications. Which brings us to the wit and wisdom of Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA). He said that AOC is the reason we have directions on shampoo bottles. Elon Musk quit the DOGE pseudo-agency which has done yeoman's work on cutting government waste. The hope is that DOGE will continue cutting and slashing away. Meanwhile, Trump has, at long last, realized that Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn't want to make peace in Ukraine. This week witnessed the end of two bromances — one with fellow autocrat Vladimir Putin, the other with fellow narcissist Elon Musk. Trump issued several pardons, including one for a former Chicago gang leader running a drug trade from prison, the other for reality stars Todd and Julie Chrisley. He and his sons have enriched themselves following a private dinner with cryptocurrency leaders at his New Jersey golf club. One federal court blocked his policy of global tariffs, calling it “illegal,” but another paused that pause, allowing the president to continue for now. A judge blocked Trump's efforts to stop Harvard University from enrolling foreign students. One poll seems to show Trump losing ground among young men. But a new poll by John Zogby Strategies does not find that at all. What's more, the president is in a dead heat or even slightly ahead against any of several possible Democratic contenders in 2028. Jed Babbin is a Washington Examiner contributor and former deputy undersecretary of defense in the administration of former President George H.W.

Britain's Jack Draper celebrates beating Brazil's Joao Fonseca during their third round match of the French Tennis Open, at the Roland-Garros stadium, in Paris, Saturday, May 31, 2025. PARIS (AP) — When Jannik Sinner's opponent in the French Open's third round finally won a single game Saturday, the Court Suzanne-Lenglen crowd responded with a standing ovation. Sinner was simply too good on this day, extending his Grand Slam winning streak to 17 matches and looking very much like the No. Sinner dominated Jiri Lehecka 6-0, 6-1, 6-2 in just 1 hour, 34 minutes, the quickest men's match at Roland-Garros this year and, measured by games lost, the most lopsided victory at a major tournament of Sinner's career. “We try to improve,” Sinner said. Check out some of the numbers: Sinner delivered 31 winners and made only nine unforced errors. He accumulated 18 break points, converting seven, and faced just one, which he saved. The first 11 games went Sinner's way. When Sinner missed a return wide, making the score 6-0, 5-1 after 55 minutes of action, Lehecka raised his arm and pumped his fist in a bit of sarcastic celebration. The fans went wild, rising out of their seats and clapping and shouting, eliciting a smile from Lehecka. The 23-year-old from the Czech Republic is ranked 34th and has been a Grand Slam quarterfinalist. But he was completely overmatched by Sinner, who has won the past two major championships — at the U.S. Open in September and the Australian Open in January — and is now the owner of an unbeaten run at the sport's most important tournaments that's been surpassed this century only by a trio of guys by the names of Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Sinner's bid for a first French Open title, and fourth Slam trophy overall, will continue Monday, when he'll face No. 17 Andrey Rublev for a quarterfinal berth. Rublev advanced when his opponent, No. 14 Arthur Fils, withdrew from the tournament because a stress fracture in his lower back. 3-seeded American who was the runner-up at the U.S. Open, came back to eliminate 2019 French Open finalist and 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 and reach the fourth round. Another American, 70th-ranked Hailey Baptiste, made it into Week 2 at a major for the first time by beating Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 7-6 (4), 6-1 and will play Madison Keys or Sofia Kenin next. 6 Mirra Andreeva, an 18-year-old Russian who reached the semifinals a year ago, advanced to a fourth-round showdown against No. American qualifier Ethan Quinn, the 2023 NCAA champion for the University of Georgia, played his second consecutive five-setter and was beaten by Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands 4-6, 6-1, 6-7 (2), 6-1, 6-4. Griekspoor came into the day 0-4 in third-round matches at majors. Griekspoor next meets 2024 runner-up Alexander Zverev, while No. 5 Jack Draper takes on Alexander Bublik. 1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka and the two defending champions, Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz, are all scheduled to appear in the fourth round Sunday. Shelton faces Alcaraz, Paul goes up against No. 25 Alexei Popyrin and Tiafoe meets Daniel Altmaier.</p>

EXCLUSIVE - The United States will not participate in a conference next month in New York City hosted by France and Saudi Arabia aimed at promoting the recognition of a Palestinian state, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview in Jerusalem earlier this week. "It's incredibly inappropriate in the midst of a war that Israel is dealing with to go out and present something that I think increasingly Israelis are steadfast against. They are welcome to do that, but they are not welcome to impose that kind of pressure on a sovereign nation. And I find it revolting that they think they have the right to do such a thing. Huckabee, commenting on recently reported tensions between the two close allies, noted there may be disagreements between the Trump administration and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, but there should be no fear of a rupture in bilateral ties. "I don't think pro-Israel Americans need to be concerned that there's some rift between the United States and Israel. Are there sometimes differences of opinion on the next steps in the war in Gaza, getting the hostages home, or maybe to avoid an all-out war with Iran? "But as far as the relationship between Israel and the U.S., that is not in any way at risk, nor is it in any way splintered or fractured. It's critically important that the United States maintains its partnership—and I use that word very deliberately—it's not a friendship, it's not an alliance, it's a partnership, which means we are yoked together in our intelligence sharing, military — so many ways in which our nations are linked inseparably." President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meet at the White House in Washington, D.C., Feb. 4, 2025. On talks between Washington and Tehran, the ambassador described the Islamic Republic as "one of the if not the greatest, threats to world peace," warning that it poses a serious and immediate existential threat not only to Israel, but also to several Gulf nations and ultimately to the United States. "It's just important when people tell you over and over for 46 years they plan to kill you, you might want to start taking them seriously." Nevertheless, Huckabee expressed hope that ongoing nuclear negotiations between the two nations would be successful and avoid any kind of military conflict. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee speaks to Fox News Digital during an interview at the American embassy in Jerusalem, Israel. "But when diplomacy fails, the soldiers show up," he said. "I find it hard to believe the Iranians, after all these years of pushing towards a nuclear device that is weaponized, would suddenly come to their senses and say we've changed. But if they don't, the president has been incredibly clear that Iran is not going to have a nuclear weapon." On Israel's ongoing war against Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip, he emphasized that the suffering could end immediately—if Hamas chooses to act. "All of us are hoping and praying that Hamas will finally give up all the hostages and release them, and then they will depart Gaza for good. If they do these two things, this is over," he said. What they did was unthinkable, horrific, heinous, uncivilized, savage behavior." He noted that President Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted that Hamas has no future in Gaza. "Israel has been clear that they are willing to put them on airplanes and fly them out in exile, they have a way out, but they don't have a way in. They have to go, and all hostages living and dead have to be returned," he added. Huckabee expressed hope that this would happen immediately. Speaking to Fox News Digital on Thursday, he said of the hostages, "This pin that I wear on my lapel—one of the happiest days of my life will be when I can take this pin off and permanently put it away, never to wear it again, because that means all of the hostages have come home," he said. (L-R) Foreign Affairs Minister of Bahrain Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani, Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu, U.S. President Donald Trump, and Foreign Affairs Minister of the United Arab Emirates Abdullah bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan participate in the signing ceremony of the Abraham Accords on the South Lawn of the White House on September 15, 2020, in Washington, D.C. Witnessed by President Trump, Prime Minister Netanyahu signed a peace deal with the UAE and a declaration of intent to make peace with Bahrain. He also expressed confidence in the prospect of expanding the Abraham Accords, forged during Trump's first term, which normalized relations between Israel and four Arab states: the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco. While not naming new countries considering joining, Huckabee said, "There are a number of nations that now realize that having enmity with Israel is meaningless," he said. "It is a delicate path for some countries; they can't go faster than their people are willing to go and accept … but there is a great atmosphere and possibility that we will see some dramatic changes and big additions to the Abraham Accords."

Workers stand inside UR Energy's Lost Creek uranium production facility in Sweetwater County, Wyo, Monday, Dec. 9, 2013. SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — In the southeastern Utah desert famous for red rock arches and canyon labyrinths, the long-dormant uranium mining industry is looking to revive under President Donald Trump. Normally it would have taken months, if not years, for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to review plans to reopen a project like Anfield Energy's Velvet-Wood mine 35 miles (56 kilometers) south of Moab. But the bureau's regulators green-lit the project in just 11 days under a “national energy emergency” Trump has declared that allows expedited environmental reviews for energy projects. More permits and approvals will be needed, plus site work to get the mine operating again. If that happens, it would mean revival — and jobs — to an industry that locally has been moribund since the Ronald Reagan era. “President Trump has made it clear that our energy security is national security,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in announcing the fast-tracking policy in April. “These emergency procedures reflect our unwavering commitment to protecting both.” Trump's order also applies to oil, gas, coal, biofuel and hydropower projects — but not renewable energy — on federal lands. Global uranium prices are double what they were at a low point seven years ago and, for the past year, the U.S. has banned uranium imports from Russia due to that country's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. More domestic mining would address a major imbalance. More than two-thirds of U.S. imports come from the world's top three uranium-mining countries: Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan. Less government regulation won't spur more U.S. uranium mining by itself. And while spot-market prices are up from several years ago, they're down about a third from their recent high in early 2024. While some new uranium mining and processing projects have been announced, their number falls far short of a surge. That suggests prices need to rise — and stay there — for a true industry revival, said John Uhrie, a former uranium executive who now works in the cement industry. “Until the price goes up dramatically, you're not going to be able to actually put these places into operation,” Uhrie said. Anfield Energy, a Canadian company, also looks to reopen the Shootaring Canyon uranium mill in southern Utah near Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. And just off U.S. 191 in southeastern Utah is a hub of the industry, Uranium Fuels' White Mesa mill, the country's only uranium mill still in operation. These days, Moab is a desert tourism hot spot bustling with outdoor enthusiasts. But the town of 5,200 has a deeper history with uranium. Nods to Moab's post-World War II mining heyday can been spotted around town — the Atomic Hair Salon isn't just named for its blowout hairstyles. The decades-long, $1 billion U.S. Department of Energy effort to haul off toxic tailings that were leaching into the Colorado River upstream from the Grand Canyon and Lake Mead should wrap up within five more years. That mill's polluting legacy makes some Moab residents wary of restarting uranium mining and processing, especially after the Trump administration cut short their ability to weigh in on the Velvet-Wood mine plans. “This was a process I would have been involved in,” said Sarah Fields, director of the local group Uranium Watch. Grand Canyon Trust, a group critical of the Pinyon Plain mine as a danger to groundwater, points out that the U.S. nuclear industry isn't at risk of losing access to uranium. With Bill Gates' support, TerraPower is building a 345-megawatt sodium-cooled fast reactor outside Kemmerer in western Wyoming that could, in theory, meet demand for carbon-free power at lower costs and with less construction time than conventional reactor units. Meanwhile, about 40% of uranium mined in the U.S. in 2024 came from four Wyoming “in-situ” mines that use wells to dissolve uranium in underground deposits and pump it to the surface without having to dig big holes or send miners underground. None — as yet — came from mines in Utah. Powering electric cars and computing technology will require more electricity in the years ahead. Meeting the demand for nuclear fuel domestically is another matter. Even if mining increases, it's not clear that U.S. capacity to turn the ore into fuel would keep pace, said Uhrie, the former uranium mining executive.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However good any given plan is, it often produces losers and – even in the best of cases – some short-term pain. And repeatedly now as President Donald Trump has launched multiple massive overhauls, prominent Republicans have learned that the hard way. Appearing at a town hall on Friday, Ernst was pressed on cuts to Medicaid – the health care program for low-income Americans – in House Republicans' budget plan. (That's not the full story, of course; the Congressional Budget Office recently projected that House Republicans' changes to Medicaid, including work requirements for some recipients, would leave 7.6 million Americans uninsured by 2034.) But Ernst decided to go in a different direction. “Well, we all are going to die,” said Ernst, who's facing reelection in 2026. The senator and her office argued Friday that Republicans are in fact trying to “strengthen” Medicaid. A spokesman said: “There's only two certainties in life: death and taxes, and she's working to ease the burden of both by fighting to keep more of Iowans' hard-earned tax dollars in their own pockets and ensuring their benefits are protected from waste, fraud, and abuse.” Those that meet the eligibility requirements for Medicaid, we will protect … them.” As a contrast, she cited an oft-invoked GOP claim that 1.4 million undocumented immigrants are receiving Medicaid benefits. In other words, however bad Ernst's answer was, it might just be that there's not a good answer to be given. It's a political minefield that even some Trump allies like Steve Bannon have warned their party about. And indeed, Democrats quickly leapt to highlight Ernst as the epitome of an uncaring, Medicaid-busting Republican. But Ernst is not the first to wander into this kind of territory. Repeatedly in recent weeks, prominent Republicans who have been asked to account for the pains caused by Trump's bold plans have stumbled into similar territory. Trump himself has repeatedly talked about how the price increases created by his tariffs might mean people have to buy fewer dolls for little girls. Conservative Daily Wire founder Ben Shapiro called Trump's comments “a tremendous commercial for Democrats” and urged Trump to avoid language that minimized the impacts of inflation. Back in March, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick addressed the administration's chaotic changes to the Social Security system by claiming that only “fraudsters” would complain about missing a Social Security check. “Let's say Social Security didn't send out their checks this month. My mother-in-law, who's 94 – she wouldn't call and complain,” Lutnick said. A fraudster always makes the loudest noise – screaming, yelling and complaining.” It's logical to assume that Lutnick's mother-in-law wouldn't complain, given her son-in-law is a billionaire. But according to the Social Security Administration, more than 1 in 10 seniors rely on the program for at least 90% of their income. But they are certainly fodder for Democrats to argue that Trump is pursuing a rather haphazard and callous overhaul of the American economy. It's the kind of thing Bannon warns about in cautioning Republicans against Medicaid cuts. And if the early evidence is any indication, it's going to result in plenty of awkward defenses in the future.</p>

Sperm from a single donor in Europe has reportedly been used to conceive at least 67 pregnancies, although the donor carried a rare cancer-causing mutation. The donor's mutation has been linked to cancer diagnoses in 10 of these children, according to a report by The Guardian. The case was brought to light after two families separately contacted their fertility clinics after their children's cancer diagnoses were linked to a rare genetic variant called TP53. Researcher Dr. Edwige Kasper (not pictured) advocates for a European limit on the number of births or families for a single donor. The genetic variant reportedly would not have been detectable through standard screening, and the donor is said to currently be in good health. "The identified mutation is one that could not have been detected by the screening methods we use in accordance with regulations." Dr Edwige Kasper, a biologist at Rouen University Hospital in France, presented this case at the European Society of Human Genetics' annual conference in Milan last week, commenting on the need for a European limit on the number of births or families for a single donor. "But this is the abnormal dissemination of genetic disease. Kasper analyzed the mutation in her lab, concluding that it was most likely cancer-causing and that children born from this donor should "receive genetic counseling." The research-turned-investigation tracked down 67 children from 46 families in eight European countries. The 10 who had been diagnosed with cancer reportedly included cases of leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In a statement sent to Fox News Digital, the European Sperm Bank stated that donor-assisted reproduction "generally remains a significantly safer alternative" than reproduction without genetic screening. The bank added that sperm donors undergo a "comprehensive health screening," which includes an in-depth medical examination, a review of the donor's family medical history and "extensive" testing for genetic and infectious diseases. "However, it's not possible to rule out all risks — and, in this particular case, the identified mutation is one that could not have been detected by the screening methods we use in accordance with regulations and would require specialized genetic testing," the group noted. of corporate communications at the European Sperm Bank, expressed to Fox News Digital that they are "deeply affected by this case." "The donor has been thoroughly tested even beyond the required standards, but preventative genetic screening is reaching its limits here," she said. "Every human being has about 20,000 genes, and it is scientifically simply not possible to detect disease-causing mutations in a person's gene pool if you don't know what you are looking for." Eggs and sperm are stored in a liquid nitrogen tank at the Fertility Center Berlin. Budtz noted that the European Sperm Bank welcomes "continued dialogue" regarding setting an "internationally binding family limit," which they have advocated for "on several occasions, also at EU level." "This is also why, in addition to complying with national pregnancy limits, we have proactively implemented our own international limit of 75 families per donor," she added. In the U.S., there is no official legal limit on how many sperm donations one man can make. However, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) recommends that donors are limited to 25 live births within each population area of 800,000 people. "Institutions, clinics and sperm banks should maintain sufficient records to allow a limit to be set for the number of pregnancies for which a given donor is responsible," the ASRM states on its website. "Limiting donor vials is an important part of the process." The U.S. Federal Drug Administration requires that all sperm donors undergo a physical exam, complete a questionnaire, provide their medical history, and undergo screenings for infectious diseases at an FDA-approved lab. The U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) requires that all sperm donors undergo a physical exam, complete a questionnaire, provide their medical history, and undergo screenings for infectious diseases at an FDA-approved lab. "Legal consultation and laws may vary by state," the organization notes. At California Cryobank, donors must be tested for infectious diseases, undergo genetic screening, get a psychological assessment and criminal background check, and receive screening for the Zika virus, according to the bank's website.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Patrons sit near the illuminated logo of a newly opened Stars Coffee cafe in the former location of a Starbucks in Moscow, Russia, on Jan. 24, 2023. But after more than three years of war, President Donald Trump has held out the prospect of restoring U.S.-Russia trade if there's ever a peace settlement. And Russian President Vladimir Putin has said foreign companies could come back under some circumstances. “Russia wants to do largescale TRADE with the United States when this catastrophic ‘bloodbath' is over, and I agree,” Trump said in a statement after a phone call with Putin. “There is a tremendous opportunity for Russia to create massive amounts of jobs and wealth. The president then shifted his tone toward Putin after heavy drone and missile attacks on Kyiv, saying Putin “has gone absolutely crazy” and threatening new sanctions. That and recent comments from Putin warning Western companies against reclaiming their former stakes seemed to reflect reality more accurately — that it's not going to be a smooth process for businesses going back into Russia. And with Putin escalating attacks and holding on to territory demands Ukraine likely isn't going to accept, a peace deal seems distant indeed. Here are factors that could deter U.S. companies from ever going back: Russian law classifies Ukraine's allies as “unfriendly states” and imposes severe restrictions on businesses from more than 50 countries. Foreign owners' votes on boards of directors can be legally disregarded. And there's little sign any of that is going to happen. While the Russian government has talked in general about companies coming back, “there's no specific evidence of any one company saying that they are ready to come back,” said Chris Weafer, CEO of Macro-Advisory Ltd. consultancy. Russia's actions and legal changes have left “long-lasting damage” to its business environment, says Elina Ribakova, non-resident senior fellow at the Bruegel research institute in Brussels. She said a return of U.S. businesses is “not very likely.” In a meeting at the Kremlin on May 26 to mark Russian Entrepreneurs Day, Putin said that Russia needed to throttle large tech firms such as Zoom and Microsoft, which had restricted their services in Russia after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, so that domestic tech companies could thrive instead. We provided the most favorable conditions possible for their work here, in our market, and they are trying to strangle us.” Asked for comment, McDonald's referred to their 2022 statement that “ownership of the business in Russia is no longer tenable.” On top of Russia's difficult business environment, the economy is likely to stagnate due to lack of investment in sectors other than the military, economists say. “Only Belarus offers an equally lousy combination of growth and risk.” Most of the opportunity to make money is related to military production, and it's unlikely U.S. companies would work with the Russian military-industrial complex, said Ribakova. “It's not clear where exactly one could plug in and expect outsize returns that would compensate for this negative investment environment.” Some companies, including Renault and Ford Motor Co., left with repurchase agreements letting them buy back their stakes years later if conditions change. But given Russia's unsteady legal environment, that's tough to count on. “There's a lot of uncertainty as to how those buyback auctions will be enforced.” Multinational oil companies were among those who suffered losses leaving Russia, so it's an open question whether they would want to try again even given Russia's vast oil and gas reserves. US.. major ExxonMobil saw its stake in the Sakhalin oil project unilaterally terminated and wrote off $3.4 billion. But they would have to face new requirements on establishing local presence and investment, Weafer said. The Yale School of Management's Chief Executive Leadership Institute lists some two dozen U.S. companies still doing business in Russia, while some 100 more have cut back by halting new investments. But the EU is still slapping new rounds of sanctions on Russia.</p>

The liberal presidential candidate Rafal Trzaskowski, front left, waves as he and Polish prime minister Donald Tusk, front right, take part in a march one week ahead of a decisive presidential election in Warsaw, Poland on Sunday, May 25, 2025. WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland is set to hold a presidential runoff election on Sunday between two candidates offering starkly different visions for the country's future. The winner will succeed President Andrzej Duda, a conservative who is finishing his second and final term. The outcome will determine whether Poland embraces a nationalist populist trajectory or pivots more fully toward liberal, pro-European policies. An exit poll by Ipsos will be released when polls close on Sunday at 9 p.m. local time, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. The vote comes amid heightened regional tensions driven by Russia's war in neighboring Ukraine, security concerns across Europe and internal debates about the rule of law. It follows a first round on May 18, in which Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski won more than 31% of the vote and Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian, earned nearly 30%. Nawrocki did much better in the first round than surveys had predicted, indicating that his strength was underestimated. On the other hand, large numbers of Poles abroad have registered to vote in the second round, which could help Trzaskowski. Nawrocki is a 42-year-old historian who was tapped as by the national conservative Law and Justice party despite a lack of political experience or party membership. But this is seen as acting in his favor, as the party, which governed for 2015-2023, seeks to refresh its image before a parliamentary election in 2027. Nawrocki's supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic Polish values. They believe U.S. President Donald Trump's support for him will strengthen Poland's ties with the United States and make the country safer. Trzaskowski, 53, is Warsaw's mayor and a close ally of Tusk. This is his second presidential bid after narrowly losing to Duda in 2020. Supporters credit him with modernizing Warsaw through infrastructure, public transit expansion and cultural investments. He is widely seen as pragmatic and focused on strengthening ties with other European nations. Nawrocki recently received a boost from Trump and other U.S. conservatives, who see the Polish election as part of a global battle between liberal and populist right-wing forces. His campaign has echoed themes popular on the American right, including skepticism toward EU bureaucracy and emphasis on Christian identity. His supporters feel that Trzaskowski, with his pro-EU views, would hand over control of key Polish issues to Paris and Berlin. Nawrocki also has been endorsed by the Trump administration and conservative Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. Many European centrists are rooting for Trzaskowski, seeing in him someone who would defend democracy as it faces pressure from authoritarian forces across the globe. He has received the support of new centrist Romanian President Nicusor Dan — who recently defeated a far-right nationalist. Nawrocki has faced a number of scandals over the past months, but it's not clear that they are hurting him. Many right-wing voters don't believe the allegations and accuse the media of using its power to hurt him, creating what appears to be a rallying effect around him. Polish media have also reported on his connections to gangsters and the world of prostitution. Tusk accused Law and Justice party leader Jarosław Kaczynski of tapping Nawrocki despite questions about his past. “The entire responsibility for this catastrophe falls on you!” Both candidates support continued backing for Ukraine, but to different degrees. Nawrocki believes that Ukraine should never join NATO, while Trzaskowski believes Ukraine should be allowed to join one day when the current war is over. Nawrocki, while less outspoken than his party patrons, is seen as likely to preserve Law and Justice's changes that politicized the courts. Women's rights: Abortion remains a divisive issue in Poland, especially after a near-total ban was imposed under Law and Justice. Nawrocki opposes any liberalization and has campaigned as a defender of traditional conservative values.</p>

China has launched a space probe that will travel to an asteroid near Mars to collect samples and find potential "groundbreaking" results. Tianwen-2 will be aiming for the asteroid 2016 HO3, which is also known as 469219 Kamoʻoalewa, to bring back samples. China's Tianwen-1 probe landed on Mars, but the Tianwen-2 will have a target of asteroid 2016 HO3. The proposed 10-year plan would involve more than just this space mission as China continues to look to expand into space. Zhang Rongqiao, chief designer of the Tianwen-1, told China Central Television he plans to implement the "Tianwen-3" Mars sampling return mission in 2028, while the "Tianwen-4" will head toward Jupiter. The new probe, similar to the Chang 6 mission, will bring home samples from an asteroid close to Mars. Samples from 2016HO3 are due to be returned in about two years. Even if the CNSA is going to distribute these samples to international partners like they have on previous missions, NASA wouldn't be able to receive any samples. A law passed in 2011, known as the Wolf Amendment, restricts NASA from having any cooperation with the CNSA. China also operates the three-person Tiangong, or "Heavenly Palace," space station.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright recounted how Biden-era policies 'strangled' Alaska's energy growth during his address at the Reagan National Economic Forum. SIMI VALLEY, CALIFORNIA – Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said that the Biden administration "strangled" the state of Alaska with restrictions and red tape that was beyond levels imposed on North Korea, Iran and Venezuela combined. "Alaska, a state that has had more sanctions, more restrictions on production of oil and gas in Alaska than everything we did to Iran and Venezuela and North Korea if they produced any combined. You know, the last administration just strangled Alaska. This awesome state of immense natural resources," Wright said from the Reagan National Economic Forum in Simi Valley, California. Wright joined the inaugural Reagan National Economic Forum on Friday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library to celebrate President Donald Trump's executive orders "unleashing American energy" and how the administration is tackling regulations that have prevented the growth of coal and nuclear energy in recent history. Fox News' Maria Bartiromo moderated the energy-focused panel. He pointed to the Gulf of America and Alaska as two key areas for American energy growth, most notably in the Last Frontier State. Former President Joe Biden and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. The idea is we export oil from the north slope of Alaska, comes by pipeline to southern Alaska, and then exported," he said. "We want to build a pipeline from the north slope of Alaska that brings natural gas, not just oil. And then an oil, a natural gas export terminal on the southern coast of Alaska that in six days can sail to Tokyo or Taiwan or Korea. And then down to our allies in East Asia. But it would be awesome and great from a geopolitical stance to have a very short supply chain between a huge industrial American facility and our allies in East Asia." United States Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Fox News' Maria Bartiromo. Wright added that the Gulf of America is a key area of the country to build massive export terminals, where American energy can be exported to foreign nations. But that's where you can build these giant facilities to export it," he said. Katmai National Park in Alaska, United States (Jean-Erick PASQUIER/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images) We have an incredible energy system advantage over China. But we should use it not just to the benefit of our country, but to bring security and tight alliances with our allies as well."
