However, new research has discovered that pterosaurs diversified during the middle of the Jurassic period (201 million to 145 million years ago) and evolved to walk more effectively on four limbs, using their hands and feet. Researchers also matched previously unidentified tracks to specific pterosaur groups, offering a new window into their lives. "Footprints offer a unique opportunity to study pterosaurs in their natural environment," study lead author Robert Smyth, a doctoral researcher at the University of Leicester in the U.K., said in a statement. "They reveal not only where these creatures lived and how they moved, but also offer clues about their behaviour and daily activities in ecosystems that have long since vanished."

However, researchers have uncovered many fossilized pterosaur tracks in recent decades, which represent a unique and untapped resource, according to the study. The problem with pterosaur tracks — or any other extinct animal tracks — is that it's difficult for researchers to know which species or group left them behind.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It will present evidence that suggests ancient serpent or lizard-like aliens came to earth thousands of years ago,” the narrator says. “We'll also present evidence that these ancient aliens are still among us today.” This bizarre narrative echoes a paranoia about shadowy reptilians that has persisted for decades on the absolute fringes of the conspiracy theory movement. When they launched a streaming service last year, President Trump's business partners at the Trump Media and Technology Group announced it would be focused on “news, Christian content, and family friendly programming that is uncancellable by Big Tech.” Yet this supposed haven for young viewers and wholesome Christian fare is also home to “Lizard People: Rulers of Time and Space,” a bizarre hour-long movie that presents claims that there is a race of “serpent-like aliens who created humans and the religious systems used to control them.” As of this writing, Trump's company is marketing this to viewers as a “documentary” — and it's not the only one on their platform filled with shocking statements linking Christianity and other faiths to shadowy, sinister alien conspiracies. These ideas are easy to dismiss as utterly and obviously ridiculous. However, they have a history of attracting troubled believers on the furthest conspiracy fringe. And, while these movies are available on other streaming platforms, in this case the sitting president's nascent media empire is playing a role in the promotion of this extreme content. On Monday and through much of last week, “Lizard People” was listed among the top 10 “most watched” programs on the streaming service. Throughout his second re-election campaign and first hundred days back in office, President Trump has used the Truth Social platform to issue near constant updates including policy pronouncements, personnel announcements, attacks on his political enemies, and even musings on last month's NFL Draft. More recently, as Trump's media empire has made headlines for quickly losing and raising massive sums of cash, it has expanded beyond social networking into other forms of entertainment. Now, the company's ventures include Truth+, the streaming service with multiple films being marketed as documentaries that present wild conspiracy theories, including allegations alien beings are “manipulating world events and are using religion and other means to secretly control humanity.” TPM reached out to TMTG for comment on this surprising fare. Spokeswoman Shannon Devine responded on the company's behalf with a note that wove its own dramatic tale of nefarious plotting by shadowy forces. “Having trafficked in absurd conspiracy theories for years, the partisan hacks at Talking Points Memo, at the behest of their leftwing puppet masters, turn around and demand we censor content on our free-speech platform,” Devine said. TMTG, which is also known as “Trump Media,” has had what one analyst described to the UK's Telegraph newspaper as a “wild ride largely fueled by Donald Trump's political influence.” TMTG was started in 2021 by Trump and two former contestants on his reality show, “The Apprentice.” The relationship between Trump and the other founders eventually descended into lawsuits as the company underwent a merger and prepared to go public. TMTG, which trades under the symbol “DJT,” had its IPO in March 2024 at an $8 billion valuation. Since then, the stock has been on a rollercoaster ride, with prices climbing above $60 after the initial offering before coming down to, as of last week, roughly $25. Other members of the Trump administration have also held shares or served on TMTG's board. TMTG's CEO and chairman is Devin Nunes, who is a former Republican congressman and the current chair of the President's Intelligence Advisory board. TMTG's high value has, thus far, been at odds with steep losses that have dwarfed the company's revenues and totaled over $400 million last year. Stock sales have helped Trump Media offset that and close out 2024 with a $777 million cash reserve. Truth+, which includes a streaming service, launched last August and has been framed by Nunes as central to those efforts. In an April 29 letter to shareholders, Nunes described several potential revenue streams from Truth+, including a crypto token and “premium features” for subscribers like a verified “red check badge.” Nunes reiterated the message that the streaming service would focus on the family and people of faith. “We're assessing various means of monetizing the Truth+ platform, including through advertising and a subscription package with premium content,” Nunes wrote. “Meanwhile, we are continuing our efforts to secure new programming encompassing family-friendly entertainment, documentaries, children's shows, Christian content, and unbiased news broadcasts.” The current slate of streamable video on Truth+ includes rebroadcasts of shows from the right-wing cable network “Real America's Voice” and disgraced former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. Along with partisan news, there are also documentaries, religious programming, and movies including some that are clearly labeled “sci fi, “fantasy,” and “horror.” Among these offerings are multiple shows that veer towards the extreme and conspiratorial. While other Truth+ programming is categorized with entertainment genres, as of this writing, the full description on the service identifies “Lizard People” simply as a “documentary” that poses a tantalizing, troubling question: “Did ancient serpent or Lizard-like aliens come to Earth thousands of years ago to play a role in creating humanity and are they still among us today?” Viewers who are intrigued by this pitch and opt to watch are treated to a brief “WARNING” noting “some parts of this film may be objectionable or offensive and may contain triggers for post traumatic stress disorder, for some viewers.” The disclaimer also declares “the views and opinions expressed in this film are entirely those of its makers.” Other than that, the hour-long show contains no effort to question or downplay any of the shocking claims contained therein. “There is a great deal of evidence to suggest that alien, serpent-like creatures did come to Earth thousands of years ago and created religion, humanity, and continue to control us even now,” the narrator says at one point. The “evidence” presented resists basic scrutiny, as it largely lacks citations and consists of sweeping statements about ancient art, culture, and more modern alien encounters. As “Lizard People” enters its final minutes, footage plays across the screen showing grey alien figures standing over a nearly nude man splayed out on a table surrounded by machinery and tubes prodding into his flesh. This blend of strange imagery, ancient lore, and UFOlogy transitions to the movie's final argument. “In conclusion, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that ancient serpent aliens still visit earth and also use time travel,” the narrator says as the screen goes dark. Variations of the claim that reptilian extraterrestrials have played an influential and sometimes sinister role in world history have been promoted by conspiracy theorists for well over a hundred years. These claims, Strain said, “were later adopted by conspiracists.” ”But what really got it kicked off was a couple things,” he continued. This was picked up by a cult leader named Maurice Doreal.” “He claimed that there was an ancient race of lizard people,” Strain said. Strain described reptilian theories, today, as “more fringe than QAnon.” While Icke denies being an anti-Semite, his past statements — including blaming Jewish groups for COVID — have led him to be banned from multiple countries and internet platforms. The film “Lizard People” does not include focused criticism of Jews. Today, we can easily replace the word ‘gods' with aliens.” Most etymologists explicitly do not agree with this interpretation of the term “Vatican.” Another film on Truth+ delves more specifically into the idea that major religions are part of an extraterrestrial conspiracy. “Conspiracy Chronicles: Dark Underworld” has also been described on the service as a “documentary.” Like “Lizard People,” “Conspiracy Chronicles” is approximately one hour long and seemingly wholly made up of ominous narration set against stock footage and computer animation. And “Conspiracy Chronicles” may be even weirder than the reptilian saga, as it includes a rapidfire smorgasbord of wild claims about everything from Freemasonry to the Jesuits to the Moon, which it contends is actually  “hollowed out” and a “base for aliens.” “There are a few pieces of evidence that suggest that Jesus may have been an alien,” the narrator says before going deeper down the rabbit hole. “And what about other religious originators such as Buddha? So, the next time you see a statue of Buddha, remember that he was an alien.” The array of theories in “Conspiracy Chronicles” also include some suggesting the U.S. government is part of a scheme to cover up both UFOs and “dark ops” experiments. According to the film, this secret laboratory work includes “deliberate production of utterly abominable results such as ape-human embryos and other ungodly biological combinations.” The movie outlines an especially disturbing scenario that it links to a military base in New Mexico. The White House did not respond to a request for comment asking if Trump thinks this content is in line with his company's values. They also didn't answer specific questions about whether Trump believes in “lizard-like” aliens or if the government is covering up UFOs or human-animal breeding experiments. There is other conspiratorial content on Truth+ including a film on the “Illuminati” that was also, as of last week, among the services “most watched” videos. “Lizard People” also cites Alchemy Werks in its credits. The company says on its website that it has produced dozens of movies about aliens that it bills as “reality films.” “Conspiracy Chronicles” additionally describes itself in its credits as a production of American River Media Group, a company that also advertises THC “horse treats.” When TPM reached out to these businesses, we received a call back from a man who identified himself as Charles Thompsen, who is credited as a producer on both “Lizard People” and “Conspiracy Chronicles: Dark Underworld.” The disclaimer on “Lizard People” also states that the filmmakers are “not responsible or liable for any action or inaction by a viewer of this video that is based on the content of this film.” “I don't know how you could take ‘Lizard People' seriously, honestly,” Thompsen said. “We have nothing but support for President Trump,” he said. Thompsen suggested he would talk with Truth+ about having his movies marked as “sci-fi/fantasy.” “Unfortunately, they're not being denoted as such on the Trump Media site and I'm going to have to look into that,” he said. Conspiracy inflected plots are, of course, not uncommon in mainstream entertainment. While it is more rooted in conspiracy theories than any actual evidence, the idea that aliens played a role in early human history has also spawned relatively mainstream content that straddles the line between faux news and tongue-in-cheek entertainment. Strain, the conspiracy theory researcher, suggested it is particularly troubling to see lizard people conspiracy theories advanced on a platform owned by Trump because the presidential association could give these wild ideas momentum. He alluded to instances where Trump has engaged with followers of another popular conspiracy theory, QAnon, online and off. However, at least on Amazon Prime, “Lizard People” is clearly identified as “science fiction.” Other movies on Truth+ similarly come from companies that have dozens of little-known productions and that also make those films available on both free and paid streaming services. The fact these movies are simultaneously available from multiple different sources at widely varying price points brings up another question: How is it cost effective for producers to make dozens and dozens of movies? TPM reached out to Richard Rushfield, a longtime chronicler of Hollywood and columnist at the entertainment industry site The Ankler, to try and understand this business model. There are various production companies who churn out work in bulk, at a low cost, and are then able to monetize even relatively small audiences via the internet or streaming, he said. He described it as a sub-Hollywood “weird internet” world and “very sort of bottom-feedery business.” TPM asked Rushfield if it surprised him to see a company owned by the president engage with this type of content. “Three months ago, it would have,” Rushfield said with a laugh. Hunter deserves serious comp time for watching these things so we dont have to.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Plans are underway to create new AI-powered drones that can fly for much longer than current designs. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Scientists are developing an artificial intelligence (AI) chip the size of a grain of rice that can mimic human brains — and they plan to use it in miniature drones. Although AI can automate monotonous functions, it is resource-intensive and requires large amounts of energy to operate. Drones also require energy for propulsion, navigation, sensing, stabilization and communication. Larger drones can better compensate for AI's energy demands by using an engine, but smaller drones rely on battery power — meaning AI energy demands can reduce flying time from 45 minutes to just four. Their goal is to build a chip the size of a grain of rice with various AI capabilities — including autonomous piloting and object recognition — within three years. To build a more energy-efficient AI chip, the scientists propose using conducting polymer thin films. These are (so far) an underused aspect of neuromorphic computing; this is a computer system that mimics the brain's structure to enable highly efficient information processing. The researchers intend to replicate how neurons learn and make decisions, thereby saving energy by only being used when required, similar to how a human brain uses different parts for different functions. —Tiny AI chip modeled on the human brain set to boost battery life in smart devices Meanwhile, the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center develops AI software and neuromorphic hardware. This technology could allow for greater situational awareness, with applications so far including headsets and robotics. Using technology developed through this research, drones could become more intelligent by integrating conducting polymer material systems that can function like neurons in a brain. If Yi's research project is successful, miniature drones could become increasingly intelligent. An AI system using neuromorphic computing could allow smaller and smarter automated drones to be developed to provide remote monitoring in confined locations, with a much longer flying time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But one particularly startling claim comes from Calvin Parker, a man from Mississippi, the United States, who said he was abducted by aliens not once, but twice. Parker first made headlines in 1973, when he and a companion, Charles Hickson, claimed they were taken aboard a UFO while fishing along the Pascagoula River. While Hickson continued to speak publicly about the event, Parker stayed quiet for years, until a second, voluntary encounter in 1992. In the 1992 meeting, which took place in Baldwin, Louisiana, Parker claimed that the aliens allowed him aboard their craft and shared dire warnings. Parker added that the aliens were collecting crops and soil samples, just as they had in 1973. It was only years later, shortly before his death in 2023, that Parker shared the full story with author Philip Mantle, leading to the release of three books. A video interview, recently uncovered, has now gone viral on the internet, reigniting public interest in his experiences. Parker urged humanity to reflect and change its ways, warning that continued environmental harm such as deforestation and pollution would eventually lead to global catastrophe. “We cannot go on living like this," he said, adding that a small alien creature seemed more intelligent than humans. The Pascagoula encounter remains one of America's most compelling UFO cases, and this newly surfaced interview has added a fresh layer to its enduring mystery.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People who question whether the Earth is round — a fact understood by the ancient Greeks and taught to American children in elementary school — might have been political pariahs a decade ago. A prominent far-right activist who has said, despite years of research and intelligence establishing otherwise, that the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, were an inside job by the U.S. government commemorated the 9/11 anniversary last year alongside President Trump. And Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, pledged the agency's support last month for a fight involving so-called chemtrails, a debunked theory that the white condensation lines streaming behind airplanes are toxic, or could even be used for nefarious purposes. Conspiracy theories that were relegated to random and often anonymous online forums are now being championed or publicly debated by increasingly powerful people. Mr. Trump in particular has embraced, elevated and even appointed to his cabinet people promoting these theories — giving the ideas a persuasive authority and a dangerous proximity to policy. But when people in power have those beliefs, it becomes a serious issue.” Anna Kelly, a spokeswoman for the White House, said in a statement that the mainstream media “has tried and failed to paint President Trump as extreme for his entire political career” and that his agenda was “common sense.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) is interested in finding alien civilisations by detecting signs of their activity. For example, an alien civilisation might construct a thin shell around its host star to harvest energy. Sofia Sheikh, at the SETI Institute, California, and her colleagues are interested in a slightly different question. How far away would Earth be detectable as harbouring an intelligent species, using only the technology we have today? As the authors put it: "One could imagine a spaceship loaded with all of humanity's best modern-day instruments, launched towards a mirror image of Earth – which present-day technosignatures would be detectable first?" Starting with radio emissions, the team calculated that if we beamed a signal with the intention of making contact, we'd be able to detect ourselves from around 12,000 lightyears away. Of course, as attempts such as the 1974 Arecibo message have only been sent in the last century, any signals won't have had time to make it nearly that far yet. Meanwhile, inadvertent leaking of much weaker radio waves into outer space, from mobile phone towers or television broadcasts, would be detectable from four lightyears away – only as far as the nearest star to us. Indicators of Earth's industrial activity in the atmosphere could be detected from slightly further away. While nitrogen dioxide is produced by lightning and some biological processes on Earth, huge amounts of it are also released by human industrial activity: mainly vehicle engines and fossil-fuelled power stations. Light pollution is a big problem for astronomers in built-up areas, so might this urban technosignature be detectable? Many cities are lit by the yellowy light from high-pressure sodium lamps, and this is particularly spectroscopically distinctive. Sheikh and her colleagues conclude that Earth is most detectable through radio emissions. This article appeared in the May 2025 issue of BBC Sky at Night Magazine</p>
