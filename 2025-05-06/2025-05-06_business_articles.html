                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Comcast's spinoff of the majority of its NBCUniversal cable network portfolio will be named Versant, the company said Tuesday, ending a monthslong process to select a new corporate moniker. Versant, which had been called SpinCo until a permanent name was chosen, will own cable networks including USA, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and Golf Channel. It will also house digital assets Fandango, Rotten Tomatoes, GolfNow, GolfPass and SportsEngine. Lazarus said he wants Versant to be viewed as a house of brands, with each asset interacting with users rather than the corporate holding entity. Versant is on track to be spun out from Comcast before the end of 2025, Lazarus confirmed. Lazarus will need to build a Wall Street growth narrative for investors once the company starts trading publicly. That will include making acquisitions to build on the company's core. Some of those transactions may step outside pure media plays, he said. Lazarus cited Golf Channel's acquisition of GolfNow, a tee-time reservation company, as an example of how the brands can move beyond linear TV and streaming to build profitable businesses. "Most people don't know that GolfNow is even part of our company," Lazarus said. "We are not going to be purely a collection of linear and digital media assets." For a brand such as CNBC, that may include acquiring personal finance or fintech platforms, Lazarus said. For MSNBC, Lazarus said he's already had some preliminary conversations about potentially buying podcasts that cater to Democrats. He noted that if the new company were to make such an acquisition the plan wouldn't be to put that programming on air for MSNBC, but to have it operate as a separate business unit, using the cable network as a marketing funnel. Versant will not launch its own streaming service, Lazarus said. It will instead rely on brands to develop their own digital strategies. About 20% of the company's revenue is already digital, Lazarus said. Lazarus said he has little interest in accumulating more debt attached to low-growth assets. If a cable network also had associated businesses that had better growth prospects, that could be more appealing on a case-by-case basis, he said. Versant is also unlikely to acquire TV station groups in the current regulatory environment, Lazarus said. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr told CNBC's Sara Eisen on Monday that national news media companies including NBC are "exercising more and more control" on local TV stations, which he said is not "a good thing for the country." Meetings began in late December, according to people familiar with the process. After a few weeks, the company had more than 1,000 potential names. Employees were told to focus on names that drew upon New York, cable TV or passing references to 30 Rockefeller Center, NBCUniversal's headquarters, said the people. Comcast also hired three marketing agencies to help generate names and cull the list. Lawyers passed through just 43 of the initial names, Lazarus said. Lazarus and his marketing team chose Versant in the past few weeks. The word means "a region of land sloping in one general direction," according to some references. Lazarus joked that an uphill slope reminded him of "a rising stock price." Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dell is pushing for a flatter organizational structure with senior managers being asked to oversee larger teams, Business Insider has learned. "We continually evolve our business so we're set up to deliver the best innovation, value and service to our customers and partners. This includes redefining how work gets done, with a flatter structure and fewer management layers so we can move faster in today's AI-driven world," a Dell spokesperson told BI. BI understands that the reorganization will result in fewer management layers, which is intended to speed up decision-making and empower team members to get stuck into work. Throughout April, divisions across Dell were informed of the changes to their senior management structure. In one such memo, sent on April 29 and seen by BI, Karen Plotkin, senior vice president of client solutions strategy, announced a reorganization of the Client Solutions Group product operations team, including the departure of a longtime manager. Some managers have been let go, while others have had their role classification changed from "M" for manager to "I" for individual contributor, which indicates an employee who has no direct reports, BI understands. Another described the reorg as being focused on "spans and layers," referencing a common term in management for the breadth and depth of an organization's structure. Over the last two years, Dell staff numbers have fallen by 25,000. In August 2024, the company significantly restructured its sales division, which it told workers was necessary to prepare for "the world of AI." As part of the restructuring, Dell laid off workers, though it did not specify how many. The company told workers in January it was "retiring" hybrid work and called employees to return to the office five days a week from March. Dell had a hybrid working culture on place for more than a decade prior to the pandemic, employees have told BI. Are you a Dell employee with insight to share?</p>

Streaming Wars:

The network behind podcasts from Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Meghan Markle will be PodX Group's first US-based acquisition

Swedish audio conglomerate PodX Group AB is acquiring the majority of Lemonada Media, the network behind podcasts like Julia Louis-Dreyfus' Wiser Than Me and Meghan Markle's Confessions of a Female Founder.

The acquisition, which was announced Tuesday in a statement viewed by Bloomberg, marks the European company's first purchase of a US-based network. PodX is spending around $30 million on the deal, according to a person familiar with the terms. A Lemonada representative declined to comment on the figure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These sides played out an astonishing first leg last week, sharing six goals between them. That means it's advantage Inter, as they've racked up a trio of away goals. It doesn't necessarily mean that Simone Inzaghi will be thrilled with the final result, though — his men blew leads of 2-0 and 3-2 to end all square. But last Wednesday was all about teenage sensation Lamine Yamal. At just 17 years old, he already has medals for winning La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the European Championship, and now he has his sights on adding the Champions League to the list. It will be fascinating to see whether this second leg is another high-scoring thriller or a much cagier affair, with a place in the 2025 Champions League final at stake. In this article, you'll read all about your Inter vs. Barcelona live stream options around the world, global TV channels, kickoff time, and ways to watch for free. Unlike in the US, UK, or Canada (see below), there are some countries around the world in which you can watch Inter vs. Barcelona live streams absolutely free. Inter fans in Italy, for example, can see it on the free-to-watch TV8. That's unless you have a VPN (or virtual private network). VPNs kid your laptop, smartphone, or streaming device into thinking it's in another country altogether (for example, the one where you might normally stream the soccer).

As with every other Champions League game this season, Paramount Plus is showing Inter vs. Barcelona live streams online on Tuesday. Subscriptions to the streaming platform cost $8/month or $60 for a whole year. The streamer comes with a seven-day free trial. Upgrading from a monthly to an annual plan will save you more than 1/3 of the cost each year. The Essential tier offers live NFL on CBS games and ad-supported on-demand content. That means it will also be available through OTT cord-cutting services such as Fubo (from $85/month) and DirecTV (from $85/month) — CBS appears on both providers' entry-level plan and upwards. Fubo comes with a seven-day free trial (and $20 off your first month), while DirecTV offers a five-day free trial. Previously known as AT&T TV, DirecTV offers streaming access to a large selection of live channels, including most key networks typically found in traditional cable packages. Fubo is the streaming service for sports fans. Its huge library of channels includes regional and international sports leagues, setting it apart from the competition. This Tuesday night game is showing on Amazon Prime Video in the UK. So if you already subscribe to the online retail giant's subscription service, you can tune in on your laptop, smartphone, or a wide variety of streaming devices. After that, it costs £9/month, which bundles in Amazon's priority delivery service on purchases and all the other Prime membership benefits. You can choose between a commitment-free monthly plan for $35/month or save by taking out an annual subscription that costs either $250 upfront or $25/month in 12 installments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A key Republican senator on Tuesday said he would not support the controversial nomination of Ed Martin, President Donald Trump's pick to be the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, dealing a potentially fatal blow to Martin's chances of winning Senate confirmation. Tillis cited Martin's support for criminal defendants in Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot cases. That riot began after Trump urged a crowd of his supporters to march to the Capitol that day and oppose the confirmation of Joe Biden's election as president. Tillis' decision is likely to doom Martin's hope of his nomination even being reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which Tillis is a member. With Tillis as a "no" vote, the best that Martin could hope for from that committee is a tie vote of 11-11, with Republicans and Democrats evenly split. A tie vote would fail to report Martin out of the committee and onward to a confirmation vote in the full Senate. Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, on Monday night did not add Martin's nomination to the panel's business meeting agenda, which signaled his chance of being approved was in peril. "I want to put people on the agenda that I can help the president be successful in his nominees and that's all I can say at this point," Grassley told reporters Tuesday. "I want the president's nominees to be successful, and that means we put on people that have the votes." Martin currently is serving as interim U.S. attorney for D.C., but his term will expire on May 20. "But let me be very clear," Tillis said, "Mr. Martin did a good job of explaining the one area that I think he's probably right, that there were some people that were over-prosecuted, but there were some [200 to 300 of them] that should have never gotten a pardon," Tillis said. "If Mr. Martin were being put forth as a U.S. attorney for any district except the district where Jan. 6 happened, the protest happened, I'd probably support him, but not in this district." Tillis said that he believed that any member of the crowd on Jan. 6 outside the Capitol who breached the perimeter should have been in prison for some period of time. "Whether it's 30 days or three years is debatable, but I have no tolerance for anybody who entered the building on January the sixth, and that's probably where most of the friction was," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Friedrich Merz was elected as Germany's chancellor in a second-round parliamentary vote on Tuesday, after failing to secure the necessary support earlier in the day. In the previous vote, only 310 Bundestag members voted for Merz to become chancellor in a highly unexpected and unprecedented setback. Hours of uncertainty then followed as it was unclear when a second vote would take place, and what the outcome would be. Following the successful vote, Merz was officially appointed chancellor by German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Tuesday afternoon. It was 0.4% lower by 3:22 p.m. London time. Merz had been widely expected to become the leader of Europe's largest economy following Germany's federal election in February. They are expected to form a coalition government with the center-left Social Democratic Party, which placed third in the election. The parties on Monday formally signed their coalition agreement following weeks of negotiations that began soon after the election. The agreement outlines plans for policies including migration, changes to tax rules for individuals and businesses, and social security measures such as the minimum wage. It is set to include designated Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil, incoming Economy Minister Katherina Reiche and designated Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul. Germany's new chancellor, now 69, has spent his life between politics and business. His has also held senior positions at various major corporations, including BlackRock Germany, and served on the boards of EY Germany and the Deutsche Börse. His CDU affiliation began when he was still in school, Merz has said. In the early 2000s, much of his political career was marked by a rivalry with former CDU Chancellor Angela Merkel. Her rise through the ranks has been linked to Merz taking a step back from politics for several years. He will now take over Germany's leadership at a precarious time for the country, which is grappling with a sluggish, stagnating economy, internal tensions around migration, tensions with the U.S. over trade policy, and geopolitical challenges such as the Russia-Ukraine war. Expectations are also high due to the recent fiscal package that stemmed from the CDU-CSU/SPD coalition negotiations. It included changes to long-standing debt rules, as well as a major investment fund targeting infrastructure and climate. This was a "strong and impressive start" for the new government, but "unfortunately, what has since followed has been a series of slip-ups and sometimes clumsy political moves," Carsten Brzeski, ING's global head of macro, said in a note Tuesday. "Looking ahead, today's events are a painful reminder that it will be hard for the incoming government to fulfil the high expectations regarding investments and reforms," he added. "Friedrich Merz and his government now face the monumental challenge of restoring economic strength while keeping everyone in their own parties aligned."

The new app, Fizz, lets multiple users contribute to one order, pay for their own items and have them delivered together with a flat $5 fee.

Instacart is launching a new, Gen-Z focused app for group orders of drinks and party snacks, expanding its core delivery business beyond grocery hauls.  

The new app, Fizz, lets multiple users contribute to one order, pay for their own items and have them delivered together with a flat $5 fee. That's a lower rate than the $7.99 fee that the main Instacart app currently charges non-subscribers. Fizz will also have a rewards program for brands to provide in-app discounts to shoppers and is partnering with invites app Partiful, allowing users to add a link for group orders into an events page for upcoming gatherings.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla is having a nightmare in Europe — and now it's been overtaken by two Chinese rivals in the UK. Telsa's tally is well behind arch rival BYD, which sold 2,511 cars in the UK in April, or a 650% increase. The disastrous performance meant it was also left in the dust by lesser-known Chinese brands Jaecoo and Omoda. They are both owned by Chinese conglomerate Chery and sold 1,053 and 910 vehicles respectively in April, according to data from the SMMT trade body, despite only launching in the UK last year. Jaecoo and Omoda offer a mix of EVs, hybrids, and gas-powered cars in the UK, unlike Tesla, which only sells EVs. However, getting lapped by two virtually unknown Chinese rivals is a sign of just how much trouble Tesla faces in Europe, its third-biggest market. The billionaire's endorsement of the far-right German party AfD and position in the Trump administration has sparked protests in several European cities, with Tesla vehicles and showrooms also being hit by vandalism and suspected arson. Tesla also faces renewed EV competition from legacy brands such as Volkswagen and Chinese automakers, which are expanding aggressively in Europe despite tariffs imposed by the European Union last year. Tesla's European brand crisis shows little sign of abating. In the UK, Tesla has started offering up to two years of free supercharging for some Model Y models as it looks to arrest the slide.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam are cracking down on methods used by Chinese exporters to avoid President Donald Trump's high tariffs. Jaya Wen, a professor in the Business, Government, and the International Economy Unit at Harvard Business School, told Business Insider that if goods undergo a "substantial transformation" in the intermediate country, they merit a change in their place of origin. Wen, who researches trade re-routing, said value-added production has increased since tariffs were introduced and is a legitimate method for Chinese companies to avoid tariffs. But illegal rerouting and relabeling through a third country, where no value is added to products, also appears to be taking place, she said. This was happening before the current wave of tariffs, she said. The White House's senior trade advisor, Peter Navarro, raised concerns about this process in an interview with CNBC in April, saying that Chinese businesses were "trans-shipping to Vietnam to evade tariffs." "We are seeing a sharp increase in recent cases where our country is used as a bypass for products to avoid different tariffs and restrictions because of the US government's trade policy changes," the agency said in a press briefing, according to Reuters. Korea's Customs Agency said it would launch a special investigation unit to crack down on the practice, and would enhance intelligence sharing with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Similar crackdowns on counterfeit product labelling are taking place in Thailand and Vietnam, If US Customs and Border Protection begins to question legitimate country-of-origin shipments coming out of third countries based on fears that the goods may be Chinese, this could put shipments from those countries at risk of much higher scrutiny, Segrist told BI. Asian countries are also cracking down in an effort to prevent further sanctions, negotiate lower tariffs on their own imports, and secure trade deals with the US, both experts told BI. Thailand and Vietnam have become manufacturing hot spots for many multinational companies diversifying their operations outside China. Heightened surveillance of illegal re-labelling would also help boost local manufacturers, Wen said.</p>

Consumers who raced to replace their vehicles because of Trump's trade policies risk a costly financial hangover that could last years.

Bliss Bednar's 2023 Volkswagen Atlas was running just fine. Sure, it wasn't the fanciest car she'd ever owned, but with home renovations to plan and rising construction costs already threatening her remodeling budget, the retired teacher in central Texas planned to stick with the three-row SUV for the foreseeable future. 

Then President Donald Trump outlined 25% tariffs on auto imports, and she joined the millions of Americans racing to dealerships to snap up new models before the higher levies drive up prices by thousands of dollars.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There aren't a lot of people who can say they've beaten Apple. Tim Sweeney may have just earned a spot in that club. Sweeney is the CEO of Epic Games — best known as the company behind Fortnite — and he won what may be a very meaningful court victory last week, by forcing a significant change in the way Apple runs its App Store. Apple is going to appeal that ruling (and Sweeney is in a parallel fight with Google over its app store rules). But if the ruling stays put, it means the five years and the enormous amount of money Sweeney says he spent and sacrificed by challenging Apple and its CEO, Tim Cook, will have paid off. Explaining why Apple's App Store rules are so important — to both Apple and the developers who complain about them — can be a drag, though I keep trying. I wanted to hear Sweeney's take on it directly because he's made the fight a core part of his job for half a decade. And I also wanted to know when I'll be able to play Fortnite on my iPhone — something I haven't been able to do since 2020, when Sweeney first started fighting with Apple. (I've asked Apple for comment, but they haven't expanded on the statement they made last week expressing their disappointment and plans to appeal.) You can hear our entire discussion over on my Channels podcast. The following is an edited excerpt of our conversation. Peter Kafka: Why was last week's ruling important to you and Epic? And why should a normal person care about it? And our futures are going to be ever more connected there. So the freedom for consumers and developers to do business together is of paramount importance. If you have one monopoly gatekeeper who dictates what people are allowed to play, see, hear — and takes exorbitant fees from every transaction that everybody does online — we're going to have a much less free world than the one that we grew up in. I started programming back on an Apple II when I was 13: You turn the computer on, you get a BASIC programming prompt. Those digital freedoms are essential to the future. Neither of those is done through Apple because in both cases, neither of those companies wanted to pay Apple's fees. But I use Spotify and Netflix on my phone. I could maybe argue that it's a bit of a hassle for me to have to deal with Netflix on a website instead of directly through its iOS app. But it doesn't really seem like it's a sort of life and death situation for me or any of the companies involved. They have one tier of rules for what they call reader apps, which are basically apps operated by multi-hundred-billion-dollar companies — Amazon Video, Netflix, Spotify, and a number of others. Apple lets those apps do business outside of the app. And they've previously obstructed those developers from telling users about the better deals [you could get by going to those sites directly]. But even with that restriction, which is now being taken away, it seemed like life was OK for me, life was OK for Netflix, life was OK for Apple. Apple forced all games, all social media apps, and everything else, to only do business through their app. So Apple imposed a rule on all game developers, saying if you sell anything for your game anywhere in the world on any platform, then you must sell it on iOS, and you must use our payment method, and you must pay us 30% if your revenue is greater than a million dollars. So the game developers did not have a choice, and everything there was just marked up 30%. The second-order effect is that you can expect if Apple continues to offer such a horrible deal, that everybody's going to move away and steer their customers towards iOS payments on the web. So I would hope that Apple would step up and compete, give developers a much better deal than 30%, and actually engage in competition. But whether Apple chooses to compete or not, the court has enabled developers to make the choice for themselves. Apple says they're going to comply with the judge's ruling, but they're also going to appeal it. So it's possible the rules get changed again. Do you think a meaningful number of developers are willing to take advantage of this window, knowing that it can get shut down? It's 30% of revenue, so all major developers will support alternative payments. Spotify was the first major app I saw that already has done it. You guys were kicked off the platform in 2020 for violating Apple's rules. There's nothing in the judge's ruling that says Apple has to reinstate Fortnite on iOS. How do you imagine Fortnite will come back to iOS? Epic has a valid [Apple] developer account in good standing. Our subsidiary Epic Games Sweden opened up an account in order to distribute Fortnite in the European Union. Our dealings with Apple on that account have been managed by their developer relations team, who have been cordial. Do you feel confident that I will be able to play Fortnite on my iPhone later this week? I would be very surprised — well, I wouldn't be terribly surprised if we had a bug that took a day or two more to fix — but I would be very surprised if Apple decided to brave the geopolitical storm of blocking a major app from iOS. How much has it cost you to engage in this five-year legal fight? But if you look at lost revenue, that's another story. We can't predict exactly how much we would have made on iOS, but in the two years that we were on the platform, Fortnite had made about $300 million on iOS. I'm thinking of the future players you would have gotten, who didn't get exposed to the game because they don't have access to it via their phone. They're all getting to it via their phone. Those are all people who could have played Fortnite for the last five years. You're much more likely to play a game or use a social network if your friends are there. So Apple cutting off Epic from access to the entire iOS audience, that not only affects the players that are directly denied access to Fortnite, it also affects all of their friends who might have played Fortnite more or might have played Fortnite but didn't, because their friends weren't able to play. So you could easily imagine that there's been a billion dollars or more of impact to Epic in this time. I think freedom cannot be purchased at too dear a price. And if it doesn't change, then you're just going to have Apple and Google extracting all of the profit from all apps forever. And there will be no proper digital economy. I understand the logic and emotion behind that argument. On the other hand: You're running a for-profit company. They put a lot of money into you. Did they come to you at any point in the last five years and say, "Tim, I know that freedom cannot be purchased at too dear a price. On the other hand, I've invested a lot of money in you because you're a games company, and your game is banned from mobile phones. Other than one investor who exited Epic right quick, everybody has stood by us, because nobody invested in Epic because they want to make a 30% profit flipping the stock. They have invested in [us], believe in our vision, believe in our potential, and believe that if we succeed in building the metaverse and growing Fortnite from a game into an ecosystem, into an open platform serving literally billions of players, that it will totally have been worth it. Do you imagine this is the rest of your professional life — running a business, coding, and then also having legal fights with platforms? Epic is one of the few companies in the industry that's positioned in a way that really forces us to fight for everybody. And I don't feel bad about this. I put a lot of brain power into coding over the years. I put a lot of brain power into figuring out how to defeat the monopolies that are blocking us. What good is coding if you don't have the right to release your product?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The yellow metal is likely to continue outperforming silver thanks to strong demand from central banks, which have been snapping up gold since 2022. "The price divergence began after the freezing of Russian reserves, which triggered a fivefold increase in central bank gold buying — a shift that does not extend to the more ample and less precious silver," Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note on Monday. Gold and silver prices are closely linked with the gold-silver price ratio, which measures the ounces of silver needed to buy one ounce of gold and historically trades in a 45-80 range. However, the ratio has broken out of this range since 2022 and is now around 102, which means that more silver is now required to buy an ounce of gold. "Central banks broke a 40-year correlation," wrote the Goldman analysts. They don't expect silver prices to catch up with the gold rally as higher central bank gold demand has structurally lifted the gold-silver price ratio. While the war in Ukraine has lifted gold prices, prices have been on a tear since early 2024 as investors piled into haven assets. Gold prices hit a historic high above $3,500 per ounce on April 22. Its price is around 28% higher this year to date. The spot gold price was around $3,370 per ounce at 3:08 a.m. Meanwhile, a boom in China's solar panel production has also slowed, putting pressure on the prices of silver, which is used in its manufacturing. "With Chinese solar production now slowing amid oversupply, high recession risk, and central bank gold buying remaining strong in 2025, we expect gold to continue outglittering silver," the analysts wrote. Goldman's year-end forecast for gold prices is $3,700 per ounce.</p>
