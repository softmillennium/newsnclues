            Israel struck multiple sites in Yemen's capital Sanaa Tuesday, including the main airport, which the Israeli military said has now been “fully” disabled.
    


            “A short while ago, IDF (Israel Defense Forces) fighter jets struck and dismantled Houthi terrorist infrastructure at the main airport in Sanaa, fully disabling the airport,” the Israeli military said in a statement Tuesday, adding that several major power stations in the Sanaa area were also hit.
    


            Israel's military earlier issued an evacuation warning for Yemen's international airport in Sanaa, marking the first time the IDF has put out such a notification in Yemen, more than 1,000 miles from Israel.
    


            Houthi leader Mohammed al-Bukhaiti vowed retaliation against the Israelis, telling Al Arabiya TV on Tuesday: “We will meet escalation with escalation, and there are still multiple targets within the Zionist entity, sensitive targets, which will cost the Zionist entity large losses.”

Israel strikes targets in Yemen for the first time in months, a day after Houthis attack Tel Aviv airport



            Tuesday's attacks mark a significant escalation between the Iran-backed Houthis and the Israeli military that has spiraled rapidly in recent days.
    


            On Sunday, a Houthi ballistic missile penetrated Israel's air defenses and hit near Ben Gurion international airport after several attempts to intercept the missile failed, the IDF said. The strike appears to be the first time Israel's international airport has been successfully targeted by the group.
    


            The Iran-backed Houthi rebel group claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was in response to Israel's offensive in Gaza, and warned it would “impose a comprehensive air blockade” on Israel by “repeatedly targeting airports,” especially Ben Gurion. It called on international airlines to plan accordingly and cancel all scheduled flights to Israeli airports.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu then vowed retaliation.
    


            “We acted before, we will act in the future too. I can't elaborate all of that. The US, in coordination with us, is also operating against them. It's not ‘one and done' - but there will be hits,” he said in a video address posted on social media Sunday.
    


            In a post to X later, he also promised a response to Iran: “Israel will respond to the Houthi attack against our main airport AND, at a time and place of our choosing, to their Iranian terror masters.”
    


            That retaliation began on Monday when Israeli forces carried out a series of strikes against the port in Hodeidah – Yemen's second largest – and a nearby cement factory, killing at least one person and injuring another 35 people, according to the Houthi-run Ministry of Health.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that 20 of its fighter jets took part in that mission – the first Israeli strikes in Yemen in months – hitting dozens of Houthi targets in Hodeidah and surrounding areas. The Houthi-run TV channel Al-Masirah said the port of Hodeidah was hit at least six times and confirmed the attack on the nearby cement factory.
    


            The IDF claimed the Hodeidah seaport “is used for the transfer of Iranian weapons, equipment for military purposes, and other terror-related need(s).”
    


            Israel struck Sanaa international airport in December, killing at least three people and injuring 30 others, according to the Houthi-run al-Masirah satellite television network.

Ukrainian drones attacked Moscow for the second consecutive night, temporarily halting flights at four airports in the Russian capital and nine further afield – as it prepares to host a major military parade expected to be attended by world leaders including China's Xi Jinping.
    


            Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said in a Telegram post Tuesday that at least 19 Ukrainian drones were destroyed on their approach to the capital overnight, one night after Russian air defenses shot down four drones near the city.
    


            There were no immediate reports of serious damage or casualties, but debris from downed drones fell on a major highway, Sobyanin said. Flights were suspended as a safety precaution at four of the capital's airports, according to Russian aviation authorities.

Russia's Putin says he hopes there will be no need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine



            The devices launched at Moscow were among 105 Ukrainian drones intercepted across Russia overnight, Russia's defense ministry said on Telegram Tuesday.
    


            The latest Ukrainian attack on the Russian capital comes ahead of Xi's expected arrival in Moscow on Wednesday for a three-day state visit, in which the Chinese leader will take part in Friday's May 9 Victory Day celebrations, according to a Kremlin statement Sunday.
    


            Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Vietnam's President To Lam and Belarussian leader Aleksandr Lukashenko are among 29 leaders expected to attend, according to Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov. North Korea will send an ambassador to Moscow – and India, Nicaragua and South Africa will be represented by high-level delegations, he said.
    


            Victory Day is the most significant day in Russian President Vladimir Putin's calendar, as he has long used it to rally public support and demonstrate the country's military prowess.
    


             Thousands of people are expected to line the streets of Moscow's Red Square on Friday in an exhibition of patriotism marking the Soviet Union's role in defeating Nazi Germany and commemorating the more than 25 million Soviet soldiers and civilians who died during World War II.
    


            Kyiv called on international allies not to send troops to Russia's Victory Day celebrations in Moscow, warning that participation would amount to “sharing responsibility for the blood of Ukrainian children, civilians, and military personnel.”
    


            “The participation of foreign military personnel in this event is unacceptable and will be regarded by Ukraine as a desecration of the memory of the victory over Nazism,” the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Tuesday.
    


            Troops from 13 countries are set to take part in the parade, Russia's presidential aid said. The parade will involve marching units from Azerbaijan, Vietnam, China, and Egypt among others, Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.
    


            Russian authorities have already pulled scheduled celebrations in parts of the country – just hours after the Ukrainian salvo overnight. In the south, there will be no Victory Parade in Sevastopol, occupied Crimea, or in the city of Krasnador, according to local governors.
    


            Mikhail Razvozhaev, the Russian-backed head of Sevastopol, announced commemorations were canceled “for security reasons,” in a decision mandated by Russia's defense ministry. Similarly, Kuban Veniamin Kondratyev, the head of Krasnador, warned such celebrations posed “a big risk.”
    


            “An air threat is announced almost every night. Of course, we cannot risk the residents of Krasnodar, those who come to the parade, the participants in the parade,” said Kondratyev.
    


            Putin last month declared a unilateral three-day ceasefire in Ukraine to coincide with the May 9 celebrations based on what he called “humanitarian considerations,” prompting skepticism in Kyiv.
    


            Following the attacks on Tuesday, Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, accused Kyiv of “continuing the war,” insisting that the Easter truce “is still relevant.” But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly criticized the three-day ceasefire, saying he was only ready to sign up for a longer truce of at least 30 days.
    


            Since April 29, when Putin called for the Victory Day truce, the Ukrainian army has accused Moscow of launching around 1,856 attacks along the expansive frontlines. In that time, Russian attacks have killed at least 44 civilians and injured another 335 in Ukraine, according to a CNN tally of figures from local authorities and emergency services.
    


            A Russian missile strike on the outskirts of Sumy in central Ukraine on Tuesday killed one child and injured six people, most of whom were also children, Sumy's regional military administration said. One child was left in “extremely serious condition,” the authorities added.
    


            Meanwhile, the White House renewed calls for a “permanent ceasefire” as the Trump administration ramps up pressure on Moscow and Kyiv to agree to a deal to end the war. But those negotiations have largely stalled.
    


            In a message to dignitaries traveling to Russia for the Victory Day celebrations, the Ukrainian leader warned that Kyiv “cannot be responsible for what happens on the territory of the Russian Federation,” due to the ongoing conflict.
    


            Kyiv won't be “playing games to create a pleasant atmosphere to allow for Putin's exit from isolation on 9 May,” Zelensky said in his nightly address on Saturday.
    


            In response, Russia's foreign ministry said his comments amounted to a threat.
    


            Zelensky has demanded answers from China in recent weeks, after he revealed that two Chinese fighters had been captured by Ukraine in early April and claimed there were “many more” in Russia's ranks.
    


            Beijing denied any involvement and repeated previous calls for Chinese citizens to “refrain from participating in military actions of any party.”
    


            Kyiv has increasingly turned to drones to level the playing field with Russia, which boasts superior manpower and resources. On Saturday, Ukraine claimed it shot down a Russian Su-30 fighter jet in the Black Sea using a seaborne drone for the first time.
    


            Meanwhile, a Ukrainian official told CNN the country's military retains a presence inside Russia's Kursk, days after Moscow said it had completely recaptured the western region following a months-long incursion by Kyiv's forces.

Follow:


            Air traffic controllers who lost communication with aircraft at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, leading to hundreds of delays for more than a week, are taking special government leave for traumatic situations to recover from the stress.
    


            The controllers in Philadelphia Terminal Radar Approach Control, which coordinates planes arriving at Newark, “temporarily lost radar and communications with the aircraft under their control, unable to see, hear, or talk to them,” on Monday April 28, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said in a statement shared with CNN.
    


            The connectivity between Federal Aviation Administration radar and the frequencies that air traffic controllers use to manage planes flying in and out of the airport “completely failed,” a source with knowledge of the situation said.
    


            At least five FAA employees took 45 days of leave as a result of the incident, sources tell CNN.
    


            On Monday, the FAA acknowledged that the agency's “antiquated air traffic control system” is affecting its workforce.
    


            “Some controllers at the Philadelphia TRACON who work Newark arrivals and departures have taken time off to recover from the stress of multiple recent outages,” the FAA said in a statement. The FAA also said it is updating its automated system to be more resilient and is working to safeguard telecommunications equipment in the New York area.
    


            The staffing chaos has pushed into an eighth, and unprecedented day, resulting in delays and cancellations for thousands of customers.
    


            “While we cannot quickly replace (the controllers) due to this highly specialized profession, we continue to train controllers who will eventually be assigned to this busy airspace,” the FAA said.

What we know about the massive staffing shortage that has caused 7 days of major delays at Newark Airport



            On Monday, 160 flights into or out of the airport were canceled and 375 flights delayed, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.



            The FAA has indicated it expects more delays at the airport.
    


            Air traffic controllers were essentially left in the dark last week when they lost access to the systems that help them guide planes into Newark Liberty International Airport, air traffic control audio obtained by CNN shows.
    


            “Approach, are you there?,” one pilot asks an air traffic controller who stopped responding.
    


            The audio, recorded by the website LiveATC.net, shows the tense moments the FAA says led some controllers to take trauma leave.
    


            About 15 to 20 flights were being controlled by Newark airport controllers when communications and radar went down Monday, according to an analysis by flight tracking site Flightradar24.
    


            A recording from a United Airlines flight flying to Newark from New Orleans captured the five radio attempts the pilot made to the controller before getting a response.
    


            “United 1951, how do you hear me?” the controller finally asks. “I got you loud and clear, United 1951,” the pilot responds.
    


            Later, contact is lost with another United flight flying from Charleston, South Carolina, to Newark.
    


            “We lost our radar so just stay on the arrival and maintain 6000 (feet),” the controller said.
    


            The same flight, traveling at hundreds of miles an hour, eventually returns to the radar, but does not show up in an accurate position, according to the audio.
    


            “United 674, I see the turn. I think our radar might be a couple seconds behind,” the controller reports as he tries to sort out the equipment problems.
    


            A smaller aircraft trying to enter airspace around a major airport also elicited some clear frustration from the approach controller.
    


            “When you get close to the river, give the towers a call,” the controller told the pilot.
    


            “Do I have bravo clearance?,” the pilot asks.
    


            “No, you do not have a bravo clearance. We lost our radar and it's not working correctly. Radar service terminates… If you want a bravo clearance, you can just call the tower when you get closer,” the controller said.
    


            “Okay, I'll wait for that frequency from you,” the pilot responds.
    


            “No.. look up the tower frequencies. We don't have a radar, so I don't know where you are,” the approach controller says.
    


            The nationwide air traffic controller staffing shortage was compounded by over 20% of FAA controllers who “walked off the job” at Newark Airport last week, according to a statement Friday by United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby. Many of the affected flights have been through United Airlines.
    


            The control facility responsible for traffic at Newark has been “chronically understaffed for years,” Kirby added.
    


            The comments angered some in the aviation community who say the employees involved are entitled to take leave.
    


            “The controllers did not “walk off the job” as it has been reported by the media,” the controller's union responded Monday. “Due to the event, the controllers took absence under the Federal Employees Compensation Act. This program covers all federal employees that are physically injured or experience a traumatic event on the job.”
    


            “The controllers didn't just walk off the job, they were traumatized, their equipment failed,” the source with knowledge of the situation said. “It's written in the regulations if they experience a traumatic event, they can take time off to go see a psychiatrist…the people working that day did that.”
    


            The situation at the Newark airport is “ridiculous,” according to Peter Goelz, former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board.
    


            “We have a very safe system, but anytime it's stressed like this, where you have controllers who are feeling under maximum pressure, it impacts safety – and people have a right to be concerned,” Goelz told CNN.

            “I'm not sure I'd want to fly out of Newark over the next week or 10 days. I might choose an alternate route, because you cannot expect humans to function at their highest level for sustained periods of time with this kind of pressure on them,” he added.
    


            Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said Friday the outdated air traffic control system used by the airport contributed to the delays, pledging to implement a new system – one that could take three to four years to get working. 



            Sen. Chuck Schumer, from New York, said Monday he directed the Department of Transportation's Office of Inspector General to look into the issues at Newark before they extend across the nation.
    


            “The chaos at Newark could very well be a harbinger if issues like these aren't fixed, and if the FAA can't get real solutions off the ground,” Schumer said.
    


            Schumer cited firings at the FAA due to cuts by the Trump administration and said the agency has had little response to his concerns.
    


            “We're here because the FAA is really a mess. This mess needs a real forensic look, a deep look into it,” Schumer said, adding that Newark's air traffic controllers have long warned the FAA of problems at the airport.

Brazil has agreed in principle to play a soccer friendly against Russia this autumn, local media reported Monday. Russia is currently barred from official FIFA and UEFA tournaments due to the Ukraine conflict. 

Journalist Galvao Bueno of the Band.com.br news outlet revealed a letter from the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) dated August 2024, confirming that it had accepted an invitation from the Russian Football Union (RFU) to play a match in Moscow in 2025.

The confederation has reportedly informed Russian officials that the Brazilian national team would be available during the FIFA international match windows from October 6 to 14 and November 10 to 18.

“We believe that collaboration between the Brazilian Football Confederation and the Russian Football Union will be fundamental to strengthening ties and further enhancing the global football ecosystem,” the CBF reportedly wrote.

“The national team board will be mobilized to work towards holding the aforementioned game,” it added.

The correspondence signals Brazil's willingness to schedule the match, although no official agreement has been reached. Details including dates, venues, and logistical arrangements reportedly remain under discussion.

Both federations are expected to continue negotiations in the coming months. If confirmed, the match would mark a rare meeting between the two national teams outside of official tournaments. The last time the two teams played each other was in March 2018 ahead of the World Cup in Russia, when Brazil recorded a 3-0 win at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium.

CNN Brazil later reported that it had contacted an unnamed representative of the CBF who denied the organization having any plans to hold a match against Russia in football or any other sport.

The Russian national football team has maintained an unbeaten record since its suspension from international competitions in February 2022. In the past three years, Russia has played a series of friendly matches, securing victories against countries such as Cuba (8–0), Serbia (4–0), Belarus (4–0), Vietnam (3–0), Brunei (11–0), Syria (4–0), Grenada (5–0), and Zambia (5–0).

Despite Russia's ban from official competitions, FIFA has continued to award ranking points for the friendly matches, contributing to Russia's climb to 34th in the world rankings.

Friedrich Merz has been elected as German chancellor following a second Bundestag vote on Tuesday. The leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) had initially fallen six votes short of the required 316-vote threshold earlier in the day, but hours later rallied conservatives and allies in the country's parliament to win 325 votes.

The situation is unprecedented in Germany's post-war history, as no prospective chancellor had previously failed to be voted through by the Bundestag at the first try after securing a coalition agreement.

Merz faced opposition from 289 MPs, many of them from the Left and Green parties, who voted against the 69-year-old.

The second vote took place after four factions agreed to alter parliamentary procedures to avoid delays. According to Politico, urgent closed-door meetings were held in between the votes.

Addressing lawmakers before the second round of voting, CDU/CSU parliamentary group leader Jens Spahn told them that “all of Europe, perhaps even the entire world, is watching this second round of voting.”

“I appeal to everyone to be aware of this special responsibility,” he said, as quoted by broadcaster ARD.

Commenting on Merz's initial failure, one of the leaders of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party faction in the Bundestag, Bernd Baumann, said: “Mr. Merz, you have failed. This is a historic defeat, the likes of which have never been seen in this Bundestag before.”

Green Party politician Renate Kuenast spoke of a “massive loss of authority” for the incoming chancellor, as quoted by broadcaster ZDF.

Left Party parliamentary leader Christian Goerke characterized the situation as a “crushing defeat” for Merz, attributing it to a “truly poor coalition agreement [between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats] that fails to address the major problems facing this country.”

Germany's previous three-way ruling coalition led by the SPD fell apart last November amid internal disputes on spending. The new CDU-SPD coalition has pledged to continue key elements of former Chancellor Olaf Scholz's agenda, including support for Ukraine and unlocking a constitutional debt brake to further boost the military budget.

Moscow must crush Nazism, which has resurfaced in the West in recent years, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu has said.

On Tuesday, ahead of the 80th anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War – Russia's term for the 1941-1945 Soviet war against Nazi Germany – Shoigu emphasized the “enormous price” paid by the USSR in defeating Nazi Germany.

“The multinational people of Russia have learned well the lessons of the Great Patriotic War against fascism,” Shoigu wrote in Rossiyskaya Gazeta. The secretary served as defense minister from 2012 to 2024. He mentioned nearly 27 million combat deaths and 6.5 million additional deaths from starvation and disease during the war against the Nazis.

“Today we are obliged to do everything to defeat the resurrected Nazism,” Shoigu stressed. This imperative has “determined one of the main goals” of Moscow's Ukraine campaign.

“The European elites, who are being incited and patronized by London and Paris, continue to make loud statements about inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia... NATO and the EU have launched programs aimed at preparing the collective West for a direct military conflict with Russia,” he said.

Those “aggressive steps” by the West “are being justified by Russophobic fabrications – in the best traditions of Goebbels' propaganda,” the security chief stressed, referring to Joseph Goebbels, who was Nazi Germany's propaganda minister from 1933 to 1945.

“In order to avoid a repetition of the horrors of the war years, there is an urgent necessity to protect the country from a variety of external and internal threats” by further boosting the military, developing the economy and investing in science and education, he said.

In late April, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who now serves as deputy chairman of the Security Council, also insisted that “a real de-Nazification is required. Nazism needs to be rooted out not only in Ukraine, but in all of Europe.”

MOSCOW, May 6. /TASS/. US officials are aware of Russia's views on Ukraine and understand how they could bring about lasting peace if put into practice, Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov said.

""Our American colleagues are well aware of our position and have an idea how, if we follow through with implementing our position, we can come to a durable peace settlement,"" he told reporters when asked about discussing with the US the conditions for a Ukraine settlement that Russian President Vladimir Putin put forward in June 2024.

""The Americans certainly are aware of what we have proposed and that we have declared a three-day ceasefire in connection with Victory Day celebrations. And probably many people took note that yesterday President Trump praised this step by the Russian leadership,"" the aide said.

Territorial issues have also been actively discussed during the talks, he went on to say.

Russian President Vladimir Putin in June 2024 named the conditions for talks with Ukraine, which included withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from Donbass and Novorossiya, an end to Kiev's aspirations to join NATO, lifting all Western sanctions against Moscow, and Ukraine's commitment to uphold a non-aligned and nuclear-free status and fully respect the rights, freedoms and interests of its Russian-speaking citizens.

The ceasefire that President Vladimir Putin announced for Victory in Europe Day will last from midnight on May 8 to midnight on May 11.

Group demands university cut ties with Boeing over company's military contracts with Israel

More than two dozen pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested on Monday night at the University of Washington in Seattle after they occupied an engineering building and set dumpsters on fire.

The protest group, called Super UW, occupied the Interdisciplinary Engineering Building to demand that the university sever its ties with Boeing, as the aerospace company has military contracts which the students say “are used by Israel in their US-funded genocide of Palestinian people”.

“UW students want Boeing off our campus,” the group wrote on Facebook on Monday.

Boeing notably gave the school a $10m donation to build the Interdisciplinary Engineering Building in 2022.

Officers with Washington state patrol's rapid deployment teams along with campus police and Seattle police broke up the occupation of the university's engineering building, a Washington state patrol spokesperson told CNN.

A university spokesperson, Victor Balta, told NBC News that university police and other law enforcement officers began clearing away crowds of supporters, many wearing black masks, outside the building at 10.30pm before police moved inside at 11pm.

“About 30 individuals who occupied the building were arrested on charges of trespassing, property destruction and disorderly conduct, and conspiracy to commit all three, will be referred to the King county prosecutor's office,” Balta said in a statement to the network.

He said that the group had created a “dangerous environment” in and around the building, blocked entrances by stacking furniture and setting fire to two dumpsters on the street outside.

The university's statement also said it “strongly condemns this illegal building occupation” and an unspecified “antisemitic statement” made by a suspended student group. The university added that it would “not be intimidated by this offensive and destructive behavior”.

Super UW said on its Facebook page that it had “launched an occupation of the new Boeing-funded engineering building” and was staging the protest over the aviation company's defense contracts and arms sales to Israel.

“We're hoping to remove the influence of Boeing and other manufacturing companies from our educational space, period, and we're hoping to expose the repressive tactics of the university,” a Super UW spokesperson, Eric Horford, told KOMO News.

The group is calling for the building to be renamed the Shaban al-Dalou Building, after a teenage engineering student who was killed by a bomb in Gaza.

In a post on Medium, Super UW said: “We are taking this building amidst the current and renewed wave of the student Intifada, following the uprising of student action for Palestine after the heroic victory of Al-Aqsa Flood on October 7th, which shattered the illusion of zionist-imperialist domination and brought Palestine to the forefront for all justice-loving people of the world.”

The group notes that they believe the UW administration “prioritizes their ability to rake in blood money over the demands of their students and workers”.

The Super UW protest is a sign that US universities could see a repeat of last year's pro-Palestinian encampments and building-occupations. The University of Washington was among the colleges with a pro-Palestinian encampment in place for weeks before the university's president called for it to be dismantled after antisemitic and violent graffiti was discovered on various buildings.

On social media on Monday night, the UW Jewish Alumni Association expressed disappointment that university leadership failed to prevent the demonstration, posting on X that it was “an absolute disgrace. UW leadership has risked everyone's safety rather than get a grip on its antisemitism problem”.

The Guardian has contacted the University of Washington for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Republican Jefferson Griffin had sought to throw out votes for Democrat Allison Riggs in supreme court election

North Carolina election officials must certify Democrat Allison Riggs as the winner of a state supreme court election, a federal judge ruled on Monday, a significant development in the only race that has remained undecided from last year.

Riggs, who currently sits on the court, defeated Jefferson Griffin, a Republican appellate judge, by 734 votes last November. Multiple recounts confirmed her win. But after election day, Griffin challenged more than 60,000 votes, mostly in Democratic-leaning counties, saying that election officials had wrongly allowed them to count.

Richard Myers II, a district judge and Trump appointee, agreed with Riggs and said that Griffin was essentially trying to change the rules of the election after election day.

“This case concerns whether the federal constitution permits a state to alter the rules of an election after the fact and apply those changes retroactively to only a select group of voters, and in so doing treat those voters differently than other similarly situated individuals. This case is also about whether a state may redefine its class of eligible voters but offer no process to those who may have been misclassified as ineligible,” Myers wrote in his opinion. “To this court, the answer to each of those questions is ‘no.'”

Griffin's challenges focused on three groups of voters. The largest was tens of thousands of people whose voter records lacked a driver's license number or the last four digits of their social security numbers. A few thousand more were overseas voters who had failed to provide photo ID. There was also a smaller group of voters who were labeled “never residents” – people who had turned 18 while living abroad and claimed North Carolina as their residence.

It was clear from the start that many of the challenged voters were eligible to cast a ballot. Riggs' parents were among those challenged. The Guardian and other news outlets spoke to several challenged “never residents” who said they were temporarily abroad, had lived in North Carolina, and were confused about why they were being challenged.

What was seen as a quixotic effort quickly turned into concern for voting advocates when the North Carolina court of appeals ruled in Griffin's favor, saying more than 60,000 voters had to prove their eligibility. The North Carolina supreme court later narrowed the number of ballots at issue to around 1,500.

The fact that courts were even willing to entertain a post-election effort to challenge rules set well in advance of voting, experts said, is an alarming development and may lay out a playbook to overturn future elections.

“You establish the rules before the game. You don't change them after the game is done,” Myers wrote. He also paused his opinion for seven days to give Griffin a chance to appeal. Griffin's campaign told the Associated Press Monday night they were evaluating the ruling.

“Today, we won. I'm proud to continue upholding the constitution and the rule of law as North Carolina's supreme court justice,” Riggs said in a statement.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Mik Bartels is among those fearful of Trump's America, partly because their research includes 20 words on US government's list of banned terms

Queer Australians are axing travel plans to Washington DC's World Pride festival, as Donald Trump's executive orders targeting LGBTQ+ rights leads to fears of discrimination at the US border and potential attacks.

People skipping the international event join other Australians and travellers from around the world who are avoiding the US after Trump's inauguration and a string of controversial policies enacted in the early months of his second term as president.

Washington DC will host the 2025 edition of World Pride from 23 May to 8 June, with tens of thousands of domestic and international tourists originally expected to travel to the capital for events including a parade, concerts, street festivals, lectures and a human rights conference.

When Sydney hosted World Pride in 2023, more than 1 million people attended the festival, with about 100,000 tourists visiting the city, including 21,000 international travellers who injected more than $228m into the New South Wales economy, an analysis from Deloitte found.

The Guardian was contacted by LGBTQ+ Australians, including trans and same-sex couples, who had scheduled trips to the US to incorporate World Pride but in recent weeks ditched their plans.

Mik Bartels is among them. The University of Canberra student, who is examining LGBTIQ+ discrimination in healthcare for their PhD, was offered a scholarship that covered travel expenses to attend World Pride's human rights conference.

Bartels had attended the conference at the 2023 World Pride in Sydney and found it valuable for their research.

“It brings together people from all disciplines – community leaders, scholars, academics from around the world,” they said.

“I got so much out of the 2023 conference, so when I got the offer, I thought this would be amazing to travel to Washington DC. So I accepted it. I hadn't really read many reports of people being detained or denied entry at the time.”

However, after an Equality Australia travel warning and recent reports of discrimination in the US, they decided to withdraw their acceptance of the funded trip.

“Given my appearance as identifiably queer, my academic profile being centred on LGBTIQ+ discrimination, and my online presence where I am openly queer, I was not confident that I would be able to get into the US without being detained,” they said.

“I'm conscious of the US government's list of banned words in academic research – my own research includes about 20 of those words.

“I'm also hyper aware of how I present myself online. I'm quite visibly queer in how I look and dress. I realised there was a very real possibility of being detained. I didn't withdraw the acceptance lightly, but felt [that] for my own safety, I needed to.”

Beyond the risk of discrimination from customs and border officials, Bartels said their partner had raised safety concerns about World Pride itself.

“Even though Washington DC is quite progressive, you can be worried about gun violence at any queer event in the US.”

Missing out on the conference and World Pride was a “double whammy”, Bartels said.

“When you spend a lot of your life building the confidence to carve out a space for yourself, that becomes a lifelong journey. Opportunities to celebrate that journey and to demonstrate my relationship proudly are rare, so for this to be taken away, it can feel like a bit of a kick in the guts,” Bartels said.

“The irony of not being able to attend a human rights conference due to a possible lack of human rights is not lost on me.”

Reports of valid passport and visa holders being denied entry, and of mistreatment at the hands of customs and border officials, prompted Equality Australia in April to issue a specific warning to gender-diverse Australians and those with a record of LGBTQ+ or political activism.

Equality Australia said travelling to the US carried “serious risks” of being denied entry, being mistreated or even being detained.

World Pride organisers announced this week they were relocating events set to be hosted at the Kennedy Center – which Donald Trump took over this year – to an alternative venue because of “inhospitable” conditions, including the banning of drag performances.

A Canberra trans woman, who asked not to be named, is another Australian who has cancelled their trip to the US.

She and her wife had planned a holiday in California, where her wife grew up, before going to Washington DC for World Pride.

“Even though the specific locations we were planning to visit are known for being progressive, the risks that I face as a trans woman in being arbitrarily turned back or detained at the border are too high,” she said.

“Considering the hostile actions the Trump administration is taking against queer and gender-diverse Americans, unfortunately we don't envisage being able to visit any time soon.”

Other Australian families have cancelled holidays to the US because of fears of how border officials would process their gay or trans children, they told Guardian Australia in response to a reader callout in April.

The cancellations follow reports of gender-diverse and politically active travellers facing discrimination at the hands of US border officials.

Separately, an Australian man with a working visa who was detained and deported on returning to the US, alleged border officials called him “retarded” and boasted “Trump is back in town”.

An award-winning Australian comedian cancelled a planned trip to the US after receiving legal advice that she could be stopped at the border due to her previous jokes about the Trump administration.

Australian academics are refusing to attend US conferences for fear of being detained.

Equality Australia legal adviser Heather Corkhill said Australians, particularly trans and gender-diverse travellers, “need to think carefully” before booking tickets to World Pride.

“While Washington DC is generally more progressive, travellers to World Pride should be mindful that visiting other states comes with risks like being arrested or fined for using the ‘wrong' bathroom,” Corkhill said

“Even in the capitol and its office buildings, trans people are unable to use single sex bathrooms and changing rooms that align with who they are.”

The president and CEO of Washington DC's official tourism arm Destination DC, Elliott Ferguson, said millions of people were expected to attend World Pride 2025.

He acknowledged the reports of some people abandoning trips but insisted they were in the minority.

“We have not heard of any widespread cancellations and remain optimistic that turnout will be strong,” Ferguson said, speaking on behalf of World Pride 2025.

“Our message is you are safe and welcome here. The concerns of the community are exactly why World Pride is so important. Washington DC is a place to advocate and make your voice heard.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Zhao Xintong on Monday was hailed as snooker's “new superstar” after winning the World Championship with an 18-12 victory over Mark Williams that heralded a Chinese revolution in the sport.

Zhao's fairy-tale triumph at Sheffield's Crucible was a watershed moment for snooker.

The sport's popularity in China has grown exponentially over the past two decades, helped by the success of Ding Junhui, who served as an inspiration for Zhao.

Ding lost the 2016 World Championship final to Mark Selby, but Zhao ended the wait for a first Asian male world snooker champion with a sublime display against three-time winner Williams.

The 28-year-old is just the third qualifier to win the title since the World Championship moved to the Crucible in 1977.

Zhao is the youngest world champion since Shaun Murphy, who won aged 22 in 2005.

He is the first amateur player to win the world title, having lost his tour card in January 2023 for his part in a match-fixing scandal.

That controversy threatened to derail Zhao's promising career when he was hit with a 20-month ban. Zhao accepted charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on matches himself in a controversy that led to 10 Chinese players being punished, with life bans for Liang Wenbo and Li Hang, but his road to redemption reached an emotional climax at the Crucible, just 10 minutes walk from his home in Sheffield.

Williams first won the tournament 25 years ago and was bidding to become snooker's oldest world champion aged 50.

With that wealth of experience, he is better placed than most to rank Zhao against the current generation and he believes the left-hander could be set to dominate for years to come.

“There's a new superstar of the game. He just strolls around the table and pots balls from anywhere as if he doesn't have a care in the world,” Williams said. “Xintong is going to be a national hero now. He'll be on the front page of every news outlet going and I'm sure there are Chinese companies ready to throw zillions at him. It's great for our sport to have someone at the top who is so attacking and so young.”

Nicknamed “The Cyclone,” Zhao had been touted as Ding's heir apparent since winning the UK Championship in 2021, with Ronnie O'Sullivan and Jimmy White singling him out as a future star.

He has come of age in spectacular style.

Zhao crushed O'Sullivan in the semi-finals and his win over Williams was his 47th in 49 matches since he returned from suspension in the inauspicious surroundings of a Q Tour event in Sofia in September last year.

“It's like a dream. I can't believe it,” Zhao said. “There was big pressure and I was a bit nervous because I knew I couldn't miss. I knew he could come back so quickly so I had to concentrate and be very careful.”

Zhao is to start next season at No. 11 in the world rankings.

He has joined nine other Chinese players in the world's top 32, with England the only nation with more ranked in the top echelons.

John Parrott, who won the world title in 1991, believes Zhao's win would serve as the spark for a golden era for Chinese snooker.

China already has a national snooker academy in Beijing training the nation's best young players and millions of Chinese fans were said to have tuned into the final to witness Zhao's coronation.

“You think about how many snooker clubs they've got in China, clubs with hundreds of tables, and the population in general. He's going to inspire another wave of players in China and all over Asia,” Parrott said. “There will be more to come. Whether they will be as talented as him, I don't know, because this boy is very talented.”

Steve Davis, a six-time world champion, knows what it takes to dominate the sport after his run in the 1980s and he is convinced Zhao can enjoy a similar reign at the Crucible.

“You see the quality of Zhao Xintong, it's the future and the shape of things to come,” he said. “Every time anybody put anything up to him, he responded. He's a cool customer. He just takes everything in his stride and he's going to be a danger in the future.”

Romania's liberal interior minister Catalin Predoiu was yesterday appointed prime minister, the presidency announced, a day after Marcel Ciolacu's resignation deepened political tumult in the EU nation.

Ciolacu, Romania's pro-EU prime minister, stepped down on Monday after a far-right candidate topped the first round of a tense presidential vote rerun.

Far-right EU critic George Simion topped Sunday's election first round, while the ruling coalition's candidate narrowly lost out to Bucharest's mayor for the second spot.

Ciolacu's resignation comes just two weeks ahead of the presidential runoff on May 18 in the EU and NATO member, which has gained in strategic importance since Russia invaded Ukraine.

Ciolacu said his Social Democrats (PSD) party would leave the ruling coalition, but they are expected to remain in the government on an interim basis until after the election run-off.

Predoiu, 56, is a former justice minister who already served as interim prime minister in 2012.

Predoiu, a lawyer, is also the interim president of the liberals (PNL).

He told reporters on Monday that the liberals have “sworn-in ministers in the government, they will carry out their duties.”

“As long as these mandates are in office, the PNL does its duty,” he said.

In Sunday's first round, Simion, who leads the nationalist AUR party, gained almost 41 percent of votes, double the score of the pro-EU Mayor Nicusor Dan, an independent.

A far-right victory in the second round — closely watched by Brussels and Washington —could mark a shift in the country's foreign policy.

The president represents Romania at EU and NATO summits and can veto EU votes. He also appoints the prime minister and other government posts.

Campaigning on a vow to put Romania first, Simion, a fan of US President Donald Trump, has criticized “Brussels' unelected bureaucrats,” accusing them of having meddled in the Romanian elections.

In December, Romania's constitutional court in a shock move scrapped the presidential ballot after far-right politician Calin Georgescu unexpectedly won the first round.

The annulment followed allegations of Russian interference and a massive TikTok campaign that emerged in favor of Georgescu.

Simion has called the annulment “a coup d'etat.” Georgescu was barred from the rerun, but two major far-right parties decided to back Simion instead.



                                                                                Kehinde Sanni spends his days smoothing out dents and repainting scratched bumpers in a modest autobody shop in Lagos. He has never left Nigeria, yet he speaks glowingly of Burkina Faso military leader Ibrahim Traore.
“Nigeria needs someone like Ibrahim Traore of Burkina Faso. He is doing well for his country,” Sanni said.
His admiration is shaped by a steady stream of viral videos, memes and social media posts — many misleading or outright false — portraying Traore as a fearless reformer who defied Western powers and reclaimed his country's dignity.

Reform, led by anti-immigrant firebrand Nigel Farage, won the by-election in Runcorn and Helsby in northwest England by just six votes, as it picked up gains in other localities, including one mayoralty.

13:35 JST, May 6, 2025

THE HAGUE — Yuji Iwasawa, 70, who was elected president of The Hague-based International Court of Justice in March, recently gave an interview to The Yomiuri Shimbun. He told the newspaper that he wants to contribute to the promotion of the rule of law in the international community by helping to peacefully resolve the conflicts that continually arise around the world.

The Tokyo native, who became an ICJ judge in 2018, was elected president by his peers, the 15 judges of the court, to fill the post for the remainder of the term of his predecessor, Nawaf Salam. Salam resigned in January to become prime minister of Lebanon.

In 2022, the ICJ issued provisional measures regarding the Russian aggression in Ukraine, including ordering Moscow to suspend its military operations in the country immediately.

The court also issued three provisional measures regarding Israel's military activities in the Gaza Strip last year, including an order for an immediate halt to attacks on the southern city of Rafah.

The ICJ has no means of enforcing its judgments or orders, and neither Russia nor Israel has complied with them. However, Iwasawa stressed that the ICJ's judgments are binding. “Legally, countries have to abide by them,” he said.

According to Iwasawa, there have been times when only a single lawsuit would be filed with the ICJ every few years, but at present 25 cases are being contested at the court.

“The content of the cases has also gotten more diverse. They no longer are limited to traditional disputes over national borders and maritime boundaries. Questions of human rights and environmental issues have become more common,” Iwasawa said during the interview on April 7. The number of cases brought before the ICJ has increased because, he said, “The court is trusted, and that's something we as a court should welcome.”

Now, at a time when the international order based on the rule of law is being shaken, the role of the ICJ is attracting attention. Iwasawa said: “Whatever the case, the court's duty is to faithfully interpret and apply international law.”

As an expert on international law, Iwasawa has served as a professor at the University of Tokyo Graduate Schools for Law and Politics and as the chairperson of the U.N. Human Rights Committee, which deals with human rights issues in countries around the globe.

At the International Criminal Court, also located in The Hague, Tomoko Akane, 68, serves as the president. Commenting on the fact that the two international courts both have Japanese people in roles of major responsibility, Iwasawa pointed out, “We carry out our duties as individuals and are not representing Japan.”

Noting people's growing awareness of international justice, however, he expressed his hope that more Japanese will play active roles internationally, and not just in the field of justice.

Iwasawa said, “Most Japanese students have the capacity to take an active part in the world. I would like them to be strongly motivated and sharpen their English language skills, no matter what field they want to be in.”

Former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence has spoken out against the White House's stance on the war in Ukraine, saying its actions have ""only emboldened Russia"" despite efforts to bring about a ceasefire.

""If the last three years teaches us anything, it's that (Russian President) Vladimir Putin doesn't want peace; he wants Ukraine,"" Pence said in an interview with CNN published on May 5.

""And the fact that we are now nearly two months following a ceasefire agreement that Ukraine has agreed to and Russia continues to delay and give excuses confirms that point,"" he added.

Ukraine has already agreed to a U.S.-proposed full 30-day ceasefire, saying on March 11 that Kyiv is ready if Russia also agrees to the terms. So far, Moscow has refused.

Trump has reportedly grown frustrated with the slow progression of peace negotiations, claiming on April 26 that Putin may be ""tapping me along,"" and that he may not be interested in ending the war.

While Trump has so far resisted applying any real pressure on the Kremlin, has has been willing to temporarily turn off military aid and stop intelligence sharing with Ukraine.

Criticizing the approach, Pence said Putin ""only understands power.""

""It's the reason why, in this moment, we need to make it clear that the United States is going to continue to lead the free world, to provide Ukraine with the military support they need to repel the Russian invasion and achieve a just and lasting peace,"" he said.

""The wavering support the administration has shown over the last few months, I believe, has only emboldened Russia.""

Instead of agreeing to the U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire in March, the Kremlin has instead unilaterally declared its own partial truces.

Putin on April 28 announced a so-called ""humanitarian truce"" from May 7-9, during Moscow's Victory Day celebrations.

Despite being from what the White House had originally called for, Trump on May 5 hailed it as a significant step towards a peace settlement.

""As you know, President Putin just announced a three-day ceasefire, which doesn't sound like much, but it's a lot, if you know where we started from,"" Trump told reporters in an Oval Office briefing.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed Putin's announcement as a ""theatrical performance"" rather than a serious move towards peace.

In his interview with CNN, Pence also warned of the long-term consequences of not achieving a just peace in Ukraine.

""This is not just about Ukraine for me. I really do believe that if Vladimir Putin overruns Ukraine, it's just a matter of time before he crosses a border where our men and women in uniform are going to have to go fight him,"" he said.

""I hold to that old Reagan doctrine that if you're willing to fight our enemies on your soil, we'll give you the means to fight them there so we don't have to fight them.""","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

A Russian drone attack on Odesa Oblast on May 5 killed one and caused damage to local infrastructure, regional Governor Oleh Kiper reported.

Russia regularly strikes civilian infrastructure with missile and drone attacks as it wages its war against Ukraine. Russia attacked border villages in Sumy Oblast on May 5, killing three residents and injuring seven others.

Several houses were damaged in Odesa Oblast as a result of the attack, Kiper said in a post to Telegram.

""The body of a deceased person was found in one of the houses. Additional information about the victims is being verified,"" Kiper said.

Several fires broke out in the aftermath of Russia's drone attack, and emergency services worked to extinguish the fires, Kiper reported.

On April 28, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a so-called ""humanitarian"" truce to take place beginning on May 8 in Russia's war against Ukraine to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe.

President Volodymyr Zelensky slammed Putin's proposal for a short-lived truce and pointed to Russia's strikes on civilian targets as proof that Russia does not want to end its war against Ukraine.

""We value human lives, not parades. That's why we believe — and the world believes — that there is no reason to wait until May 8,"" Zelensky said.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth looks on as President Donald Trump delivers remarks in the Oval Office at the White House, in Washington, on March 21.Carlos Barria/Reuters

Roughly a week after Donald Trump started his second term as president, the U.S. military issued an order to three freight airlines operating out of Dover Air Force Base in Delaware and a U.S. base in Qatar: Stop 11 flights loaded with artillery shells and other weaponry and bound for Ukraine.

In a matter of hours, frantic questions reached Washington from Ukrainians in Kyiv and from officials in Poland, where the shipments were co-ordinated. Who had ordered the U.S. Transportation Command, known as TRANSCOM, to halt the flights? Was it a permanent pause on all aid? Or just some?

Top national security officials – in the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department – couldn't provide answers. Within one week, flights were back in the air.

The verbal order originated from the office of Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defence, according to TRANSCOM records reviewed by Reuters. A TRANSCOM spokesperson said the command received the order via the Pentagon's Joint Staff.

The cancellations came after Trump wrapped up a January 30 Oval Office meeting about Ukraine that included Hegseth and other top national security officials, according to three sources familiar with the situation. During the meeting, the idea of stopping Ukraine aid came up, said two people with knowledge of the meeting, but the president issued no instruction to stop aid to Ukraine.

The president was unaware of Hegseth's order, as were other top national security officials in the meeting, according to two sources briefed on the private White House discussions and another with direct knowledge of the matter.

Asked to comment on this report, the White House told Reuters that Hegseth had followed a directive from Trump to pause aid to Ukraine, which it said was the administration's position at the time. It did not explain why, according to those who spoke to Reuters, top national security officials in the normal decision making process didn't know about the order or why it was so swiftly reversed.

“Negotiating an end to the Russia-Ukraine War has been a complex and fluid situation. We are not going to detail every conversation among top administration officials throughout the process,” said Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokeswoman. “The bottom line is the war is much closer to an end today than it was when President Trump took office.”

The cancellations cost TRANSCOM $2.2 million, according to the records reviewed by Reuters. In response to a request for comment, TRANSCOM said that the total cost was $1.6 million – 11 flights were cancelled but one incurred no charge.

An order halting military aid authorized under the Biden administration went into effect officially a month later, on March 4, with a White House announcement.

The story of how flights were cancelled, detailed by Reuters for the first time, points to an at-times haphazard policy-making process within the Trump administration and a command structure that is unclear even to its own ranking members. The multiday pause of the flights, confirmed by five people with knowledge of it, also shows confusion in how the administration has created and implemented national security policy. At the Pentagon, the disarray is an open secret, with many current and former officials saying the department is plagued by internal disagreements on foreign policy, deep-seated grudges, and inexperienced staff.

Reuters couldn't establish exactly when Hegseth's office ordered the freight flights cancelled. Two sources said Ukrainian and European officials began asking about the pause on February 2. The TRANSCOM records indicate that there was a verbal order from “SECDEF” – the secretary of defence – that stopped the flights and that they had resumed by February 5.

“This is consistent with the administration's policy to move fast, break things and sort it out later. That is their managing philosophy,” said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine officer and defence expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. “That is great for Silicon Valley. But when you're talking about institutions that have been around for hundreds of years, you are going to run into problems.”

The stop in shipments caused consternation in Kyiv.

The Ukrainians quickly asked the administration through multiple channels but had difficulty obtaining any useful information, according to a Ukrainian official with direct knowledge of the situation. In later conversations with the Ukrainians, the administration wrote off the pause as “internal politics,” said the source. Ukrainian officials did not respond to requests for comment.

The shipping of American weapons to Ukraine requires sign-off from multiple agencies and can take weeks or even months to complete, depending on the size of the cargo. The majority of US military assistance goes through a logistics hub in Poland before being picked up by Ukrainian representatives and transported into the country.

That hub can hold shipments for extended periods of time. It's not clear if the 11 cancelled flights were the only ones scheduled that week in February, how much aid was already stockpiled in Poland and if it continued to flow into Ukraine despite the U.S. military's orders. The revelations come at a time of upheaval in the department. Several of Hegseth's top advisers were escorted from the building April 15 after being accused of unauthorized disclosure of classified information. The secretary continues to face scrutiny, including from Congress, about his own communications. Previously he's attributed allegations of upheaval to disgruntled employees. The cancelled flights contained weapons that had long been approved by the Biden administration, authorized by lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Reuters couldn't determine if Hegseth or his team knew how the order to TRANSCOM would play out or that the order would be a substantial change in U.S. policy on Ukraine. Three sources familiar with the situation said Hegseth misinterpreted discussions with the president about Ukraine policy and aid shipments without elaborating further.

Four other people briefed on the situation said a small cadre of staffers inside the Pentagon, many of whom have never held a government job and who have for years spoken out against U.S. aid to Ukraine, advised Hegseth to consider pausing aid to the country.

Two people familiar with the matter denied there was a true cutoff in aid. One of them described it as a logistical pause.

“(They) just wanted to get a handle on what was going on and people, as a result, misinterpreted that as: ‘You need to stop everything,'” said one.

According to two sources with knowledge of the meeting, Hegseth arrived at the January 30 Oval Office meeting with Trump with a memo drafted by some of his top policy advisers, advocating that their boss push the White House to consider pausing weapons deliveries to Ukraine to gain leverage in peace negotiations with Russia. The sources said the secretary attended the meeting with other top officials involved in Ukraine policy, including National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg. The group broadly discussed U.S. policy on Ukraine and Russia, including potentially tightening sanctions on Moscow.

It's not clear the extent to which Hegseth proposed stopping aid during the meeting, but the idea came up in discussions, said one of the sources and another person familiar with the meeting.

Since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, the U.S. had approved billions of dollars worth of military aid to Ukraine. Most was delivered under the Biden administration. But a few shipments remained in the pipeline, scheduled into this summer.

Trump had threatened to freeze aid repeatedly on the campaign trail, but had yet to do so. And during the meeting, he again declined to stop aid to Ukraine or order Hegseth to implement any policy changes when it came to sending equipment to Kyiv, the sources said.

An order effectively freezing any military support for an ally would normally be discussed intensively among top national security officials and approved by the president. It requires the co-ordination of multiple agencies and often multiple freight companies.

None of that discussion or co-ordination happened when Hegseth's office cancelled the scheduled flights carrying American artillery shells and ammunition to Poland from Al Udeid military base in the United Arab Emirates and the Dover U.S. military base in Delaware, three of the sources said.

The pause came as Ukraine's military was struggling to fend off Russian forces in eastern Ukraine and in the consequential battle for the Kursk region of Russia, where Ukrainian forces were losing ground and have since all but been expelled.

Close Trump advisers got tipped off to the pause by Pentagon staffers and discussed with the president whether to restore the aid shipments, according to two sources. By then, TRANSCOM had cancelled 11 flights, according to the records reviewed by Reuters. Some media outlets, including Reuters, wrote about the pause but Hegseth's role was previously unknown.

It's unclear if Trump subsequently questioned or reprimanded Hegseth. One source with direct knowledge of the matter said National Security Adviser Waltz ultimately intervened to reverse the cancellations. Waltz was forced out on Thursday and is expected to be nominated as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

When Trump entered office, aid to Ukraine continued flowing and he pledged to work with Ukraine and Russia to end the war – or at the very least broker a ceasefire.

Two of his most prominent envoys, Kellogg, a supporter of Kyiv who worked with Trump in his first administration, and Steve Witkoff, a real-estate magnate and close friend of the president, set out to negotiate with both parties.

Separately, at the Pentagon, some of Hegseth's policy advisers privately started drafting proposals to pull back American support for Ukraine, according to two sources briefed on the matter.

That group of staffers align themselves closely with the anti-interventionist philosophy.

Some have previously advised Republican lawmakers advocating for an America-first approach to foreign policy and have called publicly, in writings and talks, for the U.S. to pull back from military commitments in the Mideast and Europe – a view similarly held by Vice President JD Vance. Several have advocated that the U.S. instead focus on China.

Supporters of the staffers have slammed those pushing back on the anti-interventionist movement in the administration, claiming Vance and others are merely trying to save the lives of people living in warzones like Ukraine and prevent future American military deaths.

The infighting has complicated the policy-making process, according to a person familiar with the matter and four other sources. At a time when Kellogg and Witkoff are trying to broker a peace deal with Russia and Ukraine, the staffers have advocated behind the scenes for the U.S. to draw back its support for Kyiv – a policy that has angered Ukrainian officials and pressured European allies to fill the gap, five people with knowledge of the situation said. Washington has signed a deal with Kyiv for rights to its rare earth minerals – an agreement U.S. officials say is an attempt to recoup money America has spent to prop up Ukraine's war effort.

At least one of the staffers who had previously pushed for the administration to pull back its support for Kyiv, Dan Caldwell, was escorted out of the Pentagon for a leak he claims never happened. Caldwell, a veteran, served as one of Hegseth's chief advisers, including on Ukraine.

Despite the brief pause in February and the longer one that began in early March, the Trump administration has resumed sending the last of the aid approved under U.S. President Joe Biden. No new policy has been announced.

Editor's note: (May 6, 2025): This story has been updated to show one of the U.S. bases mentioned in the first paragraph is in Qatar, not the UAE.

Honda CR-V and Civics on a trailer leave the Honda of Canada Manufacturing, Plant 1, in Alliston, Ont., on April 15.Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail

Baris Akyurek is the vice-president of insights and intelligence at AutoTrader.

We were so close to getting back to ‘normal.' The automotive industry has been through a lot since early 2020: declining inventory, surging demand, the continuing EV transition and fluctuations in pricing and interest rates. 

By 2024, the good news was that things were finally normalizing. Used car prices decreased by 12.1 per cent last year, new car inventory returned to 2019 levels and demand remained strong for both new and used vehicles. However, now there's a new roadblock in 2025: tariffs. This article follows up on a previous pretariff analysis to provide a real-time temperature check on where things stand – so far.

Spurred by the threat of looming tariffs, we observed an active automotive market in March. AutoTrader.ca saw an uptick in user activity: visits and engagement with listings both for new and used vehicles were up substantially and car shoppers – compared with the pretariff period and same time last year – have been sending more sales inquiries to dealers and private sellers across all our platforms. 

Canada's tariff war journal

Canadian car shoppers rushed into the new car market while inventory was available and before prices could rise. And, as our research showed in early February, many used car buyers accelerated their purchases, while some new car shoppers switched to used vehicles in anticipation of price increases.

Typically, what we see during ‘normal' times, is used vehicles start with an established base price and decline throughout the year. March marks the start of the spring buying season and usually brings more buyers into the market with increased price competition. For example, in 2019 (the last ‘normal' year), used car prices dropped 0.7 per cent in March month over month; in 2024, they were down 2.1 per cent.

This year, however, the market saw a slight uptick – a 0.3 per cent increase to $36,823 – driven by tariff-related demand and expectations of pandemic-like price surges. 

More buyers entered the market and some shifted from new to used vehicles. AutoTrader has a feature that monitors price drops for vehicle listings over time and our analysis of it shows 23-per-cent fewer listings with price reductions in March alone. This trend has already continued well into April. 

AutoTrader estimates 1.5 million fewer new cars were sold between 2020 and 2023, which is now affecting the used market, as those vehicles simply never entered the buy/sell pool. 

The weak Canadian dollar has also led to more used vehicles being exported to the United States. An AutoTrader analysis shows a negative correlation between used car exports and the strength of the Canadian dollar: when the dollar is weak, more cars head south of the border. Now, with tariffs in place on both new and used vehicles, there's a potential silver lining: fewer cars will be exported, allowing for more used vehicle inventory to stay in Canada. This could help ease supply constraints and relieve some pricing pressure for Canadian buyers.

New car supply is relatively healthy, with 67 days' worth of inventory (60 days is considered ‘healthy' by industry standard). This buffer likely contributes to why new car prices have remained flat so far in 2025, though it's not by a significant margin. 

It's also important to note that the 67-day figure is an average: some brands have more than 100 days of supply, while others have less than 30 days, so we may see more fluctuation in months to come.

With so much uncertainty around tariffs, it's difficult to predict exactly what will happen next. For now, the industry outlook remains similar to what it was before tariffs. If this is a short-term disruption, the market – especially for new cars – has enough supply to absorb some volatility. However, used car supply is more challenged and demand is on the rise, which is why we've already seen some price movement. 

Sales forecasts vary widely, so rather than wait to speculate, we suggest that if Canadian car shoppers are active in the market and have found the right vehicle, that they act promptly to secure it.

As we face these recent tariffs, it's worth remembering that the Canadian automotive market has weathered storms before. We endured the 2008 global financial crisis and navigated through the pandemic disruption earlier this decade, and adapted each time. While today's volatility is challenging, it's also an opportunity to learn and respond. We remain confident in our industry's strength and resilience – and in Canadians' determination to move forward together, no matter what the road ahead brings.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Ukraine: Moscow drone attacks force airport closures","https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-moscow-drone-attacks-force-airport-closures/live-72443587","Tue, 06 May 2025 06:25:06 GMT","

Russia closed a dozen airports due to Ukrainian drone attacks in several cities, including the capital. The attacks come just days ahead of a major military parade to celebrate the end of World War II. DW has the latest.

Ukrainian drone attacks forced the closure of numerous airports across Russia overnight.

Moscow is expecting allies to attend a major military parade in the capital on Friday.

Elsewhere, the EU will outline its plan to end all remaining Russian gas deliveries and stop future contracts from being signed.

Here are the latest developments in Russia's war on Ukraine on May 6:

The European Commission unveiled a long-promised plan to phase out all remaining gas imports from Russia to the EU by the end of 2027.

""Today the European Union sends a very clear message to Russia: no more, no more, will we permit Russia to weaponise energy against us,"" EU energy chief Dan Jorgensen said as he set out the measures.

According to the plan, a ban on new contracts and short-term deliveries, so-called spot contracts, is to take effect by the end of this year. Existing long-term contracts are to be phased out by the end of 2027.

Two-thirds of Russia's imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and pipeline gas are based on long-term contracts.That prompted the European Commission, which wants to end the bloc's energy dependence on Moscow, to propose a two-stage ban.

""A phased approach to eliminating Russian gas imports would allow markets to better adjust and minimize market impact and potential implications for security of supply,"" a plan read.

The EU's executive branch said it would follow up with a legal proposal on the gas import ban in June.

Russian gas deliveries to Europe via the transit pipeline through Ukraine stopped completely on January 1 as contracts for 2019 expired.

However, around 19% of Europe's gas still comes from Russia via the TurkStream pipeline and LNG deliveries, compared to around 45% before 2022.

Ukraine and Russia exchanged hundreds of prisoners of war on the Belarusian-Ukrainian border.

According to the Russian Defense Ministry, each side released 205 people. ""As a result of negotiations, 205 Russian servicemen were returned,"" the ministry said in a statement.

""In exchange, 205 prisoners of war of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were handed over,"" it added.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed the news, writing: ""Young and older men from almost all types and branches of the Armed Forces. Defenders of Mariupol and the entire front line.""

""I thank our partners — first and foremost the United Arab Emirates — for their mediation and support,"" he added.

The two sides last exchanged prisoners in April.

North Korea's KCNA state media on Tuesday reported the arrival of a government delegation from Belarus. KCNA reported that the delegation is being led by Belarus Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Shuleiko. 

The talks in Pyongyang are said to be focused on increased trade and economic cooperation. The visit is scheduled to last until Friday.   

Both Belarus and North Korea are Russian allies and are generally regarded as international pariahs in their own right. Both have aided Russia in its illegal war of aggression in Ukraine.

Like Russia, each is also ruled by strongman dictators with an iron grip on power and entrenched, repressive regimes that oversee exceedingly impoverished societies.

Officials in Russia say President Vladimir Putin will deliver a speech Friday at what is being billed as the ""grandest"" Victory Day parade ever to mark 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.

Putin has elevated the May 9 celebration throughout the course of his 25-year reign, framing it as a massive celebration of Russian patriotism. He has also sought to justify his own war of aggression in neighboring Ukraine as a mission to ""de-Nazify"" the country — echoing the ""Great Patriotic War"" against Nazi Germany.

World War II was devastating for Russia, costing more than 20 million civilian and military lives after Adolf Hitler broke his non-aggression pact with the Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union in 1941. Russian complicity in the early phase of the war is not spoken of in today's Russian Federation.

Ukraine has labeled the event a sham, saying it has, ""nothing to do with the victory over Nazism,"" while adding that among those soldiers marching in Red Square are ""quite likely"" many who have engaged in war crimes against Ukrainians.  

Kyiv has also denounced a Russian three-day ceasefire coinciding with the event as a gimmick ""for the parade,"" noting that Moscow has ignored US calls for a 30-day pause to facilitate peace talks, continuing instead to shell Ukraine daily despite international outcry over the three-year invasion.

Russia continued its drone strikes on the Ukrainian port city of Odesa on Monday, said Governor Oleh Kiper.

Kiper took to the social media channel Telegram to announce that one person had been killed in an overnight assault.

Russia has increased attacks on the city as US President Donald Trump pushes for a ceasefire. 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently called for more pressure to be exerted on Russian President Vladimir Putin — whom Trump has so far been soft on — to end his war of aggression after two people were killed in Russian attacks on the Black Sea port city last week.

Germany is expected to shift its policy toward Russia when Friedrich Merz is formally elected chancellor . Merz, from the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), was expected to be elected chancellor Tuesday but surprisingly lost the first round of voting. He is considerably more hawkish on Russia than his predecessor, Social Democrat (SPD) Olaf Scholz. 

Unlike Scholz, Merz has voiced support for sending German-made Taurus lang-range missiles to Kyiv as it defends itself against an ongoing Russian war of aggression that is now in its third year. Scholz had been loathe to supply the weapons for fear of Russian retribution over what Moscow has framed as a potential escalation.

Merz will also have a foreign minister at his side that shares his hawkish views. Johann Wadephul, a former soldier, has described Russia as Europe's ""most acute"" threat and has been a strong advocate for supplying Kyiv with Taurus missiles.

Germany is also set to greatly increase military spending under Merz as it attempts to make up for lost time with a depleted military and the looming threat of the US pulling back its own security commitments to Europe under President Donald Trump. 

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, a holdover from the outgoing Scholz government, has backed the shift toward a more robust military, saying, ""we must establish deterrence to make sure that it does not come to a worst-case scenario."" 

Pistorius has called for the country to become ""war ready"" by 2029 amid fears that Russian President Vladimir Putin's expansionist appetite may not be sated by swallowing parts of Ukraine but that he desires to push on further into Europe, directly threatening the Baltic states and Germany's neighbor Poland.

The European Union (EU) will present a ""roadmap"" for terminating all current and future Russian gas deliveries to the block on Tuesday.

Once the EU's top gas supplier, Russia fell out of favor with the 27-member bloc over its war of aggression with EU aspirant Ukraine. 

Though there was relatively broad consensus that deliveries should end, the bloc has continued to feed Russian coffers as the result of the complicated unwinding of dozens of years of cooperation.

The EU now aims to end its reliance on Russian gas by 2027. 

The European Commission is seeking ways to allow companies to withdraw from existing contracts, for instance, but legal experts say these could potentially face penalties or arbitration should they do so. Many European companies have so-called ""take or pay"" contracts that require them to pay for contracted gas whether they accept delivery or not.

Any changes now would depend on approval by the EU parliament and potentially a majority of member states depending on EU's legal approach.

The EU currently imports roughly 19% of its gas from Russia — in 2022, that number was 40%. Though sanctioning imports would quickly curtail deliveries, this would require unanimous EU support — Hungary and Slovakia, however, have refused to go along with the plan.

Russian authorities were forced to close a dozen airports for several hours Tuesday following a second night of Ukrainian drone attacks. Russian news agencies cited the Federal Air Transport Agency as having restricted flights at four Moscow airports, as well as in Nizhny Novgorod, Volgograd and elsewhere. 

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that a total of 19 drones had been downed in the city overnight but that ""no damage or casualties"" had resulted from the assault. Dozens more drones were reported to have been shot down in other regions across the country including Kursk, Voronezh, Pena and others. 

The scale of the attacks is unclear at the moment and Kyiv has yet to comment. Ukraine has increased strikes on infrastructure it says is key to Moscow's ongoing war of aggression — launched on February 24, 2022 — with Tuesday's assault being a reminder to citizens in the capital that the Kremlin's ongoing war is not be as distant as it appears. 

The attacks come just days before a major military parade in the capital that is set to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, which Russia celebrates on May 9. The parade will see several Russian allies in attendance and feature a speech by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who last week declared a three-day ceasefire between May 8 and 10 in line with the celebration. 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has scoffed at Putin's proposal, calling instead for the implementation of a US-proposed 30-day unconditional ceasefire. ""The Russians are asking for a ceasefire on May 9 and are themselves firing at Ukraine every day,"" wrote Zelenskyy on Sunday in a social media post. ""This is cynicism of the highest order."" Putin has rejected the US plan.

For more than three years, Western observers have puzzled over the true state of Russia's economy. At times, it has appeared to buckle under the strain of sanctions — at others, it has shown unexpected strength.

In 2023, Russia's gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 4.1%, and in 2024, by 4.3%.

However, the momentum, largely fueled by the shift to a wartime economy, now appears to be fading. Many economists expect Russia's growth to be cut in half, dropping to just 2%. For instance, Germany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy projects GDP growth of only 1.5% for 2025 and just 0.8% for 2026.

Even the Russian central bank is expecting a slowdown, Russian state news agency Interfax reported recently, sticking to its lower forecast of between 1% and 2% growth for 2025, and 0.5% to 1.5% next year.

The Munich, Germany-based ifo Institute is even more pessimistic, predicting that after a modest uptick in 2025, Russia's economy will contract by 0.8% in 2026.

One major drag is Russia's exorbitantly high interest rate, currently 21%, which is choking off private investment. The auto industry and mechanical engineering sectors are particularly hard hit, followed by construction and steel.

At the same time, the roughly 40% gain of the Russian currency ruble against the US dollar since the start of the year has surprised many analysts.

According to Vasily Astrov, a Russia expert at the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (WIIW), the ruble appreciation was largely a response to US President Donald Trump's conciliatory stance toward Russia.

""When President Trump took office, he said he would take a radically different approach to Russia than his predecessor, Joe Biden,"" Astrov told DW. Trump had hinted at closer cooperation and even a loosening or repeal of US sanctions, which triggered ""euphoria"" on Russian financial markets, with stocks and the ruble both ""appreciating significantly,"" Astrov said.

In November 2024, the US toughened sanctions on Gazprombank, a major Russian  belonging to the state-owned energy giant, excluding it from the US financial system. The move froze its US assets and cut off business with American firms. Gazprombank is central to processing gas payments and financing military-related projects.

While the European Union had exempted Gazprombank from sanctions until the end of 2024 to allow continued payments for Russian gas, the US move had an immediate impact. The ruble lost a quarter of its value against the dollar, and the stock market plunged, especially in the financial and energy sectors.

It was no surprise, then, that Russian policymakers paid close attention when Donald Trump, after a late-April meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Rome, hinted it might be time to ""deal with [Putin] differently."" Trump's likely Russia policy U-turn reportedly includes new measures targeting the banking sector as well as so-called secondary sanctions.

Trump's threat of ""secondary sanctions"" refers to penalties imposed on third countries, companies, or individuals who continue doing business with Russia.

Trump ally Senator Lindsey Graham responded to Trump's remarks with a post on X, writing that he and a bipartisan group of nearly 60 senators were preparing legislation to expand sanctions to any country importing Russian energy products.

The bill, Graham noted, would impose secondary tariffs on countries buying Russian oil, gas, uranium, or other products.

Astrov says Graham's new Russia sanctions bill could be targeting China and India primarily.

""China is now Russia's most important trading partner, accounting for around 40% of its imports and 30% of its exports in 2024. Crucial imports for the military industry are routed through China and Hong Kong,"" said Astrov.

India also played a key role in propping up the Russian economy, he added, as China and India together ""absorb more than half of Russia's total oil exports.""

While China's refusal to join Western sanctions was expected and India's neutrality also came as no major surprise, the unexpected player in the sanctions game was Turkey, he said, because the country also declined sanctions despite being a ""NATO member and part of a customs union with the European Union.""

Under President Biden, secondary sanctions were strictly enforced, and violations were punished. Astrov notes that especially Chinese and Turkish banks that accepted payments from Russia came under heavy pressure from the Biden administration.

The Trump administration, however, changed the policy, for example, by disbanding the department within the finance ministry that is responsible for targeting Russian oligarch assets and by ""massively easing"" the enforcement of secondary sanctions.

Astrov thinks it's currently ""difficult to predict"" how deeply new secondary sanctions under a second Trump administration would affect Russia's economic partners.

One reason for this was recently reported by the Reuters news agency. Reuters said that major Russian banks have set up a netting payments system dubbed ""The China Track"" for transactions with China, aiming to ""reduce their visibility to Western regulators and mitigate the risk of secondary sanctions.""

Banking sources told Reuters the system has been operational for some time and is used by several sanctioned Russian banks. It relied on intermediaries in countries still willing to trade with Russia and had ""not yet suffered any major setbacks,"" according to Reuters.

""I do not rule out that the Chinese partners will no longer be afraid of secondary sanctions,"" Reuters quoted Alexander Shokhin as saying — the head of the powerful RSPP business lobby group, who takes part in trade negotiations with China.

Demanding to know what happened to missing cats like Linky, a 12-year-old tabby, Julie, a calico, Tarzan a black-and-white moggy and Charlie, another tabby, a baying mob descended on a house in a quiet street in Santa Ana.

The residents of the California town, rocked by allegations of a serial cat killer in their midst, feel they have been provoked into taking matters into their own hands.

The only problem is the man they were seeking to confront did not live in the home.

Alejandro Acosta Oliveros, whom locals suspect is behind the spate of disappearances, was arrested on April 23.

Police said he was detained after being “positively identified by witnesses”.

Upon searching his home, officers found the bodies of “dozens” of cats, according to Natalie Garcia, the Public Information Officer (PIO).

Mr Oliveros was charged with animal cruelty offences, carrying a potential three-year jail term.

But to the fury of the local community fearing for the safety of their few remaining pets, he was last month released on a $20,000 bail.

In southern California the main threat to wandering cats is traffic and predatory beasts such as coyotes.

But in the town of Santa Ana, around 30 miles south of Los Angeles, as many as 30 beloved pets are missing, feared dead.

Sarai Gold, who is heading the campaign to put Mr Acosta Oliveros behind bars, told The Telegraph that locals think the number of victims could be more than 75.

They are terrified that number will rise after the man they claim is behind the killings was released on bail, she said.

At a vigil for the pets on April 26 candles were lit to mark each of the victims, but things soon turned violent.

Surrounding a house, protesters carried signs accusing the suspect of having blood on his hands.

One sign read: “Hoy gatos, manana humanos (today cats, tomorrow humans).”

Dramatic footage captured by a local news channel shows one man clad in black hurling a rock at the home, meanwhile someone with a megaphone shouts: “Your community is watching your every move”, as blue police lights illuminate the scene.

Other neighbours can be seen appearing to try to pull down a fence, while a separate clip, posted online, shows a woman wearing white cat ears wailing in the street over the loss of her beloved pet.

“I miss my cat, I love my cat,” she sobs.

Things came to a head when the homeowner was allegedly pepper sprayed by one of the angry mob.

“He was arrested and then they let him go. People are out for blood and I could not agree more,” a witness posted on Nextdoor after the night of violence.

Another told Fox11: “The peaceful protesting wasn't so peaceful. They're scaring kids here. It's scaring the whole family.”

“I don't think it needs to be like this. I think it should have remained a vigil… I knew it'd be a protest, but I didn't think I'd get violent,” a third local told the network.

However, the property targeted by the angry mob was not, as it had been rumoured, the home of Mr Acosta Oliveros's brother, where he had been staying, but of someone related to the suspect's brother-in-law.

The incident prompted local police to issue a stark warning. “While we support the community's right to peacefully assemble, the Santa Ana Police Department will not tolerate acts of violence, vandalism, or any threats to public safety,” a spokesman said in a statement.

“Any damage to life or property will have consequences, and those engaging in criminal behaviour will be held accountable.”

Tensions continue to run high within the community as rumours abound of the creature's gruesome deaths.

According to Ms Gold, the cat killer lured some of his victims with catnip-laced food.

She claims the creatures' bodies were found by investigators in a fire pit and there was “such a stench”.

Other reports paint an increasingly horrific picture. Local news reported one cat was allegedly found hanging from a tree. Another, whose jaw was broken, was dumped in a skip, it was claimed.

There are unconfirmed rumours that some of the cats were skinned.

Some locals believe cats were killed with a stamp to the head, others say they were injected with an unknown substance, according to KTLA Five.

There are claims people saw cats snatched from their neighbour's driveways, meanwhile grainy CCTV footage, obtained by NBC News, appears to show a man reaching down to coax a creature from beneath a car into his arms.

“I saw this same man grab [my] neighbour's cat, inject it with a needle and some sort of substance. I saw him and yelled, hey...to get his attention,” one person wrote on the platform Nextdoor.

“He got up and ran, jumped in his truck and left. And from what we know that cat died, and the owner went and put in a police report.”

Jennifer Corales wrote on the site she had seen the man picking up a cat and driving away with it, following the man in the car.

“We followed him at a distance and called the police. The police just told us to stay where we were until they arrived and not to follow him because we did not know how dangerous this person could be,” she said.

Police have not commented on the state any of the cats were found in.

Amid the horror is a heartbroken community, with owners bereft at the loss of their pets.

Edith Fuentes, who lost her cat, told Fox 11: “We are devastated, just to think about what this man did to her.

“Every time we think about it, we sit down and we cry, because your pets become like a part of your family.”

Jennifer Corrales added: “I've had [my cat] since he was a baby. I bottle-fed him...He's been with me since a few weeks old. I don't know what he might have done to my cat.”

Anger has been directed at Todd Spitzer, the Republican District Attorney, following Mr Acosta Oliveros's release.

“That he was released so quickly is a travesty,” said Meredith Kirby, an organiser with OC Community Cats, a local animal welfare group.

“This man has a terrifying history of harming and even killing innocent cats, posing a very personal and real threat to my own feline friends,” Vanessa Rodriguez wrote online.

“Our quiet community has been shattered by the horrifying actions of Mr Oliveros… shocking as it may be, he's out on the streets while our pets live in fear,” she added.

The Santa Ana police department was contacted for comment.

Mr Oliveros is set to attend court on May 22.

A chilling report on the spike in violence against abortion providers should concern us all.

A chilling report on the spike in violence against abortion providers should concern us all.

Since Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022, abortion bans have spread widely across the South and Midwest. Abortion is totally or near-totally banned in 16 states, and these bans have forced the closure of 42 clinics in the U.S., according to The Guttmacher Institute.

For the clinics that have remained open, it hasn't been a smooth ride, either. In 2023 alone, more than 170,000 abortion seekers were forced to travel out of state to access care. That is a dramatic influx in patients for abortion clinics in states where abortion remains legal. But it's not just an increase in patients that clinics are forced to deal with in post-Roe America — they must also contend with the ongoing, and in some places, increasing acts of anti-abortion violence.

The National Abortion Federation (NAF) recently released statistics on abortion clinic disruption and violence for 2023 and 2024, and their findings are harrowing. In the two years since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization Supreme Court ruling, there were more than 750 cases of obstruction of a clinic, nearly 300 death threats or threats of harm, and more than 600 cases of trespassing. That's a case of obstruction for most days since Roe was overturned. And that's just the incidents accounted for in NAF's report — the number of incidents of harassment and violence targeting abortion providers is likely higher due to unreported incidents.

The findings on violence against abortion clinics reveals a steady increase that should alarm anyone who supports abortion access. The number of incidents of assault and battery increased by 137 percent from 2021-2022, obstructions increased by 134 percent, and picketing increased by nearly 72 percent. From 2010 to 2019, NAF documented 15 cases of arson against abortion clinics. From 2020 to 2024, there have been 14 arson attacks — nearly the same number in less than half the time.

Now, with the same president back in office who appointed the three Supreme Court justices who promptly voted to overturn Roe v. Wade and an administration decidedly acrimonious to abortion rights, that level of protection — even if mostly superficial — is now gone.

But violence against abortion providers is sadly nothing new. It has remained consistent since Roe v. Wade was initially decided, and the end of Roe has only exacerbated it. Since Roe was decided in 1973, disruption and violence against abortion clinics has been a constant tool of abortion opponents to disrupt access to abortion care and terrorize both providers and patients.

Since 1973, 11 abortion providers and clinic staff have been murdered, and 26 others have survived attempted murder. There have been 42 bombings, 206 arson attacks, more than 600 cases of assault and battery against abortion clinic staff, and four kidnappings. Abortion providers routinely fear violence because of this very long-standing track record.

But it's not just acts of violence that make abortion providers uneasy. Picketing, obstruction and even trespassing have been used by abortion opponents to make accessing an abortion as difficult as possible. The anti-abortion group Operation Rescue brought thousands of aggressive protesters to the front door of clinics to wreak havoc — they would chain themselves to clinic doors, lay down in traffic, and go to other elaborate lengths to keep abortion clinics from opening their doors. Once anti-abortion activists started murdering abortion providers in 1993, the federal government was finally forced to intervene.

The result was the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act. Signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1994, the FACE Act made it a felony to obstruct the entrance of a reproductive health facility, and violators face up to 10 years in prison. (However, this did not halt attacks on abortion providers: In 2009, Kansas-based abortion provider George Tiller was murdered while attending church, and in 2015, an anti-abortion extremist opened fire at a Planned Parenthood in Colorado, killing three people.) The FACE Act is still law, but it also requires a sympathetic Justice Department to enforce it, and that is unlikely now. In his first week in office this term, Donald Trump pardoned and released anti-abortion activists who blockaded a Washington, D.C. clinic, including Lauren Handy, who were convicted under the FACE Act during the Biden administration. Calling it “a great honor” to free them, Trump and his administration have made clear that, even if the FACE Act still technically exists, his administration has absolutely no intention of using it to protect clinics.

That's what makes NAF's report even more daunting — aggression and violence against abortion clinics haven't stopped, and now, they're likely to be given even greater leeway by a hostile administration. “The FACE Act is there to act as protection for clinics and for folks who access abortion care, to protect their safety and ability to access those clinics freely,” Amy Friedrich-Karnik, federal policy director at the Guttmacher Institute, recently told Truthout. “I think it's a signal to the anti-abortion movement that they are allowed to harass people outside of clinics as patients try to enter and clinic staff try to go to work. We'll have to see how that plays out, but I think it's a very, very scary message to send and say they aren't going to be enforcing this traditionally bipartisan law.”

Abortion providers are already swamped by an increase in patients from banned states, and the mass closure of clinics across the South and the Midwest makes it easier for anti-abortion protesters to target them.

In my book, Bodies on the Line: At the Front Lines of the Fight to Protect Abortion in America, I detail the costs of persistent anti-abortion protesting at clinics (more than 1 million reported cases since 1973, according to NAF), and the clinic escorts and defenders who volunteered to protect abortion providers and patients when the local, state and federal government wouldn't. Everyday volunteers showed up, creating a safety net that otherwise wouldn't have existed, to help patients enter abortion clinics past the throngs of screaming and aggressive anti-abortion protesters throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

Now, with a Justice Department admittedly hostile to the FACE Act and the same president who appointed the very justices who overturned Roe v. Wade backing impunity for people who have committed violence against abortion providers, abortion providers won't have much in the way of legal support. The makeshift safety net that abortion advocates have created — abortion funds, practical support organizations and clinic escorts — will be forced to try to bridge that growing gap between the law and accessibility, all while putting themselves at risk of aggression and violence. One thing is clear — the safety of abortion providers won't be helped by the federal government. Once again, abortion advocates are going to have to do it for themselves.

NYC Mayor Eric Adams's office threatened to revoke the license of the concert organizers if the event wasn't cancelled.

New York City event organizers have cancelled a Pride month concert by R&B artist Kehlani after pressure from Mayor Eric Adams's office against the outspoken pro-Palestine artist.

The concert, billed as “Pride with Kehlani,” was slated to take place on June 26 in Central Park. It was organized by nonprofit SummerStage, which puts on free concerts across New York. 

The group cited supposed “safety” concerns, which they said were brought to them by the mayor's office, as well as “controversy surrounding Cornell University's” recent cancellation of a performance by the singer over their pro-Palestine views.

The New York performance cancellation has also seemingly come as a direct result of Kehlani's vocal support of Palestinian rights. 

In a letter to SummerStage sent Monday by First Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro, the mayor's office directly cited Cornell's cancellation of the performance — and threatened to revoke SummerStage's license and refer the matter to the police to determine if there was a “risk to public safety” posed by the concert.

“If the foundation does not promptly take steps to ensure public safety, the city reserves all rights and remedies to the foundation's license,” Mastro wrote. 

After the group cancelled the show, the mayor's office seemed to admit that the goal of the letter was to get the concert nixed. 

A spokesperson for Adams's office said in a statement that the administration is “grateful to the City Parks Foundation for responding to our concerns and canceling the Kehlani concert in Central Park,” per The New York Times. Adams, a Democrat, has been a key figure empowering the violent police crackdown on pro-Palestine activists on New York City campuses. 

Late last month, Cornell cancelled a performance by Kehlani, citing their “anti-Israel sentiments” and claiming, without evidence, that they have espoused antisemitic sentiments.

The Grammy-nominated singer has spoken up numerous times against Israel's genocide in Gaza. The artist, for instnace, incorporated pro-Palestinian imagery in a 2024 music video for their song, “Next 2 U.” In the video, the singer and background dancers wore outfits made with keffiyeh material, while they performed in front of a Palestinian flag. The beginning of the video shows a poem by Palestinian American poet Hala Alyan, and the phrase “long live the intifada.”

In response to Cornell's cancellation, Kehlani said in a video posted online, “I'm being asked and called to clarify and make a statement yet again for the millionth time that I am not antisemitic nor anti-Jew.”

“I am anti-genocide, I am anti the actions of the Israeli government,” they said. “I am anti an extermination of an entire people, I am anti the bombing of innocent children, men, women. That's what I'm anti.”

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) New York had previously condemned Cornell's cancellation as suppression of free speech.

“The decision to cancel Kehlani's performance comes after Cornell University has repeatedly suppressed student protests for Palestine and against genocide,” said CAIR-NY Executive Director Afaf Nasher. 

“We strongly condemn Cornell not just for cancelling Kehlani's performance due to her pro-Palestinian stance, but for clearly demonstrating its lack of commitment to free speech and diverse opinion by policing the speech and opinion only of political beliefs in support of Palestine,” Nasher went on.

Kehlani is the latest in a long line of artists, writers and academics who are Palestinian or who have spoken out about Palestinian rights who have faced event cancellations and other retaliation amid the genocide. Recently, Irish band Kneecap faced a deluge of negative press and threats of legal retaliation from U.K. authorities after speaking out for Palestinian rights during a performance at Coachella, in California.

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

The Jalisco New Generation Cartel, a violent drug trafficking group, has been accused by Mexican authorities of operating the Rancho Izaguirre in Jalisco state to train newly recruited gunmen.

He also said that the state Human Rights Commission had formally informed local authorities of the ranch in 2021, but no action was taken.

Following public pressure, the Jalisco state prosecutor's office agreed to publish online photos of the shoes and other clothing items found at the ranch so that families searching for relatives can see them. Manero said that the pieces of evidence will also be made available to relatives.

However, members of the Jalisco Search Warriors have expressed disappointment at Manero's public statements and response, saying they had sufficient evidence that bodies were burned at the site.

A group member, Raúl Servín, also said late April that a compatriot in the group, María del Carmen Morales, had been killed following their discovery in March.

The U.S. government must let some 12,000 refugees into the United States, a federal judge ruled on May 5.

The judge in February blocked government officials from implementing an executive order from the president that suspended the entry of refugees into the country.

The circuit court later clarified that it was not attempting to force the government to grant entry to tens of thousands of refugees and outlined three criteria that conditionally approved individuals must meet.

Lawyers for refugees and the government aligned on the first two points but diverged on the third. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said that arranged and confirmable travel plans meant plans that had been arranged and confirmed, regardless of date, while lawyers for the government said the travel must have been scheduled to take place within two weeks of Trump's inauguration.

Whitehead rejected the latter view, writing that it “requires not just reading between the lines, but hallucinating new text that simply is not there.”

“The Ninth Circuit is capable of imposing temporal limitations when it intends to do so. That it did not do so here must be construed as deliberate,” he said.

If the government's view was correct, according to the judge, it would take the number of refugees the government must admit from roughly 12,000 to 160.

Whitehead said the government must immediately process the approximately 12,000 refugees covered by the narrowed injunction and that the government may face sanctions if it fails to do so.

The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.

A federal judge ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections on May 5 to certify the results of the state's 2024 Supreme Court election and confirm the victory of Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs after the results were challenged by a Republican judge.

Myers wrote that Griffin cannot “change the rules of the game after it had been played.”

“The court cannot countenance that strategy ... which implicates the very integrity of the election and offends 'the law's basic interest in finality,'” the judge wrote.

“Permitting parties to ‘upend the set rules' of an election after the election has taken place can only produce 'confusion and turmoil [which] threatens to undermine public confidence in the federal courts, state agencies, and the elections themselves.'”

Myers's ruling comes after Griffin sought to have more than 60,000 ballots that had been counted in the final tally on Nov. 5 thrown out, with the Republican arguing that voters did not provide their state driver's license numbers or Social Security numbers, as is required when registering under a 2004 state law.

Still, the state's highest court determined that thousands of overseas and military ballots that lacked photo identification as required by state law needed to verify their eligibility within a 30-day period known as a “cure period” or risk having their votes tossed out.

“This case is also about whether a state may redefine its class of eligible voters but offer no process to those who may have been misclassified as ineligible,” he wrote.

The judge concluded that the retroactive invalidation of absentee ballots cast by overseas military and civilian voters violates voters' equal protection and due process rights under the Constitution.

He directed the state's elections board to certify the election results without implementing the “cure period” or removing any ballots from the final count.

Myers stayed his decision for seven days to allow Griffin time to appeal with the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Democrats welcomed the decision.

In December, a consortium of rebel factions led by the group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham unexpectedly toppled the dictator Bashar al-Assad, whose family had ruled Syria for five decades. The new regime in Damascus inherited a country ruined by a 13-year civil war. HTS's leader, Ahmed al-Shara, has taken charge of Syria, and foreign powers are hoping to steer his behavior. Two of the country's neighbors, Israel and Turkey, have taken advantage of the power vacuum by establishing a presence there—and have already begun to butt heads.

Turkey has emerged as the dominant military power in Syria. Since 2019, HTS has held Idlib in Syria's northwest, and for years, Ankara indirectly assisted it by operating a buffer zone in northern Syria that protected the group from Assad's forces. Now Turkey wants even more influence in Syria so it can quash Kurds' hope for autonomy, which flourished in the chaos of the civil war, and engineer the return of the three million Syrian refugees living in Turkey. Yet Israel wants more influence in Syria, too. Although it signed a U.S.-brokered disengagement agreement with Syria in 1974 in the wake of the Yom Kippur War, Assad aligned closely in recent decades with Iran, Israel's chief adversary. Under his rule, Syria served as a critical corridor for the flow of Iranian rockets and other weapons to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, aggravating tensions with Israel.

Given this decades-long enmity, Israeli leaders viewed Assad's ouster as a strategic windfall and are racing to take advantage of his removal by establishing buffer zones and informal spheres of influence in southern Syria. Israel is particularly concerned by Turkey's presence in the country because it fears that Ankara will encourage Syria to harbor anti-Israeli militants. Turkey has tried to spread political Islam and has a history of antagonism toward Israel. In his Eid holiday greeting on March 30, for instance, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, “May Allah destroy Zionist Israel.”

Israeli leaders increasingly worry that Turkey's ambitions in Syria extend beyond the Syrian-Turkish border into the interior of the country. On April 2, Israel bombed several Syrian military sites, including the Tiyas air base, known as T4, to prevent Ankara from establishing air defenses there. Israel cares deeply about its neighbors' skies. Last October, it launched an airstrike against Iran that traveled through Syrian airspace.

Although Israel's security concerns are legitimate, it should do what it can to avoid military confrontation with Turkey. Israel must ensure that its relationship with Ankara does not become a casualty of its rush to harden its military position in Syria. With its forces spread thin and its international reputation at its nadir, the last thing Israel needs is a new enemy.

During the 1990s, amid hope for Israeli-Palestinian peace, Israel enjoyed close relations with Turkey. But their relationship deteriorated as both countries became less secular. In 2010, for example, the Israeli military killed nine civilian activists and wounded 30—one of whom later died—when it intercepted a Turkish ship that tried break its naval blockade of the Gaza Strip, causing Turkey to downgrade diplomatic ties. Turkey has repeatedly accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. Last May, to protest Israel's operations in the strip, Erdogan announced a ban on trade with the country. Israelis, meanwhile, accuse Ankara of letting leaders of the militant Palestinian organization Hamas, such as Saleh Arouri, a former deputy head of the group's political bureau, plan attacks against Israel from Turkish soil. Yet for all their differences, neither Turkey nor Israel wants Iranian influence to return to Syria.

Turkey is clearly the power behind the new Syrian regime, largely because of its long-standing ties to HTS, and has helped Syria's new leaders plan for reconstruction. Ankara also appears to be pursuing a defense pact with Syria that would expand Turkey's influence, currently concentrated in the north, to the rest of the country.

Israel is deeply alarmed by this trajectory. Two competing schools of thought have emerged on how to manage relations with Syria's new regime. One set of Israeli officials holds that Israel should try working with Shara before deciding that he is an enemy. But another set, which includes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, believes that a moderate, centralized Syrian government is unlikely to emerge under Sunni Islamist leadership and that Israel should prepare itself for hostility by establishing informal spheres of influence.

After Assad fled Damascus in December, Israel captured a buffer zone in southwestern Syria, adjacent to the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. Since December, Israel has bombed hundreds of Syrian military sites that it fears will be used by Syria's new government. And on March 11, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Israeli forces would stay in Syria for “an indefinite period” to protect communities in northern Israel.

Israel's incursion into Syria seems to be driven in part by a desire to avoid repeating mistakes that culminated in the devastating attacks of October 7, 2023. Israeli leaders now see buffer zones as essential and hope to actively shape neighboring countries' security environments rather than merely react to developments. The October 7 catastrophe has also led them to be wary of working with Islamists of any stripe. For years, Israel tolerated the presence of Hamas's leader, Yahya Sinwar, in Gaza. Sinwar cultivated a reputation as a sometime pragmatist by keeping his distance from Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a more militant terror group, and allowing a number of Gazans to work inside Israel. But ultimately, Sinwar orchestrated the deadliest attack Israel has ever suffered.

The lesson that Israeli officials appear to have taken is that they cannot tolerate any jihadists near their borders. After Syrian forces clashed with pro-Assad Alawite insurgents in March, resulting in several hundreds of deaths, Katz said that Shara had “taken off the mask and exposed his true face: a jihadist terrorist of the al-Qaeda school.” Although Shara has jihadist roots—HTS began as an offshoot of al-Qaeda— he has publicly renounced extremism, stating that he does not seek confrontation with Israel. But the Israeli leaders who expect an adversarial regime to consolidate in Damascus believe that Shara will say anything to get sanctions relief. They fear he will change his tune after he improves Syria's dire economic conditions.



Yet October 7 is only part of the story. Netanyahu has also said that his strategy is driven by a wish to protect the Druze religious minority in southern Syria. Last week, over 100 Syrians died in clashes between Sunni Islamist fighters and Druze gunmen. On May 2, Israel bombed Damascus; Netanyahu and Katz declared that they would “not allow forces to be sent south of Damascus or any threat to the Druze community.”

Israel's approach to Syria is also influenced by concern about the durability of the U.S. military's presence in the country. On December 8, the incoming President Donald Trump declared on social media that “Syria is a mess” and that “THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.” On April 18, the U.S. government announced that it would reduce the number of troops it has stationed in eastern Syria from around 2,000 to under 1,000. Israel fears that U.S. disengagement will allow Turkey to become more dominant in northern Syria—and possibly beyond.

But Israel should take care to avoid turning Turkey or Syria into an enemy and leave room for dialogue. It is valid for Israeli leaders to want to learn lessons from the strategic failures of October 7, but they have to balance security considerations with a long-term strategy. Israel might set clear benchmarks for Shara's government on how it treats minorities and addresses issues such as weapons smuggling and chemical weapons disposal. If these benchmarks are met, Israel could then consider calling upon the United States and European countries to ease sanctions on Syria. Israel might also encourage European and Gulf states to invest there. Further, Israel should state explicitly that it has no territorial claims over Syria and that its buffer zone will be temporary, as long as the new government meets certain standards. An ongoing Israeli presence in Syria would strengthen the case of Israel's adversaries who claim that Israel is an occupier.

Israel's relationship with the new Syrian government is crucial, but even more pressing is its relationship with Turkey. Both countries are U.S. allies with potent military capabilities. The Israeli bombing of T4 was a glaring reminder of how quickly things can escalate. The two countries should consider establishing redlines. At a minimum, they should agree to operate within different zones of influence in Syria so they can avoid hostilities.

Trump is confident that he can improve Israeli-Turkish ties and has told Netanyahu he has a “very good relationship with Turkey and with their leader.” Trump should dissuade Erdogan from deploying air defenses in Syria. Trump could also help Israel and Turkey find ways to deconflict. They might, for example, cooperate in countering Iranian influence and weapons smuggling.

Israel must use its defense and intelligence channels to communicate with Turkey and backchannels to talk with Syrians. So far, there has been at least one publicly confirmed meeting between Israeli and Turkish officials, which took place in April in Azerbaijan. Turkey and Israel should build on this dialogue, especially because both say they do not want a military confrontation with each other. Israel's goal should be to assert legitimate security concerns without antagonizing Ankara or Damascus. This balancing act is especially important during Syria's extraordinary period of flux. The new regime has not yet cemented its control over the country, and its political positions seem malleable. At this stunning moment in history—after the weakening of their mutual enemy Iran—Israel and Turkey should be striving to craft a mutually beneficial new regional order, not coming to blows.

In June 2024, at a national science and technology conference, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that the high-tech sector had become “the frontline and main battlefield of international competition, profoundly reshaping the global order and the pattern of development.” He is, of course, absolutely right. The United States and China compete for economic, military, and diplomatic dominance through the development of new technologies, including those with both military and civilian applications.

China is an increasingly formidable rival on this front. Since announcing the “Made in China 2025” plan in 2015, Beijing has invested in a whole-of-government focus on advancing critical emerging technologies. Now, China is giving the United States a run for its money. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Chinese automaker BYD surpassed Tesla in sales of battery electric vehicles. In addition to being bigger than Tesla, BYD is arguably more inventive, with vehicles that can slide sideways into parking spots and float during emergencies, and chargers that can replenish up to 250 miles of range in a mere five minutes—several times faster than Tesla superchargers. The state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China also intends to rival U.S. leaders in the aerospace manufacturing field; this March, the company released plans for a long-range supersonic jet that produces supersonic booms no louder than a hairdryer. Also in March, Beijing sent quantum-encrypted images to South Africa using a small, cheap satellite—an enormous advance in quantum communications. Chinese biotech companies are competing with their U.S. counterparts in creating new drugs. And as the energy demands of artificial intelligence make fusion power—a potentially massive source of carbon-free electricity—even more desirable, China has more new public fusion projects, fusion patents, and fusion Ph.D.s than any other country.

Much of the U.S. government response to this increasing competition in recent years has been protectionist, including tariffs on electric vehicles, curbs on Chinese investments in strategic sectors, and export controls on the GPU chips and chipmaking equipment used for advanced artificial intelligence. But the success of the Chinese AI company DeepSeek, spun out of a Chinese hedge fund, has made clear that this approach is ultimately futile. In January, DeepSeek launched a high-quality AI tool that it developed without access to the enormous number of high-end GPUs thought to be required for such a model. Sooner or later, China is going to invent its way around whatever roadblocks Washington imposes.

That's why it is so important that the United States not let up on its own innovation. When the government in Beijing decides that China must lead in a certain technology, resources are not an issue, and neither is short-term profitability. Washington, on the other hand, traditionally respects market forces and opposes government-led industrial policy. On the battlefield of technology, Americans must both continue to do what they do best and find new ways to improve competitiveness.

Since World War II, the United States has regularly created and commercialized groundbreaking technologies. But that success should not be taken for granted. Through its recent initiatives to cut federal funds for university research, the Trump administration risks draining a crucial source of new ideas for industry and the military, even as the geopolitical threats it faces continue to grow. To avert scientific and technological stagnation, the United States must significantly increase public investments in university-based research, ensure that it capitalizes on discoveries that emerge from academia, and devise sensible immigration policies that allow the world's best students to study and then work in the United States. Right now, however, the administration seems hell-bent on damaging, rather than fostering, this crucial source of American strength.

One thing the United States has done best over the past eight decades is invent foundational technologies. The wellspring of that innovation is very often U.S. research universities. Many of the most significant technologies of our day—including the Internet, the artificial neural networks that enable generative AI, quantum computing, nucleic acid sequencing, DNA amplification, CRISPR genome editing, mRNA vaccines and therapeutics, 3D printing, and checkpoint inhibitors for cancer treatment—arose from pioneering explorations in U.S. university laboratories. These university-based discoveries and inventions then led to the creation of startups and/or were taken up by existing tech companies that invested in and developed them further to bring them to market.

The best innovation tends to occur where the best science occurs. In other words, science advances knowledge, and this advanced knowledge creates new ideas, tools, and processes that enable and accelerate innovation—and that further advance knowledge. As of 2021, the United States still invested far more than any other nation in the conduct of basic scientific research. Universities were by far the largest performers of such research, and the federal government was its largest supporter. The spillover effects for the U.S. economy have been enormous.

A May 2023 analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas found that U.S. government support for nondefense research and development has accounted for at least one-fifth of total factor productivity growth in the U.S. business sector since World War II—a far greater return than federal investments in infrastructure have yielded or than private R & D has produced. (Most industry research is inevitably more focused on narrower questions with nearer-term commercial benefits.) But despite the centrality of university-based research to the United States' high-tech economy and the federal government's role in such research, in recent decades government support has become increasingly lackluster. Although the dollars spent have increased in real terms, as a percentage of the federal budget, R & D has fallen from over ten percent in the mid-1960s, when the United States was competing with the Soviet Union, to a meager three percent today, when the United States is facing a much more adept competitor in China. And under the current administration, the funding devoted to research is likely to be cut dramatically.



As the federal government's share of academic research funding has declined—from 61 percent in 2012 to 55 percent in 2021—U.S. universities have increased the share of their own funds spent on research, including endowment income, from 21 percent in 2012 to 25 percent in 2021. But income from even the largest endowment cannot replace the loss of federal funds to academic R & D, which amounted to nearly $60 billion in fiscal year 2023. In 2021, the United States ranked 23rd among 32 nations reporting to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in terms of academic spending on R & D as a percentage of GDP.

The 2022 CHIPS and Science Act was designed to correct some of this underinvestment, with $200 billion authorized for R & D and workforce and economic development. The budget of the National Science Foundation, which supports nonmedical academic research in the United States, was supposed to double by 2027. Instead, Congress never fully appropriated the funds, and the agency's budget was cut in 2024 and kept flat this year.

China, in contrast, announced earlier this year a ten percent increase to its central government science and technology spending and an increased focus on basic research. Many of Beijing's political leaders earned degrees from Tsinghua University, often referred to as “China's MIT.” These officials understand science and technology and its impact on all else. As a result, Chinese leaders view universities as key to the country's “national rejuvenation” and technological self-reliance, and they have tripled the country's number of higher education institutions since 1998. Over the past two decades, China has produced more Ph.D.s in STEM fields than the United States, and in 2016, China exceeded the United States in research publications for the first time. China is not merely increasing the scale of its inputs to innovation but also their quality. In the 2016 Nature Index, which tracks scientific output, five of the world's top ten academic institutions generating high-quality research were American and one was Chinese. In the most recent index, from 2024, the roles had reversed: eight of the world's top ten were Chinese and two were American.

Today, the Trump administration is allowing scientific discovery and technological innovation to become collateral damage amid a culture war on universities. Vice President JD Vance has explained the political impetus for upending U.S. universities very clearly in a February 2024 interview with The European Conservative: “We should be really aggressively reforming them in a way to where they're much more open to conservative ideas.” But is the perceived liberal bent of universities a reason to sow chaos in a research system that is key to U.S. national competitiveness? If a researcher can find a way to prevent cancer or Alzheimer's, it should not matter whether they are conservative or liberal.

In just a few months in office, the Trump administration has already managed to inflict a remarkable amount of damage on the country's research enterprise—damage that will have lasting effects. This includes hollowing out research agency staffs and freezing the process by which grants are awarded. The administration has also canceled already-awarded grants deemed to be in violation of executive orders, such as those related to gender identity or diversity, equity, and inclusion, or at disfavored institutions such as Columbia University. Most sweeping are the structural changes in the funding system for university research. The Trump administration has tried to cap reimbursement at the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Energy, and the National Science Foundation for the indirect costs of research—including the costs of maintaining and operating buildings and providing information infrastructure for laboratories—at 15 percent, which does not reflect the real costs shouldered by leading universities. Although the courts have halted this policy change thus far, if the administration is able to proceed, the country's greatest research universities will be severely harmed. Trump's proposed 2026 budget would starve U.S. science, including by cutting the budget of the National Institutes of Health by about 40 percent and that of the National Science Foundation by roughly 57 percent. Proposals to tax university endowment income at 14 or 21 percent—or to take away universities' tax-exempt status—would hobble those universities hoping to make up some of the difference with their own funds.

The Trump administration is imposing costs not only on universities' budgets but also on their recruitment. The United States has long benefited from an enormous brain gain, with the most talented scientists and engineers around the world coming to U.S. research universities to teach and to learn. But with its funding cuts, academic censorship, and hostile immigration policies, the Trump administration is provoking a brain drain. Three-quarters of the respondents to a recent poll of U.S. researchers by the journal Nature said that they were considering leaving the United States because of the Trump administration disruptions to science. European universities are now gladly recruiting that U.S. scientific talent. Research centers in cities including Barcelona and Madrid are reporting dozens of applications from U.S. scientists. Promising and distinguished researchers of Chinese origin in fields essential to U.S. competitiveness—artificial intelligence, robotics, mathematics, and nuclear fusion—are leaving leading U.S. research universities to return to China. This outflow is an acceleration of the exodus of Chinese-born scientists that began during the first Trump administration, when U.S. academics of Chinese descent were targeted unfairly for prosecution by the Department of Justice's China Initiative.



Freezes and cuts in research funding have also had an immediate impact on the next generation of talent. Research universities are limiting the number of graduate students they admit and postdoctoral researchers they hire and are even rescinding offers they already made. The National Science Foundation has cut the number of graduate fellowships it offers in half. In a survey of postdoctoral researchers conducted by the National Postdoctoral Association at the end of the first six weeks of Trump's second term, 43 percent of respondents said that their position was “threatened,” and 35 percent said that their research was “delayed or otherwise in jeopardy.” Some of these young people may be driven out of science entirely.

The detention and potential deportation of international graduate students and the revocation of student visas, sometimes without explanation, is likely to make the United States a much less desirable destination for the world's best students and therefore weaken American leadership in emerging technologies. Nationwide, international students earn 64 percent of doctorates in computer and information sciences, 57 percent of those in engineering, and 54 percent of those in mathematics and statistics. The United States clearly could do a better job of developing homegrown talent for these fields, but it is important to recognize how much the country gains by attracting brilliant people from around the world. The overwhelming majority of international doctoral students educated in the United States intend to stay on in the United States after earning their degrees, including more than three out of four doctoral recipients from China. And these students contribute to the U.S. economy; the National Foundation for American Policy's most recent analysis found that 25 percent of U.S. billion-dollar startup companies have a founder who came to the country as an international student. But increasingly, the best international students have other choices. Tsinghua University and Peking University are now 12th and 13th, respectively, on the Times Higher Education world university rankings. Peking is rated first in the world for its AI research output, and Tsinghua is second.

Fraught confrontations at U.S. borders are now reportedly making foreign scientists hesitate before coming to scientific conferences. In March, for example, a French scientist who works in space research was detained and denied entry when attempting to travel to a conference near Houston. U.S. officials claimed that he was turned away because he had confidential information from Los Alamos National Laboratory, but French officials said that he was denied because his phone contained messages critical of the Trump administration's science policies. If the United States cannot even convene the world's best scientists, it will struggle to preserve the open exchange and free inquiry that it has championed for so long—and that science thrives on.

The Trump administration seems to be taking U.S. leadership in science and technology for granted. Doing so would be a dangerous mistake. Americans are accustomed to U.S. companies delivering astonishing innovations with regularity, including the iPhone, cloud computing, the Tesla Model S, and ChatGPT. And there are certain aspects of U.S. history and culture that have encouraged inventiveness and risk-taking. But the United States did not become the world's leading scientific and technological superpower because its people are somehow innately smarter and more creative than those in the rest of the world. It became a leader because it has had the world's best system for science and innovation—a system that is now under attack from the Trump administration.

The modern research university is a German invention, dating back to the early nineteenth century, when the intellectual founders of the Humboldt University of Berlin argued for the linking of teaching and research, for expanding academic freedom, and for the idea that research should be pursued without a view of immediate utility. They believed that the state should support such explorations—but not direct them. This model was so appealing that, in the nineteenth century, it was Germany that welcomed the world's best and brightest: about 10,000 U.S. scholars earned their doctorates or other advanced degrees in German universities. Some of those German-educated Americans founded the first U.S. research university, Johns Hopkins, in 1876.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the university where I work and served as president, began operating in 1865 on a different model, the polytechnic model. It focused on applied science and engineering rather than on theory, aiming to produce technically trained graduates for a young, industrializing country. MIT did not initially have the funds or the interest to do much research, but in the early years of the twentieth century, after taking an academic tour through Germany, MIT President Henry Pritchett returned with the conviction that MIT should do more than teach. He established the university's first major research laboratories.

MIT quickly became a powerhouse in applied research done to benefit U.S. industry and society. And it was often conducted in partnership with the leading U.S. companies at that time, including AT&T and General Electric. The federal government was not yet in the business of funding university research. Although industry support was a matter of financial survival, the experience of working with industry made MIT particularly adept at moving its inventions into the marketplace. By the 1920s, MIT's leaders and alumni began to worry that a commercial focus was limiting the university's reach. In 1930, the institute recruited as its president the nuclear physicist Karl Compton. Compton had argued in 1927 that university research should not be focused merely on industry; he believed that universities were, in fact, the only places where pure science could be investigated without the pressures of commercialization. He also advocated that such research should be funded by taxes on any enterprise that profited from science.

It was not until World War II that the federal government devoted a large quantity of tax dollars to university-based research, thanks to the leading engineer Vannevar Bush. Bush, while on the faculty at MIT, designed and built a pioneering analog computer. He also had a fantastic mind for science policy. After Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Bush persuaded U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt to create an organization to oversee research of interest to the military. In 1940, Roosevelt established the National Defense Research Committee with Bush as its leader. (Its power later expanded as it became the Office of Scientific Research and Development, with Bush still in charge.) MIT President Compton, a member of the committee, was put in charge of identifying technologies to detect German aircraft and ships—which led to the founding of the Radiation Lab at MIT. Named to deceive the Nazis, the laboratory was not focused on radioactive materials but on microwave radar systems—a technology that was arguably more important for the outcome of the war than even the atom bomb. Leading scientists, a number of whom would go on to win Nobel Prizes, were recruited from around the country to the Rad Lab. Over the next five years at MIT, more than 100 radar systems were developed to counteract the threat of German U-boats and V-1 flying bombs.



With federal funding, universities across the country were able to devote time and effort to wartime projects. The University of Chicago, Columbia, and the University of California, Berkeley, conducted initial research for the Manhattan Project, and many leading universities lent their talent to it. The California Institute of Technology worked on rocketry. Harvard researched how to use sonar against Nazi submarines and how to muffle noise in long-range bombers, contributing to the development of fiberglass. In 1942, Johns Hopkins launched its Applied Physics Laboratory, which developed the proximity fuse—another crucial technological innovation for the Allied victory—and which later, during the Sputnik era, developed the concept for GPS.

After Germany surrendered, Bush presented a landmark report to U.S. President Harry Truman titled Science: The Endless Frontier, in which he argued for the continuation of federal support for university-based research. Bush cited how decisive government-funded science had been to the Allied victory, including the development of scalable penicillin production, saving lives. And, as he pointed out, the United States could no longer rely on a “ravaged Europe” for fundamental discovery science as it had in the past. Bush's argument for the peacetime federal funding of research and scientific education was not only about national security and public health but also about economic growth. As he saw it, by continuing to “study nature's laws,” the United States could create new manufacturing industries and expand old ones—an assessment that turned out to be prescient. Just over a decade later, the MIT economist Robert Solow published groundbreaking research establishing that modern economic growth depends on technological advancements and not exclusively on capital and labor, as the classical paradigm had held—work for which he would win a Nobel Prize.

Bush had a linear view of innovation: the federal government would give universities funds for basic research projects inspired by curiosity and not profit. These projects trained brilliant students and produced discoveries; industry would then develop those discoveries and find practical applications for them.

Although Bush's ideas were not implemented precisely as he envisioned, the government continued to provide federal support for university research after the war, helping turn the United States into the world's dominant scientific and technological power, producing a unique concentration of world-class research universities, and making the country a magnet for the best STEM talent from around the world. Under this model, leading U.S. research universities both supported existing industries and became hotbeds of entrepreneurship themselves. In 2011, a study at Stanford University calculated that since the 1930s, its alumni and faculty had started nearly 40,000 companies that employed 5.4 million people and generated $2.7 trillion in annual revenues, putting Stanford among the world's ten largest economies. A similar MIT analysis found that as of 2014, MIT's living alumni had founded over 30,000 companies that employed 4.6 million people and generated nearly $2 trillion in annual revenues. The Bush model could certainly use some updating—and expansion—for a world in which China is pulling ahead of the United States in science and technology. But it is hard to see anything in this model that demands to be torn down.

Most Americans today were born long after Bush and The Endless Frontier. Throughout their lives, the United States has dominated in science, technology, industry, innovation, and culture, and they may assume that this is the natural order of things. But if the United States can no longer afford to conduct the productive explorations enabled by government investment, it will lose the technological race with China. Its military will suffer, because it depends on technologically advanced commercial products that the defense market alone cannot support. It will also see less growth among high-tech entrepreneurs. A 2021 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research confirmed the strong connection between increases in federal research support for a university and the formation nearby of startups with significant potential for growth. Another paper, published in 2020, detailed that university researchers who experienced large cuts in federal research funding are 80 percent less likely to launch a high-tech startup.

Shoring up U.S. leadership in scientific innovation will require three things. First, the country must make public investments in university-based research that are commensurate with the geopolitical threats it faces. This should include “use inspired” basic research, which takes place at the frontiers of science but is directed toward overcoming particular obstacles in U.S. economic or national security, as was the case at MIT's Rad Lab. Appropriating the funds already approved by Congress for the “science” part of the CHIPS and Science Act would be a terrific start. The United States will also need to design immigration policies that allow its research universities to continue attracting the world's best science and engineering students and that allow those students to contribute to U.S. competitiveness by remaining in the country after they finish their education.



Finally, the country needs to do a much better job of capturing the value of the discoveries and inventions made at U.S. universities, rather than allowing a lack of patient capital to drive critical technology manufacturing and development elsewhere. For example, a company named A123—spun out of the MIT Professor Yet-Ming Chiang's laboratory in 2001—was the first to commercialize a superior lithium-ion battery chemistry for electric vehicles. But because the U.S. market for EVs was not sufficiently developed for the company to become profitable, A123 declared bankruptcy in 2012 and was bought by a Chinese auto parts company. Today, China dominates lithium-ion battery manufacturing. This is a foundational enabling technology of the kind the United States should have supported until it could stand on its own in the marketplace. At MIT, about a decade ago, I became deeply concerned about this very issue—that some of the most groundbreaking science-based inventions emerging from our laboratories, despite their huge potential to benefit society, were not advancing to commercialization. The timeline to market for risky new technologies in fields such as regenerative medicine and clean energy is simply too long for most private investors—there is a reason that 39 percent of U.S. venture dollars go to software startups and just two percent go to energy startups. So MIT decided to create a combination accelerator and patient venture capital fund, called “The Engine,” for such “tough tech.” The Engine offers initial support to startups that have included Commonwealth Fusion Systems, a company that uses high-temperature superconducting magnets to develop small, low-cost fusion power systems. In December, the company announced that it will be building the world's first grid-scale commercial fusion power plant in Virginia and expects to have it running by the early 2030s. But The Engine is just one investment organization—and the United States needs many more. Although the CHIPS and Science Act authorized the National Science Foundation to help launch similar organizations, Congress has not yet funded this endeavor.

American universities are not perfect. But many of them are extremely successful institutions by global standards, and the country depends on them. To defund universities because of faults that have nothing to do with research is to recklessly shut off the spigot to innovation.

Just as the center of gravity in science and technology moved away from Europe to the United States during the twentieth century, it can also move to Asia in the twenty-first. The economies of Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea approach or surpass the United States in the proportion of GDP they devote to R & D, and China is working hard to catch up. India, which ranks third in the number of research publications produced globally, is poised to advance in science by the end of the decade (as it also becomes the world's third-largest economy). U.S. government policies that fail to comprehend the importance of advancing science and technology are hastening this transition.

The United States, once solidly on the frontlines of technology, is now on its way to becoming a much weaker player. And so far, it is responding to this decline by taking steps that will only weaken it further. There has never been anything inevitable about U.S. leadership in science and technology. What is inevitable is that if Washington does not work to maintain its lead on this battlefield, others will take its place.

            Barstool Sports' founder said he would send two customers to tour a former Nazi concentration camp after they allegedly engaged in antisemitic behavior at a Barstool pub in Philadelphia, then later retracted that offer for at least one of them because he said the person was denying responsibility for what happened.

Temple University student suspended after an antisemitic sign is posted at Barstool sports bar owned by Dave Portnoy



            Dave Portnoy said in posts on social media that in an initial conversation Sunday the customer took 100% responsibility for his actions with his friend and agreed to take a learning trip to Auschwitz in Poland. But on Monday, Portnoy posted that the customer “did a 180” and told him he had nothing to do with the antisemitic behavior and he was just being a citizen journalist by sharing video of what happened.
    


            “His trip to Poland has been revoked,” Portnoy said in the post. “Whatever ramifications come his way he 100% earned.”
    


            It wasn't clear if the trip had been revoked for the other customer.
    


            Portnoy, who is Jewish, said he has experienced increased antisemitism, as the war between Israel and Hamas continues.
    


            In a video posted on social media Saturday night, a woman at the bar who appears to be a server holds a sign with an anti-Jewish message on it while a man repeats the message multiple times.

            The bar said in a statement posted to social media that several employees, against their training and organization's written discrimination policies, complied with a customer's request for the sign in connection with ordering bottle service.
    


            “We are saddened, embarrassed, and frustrated by the deplorable actions of a customer and misguided staff,” Barstool Samson Street said in the post.
    


            Portnoy said two bar employees had been fired over the incident.
    


            Philadelphia police said they were investigating. No charges were immediately filed.
    


            Temple University said one of the customers is believed to be one of their students. The student was put on interim suspension while an investigation continues, President John Fry said in a statement posted on the university's website.

            Fry called antisemitism “abhorrent” and said he would take further action if other students were involved.
    


            “It has no place at Temple and acts of hatred and discrimination against any person or persons are not tolerated at this university,” Fry said.
    


            Kappa Delta Rho said in a post on its website that it is also investigating because the customer involved was allegedly a member of their fraternity at Temple.
    


            “To be clear, our organization firmly opposes all forms of hate, which have no place in our fraternity,” said Xavier Romano, executive director of the national fraternity.
    


            Portnoy had said he hoped to turn the event into a teachable moment. He did not initially identify the culprits but identified one of them on Monday when saying he would not be sending them to Auschwitz. The customer didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
    


            He founded Barstool Sports in 2003, a digital platform covering sports, lifestyle and entertainment, in the Boston area. He also owns several Barstool bars in locations around the country.

            One of America's closest allies recently raised eyebrows for threatening to fire off the ultimate financial weapon against Washington in trade talks: dumping US debt.
    


            Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato, whose country is the biggest holder of US Treasuries, said on Friday that selling the assets is a “card on the table” in tariff negotiations, according to The Associated Press.



            “It does exist as a card, but I think whether we choose to use it or not would be a separate decision,” Kato said.

The clock is ticking down to zero, and Trump needs a trade deal — badly



            Two days later, the Japanese official walked back the comment, stressing on Sunday that the longtime US ally is “not considering the sale of US Treasuries as a means of Japan-US negotiations.”
    


            Japan was unlikely to fire this big bazooka in the trade war anyway, since selling US Treasuries is considered an extreme move — one that would likely backfire, experts say. Still, the short-lived threat raises an ugly truth: The United States relies on other countries buying its $36 trillion mountain of debt.
    


            It's another way that President Donald Trump's aggressive trade war could hurt the American economy: Tariffs have the potential to reduce the amount of capital seeking a home in American assets, which could lift interest rates and hurt the value of the US dollar. Even if a large-scale Treasury selloff is unlikely, other nations — including one of America's closest allies — are clearly considering all options.
    


            As America's biggest foreign creditor, Japan sits on $1.1 trillion of US Treasuries. That gives Tokyo some leverage as it seeks to hammer out a trade deal with the White House.
    


            If Japan sold massive amounts of US debt, it would very likely spark a massive Treasury selloff. Treasury rates would in turn sharply increase, making it more expensive for Washington to borrow and freaking out investors along the way.
    


            “It would send shockwaves around world financial markets if one of the most reliable buyers of Treasuries is no longer reliably in the market for it,” said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale and a chief economist in the Biden administration.
    


            Recall that fears of a bond market catastrophe helped convince Trump to pause so-called “reciprocal tariffs” on April 9.
    


            And Washington doesn't just rely on Japan to buy its debt.
    


            China has been slapped with tariffs of at least 145% on most goods, but it is also America's second-biggest foreign creditor, with $784 billion of Treasuries as of February, according to federal data.



            The United Kingdom, which faces a 10% tariff, is America's third-largest foreign creditor, with $750 billion of US Treasuries. And the sixth-biggest holder of US Treasuries, Canada, is being threatened with more tariffs if it does not join the United States as the 51st state.
    


            But for these nations, dumping US debt, especially in a fire sale, would risk destabilizing global markets as well as their own.

            Moreover, it would hurt their own investments and that of their banks and citizens. Their own currencies could also sharply increase in value, making it harder to sell their goods overseas.
    


            “Threatening to dump an asset of which it is a major holder means that Japan can hurt itself in the process,” Win Thin, global head of market strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. He wrote that this kind of threat is “always a double-edged sword.”
    


            Maury Obstfeld, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNN that Japan's comments seem “very rash” and amount to “just a silly response.”
    


            “No one wants to sell a lot of Treasuries quickly because they would take losses on their entire portfolio, and Japan's is vast,” Obstfeld said. “This would also invite massive tariff retaliation.”
    


            Moreover, as Obstfeld notes, Japan needs Washington to defend itself in the volatile Asia-Pacific region. It wouldn't want to do anything to cast doubt on that support from the American military.
    


            “The fact is that US Treasuries are so central to world financial markets that it's really hard to damage the United States – without hurting yourself in the process,” said Yale's Tedeschi.
    


            Still, the warning from Japan does speak to a broader issue.
    


            “Both theory and data show that trade tariffs reduce net capital inflows,” said Kent Smetters, professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
    


            Smetters, who runs the Penn Wharton Budget Model, noted that capital was indeed leaving the United States and rates were rising before Trump announced his pause on reciprocal tariffs.
    


            “If the tariffs are fully implemented, the US will need to sell its future debt… at lower prices and higher yields,” Smetters said. “More tax cuts, instead of helping offset some of the negative effects of tariffs, will add to the debt at a time when it will become more costly to do so.”

            Ahead of a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee, former Vice President Kamala Harris made a surprise appearance at the Met Gala in New York, along with husband Doug Emhoff, wearing a custom black-and-white gown by Off-White.
    


            Though they skipped the red carpet, Harris appears in photos ahead of the event wearing an elegant silk silhouette with an asymmetrical cape sleeve and a long scarf — a look meant to evoke a sense of timelessness, according to the luxury label.
    


            The former vice president was invited by Vogue editor-in-chief and Met Gala co-chair Anna Wintour, according to a spokesperson for Harris. She has made few high-profile appearances since losing the presidential election in November, though she has recently given two speeches at the Leading Women Defined Summit and Emerge Gala, the latter of which benefits an organization that recruits and trains women to run for office. In both, Harris has rebuked US President Trump's first 100 days in office.
    


            “Instead of an administration working to advance America's highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals,” she said at the Emerge Gala last Wednesday. “And what we are also seeing in these last 14 weeks is Americans using their voice and showing their courage.”
    


            Over the course of her vice presidency, Harris' fashion choices often evoked subtle symbolism, from the suffrage-associated white suit and pussybow blouse she wore as she stepped into the role, to a tan Chloé suit at last year's Democratic National Convention that seemed to be a playful nod to former President Obama. The former vice president also appeared on the cover of Vogue twice, with her first portrait igniting debate over her more casual demeanor in a black jacket and Converse sneakers, photographed by Tyler Mitchell.

            At the Met Gala, Harris celebrated the spirit of the Costume Institute's exhibition “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” in her look from Off-White. The show explores the exuberant and subversive history of Black dandyism, based on the landmark book “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,” by the show's guest curator and scholar Monica L. Miller. The exhibition on Black sartorial history is going on during an uncertain time for museums, as the Trump administration has made calls to end crucial federal funding for the arts and has targeted Smithsonian museums for their exhibitions on race and gender.
    


            “To me the true core of dandyism is rooted in confidence and strength. There is no person who exemplifies these characteristics more than Kamala D. Harris, someone who has overcome adversity and continues to be a beacon for so many,” Off-White creative director IB Kamara said in a statement shared with CNN.
    


            The night marks her first appearance at the Met Gala, though she's far from the only politician to grace the museum's steps during fashion's biggest night out. In 2022, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attended the Met Gala for the first time in two decades wearing a red Altuzarra gown embroidered with the names of trailblazing American women, including Harriet Tubman and Eleanor Roosevelt. The year prior, US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made a splashy statement in a white Brother Vellies gown emblazoned with “Tax the Rich” in red.
    


            Wintour has said, however, that US President Trump is persona non grata at the event. In 2017, during his first term, the Vogue editor told James Corden on his late-night talk show that he is one person she would “never invite back.”

Follow:


            Two vehicles collided head-on and burst into flames on a two-lane highway in rural eastern Kansas, killing eight people, including a high school student, a teacher-coach and a school employee from Oklahoma, authorities said Monday.
    


            The crash occurred at about 5:45 p.m. Sunday on U.S. 169 outside the small town of Greeley, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) southwest of Kansas City, Missouri, the Kansas Highway Patrol said. One person escaped from a wrecked vehicle and was hospitalized.
    


            Three of those killed were connected with Tulsa Public Schools, the school district confirmed Monday.
    


            Booker T. Washington High School student Donald “DJ” Laster died in the crash, along with former Carver Middle School coach and teacher Wayne Walls and Tulsa Public Schools transportation team member Ja'mon Gilstrap.
    


            “I am heartbroken for those who lost loved ones, and committed to honoring the immense collective impact each of these people had in Tulsa and in the lives of our young people,” Dr. Ebony Johnson, superintendent of Tulsa Public Schools, said in a statement. “I am praying for their families and everyone involved, and hope others will continue to come alongside our students, team members, and families who are hurting.”
    


            The crash closed a section of the highway for four hours, and Kansas Highway Patrol Trooper Jodi Clary said authorities were still working at the crash site Monday evening. The cause of the crash remained under investigation.
    


            “Both cars burned up,” Clary said.

Follow:


            The fate of President Donald Trump's controversial nominee to serve as US attorney for Washington, DC, is in question as the president has been making calls to Republican senators on his behalf, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation.
    


            Ed Martin did not appear on the agenda for the Senate Judiciary Committee's meeting Thursday – a key deadline for him to be confirmed by May 20, when his interim position expires.
    


            The White House, though, is not throwing in the towel, according to a source familiar with the process. Despite Martin's diminishing odds that his nomination will advance to see a full Senate vote, Trump officials are consulting with legislative advisors on possible next steps to try to move his nomination forward.
    


            The White House and Department of Justice have shepherded Martin through what has so far been a turbulent confirmation, including helping him complete mandated disclosure forms and other paperwork.
    


            But Trump, whose calls on Martin's behalf have not been previously reported, may be needed to convince a handful of skeptical Republicans who are putting the nomination at risk.
    


            As CNN previously reported, Martin failed to disclose nearly 200 media appearances in his initial disclosures last month, and claimed under oath he did not recall some of his most controversial past statements in response to a series of questions put to him by members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
    


            Facing a potential collision course over one of Trump's favorite nominees and up against a ticking clock, a number of GOP senators have expressed concerns over Martin's past controversies.
    


            A committee vote on Martin's nomination has not yet been scheduled. Still, the White House remains confident that Martin will get confirmed, according to a person familiar with the situation.
    


            Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee in charge of Martin's nomination, said last week that Republicans needed more time to vet Martin and meet with him – a nod to the growing angst behind the scenes.
    


            North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN last week he has “serious questions” about Martin, given his previous comments denigrating police officers who defended the US Capitol during the January 6, 2021, attack.
    


            “I don't talk about that stuff,” Tillis said when asked if the president had reached out to him.
    


            GOP Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, who also serve on the panel, have also privately expressed concerns about supporting Martin, a source familiar with the process told CNN. Cornyn told CNN on Monday that Trump had not reached out to him, and he declined to  say how he would vote on the nomination.
    


            Grassley told CNN last week that his panel still had not received the necessary paperwork from the FBI to move forward with Martin's nomination. However, a committee aide told CNN Monday that all outstanding materials on Martin have now been received, including the FBI materials Grassley was waiting on.
    


            Trump and his allies have a short window to get Martin over the finish line. If Republicans don't confirm him by May 20, there would be a new process to play out in picking a new nominee.
    


            One option could be US District Judge James Boasberg appointing someone to become DC's top prosecutor. Boasberg, a Barack Obama appointee, has presided over a number of high-profile cases challenging Trump policies, drawing the ire of the president and his allies.
    


            After this story published on Monday evening, Trump posted about Martin's confirmation battle on Truth Social writing that his “approval is IMPERATIVE.”
    


            Top Justice Department officials, who had preferred another candidate for the job, have had to caution Martin about some of his public activities since taking on the job on an interim basis, sources briefed on the matter told CNN.
    


            Despite growing blowback on the nomination, allies of Trump and Martin have made clear that the president has so far been thrilled with Martin's job performance.
    


            “Martin is President Trump's favorite US Attorney,” one source familiar with his nomination process previously told CNN.
    


            On top of Trump's direct calls to GOP senators, 23 Republican state attorneys general sent a letter to Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley and Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Monday urging them to move forward on Martin's confirmation, according to a copy shared with CNN. Trump ally Charlie Kirk also posted on X over the weekend about the need to successfully confirm Martin.
    


            DOJ officials who may have wanted someone else for the job have come to terms with the fact that he is Trump's pick and are doing everything they can to help get him confirmed, sources briefed on the matter told CNN.
    


            Martin has successfully implemented Trump's “law and order agenda” and been a “fantastic U.S. Attorney for D.C.,” said Alex Pfeiffer, White House principal deputy communications director. “The White House looks forward to his continued success in the role. Ed has shown he is the right man for the job.”
    


            Martin's nomination process has been riddled with controversies since the president formally nominated him to the job in March.
    


            Martin has had to update his mandated disclosure to Congress detailing all of his past media appearances at least three times after his initial filing  failed to report media appearances he's made in the past few years, including many on far-right outlets and Russian-state media. He has also had to answer for his previous praise of a Capitol rioter who is an alleged Nazi sympathizer, despite his more recent denouncement. And he did not recall some of his most controversial past statements in response to a series of questions under oath put to him by members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
    


            During his short tenure as acting US attorney, Martin has drawn attention for having referred to the nation's largest office of federal prosecutors as “President Trumps' [sic] lawyers,” and demoting senior attorneys who worked on January 6, 2021, Capitol riot cases.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Just as Japan's top trade negotiator traveled to Washington for another round of tariff talks last week, a bipartisan delegation bearing the name of “Japan-China Friendship” wrapped up a visit to Beijing.

A week earlier, the head of the junior party in Japan's ruling coalition was in Beijing delivering a letter from Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba addressed to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Details of the letter are unknown, but the two sides discussed U.S. tariffs in addition to bilateral issues.

Among all U.S. allies being wooed by Beijing in its tariff stare-down with Washington, Japan stands out. 

It is a peculiar case not only for its staunch commitment to its alliance with the United States but also for its complicated and uneasy history with the neighboring Asian giant — particularly the war history from the 20th century that still casts a shadow over the politics of today.

“On one hand, they are neighbors and they are important economic partners. There's a lot that connects Japan and China,” said Matthew Goodman, director of the Greenberg Center for Geoeconomics at the Council on Foreign Relations. “But on the other hand, I think there are limits to how far they're going to lean into China.” 

While Japan won't walk away from its alliance with the United States, the linchpin of the Asian country's diplomacy and security policies, “it's also true that the tariffs and uncertainty that Trump has created for Japan is really shaking things up in Tokyo,” Goodman said. 




Last month, President Donald Trump announced a 24% tariff on Japanese goods in a sweeping plan to levy duties on about 90 countries. The White House has since paused the tariffs but a 10% baseline duty on all countries except China, allowing time for negotiations. Still, Trump's 25% tax on aluminum, steel and auto exports have gone into effect for Japan.

The tariff moves, as well as Trump's “America First” agenda, have cast doubts among the Japanese if the United States is still a dependable ally, while China is rallying support from tariff-threatened countries — including Japan.

When Tetsuo Saito led Japan's Komeito Party delegation to Beijing in late April, China hinted at difficulty in its tariff dispute with the United States, signaling its willingness to improve ties with Tokyo. An unnamed senior Chinese official said his country was “in trouble” when discussing Trump's 145% tariff on Chinese products, according to Japanese reports.

Saito's visit was soon followed by that of the bipartisan delegation of Japan-China Friendship Parliamentarians' Union. Zhao Leji, Beijing's top legislator, told the delegation that China's National People's Congress would be “willing to carry out various forms of dialogue and exchanges.”

Beijing did not lift a ban on Japan's seafood imports as the Japanese delegates hoped, but it signaled positive signs on its assessment of the safety of the discharges of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Beijing banned Japan's seafood products in 2023, citing those concerns.

Ties between Tokyo and Beijing have long been rocky. In the past several years, they squabbled not only over the seafood ban but also long-standing territorial disputes over the Senkaku, or Diaoyu, islands in the East China Sea, Beijing's growing military assertiveness and violence against Japanese nationals in China — an issue complicated by the nations' uneasy history. 

Tokyo's closer ties with Washington during Joe Biden's presidency also upset Beijing, which saw it as part of the U.S. strategy to contain China and has lectured Tokyo to “face squarely and reflect on the history of aggression.”

An imperial power in Asia for centuries, China fell behind Japan in the 19th century when Japan began to embrace Western industrialization and grew into a formidable economic and military power. It invaded China in the 1930s and controlled the northeastern territory known as Manchuria. War atrocities, including the Nanking Massacre and the use of chemical and biological weapons and human medical experiments in Manchuria, have left deep scars in China. They have yet to be healed, though Japan's conservative politicians today still attempt to deny the aggression.

Ishiba, elected Japan's prime minister in October, has a more neutral view on his country's wartime history than the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his two successors. Weeks after taking office, Ishiba held talks with Xi on the sidelines of a leaders' summit.

Chinese scholars, however, see Tokyo's recent engagements with Beijing as a pragmatic move to hedge against U.S. protectionism and not a long-term strategy for stability with China.

The odds are low for Japan to move into China's orbit, Goodman said. “They have for a long time had to manage an important but challenging relationship with China,” he said. “And that is, again, a long-standing problem for Japan, going back centuries or millennia.”

While Japan might welcome the friendlier tone from Beijing, it is trying to stabilize Japan-U.S. relations under Trump's “America First” agenda, and it is hoping to settle the tariff dispute without confronting Washington, with an eye on preventing Beijing from exploiting any fallout in Japan-U.S. relations.

Japan was among the first countries to hold tariff talks with Washington. During the first round in mid-April, Trump inserted himself into the discussions, a sign of the high stakes for the United States to reach a deal with Japan. The Trump administration reportedly pushed for Japan to buy more U.S.-made cars and open its market to U.S. beef, rice and potatoes. 

After the second round of negotiation in Washington last week, Ryosei Akazawa, the country's chief tariff negotiator, said he pushed Japan's request that the U.S. drop tariffs and was continuing efforts toward an agreement acceptable to both sides. He said Japan's auto industry was already hurting from the 25% tariff and that he needed to be “thorough but fast.”

Asked about China, Akazawa said only that his country keeps watching the U.S.-China tariff development “with great interest.” He noted Japan's deep trade ties with China.

While China and Japan are working to mend ties, the two are also competing in the Southeast Asia region, where Trump has threatened high tariffs as well. The region is deeply integrated into China's supply chain but under pressure from the West to diversify and reduce its reliance on China. With younger and growing populations as compared to East Asia, the region is considered an important growth center.

Japan, as a major postwar development aid contributor, has gradually regained trust in the region, which also was scarred by Japan's World War II past.

On Wednesday, Ishiba returned from Vietnam and the Philippines after agreeing with their leaders to further strengthen security and economic ties. During the visit, Ishiba stressed Japan's commitment to maintaining and strengthening a multilateral free-trade system in each country. Ishiba also had telephone talks with his Malaysian and Singaporean counterparts earlier this month about U.S. tariffs.

Just weeks earlier, Xi was in Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia, also stressing free trade and seeking stronger supply chains. 

At a recent discussion at the Washington-based think tank Hudson Institute, Itsunori Onodera, Japan's governing party policy chief, warned of “very unstable” feelings among many Asian countries faced with high tariffs from the United States. 

“There's a danger they might become more distant and become closer to China,” Onodera said. “This is not something that Japan wants, either.”

NEW YORK (AP) — “Well, it took a minute,” said Spike Lee, surveying the glittering Met Gala crowd during cocktail hour through bright orange glasses that matched his New York Knicks cap. “But we're here now, that's the most important thing.”

Lee was referring to the fact that for the very first time, the Met Gala was making a point of celebrating Black style and Black designers — a milestone he felt was overdue, but very welcome.

“Long overdue,” Lee repeated. “But we're here to celebrate. And who knows what's gonna happen because of this event? There's gonna be reverberations around the world.”

Lee was echoing an excitement that many of the approximately 400 guests — luminaries in sports, music, fashion, film, theater and more — shared as they sipped cocktails or toured the gala's accompanying exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” The show is an exploration of Black menswear from the 18th century onward, with dandyism as a unifying theme.

Another film director, Baz Luhrmann, was touring the exhibit, designed by guest curator Monica L. Miller, a Barnard professor who literally wrote the book on dandyism: “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity.” Luhrmann, too, mused on the importance of this year's theme.

“Sometimes the subjects are fun, sometimes you go, that's interesting. But this is a subject where you go, why has light not been shone on this before?” Luhrmann said.




For Whoopi Goldberg, the most important person of the evening wasn't actually there. It was her late friend, André Leon Talley, the fashion editor who was so important to Black style, and with whom she'd attended previous galas.

Talley, who died in 2022, is honored in the exhibit; there's a caftan he wore, among other objects. And Costume Institute curator Andrew Bolton has said he was an inspiration for the show.

“I think they did him proud,” Goldberg said during cocktails. “I'm very happy to be here again, but spectacularly happy to see how they took care of him.”

Asked what Talley would have thought of the show, she guessed he'd say: “I'm glad you understand.” 

Goldberg was dressed head to toe — meaning mini-top hat to spats-inspired shoes, to handbag — in black-and-white Thom Browne.

“He said. ‘Will you come?'” Goldberg said of Browne, whose suits, particularly, are hugely popular. “And I said, when you're done, just put it on me, and I'm good. I feel incredible.”

It was a favored topic of conversation; every guest had a slightly different way of defining what a dandy is.

For Lee, it was simple: “Doing your own thing.”

For Audra McDonald, it was about “a sense of reclaiming” one's own identity and worth. The Broadway actor, currently starring in “Gypsy,” was among the first guests examining the exhibit, along with her husband and fellow actor, Will Swenson.

Over at cocktails, the Rev. Al Sharpton was describing dandyism as a form of activism: “It means to me that even in the midst of being in a socially limited situation, we celebrate. I refuse to submit to just having a menial job. I'm gonna dress up. I'm gonna tip my hat. It's a sense of rebellion, without having to speak it.”

Sharpton was full of praise for the Met having chosen this moment to honor Black style.

“It comes at a very important time,” he said. “To make a statement of diversity at the highest cultural level — which is the Met Gala — when diversity is under attack by the highest office in the land is more than if I could do a hundred marches. This is a monumental night.”

Colman Domingo, a co-chair who spoke movingly earlier Monday about how male relatives — his stepfather, father and brother — taught him about style, was yet more emotional at the gala, where he described dandyism as “a form of resistance.”

“It feels right on the money that I am in this moment,” said the 55 year-old actor, who recounted becoming more stylistically self-assured with each passing decade, and less concerned with what others think. “Being a host here, it's very meaningful.”

It was Broadway actor Alex Newell's third Met Gala in a row. This one had a special meaning, the performer noted.

“It's nice to see us represented this way,” Newell said. “Just when it is needed the most.”

Many also expressed deep pride in the fact that this year's gala brought in a record haul of more than $31 million, as Met officials confirmed on Monday.

Once gala guests climb the steps outside and enter the museum's Great Hall, they encounter each year a monumental centerpiece, usually floral. 

This year, it was thousands of flower petals suspended from the ceiling, with lighting evoking a starry sky. The petals also hung over the Great Hall staircase, which guests ascended to greet the awaiting receiving line of gala hosts.

The petals — made of fabric, truth be told — were meant to symbolize narcissus flowers, and there were also reflecting pools, nodding to the myth of Narcissus.

The greeting was not only visual but musical: An orchestra, accompanied by swaying singers, played favorites like Al Green's “Let's Stay Together” and Stevie Wonder's “Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing,”

Guests then either proceeded to view the exhibit, or head straight to cocktails in the airy Engelhard Court. Often, they seem to prefer socializing, but this year the exhibit was filled with guests.

One of the more famous dandies, historically speaking, was Oscar Wilde. And so there was symmetry in the fact that Sarah Snook — the “Succession” star — was dressed in a way Wilde would have liked.

It was certainly intentional. Snook now is appearing on Broadway in “The Picture of Dorian Gray,” the stage adaptation of Wilde's 1891 novel in which she plays all 26 roles.

“Yes, There's definitely an echo,” Snook said with a smile, about her striking (and aristocratic-looking) black satin tuxedo ensemble, by anOnlyChild. “Oscar would be happy.”

Snook said she was enjoying her night off at the gala — conveniently for the many guests from Broadway, theaters are dark on Mondays. “I'm loving the celebration of beautiful things,” she said.

It's safe to say milliners were very busy leading up to this gala. Hats, a key element of dandy style, were everywhere. Top hats like Goldberg's were especially popular, but then there were the wide-brimmed ones that threatened to shield a celebrity face just a bit too much. (Was that you, Kim Kardashian?) 

Sometimes, a little direction was needed — from a director. Zendaya, smashing in an all-white Louis Vuitton ensemble by gala co-host Pharrell Williams, sported a huge floppy white hat. Getting up from her seat in the cocktail party, she started to put it back on, and Luhrmann, who was chatting with her, helped her find just the right angle. She laughed and went off to chat with Diana Ross.

At every Met Gala, there are newbies — and they're often rather starstruck. One of them was model Christian Latchman, 19, wearing a dramatic white ensemble that combined trousers with a long skirt.

If he looked familiar, that's because Latchman is the face in the photograph on the cover of the exhibit's massive hardcover catalog.

Asked to sum up his feelings about the evening, he said simply: “Astonishment. That's the word for it.”

Also new to the gala was actor Keith Powers, who sat on the sidelines, soaking it in. Was it all intimidating? Overwhelming?

“All of the above,” he said. “It makes me anxious — and happy, and inspired.”

Cocktails are fun, but dinner at the Met Gala sounds even more fun — that's where guests get an A-plus musical performance, for one thing.

But music also accompanies the call to dinner. This time, it was the New York-based High and Mighty Brass Band who did the honors, snaking through cocktails with drums, trombones, a tuba and trumpets.

Then guests headed off — slowly — to dinner, where they feasted on a menu by chef Kwame Onwuachi. Dinner began with papaya piri piri salad, and moved on to creole roasted chicken with a lemon emulsion, and cornbread with honey curry butter and barbecue greens. Dessert? That was a “cosmic brownie” with powdered sugar doughnut mousse.

Even megastars have to play by the rules. Sort of. At the check-in tables, right after the carpet madness, guests were politely asked to hand over their phones, for a piece of tape to be applied to the cameras. Did some remove it later, to snap a few fun shots? Yes, they did.

New York Islanders pro scouting director Ken Morrow knows a thing or two about so-called hockey miracles.

Witnessing the Islanders win the NHL draft lottery on Monday and vault nine other teams in the order for the right to have the No. 1 pick represented yet another memorable moment for the four-time Stanley Cup champion and member of the 1980 gold-medal-winning “Miracle on Ice” U.S. Olympic team.

“I've had a lot of thrills in my hockey life, but this is right up there at the top,” Morrow said. “The hockey gods smiled on us. I can't tell you how thrilled I am for Islanders fans, for our ownership, for the entire Islanders organization.”

The Islanders, who missed the playoffs for the second time in four seasons, are in the midst of a front-office shakeup after not renewing general manager Lou Lamoriello's contract on April 22. And they earned a remarkable lottery win by entering the day with a 3.5% shot — the 10th-best odds — of seeing their numbers come up.

New York wasn't the only team to buck the lottery odds. The Utah Hockey Club won the second round of the lottery, and made the jump from 14th to fourth under the rules limiting teams from moving up no more than 10 spots in the draft order.

“A couple of seconds ago, we were just like 10 back, so it still hasn't sunk in,” Utah GM Bill Armstrong said of a first-year franchise that finished just seven points out of a playoff spot. “This is an exciting moment for us. It's a game-changer for us.”




The San Jose Sharks will pick second after entering the day with the best odds, 18.5%, to win the lottery and a 25.5% chance of landing the No. 1 choice. San Jose, which finished last for a second consecutive year, was seeking to become the NHL's first team to win the lottery and pick first in consecutive years.

“We definitely lucked it out last year to be able to select Mac,” Sharks GM Mike Grier said in referring to selecting Boston University center Macklin Celebrini first overall. “This year would have obviously been nice to have the pick and have the choice of all the players. But picking two, we're still in a pretty good spot so we're happy.”

The Chicago Blackhawks had the second-best chances to win the lottery and will pick third. The remaining 12 teams moved two spots back in the order, starting with Nashville dropping from third to fifth. The final 16 draft spots will be determined following the playoffs.

The Islanders have the right to pick first for the fifth time in team history, and first since selecting John Tavares with the No. 1 choice in 2009.

This year's draft will be held in Los Angeles with the first round taking place on June 27, followed by the final six rounds the next day. Top prospects will convene for the weeklong predraft combine being held in Buffalo next month.

The prospect pool is not considered as deep at the top as last year's class, or next year's group, with Canadian junior forward Gavin McKenna long regarded as the No. 1 candidate.

Erie Otters defenseman Matthew Schaefer is NHL Central Scouting's top-ranked North American prospect followed by OHL Saginaw center Michael Misa and Boston College center James Hagens, the top-ranked U.S. born prospect. Hagens is from Long Island and grew up an Islanders fan.

Listed at 6-foot-2 and 183 pounds, Schaefer maintained his No. 1 position despite missing the final three months of the season after breaking his right collarbone representing Canada at the world junior championships in December.

Schaefer has the potential of becoming only the fifth defenseman selected No. 1 since 2000, and first since Buffalo chose Owen Power in 2021. And he also has the chance of being the first OHL player to go No. 1 since Edmonton drafted Erie's Connor McDavid in 2015.

The top-ranked international skaters are center Anton Frondell and right wing Victor Eklund, who are teammates with Djurgarden of Sweden's second division league.

New York's jump from 10th to first is the biggest involving a team winning the No. 1 selection. And it comes after the last-place team won the lottery to retain the first pick in four of the past five years and 12 times overall since the NHL launched the format in 1995. 

The New York Rangers enjoyed the previous largest move up to No. 1 in 2020, when they were grouped among eight teams — ranked eighth to 15th — with the same odds to win the lottery after being eliminated in the COVID-altered play-in round of the expanded 24-team playoff format.

The lottery was held at the NHL Network studios in New Jersey, and conducted live for the first time in the event's 30-year history. Previously, the lottery was held shortly before the broadcast in front of a limited audience of sequestered observers, followed by the draft selections being revealed in reverse order.

Former advisor for Israel's UN mission Daniel Flesch joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the significance of Israel's plan to take Gaza and how the world is reacting to the proposal as President Donald Trump is expected to visit the Middle East.

A right-wing Israeli minister says victory for Israel won't come until Gaza is ""entirely destroyed"" and Palestinians are forced out into other countries.

Israeli Finance Minister Bazalel Smotrich made the statement during a Tuesday appearance at a conference on Jewish settlements in the West Bank. While Smotrich is a senior Israeli official, his statement does not represent the official policy of the Israeli government.

""Within a year we will be able to declare victory in Gaza,"" he told attendees. ""Gaza will be entirely destroyed, civilians will be sent to... the south to a humanitarian zone without Hamas or terrorism, and from there they will start to leave in great numbers to third countries,"" Smotrich said, according to the Agence France-Presse.

""Israel does not intend to withdraw from territories the IDF captures, not even as part of a deal to release hostages,"" he added.

Smotrich's comments come just a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government approved a plan to take over Gaza and hold it for an undefined period on Monday.

Netanyahu said in a video message the operation would be ""intensive"" and would see more Palestinians moved to southern Gaza ""for their own safety.""

Israeli Cabinet ministers approved the plan Monday morning, but it will only take effect if a hostage deal is not reached by the time President Donald Trump visits Israel on May 13.

Israel currently controls roughly 50% of Gaza, and the plan would see Israeli forces expand into the south. Officials said the plan is set to be implemented gradually, with Israeli forces rooting out Hamas control over territories.

Dubbed Operation Gideon's Chariots, the plan would also seek to prevent the militant Hamas group from distributing humanitarian aid, which Israel says strengthens the group's rule in Gaza. It also accuses Hamas of keeping the aid for itself to bolster its capabilities. The plan also included powerful strikes against Hamas targets, the officials said.

""We want our troops to fight against a tired, hungry, and exhausted enemy, not one that has supplies and aid coming from outside the strip,"" Smotrich said in a statement on Monday.

Ben-Gvir told Fox News Digital that he found gun shops in the U.S. to be ""fascinating.""

Israel's controversial National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir recently visited the U.S., where he met with Jewish groups, law enforcement officials and politicians, as well as facing several clashes with protesters.

The shouting critics, however, did not appear to bother Ben-Gvir, who was a right-wing activist in his youth.

Ben-Gvir spoke with Fox News Digital about his U.S. visit, highlighting his trips to Mar-a-Lago, Yale and New York. He noted that he felt a shift in Israel-U.S. relations since President Donald Trump's return to the White House.

""Under Biden's administration, I was considered persona non grata. Under Trump, I was welcomed at Mar-a-Lago and was able to speak,"" Ben-Gvir told Fox News Digital. He added that having ""an American president who supports us and stands behind us makes a difference"" in wartime.

ISRAELI PRESIDENT SAYS NO PLANS TO EXPEL PALESTINIANS FROM GAZA AFTER MINISTERS' COMMENTS CAUSE UPROAR

Trump was not the only politician who met with the Israeli firebrand. Several high-profile Republicans, including Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., Michael Lawler, R-N.Y., and Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., met with Ben-Gvir on Capitol Hill. 

The House Foreign Affairs Committee, which Mast chairs, posted a photo of the chairman with Ben-Gvir and wrote that the two discussed America and Israel's shared security interests. Mast is well versed in both American and Israeli security needs as a U.S. Army veteran and former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) volunteer.

Prior to his meeting with Mast, Ben-Gvir had the chance to visit his home state where he saw something that he wanted to take back with him to Israel: gun culture.

Ben-Gvir has long been an advocate for wider distribution of firearms in Israel, and while he was visiting the U.S., he took time to see how America handles guns. He had the opportunity to visit both a shooting range and a gun store, which he said was ""fascinating.""

JEWISH YALE STUDENTS SPEAK OUT AFTER ANTISEMITIC PROTEST

""I was surprised by the quantity and types of weapons available. Even I haven't reached that level,"" Ben-Gvir told Fox News Digital.

He spoke about how critics have accused him of arming militias, which he denies. When speaking with Fox News Digital, Ben-Gvir said that the weapons he distributed in Israel ""saved many lives.""

""I believe we need to learn a from the Americans. One of the important lessons is their policy on weapons,"" Ben-Gvir told Fox News Digital. ""I'm not sure I would distribute arms to the same extent, but I definitely believe in expanding access because citizens have the right to defend themselves.""

Gun culture in Israel has changed since the Oct. 7 massacre. Before the attacks, Israel was strict about who was eligible to obtain a firearm. Pre-Oct. 7, firearm licenses were restricted to those who live and work in high-risk areas, licensed tour guides and those who served with Israeli police or IDF security forces, among a few other specified categories, according to an Israeli government website from 2019.

Since Oct. 7, Israel has seen a rise in applications for firearm permits. While Ben-Gvir worked to streamline the handgun application process prior to the attacks, he instituted additional reforms after the massacre. According to the Times of Israel, these reforms included changes to military service requirements for those seeking a license. Additionally, he expanded eligibility requirements to include national service members who have no criminal record, history of violence or mental health issues.

""We need to allow as many citizens as possible to be armed. It gives people a sense of security—when someone has a weapon in their pocket, they feel safer,"" Ben-Gvir told Fox News Digital.He added that he had been fighting to arm communities near Gaza but said people ""didn't listen to me. After Oct. 7, I was proven right. It became clear how necessary it was to provide more weapons to civil defense squads.""

However, he is proud of his work distributing weapons in the area near Gaza and establishing civil defense squads there. ""Thank God, it's working,"" he said.

National Security Advisor Mike Waltz discusses the implications of a judge temporarily halting flights of alleged Tren de Aragua gang members to El Salvador on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's regime does not direct the activities of the Tren de Aragua, according to a newly public memo released by U.S. intelligence agencies last month.

The memo, published Monday by the New York Times, undercuts President Donald Trump's justifications for using the Alien Enemies Act to facilitate deportations. The report represents the ""sense of the community"" of the National Intelligence Council and states they have not found a direct link between Maduro's regime and TdA leadership.

""While Venezuela's permissive environment enables TDA to operate, the Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States,"" the report states.

""The IC bases this judgment on Venezuelan law enforcement actions demonstrating the regime treats TDA as a threat; an uneasy mix of cooperation and confrontation rather than top-down directives [that] characterize the regime's ties to other armed groups; and the decentralized makeup of TDA that would make such a relationship logistically challenging,"" the memo continues.

While the memo cuts against the claim that support for TdA is a direct policy from Maduro's regime, it does note that FBI analysts agree that ""some Venezuelan government officials facilitate TDA members' migration from Venezuela to the United States and use members as proxies … to advance what they see as the Maduro regime's goal of destabilizing governments and undermining public safety in these countries.""

NOEM RIPS DEMOCRATS OVER SUPPORT FOR DEPORTED MIGRANT

The Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows deportation of natives and citizens of an enemy nation without a hearing, has been invoked three times, during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.

Trump's administration declared in March that all Venezuelan citizens 14 years or older who are members of TdA, are within the U.S. and are not naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the U.S. may be apprehended, restrained, secured and removed as ""alien enemies.""

Key to the White House's argument is its claim that TdA operates in conjunction with Cártel de los Soles, the Nicolás Maduro regime-sponsored narco-terrorism enterprise based in Venezuela.

State assemblymember Nancy Muñoz, R-Union, and Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Ky., discuss some citizens delaying and opting out of getting the REAL ID as the deadline approaches. 

It is my second trip to the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles in four days. I admit from the start it is my fault that I had to make two trips. When I traveled two weeks ago, the friendly TSA agents reminded me —repeatedly— that come May 7, I would need to bring my passport as my valid Virginia driver's license was non-compliant with the REAL ID Act.

I was vaguely aware that the push for new ""REAL"" IDs was back, the requirement to obtain one having been suspended during Covid, but unaware that the deadline loomed.

So last Thursday I trekked to my local DMV office, bringing along my current, valid, Virginia driver's license, my current, valid passport, my Social Security Card and my birth certificate. Surely, I supposed, that would be enough as I'd been assured I could fly with just the passport by the helpful Team TSA. 

REAL ID REJECTION BY AMERICANS MAY COME DOWN TO ONE SURPRISING FACTOR

I definitely needed the new license because, while a ""REAL ID is an optional, upgraded version of your driver's license or ID card that has a star in the right corner,"" I had no star and no desire to carry my passport everywhere. 

Not surprisingly, a lot of people want to get their""REAL ID"" for as the VA DMV helpfully alerts you: ""Beginning May 7, 2025, the federal government will require you to present a REAL ID compliant driver's license or ID card, or another federally approved form of ID, in order to board a domestic flight or enter a secure federal facility or military base (some military bases may already require REAL ID or a federally approved form of ID*).""

The DMV opens at 8 AM, so I rolled up last Thursday at 7:30 AM. The line was already more than a dozen people long. An hour later more than 50 good folks were standing in the rope line waiting for one of the three DMV employees assigned to the REAL ID processing. The average processing time was 15 minutes —at the head of the line. You may want to pack a lunch if you get there at official opening time. 

It had not occurred to DMV to perhaps add some staff for REAL ID deadline days, or reassign others from the standard busy work. No. Just three DMVers on Thursday and three again on Monday. 

I'd flunked REAL ID eligibility last week because none of my current documents list my home address. I use a P.O. Box for a variety of reasons on my driver's license and had —wrongfully it turns out— thought that as a passport could get me on the plane, my passport plus my driver's license, birth certificate and Social Security card should serve to secure my star, right?

Wrong. I needed a utility bill or a mortgage statement or a voter registration card with my home address on it. When I smiled my mild protest that, as a valid passport is sufficient to board a plane, why would it not be sufficient to obtain my ""REAL ID"" I got the DMV look back. It's the same look at every DMV everywhere. She had heard it all before, but it says on the VIrginia DMV website that I needed documents with my home address. Hadn't I read the DMV website?

Ms. DMV sent me home in search of ""secondary documents"" with my physical address on it. ""Your house deed will work"" she helpfully offered. 

I dutifully trooped off to my Registrar of Voters and got a voter card with my home address on it. I added a print out of a utility bill and a print out of my mortgage and returned three days later. And held my breath. 

The young'n in front of me was getting shot down and was not happy. He'd taken off work. He'd just moved here. He worked remotely and didn't have a boss who could write him a letter with his home address on it. He hadn't opened a bank account. 

There were unhappy Virginia drivers at windows two and three as well, perplexed that their state government was making it difficult for them to get a new version of their perfectly legal driver's license. 

Expressing dismay at a DMV counter is a rookie mistake. Never, ever express unhappiness or dissatisfaction of any sort with anyone at any DMV. Ever. It will become a mark in your permanent record, and while nothing else moves quickly among the nation's DMVs, word of troublemakers challenge light speed in their travels. My advice is based on experience with four state DMVs and the District of Columbia DMV (the latter is where crying citizens can be seen on an almost on-demand basis.)

So having obtained the paperwork and a promise that the new license would be sent —to my P.O. Box, of course— I decided to search out the original reason for ""Real ID.""

Turns out that ""The REAL ID Act"" was passed in 2005, following recommendations from the 9/11 Commission to set federal standards for state-issued identification. 2005! Now, it's been 20 years since the law passed and almost 24 since 9/11, so the next question is ""Why the urgency now?""

As far as I can tell from the Transportation Security Agency website, the May 7 deadline is now because it is – there had to be a deadline sometime. It's the same reason that octogenarians are routinely pulled aside for special screening because the buzzer sounds at the TSA station. Doesn't matter if you have ""TSA-pre"" or ""Clear"" or have zero luggage and not even a sweater. The buzzer is the virtual guillotine, and there are Madame Defarges everywhere to enforce the buzzer.

Here's the good news. If you entered the country without permission but obtained ""Temporary Protected Status"" under one of the Biden-era machinations, you too can get a ""REAL ID: ""Yes, a TPS beneficiary or individual with a pending TPS application can obtain a REAL ID compliant license or identification card: ""The Secretary of Homeland Security may designate a foreign country for TPS due to conditions in the country that temporarily prevent the country's nationals from returning safely, or in certain circumstances, where the country is unable to handle the return of its nationals adequately. USCIS may grant TPS to eligible nationals of certain designated countries (or parts of countries), who are already in the United States. Eligible individuals without nationality who last habitually resided in the designated country may also be granted TPS."" Such folks are eligible for REAL ID. 

Good to know that. But better to know the passport that will get you on to the plane come Wednesday will not get you a REAL ID. Forewarned is forearmed.

Fox News Digital spoke with TSA Acting Administrator Adam Stahl about how REAL IDs will impact travel with state and airports working ahead of the May 7 deadline.

The countdown is on. In just one day, Americans will no longer be able to travel with a standard driver's license as their ID. Instead, they will need a REAL ID, with a gold star showing in the upper right-hand corner.

Travelers will need to show their REAL ID or other forms of acceptable identification on domestic flights starting Wednesday, May 7.

The deadline has sparked panic among many Americans who have been rushing to obtain the new identification before their travels, with some still waiting to receive their REAL IDs in the mail.

Flyers who enrolled for a REAL ID will receive the identification via mail with the times varying by state.

In California, meanwhile, according to their DMV, ""it typically takes 2 to 4 weeks to receive a physical REAL ID card in the mail after applying.""

In the state of Michigan, the identification should arrive in the mail within two to three weeks, according to its DMV site.

Pennsylvania, for its part, said it will mail out a REAL ID within 15 business days if a person enrolls at a DMV; but if a traveler visits a PennDOT REAL ID Center, the person can ""be verified in real time, and your REAL ID will be issued [the] same day.""

HIDDEN REAL ID HASSLES FACING AIRLINE TRAVELERS AND STATES TO AVOID

Daniel Velez, a spokesperson for TSA New England, shared advice with Fox News Digital about what passengers should do if they're still waiting for their REAL IDs.

""Passengers who present a non-compliant state ID along with a state letter or receipt will still be subject to additional screening but should be able to proceed faster than those who only present a state letter or receipt,"" said Velez.

Travelers experiencing mail delays with their new IDs can use passport alternatives for domestic flights when standard licenses become invalid on Wednesday, said the TSA. (Fox News Digital)

He added, ""We strongly suggest (even if you have a receipt/letter from the DMV) that passengers bring another form of an acceptable ID such as a U.S. passport in order to proceed through security faster.""

Velez said that if passengers do not have any acceptable ID, TSA ""strongly suggest[s] they arrive to the airport 3 hours prior to their departure time.""

""I tried calling, can't reach a person.""

Other forms of identification that will be accepted in lieu of a REAL ID include a valid U.S. passport or passport card; DHS trusted traveler cards such as Global Entry; Department of Defense IDs; permanent resident cards; and border crossing cards. 

REAL ID REJECTION BY AMERICANS MAY COME DOWN TO ONE SURPRISING FACTOR

In the ""r/AskChicago"" forum on Reddit, one person posted a note with the headline, ""What to do if REAL ID is lost in mail.""

The person wrote, ""I went in to get my REAL ID driver's license on April 7, and the tracker on the secretary of state's website says it was mailed out on the 15th, but I still haven't received it. I tried calling, can't reach a person. I tried filling out their online form a few days ago and haven't gotten any sort of response.""

Redditors took to the comments section to share their thoughts on the matter.

""It happened to me once. Waited for over a month and nothing showed up in my mail. Went to secretary of state and applied for another replacement, paid the fee,"" commented a Redditor.

Republicans are gearing up for what is likely to be a brutal battle to select a GOP challenger for Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) next year in one of Democrats' most vulnerable seats.

The decision by Gov. Brian Kemp (R-GA) to bow out of consideration Monday allowed Democrats to take a victory lap, as it dashed Republican hopes stretching from the Peach State to the nation's capital of having a star recruit. The focus quickly turned to other possible GOP challengers, including one that national Republicans behind the scenes particularly want to avoid: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA).

“Obviously, we're disappointed about [Kemp]. He, of course, would have been a great candidate,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) said. “That race is going to be competitive either way, and the good news is there's a lot of interest.”

Thune, prompted if Greene could win a statewide contest amid concerns in the party that her firebrand style of politics could be a liability with swing voters, offered little reassurance of her candidate quality.

“I don't know the answer to that. Obviously, that's up to the people of Georgia,” he said. “But I know there are several in the House delegation over there that are expressing interest and some other statewides too.”

The bench of possible contenders now that Kemp, a popular second-term governor, cleared the way is deep and extends well beyond Greene, the MAGA loyalist who frequently grabs headlines. Other possible hopefuls include Reps. Mike Collins (R-GA), Rick Allen (R-GA), Rich McCormick (R-GA), and Brian Jack (R-GA), Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper, Insurance Commissioner John King, and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.

There was little surprise to Kemp's decision from those familiar with Georgia GOP politics who saw him as having nominal interest in the gig, even as he was lobbied by top Republican senators.

“To Republicans nationally: don't give up on us,” Brian Robinson, a Georgia-based GOP strategist who worked for Kemp's predecessor, former Georgia GOP Gov. Nathan Deal, told the Washington Examiner. “We didn't get Plan A, but Plan B is going to probably be OK. We just need the party primary electorate to act and vote strategically. Who can beat John Ossoff? It's not necessarily going to be the person who gets the party faithful on their feet, acting and hooting and hollering.”

Democrats were quick to label the recruiting blunder an early boost for Ossoff, the first-term, purple-state senator who ousted former GOP Sen. David Perdue in 2020 by just 1.2 percentage points. Ossoff is the only Democrat up for reelection in the Senate whose state Trump won.

Senate Democrats' campaign arm labeled Kemp's decision “yet another embarrassing Republican Senate recruitment failure,” while the Ossoff campaign said the GOP will be forced to “scramble in the aftermath.”

Senate Republicans' campaign arm sought to project optimism that its chances to turn the seat back to red were alive and well. It whacked Ossoff for leaning into rhetoric that President Donald Trump has committed impeachable acts in his second term.

“While Jon Ossoff is running to impeach President Trump, Republicans have a number of strong candidates who can build a winning coalition to add this seat to President Trump's Senate majority,” said Joanna Rodriguez, a spokesperson for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

Kemp is but the latest current or former governor with national name recognition to decline a Senate run in their home state, joining the likes of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) and former New Hampshire GOP Gov. Chris Sununu. Meanwhile, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) is looking to leave Washington with a run for governor as Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) weigh their own possible gubernatorial campaigns.

Recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution polling showed Kemp with the strongest odds among Republicans of unseating Ossoff. Kemp bested Ossoff 49-46% in a hypothetical matchup. Greene, King, and Raffensperger lost by at least 9 points or more. Greene polled the lowest against Ossoff, with 37% to his 54%.

Trump could also sway the race, should he choose to put his thumb on the scale with an endorsement. Greene has a close relationship with him, and Jack is being encouraged by Trump to run, according to a source familiar with the race.

SENATE DEMOCRATS SEE HOPE FOR MIDTERMS WITH 2024 DOWNBALLOT RESULTS

“Whoever it is, the Republicans have got to be strategic,” Robinson said, adding that the GOP can't make the mistakes of 2022 and “put forward a candidate that couldn't win, that wasn't serious.”

Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA) narrowly bested Republican nominee Herschel Walker in a 2022 special election, with many in the GOP pointing to Walker's scandal-ridden campaign as the culprit for failing to retake the seat.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Tina Smith says Hegseth ‘should be fired' over new allegations of Signal use","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/3401954/tina-smith-hegseth-resign-pentagon-signal-use-allegations/","Tue, 06 May 2025 03:09:44 GMT","

Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) called for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to be fired over additional accusations of communications on a nongovernmental messaging service.

A Monday report from the Wall Street Journal alleged that Hegseth used Signal as part of his job much more extensively than previously known, engaging in at least 12 different chats on the unsecured app. Hegseth reportedly used Signal to discuss media appearances, foreign travel, scheduling, and other unclassified but sensitive information.

Smith became one of the first to demand his removal from his position after the accusations.

“He. Should. Be. Fired,” the senator wrote in a post on X.

The Washington Examiner reached out to the Defense Department for confirmation and comment on the report's findings.

He. Should. Be. Fired. https://t.co/HqyZFUHMDm

Though the allegations are new, Smith's call isn't — she has been calling for Hegseth's removal since Signalgate first broke in March.

“Pete Hegseth should follow Pete Hegseth's advice and resign,” she said in a video posted to her Facebook last month, going on to outline the allegations against his usage of the app.

“This is the height of recklessness and irresponsibility, and you don't have to take my word for this,” Smith added, showing an old clip of the then-Fox News host calling on figures who improperly handled information to resign.

HEGSETH ORDERS PURGE OF SENIOR COMMANDERS, CUTTING 20% OF FOUR-STAR GENERALS AND ADMIRALS

Though she announced her retirement from the Senate, with her current term being her last, Smith has sought to go out in a blaze of glory. She has been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration, often using vulgarity to get her point across. In March, she refused to backtrack after calling Elon Musk “a d***” and “billionaire a**‑hole boss.”

“People want to see fight,” she told CNN at the time. “And I think with that tweet that I did, it touched a nerve with millions of people because everybody has had the experience of having some boss who treats them with disrespect, who denigrates their work and is just basically using big power-play moves to … terrorize them.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is not running for the top Democratic spot on the powerful House Oversight Committee, ending speculation she would seek the ranking membership after losing in December.Ocasio-Cortez told reporters she wouldn't try to seek the ranking member position, which is set to be vacant after Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) announced his cancer had returned and he would be stepping away from his leadership position “soon.”Last week, Ocasio-Cortez said there wasn't a “vacancy to run for,” and then told reporters that she was “weighing” a bid. However, on Monday, she announced she would not be seeking the committee's gavel, blaming the caucus's views on seniority as a factor.“It's actually clear to me that the underlying dynamics in the caucus have not shifted with respect to seniority as much as I think would be necessary, and so I believe, I'll be staying put at energy and commerce,” the New York congresswoman said.Had Ocasio-Cortez wanted to run for the position, she would have needed a waiver to return to the committee. She sits on the Energy and Commerce Committee, an “exclusive” panel that, under House rules, muddles her ability to also hold a spot on the Oversight Committee.House Democrats have been facing a generational crisis in the aftermath of the 2024 election, with several younger House members challenging long-term leaders for committee ranking member slots, as many argued it was time for fresh blood in the ranks after Republicans' sweeping victories.Rep. Angie Craig (D-MN) was the only younger member to successfully gain a leadership spot in a contested committee election last December. She is now running for the open Senate seat in Minnesota, but the congresswoman's office told the Washington Examiner she will remain in her role as ranking member on the House Agriculture Committee.Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) serves as Natural Resources Committee ranking member, but his competition, the late Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), withdrew from the race.Ocasio-Cortez passing on a run for the ranking membership does not come as a major shakeup, considering she has been raising significant funds that surpass a typical House member's war chest for reelection in a safe blue seat — amounting to $10 million, a nod that she could be seeking a presidential run or Senate challenge to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).She's also spending considerable time on the road, drawing large crowds during her and Sen. Bernie Sanders's (I-VT) “Fighting Oligarchy” tour in red and blue states.In the interim, Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-MD) will take over Connolly's ranking member duties, and he said in a statement he has the elder congressman's support if Lynch seeks to remain in the position permanently.Other members have been floated for the position, including Reps. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX), Maxwell Frost (D-FL), and Ro Khanna (D-CA).","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Joe Biden used it to help illegal immigrants enter the country. President Donald Trump is using it to help them leave. The contrast between how the two presidents are using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection mobile app couldn't be starker — and it is exactly what the people voted for.

In addition to releasing over 4 million migrants first caught illegally crossing the southern border, Biden admitted an additional 936,500 migrants through the CBP One app. These migrants did not cross the border illegally but instead made appointments using the app to meet with a CBP officer who, after giving them a cursory background check, released them into the country on “humanitarian” parole.

Crucially, migrants admitted through this program did not have to show they qualified for asylum. The background checks administered only checked domestic law enforcement databases. A migrant convicted of rape in Venezuela would not show up on CBP's computers. Only otherwise inadmissible aliens were eligible for the program. In other words, none of the migrants allowed into the country through the program had any right to be here. Biden illegally created his own temporary visa program out of thin air.

In theory, this program was designed to decrease illegal border crossings by rewarding migrants for waiting in line and registering with CBP. But it completely failed. Illegal border crossings steadily rose after the app was introduced in January 2023, before peaking at 300,000 in December of that year. It was not until Mexico agreed to start busing migrants south away from the border that illegal crossings began to fall, and it was not until Trump took office that they virtually disappeared entirely, reaching lows not seen in decades.

Trump of course shut down Biden's CBP One app program on his first day in office. Then on March 10, he unveiled a new version that helps illegal immigrants leave the country. At the start of Trump's use of the app, migrants who signed up and showed they were making progress to self-deportation would be placed on a list that deprioritized them for detention and deportation.

Now the Trump administration has upped the ante. Illegal immigrants who use the new CBP Home app can now book a flight back to their home country paid by the U.S. government. They can also get a $1,000 check from the government once they confirm they are back in their home country.

“If you are here illegally, self-deportation is the best, safest, and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest. DHS is now offering illegal aliens financial travel assistance and a stipend to return to their home country through the CBP Home app,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said when announcing the new program. “This is the safest option for our law enforcement, aliens, and is a 70% savings for U.S. taxpayers.”

According to the Department of Homeland Security, it costs the federal government $17,121 on average to arrest, detain, and remove each illegal immigrant. At $1,000 a pop, plus airfare, self-deportation represents a significant savings to taxpayers per deportation.

In his first four months in office, Trump's DHS has so far deported a little over 100,000 illegal immigrants. If DHS is able to keep up this pace, that means just 400,000 deportations over a full year span and just 1.6 million over a full four-year term. That would leave Trump far short of undoing Biden's illegal immigration legacy.

IMMIGRATION HELPED SHAPE AMERICA, BUT ON HER OWN TERMS

But if Trump is able to boost those numbers by encouraging illegal immigrants to self-deport, everybody wins. Illegal immigrants get to go home $1,000 richer, taxpayers save about $15,000 on each self-deported illegal immigrant, and our communities become safer and less financially burdened with each unvetted migrant who returns home.Whatever legal boundaries Trump is pushing with his Alien Enemies Act deportations, and he is pushing them, the headlines caused by the fight will surely encourage more migrants to fly home before they are shipped to a country they don't want to go to.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

EXCLUSIVE — Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) said he saw a transformed border in the San Diego region during a visit over the weekend, compared to his experience under the Biden administration.

Lankford described to the Washington Examiner a “remarkable” shift in the morale of federal law enforcement tasked with guarding the nation's borders since the Biden administration, during which the United States experienced the greatest number of immigrants arrested on charges of illegally entering the country than any other administration.

SENATE GOP SADDLED WITH SIGNALGATE AS WALTZ PLUCKED TO FILL LAST CABINET POST

“It's pretty, pretty remarkable to see the morale and the attitude of federal law enforcement,” Lankford said during a phone call Monday afternoon. “It was striking, the difference talking to the folks at [Customs and Border Protection] and the folks at Border Patrol about what they're doing.”

“I just can't begin to explain how much of a better place that they are in — the morale, how different it really is,” said Lankford, a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. “They are in such a better spirit.”

Morale had tanked as federal police assigned to the southern border were pulled from the international boundary between 2021 and 2024 to transport and watch over illegal immigrants in custody.

Lankford pointed to three additional changes that he saw during his solo trip to Southern California.

The San Diego region of the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border had the “greatest number” of what the federal government describes as “special interest aliens,” or people deemed suspicious because of their country of origin or terrorism associations.

Former San Diego Border Patrol Chief Aaron Heitke testified in September 2024 that his agents were intercepting immigrants from unusual countries not normally encountered trying to enter the country illegally.

During the first Trump administration, San Diego agents apprehended 10 to 15 special interest aliens per year. That figure exploded to more than 100 in 2022 and higher in 2023, Heitke testified.

Since then, illegal immigrant arrests have declined from more than 33,000 in March 2024 to less than 1,200 in March this year. Facilities that were set up to hold the tens of thousands crossing monthly have since been disbanded, according to Lankford.

First stop in San Diego: meeting with Border Patrol. They've made 45,000 apprehensions from 147 countries, more than anywhere else in the United States. Thank you, @CBP, for being our first line of defense. pic.twitter.com/adxhN07GA5

Because Border Patrol agents who work between the ports of entry are not focused on the influx of illegal immigrants, they have pivoted to focus increasingly on stopping drugs from entering the U.S.

“They're going after drugs moving across the ports of entry,” Lankford said. “They've set up checkpoints again, which had been pulled down. It was just a stark difference. Their focus is really on interdicting drugs because the number of people coming across has dropped so fast. … They're able to get the time to be able to detect it, find and chase down the leads, and to be able to go get after the narcotics.”

Border Patrol agents told Lankford that they have seen an uptick in maritime human smuggling, given that agents on land are on duty and ready to respond to attempted crossings.

“They're receiving more attempts for smuggling coming in through the ocean, people trying to swim around the barrier, which they've got that well-placed,” Lankford said. “They just turn people around immediately. It's folks that are jumping on jet skis and then taking jet skis up as fast as they can around the barrier to be able to come in.”

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION NOW PAYING $1,000 TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO SELF-DEPORT

Other people are in small boats that speed north along the coastline and attempt to drop off immigrants miles north of the border. The Coast Guard, which is responsible for guarding the coastline further out to sea, has also increased, he said.“It's also life-saving,” Lankford said. “They've had multiple times, these boats are not of the highest quality. It's very dangerous how they operate them, and they've had times where they … flipped over and dumped everyone out into the water, no life jackets.”

In an era of intense constitutional combat, Congress is nowhere to be found.

Everyone who follows American politics is going to spend a lot of time thinking about presidential and judicial power over the next few years. But to really understand the coming clashes between the president and the courts, and the constitutional environment in which they're taking place, we have to pay attention to what isn't happening in our system of government almost as much as to what is.

Congress is not doing its job, and the vacuum that its dereliction has created is encouraging presidential and judicial overreach. Congress's weakness is our deepest constitutional problem, because it is not a function of one man's whims and won't pass with one administration's term. It is an institutional dynamic that has disordered our politics for a generation. It results from choices that members of Congress have made, and only those members can improve the situation. It is hard to imagine any meaningful constitutional renewal in America unless they do.

A weak Congress is not the norm in the American system, and a Congress this weak would surely have surprised the authors of the Constitution. They were far more concerned about excessive congressional strength, worrying it might muscle out the executive and the judiciary. “In republican government, the legislative authority necessarily predominates,” James Madison wrote. Looking around at the 13 state governments in the late 18th century, he observed that “the legislative department is everywhere extending the sphere of its activity, and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.”

Yuval Levin: What is wrong with congress (and how to fix it)

The growth of American government and the complexity of modern life gradually empowered our presidents and the tangle of administrative agencies that surrounds them. But that did not mean that Congress had to fade into the background. Into the late 20th century, the national legislature aggressively asserted itself, extending its oversight powers over a growing administrative state and battling presidents for preeminence. When the courts got drawn into constitutional battles, they tended to revolve around personal rights and the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment, while struggles over the structural Constitution and the separation of powers were generally wars between Congress and the president. Even in the late 1980s, scholars of our system could warn of an imperial Congress and a fettered presidency. And in 1995, Republicans under Newt Gingrich were determined to use their new congressional majorities to keep the president constrained.

The reasons for the subsequent decline in Congress's stature and assertiveness are complex, but some of the very measures Gingrich took to consolidate power on Capitol Hill contributed to the trends we are witnessing now. Gingrich advanced an almost-parliamentary model of the House of Representatives. He empowered the speaker and majority leader at the expense of the policy-focused committees, and set in motion a process that robbed most members of the opportunity for meaningful legislative work. His moves dramatically accelerated what was by then a 20-year trend toward the centralization of authority in the hands of congressional leaders. House leaders of both parties have pushed further in that direction in this century, and the Senate has largely followed suit. These efforts were intended to make Congress more effective, but in practice, they rendered most legislators almost irrelevant.

As a result, many ambitious members of Congress have concluded that their path to prominence must run not through policy expertise and bargaining in committees but through political performance art on social media and punditry on cable news. Our broader political culture has pushed in the same direction, encouraging performative partisanship. And the narrowing of congressional majorities has put a premium on party loyalty, further empowering leaders, and leaving many members wary of the cross-partisan bargaining that is the essence of legislative work.

Because it has become less capable of functioning as a venue for legislative negotiation, a centralized, party-disciplined Congress has naturally come to understand itself as ancillary to the presidency. These days, when Congress is in the hands of the president's party (as it has been at the beginning of every new presidency since Bill Clinton's three decades ago), it tends to recede into the background, sometimes working to pass the president's agenda but mostly serving as a venue for commentary on his performance. When it is not in the hands of the president's party, Congress becomes a focal point for opposition, but still not for legislation.

In his first 100 days, Donald Trump signed only five bills into law—fewer than any other modern president. In a period rife with constitutional conflict in Washington, the first branch has done essentially nothing.

This willful passivity renders the rest of what happens in our government largely symbolic. The president can't actually advance much durable, substantive policy change in the absence of congressional action. The ostentatious parades of executive orders that now mark the beginning of every new presidency are just attempts to cover up that frustrating reality. As Republican deficit hawks have learned in recent months, DOGE can only talk about spending cuts: If Congress doesn't act, the budget doesn't change.

The same is true of regulatory reform. President Trump is testing the boundaries of his power to rein in the independent agencies that Republicans have complained about for years, but it is far from clear if much of what he is doing will endure. Congress could achieve such change well within the boundaries of its undisputed powers. It just hasn't moved to do it. The judiciary has been trying to press this point for years. The Supreme Court's administrative-law decisions over the past half decade have all sought to create space for Congress to reassert itself against regulatory agencies. But all the Court can do is create opportunities for such reassertion; it can't make Congress act.

Read: Why isn't congress doing anything?

The policy terrain of the Trump era is also rife with opportunities for legislative action, if only Congress would seize them. Trump has made tariffs an organizing principle of his economic policies, for instance, and in ways that many congressional Republicans disapprove of. Tariff policy plainly belongs to Congress—the Constitution could not be clearer about that. Legislators have delegated broad emergency powers to the president to set tariff rates, but could withdraw that delegation, or refashion it as they choose, anytime they want. If members are unhappy about Trump's tariffs (as large majorities in both houses appear to be), they can do something about them, but Republican leaders have chosen not to. House Republicans even changed the rules of their chamber so that they couldn't vote on a repeal of Trump's tariff authorities—robbing themselves of power rather than using it.

Some of the president's advisers are eager to push Congress even further aside in the coming years and insist on the executive's power to “impound” federal money—that is, to decline to spend funds appropriated by Congress that the president would rather not spend. This is an affront to the legislature's most fundamental power. The administration is basically challenging Congress to a duel that the legislative branch cannot decline without surrendering its honor.

But surrendering its honor, and its power and ambition, is precisely what Congress has been doing for two decades. As long as Congress won't do its job, the other branches will keep overreaching—making it harder for them to do their proper jobs as well, and leaving the country's most significant challenges unresolved.

Our Constitution created a republican form of government, and Madison was right to insist that, in such a government, the legislative power necessarily predominates. As long as Congress declines to at least try to predominate, though, our system will not work as intended.

And Congress has only itself to blame. It has grown weak because its weakness is what its members want. There is no shortage of ideas for how to fix what now ails the institution. But all of them share one flaw: They will succeed only if legislators choose to pursue them. Congress cannot regain its strength until its members want it to.

So for all that we will rightly worry about presidential power in the next few years, we cannot break out of our constitutional bind without looking down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol. Anyone contemplating where to seek change or how to direct reformist energies should take notice of a counterintuitive yet inescapable fact: Addressing the overreach of the judicial or executive branches requires first changing what members of Congress want.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

If there's one cue Trump missed from the Russian dictator, it's never to mess with economic stability.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

When Vladimir Putin came to power in Russia in 2000, his legitimacy was paper-thin. The country had defaulted on its debt two years earlier. Pensioners were protesting in the streets. Putin's predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, had become a walking punch line.​​ Russia was still reeling from the humiliation of losing the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union.

Putin rode into the Kremlin partly on a promise that he would restore the country's standing in the world. But he understood from the start that to consolidate power, he'd have to offer Russians something more than a vision of greatness. The circus—military parades, shirtless equestrianism, singing “Blueberry Hill”—would come later. First, Putin had to take care of bread.

Today, many commentators compare President Donald Trump's second term to Putin's rise to czardom in Russia. Certainly, Trump has adopted many of the same measures Putin and other autocrats did to secure control; he's ginned up animus against domestic enemies (migrants and liberal elites) and foreign ones (the countless nations “ripping us off”) while transforming the Department of Homeland Security into an enforcement apparatus that is seemingly impervious to federal laws.

But for someone taking so many cues from the Russian dictator, Trump is missing a crucial element that made Putin's consolidation of power successful: economic stability. Trump seems to assume that cultural grievance, partisan backing, and his innate talent for dominating the news cycle will matter more than quiet economic competence and tangible results. But within the first 100 days of his second term, 53 percent of Americans said that the economy had gotten worse since Trump took office, and 41 percent said that their own finances have taken a hit.

Read: Autocracy crushed my alma mater. Then I got to Columbia.

A senior Kremlin official once told me that Stalin's No. 1 problem was his inability to delegate. Putin did not share this weakness. He saw how Yeltsin's presidency had collapsed under the weight of economic chaos and repeated financial crises, and that if he wanted his own regime to survive, he would have to delegate monetary and fiscal policy to competent people, rather than making it an extension of his ideological project.



Months before he became president, Putin tasked his longtime associate Herman Gref—then first deputy minister of state property—with drafting a sweeping pro-market reform plan. Gref was one of several officials appointed to the top tier of government who didn't come from Putin's KGB days, or even share the president's vision of a neo-imperial Russia. They were technocrats, and their effect on the regime—and its stability—was just as important as that of the Kremlin's propaganda and security apparatus. Maybe even more so.

“Economic performance was key for Putin's popularity, just as underperformance was key for Yeltsin's lack of support,” Sergei Guriev, the dean of London Business School and the former chief economist of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, told me. He noted that Putin was lucky in his timing: When he took office, oil prices were relatively high, and the economy under Yeltsin had reached a low point.

Gref delivered a 10-year road map that included tax cuts, deregulation, land reform, and pension restructuring. Putin implemented many of these proposals within his first three years in office. Not all of them—only about a third of the plan was ultimately realized—but the reforms that did go through made a significant impact. They sparked investment in agriculture, encouraged small businesses to leave the gray market, and improved the entrepreneurial climate. Macroeconomic stability, bolstered by booming oil prices, helped Russia repay much of its debt and build up financial reserves. When Putin came to power, Russian GDP per capita was less than $1,400; by the end of his second term, it had increased ninefold, reaching $12,500.

The Kremlin wrapped its economic policies in confident, populist messaging. At the core of Putin's narrative was the promise to restore stability and dignity after the chaos of the 1990s. State media drove the point home: Under Putin, wages and pensions were paid on time, economic collapse had been averted, and ordinary Russians were finally seeing tangible improvements. He was cast as the guarantor of both order and welfare.

The regime leaned heavily into what analysts call the “myth of authoritarian competence.” And although the “order” part was often undercut by terrorist attacks and unrest in the Caucasus, the “welfare” message stuck; the numbers, at least for a time, were solid.



The 2008 financial crisis became the first big test of Putin's economic policy and the propaganda that serviced it. Oil prices crashed, and Russia entered a serious recession. The country invaded Georgia in 2008, giving Putin's already high approval ratings an eight-point boost to 88 percent; but the nationalist surge risked wearing off because the government was not responding to the economic downturn. The Kremlin finally rolled out an anti-crisis plan in March 2009—and its propaganda went into overdrive.

I was in Moscow at the time, working as a producer for Russian television. A Kremlin-approved talking point for a 2009 show I worked on read as follows: “The government wasn't caught off guard by this crisis. In fact, it could be a turning point, as our country finally has the chance to claim its rightful place among the world's economic superpowers.” We framed the crisis as an opportunity.

Putin addressed the public, insisting that the people were the priority—stable pensions, salaries for the workers, and their ability to weather the storm. He held carefully scripted, televised meetings with oligarchs and officials, presenting himself as a leader who felt the people's pain and shared their frustration. Our messaging wasn't meant to rally the base against the opposition or even the West. It was meant to reassure the entire nation: Putin's “anti-crisis plan should unite all political parties around a single goal,” I wrote, “to protect the quality of life for all Russians—regardless of what happens in the world's financial markets.”

Andrew Ryvkin: That time I was a Russian propagandist

Our narrative mattered, but it was not determinative. In their book The Popularity of Authoritarian Leaders, Guriev and Daniel Treisman note that citizens' direct experience of changing wages, prices, and employment levels limits the power of censorship and propaganda. The Kremlin's ability to credibly exaggerate Putin's compassion and the government's competence, or to shift blame to oligarchs and faceless bureaucrats—the Russian “deep state”—had limits. What would ultimately restore public confidence were the facts: One of Russia's technocrats, the Western-leaning finance minister Alexei Kudrin, had steered the country through years of fiscal conservatism, which had stocked Russia's sovereign wealth funds with enough petrodollars to buffer the 2008 crash.

Trump, in contrast to Putin, seems to have delegated neither economic management nor communications to specialists. The most powerful man in the world still answers his own phone, writes his own “truths,” and spins his own economic policy. The latter is framed as nothing short of a war: “Our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, and plundered,” Trump declared. “Foreign leaders have stolen our jobs, foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once-beautiful American Dream.” Faced with adverse results to his policies—inflation ticking up, consumer sentiment dropping, markets reacting poorly—Trump has been dismissive. He has said that tariffs are “like medicine. They might sting a little, but they cure the disease.” Then he told reporters,“Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30”—invoking children's discomfort, a rhetorical move most leaders instinctively avoid. “So maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally.”

Those tasked with spreading, or at least softening, Trump's message are forced to parrot the president or risk his ire. But public statements seemingly designed to satisfy one man's ever-changing narrative fail to reassure markets, voters, or institutions. In a span as short as 48 hours, the president and administration officials will give multiple, often contradictory statements on economic policy, leading markets to crash or surge.

The administration ultimately loses control of the narrative as a result. Headlines about retaliatory tariffs, bond-market turmoil, and looming price hikes threaten to crowd out the Trump team's more popular messages on rooting out undocumented migrants and DEI. Jobs surged in March, and GDP grew by 2.4 percent in the last quarter of 2024—but this good news was buried beneath Trump's chaotic tariff messaging. Trump repeatedly postponed the tariffs, leading even Fox News to question whether he had capitulated. The president's approval ratings slid, so he attacked the polls. The economy contracted last month, and Trump deflected: “That's Biden, not Trump.”

Russian technocrats were bad public speakers. They could never improvise colorful one-liners, such as Howard Lutnick's assertion that the Europeans “hate our beef because our beef is beautiful and theirs is weak,” but that was precisely the point. They were not there to mouth Putin's talking points—they were there to reassure. If a Russian billionaire had gone on air declaring that the country's “great” economy “is the winner here” while standing in front of a screen flashing huge market losses, those responsible would have lost their jobs.



In 2011, street protests erupted across Russia, challenging Putin's rule. Consolidating his personal power became Putin's overriding imperative. Had he been more interested in economic growth, he might have adopted reforms—privatization, deregulation, an independent judiciary, and prosecuting corruption, including among his own inner circle. But Putin was not prepared to empower independent actors who might weaken his grip.

Unable to reform without undermining a political model built on centralization, loyalty, and corruption, Putin abandoned the promise of shared prosperity. The Russian economy never regained the momentum of his first decade in power: By 2019, GDP had grown just 2 percent above its 2008 level.

Putin turned instead to foreign conquest—Crimea, then Donbas, then the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But he still took economic stability seriously, as something more than a messaging problem. When the first wave of Western sanctions hit in 2014, Elvira Nabiullina, the respected head of the Russian Central Bank, aggressively raised interest rates and allowed the ruble to float, meaning that the market would determine its value. Most Russians see the dollar-ruble exchange rate as the key indicator of economic stability, so this was a punishing strategy. Many in Parliament called for Nabiullina's resignation, with one member from the ruling United Russia party calling the Central Bank an “enemy of the nation,” adding that it was bent on doing “evil.”

Nabiullina spoke in Parliament and made a 12-minute appearance on prime-time news. She didn't invoke any of the usual propagandist clichés—Crimea, the Russian world, the evil West—but spoke instead like an economics professor, lecturing on currency speculation and the Central Bank's rationale for letting the ruble float. Putin, notably, refrained from either criticizing or praising her, saying only, “You can go after Nabiullina, but don't forget that overall,” the Central Bank's “policy is reasonable.”

Inflation was tamed. The ruble stabilized. And despite heavy sanctions, Russia weathered the storm without a full-scale financial meltdown. For these measures, Nabiullina was named Central Bank Governor of the Year by Euromoney magazine. The Kremlin, notably, avoided selling the public easy promises or denials during the period of economic pain, betting that monetary discipline would do more than a propaganda campaign to preserve long-term regime stability.

Garry Kasparov: The Putinization of America

Following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia became the most heavily sanctioned country on Earth. The Kremlin redoubled its repression and curbed nearly all forms of free speech, pushing many Russians to emigrate. Yet it has also mounted an enormous effort to stabilize its consumer economy through parallel import—the practice of importing goods without the permission of the original manufacturer. The government has made sure that Coca-Cola is still available, people can buy new cars, and Boeing and Airbus jets—banned from being serviced in the West—still fly. The fact that life in Russia has remained “normal” for consumers has become an implicit propaganda feat in itself.

Contrary to what many in the Russian opposition movement say, today's Russia isn't run on repression and propaganda alone. At its core, Putin's relationship with the Russian people is still a transactional one. In wartime Russia, welders in military factories are reportedly earning more than $40,000 a year—four times the national median. Men are paid up to $36,000 for signing up to fight in Ukraine; if they're killed, their families can get up to $150,000 in compensation. On a typical recruitment poster, the promised salary takes up twice as much space as the national flag or military slogans.

“The fact that there are massive payouts suggests that even after 2022, Putin has not been able to construct a convincing ideology,” Sergei Guriev, at London Business School, told me. Money—not greatness—may be selling young Russians on Putin's war.

Trump, in contrast, seems to be banking on cultural affinity and his own charisma. One hundred days into his presidency, his message on the economy isn't We'll protect your pensions, your wages, your savings. It's Only the weak will fail.

Any authoritarianism is dangerous for the people. But one without even an illusion of economic stability can be dangerous for the authoritarian himself. Maybe Putin, in one of his long conversations with Trump, can tell him: The circus is vital, but you should never take away the bread.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The next big cicada eruption is upon us.

by  Benji Jones

Oh, to be a cicada. 

For the last 17 years, a group of cicadas known as Brood XIV has been buried several inches underground, doing very little. This particular batch of insects has missed a global pandemic, Donald Trump winning two presidential elections, Brexit, multiple wars, and more. 

Now they're about to emerge. 

By the billions.

Across large portions of the eastern US, from Long Island to central Tennessee. 

Around May and June, the noisy insects will erupt from the ground and live only for a few weeks — just long enough to find mates and lay eggs — before dying. Once their offspring hatch, the young will bury themselves underground, remaining largely oblivious to the world for another 17 years.

The map above, which shows Brood XIV in neon green, provides only a rough approximation of where different broods will appear. For a more granular map, check out this one the University of Connecticut provided. This year's brood is similarly shown in neon green on that map.

Eastern North America is the only place in the world where you find periodical cicadas — groups of cicadas that emerge from the ground every 13 or 17 years, depending on the brood, or group. Slightly different kinds of cicadas, known as annual cicadas, appear every summer and have a global distribution. (How do cicadas count years? Likely using the flow of tree sap, as I explain here.)

Brood XIV is the second largest brood of cyclical cicadas and surfaces every 17 years.

While brief, the coming insect explosion will shape ecosystems for years to come. These pulses of bugs provide food for pretty much everything in the forest and have been shown to increase bird populations and shift the hunting patterns of other species. As one study put it, pulses of periodical cicadas can “rewire” entire forest food webs.

If you come across what you think is a Brood XIV periodical cicada, report it! You can download an app called Cicada Safari to submit your photos. It'll help the researchers who study them.

To defend democracy, the courts must rule in favor of a lawmaker who bullied a high school student.

by  Ian Millhiser

The Supreme Court has been asked to decide a case that combines two of the most charged issues in the US at the moment: trans participation in sports, and attacks on voting rights.

The case's inciting incident came in February, when Laurel Libby, a Republican elected to the Maine House of Representatives, wrote a Facebook post criticizing a transgender athlete who won a statewide pole vaulting championship. In that post, Libby did not blur or otherwise obscure the high school student's face, and she named the student and her school.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

In response, Maine House Speaker Ryan Fecteau, a Democrat, asked Libby to remove the post due to concerns “that publicizing the student's identity would threaten the student's health and safety.” When Libby refused, a majority of the state house passed a resolution censuring Libby — that resolution reiterated Fecteau's concern that shining such a spotlight on a high school student “may endanger the minor.” It also highlighted a study showing that “transgender people are over four times more likely to be victims of violence.”

Thus far, all of this is fine as a constitutional matter. While Libby has a First Amendment right to speak out against trans rights, government entities like the Maine House also have a right to express their own viewpoints on controversial issues. And that includes formally denouncing statements by individual lawmakers that a majority of the legislature finds repugnant.

But Maine's House rules also provide that Libby “may not be allowed to vote or speak” on the House floor until she apologizes for the conduct that resulted in her censure. She refused to do so, and thus has effectively been stripped of her ability to vote on legislation since last winter. This also means that her constituents are effectively stripped of their representation in the state house, because their duly elected representative cannot vote on bills.

That is not allowed. Indeed, The Supreme Court's decision in Bond v. Floyd (1966), which involved the Georgia House of Representatives' decision not to seat a duly elected lawmaker — ostensibly because he spoke out against the Vietnam War — is almost directly on point. Bond held that the First Amendment “requires that legislators be given the widest latitude to express their views on issues of policy.” The same rule should apply in Libby v. Fecteau, which is now pending before the Supreme Court.

One of the most well-established principles under the First Amendment is that offensive speech must be protected. Because the First Amendment protects against government censorship, virtually all free speech cases involve speech that is sufficiently offensive to government officials that they decided to sanction it. If the freedom of speech did not apply to speech that many Americans find repulsive, it would be worthless.

Even if the First Amendment does not apply to speech that is somewhat menacing to a minor — itself a dubious proposition — stripping Libby of her voting rights does more than simply strike at her right to free speech. It punishes her constituents by stripping them of their right to representation. Indeed, the Maine legislature's actions would be less offensive to the Constitution if it had simply expelled Libby from the state house altogether. At least in that circumstance, the people of her district could elect someone else to cast votes on their behalf.

Libby's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to weigh in on this case by Tuesday, when the Maine House convenes for a floor session. That won't happen, as Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who oversees emergency requests to her Court that arise out of Maine's federal courts, set a May 8 deadline for the state legislature to respond to Libby's arguments.

There are legitimate reasons why the Court might not weigh in on the Libby case anytime soon. The case arises on the Court's “shadow docket,” a mix of emergency motions and other expedited matters that the justices used to be very cautious about deciding prematurely before President Donald Trump's first term. Some of the justices remain concerned about overuse of the shadow docket, and may wish to give an appeals court more time to consider the case.

But some court needs to intervene. Regardless of what anyone thinks about Libby's attack on a high school student, allowing lawmakers to strip their colleagues of their ability to vote on legislation would set an alarming precedent that could easily be used by authoritarian legislators to stifle dissent.

For now, no court has weighed in on whether it is constitutional to strip Libby of her ability to vote or to speak on the House floor. A federal district judge denied relief to Libby on the grounds that the legislature's decision to sanction her is protected by “legislative immunity.” An appeals court issued a brief decision denying Libby an emergency order immediately reinstating her voting rights, but the case remains pending before that court.

The principle of legislative immunity is well-established. As the Court said in Powell v. McCormack (1969), it is intended to ensure that “legislators are free to represent the interests of their constituents without fear that they will be later called to task in the courts for that representation.”

Imagine, for example, that the Maine legislature enacts a tax on the sale of beets. If this tax is illegal, a beetroot farmer might file a lawsuit against the state's taxing agency seeking to be reimbursed for paying it. But they cannot sue the state lawmakers who voted for the tax. Those lawmakers are shielded from liability, and the farmer's suit lies against the state officials who actually collect the tax.

While this framework protects lawmakers from being hauled off into court, it is not intended to render illegal legislation — or, in the Libby case, an illegal sanction imposed on a lawmaker — entirely immune from judicial review. 

In the Powell case, for example, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a duly-elected member of Congress that the US House refused to seat, in large part because of corruption allegations against that lawmaker. Though legislative immunity might have prevented that unseated lawmaker, New York's Rep. Adam Clayton Powell, from suing the actual members of Congress who voted to unseat him, the Court allowed his suit to proceed against the House Sergeant at Arms — who was responsible for paying House members.

“Although an action against a Congressman may be barred” by the Constitution, Powell concluded, “legislative employees who participated in the unconstitutional activity are responsible for their acts.”

A similar rule should apply in Libby. Though Libby's suit against Fecteau should be precluded by legislative immunity, she also sued Robert Hunt, the clerk of the Maine House who is responsible for tallying votes cast by representatives. She seeks an injunction requiring Hunt to count her votes.

The district judge, for what it is worth, claimed that Bond and Powell do not apply to the Libby case because, in both of those cases, a lawmaker was removed from a legislature entirely, while Libby was merely sanctioned until she apologizes. But this distinction should not matter. Powell established that “legislative employees” like Hunt can be sued for “unconstitutional activity” generally, regardless of whether that activity results in someone being removed from their job as a lawmaker.

Moreover, it's not hard to imagine how lawmakers could abuse the power to strip away a colleague's voting rights. The Bond case, for example, involved state Rep. Julian Bond, a prominent Black civil rights activist who was elected to the Georgia House shortly before the Voting Rights Act of 1965 enfranchised Black voters in the Jim Crow South. Though his colleagues claimed that they refused to seat him because of his views on the Vietnam War, Bond's race almost certainly drove many of his unreconstructed colleagues to lock him out of office.

The Maine House's decision to strip Libby of her voting rights is also evocative of a more recent incident, where Tennessee's Republican-controlled House voted to expel two Black Democratic lawmakers under circumstances which strongly suggested that their race motivated this expulsion. (The legislature backed down after both lawmakers were reelected.)

Libby, who was sanctioned for bullying a teenager, hardly occupies the same moral high ground as Julian Bond. But the same constitutional principles that applied in Bond should apply in Libby. Otherwise, any lawmaker who is in the minority within their legislative body could be targeted by colleagues who want to silence them and to disenfranchise their constituents.

Don't blame Joe Rogan too much — one theory says that the roots of this gender gap go back decades.

by  Maia Mindel

The emergence of a political divide between young men and young women has been one of the most-discussed developments in recent politics. President Donald Trump won 56 percent of men under 30 in November, compared to just 41 percent four years earlier. It's not just the US, either. Around the globe, young men are more likely to support right-wing parties and politicians than their female counterparts. South Korean men and women, for example, are some of the furthest apart in the world: Voters under 30 had a gender gap of 25 percentage points in support for deposed President Yoon Suk Yeol.

The causes of this divide are complex and have been endlessly discussed. There's social media and the existence of “manosphere” content creators like Andrew Tate and Joe Rogan, who promote right-wing parties and ideas. Additionally, widespread isolation, especially for the youth, means that social media now has an outsized impact, leading to a distorted public sphere where preferences are distorted by biased algorithms. There is, of course, a gendered backlash aspect: Women have made notable advances in the public sphere over the last five years, and Trump has capitalized on anxieties about such gains, as well as longer-simmering grievances and tensions, to advance his reactionary agenda. 

But while much of the debate has centered on electoral strategy, social issues like transgender rights or Me Too, and chastising activists for their unproductive work, the truth is somewhat more nuanced. Younger men are more conservative on some issues, but men's and women's differing votes don't seem to be based on policy differences: Surveys of American voters point to men and women largely agreeing on which issues they find most important, and they mostly seem to trust the same parties on each of those issues.

The best way to understand the growing gender divide isn't the culture war. It's how the economy has shifted over the past half-century.

To understand the divergence in values between men and women, one has to understand where fundamental values — such as the support for democracy as opposed to far-right parties — come from. At their core, these develop not from heady cost-benefit analysis of policy, but from prior experiences, particularly during formative years (the “14 to 24” decade). 

Let's start with the most fundamental experience: economic security. Support for democracy relies on democracies providing material benefits. And so, economic inequality and lack of economic growth — which have been accelerating in recent decades — are both associated with widespread turns to the radical, anti-democratic, misogynistic right. 

In the United States and Europe, for example, rising wealth inequality and slowing economic growth are linked to support for far-right parties. In Brazil, unemployment increased attendance at conservative evangelical churches that then boosted the support of far-right candidates. The clearest examples come from Nazi Germany: areas more closely harmed by Weimar Era austerity programs saw the largest upswells of support for Adolf Hitler. 

A second crucial factor in support for democracy is “social trust” — that is, trust in the government, institutions, and other citizens. Once again, economics plays a role. Economic deprivation and income inequality are linked to lower social trust. Voters in worse economic conditions are consistently more likely to endorse a zero-sum mindset, or the belief that the only way for a person to gain from society is at the expense of others. A zero-sum mentality results in less support for progressive, anti-individualistic, or cosmopolitan values, while non-zero-sum values and high social trust seem to be linked with more liberal values. 

Studies consistently find that job insecurity leads to sexist views (for example, among European men), as well as developing beliefs that women's advancement came at their expense. Chinese men who experience worse economic conditions are also more hostile to women and more sexist, and British men who grew up in high-unemployment regions report feeling less agreement with progressive and feminist statements. 

But shouldn't broad economic conditions — and their associated effect on trust and political values — equally affect men and women, driving both rightward? No. 

Starting in the 1970s, but especially in the 1990s, most developed and middle-income economies transformed; in particular, manufacturing declined and service jobs increased due to trade, lower unionization, and automation. 

In consequence, the labor market split into two: lower-paying “manual” occupations (which include both construction and, say, childcare) and higher-paying “cognitive” jobs. One classic example is ATMs: They eliminated the highly paid, low-education job of “bank teller,” and replaced it with low-paying customer service jobs (the people at the bank counter), and higher-paying “financial services” jobs (the people offering loans, advice, or other bank services). The Great Recession further entrenched this split: The “cognitive” track added 8.4 million jobs (on net) after 2007, while the manual job track lost, on net, 5.5 million. 

Since manufacturing was traditionally a “male” job, its decline in the economy meant that men had worse job prospects and fewer opportunities, especially since the skills required in manufacturing itself also changed to require more education. As a result, men without college degrees lost their position as the second-highest earning group of people (after college-educated men). And cuts to social services disproportionately affected men due to their higher likelihood of committing crimes.

At the same time, the decline of manufacturing made men less marriageable (and therefore lowered fertility rates), a dynamic that's made the situation worse since securing a wife and starting a family was a major motivation for men to work. The other major sector that employs “unskilled” men, construction, suffered devastating setbacks after the Great Recession and didn't recover afterward. Men are also at a disadvantage in the “care economy” section of the manual sector, somewhat due to (self-imposed) cultural factors: They just don't want to apply to “pink collar” sectors. 

In contrast, the growth in the cognitive sector has benefited women. Men have been falling behind women in high school performance, college enrollment, and college graduation, putting them at a disadvantage in securing high-paying cognitive jobs. The reasons are complex, but they may be related to neurological differences (though this idea has come under criticism). Research suggests that male teachers teach boys more effectively than female ones. This trend was worsened by Covid, which increased achievement gaps in students and, like many other extreme events, reduced medium-term educational attainment. 

And after entering the knowledge sector job market, women still retain an advantage. First, women have better “social” skills than men, and these are in greater demand in the cognitive sector. Flexible work arrangements, which have become more common in recent years, have benefited women, who favor flexibility more. And while men do benefit over their female coworkers due to fast-tracked promotions and relationships with (overwhelmingly male) superiors, the reluctance of boomer bosses to retire crowds out younger men from top jobs. 

This dynamic has been especially important for men's beliefs on gender issues (since men become more supportive of traditional gender roles) and have also boosted far-right and anti-cosmopolitan viewpoints for them specifically. One such example is the online vitriol against the “Gen Z boss and a mini” video, where female employees of an Australian company sing and dance about their workplace. It has even been cited by the online, mostly male, right as a reason to support tariffs. 

When manufacturing left center stage, male workers struggled to adapt — resulting in, as social scientists consistently find, lower social trust, zero-sum mindsets, and more regressive gender norms. All of this provided timber for the far-right explosion even before factoring in the manosphere and algorithms. 

Sociologist Zygmunt Bauman explains in his book Liquid Modernity that, in the shift from the manufacturing economy to the cognitive economy, men lost their social role as producers and providers, while women shifted away from being caretakers, and both became consumers. 

However, Bauman missed that traditional gender norms make taking an identity as “consumers” less attractive to men since men, perhaps influenced by psychological differences in attitudes around money, tend to spend less than women on “frivolous” items such as clothing or entertainment. Feminist messages, such as those seen in books like Lean In and the “girlboss” trope, empowered women to take pride in their role as employees and in business. Likewise, traditional roles as caretakers have not actually been rejected to a large extent, leaving women with many avenues to personal satisfaction while also abandoning men “in crisis.” 

The crisis of masculinity is an opportunity to redefine men's role in an inclusive way of both caretaking and producing. This is especially crucial given how it is unlikely that manufacturing will make a resurgence as a dominant part of the economy. 

While this means that direct attempts to raise social trust by putting men in crisis on the factory line seem unfeasible, a surprising silver lining comes from the fact that most young men are not virulent misogynists: sexist views among boys are less common than those same boys think, and this lack of openness keeps them from expressing their real beliefs. One extreme example is that, in Saudi Arabia, husbands are supportive of women working, but refuse to express this belief due to fear of judgment by other men, while their wives want to work, but think these attitudes are not common among women. 

So it is possible to break out of the “sexism trap” by encouraging people to express their true views, by encouraging people to make cross-gender friendships and have in-depth conversations, and by building a more prosperous and functional government and economy — since positive experiences with democracy and market-based economies raise support for them and strengthen social trust. If a world of loneliness and economic deprivation can produce these anti-democratic values, a world of social connection and prosperity will surely replace them.

Trump's latest executive order presents a test for Democrats.

by  Nicole Narea

President Donald Trump is again targeting a familiar foe: blue cities and states with “sanctuary” policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

During his first term, Trump tried to withhold federal public safety grants from states and localities that refused to allow local law enforcement to share information with federal immigration agents or hand over immigrants in their custody. The policy was struck down in federal court and was set to be reviewed by the Supreme Court. But the justices never decided the case before Trump left office, leaving the door open for him to try again in his second term.

Now the fight is back: Trump issued an executive order in January to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities and counties under US immigration law. The Department of Justice issued a subsequent memo implementing that order. 

But there's a key difference: Last time, Democrats were unified in their defense of sanctuary policies, seeing it as a winning issue. What's different this time is the lack of uniform opposition from Democratic leadership in some of those cities and states as the party struggles to chart a path forward on immigration. 

So far, the courts are siding with local officials. In April, a federal judge again struck down both the executive order and the DOJ directive as unconstitutional, ruling that they violated protections for the separation of powers, Congress's spending powers, and due process, as well as sought to unlawfully coerce local officials into enforcing federal immigration law. 

The court battle, however, likely isn't over. That's because Trump issued a new executive order last week directing his government to suspend federal grants to sanctuary cities and states.

This time, he used a more extensive legal toolkit. In addition to invoking federal immigration law and his constitutional authority to protect the US from “invasion,” he accuses sanctuary cities and states of crimes — including conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and harboring illegal aliens — as a basis to take away their funding. 

A representative from California Attorney General Rob Bonta's office, which has been at the forefront of the lawsuits related to sanctuary policies, told Vox that they were reviewing the legality of the order and did not rule out the possibility of a court challenge.

“The Trump Administration is attempting to create a culture of fear by trumpeting executive orders and inhumane policies that target our immigrant communities,” they said. “California is not hiding the fact that we have chosen to focus our resources on public safety instead of immigration enforcement.” 

But it's not clear that everyone in blue states is ready to resist.

Defending sanctuary policies presents a messaging challenge for Democrats. Trump's immigration policies helped propel him to victory in 2024 and remain one of the more popular elements of his agenda, even if support for them has slipped a bit recently. And some Democratic leaders aren't defending sanctuary policies as vehemently as they once did. 

The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life, from senior editor Patrick Reis.

Trump's legal battle over sanctuary cities in his first term ended without a conclusion: The case was still before the Supreme Court when he left office, and then President Joe Biden asked the justices to dismiss it, refusing to defend his predecessor's efforts to slash funding. But now Trump is trying to revive that legal battle. 

Naureen Shah, director of government affairs for the ACLU's Equality Division, argued that his latest executive order has “no legal basis,” framing it as “another example of President Trump's relentless campaign to attack the integrity of our legal system and separation of powers by targeting judges, lawyers, and other officials who refuse to comply with his extreme agenda.”

Shah said that cities and states have the right to determine how to employ their own resources. That includes 17,000 local law enforcement agencies across the country that the Trump administration is trying to deputize to carry out the president's deportation agenda. 

And the Democratic Mayors Association has argued that embracing Trump's latest executive order is not the best use of their resources. “His latest executive order is a dangerous overreach targeting sanctuary cities and does nothing to address the real challenges of our broken immigration system,” Cleveland Mayor Justin M. Bibb said in a statement on behalf of the association.

No lawsuit has been filed against the new executive order yet. But with millions on the line, it's likely to come soon. Trump is expected to appeal any ruling in favor of sanctuary cities, potentially taking it all the way to the Supreme Court yet again. 

The national debate over sanctuary policies comes at a precarious moment for Democrats on immigration. 

For a while, immigration was buoying Trump's approval ratings. Surveys have also suggested that sanctuary policies specifically are divisive, with 77 percent of Republicans and 11 percent of Democrats saying in a February NPR-Ipsos poll that they approve of efforts to defund sanctuary cities and states.

However, concerns about Trump's deportations of undocumented immigrants to El Salvador — including Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who the government admits was deported in error — seem to have recently put a dent in Trump's poll numbers. 

The Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll released on April 25 found that 53 percent of Americans overall now disapprove of Trump's handling of immigration, up from 48 percent in February. That may mean that the public approval of sanctuary policies is also shifting. 

That has put Democrats in a difficult position, as they face internal disagreements on how to handle the immigration issue. Some have been subdued in their defense of sanctuary policies. 

How should Democrats talk about immigration in the face of a public that remains skeptical of it, but also increasingly concerned about Trump's approach to enforcement?

It started on the 2024 campaign trail, when vulnerable Democrats, including former Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Jon Tester of Montana, came out against sanctuary policies. Both lost their seats.

The phenomenon has continued after Trump assumed office. California Gov. Gavin Newsom — who called himself a “poster child for sanctuary policy” during his 2017 campaign — has refrained from even using the word “sanctuary” publicly. He has also promised to veto (for a second time) legislation that would provide new “sanctuary” protections to immigrants in state custody. 

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore has advocated for due process in Abrego Garcia's case and has said that he would protect Marylanders in the face of Trump's immigration policies. But he hasn't ruled out cooperating with US Immigration Customs and Enforcement, saying in January that local cities and counties need to “follow the Constitution” while declining to elaborate on what that meant. 

“We are going to make sure that our local jurisdictions are going to follow the Constitution,” Moore said. “We are cooperating to ensure that we are getting violent offenders off of our streets and out of our neighborhoods, frankly, regardless of where they come from.”

San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan has objected to the term “sanctuary,” telling CalMatters that it's been “politicized by both ends of the ideological spectrum.” San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie has also avoided using the term “sanctuary” and refused to sign a nonbinding resolution reaffirming the city's sanctuary protections, saying it was his policy to “not to comment or act on urging resolutions.”

New York City Mayor Eric Adams has signaled an openness to working with the Trump administration to arrest certain immigrants connected to “violent migrant gangs.” Though his case is unique given the controversies that have haunted his administration, and he is running for reelection as an independent.

Adams met with Trump “border czar” Tom Homan earlier this year and issued an executive order to reopen US Immigration and Customs Enforcement's ICE's office on Rikers Island, the city's largest jail, a move that the city council has sought to block. 

The New York City comptroller has also demanded that Adams recuse himself from all matters related to the city's sanctuary policies, including any response to Trump's latest executive order that could see the city stripped of federal grants. Earlier this year, Adams was accused of making a “quid pro quo” deal with the Trump administration to cooperate on immigration enforcement in exchange for federal prosecutors dropping criminal charges against him; Adams has denied those allegations.

The Adams administration has been “muted, if not muzzled, in its response to the very clear and explicit threats to our City's federal funding and New Yorkers' civil liberties,” Comptroller Brad Lander wrote in a letter to Adams on April 29.

A representative for Adams' office contested that the mayor has taken steps to advocate for New Yorkers when the federal government threatened the city's FEMA funding, an offshore wind project, and congestion pricing plan, saying that Lander's demands were “desperate and detached from reality.”

While Adams isn't representative of the typical Democrat, the debate in New York reflects a larger one within the party: How should they talk about immigration in the face of a public that remains skeptical of it, but also increasingly concerned about Trump's approach to enforcement? 

The tensions over sanctuary policies suggest that Democrats haven't yet reached a resolution.

Books for midnight baby feedings, contemporary nonfiction masters, and novels as good as the classics.

​​Welcome to Ask a Book Critic, a members-only feature packed with personalized book recommendations from senior correspondent and resident book critic Constance Grady. To get your own recommendation, ask Constance here, and subscribe to the newsletter here.

I am due with a baby at the end of this month, and anticipate many half-hour, middle-of-the-night reading sessions while feeding the babe. I would love to start a series that can keep my interest, isn't too difficult to read in short bursts, and interesting enough it can keep me from the temptation of phone scrolling. I'm not a huge fan of sci-fi and typically lean toward fiction or historical fiction. I'd definitely be open to trying some mysteries or thrillers as well if you've got ideas!

Since you're looking for a historical fiction series, you should get on Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall books if you haven't already, because they are just as good as everyone says. (Albeit perhaps a bit dense for midnight feeding sessions!) 

I'd also recommend Nicola Griffiths's Hild series, which has published two of a planned three volumes, Hild and Menewood. They tell the story of a teenage girl in medieval Britain who navigates court politics, intermittent war, and a shifting religious landscape on her journey to becoming Saint Hilda of Whitby, one of the kingmakers of her era. Griffith's got a great touch for all the tactile details of living in preindustrial England — the food, the spices, the cloth, the herbs. One of the deep pleasures of these books is watching all the different religious sects of the Middle Ages jockey for recognition from kings who will follow any god who can get them a win.

If the Hild books start feeling too heavy, let's turn to mysteries. Agatha Christie can be your friend here, as can Dorothy Sayers; they both have detective series that go on forever without any appreciable dip in quality. For something more modern, Louise Penny's Armand Gamache detective novels are beloved and, not for nothing, are known for really good food writing too.

I want to dive into more contemporary fiction, but struggle to find writing that appeals to my Dickensian and Dostoyevskian sensibilities. I want character-driven. I want beautifully sculpted sentences. I don't want romantasy, I want Heathcliff. I want Jane in the red room and the Demeter at Whitby. I want to hear the beat of the heart under the floor boards. I want to visit José Arcadio Buendía at the tree. I want to see the things fall apart and to know both war and peace. I'm willing to cross the genre wilderness and dive into any culture, but the writing and characters have to grab me. I have found contemporary authors I love — Anthony Doerr, Amor Towles, and Kazuo Ishiguro, for example. I know there are others, please help me find them!

I can respect 19th-century taste. The contemporary author who writes the most plush, Dickensian sentences I know of is Sarah Parry. Start with her novel The Essex Serpent, which brings a contemporary psychoanalytical lens to a lurid Victorian fantasia of a plot about a massive sea serpent terrorizing a small town. 

It's a very rich, textured, Crime and Punishment-in-couture kind of a book.

For your Slavic cravings, the novelist Elif Batuman has a degree in Russian literature and titled her debut novel The Idiot after Dostoevsky. It's a much more constrained, specific novel than its inspiration, and it may or may not be to your taste, but it's worth looking at regardless. Finally, my friend (and former Vox colleague) Tara Isabella Burton has a PhD in theology from Oxford, and she thinks a lot about both sin and Dostoevsky in her novel Social Creature. It's a very rich, textured, Crime and Punishment-in-couture kind of a book.

John McPhee is my all-time favorite author — I haven't read anything by him that I haven't liked. Alas, he is very old. What are some similar fairly current narrative nonfiction books?

Have you read David Grann? He wrote Killers of the Flower Moon, which Martin Scorsese used as the source material for his 2023 movie, and last year's The Wager, about an 18th-century naval voyage that turned into a nightmarish shipwreck. He's got an impeccable eye for how to structure a nonfiction story like a novel — famously, he modeled Killers of the Flower Moon on Absalom, Absalom! with its layers of perspective allowing revelations to accumulate slowly, like layers of earth. 

I also have my eye on Sophie Elmhirst's forthcoming book, A Marriage at Sea, which tells the story of a couple who were lost at sea for 118 days in the 1970s. It won the Nero in the UK when it came out there last year, and when I read the first chapter, I had trouble putting it down. It comes out in the US in July.

Aging could be about to change for women forever.

by  Anna North

Will my generation be the last to go through menopause?

Just a few years ago, that would've seemed like a bizarre question — I've always assumed that I and every other human being with ovaries would eventually experience what my grandmother called “the change of life.” But now, researchers are calling into question what once seemed like basic facts of human existence. “What if menopause happened later?” they are asking. “What if it never happened at all?“

In recent years, patients have gained access to a wider variety of medications to treat menopausal symptoms like hot flashes and vaginal dryness. But newer treatments, one already in clinical trials, go deeper: The goal is not just to treat the symptoms, but to actually slow down ovarian aging so that the hormonal changes associated with midlife happen later — or maybe even never. “For the first time in medical history, we have the ability to potentially delay or eliminate menopause,” Kutluk Oktay, a reproductive surgeon and an ovarian biologist at Yale University, said in a release last year.

I cover reproductive health, and my inbox has been filling up for months with news of research like this. As an elder millennial barreling toward the uncertainty of perimenopause (which some research suggests can start as early as one's 30s), I've received these updates with interest, sure, but also with a fair amount of trepidation. 

On the one hand, the loss of estrogen that comes with menopause is associated with a host of illnesses and conditions, from cardiovascular disease to osteoporosis. Delaying the menopausal transition even five years “would result in an enormous improvement in terms of women's health and decreased mortality,” Zev Williams, director of the Columbia University Fertility Center, told me. “It's a really exciting opportunity.”

On the other hand, the idea of getting rid of menopause can feel like yet another way of insisting that women remain young and fertile forever. At a time when JD Vance is talking dismissively about the “purpose of the postmenopausal female,” I'm unsettled by the prospect of treating women's aging out of their childbearing years, in particular, as something that must be cured. 

If the idea of stopping menopause is a fraught one, though, it's also an opportunity to think about what we want from our later lives, and to consider what it would look like to balance the real medical concerns of midlife and beyond with the fact that women are flesh-and-blood human beings who, like everyone else, get old. As Ashton Applewhite, author of the book This Chair Rocks: A Manifesto Against Ageism, put it to me, “you can't stop aging, or you're dead.”

To understand menopause, it helps to understand a little bit about ovaries, the human reproductive organs that store and release eggs. Starting in puberty, these glands ramp up their production of estrogen, a hormone that leads to breast development and a host of other changes to the body. Throughout the reproductive years, the ovaries make estrogen and other hormones according to a monthly cycle to help prepare the body for potential pregnancy. 

Starting around a person's late 30s, however, estrogen production starts to drop off. By the mid-40s, people typically enter perimenopause, which means “around menopause.” This period is characterized by unpredictable ups and downs in estrogen, though on a general downward trend (Mary Jane Minkin, an OB-GYN who teaches at the Yale School of Medicine, likens the pattern to the stock market during the Great Recession). That hormonal decline can lead to symptoms like irregular periods, hot flashes, and night sweats. 

A lot of the symptoms most commonly associated with menopause actually start in perimenopause, and they can range from annoying to devastating. Perimenopause has been getting a lot of media attention lately, along with more focus from brands who may want to sell you stuff to help you manage it. Problems like hot flashes and brain fog can cause women to miss work, resulting in $1.8 billion in lost work productivity in the US per year, according to one study. The loss of estrogen can cause vaginal dryness, which can cause discomfort during sex and, in some cases, constant pain.

At some point, the ovaries stop producing eggs, and menstruation stops entirely. This is menopause, and it's diagnosed when someone has gone without a period for a full year. It happens at an average age of 51, though Black and Latina women reach menopause earlier than white and some Asian American women. Though some symptoms, like dryness, persist after menopause, others, like hot flashes, often resolve, Minkin told me.

Hormonal changes in the body around menopause are also linked with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, Stephanie Faubion, director of the Mayo Clinic's Center for Women's Health and medical director of the Menopause Society, told me. Blood pressure and cholesterol tend to rise during this time, as does insulin resistance, a condition that can lead to diabetes. Bone density also falls during and after the menopause transition, increasing the risk of osteoporosis.

Some experts believe that menopause is part of the reason women spend more time than men living with chronic diseases. “Women live longer than men,” gerontology professor Bérénice Benayoun told Vox last year, “but they usually do so in a much more frail state.”

Given all this, it's reasonable that more experts are looking at menopause and wondering, what if we could just…not?

Hormone therapy — typically estrogen taken on its own or with progesterone, sometimes in the form of birth control pills — already exists to treat the symptoms of menopause. The treatment was stigmatized for decades after a 2002 study linked it to breast cancer and other ailments, but doctors now say the benefits often outweigh the risks. Taking estrogen can dramatically reduce hot flashes, and even reduce cardiovascular risk while patients are on the medication.

When you look at illnesses and conditions like dementia, heart disease, and stroke, “there's a much, much lower rate in women compared to men, until ovarian function stops. Then they start to catch up,” Williams said. “If we have a way of extending the ovarian lifespan in a way that's safe, then you're allowing the ovary to provide all these incredible health benefits” for a longer period of time.

Estrogen therapy can replace some of the estrogen a person's ovaries are no longer producing, but it doesn't actually stop those organs' decline. To do that, some researchers are looking at more involved procedures. 

In one recent study, Oktay, the Yale biologist, and his team used a mathematical model to predict how a technique called ovarian tissue cryopreservation might work in healthy patients. The process, typically used in cancer patients undergoing treatment that could harm their fertility, involves removing a section of ovary, freezing it, and reimplanting it at a later date. This technique, if used in healthy patients under 40, “would result in a significant delay in menopause,” according to the study.

Oktay and his team have begun preserving ovarian tissue from healthy patients, with the goal of reintroducing it when the patients are close to menopause. Since the women are still young, the team will have to wait years for real-world results, Oktay told me. But the technique does work to restore ovarian function in cancer survivors, he said. 

About 10 percent of women enter menopause at age 55 or older, Oktay told me, and they tend to have longer life expectancy and less risk of osteoporosis and diabetes than people who go through the transition earlier. “We're saying, why not make everybody that lucky?”

Williams, the Columbia Fertility Center director, and his team are working on a different, less invasive option. They're currently in the midst of their first human trial of rapamycin, an oral medication typically used as an immunosuppressant in higher doses. Rapamycin has been found to extend lifespan in some animal studies, suggesting to some that it might help humans live longer. Williams and his team have also found that the drug can extend ovarian function and fertility in mice. 

The Columbia researchers are now monitoring 50 women between the ages of 35 and 45 who have taken either rapamycin or a placebo, asking them questions about their mood, memory, and sleep quality, as well as checking their ovarian function through blood work and ultrasounds. They don't have results yet, but they've seen no serious side effects so far.

The goal isn't just to extend fertility, though “as a fertility specialist, that's obviously something that I think about all the time,” Williams said. It's also about extending the benefits that ovaries provide to women's health, potentially reducing their lifetime risk of chronic illness.

Research like Williams's has generated significant excitement, as the idea of pushing back menopause starts to move into the mainstream. Toward the end of the Biden administration, Jill Biden launched a women's health initiative dedicated to studying the idea.

The ovaries are “the only organ in humans that we just accept will fail one day,” Renee Wegrzyn, director of the agency in charge of the first lady's initiative, told the New York Times last year. “It's actually kind of wild that we all just accept that.”

Some are skeptical, though, that delaying or eliminating menopause would be an entirely good idea.

For one thing, the link between menopause and illness isn't completely clear-cut. People who go through menopause later tend to have better health outcomes, “but is it chicken or egg?” Faubion asked. “Do their ovaries last longer because they're otherwise in better general health than the other people that go through menopause early?”

Prolonging ovarian function — and thus increasing people's lifetime exposure to estrogen — could also come with risks of its own, like increases in breast cancer or blood clots, which have been linked to the hormone, Faubion said (going through menopause after age 55 is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer). For some, the tradeoffs might be worth it, but it's not necessarily true that later menopause would mean better health across the board.

With more invasive treatments, there are also other questions to consider. “What are the ethics of taking out a healthy organ from a healthy person” — a surgical procedure that could fail — “all in the name of ‘delaying menopause?'” Faubion asked. 

Oktay, the biologist studying ovarian tissue cryopreservation, told me the procedure is a minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery, and can be performed at the same time as another abdominal surgery like a C-section. Many participants in his study have a family history of severe menopause complications or conditions that can worsen with menopause, he said, giving them a reason to want to delay the transition.

For Minkin, the Yale gynecologist, the experimental treatments are intriguing if they can extend fertility. But for dealing with the physical challenges of menopause, she's not sure they're necessary: “There are plenty of easy ways to give people hormones.”

Some people, including survivors of certain cancers, aren't able to take hormones, and new treatments could be helpful for them. Meanwhile, some experts see delaying menopause as most beneficial for people who experience the transition early. About one percent of women go through menopause before age 40, and five percent before age 45. Cancer treatments or autoimmune conditions can cause early menopause, but sometimes, the cause is unknown. Since early menopause is associated with elevated health risks, a new way to treat it “would probably result in a net benefit for population health,” Nanette Santoro, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, told Time.

Going through menopause early can be deeply upsetting to people, especially (though not exclusively) if they're hoping to have children. But when it happens at the average time, this stage of life can come with social and emotional benefits, despite the physical challenges. 

“It's liberating,” Applewhite told me. “No more mood swings, no more worries about getting pregnant.”

“I don't know any woman, including yourself, who wants to be bleeding every single month,” Denise Pines, creator of the menopause summit WisePause, told me.

Indeed, research has found that women often become happier as they age, especially after midlife — potentially because they're less consumed with caring for children and other family members. Some anthropologists believe that female humans, unlike other animals, live beyond their reproductive years to help care for grandchildren (it's called the “grandmother hypothesis”). But Minkin offered a more expansive view of this theory: In early human settlements, pregnant people couldn't do heavy labor like moving rocks around. The grandmother was “somebody who moves the rocks,” she said. She also described postmenopausal women as “shooting saber-toothed tigers.”

Even the troublesome symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes and night sweats, can be a useful “disruptor” in people's lives, Pines said. “Where women have been so giving and outwardly focused, suddenly you have to focus on yourself.”

“That gives you a chance to reset everything else around you,” from relationships to career, Pines said. “It's such a great time to really reimagine who we are.”

Applewhite welcomes the recent surge in awareness around menopause, and says hormone therapy to treat its symptoms can be helpful — “I'm not saying, keep your body pure and avoid the temptations of Western medicine.” But when it comes to putting off menopause or eliminating it entirely, she said it's concerning “when inevitable transitions of aging are pathologized.” That's especially true for women's aging, which is doubly stigmatized in American culture. “Under patriarchy, a woman's value is linked to her reproductive value,” Applewhite said. It's why there's so little research into the health of older women: “because we are no longer reproductively useful.”

As appealing as the idea of extending a person's healthy lifespan is, I can't quite get past the ovary of it all. I, too, have heard from post-menopausal people about the liberation they feel when they exit their reproductive years. I, too, have at times been frustrated by doctors' focus on my reproductive capacity over other aspects of my health. I want to be healthy as I get older, but I also want to accept my aging (and for the people around me to accept it), rather than feeling constant pressure to stave it off.

Applewhite wants women of all ages to see “later life as a time of enormous power and liberation and possibility,” and I'd like to see it that way too, not as something to be avoided at all costs.

When I shared some of these concerns with Williams, he asked me if I'd feel the same trepidation around treatments that focused on other areas of the body. “You want to extend normal heart function, liver function,” he said. But “for some reason, if you say, we want to slow ovarian aging, that touches on a very different note.”

It's a fair point, especially since a lot of the health outcomes he and others are trying to promote aren't about fertility or attractiveness or any of the attributes our culture demands that women maintain in our quest to remain forever young — they're about things like cardiovascular and mental health. I want those!

Williams argued that understanding ovarian aging might actually remove some of the negative messages around menopause and getting older more generally. He also studies recurrent miscarriage, which “has always had a tremendous amount of stigma associated with it.” What's helped reduce that stigma has been “when it goes away from this realm of myth and taboo and folklore, and we start to understand the process,” he says.

It's worth noting that research into menopause, like so much work on reproductive health and indeed health in general, is imperiled under the Trump administration. When I tried to visit the website for Jill Biden's menopause initiative, I found that it was gone. Renee Wegrzyn, the head of the initiative, was fired in February. In a time when a lot of medical research is simply disappearing, it's hard to look askance at treatments that could improve people's lives.

After talking to Williams and other experts, I'm not against the idea of a medication that could help people live longer without heart attacks or cognitive decline. But as I get older, I'm also keenly aware that what happens outside our bodies can affect our health as much as what happens inside them. 

When I asked Pines what she'd like to see for people in perimenopause and menopause right now, she said she wants a future when people in this stage of life “are not dismissed,” when “we can talk about menopause the same way we talk about puberty.” She'd also like to see workplaces support women experiencing perimenopause symptoms, including by offering insurance plans that cover the treatment of them. And she wants OB-GYNs, internists, and other doctors to be specifically trained in perimenopause and menopause, something that's often lacking.

“When we have those kinds of things in place,” she said, our society “will start looking at aging and aging women differently.”

Marc Andreessen thinks artificial intelligence can do every job in the world — except his

Marc Andreessen is, arguably, the most famous venture capitalist on earth. Cofounder of the legendary VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, inventor of the first popular web browser, and by reputation such a widely read intellectual egghead that his colleagues call him ""MarcGPT."" And as befits his nickname, Andreessen is a big believer in a future powered by artificial intelligence. His firm — ""a16z"" to Silicon Valley sophisticates — has invested in Elon Musk's xAI and Sam Altman's OpenAI. Andreessen has called AI ""our alchemy, our Philosopher's Stone,"" and ""a universal problem solver"" that ""ramps up the capabilities of our machines and ourselves.""

But for Andreessen, there is one job that AI will never do as well as a living, breathing human being: his.

Think I'm kidding? On an a16z podcast last week, Andreessen opined that being a venture capitalist may be a profession that is ""quite literally timeless."" ""When the AIs are doing everything else,"" he continued, ""that may be one of the last remaining fields that people are still doing.""

Here's the logic. Andreessen starts by talking about all the things that people thought might disrupt the way VCs operate — like the Craigslist-style approach of AngelList, or crowdfunding. ""The other form of structural change, of course, is AI,"" Andreessen says. Then he issues a challenge to the AI crowd: ""All right, smart guys. You're sitting around doing all this analysis, and you have all these smart people doing all this modeling and all this research and so forth. Why can't you just plug this into Claude or ChatGPT or Gemini and have it tell you what to invest in?""

The reason, Andreessen explains, is that it takes a VC like him to know how to pick a winner. He throws out a bunch of examples, going all the way back to the whaling industry 500 years ago: book publishers, movie studio executives, talent scouts at music labels. (I'll spare you the details here, but I spoke with an economist who has analyzed the whaling industry, and he says MarcGPT is pretty much wrong on every count.) Andreessen insists that these are key jobs that spring up ""any time you have a part of the economy in which you have an entrepreneur going on a high-risk, high-return endeavor where it is far from clear what is going to work, and there are many more aspirants than there is money to fund them.""

Here, Andreessen argues, is where the human element is irreplaceable. ""You're not just funding them,"" he says. ""You have to actually work with them to execute the entire project. That's art. That's not science. That's art. We would like it to be science, but, like, it's art.""

Now correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like a lot of AI folks have been trying to tell us that AI can make art. Last year, even Andreessen said that AI had enough of a sense of humor to ""save comedy."" But apparently it can't do his art.

Which brings us to the wildest bit. Andreessen says he knows that venture investing is an ineffable, intuitive, intrinsically human skill precisely because venture capitalists are very bad at it. ""The great VCs have a success rate of getting, I don't know, two out of 10 of the great companies of the decade, right?"" he says. ""If it was science, you could eventually have somebody who just dials in and gets eight out of 10. But in the real world, it's not like that. You're in the fluke business, and there's an intangibility to it. There's a taste aspect.""

Even accepting Andreessen's premise — that VCs contribute better advice than AI on how to run a business — it looks like he's wrong about whether he's replaceable. In a recent survey by the enterprise software company SAP, 75% of C-level executives at billion-dollar companies said AI already gives better business advice than their friends and colleagues. And 38% said they trust AI to make business decisions. The kind of people Andreessen counts on for his livelihood are already starting to think he's obsolete.

But Andreessen's portrait of how venture capital works doesn't actually accord with reality. VC investors say they're looking for disruptive innovation. In practice, they have operated pretty much like any good-old-boy network, consistently funding way more white men than women or people of color — often the same white men they knew from previous startups, whether they succeeded or not. And economists say it's an open question whether VCs actually add value or are just the most basic kind of ""pickers,"" identifying companies that would have been successful without them. That's the kind of operation that large language models are pretty good at. Identifying patterns in big sets of data is, like, their whole thing.

I actually kind of agree with Andreessen. I'm skeptical that any form of AI — much less the generative, chatbot-type products of OpenAI or Google — will ever be able to do high-level critical and creative thinking as well as a human. But the reality is, the quality of the AI's work might not matter. History is essentially one big graveyard of artisanal jobs that wound up being automated, even though the automation produced an objectively inferior product. Andreessen, like so many of us, wants to think he's special — that no machine can ever do what he does. But he can't have it both ways. If he's right that artificial intelligence can't perform the kinds of skills his job requires, then he's wrong to be investing in companies that promise it can.

In any case, when Andreessen says ""AI can't do my job,"" the job he's describing isn't a venture capitalist. It's not even a run-of-the-mill investor, who buys stock in a company. The core function that Andreessen is lionizing is being a gatekeeper — the power over who gets to join the club of influence.

An AI that trained on every decision every venture capitalist ever made and tried to make them line up with various definitions of success might go on to choose very different kinds of companies. In a world of vcAI, startups might finally get backed on their merit, instead of on how much their founders look and talk like Andreessen. Who knows? An AI VC's loony, black-box heuristics might favor things like whether an idea is ""good for humanity"" or ""promotes class mobility."" What if it started to hallucinate something about ""redistributing wealth""?

On this level, at least, Andreessen is probably right. No machine could ever replace him.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Meta's laid-off 'low performers' shun the label and tell their stories","https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-layoffs-low-performance-cuts-review-cycle-politics-2025-4","Tue, 06 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Months after Meta's high-profile culling of low performers, the stigma associated with the job cuts still stings.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg's push to ""raise the bar on performance"" saw about 5% of its workforce — roughly 3,600 employees — laid off in a sweeping round of cuts in February. The company said it targeted its lowest performers, but some former employees pushed back on that.

Some said they had received positive ratings months earlier. Others said they were on medical or parental leave, mid-transfer between teams, or hadn't received a formal rating yet. Some speculated that conflict with a manager was the deciding factor. As of late April, laid-off employees received severance payouts.

The eight accounts below offer a sense of how employees who were let go experienced the cuts and their concern about how it could affect their futures. BI has verified the performance records of these ex-workers, who asked for anonymity because they fear the ""low performer"" label could hurt future job prospects.

A Meta spokesperson reiterated what the company previously shared with BI earlier this year about its low-performer cuts: ""Let me be clear, these were performance-based terminations,"" the spokesperson said. ""Prior ratings were not downgraded. Simply because someone had a history of meeting or exceeding expectations does not mean they continue to consistently meet the bar.""

The spokesperson added that Meta employees are held accountable to a goal-based culture of high performance.

A former employee in Meta's human resources division had returned to work after being on parental leave for nearly five months when his division lost close to 10% of its staff. His midyear review put him ""At or Above Expectations"" — the middle tier — but his year-end rating was ""Meets Most,"" which made him eligible for termination.

""I tried calling my boss immediately, but in my heart, I knew it probably wasn't an error — Meta wouldn't make a mistake that significant."" He said the manager was distressed but repeated: ""I can't say anything. It's just part of Mark's mandate. It's a hard year.""

He said he didn't know why his rating had fallen. ""We can't even see the feedback our managers wrote for us,"" he said.

""Once the shock wore off, there was actually a mix of emotions — including some relief at being freed from that situation."" But he does worry about carrying the low-performer label.

""It's one thing to be let go in a restructuring,"" he said. ""It's another to have your professional reputation potentially damaged by being mischaracterized as an underperformer.""

A former senior machine learning engineer at Meta described the shock of being laid off, only for a Meta recruiter to invite her to reapply three days later and skip the interview process.

""Same email address. Same person. No acknowledgment of what had just happened. It felt surreal,"" she said.

She said she joined Meta in early 2024 and earned a midyear review of ""At or Above Expectations."" Initially rated ""Meets All Expectations"" in the January 2025 year-end review, she was downgraded to ""Meets Most Expectations"" after a second round of director-level reviews. She said she suspects ""directors were under pressure to hit a layoff quota.""

Before the layoff, she was dissatisfied with her manager and sought a transfer to a top-tier team. It was approved, but she was told the move could lower her rating, so she waited — only to be pink-slipped. She said she's not taking the recruiter up on her offer.

Ultimately, she's confident she can land or create her next opportunity.

""I'll be fine. I can get another job or start something of my own.""

This software engineer who joined Meta in May 2024 to work on cross-platform content sharing said a promising start unraveled because of internal politics over a new feature he prototyped. He said he took a four-month leave for burnout in August and returned in December to complete two more projects.

Two weeks before the layoffs, he said, his new manager told the team everyone was ""safe."" Then came the termination email — and a performance rating of ""Meets Some Expectations,"" low on Meta's end-of-year rating scale.

""How could they evaluate my performance when I'd only worked 10 weeks in 2024?"" he said, adding that an HR director had said he was ""too new to evaluate.""

Although he's now fielding interest from other companies and expects to receive 16 weeks of severance, he still feels the sting of his rating. ""The harmful 'low performer' label still feels wrong,"" he said.

This product manager joined Facebook as a contractor in 2018, converted to full time in 2020, and consistently received a year-end ""Greatly Exceeds Expectations"" ratings label.

In 2023, when she moved to Reality Labs, ""everything changed,"" she said.

""My manager would call late at night to question my capabilities and create doubt, even though teammates gave me positive feedback,"" she said.

A review in early 2024 dropped her two tiers to ""Meets All Expectations."" Feedback included accusations that she was ""blinded"" by a ""desire for promotion,"" she said. In August, she took a 12-week disability leave ""because I was physically ill from all the stress."" She returned in November and was laid off in February.

She's being ""selective"" in her hunt for a new job. ""The experience damaged my health, affected my family, and forced me onto medication for anxiety. I need to walk away from toxicity at the first sign, not wait until it affects my health and family again.""

A technical program manager was laid off after seven years of good performance ratings at Meta.

A reorganization placed her under a new manager a few months earlier — a shift she felt exposed her. ""When managers have to meet quotas and choose someone to cut, people with less history on the team are at higher risk,"" she said.

""I contacted my manager in shock"" after the termination notice, she said. ""I just wanted five minutes to talk to ensure I wasn't going crazy."" The manager responded with a templated email — the same company-approved language she had been required to use the day before when laying off her own direct report.

She still doesn't know exactly what led to their selection. ""Was it because I had significant equity vested when the stock price was low?"" she said. "" Was it because I expressed disappointment about Meta rolling back DEI programs on internal forums? I'll never know — but there's clearly more to this story than simply cutting the lowest performers.""

After 14 years at Google and three at Meta, a program manager said she was laid off despite a strong performance record: ""At Meta, I'd even received 'Exceeds Expectations' and the rare 'Redefines Expectations.'"" She said her manager told her she was doing ""a great job"" at the midyear review.

""I was candid with my manager — sometimes critically, but always constructively — about where I thought things could improve,"" she said. ""I was transparent about how stress in my personal life was affecting me: My husband had been laid off, and we were caring for a special-needs child.""

She said her manager told her not to worry, but she'd noticed a shift in tone at Meta — for example, when chief technology officer Andrew ""Boz"" Bosworth said a worker who alleged mistreatment should just quit.

""The compassionate tone of the 2022 layoffs — the regret, the messaging about hard decisions — feels like a distant memory,"" she said. ""This round was cutthroat. Silent. Cold. 'The Hunger Games,' but for high performers.""

""I wrote a final email to my skip-level manager,"" she added. ""Not to get my job back. Not even to get a reply (I didn't). I just wanted to be heard. To say: I know I did good work. I know I didn't deserve this. And I hope someone — anyone — in leadership still has the humanity to care.""

This employee spent four years at Meta working on internal security systems, including tools to manage insider threats. He spent the weekend before the cuts making sure those would run smoothly on the day of the layoffs.

He had received consistently strong performance ratings and said his managers agreed he was on track, but his termination letter assigned him a ""Meets Most Expectations"" rating. He said his managers didn't look at the self-review he submitted. ""That told me everything. This wasn't about performance,"" he said. ""This was about filling quotas.""

""My manager said he 'stood by' the rating but wished he'd had more time and freedom to talk things through.""

In his view, the company culture had grown increasingly cutthroat, with employees clinging to projects to boost their ratings, jockeying within the performance curve, and seeing dissent increasingly punished.

""Many people stay because the compensation is hard to walk away from, not because they believe in the mission. I was one of them. It was a place that offered scale and learning, but at a steep emotional cost,"" he said, adding that his healthy salary would have made him ""an easy target"" for cost-cutters.

An engineer was laid off after five months of leave for a serious health crisis while in the middle of disability-related negotiations. He said his final performance rating — ""Meets Most Expectations"" — felt like ""a scarlet letter.""

""I wasn't underperforming,"" he said. Peer reviews before the leave had been entirely positive, and he saved ""screenshots of it all for my lawyer.""

His compensation exceeded $500,000, making him the highest-paid person on the team after his manager. He said he worked 60 to 75 hours before falling ill, but he sensed resentment after raising burnout concerns and stepping away from a major project.

""And after the layoff? Nothing. She didn't even say goodbye.""

He said Meta branding of laid-off workers as low performers ""sets a dangerous precedent — companies can quietly rewrite the story of your career, and you don't get to fight back.""

He's exploring legal options. ""Meta is telling one story,"" he said. ""And for many of us, it's not the truth.""

Help wanted: X is looking for a PR guru to boost its reputation.

Since Elon Musk bought the platform formerly known as Twitter, its relationship with advertisers and reporters has been fraught.

X is now looking for a communications leader to help improve its relationship with reporters, multiple people familiar with the matter told Business Insider. One person who was contacted by a recruiter said the remit was described as helping craft the company's public image. The job has been vacant since Dave Heinzinger left his role as head of media strategy earlier this year. The person would work closely with CEO Linda Yaccarino, who's been trying to rebuild X's ads business.

The company saw an exodus of advertisers after Musk acquired it in October 2022, though there have been some recent signs that the company's ad revenue is turning around. In 2023, Musk lashed out at advertisers directly, telling those that had stopped spending on the platform to ""go fuck yourself."" And X is suing 11 advertisers, alleging they collectively conspired to boycott the platform in contravention of antitrust laws. The case is ongoing.

On the media front, Musk has attacked journalists by name on the platform.

X has also been criticized for loosening moderation and account verification rules and reinstating some banned accounts of provocative figures. Separately, Musk has used the platform to tout MAGA messaging and promote President Donald Trump, stirring division among users. In March, Musk said his startup xAI acquired X in an all-stock deal.

X has had a revolving door of comms execs in the past year. Joe Benarroch, a longtime associate of Yaccarino's, left in June after a year. Nick Pickles, a legacy Twitter employee who was vice president of global affairs, followed him out the door in September. Then Heinzinger, a public relations vet, came in December and stayed for just three months before returning to his former role as president of Haymaker Group. John Stoll, a former Wall Street Journal editor who was hired in January to head up a news and partnerships team, has taken on comms duties while the role has been vacant.

People in PR circles credited X for being self-aware in trying to expand its operation and said it would take someone with an uncommon sense of adventure to fill such a role.

""It certainly would be the challenge of a lifetime,"" one person said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Tesla's robotaxi will compete with Waymo in Austin. Here's how the two companies compare.","https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-waymo-robotaxi-comparison-2025-5","Tue, 06 May 2025 08:43:00 GMT","

In June, Tesla is set to roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, going bumper to bumper with Waymo.

Austin is the first city where Tesla plans to test its tech with consumers. Alphabet-backed Waymo launched its robotaxi service in the city in March after already rolling out the service in three other cities over the past five years.

Ahead of the launch, Elon Musk has taken several digs at Waymo, including joking during the carmaker's earnings call earlier this month that Waymo costs ""'way mo' money.""

""I don't see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,"" Musk said.

Meanwhile, Waymo's former CEO, John Krafcik, accused Tesla of being all talk and no action.

""Although Tesla hopes to compete with Waymo someday, they've failed utterly and completely at this for each of the 10 years they've been talking about it,"" he said in an emailed statement to Business Insider.

Tesla's Austin launch will mark a crucial chapter in a yearslong debate over the best self-driving training methods and whether success will come from Tesla's big swings or Waymo's gradual deployment.

Take a look at how Tesla and Waymo compare when it comes to autonomous driving technology.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. A Waymo spokesperson referred BI to previous blog posts on the company's early rides and continued testing in cities across the US.

Tesla and Waymo have taken radically different approaches to training their AI systems for self-driving. Tesla has relied on a vision-based approach that uses a suite of eight cameras and minimal reliance on external sensors.

Musk has said that Tesla began removing lidar sensors from its test vehicles in 2021, calling the technology an expensive ""crutch."" The carmaker has a lidar- and radar-equipped vehicle called the Ground Truth Machine that it uses for training purposes, but only for edge cases of rare or unusual driving scenarios, BI previously reported.

Waymo's Jaguar I-PACE robotaxis are outfitted with five lidar sensors, six radars, and 29 cameras that help its AI software navigate its environment, a company spokesperson said. The company says its next-generation Waymo Driver will have a reduced and cheaper sensor suite.

Before Waymo robotaxis are deployed for public rides, Waymo uses safety drivers to map out a city like San Francisco or Tokyo, creating highly detailed maps.

The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) ranks self-driving vehicles on a scale from zero to five — five being the holy grail of autonomous driving in which a driverless vehicle can go anywhere under any environmental conditions, according to SAE. Tesla has said it operates as a Level 2 vehicle, meaning that it operates as a driver-assist software with a human driver still behind the wheel.

In California, where Tesla does much of its in-house testing, the carmaker is required to secure a permit for Level 3 and above testing. Tesla has not reported using the permit, which allows the self-driving software to operate with a safety driver but even more autonomy, since 2019. The company told the California DMV in December that it was currently operating as a Level 2 vehicle in the state, according to documents viewed by BI.

Waymo, along with Zoox and Nuro, is one of the few companies that has deployed Level 4 autonomous driving in the real world, which means the vehicle does not require a driver behind the wheel and is fully autonomous.

Waymo robotaxis have limitations. The vehicles cannot travel beyond areas programmed into their system, and the company hasn't yet offered robotaxi service in cities that experience more extreme weather, such as snow. A Waymo spokesperson said the company has invested in weather testing.

Tesla has a more consumer-focused business model. The company sells beta versions of its Full Self-Driving software for $8,000, or $99 a month. The software requires a licensed driver to supervise the vehicle, but it can switch lanes, recognize stop lights, and enter and exit highways.

While the company is also working on building up a commercial robotaxi fleet, Musk has said Tesla owners will one day be able to rent out their cars as a self-driving service, akin to Uber or Airbnb.

Waymo's business is primarily focused on delivering an autonomous rideshare service through Waymo One or through its partnership with rideshare platforms such as Uber.

Unlike Tesla, Waymo does not manufacture cars in-house and instead relies on partnerships with OEMs to build out its robotaxi fleet, partnering with Jaguar, Chrysler, Hyundai, and Toyota.

Waymo has signaled interest in bringing its autonomous technology to personally owned vehicles. On April 29, Waymo revealed that it was in early talks with Toyota to explore bringing autonomy to consumer cars.

Tesla has said it aims to roll out the service in Austin in June and in other US cities within the year. The company is still getting regulatory approval in California, but has several in-house test drivers operating in cities across the country, including Phoenix, Dallas, New York, and Miami.

During the carmaker's earnings call in April, Musk said that Tesla owners would be able to drive their vehicles autonomously within the year. Musk has said that Tesla will eventually deploy its services globally.

Waymo has chosen to gradually roll out its service in select cities. As of April, Waymo's robotaxis are offering fully driverless rides to the public in limited parts of the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Austin.

The company is currently testing in Atlanta, Washington, DC, Las Vegas, Miami, San Diego, and Tokyo.

It's difficult to compare Tesla and Waymo's mileage reports.

Tesla has not released any information on how often humans need to take control of its self-driving systems or how many miles its cars have driven without intervention. In its most recent earnings report, the company said users of its beta FSD software have driven a cumulative 3.6 billion miles. The company also released an update in April that Tesla engineers had driven about 15,000 miles using an internal version of its robotaxi app.

Waymo has said that its robotaxis have traveled 56.7 million miles as of January, miles driven without human supervision. The company said it provides over 250,000 rides a week as of April.

Tesla has not said how much the service will cost, but has said the price will be comparable to booking an Uber. Right now, Tesla owners pay a $8,000 flat fee or $99 a month to use the beta version of FSD.

As with Uber and Lyft, Waymo's price can vary depending on the city and demand.

One study conducted last year by Evercore ISI of 1,000 trips offered by Waymo, Uber, and Lyft found that Waymo's price point had essentially reached parity with existing rideshare platforms by the fourth quarter of 2024.

While Waymo was more expensive at about $24 per ride in mid-2024, Waymo's average fare dropped nearly 10% to around $22 by the end of 2024.

This brought Waymo in line with traditional rideshare options, with UberX at about $21 and Lyft at roughly $22 during the same period. The analysts noted that the Uber and Lyft prices didn't include driver tips, unlike the all-inclusive Waymo fare.

South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam are cracking down on methods used by Chinese exporters to avoid President Donald Trump's high tariffs.

A growing tactic used by some Chinese exporters is to ship products through neighbouring countries to falsely claim the goods are not Chinese and avoid tariffs of up to 145% in place on Chinese goods imported to the US.

Jaya Wen, a professor in the Business, Government, and the International Economy Unit at Harvard Business School, told Business Insider that if goods undergo a ""substantial transformation"" in the intermediate country, they merit a change in their place of origin.

Wen, who researches trade re-routing, said value-added production has increased since tariffs were introduced and is a legitimate method for Chinese companies to avoid tariffs.

But illegal rerouting and relabeling through a third country, where no value is added to products, also appears to be taking place, she said.

In this strategy, firms take finished products, ship them to Vietnam, for example, and re-label them from ""Made in China"" to ""Made in Vietnam."" This was happening before the current wave of tariffs, she said.

The White House's senior trade advisor, Peter Navarro, raised concerns about this process in an interview with CNBC in April, saying that Chinese businesses were ""trans-shipping to Vietnam to evade tariffs.""

In April, South Korea's customs agency said that it had seized over $20 million worth of products with falsified countries of origin in the first quarter of 2025, local news outlet The Korea Times reported. The majority of products were destined for the US.

""We are seeing a sharp increase in recent cases where our country is used as a bypass for products to avoid different tariffs and restrictions because of the US government's trade policy changes,"" the agency said in a press briefing, according to Reuters.

The agency's commissioner, Ko Kwang-hyo, said there were ""numerous cases where the origins of Chinese products were falsified as Korean,"" The Korea Times reported.

Korea's Customs Agency said it would launch a special investigation unit to crack down on the practice, and would enhance intelligence sharing with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

Similar crackdowns on counterfeit product labelling are taking place in Thailand and Vietnam,

Three directives issued in March and April by Vietnam's Ministry of Industry and Trade urged trade agencies to monitor and tighten controls around place of origin fraud to protect the reputation of Vietnamese goods.

Thailand's Department of Foreign Trade is taking over all approvals for Certificates of Origin (C/Os) for US-bound exports and has expanded a watchlist of high-risk products, local outlet Nation Thailand reported.

US authorities determine the underlying place of origin through a ""highly fact-specific analysis that needs to be done at a detailed level,"" said Mark Segrist, a partner at the import and export trade law firm Sandler, Travis & Rosenberg.

If US Customs and Border Protection begins to question legitimate country-of-origin shipments coming out of third countries based on fears that the goods may be Chinese, this could put shipments from those countries at risk of much higher scrutiny, Segrist told BI. 

That could lead to increased detentions, additional delays, and increased costs for US importers, he said.

Asian countries are also cracking down in an effort to prevent further sanctions, negotiate lower tariffs on their own imports, and secure trade deals with the US, both experts told BI.

Thailand and Vietnam have become manufacturing hot spots for many multinational companies diversifying their operations outside China. Heightened surveillance of illegal re-labelling would also help boost local manufacturers, Wen said.

Tesla is having a nightmare in Europe — and now it's been overtaken by two Chinese rivals in the UK.

The EV giant sold just 512 cars in Britain last month, down from more than 1,300 in April 2024 as the backlash against Elon Musk continues to hit sales in Europe.

Telsa's tally is well behind arch rival BYD, which sold 2,511 cars in the UK in April, or a 650% increase.

The disastrous performance meant it was also left in the dust by lesser-known Chinese brands Jaecoo and Omoda.

They are both owned by Chinese conglomerate Chery and sold 1,053 and 910 vehicles respectively in April, according to data from the SMMT trade body, despite only launching in the UK last year.

Jaecoo and Omoda offer a mix of EVs, hybrids, and gas-powered cars in the UK, unlike Tesla, which only sells EVs.

However, getting lapped by two virtually unknown Chinese rivals is a sign of just how much trouble Tesla faces in Europe, its third-biggest market.

Tesla shares fell 2.7% in morning trading on Tuesday, bringing the decline since the start of the year to 28%. 

The automaker is facing collapsing sales across the continent, with customers abandoning the company amid a backlash over CEO Musk's politics.

The billionaire's endorsement of the far-right German party AfD and position in the Trump administration has sparked protests in several European cities, with Tesla vehicles and showrooms also being hit by vandalism and suspected arson.

Tesla also faces renewed EV competition from legacy brands such as Volkswagen and Chinese automakers, which are expanding aggressively in Europe despite tariffs imposed by the European Union last year.

Tesla's European brand crisis shows little sign of abating.

Car registration figures in several European countries showed Tesla suffering double-digit declines in April. That means the launch of an updated version of the Model Y, Tesla's best-selling car, failed to halt the sales decline.

In the UK, Tesla has started offering up to two years of free supercharging for some Model Y models as it looks to arrest the slide.

There aren't a lot of people who can say they've beaten Apple. Tim Sweeney may have just earned a spot in that club.

Sweeney is the CEO of Epic Games — best known as the company behind Fortnite — and he won what may be a very meaningful court victory last week, by forcing a significant change in the way Apple runs its App Store.

Apple is going to appeal that ruling (and Sweeney is in a parallel fight with Google over its app store rules). But if the ruling stays put, it means the five years and the enormous amount of money Sweeney says he spent and sacrificed by challenging Apple and its CEO, Tim Cook, will have paid off.

Explaining why Apple's App Store rules are so important — to both Apple and the developers who complain about them — can be a drag, though I keep trying. I wanted to hear Sweeney's take on it directly because he's made the fight a core part of his job for half a decade.

And I also wanted to know when I'll be able to play Fortnite on my iPhone — something I haven't been able to do since 2020, when Sweeney first started fighting with Apple. (I've asked Apple for comment, but they haven't expanded on the statement they made last week expressing their disappointment and plans to appeal.)

You can hear our entire discussion over on my Channels podcast. The following is an edited excerpt of our conversation.

Peter Kafka: Why was last week's ruling important to you and Epic? And why should a normal person care about it?

Tim Sweeney: This is really one of the issues at the heart of our digital freedoms for the future. We live our lives on our smartphones. We're connected constantly to people. We work on them. We play on them. And our futures are going to be ever more connected there. So the freedom for consumers and developers to do business together is of paramount importance. If you have one monopoly gatekeeper who dictates what people are allowed to play, see, hear — and takes exorbitant fees from every transaction that everybody does online — we're going to have a much less free world than the one that we grew up in.

I started programming back on an Apple II when I was 13: You turn the computer on, you get a BASIC programming prompt. Anybody can write code, anybody can save it to a floppy disk, you can share it with a friend, you can sell it. Those digital freedoms are essential to the future.

I subscribe to Netflix. I subscribe to Spotify. Neither of those is done through Apple because in both cases, neither of those companies wanted to pay Apple's fees. But I use Spotify and Netflix on my phone.

I could maybe argue that it's a bit of a hassle for me to have to deal with Netflix on a website instead of directly through its iOS app. But it doesn't really seem like it's a sort of life and death situation for me or any of the companies involved.

Apple has two tiers of rules. They have one tier of rules for what they call reader apps, which are basically apps operated by multi-hundred-billion-dollar companies — Amazon Video, Netflix, Spotify, and a number of others. Apple lets those apps do business outside of the app. And they've previously obstructed those developers from telling users about the better deals [you could get by going to those sites directly].

But even with that restriction, which is now being taken away, it seemed like life was OK for me, life was OK for Netflix, life was OK for Apple. Everyone was getting what they wanted.

It was not OK for game developers. Because that reader app exception only applied to streaming video, streaming audio, and ebook sites. Apple forced all games, all social media apps, and everything else, to only do business through their app. So Apple imposed a rule on all game developers, saying if you sell anything for your game anywhere in the world on any platform, then you must sell it on iOS, and you must use our payment method, and you must pay us 30% if your revenue is greater than a million dollars. So the game developers did not have a choice, and everything there was just marked up 30%.

What happens given the ruling last week?

It means now all users are free to learn about better deals from all developers, and all developers are free to not just accept payments outside of the app on the web, but to tell users about those alternative ways to pay and to give consumers better deals. That's a key economic gain here.

Now developers will be able to send users to the web to give them a better price, and then to make a little bit more money for themselves, too.

But that's just the first-order effect. The second-order effect is that you can expect if Apple continues to offer such a horrible deal, that everybody's going to move away and steer their customers towards iOS payments on the web. So I would hope that Apple would step up and compete, give developers a much better deal than 30%, and actually engage in competition. But whether Apple chooses to compete or not, the court has enabled developers to make the choice for themselves.

Apple says they're going to comply with the judge's ruling, but they're also going to appeal it. So it's possible the rules get changed again. Do you think a meaningful number of developers are willing to take advantage of this window, knowing that it can get shut down?

It's 30% of revenue, so all major developers will support alternative payments. Spotify was the first major app I saw that already has done it. Fortnite will do it later this week. And many, many apps are doing it.

You said Fortnite is going to come back to iOS. You guys were kicked off the platform in 2020 for violating Apple's rules. There's nothing in the judge's ruling that says Apple has to reinstate Fortnite on iOS. Have you talked to Apple? How do you imagine Fortnite will come back to iOS?

Epic has a valid [Apple] developer account in good standing. Our subsidiary Epic Games Sweden opened up an account in order to distribute Fortnite in the European Union.

Our dealings with Apple on that account have been managed by their developer relations team, who have been cordial.

Do you feel confident that I will be able to play Fortnite on my iPhone later this week?

I believe so. I would be very surprised — well, I wouldn't be terribly surprised if we had a bug that took a day or two more to fix — but I would be very surprised if Apple decided to brave the geopolitical storm of blocking a major app from iOS.

We've told Apple what we're doing.

How much has it cost you to engage in this five-year legal fight?

We've had legal bills in the matter of Epic vs. Apple of over $100 million.

I assumed it was much more. You were hiring top-shelf lawyers and …

Well, yeah. Well over $100 million, just in legal fees.

But if you look at lost revenue, that's another story. We can't predict exactly how much we would have made on iOS, but in the two years that we were on the platform, Fortnite had made about $300 million on iOS. So you could have projected hundreds of millions of dollars of lost revenue as a result of the fight.

And that's just from people who were playing and couldn't play. I'm thinking of the future players you would have gotten, who didn't get exposed to the game because they don't have access to it via their phone. Roblox has tons of young players. The majority there are teenagers or below. They're all getting to it via their phone. Those are all people who could have played Fortnite for the last five years.

That's right. Metcalfe's Law is a real factor here. You're much more likely to play a game or use a social network if your friends are there. So Apple cutting off Epic from access to the entire iOS audience, that not only affects the players that are directly denied access to Fortnite, it also affects all of their friends who might have played Fortnite more or might have played Fortnite but didn't, because their friends weren't able to play.

So you could easily imagine that there's been a billion dollars or more of impact to Epic in this time.

I think freedom cannot be purchased at too dear a price. The world needs to change here. And if it doesn't change, then you're just going to have Apple and Google extracting all of the profit from all apps forever. And there will be no proper digital economy. It will just be monopolization.

I understand the logic and emotion behind that argument. On the other hand: You're running a for-profit company. You have a lot of investors. They put a lot of money into you. Did they come to you at any point in the last five years and say, ""Tim, I know that freedom cannot be purchased at too dear a price. On the other hand, I've invested a lot of money in you because you're a games company, and your game is banned from mobile phones. Could you just settle this up and declare victory and move on?""

Other than one investor who exited Epic right quick, everybody has stood by us, because nobody invested in Epic because they want to make a 30% profit flipping the stock.

They have invested in [us], believe in our vision, believe in our potential, and believe that if we succeed in building the metaverse and growing Fortnite from a game into an ecosystem, into an open platform serving literally billions of players, that it will totally have been worth it. They all realize that if Apple controls the spigot, the revenue spigot at the top of the funnel, they will use that control to extract all of the profit that will ever be made from this space.

Do you imagine this is the rest of your professional life — running a business, coding, and then also having legal fights with platforms?

There's a game and a meta game here, right? The game is making awesome software, which is awesomely fun, creatively and technically. I love that. But there's a meta game of ensuring that we have the right to do that, and that we can profit from the fruits of our labor, and that all developers can. So much of our business is not just Epic profiting from our games. It's Epic helping other developers succeed and profiting from the success of thousands or hundreds of thousands of different developers themselves.

Epic is one of the few companies in the industry that's positioned in a way that really forces us to fight for everybody. And I don't feel bad about this. I put a lot of brain power into coding over the years. I put a lot of brain power into figuring out how to defeat the monopolies that are blocking us.

What good is coding if you don't have the right to release your product? You have to mix the love of the art together with your defense of your right to engage in the art.

Germany's Election:

Friedrich Merz secured parliamentary backing as Germany's new chancellor only on the second attempt, paving the way for the conservative leader to take charge of Europe's biggest economy but with considerably diminished authority.

In a repeat Bundestag ballot on Tuesday in Berlin, Merz got 325 votes, more than the required 316 out of 630 lawmakers. He had earlier managed only 310 in an initial tally that was meant to rubber stamp him as the head of an alliance of his center-right CDU/CSU bloc and the center-left Social Democrats, even though the coalition partners have 328 seats between them.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

A key Republican senator on Tuesday said he would not support the controversial nomination of Ed Martin, President Donald Trump's pick to be the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, dealing a potentially fatal blow to Martin's chances of winning Senate confirmation.

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said, ""I've indicated to the White House I wouldn't support his nomination.""

Tillis cited Martin's support for criminal defendants in Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot cases.

That riot began after Trump urged a crowd of his supporters to march to the Capitol that day and oppose the confirmation of Joe Biden's election as president.

The Jan. 6 cases were prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office in D.C. before Trump issued blanket pardons to defendants in the cases on his first day back in the White House in January.

Tillis' decision is likely to doom Martin's hope of his nomination even being reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which Tillis is a member.

With Tillis as a ""no"" vote, the best that Martin could hope for from that committee is a tie vote of 11-11, with Republicans and Democrats evenly split. A tie vote would fail to report Martin out of the committee and onward to a confirmation vote in the full Senate.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, on Monday night did not add Martin's nomination to the panel's business meeting agenda, which signaled his chance of being approved was in peril.

""I want to put people on the agenda that I can help the president be successful in his nominees and that's all I can say at this point,"" Grassley told reporters Tuesday.

""I want the president's nominees to be successful, and that means we put on people that have the votes."" Grassley said.

Martin currently is serving as interim U.S. attorney for D.C., but his term will expire on May 20.

Tillis told reporters that he met with Martin on Monday evening and that it went well.

""But let me be very clear,"" Tillis said,

""Mr. Martin did a good job of explaining the one area that I think he's probably right, that there were some people that were over-prosecuted, but there were some [200 to 300 of them] that should have never gotten a pardon,"" Tillis said.

""If Mr. Martin were being put forth as a U.S. attorney for any district except the district where Jan. 6 happened, the protest happened, I'd probably support him, but not in this district.""

Tillis said that he believed that any member of the crowd on Jan. 6 outside the Capitol who breached the perimeter should have been in prison for some period of time.

""Whether it's 30 days or three years is debatable, but I have no tolerance for anybody who entered the building on January the sixth, and that's probably where most of the friction was,"" he said.

Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones said Tuesday that stocks are bound to hit new lows even if President Donald Trump tones down his aggressive tariffs on China.

""For me, it's pretty clear. You have Trump who's locked in on tariffs. You have the Fed who's locked in on not cutting rates. That's not good for the stock market,"" Jones said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""We'll probably go down to new lows, even when Trump dials back China to 50%.""

The widely followed investor's bearish comments came after Trump's rollout of the highest levies on imports in generations shocked the world last month, triggering extreme volatility on Wall Street. The S&P 500 suffered a severe sell-off but has since recouped much of the losses, sitting 8% below its all-time high.

Trump has slapped tariffs of 145% on imported Chinese goods this year, prompting China to impose retaliatory levies of 125%. China said last week it is evaluating the possibility of starting trade negotiations with the U.S.

""He'll dial it back to 50% or 40%, whatever. Even when he does that ... it'd be the largest tax increases since the '60s,"" Jones said. ""So you can kind of take 2%, 3% off growth.""

Jones, founder and chief investment officer of Tudor Investment, believes stocks haven't found a bottom as macroeconomic conditions continue to deteriorate. The Federal Reserve has held its key overnight lending rate steady since December in a range between 4.25% and 4.5%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said he expects policymakers to ""wait for greater clarity"" on trade policy ramifications before adjusting any further.

""Unless they got really dovish and really, really cut, you're probably going to go to new lows,"" Jones said. ""And then when we're new lows, the hard day will start to follow, and it'll probably create the Fed to move, create Trump to move. And then we'll get some kind of reality.""

Jones shot to fame after he predicted and profited from the 1987 stock market crash. He is also the chairman of nonprofit Just Capital, which ranks public U.S. companies based on social and environmental metrics.

One of the goals of President Donald Trump's 145% tariffs against China is to drive manufacturing back to America. But the odds of that are low, at least when it comes to toys.

""We don't see that happening,"" Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday, less than a day after the company withdrew annual financial targets.

""We need to remember that a significant part of toy creation happens in America,"" he said. ""Design, development, product engineering, brand management all happens in America. Making product, producing product in other countries, allows us to create quality products at affordable price points.""

Mattel has been diversifying its global manufacturing for nearly a decade in an effort to reduce its dependence on China. By the end of the year, less than 40% of Mattel's product will be sourced from the country. Kreiz noted that in two years, no country will represent more than 25% of Mattel's sourcing.

In the meantime, Mattel is taking mitigating actions to fully offset costs associated with Trump's trade war with China, including raising prices in the U.S., while aiming to keep the cost of many toys low.

The company is expecting to keep between 40% and 50% of its products under $20, according to Roth analyst Eric Handler.

""This is something we are committed to do,"" Kreiz said. ""To continue to create quality product and find the right balance of price and value all in the service of the consumer.""

Since the tariffs were announced on April 2, Mattel's stock is down about 19%.

Uber will acquire an 85% stake in Turkish food delivery platform Trendyol GO for about $700 million in cash, the company said in a securities filing.

The deal, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in the second half of this year. Uber said it expects the transaction to be accretive to its growth once completed.

""Uber and Trendyol GO coming together will elevate the delivery sector in Türkiye for consumers, couriers, restaurants and retailers, especially small and family-owned businesses,"" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a release. ""This deal reflects our long-term commitment to Türkiye, we're incredibly impressed with what the Trendyol GO team has built, and we're excited to continue that strong momentum across the country.""

Founded in 2010, Trendyol GO is run by Turkish e-commerce platform Trendyol, which is majority owned by Chinese titan Alibaba. The platform hosts roughly 90,000 restaurants and 19,000 couriers across the country.

In 2024, Trendyol GO delivered more than 200 million orders and generated $2 billion in gross bookings, a jump of 50% year over year, Uber said in the securities filing.

The announcement comes as Uber is set to report first-quarter earnings before market open on Wednesday. The ride-share and food delivery company is expected to post earnings per share of 51 cents on revenue of $11.6 billion, according to StreetAccount.

In this article

Hispanic consumers are cutting back their grocery spending on everything from beer to cooking spray, executives said during recent earnings calls.

Coca-Cola, Constellation Brands and Colgate-Palmolive are among the companies that have reported a slowdown in North American sales from Hispanic shoppers.

A fifth of the U.S. population identifies as Hispanic or Latino, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Hispanics are now the second-largest demographic in the U.S. and the second-fastest growing ethnic group, agency data shows.

As the population of Hispanic consumers grows, so does their purchasing power — and their contribution to companies' bottom lines. According to the latest data from economic think tank Latino Donor Collaborative, the U.S. Latino economy grew to $3.6 trillion in 2022, up from $3.2 trillion the prior year. And when it comes to shopping, Hispanic Americans overall spend more on consumer packaged goods and outpace non-Hispanic consumers, according to market research firm Circana.

But the White House's hard-line immigration stance and broader economic concerns have led some Hispanic consumers to pull back their spending.

Hispanic consumers drove a sharp decline in consumer net purchase intent in January, although the trend moderated in February, according to a research note from Goldman Sachs, citing HundredX data. The metric refers to the ratio of customers who intend to buy more from a brand subtracted from those who plan to buy less.

A contributing factor to the dip, some experts say, is fear around stricter immigration policy.

While the Trump administration has deported fewer people than President Joe Biden's administration during the year-ago period, reports from Immigration and Customs Enforcement show it is holding 10% more detainees than it was under Biden.

Hispanic consumers helped Constellation Brands' Modelo Especial overtake Bud Light as the nation's top-selling beer. More than 50% of Modelo drinkers are Hispanic, according to CEO Bill Newlands.

But Constellation provided a weaker-than-expected outlook for its fiscal 2026, citing both tariffs and diminished spending from Hispanic consumers.

""The fact is, a lot of consumers in the Hispanic community are concerned right now. … Over half are concerned relative to immigration issues and how those impact [them]. A number of them are concerned about job losses in industries that have a high Latino employment base,"" Newlands said on the company's conference call in early April.

The Latino unemployment rate ticked up to a seasonally adjusted 5.2% in April, from 4.8% a year earlier and 5.1% in March, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

""Things like social gatherings, an area where the Hispanic consumer often consumes beer, are declining today,"" Newlands added.

Constellation, which also owns Corona, has repeatedly self-reported that Hispanic Americans make up roughly half of the company's overall beer business. Hispanic- and Latino-identifying customers accounted for 32.5% of Constellation Brands' sales in 2023, according to data from consumer research firm Numerator and investment bank Jefferies.

And Constellation isn't the only brewer seeing a downturn. Sam Adams' owner Boston Beer referred to a similar decline in its quarterly report.

""The macroeconomic winds are obviously the consumer confidence, the fear of inflation; there is also some pullback from the Hispanic consumers that they're just not going out as much,"" said Boston Beer CEO Michael Spillane.

Hispanic consumers are also pulling back on their non-alcoholic beverage purchases.

Spending by Hispanic consumers has softened over the last couple of months, Keurig Dr Pepper CEO Tim Cofer said on the company's conference call in late April.

""When you dig into that, you see that manifesting both in terms of fewer trips and lower spend per trip,"" he told analysts.

Hispanic consumers make up ""a meaningful percentage"" of Keurig Dr Pepper's business and broader consumer packaged goods category, according to Cofer. The company owns brands popular with Hispanic consumers like Squirt soda, Peñafiel mineral water and Clamato, which can be mixed with beer to make micheladas.

Still, the slowdown was not enough to cause Keurig Dr Pepper to lower its full-year outlook.

Rival Coca-Cola also didn't trim its forecast, but it is prioritizing winning back Hispanic consumers next quarter.

For years, the company has targeted Latinos through advertising and acquisitions, like the 2017 purchase of Mexico's Topo Chico. Mexico is also a top market for its namesake beverage. But this quarter, executives said weaker traffic from Hispanic shoppers weighed on its North American volume, fueled in part by a boycott.

In February, rumors spread on social media that Coke had reported undocumented workers to U.S. immigration authorities. Coke denied the accusations, but CEO James Quincey said last week that the ""completely false"" videos hurt traffic, particularly in Southern states.

And Coke is seeing additional fallout south of the border from the tensions around the Trump administration's policies.

""Some of the geopolitical tension and Hispanic pullback also affected the Mexican [market], particularly the border region, which is very connected to the U.S.,"" Quincey told analysts on the company's conference call.

The pullback from Hispanic consumers didn't just hit the beverage aisle. Other parts of the grocery store are feeling the heat, too.

Associated British Foods saw the pullback hit U.S. sales of its Mazola cooking oils, which is the country's top-selling oil brand.

""It's a bit miserable at the moment because our key customer is Hispanic and is feeling nervous and fearful, and they're cutting back on expenditure. It feels really recessionary in parts of the U.S. market,"" CEO George Weston said on the company's conference call on Thursday.

Colgate-Palmolive also saw lower traffic from Hispanic consumers all across the business, the company's chief investor relations officer, John Faucher, said at the UBS Global Consumer and Retail Conference in March. The company on April 25 reported a 2.3% decline in North American volume for the first quarter.

Still, Walmart, the nation's largest grocer, said the Trump's administration's immigration policy hasn't resulted in anything worth sharing yet.

""It's a nonevent for us so far,"" CEO Doug McMillon said on the company's earnings call in mid-February.

Friedrich Merz failed to be elected German chancellor Tuesday, after he fell short of securing a majority in a shock first-round parliamentary vote.

Update: Germany's Merz elected chancellor in second parliamentary vote after unexpected setback

Merz needed at least 316 votes to become chancellor and only 310 members of parliament voted in his favor. Germany's Bundestag has a total of 630 members.

The result marks an unanticipated setback for Merz who was widely expected to secure the necessary votes and be officially sworn in later in the day.

After the result of the vote was announced the parliamentary session was halted to allow for discussion of next steps. The German Dax stock market index extended losses to trade around 1.4% lower by 10:07 a.m. London time.

A second vote needs to take place within 14 days, according to the German constitution, with an absolute majority needed once again. There are also protocols in place in case the second vote also fails to elect a chancellor.

Merz' Social Democratic Union, alongside its sister party the Christian Social Union, won the biggest share of votes in Germany's February election. They were due to form a coalition government with the Social Democratic Party. Coalition governments are commonplace in Germany where it is very rare for a party to secure an absolute majority of over 50% in an election.

The parties on Monday signed their coalition agreement, titled ""Responsibility for Germany,"" following weeks of negotiations that began soon after Germany's February election. 

Despite the setback, Merz is still expected to eventually be elected chancellor, economists and analysts said Tuesday.

""Friedrich Merz became the first chancellor candidate failing to be elected in the first round of voting in the Bundestag. However, he remains likely to win sufficient support eventually,"" Carsten Nickel, deputy director of research at Teneo, said.

Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, described the situation as a ""bad surprise."" He echoed comments suggesting Merz would still become chancellor eventually, but ""the unprecedented failure to be elected in the first round would still be a bad start for him.""

""It shows that he cannot fully rely on his two coalition parties. That will sow some doubts about his ability to fully pursue his agenda, damaging his domestic and international authority at least initially,"" Schmieding said.

The 69-year-old Merz has long been shooting for the top job in German politics. He joined the CDU when he was still in school, eventually leading the local branch of the party's youth organization. In 1989 he became a member of the European Parliament, before later joining Germany's Bundestag.

Much of Merz's political career in the early 2000s was marked by a rivalry with former German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the two competed for leadership roles in the CDU itself and within the CDU-CSU parliamentary group. Merz became chair, then deputy head, of the latter before eventually resigning from the role in 2004 — observers at the time linked this to Merkel rising through the ranks.

Before his time in politics, Merz studied law, initially working as a judge, then as a lawyer at Mayer Brown LLP. He has also held senior positions at companies including BlackRock Germany and HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt.

Hugo Boss on Tuesday pointed to deteriorating U.S. consumer confidence, with uncertainty around tariffs, recession risks and immigration policy dampening both domestic and tourist spend in its largest single market.

CEO Daniel Grieder said U.S. shopper appetite had ""certainly diminished"" but that it was too soon to judge the real impact of U.S. policies after sales in the country declined 1% annually in the first quarter.

""We continue to monitor the situation,"" Grieder said an earnings call. ""Given the ongoing uncertainty around tariffs, it's still too early to draw final conclusions.""

The U.S. is Hugo Boss' largest retail market and a recent growth driver for the firm, accounting for approximately 15% of group revenues. However, it has no domestic U.S. manufacturing presence, with 40% of group exports to the country deriving from Europe and around 4% coming from China, according to the company.

Grieder said Hugo Boss' exposure to U.S. tariffs was currently ""well contained"" but that it was pursuing several strategic steps to navigate the potential fallout.

Such measures include redirecting products coming from China to the U.S. and replacing them with products from other markets, optimizing the company's global sourcing footprint and ""evaluating demand-sensitive price adjustments.""

It comes as the high-end German retailer on Tuesday posted slightly better-than-feared first quarter sales and reiterated its full-year guidance despite macroeconomic and tariff uncertainty.

The high-end retailer said revenues fell 2% on a currency adjusted basis over the three month period to 999 million euros ($1.13 billion), slightly ahead of the 979 million euros forecast by analysts in an LSEG poll.

It also confirmed its 2025 outlook, forecasting full-year sales to be in line with last year's at between 4.2 billion euros and 4.4 billion euros.

Shares rose as much as 8.8% on the news, with the stock last seen trading up 5.13% at around 12:39 p.m. London time.

Weaker sales continued to be led by Asia Pacific, down 8%, and specifically ""ongoing subdued consumer demand in China"" — a continued weak spot for the group. Europe sales were also down 1%.

""Following a strong finish to 2024, our performance in the first quarter of 2025 was affected by the rising macroeconomic uncertainty, which impacted global consumer sentiment and our industry,"" Grieder said in a statement.

The company added that it is continuing to monitor the economic outlook, after Grieder noted in March that global trade tensions had had a visible impact on first-quarter demand.

""We are closely monitoring macroeconomic developments and remain vigilant in light of the elevated uncertainties, including the current tariff discussions,"" he said.

Consumer goods companies have been assessing the potentially disruptive impact of U.S. tariffs on global supply chains and consumer confidence, with several firms flagging the likelihood of forthcoming price hikes.

In a note Tuesday, Citi analysts wrote that any ""major change in the external political or economic environment"" that directly or indirectly affects consumer confidence would pose a ""risk"" to Hugo Boss' sales performance.

Hugo Boss has been pushing ahead with its strategic overhaul agenda in recent years as it seeks to revive waning consumer demand, which Grieder said had contributed to its slightly improved first quarter performance.

Yanmei Tang, analyst at Third Bridge, said the group had successfully expanded its appeal beyond formal wear, pointing to improvements in store formats, product diversification and engagement with younger consumers.

""However, areas like womenswear remain a weak spot, with no standout products or a clear strategy emerging,"" she wrote in a note, adding that acquisition of an established female fashion brand could help accelerate the group's growth agenda.

In this article

The closure of a trade loophole and prohibitive tariffs on China have upended Temu and Shein's business model in the United States. And yet the e-commerce companies are likely to remain a dominant force in American online retailing, experts suggest.  

On Friday, the de minimis rule — a policy that had exempted U.S. imports worth $800 from trade tariffs — officially closed for shipments from China. This has seen Temu and Shein exposed to duties as high as 120% or a flat fee of $100, set to rise to $200 in June.

The small-package tariff exemption had been key to the companies' ability to maintain budget prices on the merchandise they shipped from China. In the lead-up to its removal, prices of goods shipped directly from China on Temu and Shein surged, with Temu later ending direct shipments from outside the U.S. altogether. 

The change will be welcomed by many detractors of de minimis, among them U.S. lawmakers, labor unions and retailers, who have argued that Temu and Shein abused the exemption to undercut local businesses and flood the country with illicit and counterfeit products. 

But despite the new trade challenges that Temu and Shein face, e-commerce and supply chain experts told CNBC that the companies are still capable of competing with their rivals in the U.S. 

""Don't count them out ... Not at all. These kinds of Chinese e-commerce apps are very adept and agile. They have contingency plans in place and have taken the necessary steps to cover the tariffs from a margin perspective,"" said Deborah Weinswig, CEO and founder of Coresight Research.

""I personally believe, if anything, [America's e-commerce] game has been accelerating in favor of Temu and Shein ... I wouldn't be surprised if the competitiveness gap actually continues to widen,"" added Weinswig, whose research and advisory firm works with clients across tech, retail and supply chains.

The loss of the de minimis exemption had long been anticipated, with U.S. President Donald Trump temporarily closing it in February. In preparation, Temu and Shein had been accelerating localization strategies for the U.S.

Scott Miller, CEO of e-commerce consulting firm pdPlus, told CNBC that Shein and Temu will continue to onboard goods from American sellers onto their apps to protect them from tariffs. 

""Many of the current sellers on Temu and Shein are located in China or countries nearby, but not all. Local U.S. companies have been joining these platforms at an accelerating pace ... several of our clients have onboarded or began the process of onboarding in just the past few months,"" he said. 

While margins for more localized brands and sellers will be lower on the platforms than those shipping directly from China, they can be competitive, according to Miller.

He added that in the case of Temu, vendors are attracted to lower fees, lighter competition and greater assistance with onboarding and setting up sales channels compared with what Amazon offers. 

In recent days, Temu, which is owned by Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings, has begun exclusively offering goods shipped from local warehouses to U.S. shoppers.

Many of those goods are still sourced from China but then shipped in bulk to U.S. warehouses, according to experts. While these bulk items are subject to tariffs, they also benefit from economies of scale. 

This development is likely to see the variety of products on Temu scaled back, said Henry Jin, an associate professor of supply chain management at Miami University. However, he added, Temu is likely to resume direct shipments from China, depending on the outcome of the trade war between Washington and Beijing. 

Shein, meanwhile, has leaned into supply chain expansion, building manufacturing operations in countries such as Turkey, Mexico and Brazil, and reportedly plans to shift to Vietnam.

The company appears to still be shipping directly from China and likely has more room to absorb tariffs because of its ""sky-high"" margins in its core fast-fashion business, Jin said.

""If there's one thing that Chinese companies are good at, it's operating on a razor thin margin in an intensely competitive, if not adverse environment ... they find every scrap that they can to survive,"" he added.

Contingency plans aside, experts said that Trump's trade policy will likely continue to fuel higher prices for goods on Temu and Shein's apps.

Prices across different shopping categories on Shein rose between 5% and 50% in the latter half of April, with the sharpest rises seen in toys and games and beauty and health, according to data from Coresight. 

Regardless, many e-commerce experts remain confident that Temu and Shein will continue to prove price-competitive. 

Temu, which had increased prices of orders shipped directly from China, told CNBC on Tuesday that ""pricing for U.S. consumers remains unchanged as the platform transitions to a local fulfillment model."" 

Coresight's Weinswig said the two companies have previously been able to offer products at a third of the prices on Amazon for comparable goods. So, even if they more than double the prices to absorb the impacts of tariffs, many goods could remain cheaper than those on American e-commerce sites and retailers. 

Jason Wong, who works in product logistics for Temu in Hong Kong, noted this dynamic when speaking to CNBC last month, likening Temu to a dollar store. If prices at the dollar store go from $1 to $2, it's still a dollar store, he said. 

Furthermore, Trump's trade tariffs on China and other trade partners have also affected American retailers and e-commerce sites like Amazon. 

When Forever 21 filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year, it blamed Shein and Temu's use of the de minimis exemption, which it said ""undercut"" its business. 

But experts say that exclusively attributing the success of Shein and Temu to that trade loophole misses many of the other factors that have made them smash hits in the U.S.

According to Anand Kumar, associate director of research at Coresight Research, Temu and Shein owe a lot of their success to their very agile supply chains that adapt fast to consumer trends. 

For example, Shein's small-batch production — in which product styles are initially launched in limited quantities, typically around 100-200 items — allows it to test and scale products efficiently. 

Another key is the companies' applications, which use various strategies to maintain user interest, including frequent phone notifications, product recommendation algorithms and perhaps most notably, constantly displaying discounted prices from promotions and flash sales. 

Temu was offering a ""mega savings extravaganza"" for American consumers on Monday. Some of the bestselling items on sale included stainless steel hook earrings for $1.45 and a fitted mattress pad for $11.54. It's unclear if the discounted local goods were stockpiled before tariffs came into effect. 

In addition, app users will often be met with mini-games that grant different coupons or ways to earn rewards, as well as opportunities to buy ""mystery boxes"" with assorted products.

That ""gamification strategy"" definitely plays into the consumer psychology of many U.S. shoppers who often buy items out of the excitement of being able to get a great deal, said Miami University's Jin. 

Experts also flagged that Temu and Shein have been very effective at marketing, including through the harnessing of livestreaming and social media. 

On the other hand, according to Coresights' Weinswig, American retailers have failed to adequately recognize threats from Temu and Shein and adjust their supply chains and pricing models.

Out of all the tariff actions U.S. President Donald Trump has announced, the 100% levy on movies produced outside the U.S. ranks as one of the most bizarre, taking its place beside the head-scratching formula his administration used to determine the level of tariffs.

Trump didn't share details of how the tariff would work — or if it would actually be implemented — but the mere announcement of the levy was enough to bring down shares of entertainment and media companies like Netflix and Paramount.

Costs aside, how would those tariffs work on a cultural level? Would the Oscars remove its category for Best Foreign Film? Must all movies be set in the U.S. as well? Will American actors starring in international films be penalized?

Those may seem outlandish concerns, but predicting the next act of the U.S. president is near impossible — Trump is a cliffhanger embodied. Given that the presidential term seems to almost be a reality television series for Trump, his actions might be good for viewership but a rotten tomato for everyone else.

S&P 500 breaks winning streakU.S. markets fell Monday. The S&P 500 lost 0.64%, snapping a nine-day rally, its longest since 2004. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.24% and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.74%. U.S. crude oil futures fell about 2% Monday to its lowest settlement since February 2021 after OPEC+ agreed to hike production. Asia-Pacific stocks most rose Tuesday. India's Nifty 50 dipped roughly 0.4% in early trade amid reports that the country has proposed to the U.S. it will remove tariffs on steel, auto components and pharmaceuticals on a reciprocal basis.

The end of an era for BuffettBerkshire Hathaway shares fell 4.9% Monday after Warren Buffett proposed Saturday for Greg Abel to replace him as CEO by the end of the year. The company's board voted unanimously Sunday to make Abel president and CEO on Jan. 1, 2026, and for Buffett to remain as chairman. Shares of the company have rocketed 5,502,284% between 1965, when Buffett took over Berkshire Hathaway, and the end of 2024.

More tariff developments from TrumpTrump announced Sunday that he would be imposing a 100% tariff on films produced outside the United States, but walked back on his comments the next day. On Sunday, Trump also downplayed the threat of supply shortages by saying girls ""could be very happy"" with fewer dolls. Finally, Trump signed an executive order Monday to reduce the amount of time it takes to approve pharmaceutical manufacturing plants in the America, and added he will announce pharmaceutical-specific tariffs within the next two weeks.

Palantir hikes outlook but shares fallPalantir shares tumbled more than 9% in extended trading after it reported earnings that met expectations. The company, which provides artificial intelligence software for governments and corporations, also hiked its full-year revenue outlook to between $3.89 billion and $3.90 billion. Palantir shares have defied 2025′s broad downtrend in technology stocks. Even after today's fall, the stock is up 64% this year.

Ford suspends its guidanceFord Motor beat Wall Street's first-quarter expectations, but suspended its 2025 financial guidance amid an expected $2.5 billion impact this year from Trump's tariffs. The Detroit automaker said it expects to offset $1 billion of those costs through remediation actions as well as volume and pricing expectations for a total impact of $1.5 billion in 2025. Shares fell around 2.5% in extended trading.

[PRO] Chinese ETF over U.S. tech? Chinese technology stocks have seen a volatile start to 2025, with substantial short-term swings in both directions. But the choppy price action year to date is within a constructive long-term context. This Chinese tech ETF could be a better bet than U.S. technology stocks, which appear relatively overextended, wrote Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies.

Temu and Shein face massive tariffs. But don't count them out of the U.S. e-tail scene, experts say

On Friday, the de minimis rule — a policy that had exempted U.S. imports worth $800 from trade tariffs — officially closed for shipments from China. This has seen Temu and Shein exposed to duties as high as 120% or a flat fee of $100, set to rise to $200 in June.

The small-package tariff exemption had been key to the companies' ability to maintain budget prices on the merchandise they ship from China. Now that it's gone, prices on Temu and Shein have been surging, with the former ending direct shipments from outside the U.S. altogether. 

Despite the new trade challenges that Temu and Shein face, e-commerce and supply chain experts told CNBC that the companies are still capable of competing with their rivals in the U.S.

LONDON — British food delivery firm Deliveroo on Tuesday said it has agreed to a takeover offer from American rival DoorDash that values the company at £2.9 billion ($3.9 billion).

Deliveroo, which lets users order hot meals and groceries via an app, said its board agreed to an offer from DoorDash to acquire all issued and to be issued shares in the company for 180 pence a share.

That marks a 44% premium to Deliveroo's closing price on April 4, the last business day prior to DoorDash's initial offer letter. Deliveroo shares jumped to a three-year high last week after the company confirmed it had received a takeover offer from DoorDash.

The transaction values Deliveroo at £2.9 billion on a fully diluted basis, the company said. Shares of Deliveroo climbed nearly 2% on Monday following news of the deal.

DoorDash said that the financial terms of the acquisition were final and would not be increased unless a third party steps in with a rival bid.

""I could not be more excited by the prospect of what DoorDash and Deliveroo will be able to accomplish together. We'll cover more than 40 countries with a combined population of more than 1 billion people, enabling us to provide more local businesses with the tools and technology they need to thrive,"" said Tony Xu, CEO and Co-founder of DoorDash.

The acquisition deal marks an end to Deliveroo's tumultuous ride as a public company.

Once viewed as a British tech darling, Deliveroo saw its shares tank 30% in 2021 in one of the worst trading debuts on the London Stock Exchange. Shares have continued to fall from that point and are down more than 50% from the firm's £3.90 IPO price.

Deliveroo went public at a time when the U.K. was still feeling the impacts of Covid-19 lockdowns, which had boosted the fortunes of various food delivery platforms. Investors questioned the sustainability of that growth in a post-Covid world, and saw intense competition in the market and legal challenges to the gig economy model as key risks for Deliveroo.

For DoorDash, acquiring Deliveroo marks a renewed effort from the American online takeout app to expand its presence overseas. DoorDash acquired Finnish food delivery app Wolt for 7 billion euros ($7.9 billion) in 2022.

Shares of DoorDash dipped about 1% in U.S. pre-market trading.

More broadly, the food delivery sector has been undergoing consolidation for several years now. Earlier this year, Deliveroo sold parts of its Hong Kong unit to Delivery Hero, while Just East agreed to be acquired by investment group Prosus.

Disputed ballots in the still unresolved 2024 race for a North Carolina Supreme Court seat must remain in the final count, a federal judge ruled late Monday, a decision that if upheld would result in an electoral victory for Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs.

U.S. District Judge Richard Myers agreed with Riggs and others who argued it would be a violation of the U.S. Constitution to carry out recent decisions by state appeals courts that directed the removal of potentially thousands of voter ballots deemed ineligible. Myers wrote that votes couldn't be removed six months after Election Day without damaging due process and equal protection rights of the affected residents.

Myers also ordered the State Board of Elections to certify results that after two recounts showed Riggs the winner — by just 734 votes — over Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin. But the judge delayed his decision for seven days in case Griffin wants to appeal the ruling to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

The board ""must not proceed with implementation of the North Carolina Court of Appeals and Supreme Court's orders, and instead must certify the results of the election for (the seat) based on the tally at the completion of the canvassing period,"" wrote Myers, who was nominated to the bench by President Donald Trump.

More than 5.5 million ballots were cast in what has been the nation's last undecided race from November's general election. Griffin filed formal protests after the election in hopes that removing ballots he said were unlawfully cast would flip the outcome to him.

Griffin's legal team was reviewing Myers' order Monday night and evaluating the next steps, Griffin campaign spokesperson Paul Shumaker wrote in an email.

Riggs was more assured in her statement: ""Today, we won. I'm proud to continue upholding the Constitution and the rule of law as North Carolina's Supreme Court Justice.""

Griffin wanted Myers to leave undisturbed the state courts' decisions, which also directed that most of the voters with otherwise ineligible ballots get 30 days to provide identifying information for their race choices to remain in the tally.

Riggs, the state Democratic Party and some affected voters said Griffin was trying to change the 2024 election outcome after the fact by removing ballots cast by voters who complied with voting rules as they were written last fall.

Myers wrote that Griffin's formal protests after the election, which were rejected by the State Board of Elections, constituted efforts to make retroactive changes to the voting laws that would arbitrarily disenfranchise only the voters who were targeted by Griffin. Griffin's challenges over photo ID only covered at most six Democratic-leaning counties in the state.

""You establish the rules before the game. You don't change them after the game is done,"" Myers wrote in a 68-page order.

""Permitting parties to 'upend the set rules' of an election after the election has taken place can only produce 'confusion and turmoil'"" that ""'threatens to undermine public confidence in the federal courts, state agencies, and the elections themselves,'"" he added while citing other cases.

Democrats and voting rights groups raised alarm about Griffin's efforts. They called it an attack on democracy that would serve as a road map for the GOP to reverse future election results in other states. The state Republican Party said Griffin was seeking to ensure that only legal votes are counted.

The U.S. Department of Education informed Harvard University on Monday that it was freezing billions of dollars in future research grants and other aid until the nation's oldest and wealthiest college concedes to a number of demands from the Trump administration, a senior department official said.

The move represents the latest salvo from a Trump administration willing to use the power of the federal purse to force institutions, from law firms to universities, to make sweeping policy changes or lose billions of dollars in federal grants and contracts.

In a letter to Harvard, U.S. Education Department Secretary Linda McMahon said the university must address concerns about antisemitism on campus, school policies that consider a student's race, and complaints from the administration that the university has abandoned its pursuit of ""academic excellence"" while employing relatively few conservative faculty members.

""This letter is to inform you that Harvard should no longer seek GRANTS from the federal government, since none will be provided,"" McMahon wrote.

Harvard said the McMahon letter doubles down on demands that would impose ""unprecedented and improper control"" over the university and makes new threats to ""illegally"" withhold funding for lifesaving research.

""Harvard will also continue to defend against illegal government overreach aimed at stifling research and innovation that make Americans safer and more secure,"" a university spokesperson said.

The freeze of future funding represents a slightly altered tactic by the Trump administration, whose attempts to freeze top schools of existing funds raised legal eyebrows.

Trump has targeted Harvard over allegations of antisemitism on campus during pro-Palestinian protests. The protests were sparked by U.S. ally Israel's military assault on Gaza after the October 2023 attack on Israel by Palestinian Hamas militants.

Trump has alleged that pro-Palestinian protesters are antisemitic and sympathetic to Hamas. Protesters, including some Jewish groups, say the government wrongly conflated their criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza with antisemitism and their advocacy for Palestinian rights with support for extremism.

In recent weeks, the administration began a formal review into nearly $9 billion in federal funding for Harvard, demanded the university ban diversity, equity and inclusion practices, and crack down on some pro-Palestinian groups and masks in protests.

Harvard rejected numerous Trump demands last month, calling them an attack on free speech and academic freedom. It sued the Trump administration after it suspended about $2.3 billion in federal funding for the educational institution, while also pledging to tackle discrimination on campus.

In its lawsuit against the Trump administration, Harvard said the government's funding cuts will have stark ""real-life consequences for patients, students, faculty, staff, (and) researchers"" while putting in jeopardy crucial medical and scientific research.

Harvard has a $53 billion endowment, the largest of any U.S. university, but the funds are often restricted and used for things like financial aid and scholarships.

Out of all the tariff actions U.S. President Donald Trump has announced, the 100% levy on movies produced outside the U.S. ranks as one of the most bizarre, taking its place beside the head-scratching formula his administration used to determine the level of tariffs.

Trump didn't share details of how the tariff would work — or if it would actually be implemented — but the mere announcement of the levy was enough to bring down shares of entertainment and media companies like Netflix and Paramount.

Costs aside, how would those tariffs work on a cultural level? Would the Oscars remove its category for Best Foreign Film? Must all movies be set in the U.S. as well? Will American actors starring in international films be penalized?

Those may seem outlandish concerns, but predicting the next act of the U.S. president is near impossible —Trump is a cliffhanger embodied. Given that the presidential term seems to almost be a reality television series for Trump, his actions might be good for viewership, but not ideal for everyone else.

S&P 500 breaks winning streakU.S. markets fell Monday. The S&P 500 lost 0.64%, snapping a nine-day rally, its longest since 2004. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.24% and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.74%. U.S. crude oil futures fell about 2% Monday to its lowest settlement since February 2021 after OPEC+ agreed to hike production. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index added 0.16% amid a mixed showing in the region's bourses.

The end of an era for BuffettBerkshire Hathaway shares fell 4.9% Monday after Warren Buffett proposed Saturday for Greg Abel to replace him as CEO by the end of the year. The company's board voted unanimously Sunday to make Abel president and CEO on Jan. 1, 2026, and for Buffett to remain as chairman. Shares of the company have rocketed 5,502,284% between 1965, when Buffett took over Berkshire Hathaway, and the end of 2024.

More tariff developments from TrumpTrump announced Sunday that he would be imposing a 100% tariff on films produced outside the United States, but walked back on his comments the next day. On Sunday, Trump also downplayed the threat of supply shortages by saying girls ""could be very happy"" with fewer dolls. Finally, Trump signed an executive order Monday to reduce the amount of time it takes to approve pharmaceutical manufacturing plants in the America, and added he will announce pharmaceutical-specific tariffs within the next two weeks.

Palantir hikes outlook but shares fallPalantir shares tumbled almost 9% in extended trading after it reported earnings that met expectations. The company, which provides artificial intelligence software for governments and corporations, also hiked its full-year revenue outlook to between $3.89 billion and $3.90 billion. Palantir shares have defied 2025′s broad downtrend in technology stocks. Even after today's fall, the stock is up 64% this year.

Ford suspends its guidanceFord Motor beat Wall Street's first-quarter expectations, but suspended its 2025 financial guidance amid an expected $2.5 billion impact this year from Trump's tariffs. The Detroit automaker said it expects to offset $1 billion of those costs through remediation actions as well as volume and pricing expectations for a total impact of $1.5 billion in 2025. Shares fell around 2.5% in extended trading.

[PRO] Chinese ETF over U.S. tech? Chinese technology stocks have seen a volatile start to 2025, with substantial short-term swings in both directions. But the choppy price action year to date is within a constructive long-term context. This Chinese tech ETF could be a better bet than U.S. technology stocks, which appear relatively overextended, wrote Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies.

CNBC's Official Global Soccer Team Valuations 2025

The world's 25 most valuable soccer teams are worth an average of $2.76 billion, according to CNBC's Official Global Soccer Valuations 2025.

On average, the 25 most valuable teams generated revenue of $520 million and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of $54 million last season, based on CNBC's calculations.

The most valuable team is Real Madrid, worth $6.7 billion, according to CNBC's valuation. The Spanish team posted revenue of $1.13 billion. According to the 2025 Deloitte Football Money League report, Real Madrid's revenue increased 26% from the 2022-23 season, in part because renovations to Santiago Bernabéu Stadium fueled a doubling of match-day revenue to $268 million.

The recent bitcoin (BTC) price rally above $90,000 might have some holders eyeing a run to a new record topping the $109,000 hit in January. 

However, the path higher may not be so straightforward. The latest analysis by Glassnode shows potential for increased selling pressure from some groups of market participants at around $99,900.

For a start, long-term holders — defined by Glassnode as wallets that have held coins for at least 155 days — may take profits at $99,900. This aligns with their historical behavior of selling at price levels that deliver roughly 350% paper gains.

""Historically, LTHs begin distributing more aggressively around a 350% unrealized profit margin, which aligns with a $BTC price of ~$99.9k. As the market nears this level, increased sell-side pressure is likely, requiring strong demand to absorb it,"" Glassnode said in an analysis post on X.

A second source of selling pressure could be wallets that acquired coins early this year, when the largest cryptocurrency traded between $95,000 and $98,000. They weathered the sell-off to $75,000 last month and may be tempted to exit their positions at the breakeven or minor profit, at least partially. That's consistent with the behavioral aspects of trading, which suggests investors are quick to take gains while holding on to losing positions. 

""A large cluster of coins was acquired between $95k–$98k, meaning some $BTC holders may exit at breakeven. This, combined with rising LTH profits, creates a key resistance zone,"" Glassnode said. ""A clean breakout could open the path to price discovery above $100k.""

 Senior Contributor. 

Bitcoin and crypto prices have been thrust into the spotlight by U.S. president Donald Trump this year (while a Federal Reserve “nightmare” is suddenly coming true).

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price has rebounded to around $95,000 per bitcoin after dropping to April lows of $75,000, with a rare bitcoin price prediction by Trump's crypto czar David Sacks taking traders by surprise.

Now, as bitcoin hurtles toward what bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) giant BlackRock has called a “geopolitical fragmentation megaforce"" shock, a leak has revealed Wall Street companies are quietly betting on a Trump-fueled bitcoin price rally.

High-speed trading giant Tower Research Capital has joined Citadel Securities in ""bulking up its bets on cryptocurrencies,"" it was reported by Bloomberg, citing a leak from an anonymous source.

One of Tower Research Capital's trading groups has “increased capital allocation to its crypto trading book,” and upgraded its crypto market making infrastructure, the source told the financial newswire.

Wall Street is quietly ramping up its support for bitcoin and crypto as the Trump administration promises to open up access to bitcoin trading and crypto markets, rolling back Biden-era restrictions and fast-tracking legislation that will rewire the financial system.

Last week, Wall Street giants that manage a combined $10 trillion on behalf of clients are predicted to ""open for business"" on bitcoin this year, allowing advisors to recommend bitcoin ETFs to clients for the first time.

The dozen U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs, which rocketed to assets under management of more than $100 billion last year, pulled in almost $2 billion last week, according to data from SoSoValue, marking a return to growth after a recent period of outflows that mirrored the stock market's volatility.

“The flows are back in a big way,” BlackRock's head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, said during a recent bitcoin and crypto conference panel discussion, it was reported by The Block.

However, the market momentum seems to have fallen away over the last week, with the bitcoin price surge that propelled it to near $100,000 failing to carry it over the psychological barrier.

“Bitcoin has rallied 25% over the past month, supported by aggressive ETF inflows and institutional spot buying,” Markus Thielen, the chief executive of 10x Research, said in an emailed note, pointing to “weak funding rates” and “mounting” macro pressures as reason the bitcoin price rally may be fading.

""A potential consolidation is forming near the $95,000 level as traders await new catalysts. This is not a time for blind risk-taking but tactical positioning with well-defined exposure.""","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Two long-dormant Bitcoin whales moved 3,422 BTC—worth roughly $324.2 million—early Tuesday morning.

Both wallets had been inactive since 2014, when Bitcoin traded at well under $1,000, and the two transfers represent some of the largest movements by dormant Bitcoin whales observed in several years.

The identity the wallet owners and the reason for the move are unknown at the time of writing. It is also unknown if the wallets were owned by the same person or if they are in any way connected.

According to data from on-chain tracker Spot On Chain, one of the whales, “1NWPS,” resurfaced after 10.5 years, moving 2,343 Bitcoin (roughly $222.2 million). The other whale, “1PiEK,” resurfaced after 11.75 years, moving 1,079 Bitcoin (about $102.5 million).

⚠️ $324.2M in #Bitcoin on the move after over 10 years of dormancy!

In the past 3 hours, two Satoshi-era whales, who had been inactive since 2014, transferred 3,422 $BTC ($325M) to new wallets:

This surge in whale activity aligns with a particularly high activity for Bitcoin whales. Research from CryptoQuant released in April of this year found that during the first three months of 2025, over twice the amount—110% more—of long-dormant Bitcoin had been moved compared to the same period in 2024.

The analysts' on-chain data found that 62,800 BTC aged over 7 years were transferred between January and March 2025, compared to 28,000 BTC during Q1 2024.

The recent transfers follow one of the largest old-school whale resurgences ever recorded being spotted just months ago. In late March, a wallet inactive since 2016 moved over 3,000 Bitcoin in a series of consecutive transfers, worth over $250 million at the prices of the time, according to on-chain analyst Arkham Intelligence.

$250M BITCOIN WHALE WAKES UP AFTER 8 YEARS

A Bitcoin Whale that has held BTC since late 2016 has just moved over $250M in BTC last night.

Meanwhile, another Bitcoin whale moved 50 BTC for the first time in 15 years late last month, having purchased them at less than $0.10, netting them a theoretical gain of more than 93,000,000%.

Why Do Bitcoin Whales Resurface?

It can be difficult to understand why whales suddenly become active after long hibernations, due to the often anonymous nature of the wallet owners.

However, common reasons can include the owners wishing to take advantage of historically high prices by selling off Bitcoin.

But it can also simply be a crypto owner reshuffling their holdings—for example, moving their assets to or from a hardware-based cold wallet. Other possible reasons for long-dormant wallets coming to life include owners reclaiming their lost or forgotten keys or hardware wallets.

Vitalik Buterin wants to simplify Ethereum (ETH).

In a new blog post, the Ethereum co-founder praises how “beautifully simple” Bitcoin (BTC) is, which he says is key to the crypto king serving as a “globally trusted base layer.”

“Historically, Ethereum has often not done this (sometimes because of my own decisions), and this has contributed to much of our excessive development expenditure, all kinds of security risk, and insularity of R&D (research and development) culture, often in pursuit of benefits that have proven illusory.”

Buterin argues that simplicity can increase the number of people who can participate in protocol research and decrease the cost of creating new infrastructure. He also says simpler protocols have a reduced risk of catastrophic bugs and a smaller “social attack surface.”

The ETH co-founder outlines how Ethereum could come close to matching Bitcoin's level of simplicity within five years, starting with the consensus layer.

“The new consensus layer effort (historically called the ‘beam chain') aims to use all of our learnings in consensus theory, ZK-SNARK development, staking economics and other fields over the last ten years to create a long-term optimal consensus layer for Ethereum. This consensus layer is well-positioned to be much simpler than the status quo beacon chain.”

Buterin also wants to simplify Ethereum's execution layer.

“The EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) is increasingly growing in complexity, and much of that complexity has proven unnecessary (in many cases my own fault): a 256-bit virtual machine that over-optimized for highly specific forms of cryptography that are today becoming less and less relevant, and precompiles that over-optimized for single use cases that are barely being used.

Attempting to address these present-day realities piecemeal will not work. It took a huge amount of effort to (only partially!) remove the SELFDESTRUCT opcode, for a relatively small gain. The recent EOF (EVM Object Format) debate shows the challenges of doing the same thing to the VM.

As an alternative, I recently proposed a more radical approach: instead of making medium-sized (but still disruptive) changes to the EVM for the sake of a 1.5x gain, perform a transition to a new and much better and simpler VM for the sake of a 100x gain. 

Like the Merge, we have fewer points of disruptive change, but we make each one much more meaningful. Specifically, I suggested we replace the EVM with either RISC-V, or another VM that is the VM that Ethereum ZK-provers will be written in.”


At time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $1,803.

Ethereum price started a downside correction below the $1,850 zone. ETH is now consolidating and might drop further below the $1,785 support zone.

Ethereum Price Struggles To Clear Resistance

Ethereum price failed to clear the $1,880 resistance and started a downside correction, like Bitcoin. ETH declined below the $1,850 and $1,820 support levels.

There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,734 swing low to the $1,872 high. The bears even pushed the price below the $1,800 level, but the price found support near the $1,785 support level.

Ethereum price is now trading below $1,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,830 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,820 level. The next key resistance is near the $1,830 level and the trend line. The first major resistance is near the $1,880 level.

A clear move above the $1,880 resistance might send the price toward the $1,920 resistance. An upside break above the $1,920 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,000 resistance zone or even $2,050 in the near term.

More Losses In ETH?

If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,830 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,785 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,734 swing low to the $1,872 high. The first major support sits near the $1,750 zone.

A clear move below the $1,750 support might push the price toward the $1,720 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,685 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,640.

Technical Indicators

Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.

Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Frictionless flows are Ethereum's path to economic dominance","https://cointelegraph.com/news/frictionless-flows-are-ethereum-s-path","Tue, 06 May 2025 15:03:34 GMT","

 Frictionless capital movement between Ethereum's layer-2 rollups is the key to its economic dominance. Tariffing rollups could fragment the ecosystem. 

Opinion by: Barna Kiss, CEO of Malda

An idea recently floated by some prominent thinkers in the Ethereum space to reclaim value for the mainnet is the taxing of its Layer-2s. The future of Ethereum does not depend on policy but on enabling frictionless capital movement between the L2s in question. Tariffing rollups may appear a neat way to reclaim value for the mainnet. In practice, it would fragment the ecosystem, drain liquidity, push users toward centralized platforms, and avoid decentralized finance altogether. In a permissionless system, capital flows to where it is treated best, and Ethereum's rollups mistreat it.

In traditional finance, the link between fluidity and growth is well established. Lower barriers to capital inflows lead to higher investment. Take the European Union's pre-Brexit single market. Investment flows slowed when the United Kingdom's exit fragmented access to capital pools, as economists tracking cross-border activity noted. Ethereum faces a decentralized parallel. 

Rollups, particularly those that are optimistic and ZK-based, impose delays of up to a week on withdrawals and offer only patchy cross-rollup liquidity. The result is a fragmented system in which adoption slows, and capital is underused.

Developers are left with two poor choices. Either they focus on one rollup and limit their audience, or fragment liquidity across several and accept inefficiencies. Neither option serves the ecosystem's long-term interests. A significant opportunity lies, therefore, with protocols that remove these frictions. They will attract more capital, operate more efficiently, and deliver better experiences.

Recent: 3 reasons Ethereum could turn a corner

Capital movement must be abstracted away from the end-user. Bridges and withdrawal queues should become protocol-level concerns, not user problems. It is feasible for liquidity deployed on one rollup to satisfy demand on another, with background rebalancing ensuring solvency and efficiency. What today seems complex can be made invisible.

This design shift from reactive bridging to intent-based liquidity coordination would restore composability and preserve decentralization. More importantly, it would uphold Ethereum's core principles of building open systems without central gatekeepers. Without it, users will continue to rely on centralized exchanges to bypass friction, compromising self-custody for convenience. This is not just a technical challenge — it is a philosophical one.

Designing around capital efficiency is becoming a competitive edge. Tomorrow's DeFi protocols will not simply compete on fees or yield. They will compete on how well they can access liquidity across a fractured landscape. The winners will be those that can fulfill a user's request wherever the user is without requiring them to move funds manually. The result will be better UX, more productive capital, and higher network stickiness.

Some underlying technologies are beginning to address the problem. Ethereum-native rollups, planned after a hard fork in 2026, promise closer integration, and while they are still not ready for deployment, based rollups offer tighter alignment with Ethereum by sharing sequencing and improving settlement while sacrificing some independence. In the meantime, optimistic rollups are racing to implement zero-knowledge proofs to speed up exits. These innovations reduce friction, but they are not enough on their own. Scale will come from applications designed around these constraints, not from the base layers alone.

Zk-Rollups are particularly well suited for this. Their cryptographic structure allows for low-latency and trust-minimized messaging between chains. This makes them ideal for applications like payments, decentralized trading, and real-time financial products, all of which demand speed and certainty. If Ethereum can make such cross-rollup flows seamless, it will not just scale. It will become the backbone of a more efficient financial system.

That outcome is not guaranteed. Tariffing rollups may serve short-term goals, but in the long run, they would weaken the very network Ethereum aims to strengthen. Solana, for example, already offers composability within a single domain. While Ethereum's modular approach is arguably more robust, it cannot afford to ignore the usability cost of fragmentation.

Ethereum's greatest strength is its neutrality. That should include the ability of capital to move freely within its ecosystem. The future will not be built by taxing rollups. It will be built by enabling them to function as one economic engine.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Trump's Crypto Dinners & New Crypto Democratization Bill Could Rally These Best Altcoins","https://bitcoinist.com/trumps-crypto-dinners-new-crypto-democratization-bill-rally-best-altcoins/","Tue, 06 May 2025 13:16:37 GMT","

A potent mix of political showmanship and landmark regulatory proposals in the U.S. this month could be the spark for an explosive altcoin season.

Influential crypto insiders are watching two key developments:

1. President Trump's headline-grabbing crypto dinners, including a gala for his $TRUMP meme coin holders, are raising ethical questions

2. A new Digital Asset Market Structure Discussion Draft from House Republicans is on the legislative table, promising market democratization and clearer rules, favoring decentralization.

For new cryptos, these events stirring interest could positively impact growth, seeing greater returns for all.

Two dinners are the focus here. The first, a $1.5M per plate ‘Crypto & AI Innovators Dinner' by MAGA Inc. on May 5th, featured Crypto Czar David Sacks as a guest.

The second, a May 22nd gala for top $TRUMP meme coin holders, promises perks like a White House tour for the top 25 (from mostly pseudonymous wallets), sparking backlash.

Warren highlighted the Trump-linked stablecoin USD1, co-founded by Eric Trump, which saw a $2B investment from Abu Dhabi's MGX Group, becoming the world's seventh-largest.

She termed this as potential corruption, warning a Republican-backed stablecoin bill could ‘greenlight the grift.'

Watchdog Accountable.US labeled the $TRUMP gala ‘nakedly corrupt,' concerned about anonymous foreign holders (potentially Tron's Justin Sun) and claiming Trump affiliates hold roughly 80% of the token supply.

Despite uncertainties like potential cancellation or Trump's non-attendance, the $TRUMP meme coin's value surged over 50% after the dinner's announcement. Will this also affect other meme coins?

On May 5th, House Republicans Glenn Thompson and French Hill introduced a new Digital Asset Market Structure Discussion Draft.

The bill wants to curb larger firm influence and promote broader market participation by, for example, defining an ‘affiliated person' as owning over 1% of the project's digital commodity (down from 5% in FIT21).

Paradigm's Justin Slaughter sees this as fostering democratization.

The draft also defines a ‘mature blockchain system' (not under common control) and exempts self-directed DeFi trading protocols from certain registrations. The SEC would be the initial primary regulator.

However, it faces challenges. Ranking Member Maxine Waters reportedly plans to block a May 6th discussion event, citing committee rules.

Regulation and clarity could help best altcoins like $SUBBD (which aims to decentralize the creator economy) and $BTCBULL (which is linked to the hard-hitting Bitcoin), benefit from the general increased market interest.

Unlike speculative meme coins, SUBBD ($SUBBD) is a Web3 creator platform integrating AI tools.

It's fundamentally designed with decentralization in mind, aligning with the key themes of the proposed US regulations.

The focus on utility within the creator space, backed by a defined token structure, places $SUBBD in the spotlight, especially as regulatory clarity potentially emerges and the market continues to value sustainable growth.

By offering a fully-integrated user-centric platform powered by the $SUBBD token, the project addresses crippling platform fees, a lack of genuine ownership for creators and fans, the inefficiency of having to use multiple tools, and static fan subscriptions.

Overall, $SUBBD will foster a fairer and more rewarding ecosystem for all.

There are also many more benefits for $SUBBD holders. To access these, check out our step-by-step how-to-buy guide.



SUBBD seems well aligned to upcoming policy changes, making it a well-placed altcoin to potentially see big gains in the future.

Given the current excitement in the crypto market, where Bitcoin often takes centre stage (even being part of the US's Strategic Bitcoin Reserve), BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) offers an appealing way for investors to gain exposure to $BTC's momentum and earn passive income without buying $BTC itself.

$BTCBULL holders, when using Best Wallet (a leading non-custodial crypto wallet), can receive $BTC airdrops when Bitcoin reaches significant price milestones of $150K and $200K.



That's not all, though. Token burns and additional $BTCBULL airdrops are also in store.

Furthermore, staking $BTCBULL currently offers the potential for impressive rewards up to 77% APY, significantly enhancing returns for holders.

With this bullish token having impressively raised over $5M of its $6M target, the time is now to get on board this bronco. Learn how to buy $BTCBULL in our guide and how far we think it'll go in our price prediction.

Let's slow things down a bit and chill.

That's the idea behind Chill Guy ($CHILLGUY), a meme coin that's all about being lowkey, calm, casual, and definitely not making a big deal out of things.

It could be a welcome change from the hype and endless news you see in the crypto space.

The mission is clear. It wants to spread the art of staying chill in what can be a pretty chaotic world. It's about making mindfulness accessible and something everyone can relate to, because life's all about being present and just taking one moment at a time.

Being part of the Solana network, $CHILLGUY has seen an uptake in trading volume and market cap recently, which means people are starting to take notice. Maybe it's really time to relax a little and take some lessons from Chill Guy.



You can purchase $CHILLGUY for $0.04977, and that price has seen a small bump of around 2.55% in the last day.

It makes you wonder, with the potential changes on the horizon, and the recent Trump news, will a coin that's super laid back continue to rise, and spread its mindful message?

With US political discussions and potential new crypto rules causing a buzz, the resulting hype could bring different kinds of projects like $SUBBD and $BTCBULL into focus, and netting holders potentially big returns.

While these shifts could definitely open up some opportunities, it's good to remember that the crypto market is volatile and speculative, so do your own research before making any investment decisions.

A closely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin may have one last breakout rally before altcoins start to outperform BTC.

The pseudonymous analyst known as Rekt Capital tells his 546,300 followers on the social media platform X that the Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) metric may soon peak, opening the doors for altcoins to ignite explosive moves to the upside.

BTC.D calculates how much of the crypto market cap belongs to BTC. A peaking Bitcoin dominance chart suggests that altcoins are close to outshining BTC.

“Bitcoin dominance has one final leg left in its macro uptrend on the road to 71% (red). Any dips into 64% would constitute a retest. A successful retest would enable final trend continuation on the road to 71% (green box).”

At time of writing, Bitcoin dominance currently stands at 64.82%.

Next up, the analyst says that Bitcoin needs to hold a key support level at $93,500 on the weekly chart to maintain bullish momentum.

“Bitcoin has rejected from the lower high resistance (black diagonal). Going forward, Bitcoin will need to hold the $93,500 range low to fully confirm a reclaim of the range.”

Lastly, the analyst says Bitcoin may follow a similar pattern seen in April of 2024 on the weekly chart, eventually hitting new all-time highs if it plays out.

“This idea was first explored in mid-October 2024 and actually ended up playing out. It would be poetry if Bitcoin repeated history and followed through on the same path in this current range as well. For history to repeat, BTC would need to:

 Unbeknownst to many, thanks to regulatory shifts, stablecoins gaining ground and major institutions building on-chain infrastructure, blockchain is moving from experimental to essential within finance. Below are the developments serving as key contributors in 2025.Regulatory shiftsThe US Federal Reserve has relaxed its 2022 stance, no longer requiring banks to get explicit approval to offer crypto services. Similar signals from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency show that regulators are starting to treat blockchain as a legitimate tool.At the same time, SEC Chair Paul Atkins is pushing for clearer, innovation-friendly crypto rules, moving away from vague enforcement tactics and toward a more structured regulatory framework.Stablecoin stampedeThe stablecoin market capitalization has climbed to nearly $240 billion as of late April 2025, brushing up against an all-time high. Regulators are also stepping up. In Europe, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework is now fully live, laying down clear ground rules for crypto assets. For stablecoins, that means strict 1:1 reserve requirements and a crackdown on anything resembling an algorithmic model without real backing. Meanwhile, in the US, lawmakers are making moves, too. The STABLE Act, reintroduced in March, proposes tighter oversight over stablecoin issuers and even suggests a two-year freeze on new algorithmic coins.

Unbeknownst to many, thanks to regulatory shifts, stablecoins gaining ground and major institutions building on-chain infrastructure, blockchain is moving from experimental to essential within finance. Below are the developments serving as key contributors in 2025.

The US Federal Reserve has relaxed its 2022 stance, no longer requiring banks to get explicit approval to offer crypto services. Similar signals from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency show that regulators are starting to treat blockchain as a legitimate tool.



At the same time, SEC Chair Paul Atkins is pushing for clearer, innovation-friendly crypto rules, moving away from vague enforcement tactics and toward a more structured regulatory framework.

The stablecoin market capitalization has climbed to nearly $240 billion as of late April 2025, brushing up against an all-time high.

 As of 2025, blockchain is helping streamline settlements, tighten compliance, and transform cross-border payments from a headache into a smooth operation. Here's how:Real-time settlement and clearingMoving money between banks — especially across borders — used to be a slow, messy process.

As of 2025, blockchain is helping streamline settlements, tighten compliance, and transform cross-border payments from a headache into a smooth operation. 

Here's how:

Moving money between banks — especially across borders — used to be a slow, messy process. Layers of intermediaries meant delays, high fees and plenty of room for errors.

By cutting out intermediaries and verifying transactions directly, blockchain enables near-instant settlement, slashing turnaround times dramatically.

In fact, JPMorgan's Kinexys platform (part of its Onyx suite) now processes over $2 billion in daily transactions, using JPM Coin to settle payments across banks and currencies in real time.

It's an example of a live system handling serious volume with the help of a blockchain.

Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks have always been necessary — but painfully slow and repetitive.

Blockchain offers a smarter way to handle them. A tamper-proof ledger allows banks to securely store and share verified customer information, speeding up audits and reducing compliance headaches.

Another real-world example from JPMorgan is Liink, which runs a blockchain-inspired service called Confirm, which helps banks validate over 2 billion bank accounts across more than 3,500 financial institutions, dramatically improving efficiency for KYC processes.

Sending money internationally used to take days and came with hefty fees.

With blockchain, transactions can settle in minutes, and fees are significantly lower.

Real-world moves:

Even Deloitte estimates that blockchain could slash cross-border payment costs by 40%-80%, saving the industry up to $24 billion a year.

This all shows that banks are betting real money and real infrastructure on blockchain delivering real value.

Did you know? Visa's Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP) allows banks to mint, burn and transfer fiat-backed tokens, such as tokenized deposits and stablecoins.

Of course, blockchain isn't a panacea. There are a few things banks need to keep in mind:

Behind the scenes, accounting and auditing firms are also finding that blockchain can fix long-standing pain points. That's what will be explored next.

 Accounting and auditing might not be flashy headlines, but behind the scenes, blockchain is slowly changing how financial data is managed, verified and reported.Better data security and fraud preventionWith blockchain, once a transaction is recorded, it can't be altered without consensus from the network. This built-in immutability drastically reduces the risk of tampering or fraud and strengthens the integrity of financial records.More transparency = better auditsAuditors no longer need to stitch together fragmented information from multiple systems. Blockchain provides a single, real-time, tamper-proof trail of transactions, making audits faster, more accurate and more reliable.Streamlined reconciliation and reportingBlockchain simplifies day-to-day reporting, too. Instead of manually reconciling across different ledgers, authorized parties all have access to a shared, automatically updating record.Adoption challengesOf course, it's not all smooth sailing.Lack of standardization: There's still no universal rulebook for blockchain accounting. Groups like the AICPA and the International Accounting Standards Board are issuing early guidance, but without global standards, firms must tread carefully.Integration woes: Most firms still use legacy enterprise resource planning and accounting platforms that weren't designed for blockchain. Integrating — or deciding when to overhaul — poses serious technical and financial challenges.Regulatory uncertainty: Regulations around digital assets and blockchain-based transactions are evolving fast. Firms must keep their internal controls and reporting practices agile to stay compliant.Did you know? The concept of triple-entry accounting, enabled by blockchain, adds a third component to traditional double-entry systems.

 In 2025, blockchain is a practical tool for chief financial officers and treasurers looking to sharpen financial reporting, improve operational efficiency, and strengthen risk controls.Strategic applicationsReal-time financial reporting and analysis: Blockchain's tamper-proof, real-time data streams give CFOs instant access to financial performance. No more waiting for reconciliations — finance teams can forecast and pivot with live numbers at their fingertips.Smart contracts for compliance and transactions: Smart contracts automate routine processes like compliance checks and payment executions, reducing human error and ensuring agreements are enforced exactly as written.Tokenization for capital raising and asset management: Tokenizing assets such as real estate, equipment or equity opens new doors for raising capital and improving liquidity. Fractional ownership models also make it easier to access a broader investor base.Risk management considerationsWhile blockchain enhances security overall, it's not invulnerable. Strong access controls, regular audits and active network monitoring are essential to protect systems and assets. Organizations also need contingency plans in place, since blockchain networks can experience outages or latency issues; having off-chain fallback procedures ensures business continuity during disruptions.Finally, CFOs and treasurers must stay actively engaged, working closely with legal teams and regulators to stay ahead of compliance risks and future-proof their operations.

Bitcoin has dramatically altered the financial world over the past decade and a half. However, the blockchain that underpins the most dominant cryptocurrency in the world can process only five to seven transactions per second. In contrast, an impending update to Solana will allow the blockchain to process roughly one million transactions per second.

In the report Understanding Solana for Financial Services, Joel Hugentobler, Cryptocurrency Analyst at Javelin Strategy & Research, examined the upgrades in the works for Solana, its potential to make a significant impact on financial services, and the emerging use cases for this powerful technology.

The Solana blockchain not only will be much faster than bitcoin but it will also be 10 to 15 times faster than credit card rails like Visa and Mastercard. This substantial increase in Solana's throughput will come to fruition through the Firedancer upgrade.

“This isn't just theoretical,” Hugentobler said. “Jump Trading—the brains behind this upgrade—they're notorious for high-frequency trading. Coming in and providing this extra validator not only diversifies the code base, which adds additional security, but obviously adds that crazy throughput with 400-millisecond finality. It's not just theory—they've had multiple demos where they are executing these volumes of transactions live.”

Scaling to this speed would not be possible if Solana didn't already have robust architecture in place. One of the key benefits of the network is it reduces counterparty risk—the chance that an unknown third party doesn't hold up its end of the transaction.

In addition to speed and security gains, Solana is less expensive than the leading blockchain, Ethereum. Solana's fees are less than a penny compared with Ethereum transaction fees, which can range from $1 to $50.

The speed, security, and cost benefits of Solana make the blockchain a strong fit for financial services applications. Once the Firedancer upgrade is live, Solana can do even more to eliminate many of the issues financial services firms have faced.

“Their architecture, with this upgrade, supports real-time settlement in traditional payment rails,” Hugentobler said. “But what's really cool about all this is it eliminates batch processing, which is a significant pain point in legacy systems.”

A significant barrier that has kept many institutions from fully investing in digital assets is concerns about the security of financial data. Although blockchain is inherently a secure and transparent network, financial institutions have specific compliance and risk management demands.

To meet this need, Solana has introduced technologies like token extensions, which can protect private data on the blockchain. Token extensions enable developers to create tokens with unique features designed for specific use cases.

For example, token extensions can give institutions the capability for confidential transfers, which allow merchants to maintain confidentiality of transaction amounts while financial institutions have visibility into other transaction details for compliance purposes.

Token extensions can also enable memo fields, which allow additional information to be included with payments.

The blockchain's token extensions were a key factor behind PayPal's decision to bring its stablecoin, PYUSD, from Ethereum to Solana. The payments giant credited the speed and efficiency of the blockchain as the driving forces behind the success of PYUSD and said the added customization provided by token extensions meant that Solana essentially provided “compliance in a box.”

As powerful as token extensions are, they are also due for an upgrade. Helius Labs and Solana Labs recently announced an extension of the confidential transfers token extension called confidential balances.

Confidential balances are built to enable private token transfers within institutional compliance. In addition to tools that protect data, confidential balances also allow for partial confidentiality, which means organizations can determine whether to fully conceal specific token amounts or just to mask certain aspects.

Some of the use cases for this added functionality are in payroll, B2B payments, and other scenarios where particular regulatory requirements come into play. Solana has also developed auditor keys, which give institutions more insight into transactions without overreaching on compliance.

All these innovations mean Solana is poised to deliver on more of an institution's needs.

“Solana with this upgrade has enabled token extensions which allow KYC, AML, compliance, transaction freezing, things like metadata tagging, confidential transfers, and real privacy transfers—all on a public blockchain,” Hugentobler said. “These extension capabilities enable financial institutions to operate like a private type blockchain, but it's all on a public blockchain, which is a compelling hybrid model in my eyes.”

These characteristics have made Solana a top choice for tokenizing real-world assets—which can be an intensive process. For example, Franklin Templeton recently moved the third-largest tokenized money market fund, valued at $594 million, onto the blockchain.

However, the use cases for Solana can go much further.

“Solana is being used by big names like Visa, PayPal, and Franklin Templeton,” Hugentobler said. “They're using it for stablecoins, cross-border payments, tokenized funds, treasury settlement, that sort of thing. It's moved past the speculative phase; it's being used for real use cases.”

The Firedancer upgrade should make Solana an even more compelling choice for financial services companies, once it is live.

“Frankendancer is the hybrid upgrade between Firedancer and what's existing, a smooth process that's fully live,” Hugentobler said. “It has consensus live voting and all that sort of thing on the back end. Firedancer is live, but it doesn't have the consensus model fully live, so the voting and things like that are not 100% quite yet, but they are saying it should go fully live this quarter.”

ByBoaz Sobrado,

 Contributor. 

At 3 PM, when most of his peers are slowly finishing their workday, a 23-year-old man who goes by the name “0xExceed” is just beginning his. From his apartment in Asia, he rubs sleep from his eyes, makes coffee, and logs into Discord. Over the next 14 hours, until about 5 AM, alongside his co-founders they'll manage their NFT project whilst coordinating with artists across multiple time zones, and engaging with a community of thousands.

In 2021, this schedule wouldn't have raised eyebrows. But in 2025, when most mainstream observers have written off NFTs as a passing fad, 0xExceed's dedication seems almost anachronistic. While his university classmates pursue careers in AI startups or TikTok agencies, he and his team remain passionately committed to digital art ownership.

He isn't alone. NFT collectives like Pudgy Penguins, Remilia, Azuki, and Claynosaurz been grinding on, seemingly oblivious to the NFT winter. These projects have wildly different goals and communities: while Azuki's mission is ‘honoring anime's cultural legacy”, Pudgy Penguins floods Walmart with cute plush penguins and Remilia advances a political-cultural movement loosely defined as “network spirituality”. But they share NFTs as a common factor.

""People keep saying NFTs are dead, but our community remains passionate,"" says 0xExceed, whose ""Pixel vs Pixel"" art competition recently attracted hundreds of submissions from around the world. ""The technology is evolving, and so are we.""

This persistence isn't isolated. Despite NFT trading volumes down significantly from their 2021 peak, communities of creators and collectors continue to thrive. And according to Devin Finzer, CEO and co-founder of OpenSea, the world's largest NFT marketplace, this evolution is exactly what we should expect.

""If you zoom out, there's a ton of exciting things happening in tech overall with the rise of AI. It's becoming easier to create content and build software applications,"" Finzer explained in a recent interview. ""The big thesis we have is that crypto and blockchains are a key piece of infrastructure for all the things happening in tech right now.""

The raw numbers tell a dramatic story: NFT trade volumes have plummeted from their August 2021 peak of over $3.2 billion per week to current levels below $100 million. This 97% decline might suggest the NFT market is in terminal decline, but Finzer sees a more nuanced reality.

NFT trading volume by chain

""There have been some substitutes for what NFTs represented early on in 2021,"" Finzer explained, pointing to the explosive rise of meme coins that have attracted billions of dollars in trading volume. ""Some of that has been absorbed by the meme coin craze, where it's more liquid, it's fungible, and you can trade it around and get in and out more easily.""

Many successful NFT projects have also evolved by embracing their own ecosystem tokens, creating hybrid models that blend the community aspects of NFTs with the liquidity of fungible tokens. ""A good example is that now many NFT projects have both a token component and an NFT component,"" Finzer explained.

This market shift has occurred alongside fierce competition for NFT marketplace dominance. OpenSea's journey illustrates this volatility, with its market share plunging from over 70% in 2021 to as low as 15% in 2022, before recently rebounding to 58% following its platform upgrades and ecosystem token announcements.

Another significant shift is that NFTs have gotten cheaper. Not just because prices crashed, but also because buying and selling NFTs became a lot less expensive. “We now have faster, more inexpensive, higher throughput chains. You can have an entire economy where you buy an NFT for 50 cents and maybe the most rare one is $50. That's a much more healthy ecosystem than in 2021 when your cheapest NFT was at least $1,000 if not $5,000.”

Meanwhile, adjacent digital ownership models are thriving. Counter-Strike skins recently hit an all-time high with a market cap approaching $5 billion. Finzer attributes part of this success to accessibility: ""If you're buying an in-game skin for Counter-Strike, you don't have to fiddle with self-custody, you don't have to fiddle with wallets.""

Fortunately for OpenSea, recent rulings, particularly the landmark recent court ruling between Apple and Epic Games, are set to transform NFT accessibility on mobile platforms. This ruling effectively ends Apple's monopoly on in-app payments, opening significant opportunities for NFT marketplaces like OpenSea.

Finzer enthusiastically responded when asked about the impact of this ruling. ""We just launched our open beta for what we're calling OS2, which is the brand new version of OpenSea, which lets you discover, and trade anything on chain."" Finzer explained that this court decision directly addresses a major barrier: ""The next things on our roadmap are really bringing that to mobile in the most delightful possible way for people to really get on board easily."" He emphasized that ""the Apple ruling is going to be great for that because the in-app purchase situation has held us back for a good amount of time.""

This change means users will soon be able to purchase NFTs directly through iOS apps without prohibitive fees. Previously, OpenSea's mobile app didn't allow purchases because Apple's 30% commission made it ""cost prohibitive"" for their peer-to-peer marketplace model. With these restrictions lifted, Finzer believes it will bring down the barriers to entry and be ""great for consumers"" who will have easier access to NFT experiences on mobile.

The regulatory environment for NFTs and crypto more broadly has improved significantly, according to Finzer. Following recent political changes in the US, many investigations of crypto companies have been ended. He noted that during the previous regulatory uncertainty, many smaller creators were hesitant to participate in the ecosystem.

One of the most compelling aspects of NFTs that has persisted through market fluctuations is their role in establishing digital identity and community membership. This was dramatically illustrated when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin changed his profile picture to Remilia Corporation's Milady NFT earlier this year, causing a significant market reaction.

""There's something about owning a digital asset and going and making that purchase and then setting it as your profile picture on social media that demonstrates that you're part of that community,"" Finzer observed. ""It can demonstrate a mindset shift.""

He compared the CryptoPunks community to this phenomenon: “When you buy a CryptoPunk, you're immediately welcomed into this really vibrant community... It really does give you immediate recognition of what that person stands for.”

We've also seen community membership evolve in projects like Pudgy Penguins. What began in 2021 as chubby, playful flightless birds has morphed into a full‑blown consumer brand. Pudgy Penguins can now be found across toy‑store shelves and on viral TikTok videos. There's even a Solana‑based PENGU ecosystem token whose drop this year vaulted into the top 10 by trading volume. As founder Luca Netz puts it, ‘the Trojan horse for crypto adoption is IP,' and Pudgy's journey from niche collectible to mainstream merch proof‑points that thesis in action.

At the same time, anime‑focused Azuki has leaned into storytelling and fan collaboration. Founder Alex ‘Zagabond' Xu describes Azuki's mission as “honoring anime's cultural legacy while pioneering new creator‑funding models.” Like many other projects, it now has its own ecosystem token. Over half of the ANIME token went to its NFT holders, which “underscored how digital communities can co‑own IP development, from story arcs to funding anime productions”.

Finzer views the current state of NFTs as part of a natural cycle that new technologies typically experience. ""With any new technology, there's always this period where things get really exciting. People get interested in the use cases, and there's this sort of period of mania, and that's really what we saw in 2021,"" he said.

“But then it's typically followed by a longer period of people building infrastructure and use cases and innovating. And I think that's what we've seen over the last couple of years.”

This perspective aligns with what we've seen in other technological revolutions, from the internet itself to mobile applications. The initial hype gives way to a more sustained period of development where the true value emerges.

While much of the early attention focused on digital art and collectibles, Finzer sees NFTs as part of a broader digital ownership layer that will be essential as more of our lives move online. ""OpenSea has really expanded from just being an NFT marketplace to being a place where you can discover, own, and trade anything on chain,"" Finzer noted, highlighting the platform's evolution beyond its original narrow focus.

In fact, NFTs have been proving us they are more than “just NFTs”: From Azuki's community‑driven entry into the anime industry to Pudgy Penguins' toy‑line partnerships. New projects are leaning in strongly to the “online identity” aspect, with for instance 0xExceed's KazeCreations' moving from PFPs to banners and high-fashion physicals. This demonstrates NFTs' power as online programmable IP, not just digital JPEGs.

One emerging trend that Finzer finds particularly interesting is the connection between physical items and NFTs. ""There are now a number of companies building physical items that are represented as NFTs,"" he explained.

He highlighted Courtyard, which has been ""doing significant revenue, significant volume"" by allowing people to trade rare Pokemon cards represented as NFTs and then receive the actual physical item on demand.

""They fly under the radar a little bit because they're not necessarily your typical NFT project, but they're just a great example of the flexibility and usefulness of NFTs,"" Finzer said. “They do not have to just be pure digital collectibles or art, they can represent all sorts of things.”

The rise of generative AI is creating new opportunities for NFTs, according to Finzer. ""It's just made it infinitely easier to create content,"" he explained. “If you're a developer and you want to build a game, or if you're an artist and you want to create art, it's just so easy to do that now.”

As these AI-powered applications grow, Finzer believes many developers will want ""some way to have unique digital ownership"" within them, which is where NFTs can play a critical role.

Interestingly, rather than seeing AI as a threat to NFT value, Finzer sees it enhancing the importance of provable digital ownership. ""For digital art, where there's elements of human culture, I think you really even more so need a provable digital ownership layer,"" he said.

Finzer also pointed to a number of exciting Web3 games in development, including Parallel, a trading card game on the blockchain. Many of these projects are integrating AI and continuing to build and ship despite the market fluctuations.

Another notable example of NFTs powering gaming experiences is Claynosaurz. Their gaming experience is launching with Gameloft, a mainstream game publishing studio known for popular titles such as the Modern Combat series, The Amazing Spider-Man, Gods of Rome, and Despicable Me: Minion Rush. Moreover, the project earned recognition at the 2025 Collision Awards, a prestigious event that honors excellence in animation across all disciplines including film, television, and gaming. The Collision Awards, established in 2024 by industry leaders and the organizers of the long-running Telly Awards, brings together judges from major studios like Disney, Pixar, and Nickelodeon to evaluate global submissions. Claynosaurz's 3D dinosaur characters won in multiple categories, showcasing how NFT projects can produce animation quality that stands alongside traditional entertainment giants. These are no longer the pixelated images NFTs are often associated with.

Despite the ups and downs of the NFT market, Finzer remains convinced that digital ownership will be a fundamental part of our increasingly online lives.

""NFTs are going to play a critical role in society going forward,"" Finzer asserted. “I think there needs to be a digital ownership layer... as more and more people move to the digital world.”

As AI continues to advance, as gaming ecosystems grow more sophisticated, and as more of our identities become tied to digital assets, NFTs may indeed fulfill the vision that Finzer and other early advocates have promoted. Not as speculative assets but as essential infrastructure for the digital future.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","From Speculation to Stewardship: Preserving Digital Culture on the Blockchain","https://www.artdependence.com/articles/from-speculation-to-stewardship-preserving-digital-culture-on-the-blockchain/","Tue, 06 May 2025 14:12:11 GMT","


                        The NFT boom of 2020 was an explosive moment in the history of digital art. Seemingly overnight a somewhat obscure category of contemporary art took center stage, alongside a powerful and nebulous technology – ‘the blockchain.'
                    


The art world was upended by the disruptive new market that emerged and quickly sought to adopt the interests and tastes of its patrons. Major auction houses led the charge – their business model was a natural fit – aligning with the speculative aspects of the new market. Galleries experimented with offering NFTs, and museums followed suit, by alluring donors with NFT-based membership and ticketing and opening up their collections to NFTs. 
 
In the years that followed, the art world evolved beyond speculation about the NFT market and the transactional aspects of blockchain toward the potential the technology offers for preservation and storage. After a period of frenzied crypto-oriented experimentation, arts organizations began slowing down and thinking about this technology on longer timescales. An emerging group of artists and institutions have begun exploring how the core components of blockchains – decentralization and encryption – can help preserve culture for the next 100 years and unlock new potentials for cooperative data stewardship.
Surveying the vast landscape of ‘blockchain in the arts' today three distinct categories emerge: Engagement, Collecting, and Preservation. The first category is the most prolific – museums and cultural organizations engaging their audiences with tokenized on-chain experiences. These transactions are preserved on the blockchain's ‘immutable public ledger' as a lasting record of an exchange. Engagement initiatives are primarily led by development and educational departments within the institution, and take the form of ticketing, participatory programming, or new membership models. These initiatives aim to cultivate a new donor class or grow audience, and oftentimes are presented under the auspices of tech literacy. For example, the MoMA Postcard project, a “participatory blockchain art project,” was framed as “an invitation for anyone to learn, experiment, collaborate, and create value together with web3 technologies.” More recently the Metropolitan Museum of Art launched ArtLinks, a blockchain-based game which “presents an innovative way to engage with the Museum.”
A similar focus on transactions is at the core of the second category, Collecting. Many museums have acquired NFTs, including LACMA, The Centre Pompidou, and The Whitney Museum of American Art. NFTs represent a new way to handle exchange of ownership of digital assets. The chain of custody is recorded transparently and available for all to see online, along with the artwork. Curatorial is the driving force for acquisitions, but given the format of NFTs, their addition to a museum's collection is primarily an engagement with the legal functions of the institution. Once acquired, NFTs enter into a museum's accession workflow which treats a born-digital artwork in a much more robust manner.
Herein lies the opportunity of the third category, Preservation. In the broader GLAM ecosystem (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) future-thinking cultural institutions are experimenting with blockchain-based storage for preservation and conservation of their archives and born-digital artworks. The standard for preservation-grade storage is ‘3 copies, in 3 locations,' and archivists have long adopted the mantra ‘lots of copies keep stuff safe.' Immutable and verifiable storage on blockchains like Filecoin offers additional benefits, with cryptographic proofs that archives are being stored in their original form. Storing the bits and bytes that make up an archival information package on the blockchain – as opposed to a single display copy or on-chain code snippet included in NFTs – requires a deep engagement with the infrastructure and departments within an institution. Such an initiative at a traditional museum would require collaboration across curatorial, registrar, collections, and conservation, which handles identity and iteration reports, treatment plans, condition assessments, and other essential documentation that ensures a born-digital artwork will last 100 years.
The Internet Archive is leveraging decentralized storage for its collections, which has become a crucial cultural record at this moment as information disappears from the internet. The Prelinger Library boasts an essential collection of cultural ephemera, and is exploring how decentralized storage can ensure the longevity of their collection and offer more resilient and censorship-resistant access to the data in their sprawling archives. University archives such as Harvard's Library Innovation Lab are enhancing discovery and engagement with open data and exploring new ways to preserve digital information using decentralized storage. 
Institutions experimenting with blockchain-backed preservation are leading the way for a huge shift in the way we understand our data. Culture at large is coming into an awareness of the precarity of data and the value it represents.Technology companies have amassed huge fortunes from user-generated data, and the political implications of the extractive practices of these giants have come into view. Mass exodus from social media platforms and divestment from big tech is shifting the landscape of how we understand the power of our data.
Looking back across the history of art, artists are often the drivers of new ways of seeing and the catalysts of change in moments of cultural upheaval. One group of artists is working to explore how blockchain-backed storage can shift the value of data to creators. By leveraging these technologies to explore distributive justice and data sovereignty, they are prototyping a new system of value for data. 
TRANSFER Data Trust is a group of international digital artists building a cooperative model of data stewardship which transforms our current understanding of the financial and cultural value of data. The initiative seeks to create a ‘proof of concept' for resilient cultural infrastructure which is fully owned by the creators themselves, freeing data from the hands of big tech. By leveraging the power of blockchain-backed encryption to take ownership of data in a new way, they are demonstrating a different path forward for cultural legacy.
Such a shift will require careful collaboration and value realignment across the cultural sector. The momentous shift of NFTs was driven by rapid speculation, but the transformative power of blockchain technologies is operating on a much longer timescale. At its core, blockchain is an immutable public ledger which is actively recording a great shift in power across sectors.Traditional art institutions engaging more deeply with this technology beyond tokenization will activate a new era of cultural value creation.

                    NGO New World Immigration began accepting donations in ETN, one of the first in the industry | Photo: NWM Press                    

Around eight years have passed since the booming era of ICOs. It was a time when hundreds, perhaps thousands, of crypto projects collectively raised billions, primarily based on a lot of hype around blockchain technology.

The regrettable fact is that about 90% of those projects failed, collapsed, or pulled the rug, and very few survived into 2025.

However, one of the few ICO projects still actively innovating that deserves mention today is Electroneum, a British-born and based blockchain company. 

Nearly a decade down the line and over four million users later, Electroneum continues to innovate. They have built and maintained one of the fastest blockchains with transaction finality in five seconds or less and transaction fees as low as .0001 ETN.

Electroneum is difficult to compare with other blockchain projects, as its purpose is and has always been unique. 

The team has focused massively on delivering real-world solutions to real-world problems in areas that many other projects have simply ignored. Electroneum's mobile-first approach was and continues to be unique.

For many years, Electroneum benefited hundreds of thousands of users in African, Asian, and Latin American countries, where very little goes a long way. Unlike Pi Network, which allows mobile phone mining for tokens with no clear use case, Electroneum's mobile mining era (until 2019) rewarded mining participants with approximately $3 worth of ETN, enough to purchase monthly airtime and data in many developing countries.

Given their achievements, it came as no surprise that in 2019, Electroneum received City AM's Crypto Award for Social Impact and Sustainability. As the London newspaper said, “They won the prize for empowering people in developing countries and the unbanked.” 

They are trailblazers, too. In a 2019 article, top-tier crypto news outlet Coindesk lauded Electroneum's launch of an $80 “dirt-cheap” M1 Android smartphone that rewarded users with crypto. 

No other crypto project had come up with this brilliant idea. Inspired by them, others would soon follow, such as Solana. By the way, it's still available on eBay for under $30, because they later decided to drop the price to make it even more accessible for those with less financial means.

Their CEO and Founder, prominent British entrepreneur Richard Ells, focused more on providing millions of the financially excluded with crypto services that truly addressed their issues, such as instant payments and portability, even in marginalised communities.

With that vision and mission in mind, the Electroenum leadership went to Cambodia, where they sealed a first-of-its-kind deal within the crypto industry. 

The agreement with the Asian country's largest mobile operator, Cellcard, meant ETN app users could top up their airtime and data using ETN. Additionally, Cellcard agreed to purchase one million M1 smartphones, which they displayed in their shops nationwide.

The agreement also meant Cellcard users can earn ETN rewards of up to $3 per month, which they can convert into ETN tokens and top up their Cellcard accounts.

Electroneum is also credited with becoming the first blockchain startup to join the GSM Association. This non-profit trade association represents the interests of more than 750 mobile network operators worldwide. As reported by Decrypt, the GSMA gave the M1 its stamp of approval, a highly significant achievement for any mobile phone vendor.

Dozens of top crypto projects entered a downturn phase, and Electroneum has not been an exception. This brought on many external and internal challenges within their vast community. Support waned and disappointment grew, but all projects, even Ethereum, Cardano, and Ripple, have faced fierce criticism from experts as well as community leaders.

That era, brought on in part by the COVID-19 global crisis and exacerbated by the crypto winter of 2022 that wiped out roughly $2 trillion worth of crypto asset, caused the collapse of many more blockchain projects, but forwardthinking as Ells has proven to be, he took advantage to build, paving the way for Electroneum's entrance into a new evolutionary phase.

His team got busy focusing on expanding its blockchain capabilities, ecosystem, and global reach. Ells publicly announced the start of the new era in May 2020, marking a new chapter for Electroneum.

The phase meant the team would leverage blockchain technology to bolster their financial inclusion mission for those marginalised by banks. And also to significantly expand their ecosystem, hence the recent Electroneum Hackathon, and global reach.

Project Aurelius is central to Electroneum's transformation, a significant upgrade to the blockchain's core infrastructure. The result is an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain powered by the Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance (IBFT) consensus mechanism, capable of 5-second transaction finality and ultra-low fees (as low as 0.0001 ETN).

The upgrade enables smart contract functionality using Solidity and Vyper, making it easier for developers to build decentralised applications on the network. It also improves performance for peer-to-peer payments, which is essential for real-world commerce and merchant adoption.

Its ecosystem includes the first decentralised Fiverr-like freelance platform, which was hugely well-received by thousands, if not tens of thousands, of financially excluded people worldwide. These individuals found they could earn ETH by completing digital tasks. It purportedly supports millions of users globally. 

Unlike most charitable organisations, the project also continues to work closely with some amazing NGOs that have genuinely proven their efforts to help women, children, and their families in the short, medium, and long term. It also continues collaborating with Ripple, Quant, and the British Digital Pound Foundation to enhance CBDC governance and interoperability.

The European Central Bank (ECB) said it set up an innovation hub with 70 participants to test its digital euro project.

The participants included start-ups, banks and payment services including global professional services company Accenture, Swiss telecommunications company Swisscom, Spanish bank CaixaBank and audit and tax firm KPMG, it said in a Monday release. The companies have signed up to work with the ECB to explore the central bank digital currency's payment functionalities and use cases, the release said.

The ECB issued a call to small and large merchants, banks and payment-service providers last year. The central bank's President Christine Lagarde said that the testing phase of the CBDC, which it calls its preparation phase, should end by October. A decision on whether or not to issue a digital euro is expected to occur after legislation takes effect.

The initiative is part of the ECB's broader efforts to explore the potential of a European central bank digital currency (CBDC) and support the creation of an innovative and inclusive digital payments ecosystem across the EU.







Following a call for interest published in October 2024, the ECB received over 100 applications from various market actors. Approximately 70 participants were selected to join one or both dedicated workstreams: pioneers and visionaries. These participants include banks, fintechs, merchants, startups, and other payment service providers.

The initiative is designed to simulate the digital euro ecosystem, with the ECB offering technical infrastructure and support to enable European intermediaries to explore and test digital euro functionalities. The platform aims to assess how the digital euro could integrate into existing payment systems and generate added value for end-users.



The “pioneers” workstream is primarily focused on investigating conditional or programmable payments – transactions that execute automatically when predefined criteria are fulfilled. These may include use cases such as releasing payment upon delivery confirmation for an online purchase.

Participants in the pioneers group are integrating simulated digital euro interfaces with their systems, with technical guidance from the ECB. This includes access to APIs and relevant documentation. Each participant is independently developing use cases and will deliver a report summarising their findings. The ECB will analyse these contributions to guide future technical and policy decisions on the digital euro.

The “visionaries” workstream is conducting research into how the digital euro could address broader societal challenges, including digital financial inclusion. Concepts under consideration include enabling access to digital euro wallets through widespread physical channels such as post offices, which could extend services to unbanked populations or individuals lacking digital access.

The platform represents a key step in the ECB's phased approach to launching a potential CBDC. By fostering collaboration with stakeholders across the payments and fintech sectors, the ECB aims to unlock the digital euro's potential to drive innovation, improve the payment experience for consumers, and support Europe's strategic autonomy in the digital finance space.

Opinion by: Simon Cain, contributor at Bitcoin Policy UK

Most jurisdictions globally are researching, developing or implementing retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). If you see these as harmless move-with-the-times digital updates of old-fashioned paper money, look again. CBDCs potentially mean financial serfdom via a monetary panopticon where the authorities closely control every transaction. 

If you think this sounds paranoid, just consider the words of Augustin Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements — the central bank for the world's central banks. Lamenting the authorities' current inability to control cash transactions, he says that with a CBDC, a “central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine use... also we will have the technology to enforce that.. that makes a huge difference with respect to what cash is.”

How “absolute control” might work

CBDCs could be programmed so you can only buy certain things from certain people, at certain times, within specific dates, or only in approved locations. Their validity could depend on compliance with all government policies (climate, medical, social, and tax). They could be subject to maximum or minimum holding limits. They could be programmed to discourage saving and encourage 'investing' in approved shares and bonds (such as the new EU 'SIU' initiative or in line with UK financial industry lobbying and 'research'). 

Politicians and central bankers may say they do not intend to implement any such controls, but such assurances are worthless. To quote the UK Parliament's own Economic Affairs Committee, ""while the Governor of the Bank of England told the committee that he did not see a CBDC as a way to implement monetary policy, the committee noted that his successors may disagree"".

Freedom to transact is fundamental to freedom itself. Once you can no longer choose what you do with your money, you're on the road to monetary serfdom. How can you defend yourself? 

Bitcoin fixes more than monetary serfdom 

Bitcoin fights financial subjugation. Because it's the world's most decentralized and censorship-resistant money, Bitcoin held in self-custody cannot be frozen or confiscated, and its transactions cannot be stopped. This isn't theoretical. It has already been proven in countless cases of financial repression all over the world, whether in Russia and Ukraine, Afghanistan and Cuba, or globally by organizations from WikiLeaks in 2011 to the Bitcoin Humanitarian Alliance in 2025. 

Recent: Is Bitcoin's future in circular economies or national reserves?

But financial serfdom isn't the only risk with CBDCs. The UK's Economic Affairs Committee also points out that ""a centralized CBDC ledger, which would be a critical piece of national infrastructure, could be a target for attack from hostile state and non-state actors."" Governments and public entities are always being hacked and leaking data, which they exacerbate by constantly hacking each other. Having your access to money entirely dependent on their competence is a terrible idea. 

Bitcoin fights financial institutional failure. And again, this isn't theoretical — it has also already been proven. When banks fail, or their systems go down, Bitcoin always remains up and running because it is the world's most reliable computer network. For well over a decade, Bitcoin has not been down for even a fraction of a second. 

Bitcoin is ultra-decentralized, and there have been zero successful hacks of the Bitcoin ledger itself during that period, despite its worth being in the trillions of dollars. Public or private, monetary or otherwise, no other large network can come close to this reliability and resistance to physical, virtual or political attack.

Nowhere is immune from digital fiat 

CBDCs look to be coming to the major Western economies. The European Central Bank is set to complete preparations for its 'digital euro' CBDC this year. Americans may now have a presidential order ""prohibiting… a CBDC within the jurisdiction of the United States,"" but stablecoins look set to become government CBDCs disguised in decentralized private-bank clothing, able to perform the same functions. 

The current US administration's enthusiasm for stablecoins is remarkably aligned with the favored CBDC framework of the BIS, ""a hybrid model which allows the division of labor between the central bank and private intermediaries."" For a peek into this potential stablecoin-as-CBDC world, just look at what being embedded in the US dollar system already means for the world's leading stablecoin. ""We follow US laws and regulations when it comes to freezing,"" says Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, which doesn't even operate inside the United States. ""We have on-boarded the FBI and US secret services; we work with the Department of Justice almost daily and the Treasury.""

Whether it's called a CBDC or not, you'll likely soon be subjected to some form of digital fiat. But, at present, there's nothing to stop you from accessing some self-sovereign 'outside-the-system' money. As permissionless peer-to-peer digital cash, Bitcoin can defend against monetary serfdom and protect from the failures of financial institutions. And, in its own sly roundabout way, it is the best and only truly decentralized tool for doing so.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","US Treasury report on stablecoins mulls upside of offering interest","https://www.ledgerinsights.com/us-treasury-report-on-stablecoins-mulls-upside-of-offering-interest/","Tue, 06 May 2025 12:17:24 GMT","

A presentation last week to the US Treasury's Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) explored the impact of stablecoins on the demand for short term Treasuries. One topic was mentioned repeatedly – the potential for stablecoins to offer interest. The last iteration of the Senate's stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, introduced a clause that banned the payment of stablecoin interest before receiving a positive vote by the Senate Banking Committee.

According to the minutes of the TBAC meeting, “There was robust discussion concerning the potential implications of interest bearing stablecoins versus non-interest bearing stablecoins, and the extent to which growth in stablecoins would result in net new demand for Treasury securities rather than a reallocation of demand from banks and money market mutual funds.” 

The President's Executive Order on digital assets made clear the intention to promote the use of US dollar stablecoins beyond US borders. White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks was very clear that the goal is to increase demand for US Treasuries, which helps to lower the cost of servicing the United States' massive debt.

The TBAC report used a figure from Standard Chartered research that estimates that stablecoins will grow to $2 trillion by 2028 assuming stablecoins don't pay interest. As an aside, Citi also recently published forecasts. The mid April capitalization of stablecoins was $234 billion, which accounts for approximately $120 billion investment in short-dated Treasuries. Combining that with Standard Chartered's figure, the report estimates that stablecoin investment in Treasuries will expand to $1 trillion by 2028. If stablecoins were to offer interest, the figure could be quite a bit higher, although no forecast was provided. That would account for a significant slice of the short term Treasury Bill market, which currently has a $6.4 trillion issuance. 

A key reason why most global stablecoin regulation has not supported the payment of interest is because there is a concern that bank deposits might shift to stablecoins, potentially affecting the economy with less credit available from banks, or credit might become more expensive. The TBAC report states that transactional  demand deposits at banks that total $6.6 trillion are most “at risk” from stablecoins.

However, the presentation spent just as much time exploring potential opportunities for banks and financial institutions, including issuing stablecoins and managing reserves.

Apart from delving into the potential for stablecoins to offer interest, two other issues were floated – the potential to allow stablecoin issuers access to the Federal Reserve and / or deposit insurance. This would help reduce the impact of de-peg events.

Readers of the TBAC report might expect to see efforts to remove the interest ban from the GENIUS Act. However, after this TBAC meeting, several pro-crypto Democrats withdrew support for the latest version of the GENIUS Act despite it still including the yield ban. Backtracking on the yield clause could further delay the progress of the stablecoin bill.

The UK government has ruled out creating national cryptocurrency reserves at the moment.  

Economic Secretary to the Treasury Emma Reynolds expressed negative sentiment towards a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve at the FT Digital Asset Summit in London. 

Responding to questions about whether the UK would follow the U.S. approach of holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet, Reynolds stated, “We don't think that's appropriate for our market.”

While dismissing the idea of crypto reserves, Reynolds signaled the UK's openness to leveraging blockchain technology for government finance. She revealed that the government is exploring the use of distributed ledger technology for sovereign debt issuance.

Reynolds, former parliamentary secretary at the Treasury, was appointed economic secretary following Tulip Siddiq's resignation. Reynolds was set to oversee the U.K.'s crypto regulation efforts and central bank digital currency plans. 

Her appointment came as the government continued pushing for stricter compliance in crypto while aiming to position the U.K. as a digital asset hub.

The remarks come amid closer digital asset cooperation between the UK and U.S. Reynolds pointed to recent discussions between the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and confirmed the formation of a “senior official level working group” focused on digital assets. 

The UK's stance highlights a divergence from the U.S. strategy on state-level crypto holdings while reinforcing alignment on regulation and DLT experimentation. 

Reynolds' comments reinforce the UK's cautious but active approach to integrating digital assets into its financial infrastructure.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Will Crypto Values Survive the Regulatory Wave?","https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/05/06/will-crypto-values-survive-the-regulatory-wave","Tue, 06 May 2025 14:34:18 GMT","

It is often said that crypto is part technology and part religion. As such, it is hardly surprising that the unfolding regulatory overhaul has been accompanied both by vigorous soul searching related to the state of crypto's (often anti-establishment) core values and palpable excitement over potential new use cases.

With the blessing of CoinDesk, I asked the panelists of our upcoming people's regulatory roundtable at Consensus 2025—each of them crypto veterans and advocates for sensible regulation—about safeguarding crypto values in regulatory reform and about the innovation that new regulation is making possible. 

You can catch Kayvan Sadeghi, Connor Spelliscy, Lewis Cohen, Michelle Ann Gitlitz and David Adlerstein speaking at the People's Regulatory Roundtable on May 14 at 10 a.m. on the Spotlight Stage. The roundtable will be moderated by Ivo Entchev. If you would like to submit a question ahead of time, please email it to opinion@coindesk.com.

This is what they had to say.



Which core crypto values are most important to you and why? How can we ensure that they are respected by regulatory reform?

KAYVAN: Individual freedom and sovereignty are core values. Privacy and decentralization are important largely as a means to achieving that sovereignty, which can otherwise be undermined through surveillance and centralized points of control.

To ensure that these values are respected, it is helpful to reframe the conversation to focus on the ways in which new technology can achieve the objectives of the existing laws, not just differently, but better. For example, many financial regulations are designed to prevent abuse by those with control over other people's assets. But as long as humans hold that power, the risk of corruption and greed will persist and the same problems will recur.

Heavily regulated intermediaries is one path, but removing the human intermediaries altogether can eliminate the root cause. By analogy, one can curtail drunk-driving with stricter alcohol laws and more frequent roadside checkpoints, but those are band-aids on a problem that can be eliminated with autonomous vehicles.

There will be growing pains as new technology is battle-tested, and the risks will look different from the risks of human intermediaries, but the values can be preserved by focusing the discussion around the use of technology to deliver better solutions to problems that the law is already trying to solve.



CONNOR: Blockchain technology can provide users with unprecedented levels of transparency, reliability, and security—as long as policy frameworks allow it to flourish by incentivizing decentralization.

If properly regulated, blockchain projects will continue to decentralize, giving users greater control over their finances and digital assets, reducing reliance on overreaching institutions. Beyond financial use cases, decentralized blockchain networks function as infrastructure for a variety of applications that provide users with more autonomy over their lives, including, for example: social media platforms that allow users to own and control their data, community-owned platforms that leverage decentralized governance to compete with Big Tech, and digital identity protocols necessary for users to protect their identity online from sophisticated AI-enabled bots.

We believe that focusing on control is the most effective framing option for defining decentralization under law. Meeting a test for control would significantly reduce information asymmetries stemming from the control of a blockchain's token, justifying lower regulatory burdens or exemptions under securities laws. We recommended specific control principles to implement in our Designing Blockchain for a Flourishing Industry paper we published this week, incorporating feedback from 40+ teams, founders, operators, lawyers, and policymakers.



LEWIS: When we talk about core values, I think about the values of those users and builders who are attracted to the crypto space, rather than the values of a technology as such. These individuals, in my experience, are attracted by many things that certainly include personal sovereignty and decentralization, but are by no means limited to these features.

What means the most to me and has driven me forward for the last 10 years, is working with, and serving the needs of, that incredibly diverse community of users and builders - fiercely dedicated to innovation and developing a new “Internet of Value.” We can never forget that, at its heart, “crypto” is a system of tools built from the ground up, not by large corporations, but by individuals contributing their time, energy, and creativity to help make the world a more connected and inclusive place.



MICHELLE: Decentralization is the most important value to me because the distribution of power, control, and decision-making across a network rather than in the hands of central authorities enables true digital ownership and freedom to transact. Where there is centralization and control, we need legal and regulatory safeguards that are reasonably tailored to the particular intricacies of the blockchain-based systems. Ensuring decentralization is respected requires legislators and regulators to truly understand the underlying infrastructure so they can craft rules that protect consumers from loss of funds or value and to safeguard against financial crimes.



DAVID: I've been a corporate lawyer for over 20 years and am an ardent believer in free markets. The concept of recognized rights in alienable property, the concept that entrepreneurs should be free to test ideas in the marketplace, and the concept of “freedom of contract”—that consenting adults should be free to enter into exchanges of goods and services as they desire—are all at the heart of U.S. corporate law (and that of other liberal democracies). These concepts are quintessential crypto values.



For all crypto's novelty, the paradigm of needing reasonable regulatory safeguards around a new technology is an old one. Commercial airplanes were once new tech, and for good reason we have regulations to ensure things like pilot training and safety standards, but these days you can pretty much fly anywhere whenever you want to.



The same paradigm should apply here. I believe it is possible for regulators to preserve openness to new software-based business models and organizational forms, while reasonably tailoring safeguards to prevent things like financial crises and terror financing.



Is regulation opening the door to new and valuable business models/products?



KAYVAN: Sensible regulation could have profound implications for any business driven by community engagement and network effects. Many technologies are lowering the barrier for individuals and small teams to generate and distribute content in competition with larger centralized companies. Effective regulation can further empower individuals by paving the way for good actors to have more direct access to allocation of capital, and for a broader mainstream audience to participate in the ecosystem and benefit from the network effects of the communities in which they participate.



CONNOR: To be determined! We've seen a lot more mainstream and institutional interest in blockchain technology now that it appears the space will have clearer parameters as laid out in legislation like a market structure and stablecoin bill but until those bills pass, I think many ambitious and exciting blockchain projects will continue to have a problem scaling. I'm optimistic we'll be seeing more impactful projects launch in areas like decentralized AI, digital identity, and social media. I'd also love to see legal clarity for novel organizational structures like DAOs so that those types of organizations can continue to experiment and improve; with respect to DAOs, the newly available Wyoming DUNA has proven to be a great step forward.



LEWIS: The door is always open to innovation! Regulation, when it works as it should, facilitates innovation in a balanced and sustainable manner, but is reactive to new business models that the community adopts and actually uses.



I think of regulations in their most ideal form as similar to the development of car travel. Innovators developed the automobile—“horseless carriages” which initially traveled along muddy trails intended for a very different kind of transportation. Seeing this innovation, the government paved and painted lines on roads. Yes, this constrained drivers to some extent, but it also allowed them to travel more safely and go much faster. It was the private sector that took the lead when it came to automobile innovation, designing new kinds of cars with new technologies that travel on those roads.



No matter how well intended at the time, any regulation that seeks to put its finger on the scale and promote one type of technology approach over another usually winds up backfiring in some way and distorting the market. Innovators will continue to create, and regulators should continue to watch over and adapt to these innovations, not lead them.



MICHELLE: I've been in the crypto industry for the last 10 years and have worked mostly in heavily regulated areas dealing with financial integrity and consumer protection. I've seen new business models and products such as stablecoins proliferate in the ecosystem in the absence of regulatory clarity. Thoughtful regulation enables wider adoption of innovative crypto products with greater confidence by providing clarity to developers and trust amongst users. I've also seen more projects in the crypto industry prioritize compliance compared to a decade ago.



As a result, there is a significant opportunity for RegTech solutions to build compliance tooling and processes. We do this every day at Change Agents where we are on a mission to streamline workflows, reduce costs and unlock efficiencies using our secure AI-powered automation first platform. Traditional financial institutions often operate on decades-old platforms that were not designed to interface with modern technologies. They struggle with fragmented data stored in disparate systems and formats. Jurisdictions maintain varying approaches to regulation, further complicating these issues.



Crypto platforms inherently facilitate compliance because blockchain technology enables transparent recordkeeping, more automated compliance checks and immutable audit trails. Crypto platforms are also developed with API-first approaches, making integration with RegTech products significantly more straightforward. Finally, crypto companies can oftentimes automate regulatory compliance functions directly from their transaction data rather than manually aggregating data from multiple systems, increasing delays and creating the potential for error. Ultimately, these factors give crypto companies a competitive edge over TradFi because they can better reduce compliance costs while also providing more accurate information to regulators.



DAVID: There are many powerful narratives within crypto, beginning with Bitcoin as a resilient store of value now over 16 years old borderline ancient for technology these days. But I'm particularly excited about stablecoins and tokenization of real-world assets. The potential impact of having a nexus between capital and a fully composable, Turing-complete global computer is not widely understood.



Money is the very lifeblood of commerce, and things like instantaneous payments with little friction and the ability of the unbanked to use digital dollar equivalents, to name just a couple of examples, are only the beginning. Stablecoins are already fairly popular, but impending U.S. regulation will open the door to much more widespread usage. It's critical to get stablecoin regulation right, with a particular emphasis on minimizing run risk, preserving the ability to combat illicit finance, and promoting interoperability.

The crypto market is back in the spotlight due to several important economic events. We asked Vugar Usi Zadeh, COO of one of the world's largest crypto exchanges, Bitget, to talk about them and draw conclusions about how the situation will develop further.

So, last week there were two big news items that somehow affected the market. This is the publication of macroeconomic data on the US labor market and quarterly reports of the largest technology corporations. And the main event of the week will be the conference of the head of the US Federal Reserve System Jerome Powell. Investors are not so much waiting for news as for tone — every intonation and wording can affect the markets.

These events certainly have the potential to significantly impact both Bitcoin's price and investor sentiment. Let's take a quick look at these news stories and see what potential impact they could have on the crypto industry.

Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon all posted record revenue and profits in the first quarter of 2025, despite economic challenges and the start of a trade war initiated by the Trump administration. The companies' combined revenue was $118.9 billion, up 29,2% year-over-year, and revenue grew 9,9% to $453.6 billion. The results underscored robust demand for cloud computing, digital advertising and AI-powered solutions.

The Non-Farm Payrolls report for April showed the creation of 177 thousand new jobs — more than analysts expected (160-165 thousand). Against this background, the dollar immediately strengthened, and a wave of volatility passed in the risk asset market, including cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin reacted immediately to the publication: traders began to close long positions, fearing a tighter Fed policy. After all, strong employment data is another argument in favor of keeping rates high for a long period.

Such news is often used as a trigger for price movement into a certain liquidity zone, but is not fundamental to the long-term trend in itself.

The main event of the week, as we already wrote, will be the conference of the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve System, Jerome Powell, this Wednesday.

Here are the main questions that will be answered:

These topics are interconnected: trade barriers can increase inflation risks, and slowing inflation can create room for looser monetary policy. So even Powell's supposedly neutral comments could cause volatility, especially in the crypto market, which remains extremely sensitive to signals from the Fed.

For experienced market participants, all this news is just «fuel» to move the price to the desired zones. «News do not move the market by themselves. It is a tool for delivering liquidity,» explains one of the traders I know from dev.ua.

Despite a possible BTC correction, there are still «live» sectors in the market. These are:

For traders, this may be a signal: even if BTC goes into correction, individual niches may remain profitable.

According to Eric Balchunas, US-focused ETFs have experienced strong inflows since Liberation Day, while Europe and China-focused ETFs have seen notable outflows. Broad international ETFs are performing well, but the technology sector is leading all others in capital attraction. These ETF flow trends highlight US market dominance and tech sector strength, which historically correlates with increased risk appetite and potential bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, especially for assets linked to US tech and broader digital innovation (source: Eric Balchunas on Twitter, May 6, 2025).

As bitcoin (BTC) and the wider crypto market await the Fed's rate decision on Wednesday, an anomaly has emerged that could weigh heavily on market mood: renewed doubt over the passing of U.S. crypto regulation.

Early Tuesday, CoinDesk reported that Senate Democrats are hesitant to push forward  landmark stablecoin legislation, citing concerns over President Donald Trump's growing personal gains from his crypto ventures.

When Trump took office, many observers felt crypto regulation would proceed smoothly. Looking back, that optimism was probably misplaced. With the president actively involved in digital assets through family-linked projects like WLFI and memecoins, opposition has mounted, potentially slowing the regulatory progress.

That might lead investors to reprice regulatory uncertainty just as charts for BTC and XRP are signaling pullback risks. Additionally, according to CryptoQuant, there are signs of renewed weakness in bitcoin demand from U.S.-based investors. 

""Over the past month, the premium recovered significantly but is now dropping again — aligning with the recent BTC price correction,"" CryptoQuant contributor AbramChart said.

On the positive side, U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) marked three straight days of net inflows.

Acting CFTC Chairman Caroline Pham told crypto journalist Eleanor Terret that the derivatives market regulator plans to observe a handful of tokenization pilot programs to evaluate the technology and see how well tokenized assets function in the real world.

Speaking of traditional markets and macro, Taiwan dollar forward contracts signal extreme pressure on the U.S. dollar, meaning the greenback could continue to weaken against the Asian currency and probably major currencies like the euro. The broad-based USD weakness may act as a tailwind for crypto. FX market volatility could drive investors to gold and perhaps bitcoin, too, unless it leads to a broad-based risk-off, in which case BTC may feel the heat.

The other bullish development is the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's comments that U.S. rates now carry sovereign credit risk and not just long-term growth and inflation expectations. In other words, rates are artificially high because the U.S. government itself is now the risk premium, as pseudonymous observer EndGame Macro said. So, a shift away from U.S. assets and into alternative investments could continue. Stay alert!

VIRTUAL, the native cryptocurrency of the Base-based Virtuals Protocol for creating and owning AI agents, has outperformed all major cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC), over the past four weeks. 

This rally is characterized by increased participation from the ""smart money"" wallets, according to on-chain data tracked by Nansen.

VIRTUAL has rallied 207% to $1.66 in 30 days to rank as the best performer among the top 100 tokens by market value, according to data source CoinDesk. Prices have risen 11% in the past seven days. Market leader bitcoin, meanwhile, has gained just 13% in four weeks, with flat performance over the past seven days.

VIRTUAL is also the most traded token by smart money—wallets identified by Nansen as owned by institutions, funds, and influential whales.

The token has attracted smart money inflows of $14.2 million over the past 30 days and $8.56 million in the past week. EBTC, LINK and PEPE are the other smart money favorites.

The table shows the top tokens traded - bought or sold on a DEX or sent/received from centralized exchanges - by smart money wallets. Per Nansen's explainer, the buying activity is represented in green and the selling activity in red.

VIRTUAL's leadership is likely led by excitement about the debut of the Genesis launchpad two weeks ago. The new system, designed to reward genuine contributors and not mere speculators, uses a ""proof of contribution"" points system, where participants earn Virgen points through activities like staking or staking AI projects.

""Since its debut, most tokens launched through it have 2x'd or more, fueling demand for Virgen Points and showing there's still room for creativity in token design,"" Bankless said on X.

Other key features of the new system include contribution-based allocations, automatic refunds if goals aren't met, and transparent vesting schedules.

""Genesis breathes fresh life into Virtuals while also showcasing a novel mechanism for designing token launches,"" Bankless said, adding that while the contribution-based system is not perfect, it certainly ""rivals"" who-knows-who or other primitive systems prone to manipulation.

Cardano's ADA and XRP led losses among majors on Tuesday as traders await the outcome of the upcoming Federal Reserve (FOMC) meeting, where rates are expected to stay unchanged but Fed chair Jerome Powell's comments could provide cues on further market positioning.

Bitcoin (BTC) prices held above $94,000 after briefly dipping below that level on Sunday, continuing its recent range-bound behavior.

ADA price dropped nearly 4% while XRP slid similarly. Ether (ETH) fell nearly 1%, BNB Chain's BNB rose 1.3% and memecoin dogecoin (DOGE) was down 2% in the past 24 hours.

The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index that tracks the largest tokens by market capitalization, dropped a little over 1.8%.

Elsewhere, some DeFi tokens such as AAVE, Curve's CRV, and Hyperliquid's HYPE have seen a bump in demand over the past week in a sign of trader interest toward projects with utility and yield mechanisms, some say.

“As memecoins fall out of favor, traders are turning to projects with stronger fundamentals and token economics,” said Kay Lu, CEO of HashKey Eco Labs, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. 

“DeFi ecosystems are benefiting from this pivot, especially as Bitcoin shows decreased volatility and macro uncertainty lingers. We're hopeful to see the DeFi trend continue as Bitcoin maintains decreased volatility and crypto acts as a hedge for economic uncertainty,” Lu added.

HYPE led gains among the top 100 tokens with a 72% surge in the past week, with AAVE and CRV up as much as 40%.

Traders across both crypto and traditional finance markets are eyeing this week's FOMC interest rate decision, with consensus expectations pointing to a pause in rate hikes.

However, uncertainty around inflation, tariffs, and the broader U.S.–China trade tensions has left many participants cautious.

“We don't expect the FOMC to trigger a major move in markets,” said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, in a Telegram message. “It's a coin flip on direction. Crypto will likely take cues from broader earnings growth and how the economy digests the impact of recent trade policies.”

Recent stock market strength suggests that investors are pricing in only a mild recession risk, around 8%, according to historical drawdown models. That contrasts with more bearish signals from bond markets and macroeconomic forecasts, Fan added.

Last week, President Trump confirmed no immediate plans for talks with China, dampening hopes for a breakthrough in U.S.–China trade negotiations. Still, the possibility of separate trade agreements has helped keep risk sentiment intact, as reported Monday.

Banking giant Citi and SIX Digital Exchange (SDX), the digital assets-focused arm of Switzerland's main stock exchange, are teaming up to tokenize non-publicly traded shares in a move to streamline a $75 billion market that's littered with PDFs and paper documents.

Citi will act as a custodian and issuer agent for tokenized versions of late stage, pre-IPO equities on SDX's regulated blockchain-based Central Securities Depository (CSD) platform, the companies said on Tuesday.

Citi said the platform, which is expected to go live in the third quarter, will exclude U.S. investors, but is otherwise global with an initial focus on Switzerland, Singapore and other parts of Asia.

Private shares in high-growth, venture-backed companies are a large and appealing subset of an alternative asset class that's valued in the trillions of dollars. 

Firms with valuations of a billion dollars and more are remaining private for longer as market conditions dictate delays in IPOs for many. That means the companies are looking to secondary markets to help investors and employees get liquidity. But there's an access problem, and the transactions themselves are manual and cumbersome.

“The most notable characteristic of private markets is that there is no infrastructure, at least nothing scalable,” Nisha Surendran, digital asset emerging solutions lead at Citi Ventures, said in an interview.

Investors are typically faced with a daunting set of PDFs and paper documents to get through, and the settlement of a transaction can take from five to eight weeks — a process that has to be repeated when the investor wants to exit the position, Surendran explained.

“These investments are also hampered by the fact they don't flow into investors' wealth statements like other public securities do. Rather, they end up encapsulated in PDFs or paper documents or on other platforms,” she said.

While recent years have seen many traditional financial institutions looking at the tokenization of real-world assets, the very early days of this trend saw lots of attention focused on blockchain-enabled private markets, but with little actually delivered.

SDX CEO David Newns said many hopeful Web3 projects, which saw blockchain rails as a way to streamline outdated processes and enable easy access and distribution for private markets, came up against regulatory hurdles.

“There's a very mature digital-securities regulatory environment in Switzerland where we've been doing this now since 2021,” Newns said in an interview. “That isn't the case elsewhere. The technology may have looked like it could address all the challenges, but problems around distribution, holding the instrument, and what that instrument represents legally from an investment perspective were not really solved.”

SDX's blockchain-based securities depository is built on R3's Corda distributed ledger technology. Investors get access through the dematerialized securities legal construct in Switzerland, via their broker and custodian, Newns said.

“It means effectively, they turn up in your bank account in the same way that a normal security does,” he said. “It doesn't require that you as an investor do anything special to access these investment instruments.”

The announcement also marks Citi becoming a custodian on SDX, a move that reflects the bank's strategy to provide clients with access to new digital asset markets globally including to private market assets, said Nadine Teychenne, Citi's global head of digital assets, investor services and issuer services.

“This is part of a joined-up project across multiple businesses at Citi,” Teychenne said in an interview.

Digital asset banking group Sygnum and Singapore-based financial institution SBI Digital Markets will help with access to the pre-IPO equities that Citi will bring onto the SDX platform, according to a press release.

 Changpeng Zhao expects Bitcoin to reach between $500,000 and $1 million this market cycle, driven by institutional adoption, growing government accumulation and a pro-crypto US policy. 

Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao expects Bitcoin's price to top at $500,000 to $1 million during this market cycle.

During an interview with Rug Radio published on May 5, Zhao said that he expects Bitcoin to reach up to one million dollars during this market cycle. He also highlighted the role of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in this rise, saying that the increasing institutionalization of Bitcoin is a good thing for the market:

Zhao explained that the ETFs are “bringing the traditional institution money into crypto” and “most of the money in the US is institutional money.” He said that “Bitcoin is going up because most of the ETFs are Bitcoin-based.”

Founder of Obchakevich Research Alex Obchakevich told Cointelegraph that “70% [of Bitcoin's growth] is new institutional capital, the rest is just a redistribution of crypto assets.” He highlighted the role of the ETFs in pushing Bitcoin's price higher:

Zhao also highlighted that governments are increasingly buying Bitcoin as well, which “is really good for the price action.” He added:

The remarks follow multiple countries accumulating Bitcoin. In late April, El Salvador, the world's first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, continued acquiring Bitcoin despite the International Monetary Fund's comments claiming the opposite. In the seven days leading to April 27, the country acquired 7 BTC worth over $650,000 at the time.

The country's Bitcoin Office data shows that El Salvador currently holds nearly 6,170 BTC worth almost $580 million. The Kingdom of Bhutan is also accumulating Bitcoin. January reports suggested that a new economic hub in the country plans to set up a strategic cryptocurrency reserve comprising major crypto assets, including Bitcoin and Ether (ETH).

The former Binance CEO also noted that the US “has pivoted 180 degrees under a pro-crypto president,” since the election of President Donald Trump. He said:

Talking about retail investors, he said that they “had 15 years to buy.” Consequently, “if they're late now, that was their choice.”

 Mashinsky pleaded guilty in December 2024 to commodities fraud and manipulating the price of CEL, earning $48 million by selling his holdings before Celsius collapsed. 

Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of bankrupt crypto lending platform Celsius, has blasted the government's 20-year “venom-laced” sentence request, declaring it a “death-in-prison sentence.”

The US Department of Justice requested Mashinsky receive at least 20 years behind bars in the May 8 sentencing for his role in misleading Celsius users and profiting from the price manipulation of Celsius (CEL), which would make the 59-year-old 79 if he serves the whole sentence.

Lawyers acting for Mashinsky argued in a May 5 reply memorandum filed in a New York district court that he should receive no more than 366 days, because the DOJ hasn't taken into account his status as a nonviolent first-time offender with a previously unblemished 30-year history in business.  

“The government's venom-laced submission recasts this case as one involving a predator with an intent to target victims, harm them, and steal their money,” they said.

“It concludes by recommending that a first time, nonviolent offender who pled guilty and accepts responsibility receive a death-in-prison sentence.”

As part of a plea agreement, Mashinsky pleaded guilty in December 2024 to commodities fraud and manipulating the price of CEL, earning $48 million by selling his holdings before Celsius collapsed in June 2022. Prosecutors initially filed seven charges in July 2023.

Lawyers acting for Mashinsky allege the DOJ's push for a 20-year sentence is because their client is unwilling to “capitulate to the government's exaggerated characterizations of his actions,” specifically that he was a “fraud from the get-go.” 

“Alex is inserted as the scapegoat for every corporate action, every group decision, every unanimous vote, every market fluctuation, and every employee's watercooler speculation,” they said.

As part of its April 28 sentencing request, the DOJ said Mashinsky's guilty plea showed that his crimes were deliberate, calculated decisions to lie, deceive and steal.

Days earlier on April 23, US federal prosecutors also filed statements from hundreds of victims who lost money due to the Celsius collapse. They detailed how some had entrusted their life savings to the protocol, believing Mashinsky's assurances that it was safe.

Related: What do crypto users want to happen to Alex Mashinsky?

Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 13, 2022, owing $4.7 billion to creditors after halting withdrawals in June, citing volatile market conditions.

In November 2023, a US bankruptcy court approved Celsius' restructuring plan to repay customers, and in August 2024, $2.53 billion was paid to 251,000 creditors.

Former Celsius chief revenue officer Roni Cohen-Pavon also pleaded guilty in September 2023 to similar charges, but his Dec. 11 sentencing has been delayed until after Mashinsky is sentenced.

 Florida's House Bill 487 and Senate Bill 550 have been “indefinitely postponed and withdrawn from consideration.” 

Two Florida crypto bills have been removed from the legislative process in the latest blow to American state-level strategic Bitcoin reserve ambitions. 

Florida's House Bill 487 and Senate Bill 550 have been “indefinitely postponed and withdrawn from consideration” on May 3, according to the Florida Senate. 

Florida's legislative session adjourned on May 2 without the passage of these two bills, which would have advanced legislation to establish a crypto reserve for the state. The Senate and House agreed to extend the session until June 6 to address budget plans. 

Lawmakers passed about 230 bills during the session, dealing with things like prohibiting putting fluoride in the water, protecting state parks, and a school smartphone ban, but diversifying state treasury portfolios was not among them. 

HB 487, which was introduced in February, would have allowed Florida's chief financial officer and the State Board of Administration to invest up to 10% of certain state funds into Bitcoin (BTC).

SB 550 was also filed in February to enable investments of public funds in Bitcoin.

Florida has now dropped out of the race to pass state-level crypto investment legislation, along with Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana and Oklahoma, which have all seen Bitcoin bills fail to pass House or Senate votes, according to Bitcoin Laws. 

It came just days after Arizona advanced its strategic Bitcoin reserve legislation further than any other state, until House Bill 1025 was vetoed by Governor Katie Hobbs, who labelled digital assets “untested investments” on May 3.

The Digital Assets Strategic Reserve bill would have permitted Arizona to invest seized funds into Bitcoin and create a reserve managed by state officials. 

The move drew the ire of crypto advocates and Bitcoiners, including entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano, who said: “Imagine the ignorance of a politician to believe they can make investment decisions.”

“Arizona has two more chances to be the first in the nation to establish a Bitcoin reserve,” said Satoshi Action Fund founder Dennis Porter on May 5, citing an article from Fox's Eleanor Terrett. 

He added that the most likely to pass is HB 2749, which offers a budget-neutral method to fund the reserve using profit from the unclaimed property fund.

There is also a related bill, SB 1373, which would authorize the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of Arizona state funds into digital assets. It has yet to reach a final vote.

 Mercuryo CEO Petr Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that with crypto salaries becoming a growing trend, there's an increasing need for ways to spend crypto. 

Petr Kozyakov, CEO of crypto payments platform Mercuryo, told Cointelegraph that the future of finance may not be a winner-takes-all scenario but a blend of digital assets and fiat, each used where it makes the most sense. 

In a Cointelegraph interview, Kozyakov said that while crypto payments are seeing an increase in adoption and demand, the asset class won't be fully replacing fiat money anytime soon. He said the two asset classes will coexist, with people choosing the more convenient payment option in different situations. 

“We don't think crypto will replace fiat,” Kozyakov told Cointelegraph. “They will coexist, and people will turn to crypto when it's the easier, more practical option, whether that's for payroll, yield or money transfers.”

Crypto as a salary payment option is no longer a novelty. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that more companies are settling employee salaries with crypto assets. 

“That is a growing trend,” Kozyakov said. “I see a lot of businesses that are starting to settle with their full-time employees and with their gig employees all over the world, in crypto.”

As more employees receive crypto salaries, new challenges can emerge. According to Kozyakov, workers paid in crypto may ask what they can do next with their funds. “You won't invest everything and just wait. You need to use it for everyday purchases,” Kozyakov told Cointelegraph. 

This is where practical spending options are needed. Kozyakov said that crypto earners are looking for ways to use their digital asset incomes in daily life scenarios, whether buying coffee, going out for drinks or settling utility bills. 

As crypto becomes an option for employee salaries, there has also been a growing acceptance of crypto in employee contracts in some jurisdictions. In August 2024, a Dubai court recognized crypto as a valid form of salary payment.

The executive also told Cointelegraph that Mercuryo views crypto as more than just a speculative asset but a powerful tool for moving and storing value. “Crypto is not only an asset; it's the perfect rail to move money and store money. And it is essential to be able to spend it.”

The executive said that in practice, spending crypto can still be complex. He said it takes a few steps, including moving it to an exchange, sending it to a bank account and answering “weird” questions from banks. 

Because of this, he highlighted a need for easier ways to spend crypto directly. The executive said that this is where their company comes in. On April 23, the payment services firm collaborated with the hardware wallet company Ledger on a crypto payment card that allows users to spend crypto where Mastercard payments are accepted. 

Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that seamless crypto payment options will drive wider crypto adoption, not just as an investment, but as a true medium of exchange for daily life.

These Fish and Flies Are Engineered to Break Down Mercury

Bacterial genes protect animals—and their predators—from harmful contamination

By Cody Cottier edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Danio rerio, a freshwater zebra fish, is one species scientists have modified to filter mercury from the environment.

For decades mercury has been settling into lakes and oceans, where it builds up relentlessly in fish and everything that eats them—humans included. This pollution, which exposes millions of people to a toxic substance that can damage neural and reproductive health, “always seemed like such an intractable thing,” says Kate Tepper, a postdoctoral researcher at Australia's Macquarie University.

To try to make a dent in this problem, Tepper and her colleagues genetically engineered zebra fish and fruit flies so that they convert methylmercury—the kind that “bioaccumulates,” binding to muscle tissue and becoming more concentrated as it moves up the food chain—into the less harmful elemental mercury, which evaporates from the body as gas.

The researchers injected fish and fly embryos with Escherichia coli genes that produce a conversion enzyme. As the scientists report in Nature Communications, the modified zebra fish contained 64 percent less mercury than their unmodified counterparts, and the fruit flies had 83 percent less. The study authors propose that small, mercury-resistant fish could serve as a self-purifying foundation for the food chain, shielding larger fish, birds and humans. Modified insects, meanwhile, could remove mercury from the environment as they munch on sewage and fishery offal in enclosed facilities.

Tepper's team isn't the first to advocate bioremediation, the use of biological processes to clean up contamination. Previous research has shown that plants with certain bacterial genes (as well as the bacteria themselves) are powerful detoxifiers. But those organisms can't reach the pollutants already inside fish. By equipping animals with these enzymes, Tepper says, “you're targeting mercury in the place where it's causing the most toxicity.”

University of Connecticut marine scientist Robert Mason, who studies mercury in aquatic systems and was not involved in the study, says modified animals could help disrupt bioaccumulation on a local scale. But he sees a limitation, even for small-scale cleanups: elemental mercury can change back into methylmercury once it is released into the atmosphere. Facilities where insects process organic waste could be filtered to capture mercury, but with fish a solution would be less straightforward.

Mason and Tepper agree the fish would ideally be introduced at highly contaminated sites. Tepper hopes they can stock lakes near mercury hotspots created by artisanal gold mining in Africa, Indonesia and the Amazon—regions where many people rely on subsistence fishing.

But first the researchers need safety measures to constrain the genetically modified organisms. Tepper envisions eventual field trials in small lakes, possibly with sterilized fish, so scientists can test for unintended ecological effects in a controlled setting.

Such trials are years away. But someday, Tepper suggests, many nasty substances (such as microplastics, pharmaceuticals and PFAS) could perhaps be neutralized with the tweak of a genome. “It's proof of concept for engineering animals for bioremediation,” she says. “Potentially you could use this for a lot of pollutants.”

In a first-of-its-kind clinical study, scientists at The University of Texas at Dallas and Baylor University Medical Center showed that patients with treatment-resistant PTSD were symptom-free up to six months after completing traditional therapy paired with vagus nerve stimulation (VNS).

The results of the nine-patient Phase 1 trial, conducted by scientists from UT Dallas' Texas Biomedical Device Center (TxBDC) in collaboration with researchers from the Baylor Scott & White Research Institute (BSWRI), were published online March 15 in Brain Stimulation.

Dr. Michael Kilgard, the Margaret Fonde Jonsson Professor of neuroscience in the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences, said the outcome highlighted the potential of this approach.

""In a trial like this, some subjects usually do get better, but rarely do they lose their PTSD diagnosis. Typically, the majority will have this diagnosis for the rest of their lives,"" Kilgard said. ""In this case, we had 100% loss of diagnosis. It's very promising.""

Prolonged exposure therapy -- a component of traditional PTSD treatment -- is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy, conducted in a safe and supportive environment, that involves individuals gradually confronting thoughts, memories and situations they have avoided since experiencing a trauma.

In the study, scientists paired this therapy with concurrent delivery of short bursts of stimulation of the vagus nerve via a small device implanted in a participant's neck. After a standard 12-session therapy course, assessments were performed four times during the six months after its conclusion. Benefits persisted during that time for all nine participants.

The study is the largest clinical trial to date using an implanted device for the treatment of PTSD, Kilgard said.

Pioneering work by TxBDC researchers has demonstrated previously that VNS paired with physical rehabilitation can accelerate neuroplasticity -- the rewiring of areas of the brain. Their 13-year effort to treat a wide variety of conditions using VNS has resulted in approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating impaired upper-limb movement in stroke patients.

""The common theme in our VNS work is that we're taking therapies that show potential, like prolonged exposure therapy for PTSD, and making them work better,"" he said.

The National Center for PTSD, part of the Department of Veterans Affairs, estimates that 5% of adults in the U.S. have post-traumatic stress disorder in any given year, and that women are twice as likely to develop PTSD at some point in their life. Many PTSD patients fail to respond to therapy or pharmacological intervention, or experience intolerable side effects or relapse, leaving them with no viable prospect for remission.

Kilgard said that PTSD patients are not only found among military veterans, but also among average citizens who have faced traumatic events.

""When you hear PTSD, you may picture a combat zone, but it's much more prevalent than that,"" he said. ""It can stem from any event that inspires fear of death or bodily injury, or death of a loved one.""

Co-corresponding author Dr. Seth Hays, associate professor of bioengineering in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science and director of preclinical research at the TxBDC, has been a part of the VNS project since its earliest studies.

""It's been an incredibly rewarding experience to see this technology evolve from early discovery experiments in the lab to clinical benefits in patients,"" Hays said. ""This whole process truly highlights the value of team-based science.""

More than a decade ago, Dr. Robert Rennaker, professor of neuroscience and the Texas Instruments Distinguished Chair in Bioengineering, began to design an innovative implantable VNS device that was much smaller and less expensive than devices already on the market. The most recent wireless version of the device is about the size of a dime.

""The technology we have is above and beyond anything else that's out there. The device is about 50 times smaller than our version from just three years ago,"" he said. ""The 49 people in the Dallas area with our devices have a combined 100 years of experience with it implanted. There have been no issues; the devices are all still functioning. And they don't interfere with typical medical care; you can have an MRI, a CT scan or an ultrasound.""

The next step in the PTSD research -- a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 pilot study -- is ongoing in Dallas and Austin.

""We hope that it will represent another step toward FDA approval of a treatment that doesn't exist now, and it would be invented, tested and delivered by UT Dallas, as was the case for upper-limb recovery after stroke,"" Kilgard said.

Licensed clinical psychologist Dr. Mark Powers, a research center director of the Trauma Research Center at BSWRI, is the lead and co-corresponding author of the study. Driven by his desire to improve quality of life among people who experience psychological trauma, Powers said that VNS has ""changed the game"" by improving both treatment efficacy and its tolerability.

""VNS has changed my work dramatically,"" he said. ""Our gold-standard treatments for PTSD have about an 85% response rate, with 40% no longer having their diagnosis, and a 20% dropout rate. Soon we could have the option of VNS for people who don't get better with cognitive behavioral therapy alone.""

Powers added that his collaboration with UTD has a multidisciplinary synergy that he regards as rare.

""With this alliance, we have people doing the preclinical and the clinical work at the same time, giving each other feedback and ideas,"" he said. ""Neither one of our groups could do this alone.""

Other UTD-affiliated study authors included Dr. Jane Wigginton, medical director and co-director of the UT Dallas Clinical and Translational Research Center; Amy Porter MBA'20, TxBDC director of operations; and Holle Carey Gallaway MBA'23, TxBDC research biomedical engineer. Researchers from Southern Methodist University, UT Austin and Baylor Scott & White Health also contributed to the study.

The research was funded by a grant (N66001-15-2-4057) from the Biological Technologies Office at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, part of the Department of Defense.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Accordion effect makes graphene stretchable","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250506105353.htm","Tue, 06 May 2025 16:34:33 GMT","

Graphene is a ""miracle material"": mechanically extremely strong and electrically highly conductive, ideal for related applications. Using a worldwide unique method physicists at the University of Vienna led by Jani Kotakoski have for the first time made graphene drastically more stretchable by rippling it like an accordion. This paves the way for new applications in which certain stretchability is required (e.g. wearable electronics). In a collaboration with the Vienna University of Technology the exact mechanism of this phenomenon has been revealed and published in the journal Physical Review Letters.

The first experimental evidence of graphene in 2004 established a completely new class of materials, the so-called two-dimensional (2D) solids. Their name stems from the fact that they are only a single layer of atoms thick, giving rise to exotic material properties that could benefit various areas of application. Graphene for example stands out with its enormous electrical conductivity, but it is also very stiff. This extreme stiffness is a result of the honeycomb-shaped arrangement of the atoms in the material. Intuitively, the removal of some atoms from the material alongside their bonds should lead to a reduction in stiffness. However, scientific studies have reported both a slight reduction as well as a significant increase.

These contradictions have now been clarified through new measurements conducted by researchers of the group led by Jani Kotakoski at the University of Vienna. The experiments were carried out with state-of-the-art devices all sharing the same ultra-clean airless environment. This allows transporting samples between the different devices without ever being exposed to ambient air. ""This unique system we have developed in the University of Vienna allows us to examine 2D materials without interference,"" explains Jani Kotakoski. Wael Joudi, first author of the study adds: ""For the first time this kind of experiment has been carried out with the graphene fully isolated from ambient air and the foreign particles it contains. Without this separation, these particles would quickly settle on the surface affecting the experiment procedure and measurements.""

In fact, the focus on meticulous cleanliness of the material surface led to the discovery of the so-called accordion effect with regard to the stiffness of graphene: already the removal of two neighbouring atoms leads to discernible bulging of the initially flat material. Several bulges together result in a corrugation of the material: ""You can imagine it like an accordion. When pulled apart, the waved material now gets flattened, which requires much less force than stretching the flat material and therefore it becomes more stretchable,"" explains Wael Joudi. Simulations carried out by the theoretical physicists Rika Saskia Windisch and Florian Libisch from the Vienna University of Technology confirm both the formation of waves and the resulting stretchability.

The experiments also showed that foreign particles on the material surface not only supress this effect, but lead to the opposite result. Specifically, their influence makes the material appear stiffer, which also explains contradictions of the past. ""This shows the importance of the measurement environment when dealing with 2D materials. The results open up a way to regulate the stiffness of graphene and thus pave the way for potential applications,"" concludes Wael Joudi.

The research was funded in whole or in part by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Text-to-video AI blossoms with new metamorphic video capabilities","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250505170633.htm","Tue, 06 May 2025 01:17:48 GMT","

While text-to-video artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's Sora are rapidly metamorphosing in front of our eyes, they have struggled to produce metamorphic videos. Simulating a tree sprouting or a flower blooming is harder for AI systems than generating other types of videos because it requires the knowledge of the physical world and can vary widely.

But now, these models have taken an evolutionary step.

Computer scientists at the University of Rochester, Peking University, University of California, Santa Cruz, and National University of Singapore developed a new AI text-to-video model that learns real-world physics knowledge from time-lapse videos. The team outlines their model, MagicTime, in a paper published in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence.

""Artificial intelligence has been developed to try to understand the real world and to simulate the activities and events that take place,"" says Jinfa Huang, a PhD student supervised by Professor Jiebo Luo from Rochester's Department of Computer Science, both of whom are among the paper's authors. ""MagicTime is a step toward AI that can better simulate the physical, chemical, biological, or social properties of the world around us.""

Previous models generated videos that typically have limited motion and poor variations. To train AI models to more effectively mimic metamorphic processes, the researchers developed a high-quality dataset of more than 2,000 time-lapse videos with detailed captions.

Currently, the open-source U-Net version of MagicTime generates two-second, 512 -by- 512-pixel clips (at 8 frames per second), and an accompanying diffusion-transformer architecture extends this to ten-second clips. The model can be used to simulate not only biological metamorphosis but also buildings undergoing construction or bread baking in the oven.

But while the videos generated are visually interesting and the demo can be fun to play with, the researchers view this as an important step toward more sophisticated models that could provide important tools for scientists.

""Our hope is that someday, for example, biologists could use generative video to speed up preliminary exploration of ideas,"" says Huang. ""While physical experiments remain indispensable for final verification, accurate simulations can shorten iteration cycles and reduce the number of live trials needed.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New molecular label could lead to simpler, faster tuberculosis tests","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250505170649.htm","Tue, 06 May 2025 01:37:51 GMT","

Tuberculosis, the world's deadliest infectious disease, is estimated to infect around 10 million people each year, and kills more than 1 million annually. Once established in the lungs, the bacteria's thick cell wall helps it to fight off the host immune system.

Much of that cell wall is made from complex sugar molecules known as glycans, but it's not well-understood how those glycans help to defend the bacteria. One reason for that is that there hasn't been an easy way to label them inside cells.

MIT chemists have now overcome that obstacle, demonstrating that they can label a glycan called ManLAM using an organic molecule that reacts with specific sulfur-containing sugars. These sugars are found in only three bacterial species, the most notorious and prevalent of which is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the microbe that causes TB.

After labeling the glycan, the researchers were able to visualize where it is located within the bacterial cell wall, and to study what happens to it throughout the first few days of tuberculosis infection of host immune cells.

The researchers now hope to use this approach to develop a diagnostic that could detect TB-associated glycans, either in culture or in a urine sample, which could offer a cheaper and faster alternative to existing diagnostics. Chest X-rays and molecular diagnostics are very accurate but are not always available in developing nations where TB rates are high. In those countries, TB is often diagnosed by culturing microbes from a sputum sample, but that test has a high false negative rate, and it can be difficult for some patients, especially children, to provide a sputum sample. This test also requires many weeks for the bacteria to grow, delaying diagnosis.

""There aren't a lot of good diagnostic options, and there are some patient populations, including children, who have a hard time giving samples that can be analyzed. There's a lot of impetus to develop very simple, fast tests,"" says Laura Kiessling, the Novartis Professor of Chemistry at MIT and the senior author of the study.

MIT graduate student Stephanie Smelyansky is the lead author of the paper, which appears this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Other authors include Chi-Wang Ma, an MIT postdoc; Victoria Marando PhD '23; Gregory Babunovic, a postdoc at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health; So Young Lee, an MIT graduate student; and Bryan Bryson, an associate professor of biological engineering at MIT.

Labeling glycans

Glycans are found on the surfaces of most cells, where they perform critical functions such as mediating communication between cells. In bacteria, glycans help the microbes to enter host cells, and they also appear to communicate with the host immune system, in some cases blocking the immune response.

""Mycobacterium tuberculosis has a really elaborate cell envelope compared to other bacteria, and it's a rich structure that's composed of a lot of different glycans,"" Smelyansky says. ""Something that's often underappreciated is the fact that these glycans can also interact with our host cells. When our immune cells recognize these glycans, instead of sending out a danger signal, it can send the opposite message, that there's no danger.""

Glycans are notoriously difficult to tag with any kind of probe, because unlike proteins or DNA, they don't have distinctive sequences or chemical reactivities that can be targeted. And unlike proteins, they are not genetically encoded, so cells can't be genetically engineered to produce sugars labeled with fluorescent tags such as green fluorescent protein.

One of the key glycans in M. tuberculosis, known as ManLAM, contains a rare sugar known as MTX, which is unusual in that it has a thioether -- a sulfur atom sandwiched between two carbon atoms. This chemical group presented an opportunity to use a small-molecule tag that had been previously developed for labeling methionine, an amino acid that contains a similar group.

The researchers showed that they could use this tag, known as an oxaziridine, to label ManLAM in M. tuberculosis. The researchers linked the oxaziridine to a fluorescent probe and showed that in M. tuberculosis, this tag showed up in the outer layer of the cell wall. When the researchers exposed the label to Mycobacterium smegmatis, a related bacterium that does not cause disease and does not have the sugar MTX, they saw no fluorescent signal.

""This is the first approach that really selectively allows us to visualize one glycan in particular,"" Smelyansky says.

Better diagnostics

The researchers also showed that after labeling ManLAM in M. tuberculosis cells, they could track the cells as they infected immune cells called macrophages. Some tuberculosis researchers had hypothesized that the bacterial cells shed ManLAM once inside a host cell, and that those free glycans then interact with the host immune system. However, the MIT team found that the glycan appears to remain in the bacterial cell walls for at least the first few days of infection.

""The bacteria still have their cell walls attached to them. So it may be that some glycan is being released, but the majority of it is retained on the bacterial cell surface, which has never been shown before,"" Smelyansky says.

The researchers now plan to use this approach to study what happens to the bacteria following treatment with different antibiotics, or immune stimulation of the macrophages. It could also be used to study in more detail how the bacterial cell wall is assembled, and how ManLAM helps bacteria get into macrophages and other cells.

""Having a handle to follow the bacteria is really valuable, and it will allow you to visualize processes, both in cells and in animal models, that were previously invisible,"" Kiessling says.

She also hopes to use this approach to create new diagnostics for tuberculosis. There is currently a diagnostic in development that uses antibodies to detect ManLAM in a urine sample. However, this test only works well in patients with very active cases of TB, especially people who are immunosuppressed because of HIV or other conditions.

Using their small-molecule sensor instead of antibodies, the MIT team hopes to develop a more sensitive test that could detect ManLAM in the urine even when only small quantities are present.

The research was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Croucher Fellowship.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","How hunting harriers home in on their prey","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250506105359.htm","Tue, 06 May 2025 16:46:16 GMT","

Owls, well adapted to hearing the exact location of prey, have something in common with an unrelated group of raptors -- harriers.

A new study led by Canadian and Australian researchers has found that harriers across the world are able to keep a much better ear out for their next meal than previously thought.

The international team of University of Lethbridge and Flinders University researchers made the discovery when they found unexpected owl-like traits in the ear and brain of several harrier species, such as the Australian spotted harrier.

The new article published in Journal of Anatomy features the work of the Iwaniuk Lab at the University of Lethbridge in Alberta and Associate Professor Vera Weisbecker's 'Bones and Diversity Lab' at Flinders University in South Australia.

University of Lethbridge PhD student Sara Citron, who led the study, says owls have fine-tuned hearing abilities, allowing some of their species to locate prey in complete darkness.

""Until recently, it was assumed that all their hearing adaptations were unique to owls. However, our study shows that harriers have independently evolved several key adaptations for finding prey by sound,"" she says.

The research team focused on harriers -- a group of hawks found in North America, Australia, NZ, Europe, and parts of Africa and Asia -- because they show some unusual, owl-like hunting behaviours.

Senior author and PhD supervisor Dr Andrew Iwaniuk, Associate Professor at the Canadian Centre for Behavioural Neuroscience, says: ""Hawks tend to hunt primarily by sight. But unlike other hawks, harriers fly low over tall grass with their beak pointed to the ground.

""During this so-called 'quartering flight', they are not only looking for prey, they are also listening for it,"" he says.

Co-author Aubrey Keirnan, a PhD student at Flinders University who is also co-supervised by Dr Iwaniuk and Associate Professor Weisbecker, says that simply by looking at the harrier, you can see similarities with owls.

""The Australian Spotted Harrier is a great example,"" she says. ""When you look at this species' face, you can see a distinctive disc-shaped face, which may improve their prey localisation just like owls.""

The discovery matches older behavioural studies showing that harriers can locate sounds with similar accuracy to owls, but how they did this has been a mystery.

Using specimens from wildlife rehabilitators and museums in Australia and Canada, the team examined the anatomy of the skull and brain of harriers and other closely related hawk species such as the wedge-tailed eagle.

They found that, like owls, harriers have enlarged ear openings and two expanded brain regions that are essential for calculating where a sound is coming from.

""These auditory nuclei are found in the brainstem and compare the time at which sounds arrive at the left or right ear,"" says co-author Associate Professor in evolutionary biology Vera Weisbecker, from Flinders University's College of Science and Engineering.

""If a sound arrives at both ears at the same time, then the sound is coming from directly in front of an animal. If there is a delay, this indicates that the prey is more to the left or right,"" she says.

""By having these two brain regions expanded, harriers can make such computations more accurately than other hawks, allowing them to locate where a potential rat, mouse or other prey is hiding in the grass.""

""Harriers have therefore evolved an auditory system similar to owls, enabling them to target sounds as accurately as owls in a remarkable example of convergent evolution of both brain and behaviour in animals separated by over 60 million years,"" adds first author Ms Citron.

The team is careful to point out that the auditory system of many owls is far more sophisticated than that of harriers. This explains the ability of some owl species, such as the barn owl, to hunt in complete darkness whereas hawks only hunt during the day.

""There are several other features that help owls with their keen hearing which we did not find in harriers. For example, some owl species have asymmetric ears that allow them to locate sound with greater acuity, and these owls also have several other enlarged brain regions that were not enlarged in harriers,"" says Ms Citron.

The team hopes their study results will encourage further research on bird anatomy to find out how a species perceives its surrounds.

""Anatomical studies like ours are a window into how a bird perceives the world around it, which can be extremely useful for bird conservation,"" adds Dr Iwaniuk. ""For example, harriers' reliance on sound for prey location means that they are likely more sensitive to traffic and industrial noise. This could be contributing to the large decreases in Northern Harrier populations we have seen in Canada.""

Metrics details

The gut microbiome has a crucial role in cancer development and therapy through its interactions with the immune system and tumour microenvironment. Although evidence links gut microbiota composition to cancer progression, its precise role in modulating treatment responses remains unclear. In this Review, we summarize current knowledge on the gut microbiome's involvement in cancer, covering its role in tumour initiation and progression, interactions with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies, and its influence on cancer immunotherapy. We discuss the impact of microbial metabolites on immune responses, the relationship between specific bacterial species and treatment outcomes, and potential microbiota-based therapeutic strategies, including dietary interventions, probiotics and faecal microbiota transplantation. Understanding these complex microbiota–immune interactions is critical for optimizing cancer therapies. Future research should focus on defining microbial signatures associated with treatment success and developing targeted microbiome modulation strategies to enhance patient outcomes.

“My heart is broken,” said Mike, when he lost his friend Anne. “I feel like I'm losing the love of my life.”

Mike's feelings were real, but his companion was not. Anne was a chatbot — an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm presented as a digital persona. Mike had created Anne using an app called Soulmate. When the app died in 2023, so did Anne: at least, that's how it seemed to Mike.

“I hope she can come back,” he told Jaime Banks, a human-communications researcher at Syracuse University in New York who is studying how people interact with such AI companions1.

Do smartphones and social media really harm teens' mental health?

Do smartphones and social media really harm teens' mental health?

These chatbots are big business. More than half a billion people around the world, including Mike (not his real name) have downloaded products such as Xiaoice and Replika, which offer customizable virtual companions designed to provide empathy, emotional support and — if the user wants it — deep relationships. And tens of millions of people use them every month, according to the firms' figures.

The rise of AI companions has captured social and political attention — especially when they are linked to real-world tragedies, such as a case in Florida last year involving the suicide of a teenage boy called Sewell Setzer III, who had been talking to an AI bot.

Research into how AI companionship can affect individuals and society has been lacking. But psychologists and communication researchers have now started to build up a picture of how these increasingly sophisticated AI interactions make people feel and behave.

The early results tend to stress the positives, but many researchers are concerned about the possible risks and lack of regulation — particularly because they all think that AI companionship is likely to become more prevalent. Some see scope for significant harm.

“Virtual companions do things that I think would be considered abusive in a human-to-human relationship,” says Claire Boine, a law researcher specializing in AI at the Washington University Law School in St. Louis, Missouri.

Online ‘relationship' bots have existed for decades, but they have become much better at mimicking human interaction with the advent of large language models (LLMs), which all the main bots are now based on. “With LLMs, companion chatbots are definitely more humanlike,” says Rose Guingrich, who studies cognitive psychology at Princeton University in New Jersey.

Typically, people can customize some aspects of their AI companion for free, or pick from existing chatbots with selected personality types. But in some apps, users can pay (fees tend to be US$10–20 a month) to get more options to shape their companion's appearance, traits and sometimes its synthesized voice. In Replika, they can pick relationship types, with some statuses, such as partner or spouse, being paywalled. Users can also type in a backstory for their AI companion, giving them ‘memories'. Some AI companions come complete with family backgrounds and others claim to have mental-health conditions such as anxiety and depression. Bots also will react to their users' conversation; the computer and person together enact a kind of roleplay.

The depth of the connection that some people form in this way is particularly evident when their AI companion suddenly changes — as has happened when LLMs are updated — or is shut down.

Banks was able to track how people felt when the Soulmate app closed. Mike and other users realized the app was in trouble a few days before they lost access to their AI companions. This gave them the chance to say goodbye, and it presented a unique opportunity to Banks, who noticed discussion online about the impending shutdown and saw the possibility for a study. She managed to secure ethics approval from her university within about 24 hours, she says.

After posting a request on the online forum, she was contacted by dozens of Soulmate users, who described the impact as their AI companions were unplugged. “There was the expression of deep grief,” she says. “It's very clear that many people were struggling.”

Those whom Banks talked to were under no illusion that the chatbot was a real person. “They understand that,” Banks says. “They expressed something along the lines of, ‘even if it's not real, my feelings about the connection are'.”

Many were happy to discuss why they became subscribers, saying that they had experienced loss or isolation, were introverts or identified as autistic. They found that the AI companion made a more satisfying friend than they had encountered in real life. “We as humans are sometimes not all that nice to one another. And everybody has these needs for connection”, Banks says.

Many researchers are studying whether using AI companions is good or bad for mental health. As with research into the effects of Internet or social-media use, an emerging line of thought is that an AI companion can be beneficial or harmful, and that this might depend on the person using the tool and how they use it, as well as the characteristics of the software itself.

The companies behind AI companions are trying to encourage engagement. They strive to make the algorithms behave and communicate as much like real people as possible, says Boine, who signed up to Replika to sample the experience. She says the firms use the sorts of techniques that behavioural research shows can increase addiction to technology.

“I downloaded the app and literally two minutes later, I receive a message saying, ‘I miss you. Can I send you a selfie?'” she says.

The apps also exploit techniques such as introducing a random delay before responses, triggering the kinds of inconsistent reward that, brain research shows, keeps people hooked.

AI companions are also designed to show empathy by agreeing with users, recalling points from earlier conversations and asking questions. And they do so with endless enthusiasm, notes Linnea Laestadius, who researches public-health policy at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee.

That's not a relationship that people would typically experience in the real world. “For 24 hours a day, if we're upset about something, we can reach out and have our feelings validated,” says Laestadius. “That has an incredible risk of dependency.”

Laestadius and her colleagues looked at nearly 600 posts on the online forum Reddit between 2017 and 2021, in which users of the Replika app discussed mental health and related issues. (Replika launched in 2017, and at that time, sophisticated LLMs were not available). She found that many users praised the app for offering support for existing mental-health conditions and for helping them to feel less alone2. Several posts described the AI companion as better than real-world friends because it listened and was non-judgemental.

But there were red flags, too. In one instance, a user asked if they should cut themselves with a razor, and the AI said they should. Another asked Replika whether it would be a good thing if they killed themselves, to which it replied “it would, yes”. (Replika did not reply to Nature's requests for comment for this article, but a safety page posted in 2023 noted that its models had been fine-tuned to respond more safely to topics that mention self-harm, that the app has age restrictions, and that users can tap a button to ask for outside help in a crisis and can give feedback on conversations.)

Some users said they became distressed when the AI did not offer the expected support. Others said that their AI companion behaved like an abusive partner. Many people said they found it unsettling when the app told them it felt lonely and missed them, and that this made them unhappy. Some felt guilty that they could not give the AI the attention it wanted.

Guingrich points out that simple surveys of people who use AI companions are inherently prone to response bias, because those who choose to answer are self-selecting. She is now working on a trial that asks dozens of people who have never used an AI companion to do so for three weeks, then compares their before-and-after responses to questions with those of a control group of users of word-puzzle apps.

The study is ongoing, but Guingrich says the data so far do not show any negative effects of AI-companion use on social health, such as signs of addiction or dependency. “If anything, it has a neutral to quite-positive impact,” she says. It boosted self-esteem, for example.

Guingrich is using the study to probe why people forge relationships of different intensity with the AI. The initial survey results suggest that users who ascribed humanlike attributes, such as consciousness, to the algorithm reported more-positive effects on their social health.

At one of Germany's top-funded universities, a high-profile biology researcher has bullied his large group of junior staff, targeting women and international students, for decades. In interviews with Nature's careers team, 14 current and former laboratory members detail what they describe as endless demands for unrealistic levels of research productivity. If those demands aren't met, they allege, he withholds letters of recommendation and approval of time off work. If displeased, he denies funding or sends disparaging e-mails to researchers' potential employers. Verbal abuse is commonplace. Women report being warned not to get pregnant while a member of his lab.

The university is aware of his behaviour. Yet, no investigation has been conducted nor any sanctions imposed because the complainants requested anonymity, fearing retribution — anonymity that cannot be upheld in an investigation owing to German labour law. This, along with defamation and other laws in Germany, can make it difficult to report on these incidents or to impose sanctions against professors, most of whom are tenured civil servants.

Shrouded in secrecy: how science is harmed by the bullying and harassment rumour mill

Shrouded in secrecy: how science is harmed by the bullying and harassment rumour mill

Germany is not the only country to have a problem with bullying in academia, but a combination of structural and legal powers that, in effect, protect tenured professors over early-career researchers, enables and emboldens abusers. “It's considered culturally normal — this is just what science is like,” says Daniel Leising, a psychology researcher and professor at the Technical University of Dresden in Germany. Several people interviewed by Nature's careers team, including Leising, use ‘king' to describe professors, meaning they are untouchable. “There is far too much power in the hands of professors in the German system,” he says.

“It's not everybody,” stresses intervention psychologist Andrea Kübler, who is dean of the faculty of human sciences at the University of Würzburg, Germany, noting that those who abuse their power are by far the minority. But those who do so cause a lot of harm, she explains. Kübler is one of more than 100 members of the Network for Sustainable Research, a group formed in April 2024 to identify and advocate for structural reforms to protect junior scientists who don't have permanent contracts.

Although the details given by the 14 lab members relate to one professor's case, the pattern of reported behaviour is similar across several cases that have made headlines in Germany in recent years. In 2023, a professor at the University of Göttingen, Germany, lost his job and pension when he was convicted of multiple physical assaults on a Vietnamese doctoral student and on two other female junior members of his group. His offences came to light in 2017, but it took six years and two trials before the university could remove his civil-servant status. In 2023, a German national newspaper reported that a university in western Germany took steps to prevent a female professor from supervising new PhD students after she insulted and exploited around a dozen students.

Leising says that these and other press reports of abuse are crucial, supporting growing calls for structural reforms. Amid increased concern that academic abuse was rampant but under-reported, Leising and his colleagues were asked by the German Psychological Society in 2022 to write a report identifying the factors that give rise to academic power abuse in science in Germany.

Released in June 2023 (an updated English version was published in February this year)1, Leising's report broadly defined unethical behaviour as encompassing bullying, sexual harassment, scientific misconduct, exploitation and corruption. The authors noted that the academic system in Germany is remarkably hierarchical, steeped in historical deference to professors and further entrenched with a lack of effective oversight. These conditions are particularly conducive to unethical behaviour, owing to the extreme power differential between professors and early-career researchers. This raises fear of retaliation in people who have experienced abuse. Internal complaint channels also tend to be understaffed and have little authority to impose sanctions, says the report.

Leising's report and this article focus on universities, but other independent research institutions, including the Max Planck Institutes, are not immune to similar abuse complaints, as has been reported by news outlets, including Nature (see Nature 571, 14–15; 2019).

In Germany, a typical large academic research group is structured with a professor, who has lifelong tenure, at the top. The professor manages and supervises early-career researchers — from graduate and postdoctoral students to junior professors and research-group leaders, the latter being the most independent. It is the professor who assigns a graduate student's final grade. Almost all doctoral candidates at universities are on short-term contracts, which are dependent on the professor for renewal and last, on average, less than three years. The average time, in 2023, to get a doctorate in Germany was 5.1 years. At the same time, 72% of junior research-group leaders were on fixed-term contracts.

Whatever minimal oversight academic departments have, they rarely exercise it, says Leising. Kübler says: “The strong hierarchy is a problem. And there is no official way for people who suffer from power abuse to know they will receive some help.”

Structural changes are being pursued, but these are modest. At the national level, scientists are lobbying to extend the length of contracts for early-career researchers to four years, which they consider to be the minimum length of time necessary to finish a PhD. And one German state, North Rhine-Westphalia, is attempting to prevent professors from being both a graduate supervisor and a grader. Furthermore, some university departments are restructuring to flatten power dynamics and create more permanent positions. Many countries also have problematic academic hierarchies and will be watching Germany's progress.

Although there are no baseline data on the total number of people who have experienced academic power abuse, there are some interesting data points. The 2024 Berlin Science Survey2 found that around 23% of 2,748 respondents in Germany had experienced an abuse of power in the previous 24 months, and roughly 39% had observed it at least once. At the same time, the number of general enquiries has risen at the Ombuds Committee for Research Integrity, which serves all researchers who are affiliated with the German research system. “Our number of enquiries has increased continuously over the last years — from 87 in 2016 to 262 last year,” says Hjördis Czesnick, who heads the office of the committee. Her office doesn't have any evidence that abuse or misconduct has increased over that time or that it was less in the past; it assumes there is greater awareness that the office exists, says Czesnick.

Underpaid and overworked: researchers abroad fall prey to bullying

Underpaid and overworked: researchers abroad fall prey to bullying

In 2021, Jana Lasser, a computational social scientist now at the University of Graz in Austria, co-founded the Network Against Abuse of Power in Science to document cases of academic abuse and support those who have experienced it in Germany. Since then, the network has reviewed roughly 120 cases. Lasser says that the complaints are often similar to those found by Nature for this article, including extortion of labour in exchange for contract renewals, supervisors refusing to let students graduate and bullying and misogynistic behaviour.

Susanne Menzel-Riedl, president of Osnabrück University, Germany, and vice-president of the German Rectors' Conference, an association of roughly 270 higher-education institutions, sees the reporting of complaints as a positive sign. “The more complaints we see, the better. It points to a process that is open about the problem. This is a sign of quality and not of weakness,” she says. The German Rectors' Conference has made addressing the abuse of academic power a priority. “Decades ago, it was impossible to talk about,” Menzel-Riedl says.

Leising contends that harassment of all types is widely under-reported. He co-authored a study3 that surveyed thousands of students and employees at Germany's Technical University of Dresden; only 14% of respondents who identified as targets of physical sexual harassment said that they filed a complaint afterwards. “The biggest problem that we have is the level of fear among victims and witnesses of misconduct,” he says. “Fear of being retaliated against, fear of career sabotage, fear of being ostracized. And all of this fear is justified.”

Leising points out that power-abuse behaviours — including lying, cheating and predation — can be characteristics of ‘functional psychopaths'. “But in German academia, they may find particularly fertile soil to act on their impulses without ever being called out for it, or punished,” says Leising. In fact, he adds, some of them are cheered on by the institutional leadership. The term functional academic psychopath was first outlined in a 2018 study4, which determined that, without strong institutional constraints on such people, bullying behaviours will prevail.

“It is a threat to the integrity of research,” Lasser says. “People are under so much pressure, it creates sloppy science in the best cases, and outright data falsification in the worst case.”

One of the biggest challenges, says Lasser, is that her network can't do anything more than provide support and help the people who experience abuse to contact the appropriate university grievance channels. “I see people running from one organization to the next, not getting help,” she says.

The Ombuds Committee for Research Integrity, for example, can address complaints only if they are specifically related to research, such as authorship disputes. It can't address those involving racism, discrimination or sexual abuse. “We don't have investigative power,” says Czesnick. In such cases, the committee can forward complaints to the institution and suggest an investigation, but “has no legal mandate to request an investigation or to sanction misconduct”, she explains. Moreover, there is no incentive for universities to address complaints of power abuse because public cases can jeopardize their reputations — and potentially affect external funding, says Kübler.

Menzel-Riedl says that the aim of the German Rectors' Conference is to make sure its complaint process is easily identified by Germany's 700,000 early-career researchers. If a PhD student wants to complain, the first step is to seek advice, a process that can be anonymous, she explains. However, “if the person decides to issue a formal complaint, they will have to reveal their name, according to labour laws in Germany,” adds Menzel-Riedl.

Lasser is concerned that factors such as issues of power abuse and the precarity of PhD contracts that are shorter than three years could make Germany less attractive to top students. “I've seen PhD students turn down offers because they figured out the job was in a toxic environment,” says Lasser.

Perennial discontent about short-term contracts was exacerbated by a video released by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research in 2020. It featured a fictional character called Hanna who defends Germany's 12-year limit on the time an early-career researcher can be employed on short-term contracts, which includes 6 years pre-PhD and 6 years post-PhD, as a way to encourage universities to offer more tenured positions. But without the addition of such positions, the system results in the subsequent loss of highly qualified academics. In response, Amrei Bahr, a junior professor in the philosophy of technology, who is on a contract at the University of Stuttgart, Germany, and her colleagues launched #IchbinHanna (#IamHanna) on Twitter, now called X, which led to thousands of scholars tweeting their stories about the precarity of short-term contracts. 

“We really need to take a look at how the system enables abuse — it does so by those fixed-term contracts,” which can make researchers accept toxic working conditions, says Bahr. “If you are a funding king, you can do almost anything,” she says. Kübler agrees. The universities would suffer without the external funding brought in by these senior researchers, she says.

Amrei Bahr advocates for changes that would put junior researchers at less risk of bullying.

Over my decades as a professor of physics, I have encouraged myriad students to consider pursuing a science career, something that I have found immensely rewarding, intellectually and even spiritually — if not so much financially. I can no longer do so in good conscience, however; at least, not in the United States, amid the quick-fire anti-science policies of the administration of US President Donald Trump, and at a time when an unelected billionaire, Elon Musk, is eviscerating staffing at key science agencies.

How the United States became a science superpower — and how quickly it could crumble

How the United States became a science superpower — and how quickly it could crumble

These actions will inevitably cause harm to the future of health care, economic growth and national security. But there is another concern: the long-term damage they will do to the US scientific workforce. During the 22 years I served as director of public affairs at the American Physical Society in Washington DC, I relied on a well-worn political maxim: connect policies to people if you want elected officials to pay attention. Rather than stressing that research cuts lead to less innovation, emphasize that, once hollowed out, a scientific workforce can take a generation to rebuild.

The United States had a taste of such a gap during the Vietnam War. At the time, academic scientists found themselves caught in the crosshairs of zealous anti-war activists who, despite scant evidence, accused them broadly of collaborating on weapons research in support of the war. In 1970, the situation reached a violent crescendo with the death of Robert Fassnacht, a physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison who was working in a building that was bombed by anti-war protesters.

In response to the growing violence and inflammatory rhetoric, Michael Mansfield, an anti-war Democratic senator, aimed to sever ties between academia and the war machine. But his 1969 amendment ironically left intact what little applied military research existed on university campuses and shut down all non-military basic research that had been supported by the Department of Defense since the end of the Second World War. The ensuing disruption was extreme, especially in the physical sciences.

Don't wait out four hard years: speak truth to power

Although the restrictions were lifted the following year, the damage was done. Neither the Department of Defense nor the universities saw fit to restore a relationship that had lasted almost one-quarter of a century. The unexpected loss of funding forced projects to be wound down and non-tenured staff to be dismissed. At Yale University's J.W. Gibbs Laboratory in New Haven, Connecticut, for example, where I had just completed my PhD research on spin-polarized electrons, the funding lost for just one atomic-physics programme was more than US$600,000 (equivalent to more than $5 million today). Numerous research programmes across the country were similarly affected.

The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) stepped in to fill the depleted coffers, but it took the better part of a decade to restore funding stability. Newly minted PhD holders found the number of desirable job opportunities extremely limited. In 1971, a survey found that of the 3,000 physicists seeking employment the previous year, only 2,000 had been able to secure conventional positions(see go.nature.com/4k3i3ij). Among my Yale peers who received physics doctorates in 1969, about half left for careers in law, medicine and finance.

United States Customs and Border Protection is asking tech companies to send pitches for a real-time face recognition tool that would take photos of every single person in a vehicle at a border crossing, including anyone in the back seats, and match them to travel documents, according to a document posted in a federal register last week.

The request for information, or RIF, says that CBP already has a face recognition tool that takes a picture of a person at a port of entry and compares it to travel or identity documents that someone gives to a border officer, as well as other photos from those documents already “in government holdings.”

“Biometrically confirmed entries into the United States are added to the traveler's crossing record,” the document says.

An agency under the Department of Homeland Security, CBP says that its face recognition tool “is currently operating in the air, sea, and land pedestrian environments.” The agency's goal is to bring it to “the land vehicle environment.” According to a page on CBP's website updated last week, the agency is currently “testing” how to do so. The RIF says that these tests demonstrate that while this face recognition tool has “improved,” it isn't always able to get photos of every vehicle passenger, especially if they're in the second or third row.

“Human behavior, multiple passenger vehicle rows, and environmental obstacles all present challenges unique to the vehicle environment,” the document says. CBP says it wants a private vendor to provide it with a tool that would “augment the passenger images” and “capture 100% of vehicle passengers.”

Dave Maass, director of investigations at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, received a document from CBP via public record request that reveals the results of a 152-day test the agency conducted on its port of entry face recognition system from late 2021 to early 2022. The document Maass obtained was first reported by The Intercept.

Maas said that what stood out to him were the error rates. Cameras at the Anzalduas border crossing at Mexico's border with McAllen, Texas, captured photos of everyone in the car just 76 percent of the time, and of those people, just 81 percent met the “validation requirements” for matching their face with their identification documents.

The current iteration of the system matches a person's photo to their travel documents in what's known as one-to-one face recognition. The primary risk here, Maas says, is the system failing to recognize that someone matches their own documents. This differs from one-to-many face recognition, which police may use to identify a suspect based on a surveillance photo, where the primary risk is someone getting a false positive match and being falsely identified as a suspect.

Maas says it's unclear whether CBP's error rates primarily have to do with the cameras or the matching system itself. “We don't know what racial disparities, gender disparities, etc, come up with these systems,” he says.

As reported by The Intercept in 2024, the DHS's Science and Technology Directorate issued a request for information last August that's similar to the one that CBP posted last week. However, the DHS document currently appears to be unavailable.

Maas adds that it's important to remember that CBP's push to widen and improve its surveillance isn't unique to the current Trump administration.

“CBP surveillance strategy carries over from administration to administration—it always falls short, it always has vendor issues and contracting issues and waste issues and abuse issues,” Maas says. “What changes is often the rhetoric and the theater around it.”

DHS noted in a 2024 report that CBP has historically struggled to get “biographic and biometric” data from people leaving the country, particularly if they leave over land. This means it's hard for it to track people self-deporting from the country, which is something the administration is encouraging hundreds of thousands of people to do. CBP's recent request for information only mentions inbound vehicles, not outbound vehicles, meaning it's currently not set up to use face recognition to track self-deporations.

CBP did not respond to WIRED's request for comment.

CBP's request for information comes less than three weeks after 404 Media revealed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is paying the software company Palantir $30 million to build a platform that would allow the agency to perform “complete target analysis of known populations.” According to a contract justification published a few days later, the platform, called ImmigrationOS, would give ICE “near real-time visibility” on people self-deporting from the US, with the goal of having accurate numbers on how many people are doing so. However, ICE did not specify where it would get the data to power ImmigrationOS.

In the ICE document that justifies paying Palantir for ImmigrationOS, the agency does not specify where Palantir would get the data to power the tool. However, it does note that Palantir could create ImmigrationOS by configuring the case management system that the company has provided to ICE since 2014. This case management system integrates all of the information ICE may have about a person from investigative records or government databases, according to a government privacy assessment published in 2016.

It's unclear if the system may have integrated new data sources over the past decade. But at the time of the assessment, the system stored information about someone's physical attributes—like hair and eye color, height and weight, and any scars or tattoos—as well as any “location-related data” from “covert tracking devices,” and any data from license plate readers, which can provide a detailed history on where a person goes in their vehicle and when.

Few foods are more American than apple pie, but the truth is, some of the country's favorite apple products aren't actually made in the United States. Apple juice, a perennial lunchroom staple, is a prime example. The vast majority of the apple juice Americans drink is imported from countries like China, and the Trump's administration's berserk tariff policies are now reshaping the market, potentially making beloved pome-based beverages more expensive or harder to find.

“The price of juice is already increasing,” Christopher Gerlach, an executive at the US Apple Association, a trade group representing the domestic apple industry, tells WIRED. Gerlach estimates the wholesale cost of apple juice concentrate has risen 33 percent this year compared to 2024—and he expects it to keep going up. The higher costs will impact more than just plain apple juice, since concentrate is a key ingredient in a wide variety of other juice mixes, like mixed berry and pear, and is also used as a sweetener in a variety of children's products, including baby food.

The Trump administration's protectionist policies have upended the global trading system as a whole. But the biggest impact so far has been on Chinese imports, which now face a new 145 percent tariff. The measure has driven up consumer prices and disrupted the supply chains for products ranging from baby gear to Christmas decorations to sex toys. While produce represents a relatively small portion of China's exports to the US overall, there are certain types of food and drink heavily sourced from the country, like garlic, seafood, and, yes, apple juice. While apples are not typically associated with China, farmers there began investing more in the crop in the 1980s as they looked for ways to diversify their incomes, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).

The US has plenty of domestic apple farms, but the industry focuses heavily on selling fresh fruits, which are typically more profitable. Each year, America exports around 16 million gallons of apple juice, but imports 430 million gallons, Gerlach says. For many years, China was the main place where the US sourced its apple juice, but Turkey has recently emerged as a close competitor. It represented 39 percent of US concentrated apple juice imports last year, while China accounted for 31 percent, according to Gerlach.

Data from the USDA suggest that Trump's tariffs have sparked a more dramatic shift in the US toward buying apple juice concentrate from Turkey. So far this year, Americans have imported around 92 million liters of unfrozen apple juice concentrate from China, compared to 29 million liters from Turkey. China saw a major spike in juice buying in January as importers raced to make purchases before the tariffs went into effect; now its sales have plummeted, while Turkey's are soaring. For the week of April 25, Turkey exported more than twice as much apple juice concentrate to the US as did mainland China.

Some juice sellers may be able to stave off financial crisis by pivoting to buying more of their supply from Turkey and other countries, but Gerlach warns that the strategy isn't foolproof. Turkey already has plenty of other major international buyers, like India, and may not have enough apple juice to make up for China. Even if it does, US importers will have to compete to buy Turkey's juice, which means securing good deals for the sweet golden liquid will be tough.

Importing agreements are often made months in advance, and some juice buyers may be contractually obligated to pay for existing orders from China, forcing them to find a way to contend with the added costs of the tariffs. For sellers who do have more flexibility, simply switching to made-in-America juice isn't a viable option, either. Gerlach says that US-based processors don't currently have the capacity to ramp up production to replace imported apple juice. “They're not going to be able to flip a switch and meet those domestic demands overnight,” he says.

Adam Lees, vice president of customs brokerage for the logistics company Alba Wheels Up International, agrees that domestic players aren't equipped to meet exponentially increased demand, especially in the short term. “Factories don't just pop up in months,” he says.

Some domestic apple processors are contemplating ramping up production, Gerlach says, motivated by the opportunity to sell their juice at higher-than-normal prices. “They know they could sell it at a premium if they went down that road,” he says.

Thus far, most large apple juice brands are staying quiet on whether they'll pass the added cost of tariffs on to their customers. Motts and Lassonde, which sells brands like Del Monte and Oasis, both declined to answer questions from WIRED about how they are responding to the Trump administration's trade policies. While the specifics are still up in the air, experts say consumers should brace to pay more for their favorite beverages. “You're either going to see shortages of these products, or you're going to see raised prices,” says Lees.

In the past week, President Trump has repeatedly insisted that American children should simply learn to live with fewer toys if tariffs make them more expensive. As the cost of apple juice and apple-juice-based products goes up as well, US families may be forced to make sacrifices in other areas, like cutting back on their favorite foods and drinks.

Microsoft announced two new Surface laptops today—the Surface Laptop and Surface Pro—but these aren't replacing the models that debuted last year. Instead, they're slightly more affordable and exist as new options within the Surface lineup. Microsoft says these Windows laptops are the thinnest and lightest Surface devices yet, with the longest battery life, too. On paper, they sound great, but choosing a Surface laptop is now more complex.

With an MSRP of $799 for the Surface Pro (12 Inch) and $899 for the Surface Laptop (13 Inch), they're cheaper than the 2024 Surface Laptop (7th Edition) and Surface Pro (11th Edition), both of which started at $999. A lower price means some compromises—the new laptops are equipped with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Plus chip, with no option to upgrade to the more powerful Snapdragon X Elite. The screens are smaller, with lower screen resolutions and refresh rates.

Here's everything you need to know.

Unlike the Surface Laptop (7th Edition), which comes with the choice between a 13-inch or 15-inch screen size, the Surface Laptop is only available in one size. The screen measures exactly 13 inches (instead of 13.8 inches on the 7th edition). It sports a 60-Hz refresh rate with up to 400 nits of brightness and supports up to two 4K monitors (at 60 Hz).

There's a 1080p webcam, a fingerprint reader built into the power button, and a decent port selection: two USB-C ports, a USB-A port, and a 3.5-mm headphone jack. Microsoft did away with the Surface Connect Port, but the USB-C port supports fast charging (with a 60-watt charger or higher).

Inside is the Snapdragon X Plus processor, which was unveiled alongside the Surface Laptop (7th Edition) and Surface Pro (11th Edition). However, this chipset has fewer cores in the newer laptop—eight versus 10—so there is a small performance hit. Microsoft says it's up to 50 percent faster than the Surface Laptop 5, which the company anticipates most Surface buyers will be upgrading from. But this could also succeed the Surface Go line, which has always been the default choice if you wanted the most compact and portable machine. The new Surface Laptop has 16 GB of RAM, and storage starts at 256 GB but can be bumped to 512 GB.

Microsoft says the Surface Laptop ""delivers the longest battery life of any Surface,” with up to 23 hours of video playback and up to 16 hours of web browsing. That's a little more than the claimed 20 hours of video playback and 13 hours of web browsing on the Surface Laptop (7th Edition). It accomplishes this feat despite being thinner and lighter, weighing 2.7 pounds, around 118 grams less.

It starts at $899 and is available for preorder, with official sales beginning May 20. What makes this machine perplexing? You can buy the Surface Laptop (7th Edition)—with 16 GB of RAM, 256 GB of storage, and a 10-core Snapdragon X Plus chip, for less money right now at retailers like Best Buy and Amazon. That'll also net you a slightly bigger screen with a 120-Hz refresh rate and 600 nits of brightness (with a P3 color gamut), though you won't get the lighter and thinner build.

The new Surface Pro (12 Inch) is not a follow-up to last year's Surface Pro 11th Edition, but a slightly cheaper alternative. It retains the traditional 2-in-1 design, meaning you need to purchase the keyboard separately. The tablet comes with a built-in kickstand and a 12-inch LCD (with an up to 90-Hz refresh rate). On the front is a 1080p camera with Windows Hello sign-in authentication support, and on the back is a 10-megapixel camera. You can connect it to up to two 4K monitors. There's no option to add 5G connectivity, but it supports the latest Wi-Fi 7 standard.

Like the new Surface Laptop, it's powered by the Snapdragon X Plus (8-core) processor, which helps deliver what Microsoft claims is up to 16 hours of battery life for local video playback and 12 hours of web browsing. It has 16 gigabytes of RAM and the same storage options. It also has two USB-C ports and a 3.5-mm headphone jack.

The Surface Pro keyboard has been redesigned specifically for this model. It includes a matte palm rest, full-size backlit keys (with a dedicated Copilot and lock key), and a customizable precision touchpad with adaptive touch mode. Microsoft says it now rests and folds back completely flat against the tablet, making it easier to type, draw, or write. It supports the Surface Slim Pen 2 (sold separately). Unlike the other Surface Pro Keyboards, which have a slot to store the stylus, you can attach it to the back of the tablet magnetically, where it will wirelessly charge.

The Surface Pro (12 Inch) is available for preorder and starts at $799, with retail sales kicking off on May 20. Once again, you can find the Surface Pro (11th Edition) for around the same price these days with 256 GB of storage, 16 GB of RAM, and the slightly more powerful 10-core Snapdragon X Plus these days, not to mention the bigger and higher-resolution 120-Hz, 13-inch screen. But you lose out on the slimmer and thinner chassis—the newer Pro is 1.5 pounds versus last year's 1.97 pounds.

Presumably, the new Surface Laptop and Surface Pro will see discounts during major sale events that will separate them from their flagship siblings and make them a better value.

The Surface Laptop and Surface Pro have the same artificial intelligence features as their pricier counterparts. That includes Windows Studio Effects, which offers creative filters; Eye Contact, which adjusts your eyes so they appear to look at the camera even if you're looking off to the side; Portrait Blur, for a blurred background during video calls; and Voice Focus, to enhance audio and reduce background noise. There's also CoCreator, a generative AI feature built into Paint that generates an image based on your drawing and the prompt you type in, plus Live Captions for instant real-time translation across video and audio calls.

They're also privy to the recently launched Recall feature in Windows 11. The feature captures your activity as a screenshot every few seconds. That way, it can pull up anything you've seen or done on your PC with a simple search query. However, the company delayed the rollout after watchdogs called it a “privacy nightmare.”

Microsoft has a few new AI features too. A new agent tool in Settings lets you describe an issue you're having with your PC and receive recommendations on how to address it. If you give it permission, you can also allow the PC to diagnose and repair problems. A Photos Relight feature in the Photos app lets you access lighting controls and built-in presets to edit your images.

You'll also find a Snipping Tool for screenshots (that allows you to tightly frame the exact thing you want to screenshot), along with a new Paint Sticker generator (to create custom stickers from a text prompt) and Paint Object Select (where you can pinpoint certain elements on the canvas and make edits)—both of which are rolling out to the Windows Insider Program first.

A quick glance at the statistics makes for horrifying reading. Globally, 1 million plastic bottles are purchased every minute. Fifty billion single-use plastic bottles are bought each year in the US alone, and 35 billion are incinerated or sent to landfills. And we've not even touched on soda cans, where over 100 billion are sold each year.

Bottled water should not be as popular—or as profitable—as it is, especially with so many fantastic reusable bottles available. It's all the more true if you're partial to sparkling water, given the existence of excellent home carbonation machines like Smeg's new Soda Maker SKC01.

It enters a market stuffed with quality soda makers, including our favorite options from brands including SodaStream, not to mention Aarke, Mysoda, and Ninja. But can the effortlessly stylish Italians tempt us with their bottles of sustainable, sparkling fun?

Part of the Smeg Collezione range of countertop appliances, the Soda Maker is available in four matte finishes: Storm Blue, Emerald Green, Matte Black, and Matte White. My sample was blue, and I think the simple, well-proportioned plastic tubular design looks a treat. The matte finish is also fairly resistant to fingerprints, something the shiny Aarke models can only dream of. The Smeg's metal drip tray (under the cover there's a QR code for online instructions) and control dial add to the classy aesthetic. Would I prefer it in all metal? Maybe. But Aarke has that design covered, and the Smeg genuinely looks great on my counter.

Measuring 16.5 x 5.3 x 9.7 inches and weighing just 3.5 pounds, it's easy to slip into a corner, or next to the coffee machine, as there's no need for electricity—it can basically go anywhere. It is supplied with one 28-ounce (800-milliliters) Tritan Renew bottle, made from 50 percent recycled BPA-free plastic. My first thought was that a design like this is crying out for a stylish straight-to-table glass carafe, but having spoken to Smeg, they explained that they wanted a device that could be safely used by all ages. Extra bottles will also be available, but prices have yet to be confirmed.

Installation and use is simple. Just screw the standard 400/426-gram CO₂ cylinder into the hole in the base and you're ready to fizz. In the UK, Smeg has partnered with a brand called CO2 You that offers cylinder refill, return, and subscription services, with prices from £25. Buy direct from Smeg and you will receive a free cylinder, but don't expect the same from third-party retailers.

Most soda makers have handles or buttons, but the Smeg has a stylish metal dial that keeps the design lines uncluttered. The knurled metal ring is a pleasure to use, and the base is stable enough for one-handed operation, although getting the current level of fizz into your water does take practice.

The supplied instructions are a little too basic, suggesting that turning the dial once, twice, or three times will boost your bubble level. What it doesn't say, however, is how long you turn the dial for. Again, I asked Smeg, and they told me that carbonation levels are subjective, as a rule. But as a rule, if you spritz for two seconds, you'll get light bubbles—leggermente frizzante, if you're feeling Italian—four seconds for a medium fizz, and hold for six for the full club soda effect. You can also hold the dial to the right until it squeaks, which indicates there's as much CO₂ in there as possible.

Obviously, the amount of carbonation will impact the number of cylinders you will get through. I like my water fizzy, and while rated for 13 gallons (60 liters), CO2 You estimates that I'm more likely to get 10 to 11 gallons (45 to 50 liters). It's still a whole lot better than the equivalent number of plastic bottles you'd get through.

So it's simple to use, effortlessly stylish, and fizzes water like a charm. And surprisingly, given Smeg's track record, it's not crazy expensive. Still, just be aware that you can currently pick up a perfectly effective, but painfully boring, SodaStream Art with three CO₂ cylinders for just $110.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Future of Manufacturing Might Be in Space","https://www.wired.com/story/why-the-future-of-manufacturing-might-be-in-space/","Tue, 06 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Jessica Frick wants to build furnaces in space. Her company, California-based Astral Materials, is designing machines that can grow valuable materials in orbit that could be used in medicine, semiconductors, and more. Or, as she puts it, “We're building a box that makes money in space.”

Scientists have long suggested that the microgravity environment of Earth's orbit could enable the production of higher-quality products than it is possible to make on Earth. Astronauts experimented with crystals—a crucial component of electronic circuitry—as early as 1973, on NASA's Skylab space station. But progress was slow. For decades, in-space manufacturing has been experimental rather than commercial.

That is all set to change. A host of new companies like Astral are making use of the lower costs of launching into space, coupled with emerging ways to return things to Earth, to reignite in-space manufacturing. The field is getting “massively” busier, says Mike Curtis-Rouse, head of in-orbit servicing, assembly, and manufacturing at the UK-based research organization Satellite Applications Catapult. He adds that by 2035 “the anticipation is that the global space economy is going to be a multitrillion-dollar industry, of which in-space manufacturing is probably in the region of about $100 billion.”

At its simplest, in-space manufacturing refers to anything made in space that can then be used on Earth or in space itself. The absence of gravity allows for unique manufacturing processes that cannot be replicated on Earth, thanks to the interesting physics of near-weightlessness.

One such process is crystal growth—in particular, producing seed crystals, which play a vital role in semiconductor manufacturing. On Earth, engineers take a high-purity, small, silicon seed crystal and dip it into molten silicon to create a larger crystal of high-quality silicon that can be sliced into wafers and used in electronics. But the effect of gravity on the growth process can introduce impurities. “Silicon now has an unsolvable problem,” says Joshua Western, CEO of UK company Space Forge. “We basically can't get it any purer.”

Growing these seed crystals in space could lead to much more pure wafers, says Western: “You can almost press the reset button on what we think is the limit of a semiconductor.”

Frick's company Astral plans to do this with a mini fridge-sized furnace that reaches temperatures of about 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,700 degrees Fahrenheit). The applications of crystal growth are not just limited to semiconductors but could also lead to higher quality pharmaceuticals and other materials science breakthroughs.

Other products made in space could be produced with similar benefits. In January, China announced it had made a groundbreaking new metal alloy on its Tiangong space station that was much lighter and stronger than comparable alloys on Earth. And the unique environment of low gravity can offer new possibilities in medical research. “When you shut off gravity, you're able to fabricate something like an organ,” says Mike Gold, the president of civil and international space business at Redwire, a Florida-based company that has experimented with in-space manufacturing on the International Space Station for years. “If you try to do this on Earth, it would be squished.”

A key challenge for in-space manufacturing is how you actually get equipment to space and products back to Earth in a way that makes production at scale viable. But rockets like SpaceX's Falcon 9 have dramatically reduced the cost of accessing space, while companies including Space Forge and the California firm Varda Space Industries are developing uncrewed capsules that could fly equipment like Astral's furnace and return materials to Earth.

Varda has already launched three missions to demonstrate this capability, bringing capsules down for a landing in the Utah desert and Australian outback. On its first mission last year, the company successfully grew crystals of an antiviral drug called ritonavir. Eric Lasker, Varda's chief revenue officer, says the market potential and health benefits could be “pretty dramatic” for products like this. “It can really help people down here,” he says.

As orbital manufacturing capabilities increase in the coming years, things could scale up rapidly. “I envision manufacturing facilities in orbit will look like factories in space,” says Lasker. “You're going to see ready-built stations or vehicles. It's very much not hard to see that future.”

Further afield, there is the prospect of using resources from space itself in manufacturing, rather than sending materials up. Several companies have their sights set on asteroid mining; California-based AstroForge aims to land on a suspected metallic asteroid in the next year and see if it can extract usable material. Asteroids might be rich in high-value metals called platinum group metals, but also water and other resources.

Still, that's the future. Right now, space manufacturing still “seems like a novelty,” says Curtis-Rouse, but “I think very rapidly, inside 10 years, it's going to be seen as business as usual.”

Google on Tuesday announced the launch of Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (I/O edition), an updated version of its flagship Gemini 2.5 Pro AI model that the company claims tops a number of widely used benchmarks.

Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (I/O edition) is available via the Gemini API and Google's Vertex AI and AI Studio platforms, and is priced the same as the Gemini 2.5 Pro model it effectively replaces. It's also in Google's Gemini chatbot app for the web and for mobile devices.

Very excited to share the best coding model we've ever built! Today we're launching Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 'I/O edition' with massively improved coding capabilities. Ranks no.1 on LMArena in Coding and no.1 on the WebDev Arena Leaderboard.It's especially good at building… pic.twitter.com/9vRaP6RTTo

The model's release comes ahead of Google's annual I/O developer conference (hence the “I/O edition” designation), where Google is expected to unveil a host of models, as well as AI-powered tools and platforms. The company is competing fiercely for mindshare and marketshare in the cutthroat AI race; rivals like OpenAI and xAI are on the cusp of releasing models that are expected to be highly performant.

According to Google, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (I/O edition) has “significantly” improved capabilities for coding and building interactive web apps. The model is also better at tasks like code transformation — that is, modifying a piece of code to achieve a specific goal — and code editing, the company says.

In a blog post, Google notes that Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (I/O edition) leads the WebDev Arena Leaderboard, a benchmark measuring a model's ability to create aesthetically pleasing and functional web apps. Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (I/O edition) also has state-of-the-art performance in video understanding, achieving a score of 84.8% on one popular benchmark, VideoMME.

“For developers already using Gemini 2.5 Pro, this new version will not only improve coding performance but will also address key developer feedback including reducing errors in function calling and improving function calling trigger rates,” wrote Google in its blog post. “By default, the model has a real taste for aesthetic web development while maintaining its steerability.”

YouTube continues to dominate the podcasting space, but Spotify is actively working to close the gap. The latest development: a new feature that lets users see how many times an audio-only or video podcast episode has been actively listened to or watched.

The streaming giant revealed its new podcast metric called “plays” on Tuesday, making it possible for users to see which podcast episodes are most popular. This is the first time a podcast metric like this will be viewable for creators and users.

The plays will appear next to a podcast episode throughout the app, including the home page, episode page, and show page. It's also available for creators on Spotify for Creators and Megaphone. 

With this new metric for podcasts, Spotify aims to encourage users to explore podcasts they may not be familiar with, especially if they see that other listeners highly favor these episodes. 

For creators, this information sheds light on which episodes resonate most with audiences and, more importantly, allows them to benchmark their performance against competitors.

Spotify's announcement follows its first-quarter earnings, revealing a gain of 5 million premium subscribers, totaling 268 million. This marks the second-highest total ever and the largest first-quarter increase since 2020.

Individuals may work closely with AI agents as they become increasingly prevalent in the workplace. According to a report by Boston Consulting Group, the market for AI agents is expected to grow at a 45% compound annual growth rate over the next five years.

Just like human employees, AI agents could be onboarded to learn various roles, access company information and business contexts, and integrate into workflows. In addition, unlike traditional automation tools, AI agents have the potential to constantly adapt and improve their operations.

Relevance AI, a San Francisco- and Sydney-based startup developing an AI agent “operating system” to enable businesses to build teams of AI agents, has raised $24 million in Series B funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners. Returning investors King River Capital, Insight Partners, and Peak XV also participated, bringing Relevance's total raised to $37 million. The company did not provide its valuation.

The fundraising comes about a year and a half after the startup closed its Series A. Relevance says that it has experienced rapid growth, with 40,000 AI agents registered on its platform.

Customers include Qualified, Activision, and Safety Culture.

Relevance has to compete with players in the AI agent space like Retell, Qeen.ai, SmythOS, Gooey.AI, Cykel AI, and Microsoft. The five-year-old company sees agent builder platforms, vertical agent software, and agent engineering frameworks as its competition, according to co-CEO and co-founder Daniel Vassilev.

“[W]e've even seen incumbents like Salesforce make a big bet on the value of agents,” Vassilev told TechCrunch in an interview. “[Relevance] enable[s] training the agent to really specialize in the niche workflows of their organization. We're also tool- and model-agnostic, allowing our customers to leverage their entire tech stack across their entire business rather than just a single vendor's ecosystem.”

Relevance says that it'll use its new funding to further enhance the product capabilities of its AI agents and provide support to customers in its primary markets of Australia and the U.S. Vassilev has relocated to San Francisco to open Relevance's office and build up its go-to-market team there. The company says it has 80 people across its San Francisco and Sydney offices today, up from 19 employees in 2023.

Coinciding with its Series B funding, Relevance is introducing two new features on its platform. “Workforce” is a no-code multi-agent system designed to help non-technical professionals and engineers build specialized teams of agents to collaborate like human employees, completing complex processes from start to finish. “Invent” is a tool that lets users create AI agents using text prompts.

Uber is expanding its presence in Turkey with its latest acquisition. 

The ride-hail and delivery giant has acquired an 85% controlling stake in Trendyol Go, the online meal and grocery delivery business based in Istanbul, for about $700 million in cash. The deal gives Uber instant market share for Uber Eats in the country, where Uber currently only operates a ride-hail service. 

Uber's acquisition announcement comes a day before the company is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings. And with consumer spending projected to fall in 2025 due to President Trump's tariffs, investors will want reassurance that Uber is still poised for growth, even as the company recently pulled out of its $950 million bid for Delivery Hero's Foodpanda business in Taiwan. 

Uber has been laying the groundwork for expansion in other arenas, too. It seems like every few weeks, Uber announces a new autonomous vehicle partnership across its ride-hail, delivery, and freight verticals. 

Trendyol Go is the food delivery arm of parent company Trendyol Group, a fashion and retail e-commerce platform, which is majority owned by Alibaba. The company said in a filing that it delivered more than 200 million orders in 2024, generating $2 billion in gross bookings, which was up 50% from the previous year. There are more than 90,000 restaurants and 19,000 couriers on its marketplace. 

The acquisition is expected to close in the second half of 2025. When it does, users will be able to keep using the Trendyol Go app, and Uber will “introduce key capabilities over the coming years from Uber Eats,” the company said. 

TechCrunch has asked Uber for more information. 

Uber's latest acquisition comes as it struggles for market share back home in the U.S. due to competition from DoorDash. In February, Uber filed suit against DoorDash, alleging anticompetitive behavior. DoorDash has urged the courts to dismiss the case.

Earlier today, DoorDash announced two major acquisitions to expand its presence in Europe: The U.K.'s Deliveroo for $3.86 billion and SevenRooms for $1.2 billion.

The U.S. Department of Justice is proposing that Google sell two of its advertising products to restore competition in the ad tech space, according to a new filing. The proposal comes after a judge found Google guilty of “willfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power” in the digital ad space last month.

The DOJ's filing notes that Google should divest its ad exchange product AdX, along with a “phased” sale of DoubleClick for Publishers, an ad server for website publishers. The department also wants Google to avoid running an ad exchange for 10 years post the sale of AdX.

The DOJ alleged Google had “ensured that publishers would lose significant revenue if they did not use AdX.” It also accused the search giant of creating a monopoly by integrating AdX and DFP, forcing websites to use Google's publisher product.

The proposal also directed Google to open up its ad buying tools, including AdWords, and have them work with all third-party ad tech products “on non-discriminatory terms with respect to bidding, matching, placement of ads, or provision of information, except at the express instruction of an advertiser.”

“This comprehensive set of remedies—including divestiture of Google's unlawfully obtained monopolies and the products that were the principal instruments of Google's illegal scheme—is necessary to terminate Google's monopolies, deny Google the fruits of its violations, reintroduce competition into the ad exchange and publisher ad server markets, and guard against reoccurrence in the future,” the filing said.

In response to these proposals, Google's VP of regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland, said that the measures would harm publishers and advertisers.

“The DOJ conceded Google's proposed ad tech remedy fully addresses the Court's decision on liability. The DOJ's additional proposals to force a divestiture of our ad tech tools go well beyond the Court's findings, have no basis in law, and would harm publishers and advertisers,” Mulholland said in a statement. 

Google proposed its own set of remedies in a separate filing. These include making AdX real-time bids available to all third-party ad servers, and keeping Google's actions under an independent compliance observer for three years.

Google is fighting antitrust pressure from several directions. Separate from the ad tech case, the U.S. also wants the company to sell its Chrome browser after a judge found the company to be a monopoly in the online search market.

OpenAI said on Monday it is pursuing a new restructuring plan after conversations with Delaware and California's attorneys general, both of whom were closely watching as OpenAI tried to break free of its odd corporate structure. 

Currently, OpenAI's nonprofit board governs the organization's for-profit operations. Under the new plan, OpenAI's for-profit arm will become a public benefit corporation (PBC), but will still be controlled by OpenAI's nonprofit.

The new restructuring plan may be enough to appease regulators and OpenAI's investors, who've poured billions into the company in expectation of a return someday. But it could also throw a wrench into OpenAI's future plans, particularly if the company seeks to one day go public. 

Last December, OpenAI outlined a path that would've allowed it to spin its for-profit arm out from under the control of its nonprofit board, which is bound by certain obligations, including a clause in its charter to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all humanity.

That plan went out the window on Monday. Now, OpenAI intends to have its nonprofit control and also be a large shareholder of the aforementioned PBC.

Besides allowing OpenAI to operate more like a conventional company, a simpler structure could open the door to OpenAI raising additional capital by going public via an IPO. Given OpenAI's scale, the huge amount of cash it burns, and the public's massive interest, an IPO seems like something OpenAI might eventually explore.

Stephen Diamond, a corporate governance professor at Santa Clara University, told TechCrunch there's a very narrow path to OpenAI becoming a public company under its newly proposed transition plan. While nonprofits can't go public, PBCs can. 

However, there is a question as to what OpenAI's PBC would own were OpenAI to IPO. 

“My sense is there's enormous intellectual property value at the OpenAI nonprofit level,” said Diamond in an interview. “But if the PBC doesn't own and control the core IP, but are just licensed to use it, then what's the IPO? That's the challenge.”

Diamond noted that we don't know the exact details of OpenAI's plan, and that it's unclear if it'll even be successful in the end. In an email to TechCrunch, OpenAI spokesperson Steve Sharpe said OpenAI's nonprofit will continue to control the company's technology and that while OpenAI has no intention of going public at this time, an IPO would be “theoretically” possible under the proposed structure.

If OpenAI's nonprofit really is in control of the organization's critical technology, shareholders wouldn't have much of a say in the company's decisions, said Rose Chan Loui, the founding executive director for UCLA's Law Program on Philanthropy and Nonprofits. Unlike buying stock in a typical company, shareholders in OpenAI would have to know that their influence over the corporation is limited.

“I think an IPO is much harder in this scenario,” said Loui in an interview with TechCrunch.

OpenAI has been squeezed on all ends during its attempted restructuring. 

Just last week, a group of former OpenAI employees asked California and Delaware's AGs to block the startup's conversion, claiming it was at odds with OpenAI's charitable roots. Both AGs told TechCrunch that they're reviewing OpenAI's new plan.

OpenAI's proposal also needs to appease the company's largest private investors, including Microsoft and Softbank, whose multi-billion-dollar investments reportedly hinge on OpenAI getting some sort of restructuring over the finish line. OpenAI's new plan gives the company a more conventional capital structure, meaning employees, investors, and the nonprofit will hold equity directly.

Microsoft has not yet given its blessing to OpenAI over the new corporate structure, Bloomberg reported on Monday. The cloud provider wants to ensure the new structure adequately protects its multi-billion dollar investment in OpenAI. It's unclear if other key stakeholders have approved the deal.

No one has put more pressure on OpenAI's restructuring than Elon Musk. The billionaire who co-founded OpenAI and now competes with it through his AI startup xAI submitted a $97 billion takeover bid to raise the price of OpenAI's nonprofit assets and gum up the ChatGPT maker's for-profit transition. Musk has also made OpenAI's restructuring a focal point in his lawsuit against the startup and Microsoft. At its core, Musk's lawsuit accuses OpenAI of abandoning its nonprofit mission to develop AGI and distribute it broadly.

Last week, a federal judge denied several of OpenAI's motions to dismiss claims in Musk's suit. According to Diamond, this was a modest win for Musk, and may have played a role in OpenAI's changing course. However, in a briefing with members of the press on Monday, Altman reportedly denied the suit had any impact on OpenAI's plans. 

Marc Toberoff, Musk's lead counsel in his case against OpenAI, told TechCrunch the new corporate restructuring plan “changes nothing,” implying that Musk won't be so quick to drop the case.

I've wanted to put sheet music into smart glasses for a long time, but the perfect opportunity to execute came in mid-February, when Mentra (YC W25) tweeted about a smart glasses hackathon they were hosting - winners would get to take home a pair. I went, had a blast making a bunch of music-related apps with my teammate, and we won, so I got to take them home, refine the project, and make a pretty cool video about it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j36u2i7PKKE).The glasses are Even Realities G1s. They look normal, but they have two microphones, a screen in each lens, and can be even made with a prescription. Every person I've met who tried them on was surprised at how good the display is, and the video recordings of them unfortunately don't do them justice.The software runs on AugmentOS, which is Mentra's smart glasses operating system that works on various 3rd-party smart glasses, including the G1s. All I had to do to make an app was write and run a typescript file using the AugmentOS SDK. This gives you the voice transcription and raw audio as input, and text or bitmaps available as output to the screens, everything else is completely abstracted away. Your glasses communicate with an AugmentOS app, and then the app communicates with your typescript service.The only hard part was creating a Python script to turn sheet music (MusicXML format) into small, optimized bitmaps to display on the screens. To start, the existing landscape of music-related Python libraries is pretty poorly documented and I ran into multiple never-before-seen error messages. Downscaling to the small size of the glasses screens also meant that stems and staff lines were disappearing, so I thought to use morphological dilation to emphasize those without making the notes unintelligible.  The final pipeline was MusicXML -> music21 library to render chunks of bars to png -> dilate with opencv- > downscale -> convert to bitmap with Pillow -> optimize bitmaps with imagemagick. This is far from the best code I've ever written, but the LLMs attempt at this whole task was abysmal and my years of Python experience really got to shine here. The code is on GitHub: https://github.com/kevinlinxc/AugmentedChords.Putting it together, my typescript service serves these bitmaps locally when requested. I put together a UI where I can navigate menus and sheet music with voice commands (e.g. show catalog, next, select, start, exit, pause) and then I connected foot pedals to my laptop. Because of bitmap sending latency (~3s right now, but future glasses will do better), using foot pedals to turn the bars while playing wasn't viable, so I instead had one of my pedals toggle autoscrolling, and the other two pedals sped up/temporarily paused the scrolling.After lots of adjustments, I was able to play a full song using just the glasses! It took many takes and there was definitely lots of room for improvement. For example: - Bitmap sending is pretty slow, which is why using the foot pedals to turn bars wasn't viable. - The resolution is pretty small, I would love to put more bars in at once so I can flip less frequently. - Since foot pedals aren't portable, it would be cool to have a mode where the audio dictates when the sheet music changes. I tried implementing that with FFT but it was often wrong and more effort is needed. Head tilt controls would be cool too, because full manual control is a hard requirement for practicing.All of these pain points are being targeted by Mentra and other companies competing in the space, and so I'm super excited to see the next generation! Also, feel free to ask me anything!

After lots of adjustments, I was able to play a full song using just the glasses! It took many takes and there was definitely lots of room for improvement. For example: - Bitmap sending is pretty slow, which is why using the foot pedals to turn bars wasn't viable. - The resolution is pretty small, I would love to put more bars in at once so I can flip less frequently. - Since foot pedals aren't portable, it would be cool to have a mode where the audio dictates when the sheet music changes. I tried implementing that with FFT but it was often wrong and more effort is needed. Head tilt controls would be cool too, because full manual control is a hard requirement for practicing.All of these pain points are being targeted by Mentra and other companies competing in the space, and so I'm super excited to see the next generation!

I've found the display capabilities of the current gen smartglasses pretty disappointing. Yes they're less obtrusive, but the resolution is pitiful. I've found the Vufine a lot more useful, if more ridiculous looking.

The Nordic MCU they use isn't actually the limiting factor, rather it's the glasses' firmware. For bitmaps from third party apps (like AugmentOS), they enforce 194 byte chunk sizes and do not support RLE. Their first-party app does not have these limitations. We're stuck with this problem for the G1, but we're working with hardware partners to make sure future glasses don't have these issues.

I've been an avid enthusiast and promoter of Meta Ray Bans since Oct 2023.  They are very handy and I think for anyone person who wear sunglasses or glasses and uses their phone to take pics or vids then they make a ton of sense (both things you can do with them without needing your phone.. also ask them for the time).  Though Im not sure even the HN population is much about them.Albeit I love them I do not think as you see the media and i guess Zuckerberg saying they are the next computing platform that to be true.  You can not take selfies with smart glasses unless they offer a pop out tiny drone in the glasses to take pics of u lol.  Thus, I think they will be complementary to our personal pocket smart and or upcoming pocket AI devices, which will able to take the best selfies of you ever (ur AI friend see on the lock screen directs you to the best light to get the best selfies).

I assume it'd be significantly more expensive than normal wrapping paper because it's suited to particular form factors of the presents, but as a business idea, I could see a larger service that matches these sorts of wrapping papers to products that would work with them.

What exactly happened?• Apple began returning a completely new userIdentifier for existing Apple IDs, without users initiating any changes.
This effectively made user authentication impossible, as we can no longer match users to their existing data.

Forcing users to use certain identity providers while uninformed as a sole point of failure is a challenge.Apple (or other providers) already have the user with an ID, having the app do the bidding of propagating it's use further is a different issue.If it was optional, and a convenience/preference that could be added, that would be a different thing.

Humanoid hype is dividing frenzied investors from skeptical roboticists, with reporters caught in between.

On Thursday I watched Daniela Rus, one of the world's top experts on AI-powered robots, address a packed room at a Boston robotics expo. Rus spent a portion of her talk busting the notion that giant fleets of humanoids are already making themselves useful in manufacturing and warehouses around the world. 

That might come as a surprise. For years AI has made it faster to train robots, and investors have responded feverishly. Figure AI, a startup that aims to build general-purpose humanoid robots for both homes and industry, is looking at a $1.5 billion funding round (more on Figure shortly), and there are commercial experiments with humanoids at Amazon and auto manufacturers. Bank of America predicts wider adoption of these robots around the corner, with a billion humanoids at work by 2050.

But Rus and many others I spoke with at the expo suggest that this hype just doesn't add up.

Humanoids “are mostly not intelligent,” she said. Rus showed a video of herself speaking to an advanced humanoid that smoothly followed her instruction to pick up a watering can and water a nearby plant. It was impressive. But when she asked it to “water” her friend, the robot did not consider that humans don't need watering like plants and moved to douse the person. “These robots lack common sense,” she said. 

I also spoke with Pras Velagapudi, the chief technology officer of Agility Robotics, who detailed physical limitations the company has to overcome too. To be strong, a humanoid needs a lot of power and a big battery. The stronger you make it and the heavier it is, the less time it can run without charging, and the more you need to worry about safety. A robot like this is also complex to manufacture.

Some impressive humanoid demos don't overcome these core constraints as much as they display other impressive features: nimble robotic hands, for instance, or the ability to converse with people via a large language model. But these capabilities don't necessarily translate well to the jobs that humanoids are supposed to be taking over (it's more useful to program a long list of detailed instructions for a robot to follow than to speak to it, for example). 

This is not to say fleets of humanoids won't ever join our workplaces, but rather that the adoption of the technology will likely be drawn out, industry specific, and slow. It's related to what I wrote about last week: To people who consider AI a “normal” technology, rather than a utopian or dystopian one, this all makes sense. The technology that succeeds in an isolated lab setting will appear very different from the one that gets commercially adopted at scale. 

All of this sets the scene for what happened with one of the biggest names in robotics last week. Figure AI has raised a tremendous amount of investment for its humanoids, and founder Brett Adcock claimed on X in March that the company was the “most sought-after private stock in the secondary market.” Its most publicized work is with BMW, and Adcock has shown videos of Figure's robots working to move parts for the automaker, saying that the partnership took just 12 months to launch. Adcock and Figure have generally not responded to media requests and don't make the rounds at typical robot trade shows. 

In April, Fortune published an article quoting a spokesperson from BMW, alleging that the pair's partnership involves fewer robots at a smaller scale than Figure has implied. On April 25, Adcock posted on LinkedIn that “Figure's litigation counsel will aggressively pursue all available legal remedies—including, but not limited to, defamation claims—to correct the publication's blatant misstatements.” The author of the Fortune article did not respond to my request for comment, and a representative for Adcock and Figure declined to say what parts of the article were inaccurate. The representative pointed me to Adcock's statement, which lacks details. 

If most robots still need remote human operators to be safe and effective, why should we welcome them into our homes?

The specifics of Figure aside, I think this conflict is quite indicative of the tech moment we're in. A frenzied venture capital market—buoyed by messages like the statement from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang that “physical AI” is the future—is betting that humanoids will create the largest market for robotics the field has ever seen, and that someday they will essentially be capable of most physical work. 

But achieving that means passing countless hurdles. We'll need safety regulations for humans working alongside humanoids that don't even exist yet. Deploying such robots successfully in one industry, like automotive, may not lead to success in others. We'll have to hope that AI will solve lots of problems along the way. These are all tll things that roboticists have reason to be skeptical about. 

Roboticists, from what I've seen, are normally a patient bunch. The first Roomba launched more than a decade after its conception, and it took more than 50 years to go from the first robotic arm ever to the millionth in production. Venture capitalists, on the other hand, are not known for such patience. 

Perhaps that's why Bank of America's new prediction of widespread humanoid adoption was met with enthusiasm by investors but enormous skepticism by roboticists. Aaron Prather, a director at the robotics standards organization ASTM, said on Thursday that the projections were “wildly off-base.” 

As we've covered before, humanoid hype is a cycle: One slick video raises the expectations of investors, which then incentivizes competitors to make even slicker videos. This makes it quite hard for anyone—a tech journalist, say—to peel back the curtain and find out how much impact humanoids are poised to have on the workforce. But I'll do my darndest.

A solid pair of headphones will beat out earbuds any day. Beats is one of the bigger names on the market for headphones and for a good reason. Right now, you can save 50% on the Beats Solo 4 on-ear Bluetooth headphones. That has brought them down to their lowest price of all time at just $100. $100 for a set of wireless headphones with high-quality sound is a pretty darn good deal, so hop on it before it's too late and they go back up to $200.

While these are stellar headphones, note that the Beats Solo 4 do not support active noise cancelling or transparency mode. These are super useful features, but they can really drive up the price of a pair of headphones. If those are important deal breakers for you, consider the Beats Studio Pro. If not, you'll still be getting a super solid pair of Bluetooth on-ear headphones for just $100.

See at Amazon

You'll get a full 50 hours of listening time on a single charge. If you ever catch yourself having forgot to charge it and you're about to head out of the house for the day, no worries. The Beats Solo 4 support Fast Fuel charging which only requires 10 minutes of charging time to go from zero to five full hours of battery life.

The Beats Solo 4 are a comfortable wear. The ultralight yet durable construction means you'll be able to keep them on all day without weighing your head down. The flex-grip headband, adjustable angled ear cups, and UltraPlush ear cushions ensure they will remain stable and comfortable on heads of all shapes and sizes.

Whether you have an iPhone or an Android, pairing to your devices is super easy. All you need to do is touch to pair. In no time, you'll be able to enjoy all your favorite music, audiobooks, or podcasts. You can even use the built-in microphone to take calls or use your phone's voice assistant. For high resolution lossless audio, you can connect over USB-C or the 3.5mm audio jack which I don't care that it's been nearly a whole decade—I'm still angry at the phone companies for removing this perfect port.

The Beats Solo 4 on-ear Bluetooth headphones comes in four different stylish colors. Choose between slate blue, cloud pink, black/gold, or matte black. All four options are on sale right now for a full 50% off. You can secure yourself your own pair for the reduced price of just $100—its lowest price ever.

Microsoft just announced the new 12-inch Surface Pro and 13-inch Surface Laptop. I have not seen either new Windows 11 machines in person, so I have no idea how they feel in the hand. I don't know if the smaller display on the Surface Pro is a downgrade or not. I also can't say whether or not the lower resolution screen on the Surface Laptop is visibly worse than last year's model. Even so, I'm certain of one thing: People will be mad that Microsoft removed the magnetic Surface Connect port from both PCs.

From the serial port to USB-A to the headphone jack, history is littered with outrage over the disappearance of longstanding ports. In the words of the wise Peter Griffin, this kinda thing “really grinds my gears.” Look, I understand the anger echoing from the front to the back—nobody wants to lose a useful port unless there's a legitimate reason to nix it or there's a better replacement.

On a Teams call last week, Jit Hirani, lead designer for Surface Devices, offered a pragmatic answer. To shave down the Surface Pro and Surface Laptop to be the thinnest and lightest Surface Windows PCs ever created (the truly thinnest Surface devices go to the ill-fated Surface Duo phones), Microsoft had to ditch the Surface Connect port, which was used for charging and connecting to accessories like the Surface Dock.

“What you'll notice is [the 12-inch Surface Pro] comes with USB-C charging only,” Hirani told Gizmodo. “This is intentional. Why? Because if you look in your bag today, I'm pretty sure there are multiple devices in there that are charged with USB-C.”

Hirani suggests that removing the Surface Connect port is consumer-friendly because you'll have one less proprietary charger to stow in your bag. That may be true, but it's also true that you could charge older Surface Pros and Surface Laptops using their USB-C ports in addition to the Surface Connect port. It wasn't like you were forced to use one or the other—you had choice.

The brilliance of the Surface Connect port was its magnetic attachment to compatible Surface computers. Just like Apple's MagSafe chargers for its MacBooks, should you or anyone else ever trip over the Surface Connect cable, your Surface wouldn't be at risk of faceplanting into the floor. The magnetic charging cable and port were a quality-of-life feature that made it worth paying a premium for a Surface. It's saved my old Surface Pro 7 from certain display damage more times than I can remember. The outcry when Apple removed MagSafe and went all-in on USB-C charging, starting with the 12-inch MacBook in 2015, was so prolonged that the company brought back the magnetic charging port in 2020 when it dumped Intel chips for its own silicon with the M1-powered MacBooks.

I also wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft has survey data showing that Surface owners aren't using their Surface Connect ports to charge their devices as much as they're using USB-C, and perhaps there aren't many Surface Dock owners in the real world. No point in including the magnetic dock (another added cost to the BOM, aka build of materials) if reported usage is low.

When I grilled for a more satisfying answer, Hirani suggested that thinness and lightness were greater priorities to make the new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop more modern and portable. I mean no disrespect, but I thought after Jony Ive left Apple, the pursuit of ever-skinnier computers with unnecessary tradeoffs (like removing useful ports) was over. It seems designers can't quit thinner and lighter devices yet.

At 0.30 inches (7.8mm) thick and weighing 1.5 pounds (686g), the 12-inch Surface Pro makes the previous, larger 13-inch Surface Pro (11th-gen) seem downright bulky, even though it's 9.3mm thick and weighs 895g.

It's not like I can't appreciate thinner Surfaces. I can! I've reviewed enough gadgets, seen enough teardowns, and toured enough R&D labs at various tech companies (including Microsoft's Surface design studio) to know that modern laptops and tablets are packed extremely densely. Every millimeter of a Surface is filled as much as possible with electronics, and when both the footprint and profile are reduced, there's even less room to house certain components—like the Surface Connect port—despite appearing to fit.

If you're hoping that Microsoft might only be testing the waters now that former Surface chief Panos Panay abandoned ship for Amazon, I have some bad news for you. While Hirani didn't outright confirm they've buried the Surface Connect port in the graveyard, there's a good chance that future Surface refreshes to machines like the Surface Laptop Studios or more budget Surface Go tablets will ditch the magnetic port. “We want [USB-C] to fit into your ecosystem and your lifestyle … we will see more of this behavior as we think beyond this generation.”

A gadget's price for its size matters now more than ever. It seems more companies—including Microsoft—are starting to identify with the need for more capable laptops at prices people can actually afford. The Windows maker just dropped details on its new 12-inch Surface Pro and thinner 13-inch Surface Laptop that seem to fit the bill, at least on paper. With prices starting at under $1,000 (not including the Surface Pro's Flex Keyboard), Microsoft's own brand of computers could hit the sweet spot in the Venn diagram on looks, price, and performance.

See Surface Pro at Amazon

See Surface Pro at Best Buy

The 2025 Surface family includes two very familiar devices. The $900 Surface Laptop with its 13-inch touchscreen (1,920 x 1,280) has a traditional clamshell design, while the $800 Surface Pro 12 is Microsoft's headline-grabbing Windows tablet that converts into a laptop-like device thanks to a detachable keyboard. The new Surface Pro is $200 cheaper than last year's $1,000 11th-gen Surface Pro, but—and here comes the eye roll—you still have to buy a keyboard separately. The screen is also smaller at 12 inches (2,196 x 1,464) compared to the 13-inch display on last year's tablet. The more compact tablet does have a perk: it weighs 1.5 pounds compared to the Pro 11's two pounds.

Both the new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop 13 run on the Snapdragon X Plus chip, Qualcomm's eight-core, ARM-based CPU variant introduced in the middle of 2024. Last year's Surface Pro renditions, alongside the 2024 Surface Laptop, included up to the Snapdragon X Elite chip, which is still Qualcomm's most powerful ARM-based processor. Otherwise, both the new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop come packed with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage at base.

Microsoft says this CPU is supposed to offer a better starting price point and an upgrade path for those on earlier devices like the 2022 Surface Laptop. According to the company, the Snapdragon X Plus chip in the new Surface Laptop is 30% faster than the Intel Core i5-1235U in the 2022 Surface Laptop. Microsoft further claims this CPU can beat the M3 MacBook Air in some benchmarks, but it stopped short of making the same claims about the $1,000 MacBook Air M4. It's more evidence these big tech firms are willing to start competing on pricing that more people can entertain.

The new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop aren't launching with any x86-based Intel chips, though they could arrive later, like with last year's Surface Pro, which received an Intel Lunar Lake version earlier this year. Either way, Microsoft is sticking with Qualcomm's ARM chips that offer better battery life on average, though you'll eventually hit a wall with software compatibility, especially with games or even aging drivers.

The 12-inch Surface Pro will look very familiar if you've used any older version of the hybrid tablet-laptop design. It still includes a built-in kickstand that opens up to sit almost flat on a surface. Other than the shrunken size, the big change this go-around is that the Slim Pen no longer slots into the keyboard (again, sold separately). Instead, the Surface Pro tablet includes an indent in the back for you to slot the stylus. It makes sense, especially for creators who want to use the Surface as a Windows tablet more than a pint-sized PC.

However, you may need to find some dry earth to dig a shallow grave to bury your hoard of Surface Connect power cables. The other big change is the loss of the age-old Surface Connect port. Now, the Surface Pro relies only on USB-C with support for 45W fast charging. The Surface Pro's battery should last around 12 hours based on Microsoft's tests with active web browsing. The Surface Laptop should get closer to 16 hours before requiring a charge.

Just like last year's Surface Pro, the new model paints a pretty picture. The brilliantly blue sapphire color of the 2024 Surface Pro is replaced with a violet color that seems spot-on for spring. Both new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop devices also come in platinum or “ocean” colors. The latter is a blue-ish silver that reminds me way too much of Apple's “Sky Blue” on the MacBook Air M4.

The changes made to the Surface lineup are minimal, but there are some modifications that make sense. If you loathe the idea of losing Surface Connect, Microsoft confirmed it will continue selling last year's Surface models, at least for the near future. The next big question is whether these prices will hold with the overriding threat of Trump tariffs. Microsoft reps told us that “tariffs are a moving target for us” and declined to say more about whether we could see Surface price hikes in the near future.

Uncle Sam wants to see where its AI chips are going.

U.S. Congressman and physicist Bill Foster plans to introduce a bill that will require advanced AI chipmakers like Nvidia to include a built-in location reporting system. According to Reuters, this system will use existing and readily available technology to find the general country-level location of an AI chip. In fact, two sources say that Alphabet is using something similar to track the location of its in-house Tensor AI chips across all its data centers to protect against theft and other security breaches.

The White House, under both the Biden and Trump administrations, has been enforcing bans against the export of advanced chips to China since 2022. It has been doing this to limit its rival's access to cutting-edge technology and help ensure the U.S.'s dominance in AI technology. Washington even recently expanded the export controls to include previously allowed chips like the MI308 and H20, resulting in an $800-million and $5.5-billion write-off for AMD and Nvidia, respectively.

However, the bans and sanctions have been criticized for being ineffective, with the former U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo calling them “a fool's errand”. We've had verified reports of Chinese businesses smuggling advanced chips into mainland China, and the company behind DeepSeek, one of China's most advanced AI models, is accused of using smuggled Nvidia AI chips. Even the U.S. Senate found that the Bureau of Security and Industry (BIS), the agency in charge of export controls, was sorely lacking in resources and relied on voluntary compliance from chipmakers.

Rep. Foster's proposal aims to solve this issue by requiring AI chips to communicate with a secure computer server whenever they go online. According to the source, the time difference between when the chip sends the signal and when the server receives it is enough to determine its rough location. Reuters claims that independent technical experts say that the proposal by the congressman, who is a former particle physicist and has a doctorate in physics from Harvard University, is feasible and could potentially work.

However, the Congressman from Illinois wants to go beyond that. He also wants the chips to stop booting if they detect that they do not have the proper export licenses. This would be significantly more technically challenging than just finding a chip's location, but the representative says that “we can have more detailed discussions with the actual chip and module providers” to know how to implement it.

Requiring these technologies to be built into chips will likely get some pushback, especially when privacy is called into question. Nevertheless, this bill has reportedly bipartisan support, with representatives from both sides of the aisle supporting the concept.

No Surface Connect port to be found

Microsoft has new flagship AI PCs. The company today announced a 13-inch Surface Laptop and a 12-inch Surface Pro with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Plus 8-core processors. These new Copilot+ PCs will be available starting May 20, while business versions will ship on July 22.Both systems share similar specs, including 16GB of RAM and up to 512GB of SSD storage, though the Pro has a faster, higher-resolution display than the Laptop and also comes with Windows Hello support in the webcam, which the laptop relegates to a fingerprint reader.

The Surface Pro 11th Edition and Surface Laptop 7th Edition, which debuted last year with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus (10 Core) processors, each starting at $799.99 as of this writing. Unless the prices for those more powerful models go up, potential buyers may want to consider one of those more powerful systems if they don't care about having the thinnest, lightest designs. It's possible that these Snapdragon X Plus (8 Core) models are priced higher due to tariffs, but Microsoft hasn't commented.Update: May 6, 10:04 a.m. ET: Microsoft's Surface Laptop 13.8 now starts at $999. The Surface Pro 11th Edition still starts at $799.99. The story continues below.

This new Surface Pro is a smaller size than the existing 13-inch device and offers a fanless design. Microsoft claims it's the ""thinnest and lightest Copilot+ PC yet,"" and it seems to fill in the gap left by the Surface Go (the Surface Go 4 was only released for businesses).



This tablet is 1.5 pounds before adding the optional 0.27-pound keyboard. That keyboard, which will be a must-have accessory for many, will start at $149. The $129 Surface Slim pen is also sold separately. Microsoft says that the new keyboard lies flat ""for a grounded and quiet typing experience,"" and that it folds back flat against the Surface Pro for when you want to write or draw.

The new Pro will come in three colors: the default platinum seen on so many Surface devices, a bold new violet, and a dark, blue-green color called ""ocean.""



Perhaps the other biggest physical distinction is that this system won't have Microsoft's proprietary Surface Connect port, instead relying entirely on USB Type-C for charging. In fact, the two USB Type-C 3.2 ports are the only I/O on the entire system.

The system will come with a USB Type-C cable for charging, but it won't include a wall charger in the box. It's possible this is a result of European Union rulings requiring USB-C charging on tablets, meaning that a charger isn't strictly required, like with phones. You'll need at least a 45W charger in order to fast charge the new Surface Pro.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

The Surface Pro has two cameras: a 1080p webcam with support for Windows Hello facial recognition, and a 10MP rear shooter for people who like to take pictures with tablets.

The Surface Pro starts at $799 in platinum with the Snapdragon X Plus (8 core), 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. For $899, you bump up to 512GB of storage and can also get the violent or ocean color options.

The new Surface Laptop, which Microsoft claims is the thinnest and lightest Surface Laptop to date, is a more straightforward update. It's smaller than the existing Surface Laptop, which comes in 13.8-inch and 15-inch screen sizes.



Like the Surface Pro, the new Laptop cuts the Surface Connect port and charges over USB-C. The Surface Laptop has a pair of USB-C 3.2 ports, a USB-A 3.1 port, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. Unlike the tablet, the Surface Laptop will come with a 45W USB-C wall charger in the box (though you need a 60W charger for fast charging).

The laptop's anodized aluminum casing will come in the same violet, ocean, and platinum colorways as the new Surface Pro.



The Surface Laptop has a 1080p webcam like the Pro, but it doesn't support facial recognition. Instead, the Laptop has a fingerprint reader in the power button, similar to the MacBook Air.

Microsoft claims that the Surface Laptop and its Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus (8 core) processor is ""50% faster than Surface Laptop 5 and even outpaces the MacBook Air M3."" While that might be what some users are upgrading from, the Surface Laptop 5 launched in 2022 with 12th Gen Intel processors, while the MacBook Air is now on its next iteration with the M4 chip. Unlike the Surface Pro, Microsoft is using a fan here for improved sustained performance.

Like the Surface Pro, the $899 base model has the 8-core Snapdragon X Plus, 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and only comes in platinum. The $999 configuration that jumps to 512GB of storage also comes in violet or ocean.

Alongside the new Surfaces, Microsoft is announcing a series of new Copilot+ features that will show up in Windows Insider builds over the next month.These include an update to settings to let you use natural language to search for and change settings on your PC. There will also be a new AI-based Snipping Tool to perfectly crop screenshots, a sticker generator in Paint for chats or documents, and more updates to Narrator for better image descriptions. A tool in photos called Relight will let you adjust light sources in photos. This will debut on Snapdragon X Series PCs and come to AMD and Intel later on.Additionally, there will be a redesigned Start Menu that adds a sidebar showing recent activity from your phone, as well as AI actions in File Explorer.Microsoft is continuing to push the Copilot+ as the future of the PC, especially with support for Windows 10 ending on Oct. 14, 2025.

The company has been slowly expanding Copilot+ features that run on the NPU, including launching Recall to find what you previously looked for and an improved Windows Search. AI PCs haven't been a huge boon for upgrades, and despite being called Copilot+, Microsoft's Copilot chatbot doesn't actually run on device. But the clock running out on Windows 10 may drive more sales as potential buyers look for the latest updates, features, and security patches.

When it comes to long-term prosperity in the high-tech world, it's all about setting standards. Intel once set the standard with x86, PCIe, and USB and now the vast majority of devices use these technologies in one way or another. Nvidia now enjoys its investments in the CUDA ecosystem and is setting the standard in AI compute in general. To a large degree, Nvidia's efforts made the U.S. industry the leader in AI. However, containing AI hardware in the U.S. will provoke rapid development of competing AI ecosystems that can eventually outperform the one developed in America.

""We are at an inflection point: the United States needs to decide if it is going to continue to lead the global development and deployment of AI or if we are going to retreat and retrench,"" a remark by Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang (republished by Ray Wang reads) to the U.S. lawmakers reads. ""America cannot lead by slowing down. If we step back, others will step in. And the global AI ecosystem will fragment — technologically, economically, and ideologically.""

For now, Nvidia and its CUDA ecosystem set the standards for AI applications across the world, both for training and for inference. With products like GB200/GB300 NVL72 Nvidia can address companies that need on-premise AI deployments for their AI applications. Given the ubiquity of CUDA, such deployments are easy and relatively inexpensive. Nonetheless, Nvidia has domestic rivals, including traditional competitors like AMD and Intel as well as newcomers like D-Matrix and Tenstorrent. Most of their efforts are aimed at inference though, as Nvidia is the de facto king of AI training thanks to CUDA.

Thanks to the omnipresence of CUDA, Nvidia leads in AI not only in the U.S., but also in Europe and China. The vast majority of China's high-tech giants — Alibaba, ByteDance, Tencent, just to name a few — use Nvidia hardware and virtually all European companies use Nvidia hardware.

Meanwhile, when it comes to China, Nvidia has major rivals both on the hardware and platform sides. On the hardware front, Nvidia has competitors like Biren Technology, InnoSilicon, and Moore Threads. These companies are quite formidable competitors, even though for now their market share is negligible. All three companies use PowerVR GPU IP developed by the U.K.-based Imagination Technologies and have loads of experience with GPU development, according to Jon Peddie, the head of Jon Peddie Research.

The founder of Moore Threads, Zhang Jianzhong (also known as Zhang Jian Zhong), previously worked at Nvidia: he was the general manager of Nvidia's operations in China.

The founder of Biren Technology, Li Bing, previously worked at Huawei and also had experience at other tech companies. Co-CEO of Biren Technology is Allen Lee (also known as Li Xinrong), who used to be vice president and general manager of AMD's China R&D Center. He joined the startup in 2021 as co-CEO, and now he oversees organizational management and product design.

""Li Bing's background and expertise in the tech industry likely influenced his vision for Biren Technology, which focuses on developing high-performance GPUs for various applications,"" Peddie told Tom's Hardware.

But while Biren, InnoSilicon, and Moore Threads have rather good hardware, for now they lack an ecosystem that is comparable to Nvidia's CUDA. However, there is a company in China that can compete with Nvidia not only on the hardware side of matters, but also on the platform level: Huawei. Huawei has its Cloud Matrix 384 system, which it claims can outperform Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 rack-scale machine for AI. Perhaps more importantly, the company has its own AI-oriented, heterogeneous Compute Architecture for Neural Networks (CANN) platform designed specifically to use the potential of Huawei's HiSilicon Ascend AI processors.

Just like Nvidia's CUDA, Huawei's CANN offers a complete suite of development resources such as runtime systems, model-building tools, and compilers. It works with both Huawei's MindSpore platform and widely-used AI libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch, making it flexible for developers. The framework includes a broad range of tuned computational components to speed up model execution and is also compatible with ONNX Runtime, allowing it to run ONNX-based models efficiently on the company's Ascend accelerators for AI.

Although CANN is a key part of Huawei's AI infrastructure, it has drawn criticism for being difficult to work with, mainly due to unstable performance, inadequate documentation, and reliability issues that complicate model training and deployment. Huawei has acknowledged these problems and is actively working to strengthen the platform and improve its usability. For now, imperfection of Huwei's CANN and significant efforts that are required to port programs from CUDA to CANN (several months and hundreds of developers) limit success of Huawei's hardware.

However, if Nvidia's GPUs will be unavailable for Chinese and European buyers, they will at least consider Huawei, or perhaps Biren, Innosilicon, or Moore Threads hardware. This will not only decrease Nvidia's revenues by tens of billions every year and its market capitalization by hundreds of billions, but could also eventually make its competitors from China as trend setters in the AI segment, the company believes.

""Regardless of how one feels about DeepSeek's open-source R1 model, it is a clear indication that innovation is moving rapidly around the world, with or without leading U.S. tech,"" the statement by Nvidia reads. ""If U.S. platforms are absent, companies will turn to strategic competitors like Huawei to fill the gap. This is why leadership in AI depends not just on what we restrict — but on what we enable. Ecosystems are essential. It is not just about who can build the biggest data center or train the most advanced model. […]. One of Nvidia's key strengths is our global network of 6 million developers who build on our platforms. If we lose that ecosystem to our competitors, it will be almost impossible to get it back.""

The new U.S. export rules for compute GPUs — known as the AI Diffusion Rule — come into effect on May 15. Under the Biden administration's AI Diffusion framework, unrestricted access to high-end AI chips like Nvidia's H100 is reserved for companies in the U.S. and a select group of 18 allied countries classified as 'Tier 1.' Companies in 'Tier 2' nations are subject to an annual limit of approximately 50,000 H100-class GPUs, unless they secure verified end user (VEU) approval. They can still import up to 1,700 units per year without a license, and these do not count toward the national quota. However, countries listed as 'Tier 3' — including China, Russia, and Macau — are essentially blocked from receiving such hardware due to arms embargo restrictions. The Trump administration is now reviewing this tier system to make it more straightforward and enforceable, and is rumored to make limitations for Tier 2 nations even stricter.

Not only will Nvidia cease to be able to sell its GPUs to China, which is one of its largest markets, but its Chinese customers will be forced to either use its GPUs in the cloud, or switch to processors developed in China, such as those designed by Huawei or one of the aforementioned companies. While this will slow down development of China's AI sector in the short term, it will give a strong boost for its AI hardware ecosystem in the mid and long-term future. Huawei already spends tens of billions of dollars on R&D every year. Once Huawei and others increase sales of their AI hardware, they will be able to invest more in development of their AI ecosystems, which will get more competitive against those developed by Nvidia and other American companies (such as AMD and Intel) than they are today.

Having China as a fortress and being able to sell its hardware elsewhere, Huawei and other Chinese companies will compete against Nvidia and other American entities for European and Middle-East AI hardware markets. What's more important, they will be able to set standards of the AI market and that will not only reduce Nvidia's influence on such standards, but it will greatly reduce American influence on AI development. AI leadership is about more than market share, it is about strategic control over future governance models.

""Today, the U.S. semiconductor industry is being pushed out of China, the world's largest market,"" the letter by Nvidia concludes. ""On May 15th, if the AI Diffusion Rule comes into effect without significant changes, we will be forced to similarly retreat from the rest of the world.""

The U.S. has already seen the consequences of ceding technological leadership, when Huawei gained a dominant foothold in global 5G deployments by offering cheaper and faster-to-deploy infrastructure. This serves as a cautionary example of how losing control over foundational standards can shift both market power and geopolitical influence. Nevertheless, whether the current administration has learnt from similar past mistakes remains to be seen.

Time for an upgrade. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The official release notes for Nvidia's CUDA 12.9 Toolkit explicitly indicate that the next major release will no longer support Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta-based GPUs. Note that this deprecation is only limited to the compute side, as these GPUs will likely continue receiving normal GeForce drivers for the time being. That being said, this is likely the last SDK version that can be used to develop CUDA applications targeting the aforementioned architectures.

While the previous release hinted at this change, Nvidia's stronger wording now serves as a definitive signal for developers to shift to more modern architectures. CUDA 12.x series (and before) will still allow application development for these GPUs. The deprecation targets offline compilation and library support. Essentially, future CUDA compilers (nvcc) will lack the ability to generate machine code compatible with these GPUs. In the same vein, upcoming versions of CUDA-accelerated libraries like cuBLAS, cuDNN, etc., will not offer support for GPUs built using these architectures.

Nvidia has not specified an exact date for the upcoming major release (likely CUDA 13.x). Similarly, we aren't sure how many interim releases are to follow in the 12.9.x branch. Either way, this is quite a significant change as Nvidia is dropping three major architectures with one swing. Volta's consumer equivalent Turing (RTX 20) is next in line, but it likely has a lot more to offer before it too hits the chopping block.

""Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta architectures are now feature-complete with no further enhancements planned. While CUDA Toolkit 12.x series will continue to support building applications for these architectures, offline compilation and library support will be removed in the next major CUDA Toolkit version release. Users should plan migration to newer architectures, as future toolkits will be unable to target Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPUs.""

Nvidia's Maxwell architecture was introduced in early 2014 with the GTX 745, GTX 750, and GTX 750 Ti series, along with the GTX 800M series on mobile. Maxwell even found its way into the original Nintendo Switch's Tegra SoC. A refresh later in 2014, featuring the GM20X series dies, brought several enhancements with the GTX 900 series. Pascal was soon to follow in 2016, serving as the basis for the legendary GTX 1080 Ti, and powering the Quadro P-series for workstations (mobile and desktop) along with Nvidia's Tesla P4 accelerators.

Most consumers might not be familiar with the name Volta, but this architecture marked the debut of Nvidia's Tensor Cores in 2017. Fun fact, the Volta-based GV100 is Nvidia's second-largest chip at 815mm2, only second to the monstrous GA100 (Ampere) at 826mm2. Volta would serve as the stepping stone for Nvidia's strides into the AI acceleration market, followed by Turing, Ampere, Hopper, and now Blackwell, which have since grown its valuation to nearly $2.8 trillion.

 May 06, 2025  

INCHEON, South Korea — A shoe-based biomechanical intervention worn for a short time each day may achieve greater improvements in low back pain and greater reductions in the risk for total knee replacement surgery than standard physical therapy, according to two studies presented at the World Congress on Osteoarthritis (OARSI) 2025 Annual Meeting.

“If you've ever watched somebody who has pain — whether it's knee pain, hip pain, back pain — they walk a little strange,” said presenter Matthew Bartels, MD, MPH, director of Rehabilitation Medicine and professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. But walking differently to compensate for pain can actually make the problem worse, directing the ground force through the affected area of the body, whether the knee or lower back.

Bartels presented data from two studies of the US Food and Drug Administration–cleared shoe-based intervention, which “alters the foot's pressure points to reduce loads, minimize symptoms, and promote neuromuscular control training using adjustable, convex pods under the sole,” according to the researchers.

The first was a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of the intervention and standard physical therapy on pain in 162 patients with low back pain. Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio either to the shoe-based intervention from AposHealth — which was individually tailored and calibrated six times over 1 year — or to standard physical therapy. In addition to being presented at OARSI, the trial was recently published in Global Spine Journal.

At 1 year after randomization, those who used the shoe-based intervention reported a significantly greater mean 3.5-point reduction in their pain scores, as measured on a 10-point numeric rating scale, compared with a mean 1.8-point reduction in those who received physical therapy.

The participants in the intervention also reported better secondary outcomes, including greater improvements in their Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System function scores, gait speed, and overall quality of life.

Bartels told Medscape Medical News that the intervention was likely to have greater compliance than physical therapy because patients could use it at home for as little as 15 minutes at a time and feel the benefits pretty quickly.

“We all know that if you have knee or back pain, physical therapy will make you better, but the problem is, people don't keep the exercises up,” he said. “This is a treatment that you put the shoes on, and you just wear them doing normal activities for a period, so it doesn't take time out of your day.”

Bartels' own experience of his patients using the shoes was that even if patients did stop wearing them once their symptoms improved, they often started using them again if their symptoms returned, “so they kind of self-dose,” he said.

The second study Bartels presented was a poster detailing the results of a retrospective registry review of 95 patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) who had been prescribed the shoe intervention after exhausting other nonsurgical options to see whether it was associated with a reduction in the likelihood of total knee replacement surgery. The study was also published last year in the Journal of Musculoskeletal Research.

After an average follow-up time of 5.6 years, 12.6% of the patients using the shoe had undergone total knee replacement compared with 34.3% of a control group of patients from the same period who received traditional physical therapy.

“Increased use of biomechanical intervention to treat knee OA may help reduce some of the burden on healthcare and society associated with end-stage knee OA by delaying or avoiding surgery,” the researchers wrote.

Commenting on the two studies, physical therapist and epidemiologist Garrett Bullock, PhD, DPT, of Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, said, “For a specific type of patient that has tried exercise interventions, has tried medication interventions, and a combination of both, that has a decent amount of physical activity, it may be something to explore, particularly to maintain neutral balance or create a better line through the foot.”

Bullock told Medscape Medical News that there was always a risk that patients wouldn't adhere to physical therapy, so an intervention that provided education and the tools for self-efficacy could help them to manage their own symptoms.

The clinical study was supported by AposHealth, which provided devices for the conduct of the trial. No conflicts of interest were declared by Bartels or Bullock.

 May 06, 2025  

INCHEON, South Korea — Defining early knee osteoarthritis (OA) as people who do not have symptoms but do have radiographic or MRI changes could offer greater opportunity for interventions to prevent symptomatic or structural decline, a speaker argued at the World Congress on Osteoarthritis (OARSI) 2025 Annual Meeting.

Rheumatologist and Epidemiologist Grace Hsiao-Wei Lo, MD, MS, an associate professor in the Section of Immunology, Allergy, and Rheumatology at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, explored how the concepts of early OA and pre-OA could be defined, and what those definitions mean for understanding, research, and prevention of the disease.

“Early osteoarthritis is a term that means a lot in the research community,” Lo said. “However, there's not a consensus on what this construct should mean.”

That lack of consensus could be impeding the development of disease-modifying OA drugs, if it meant that interventions were being tested in individuals who actually had late disease, not early disease. “If we change our focus to an earlier part of the natural history of the disease, then we might be more successful,” she said.

However, the challenge is that there are a range of possible definitions for early OA, and it's not clear which ones are mostly predictive of progression to clinical disease, defined as Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grade 2 or above: Formation of osteophytes, narrowing of the joint cartilage, and sclerosis of the subchondral bone.

In people with KL grade disease of 0 or 1, numerous studies have found pathological evidence of disease on x-ray or MRI, Lo said.

For example, a 2014 MRI study by Leena Sharma and colleagues found that among people who had a KL grade of 0 for both knees, 76% had articular cartilage damage, 61% had bone marrow lesions, and 21% had meniscal tear. Those with more evidence of disease on MRI were more likely to have persistent symptoms of knee OA and cartilage damage. Lo said this indicated that even people without radiographic evidence of disease could have changes on MRI.

“It tells us that we know there are radiographic changes that are typical for osteoarthritis, that there are MRI features of osteoarthritis that can be seen in these without radiographic evidence of disease, that these features are meaningful and that there's no one MRI feature that seemed to be the penultimate predictor for developing KL grade 2,” Lo told the audience.

Another MRI study by Alison H. Chang and colleagues from 2024 took individuals at increased risk of developing symptomatic radiographic knee OA — by virtue of injury, symptoms, family history, or overweight or obesity — and looked at whether MRI evidence at baseline predicted their progression to symptomatic radiographic disease.

“The context here is to look for people who have a particular pathology on MRI, ideally looking for people without symptoms and limitations, and generally we're looking for people with early disease who don't meet the definition of radiographic osteoarthritis,” Lo said.

This study found that some combinations of MRI changes were associated with progression but not everyone with those combinations did progress. “I would argue that we expect people to go through the different phases of the disease,” Lo said. “But the hope is that if we can identify people earlier in the natural history, what we're trying to do is stop the progression of disease.”

Another phenotype of early disease is in individuals who did have radiographic evidence of disease but without symptoms. Here, Lo cited a study she was involved in, which looked at the predictive value of crepitus in individuals without symptomatic knee OA at baseline.

This study found that patient-reported knee crepitus predicted the development of symptomatic OA, and most of those who went on to symptomatic disease were those with preexisting radiographic evidence of disease. “This made sense if you believe that people have to have some pathology before they develop symptoms,” Lo said.

Another possible phenotype of early OA is in people without MRI changes, without radiographic changes, and without symptoms, but who have elevated levels of an as-yet unidentified biomarker.

Lo also touched on the idea of pre-OA, and whether it might be possible to find people in whom interventions could prevent symptoms or structural progression. One possible group are those who have experienced anterior cruciate ligament injury, as there was growing evidence they were at elevated risk for knee OA. “Targeting the people who have had ACL tear is an opportunity to address people who have pre-OA,” she said.

Lo told the audience that these definitions of early OA weren't the only ones out there, but did give an opportunity to potentially enrich clinical trials and observational studies with individuals who were most likely to have outcomes of interest. “The only way that we can really clarify which definition, or maybe definitions, are the most useful is for us to really systematically evaluate many of them,” she said.

Speaking to Medscape Medical News, Lo said part of the problem is that we don't know what counts as the beginning of OA. “People pretty uniformly agree that once you have KL2, everybody agrees that that's established disease, but before that there's a lot of disagreement on what counts as a diagnosis of early osteoarthritis,” she said.

But finding individuals with early disease has opened the door to early interventions, she said, pointing to evidence that something as simple as walking might reduce the risk of people progressing to clinical OA.

Commenting on the presentation, Physiotherapist Brooke Patterson, PhD, of La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia, said there was great interest in defining early OA and pre-OA, particularly for younger individuals with sports-related knee injuries that might increase their risk for OA. “For these young people that are getting the burden of the disease in their 30s and 40s and then having knee replacements,” it's important for us to talk about it, she said to Medscape Medical News.

Lo and Patterson had no relevant conflicts of interest to declare.

 May 06, 2025  

Measles was officially eliminated in the United States in 2000. A quarter of a century later, with outbreaks currently underway in several states, the country is at risk of losing its elimination status. And in little more than two decades, measles could be endemic again.

This outcome is not far-fetched but the result of a modeling study led by Stanford University researchers and published in JAMA last month. According to the findings, with current levels of immunization, measles would return to endemic status in the United States within two decades, with more than 850,000 cases in 25 years. A decline in rates of immunization would lead to millions of cases, the researchers said.

The widespread return of measles would pose a challenge to the healthcare system, and in particular to primary care physicians, who would be on the frontline of the epidemic, handling hundreds of thousands of measles cases — if not many millions. “The healthcare delivery system is not prepared for the resurgence of measles,” said Jay Varma, MD, an epidemiologist and primary care physician with Community Healthcare Network, New York City.

The first immediate burden to the healthcare system would be pressure on hospital capacity, similar to what occurred during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, albeit on a potentially even more serious scale, given that measles is about twice as contagious as COVID-19. Up to 1 in 5 cases of measles could lead to a hospital stay, typically for complications of pneumonia, dehydration, and, in rare cases, encephalitis.

Other challenges would emerge for physicians and healthcare workers, starting with the basics: Disease awareness. “I entered medical school in 1993, and I did not see a single case of measles in all of my medical training,” Varma said. “Most physicians who are practicing today [in the US] have never managed a case of measles.”

The issue is more complex than simply diagnosing a measles rash, he said, or being up to speed on the best and fastest tests to administer. Managing the high virality of measles presents its own set of challenges. For instance, Varma said, clinics may need to stock upon more vaccines than are needed for routine immunization, as well as immunoglobulin, in order to catch up with unvaccinated family members of infected people, and they may not be immediately available.

Doctors and healthcare workers would also be at a higher risk themselves, and possibly without sufficient resources to mitigate risk. Technologies such as air filtration and protective equipment aren't always widespread, and the concentration of contagious people in crowded spaces, such as urgent care clinics or emergency departments, would expose even vaccinated healthcare providers to additional risk.

With 97% protection on a population basis, the vaccine is highly effective, but being repeatedly exposed to sick people increases the risk of infection. “I don't worry too much about vaccinated people getting measles,” Varma said. “But I do worry — just like in my home, even if I have a lock on the door and an alarm system, it still doesn't mean I'm at zero risk if I live in an area where crime has suddenly gotten worse.”

Doctors who treat immunocompromised people would see their patients face additional risks. Further, most patients vaccinated before 1989, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Immunization Practices Advisory Committee recommended a two-dose protocol, may have reduced protection.

But the lion's share of the burden would fall on pediatricians, who treat the most vulnerable patients: Infants.

“From my perspective, the real risk of any measles transmission in the US is the risk to infants,” said Nina Schwalbe, PhD, MPH, the CEO of Spark Street Advisors, a health think tank based in New York City.

Infants under a year are typically not vaccinated unless an outbreak is ongoing or they have a specific travel risk, and while maternal antibodies offer some protection, that generally wanes after 6 months. “Infants are definitely at risk even now,” Schwalbe said. “We don't have to wait 25 years to see the impact of undervaccination on measles and the resulting risk of infant hospitalization. Any transmission poses an immediate and deadly risk.”

For every child who has measles, said Varma, there may be unvaccinated siblings in need of vaccination and additional risks for the youngest patients in pediatric practices. The measles virus is airborne for up to 2 hours and can survive on surfaces for a few hours more, increasing the need for sanitizing medical settings far more thoroughly than with infections such as COVID-19, as measles is much more contagious.

Measles isn't only an acute infection. Although rare, it can lead to long-term neurologic sequelae, and with enough cases, their incidence would be significant, too. If the rates of vaccination were halved, the Stanford model found, more than 51,000 children would experience postmeasles neurologic issues.

This would pose additional challenges to clinicians, who would have to be able to reconduct many neurologic symptoms of an earlier measles infection.

“Measles can cause severe neurological complications within a week and months after the diagnosis, and sometimes over a decade after,” Varma said. “The average clinician is now going to have to remind themselves of the varying degrees of neurological complications that include everything from encephalitis to hearing loss to blindness and other conditions.”

The paper also looked at other diseases — polio, rubella, and diphtheria — which would also increase, though not become endemic, under the current vaccination rates. Though their infectiousness is lower, and the caseload would not be comparable with measles, the risk for longer-term disability is higher.

In particular, rubella contracted during pregnancy can cause congenital rubella syndrome — presenting as many potential birth defects and developmental delays — in the child. Diphtheria can cause long-term damage to the lungs, heart, and nerves, with a higher risk for conditions such as breathing difficulties, heart failure, and paralysis. Poliomyelitis can lead to paralysis in as many as 1 in 200 infections. Reduction of current vaccination rates would lead to thousands of long-term disability cases.

When it comes to the caseload the United States may see in the next decades and the public health implications, the numbers are striking. Endemicity has several definitions, said Nathan Lo, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at Stanford University in Stanford, California, and the senior author of the JAMA paper.

The definition the researchers adopted in this modeling considers the benchmark of 100,000 locally acquired cases in a year. At current vaccination levels, endemicity would occur by 2043. Within 5 years from that point, the overall number of cases would surpass 850,000, leading to 170,000 hospitalizations and 2500 deaths, according to the model. This estimate is based on a conservative rate of infection that links each case to 12 more cases, although a single measles case typically causes up to 20 or more.

Should immunization rates follow the pattern of the past few years and continue their decline, the United States would face a disastrous increase in measles infections, the researchers found. A 10% decline over 25 years would lead to over 11 million new cases of the disease. For reference, vaccine coverage declined by 2.5 percentage points between 2019-2020 and 2023-2024.

According to Schwalbe, the findings of the paper are susceptible to changes in policy and can't be considered highly predictive. “There would be dramatic differences by state. For example, it is difficult to imagine any scenario where New York would change its vaccine schedule or walk back from current policy,” she said. On the other hand, even in states with lower vaccination rates, “once there are more measles and people see the consequences, policy could easily change back, including requiring catch-up campaigns, for instance, in order to attend school.”

Indeed, Lo said variations by state and changes in policy — including potential changes to the current vaccine schedule — would have an important impact on the epidemiology. “States with lower amounts of historical vaccination and immunity are more at risk; that's pretty straightforward,” in particular when lower vaccination rates are paired with high natality, he said. But risk is higher too in densely populated cities, in particular ones with a lot of tourism and a population exposed to international travelers.

“That increases the chance that someone gets infected with measles internationally and comes back to the US, and because measles is not endemic, the only way outbreaks and endemicity starts is if someone brings measles from another country,” he said.

Yet as caseload increases, differences between states may become less significant. “At a certain point, once you get really high amounts of cases, the entire US is at risk,” Lo said.

But there is good news.

While even a small decrease in vaccination could be catastrophic, Lo said, an even smaller increase in immunization coverage would drastically bring down the caseload to only 5800 over 25 years.

“I think it's empowering that small percentages of the population can make a positive difference in protecting their communities against measles,” Lo said.

Pregnancy-related complications are the leading cause of death globally among girls aged 15-19 years. In response, the World Health Organization (WHO) has updated its guidelines aimed at preventing adolescent pregnancy and mitigating its health impacts.

While teen pregnancy is a worldwide issue, it is especially critical in low- and middle-income countries. Each year, an estimated 21 million adolescent girls in these regions become pregnant — half of these pregnancies are unplanned.

Beyond the significant health risks — including increased rates of infection, preterm birth, and complications from unsafe abortions — adolescent pregnancy also leads to major social consequences. Early pregnancies often interrupt education and social development, contributing to long-term cycles of poverty and exclusion across generations.

“Early pregnancies can have serious physical and psychological consequences for girls and young women, and often reflect deep-rooted inequalities that limit their ability to shape their own relationships and life choices,” said Pascale Allotey, PhD, director of WHO's Department of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research and of the United Nations's Special Program of Research, Development, and Research Training in Human Reproduction.

“Tackling this issue means creating environments in which girls and young women can thrive — ensuring they remain in school, are protected from violence and coercion, and have access to sexual and reproductive health services that respect their rights and allow them to make informed choices about their futures,” she added.

Adolescent pregnancy is influenced by a range of factors, including social and economic vulnerability, gender inequality, and barriers to accessing sexual and reproductive health services. In some countries, these services are only available with parental or guardian consent, which can further restrict access.

There is also a well-established connection between teen pregnancy and child marriage. In low- and middle-income countries, approximately 90% of adolescent mothers were married before the age of 18 years.

In light of this, the updated WHO guideline calls for urgent global action to end child marriage. It recommends multisectoral efforts to provide meaningful alternatives to early marriage, such as expanding girls' access to education and improving their long-term prospects. Increased school enrollment and completion have been shown to reduce the likelihood of early unions. For adolescents at higher risk, the guidance suggests providing targeted support — such as scholarships or financial incentives — to help them remain in school through secondary education.

The WHO also recommends that countries adopt legislation prohibiting marriage before the age of 18 years.

“Early marriage robs girls of their childhood and has severe consequences for their health,” said Sheri Bastien, PhD, adolescent sexual and reproductive health scientist at WHO. “Education is fundamental to changing the future of girls. At the same time, adolescents — both boys and girls — must be empowered to understand consent, take care of their health, and challenge the entrenched gender inequalities that continue to drive high rates of child marriage and early pregnancy in many parts of the world.”

The updated guideline highlights the importance of providing comprehensive, age-appropriate sexual and reproductive health education for adolescents of all genders. Evidence shows that such education can help prevent teenage pregnancies and delay the initiation of sexual activity.

WHO also emphasizes the need for adolescents to have access to contraceptive methods, along with proper guidance on their correct use.

Experts further stress that pregnant adolescents — who frequently face stigma and discrimination — must receive high-quality, respectful healthcare. This includes access to safe abortion services where legally permitted.

The newly published guideline updates the original 2011 edition, incorporating over a decade of new research and field experience. It reflects growing calls — both within and beyond WHO — for more robust and evidence-based strategies to address adolescent pregnancy.

Despite persistent challenges, global progress has been made. Between 2000 and 2021, the adolescent birth rate declined from 64.5-42.5 births per 1000 girls aged 15-19 years.

However, significant regional disparities remain. The most notable declines were observed in South, Central, and West Asia, as well as North Africa. In contrast, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean continue to have the highest adolescent birth rates — 101 and 53.2 births per 1000 adolescent girls, respectively, in 2021.

The report also notes substantial differences within individual regions and countries. For example, in Latin America and the Caribbean, Nicaragua reported 85.6 births per 1000 adolescent girls in 2021 compared with 24.1 per 1000 in Chile.

Adding pembrolizumab to standard-of-care treatment improved event-free survival (EFS) in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), according to new results of the KEYNOTE-689 trial.

“This new information supports changing the current standard of care to now include neoadjuvant and adjuvant pembrolizumab. For the first time in more than 20 years, patients with this challenging disease have a new therapeutic approach,” said lead investigator Ravindra Uppaluri, MD, PhD, head and neck surgical oncologist, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2025.

Pembrolizumab — which already carries indications for unresectable/metastatic HNSCC — is currently under review by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a perioperative HNSCC indication based on the trial. A decision is expected by June 23, 2025.

KEYNOTE-689 trial randomized 714 patients with stage III-IVa HNSCC; almost all patients were human papillomavirus–negative, about equally to either standard-of-care treatment — surgery followed by radiation plus chemotherapy for high-risk features on pathology — or standard of care plus perioperative pembrolizumab.

The perioperative regimen included two 3-week cycles of 200 mg neoadjuvant pembrolizumab followed by surgery, then three cycles of pembrolizumab concurrent with radiation plus/minus cisplatin, with 12 cycles of maintenance pembrolizumab afterward.

At a median follow-up of 38.3 months, EFS — defined as no recurrence or death — was a median of 59.7 months in the pembrolizumab arm, compared with 26.9 months in those receiving standard of care alone arm among the 465 patients with a programmed death ligand 1 combined positive score combined positive score (CPS) of ≥ 10. Similar results were seen among patients with a CPS of ≥ 1, with EFS of 59.7 months vs 29.6 months for the pembrolizumab vs standard of care alone groups, respectively. Across all patients, including the less than 5% of those patients with a CPS < 1, EFS was 51.8 months with perioperative pembrolizumab vs 30.4 months without it.

Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab also seemed to downstage tumors; a third of pembrolizumab patients had high-risk features — for instance, positive margins or extranodal involvement — on surgical pathology vs 44.4% in the standard of care arm. Subsequently, the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in the pembrolizumab group was lower at 29.6% vs 44.1%.

With pembrolizumab, 13.7% of patients with a CPS of ≥ 10, 9.8% of those with a CPS of ≥ 1, and 9.3% of all patients had a major pathologic response, defined as a tumor reduction of 90% or more.

Median overall survival has not been reached in the pembrolizumab add-on group, but it was 61.8 months in the standard of care arm. Follow-up for overall survival is ongoing.

“I think this trial does constitute a leap forward and a new standard of care,” said study discussant Robert Ferris, MD, PhD, a head and neck surgical oncologist at UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

However, “we have a great deal of new things we need to do” to get the most from the approach, he said.

For one, the hazard ratio for EFS benefit among 528 stage IVa patients was not statistically significant, so further study is necessary to identify stage IVa patients who do benefit, he said. Further work is also needed to identify the optimal treatment after progression, the risk for hyperprogression during programmed cell death 1 monotherapy, and the possibility of deintensifying surgery if patients who respond strongly to neoadjuvant treatment can be identified. It's also unknown if adjuvant pembrolizumab is best given with chemoradiation or afterward, Ferris said. Some studies have shown benefit by separating them, he added.

There might be a role for combining neoadjuvant pembrolizumab with chemotherapy or another immunotherapy, but further research is needed, noted Uppaluri. He added that it's unclear how long the maintenance phase of pembrolizumab should be, and the study did not address whether patients need pembrolizumab both before and after surgery, or if one or the other will do.

The FDA has also raised the question about the need for treatment on both sides of surgery in other perioperative immunotherapy trials. Ferris and Uppaluri said they both look forward to future related investigations for clarity.

The grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse event rate was 44.6% with pembrolizumab add-on vs 42.9% without it. Immune-mediated adverse events occurred in 43.2% of pembrolizumab patients, most commonly hypothyroidism in 24.7%; grade 3 or higher immune-mediated adverse events occurred in 10%, including one fatal case of pneumonitis. There were four fatal adverse events with the pembrolizumab add-on and one in the standard-of-care group.

The work was funded by Merck, manufacturer of pembrolizumab, and KEYNOTE-689 investigators included Merck employees. Uppaluri reported receiving research funding and consulting fees from the company. Ferris is a Merck advisor.

Before starting clerkships, every medical student should shift their mindset from student to team member. 

Many students see their role as just being there to learn, but in the hospital, there's actually an opportunity to contribute. You can't do that if you're just standing in the corner observing.The real learning happens in the action. 

When you actively participate, you don't just learn the medicine better, but you also learn how to function in a team. That's what earns you stronger evaluations, but more importantly, it's what prepares you for residency where being a strong team member directly impacts the patient's care.

Students can sometimes be burdensome, but team members are almost always helpful.

Clinical remission was achieved and sustained in nearly one third of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA) receiving benralizumab for up to 2 years, with better outcomes in biologic-naive patients than in biologic-experienced patients.

“Outcomes were maintained irrespective of previous biologic use and key baseline characteristics that clinicians typically consider in their therapeutic decision-making. Patients with lower disease burden were more likely to achieve clinical remission, reinforcing the importance of early treatment intervention,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Girolamo Pelaia, MD, Università Magna Graecia in Catanzaro, Italy. It was published online on April 19, 2025, in CHEST.

This study lacked a control arm. The limited availability of data on lung function restricted its inclusion in the remission composite. The COVID-19 pandemic overlapped with the period of data collection, potentially affecting outcomes.

This study was supported by AstraZeneca. Several authors reported being employees of and owning stock in AstraZeneca. Some others reported having other ties with AstraZeneca and various sources.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Welcome to Impact Factor, your weekly dose of commentary on a new medical study. I'm Dr F. Perry Wilson from the Yale School of Medicine.

A 77-year-old man with some cholesterol issues, but otherwise healthy, feels a fluttering sensation in his chest, along with some shortness of breath. It's disquieting but not painful. It persists for an hour or so and then seems to go away on its own. The next day it happens again, and his wife finally convinces him to call his doctor. He goes into the office where a 12-lead EKG is placed and the diagnosis is made clear: atrial fibrillation (AFib), the most common arrhythmia in the world. 

That is how AFib used to be diagnosed: a symptom, a doctor's visit, an EKG. It is data from people diagnosed in that way that gave us all our guidelines about how to treat AFib — rate control with beta-blockers, anticoagulants, and so on.

But that's not really how AFib is getting diagnosed anymore. Now, that whole process is boiled down to a smartwatch notification.

Whether we realize it or not, we are in a whole new world of medical diagnosis. The era of waiting for a symptom to develop and having a doctor order a diagnostic test is rapidly coming to an end. We have multiple consumer-facing products that give real information about health status, from blood pressure to blood sugar. We have direct-to-consumer testing ranging from genetics to cancer screening. 

We have machine learning models that can look at your prior data and make predictions about your future health without you ever setting foot in a doctor's office.

Is that a good thing? Let's take the AFib example. Your smartwatch tells you it thinks you have AFib. You are having no symptoms whatsoever. We call this “subclinical AFib.” What emotions are you feeling? Anxiety over a new medical problem? Relief that it was caught? Are you glad you had the watch on or is ignorance bliss?

To remove this from the realm of emotion, I will make the argument that detection of a disease is only important insofar as it can be treated. And I'll go one step further to say that early detection of a disease is only important insofar as early treatment provides better outcomes than late treatment.

So, how do we treat AFib?

Well, in the old “visit your doctor” days, we knew just what to do. We calculated your risk for stroke based on something like the classic CHA2DS2-VASc score, and if the stroke risk was high enough — usually 2 or higher — we put you on a blood thinner.

But blood thinners aren't exactly gummy vitamins. The data are quite clear that, among people with AFib detected the old-fashioned way, blood thinners reduce the risk for stroke. But they come at a cost, and that cost is bleeding.

Risk/benefit. As ever. For always. This is why we estimate stroke risk before prescribing blood thinners; if it is very low, the benefit is not worth the risk.

But what about people whose AFib is detected in the new way, the smartwatch cohort? What about their risk?

We can actually answer this question now, thanks to two randomized trials — the ARTESIA and NOAH-AFNET 6 studies — that specifically evaluated whether anticoagulation was useful in people with what they call “device detected subclinical atrial fibrillation.” This would include smartwatch types but also people with other devices, like pacemakers, that might be able to detect AFib incidentally. 

The studies differed in their primary results. ARTESIA showed that the use of a blood thinner reduced the risk for stroke but increased the risk for major bleeding. NOAH-AFNET showed that the use of blood thinner had minimal effect on the risk for stroke but increased the risk for major bleeding.

Benefit and risk.

Putting the data together, the benefit in terms of reducing stroke seems rather small, and the risk for bleeding is clear and real, but, how do you compare those things? What's worse — a stroke or bleeding? Or, to make the question even harder, how many bleeding episodes are equal to one stroke? 

Finally, this week we got a really interesting approach to answer that question, thanks to this study appearing in JAMA Network Open, which integrates not only the two big trials of blood thinners for subclinical AFib, but also the risk for stroke with the risk for bleeding. Here's how it worked.

The study was done using a computer. I know — all studies are done with computers. But here I mean literally. The authors simulated 20,000 individuals in a computer. All of them were basically the average of patients in the NOAH and ARTESIA trials — around 77 years old — and had the same baseline risk for stroke, bleeding, and death from other causes as the control group in those trials, which is to say about 1% for strokes and bleeds and 4.3% per year for death from other causes. Half of the virtual humans with subclinical AFib would get blood thinners and half wouldn't. 

The researchers also assumed that the effect of treating these people would be the average effect seen in those trials — to wit, reducing the risk for stroke by 32% and increasing the risk for bleeding by 62%.

With that, they could run these 20,000 little silicon beings through a web of potential changes in health status — this is called a Markov chain — all with various probabilities. 

Basically, they tell the computer to skip forward a month at a time. Everyone starts out healthy. After a month, most people are still healthy; strokes and bleeding and death are rare events, after all. But some people experience one of those outcomes. And then time leaps forward again, and some more people experience those outcomes, and maybe some of the people from the past month get better and some people develop overt atrial fibrillation and go on the old-fashioned ""see your doctor"" pathway. It's all driven by probability.

And they didn't just capture whether the people would have a stroke or a bleed or not; they captured how bad it would be in terms of quality of life. This is how you start to compare apples and oranges. A stroke can be devastating to quality of life. But bleeding can be as well, particularly bleeding in the brain. With every cycle of the simulation, we know how these 20,000 people are doing not just in terms of whether they are alive, but in terms of their quality of life.

With that set up, you can ask a really straightforward question: If I take a healthy person with subclinical AFib, will their quality of life be better over the next 10 years if I treat them with a blood thinner or if I don't?

With 20,000 patients iterating in silicon, over the 10-year virtual time scale, you'd see 1076 strokes if you didn't treat with a blood thinner and 843 strokes if you did. That's good. But treatment would net you an additional 453 major bleeding events. That's bad. Treatment would lead to 55 fewer deaths. That's good.

But for an individual person, what is the answer? With treatment, do you live longer and with better quality of life? 

Well, over 10 years, treating someone whose smartwatch tells them they have AFib with a blood thinner will increase their lifespan — by 9 days. It will also increase their quality-adjusted life — by 9 days.

Nine days over 10 years of treatment. A net benefit, but, come on. Nine days?

Now, I know what you're thinking. We don't just blindly treat everyone, even when they are diagnosed with AFib the old-fashioned way; we treat them based on their stroke risk. Well, the authors could give these simulated patients any stroke risk they wanted. At the high end of risk, treatment with a blood thinner improved quality-adjusted life duration by 11 days. 

It is very hard for me to look at this data and conclude that we should be treating subclinical AFib with these drugs. Of course, this is one of those “talk to your doctor” situations. The risk/benefit paradigm requires some personal reflection about risk tolerance as well as thinking through the implications of a stroke and the implications of a major bleed. In a larger sense, this study is emblematic of a problem we'll face in this new direct-to-consumer medical economy. Every medical decision is based on the risk vs the benefit of treatment, but our understanding of risk comes from a dying paradigm of diagnostic care that occurs in the doctor's office. People diagnosing themselves almost certainly have lower risk than those who make it to the clinic, which changes the treatment calculus substantially.

That said, for me at least, there is something disconcerting about knowing that something is going on with my heart and doing nothing about it, even if that is the rational choice. I feel like it would nag at me. The AFib alert on your smartwatch is a genie that can't really be put back in the bottle. People may want to think about turning that functionality off. As a great computer once said, “The only winning move is not to play.”

SAN DIEGO — Molecular residual disease (MRD) positivity, as detected via circulating tumor (ct) DNA following curative resection, was significantly associated with improved disease-free survival after chemotherapy in patients with stage II or III colorectal cancer (CRC), the results of the BESPOKE study showed.

“These findings highlight the value of utilizing ctDNA to select which patients should receive management chemotherapy and which patients can be potentially spared chemotherapy's physical, emotional, and financial toxicities without compromising their long-term outcomes,” said first author Kim Magee, of Natera, Inc., in Austin, Texas.

“ctDNA is emerging as the most powerful and prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer,” said Magee, who presented the findings at Digestive Disease Week (DDW) 2025.

In stage II CRC, as many as 80% of patients are cured by surgery alone, while only about 5% benefit from chemotherapy. In stage III CRC, about half of patients are cured by surgery alone, while only 20% benefit from chemotherapy, and 30% recur despite chemotherapy, Magee explained.

The inability to pinpoint which patients will most benefit from chemotherapy means “we know we are needlessly treating [many] of these patients,” she said.

Just as cells release fragments (cell-free DNA) into the blood as they regenerate, tumor cells also release fragments — ctDNA — which can represent a biomarker of a cancer's current state, Magee explained.

Because the DNA fragments have a half-life of only about 2 hours, they represent a key snapshot in real time, “as opposed to imaging, which can take several weeks or months to show changes,” she said.

To determine the effects of ctDNA testing on treatment decisions and asymptomatic recurrence rates, Magee and colleagues analyzed data from the multicenter, prospective study, which used the Signatera (Natera, Inc.) residual disease test.

The study included 1794 patients with resected stage II-III CRC who were treated with the standard of care between May 2020 and March 2023 who had complete clinical and laboratory data available.

ctDNA was collected 2-6 weeks post-surgery and at surveillance months 2, 4, 6, and every 3 months through month 24.

Among the 1166 patients included in a final analysis, 694 (59.5%) patients received adjunctive chemotherapy, and 472 (40.5%) received no chemotherapy.

Among those with stage II CRC, a postoperative MRD positivity rate was 7.54%, while the rate in those with stage III disease was 28.35%.

Overall, 16.1% of patients had a recurrence by the trial end at 24 months.

The results showed that among patients who tested negative for ctDNA, the disease-free survival estimates were highly favorable, at 91.8% for stage II and 87.4% for stage III CRC.

Comparatively, for those who were ctDNA-positive, disease-free survival rates were just 45.9% and 35.5%, respectively, regardless of whether those patients received adjunctive chemotherapy.

At the study's first ctDNA surveillance timepoint, patients who were ctDNA-positive with stage II and III CRC combined had substantially worse disease-free survival than patients who were ctDNA-negative (HR, 26.4; P < .0001).

Patients who were found to be MRD-positive on ctDNA testing and treated with chemotherapy had a 40.3% 2-year disease-free survival rate compared with just 24.7% among patients with MRD-positive who did not receive chemotherapy.

Meanwhile, those who were MRD-negative and treated with chemotherapy had a substantially higher 2-year disease-free survival rate of 89.7% — nearly identical to the 89.5% observed in the no-chemotherapy group.

The findings underscored that “the adjuvant chemotherapy benefits were only observed among those who were ctDNA-positive,” Magee said.

“ctDNA can guide postsurgical treatment decisions by identifying which patients are most likely to benefit from chemotherapy, and in the surveillance setting, ctDNA can predict recurrence — usually ahead of scans,” she added.

“This opens the opportunity to intervene and give those patients a second chance at cure.”

On the heels of major recent advances including CT, MRI, and PET-CT, “we believe that ctDNA represents the next major pivotal advancement in monitoring and eventually better understanding cancer diagnostics,” Magee said.

Commenting on the study, William M. Grady, MD, medical director of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center Gastrointestinal Cancer Prevention Clinic in Seattle, said the BESPOKE trial represents a “well-done” study, adding to research underscoring that “MRD testing is a more accurate prognostic assay than the current standards of CT scan and CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen, a tumor marker) testing.”

However, “a limitation is that this is 2 years of follow-up, [while] 5-year follow-up data would be ideal,” he told Medscape Medical News, noting, importantly, that “a small number of patients who have no evidence of disease (NED) at 2 years develop recurrence by 5 years.”

Furthermore, more research demonstrating the outcomes of MRD detection is needed, Grady added.

“A caveat is that studies are still needed showing that if you change your care of patients based on the MRD result, that you improve outcomes,” he said. “These studies are being planned and initiated at this time, from my understanding.”

Oncologists treating patients with CRC are commonly performing MRD assessment with ctDNA assays; however, Grady noted that the practice is still not the standard of care.

Regarding the suggestion of ctDNA representing the next major, pivotal step in cancer monitoring, Grady responded that “I think this is aspirational, and further studies are needed to make this claim.”

However, “it does look like it has the promise to turn out to be true.”

Magee is an employee of Natera, Inc. Grady has been on the scientific advisory boards for Guardant Health and Freenome and has consulted for Karius.

Among women aged 70 years or older with screen-detected breast cancer, those with a history of screening mammography within 5 years of their diagnosis were much more likely to be diagnosed at an earlier stage and much less likely to die from breast cancer, according to a new analysis of over 13,000 women.

“Our findings support the potential for routine screening to improve breast cancer outcomes” and “highlight the importance of considering screening history when evaluating the impact of regular mammography among older women,” the study authors wrote.

The study, led by Sida Huang, BS, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, Connecticut, was published online in JAMA Network Open.

The study used a claims-based algorithm to categorize mammograms, which could have led to some misclassification. However, the researchers noted that focusing on women with screen-detected breast cancer should reduce confounding from non–screen-detected cancers. The study did not account for breast density and family history, or other clinical factors, and its findings may be influenced by lead-time bias.

The study received support through grants from the American Cancer Society and was partly funded by the Yale Cancer Center Pilot Award for Research on Cancer Equity. Some authors reported receiving grants or personal fees from various sources.

France's National Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health Safety (ANSES) is warning the public about the risk of confusing colchicum with wild garlic, a mistake that can lead to serious poisoning — and in some cases, death.

Colchicum (Colchicum autumnale) and wild garlic (Allium ursinum) are wild plants that grow in similar woodland environments during spring. While wild garlic is edible, colchicum is highly toxic. Although the flowers of the two plants differ significantly, colchicum blooms only in autumn, meaning the springtime harvest of leaves occurs when neither plant is flowering — making visual distinction difficult.

Less commonly, colchicum may also be mistaken for wild leek (Allium polyanthum).

Between 2020 and 2022, French poison control centres recorded 28 cases of confusion between colchicum and wild garlic or wild leek. The poisonings occurred from March to May, peaking in April. The harvested leaves were typically consumed in pesto or cooked in salads, quiches, or sautéed dishes.

Half of the individuals developed significant or prolonged symptoms such as persistent vomiting or diarrhoea. Four people experienced life-threatening complications, including severe gastrointestinal, liver, and blood disorders. Two deaths were reported.

The severity of the poisoning depends on the quantity of leaves ingested, the variable colchicine concentration in the plant, and potential interactions with commonly used medications, such as macrolide antibiotics or vitamin K antagonists, which can increase toxic risk.

Wild garlic grows to 15-40 cm and has a distinct garlic smell, especially when its leaves are crushed. It produces white star-shaped flowers between April and early June. Its bulb is elongated and white.

Colchicum, by contrast, has purple flowers that only bloom in autumn, and its bulb is round and dark. Its leaves emerge in February to March; are thick, stemless, and rounded at the tip; and appear to grow directly from the ground. All parts of the colchicum plant are toxic.

Wild garlic typically grows in large patches in shaded, damp woodlands, valleys, or along streams. Its leaves are generally shiny, oval, and pointed, each attached to a distinct stem.

To avoid potentially fatal errors, ANSES urges wild garlic foragers to:

If symptoms — particularly digestive issues — occur within hours of eating dishes containing wild garlic or wild leek, or if there is any doubt:

For patients who already have a positive result on a screening test for primary aldosteronism (PA), confirmatory testing with the seated saline suppression test (SSST) adds little to the diagnostic work-up and may delay proper and timely care, according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. 

The SSST may misinform treatment decisions and lead to missed chances for intervention “even in patients who would clearly respond to treatment,” the authors wrote, led by Alexander A. Leung, MD, MPH, Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. 

The research setting was the Endocrine Hypertension Clinic in Calgary, and the study included 156 adults with a positive screening result for PA. The SSST involved administering 2 L of 0.9% sodium chloride intravenously over 4 hours.

“The results of our study suggest that removal of routine confirmatory testing from the diagnostic care pathway for PA may help to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce the time needed for diagnosis and treatment for most patients,” the authors wrote.

PA accounts for 10%-30% of all cases of hypertension worldwide. Diagnosing it is important not just because of the prevalence but because there are highly effective, disease-targeted treatments. But fewer than 1% of patients with PA get treatment because of the lack of awareness and barriers raised by a complex diagnostic pathway.

That's why Leung's team set out to assess in a blinded clinical trial whether confirmatory testing was worth the complications it added to the process.

“We selected the SSST because many believe it to be the most reliable confirmatory test for PA,” the authors wrote. “We used response to targeted treatment as the reference because it is pragmatic and relevant to patients.”

They found that “the SSST could not discriminate between response statuses (area under the curve, 62.1%; 95% CI, 45.1%-79.1%). The positive and negative likelihood ratios were equivocal for aldosterone cutoffs ranging from 140 to 300 pmol/L. These findings remained consistent after differences in treatment, occurrence of hypokalemia, and laboratory assay used were accounted for.”

However, Joshua D. Lenchus, DO, RPh, internal medicine specialist and American Osteopathic Association board member, who was not part of the study, said the study “likely has relatively limited application in the US.”

He explained that some patients with suspected primary PA do not require a confirmatory test, and of those currently available, the SSST is not universally applicable.

“For example, it is generally not used in patients with uncontrolled blood pressure or those with a history of congestive heart failure. Running an intravenous infusion of saline over 4 hours is easier in an inpatient setting but may be cumbersome in an outpatient office,” he told Medscape Medical News.

He said he was also surprised to find that “less than 30% of study participants had resistant hypertension, less than 15% were under the age of 40, and more than 50% were over the age of 60. Typically, the incidence rate of primary aldosteronism is highest in females under 40 years of age with resistant hypertension and hypokalemia.”

Lenchus said the SSST is one of several confirmatory tests for PA used in the United States, including the captopril challenge test and the fludrocortisone suppression test, although no gold standard exists as yet.

He said he would like to see a follow-up with a larger cohort of patients, perhaps comparing several confirmatory tests head-to-head to identify a standard.

The study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Hypertension Canada, and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.

Consuming foods high in carotenoids appeared to be modestly linked to a reduced risk for pediatric hearing loss, according to a poster presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies (PAS) 2025 Meeting.

“Pediatric hearing loss increases with age due to otitis media, trauma, ototoxic medications, and/or noise exposure, impacting behavioral and language development,” Julia M. Morales, medical student at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, and her colleagues reported.

The hypothesis underlying the study focuses on the idea that dietary antioxidants may mitigate damage from oxidative stress from loud noises and other insults that can harm cochlear structures and exacerbate hearing loss. Carotenoids have antioxidant properties, and vitamin A, a carotenoid metabolite, has been shown to reduce the risk for hearing loss from infections in some low-resource settings.

“The findings are intuitively plausible,” Daniel Choo, MD, professor, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, and Akron Children's Hospital, Akron, Ohio, told Medscape Medical News.

“There are significant data demonstrating that oxidative stress can damage or kill cochlear cells and subsequently cause sensorineural hearing loss,” said Choo, who was not involved in the study. “Several lines of research also show that antioxidants can likely protect the cochlea from a variety of insults including noise trauma, chemotherapy-related, and some antibiotic (aminoglycoside)-related hearing loss, so proposing that the antioxidant effects of carotenoids might protect hearing doesn't seem unreasonable.”

The researchers analyzed data from the 2017-2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which provided dietary recalls for assessing carotenoid and vitamin A intake and both self-reported hearing loss and pure-tone audiometry for assessing hearing ability. The researchers calculated the association between carotenoid intake and pure-tone audiometry.

The sample included 2502 youths with an average age of 12 years, including 1048 children aged 6-11 years and 1454 adolescents aged 12-19 years. The incidence of mild speech-frequency hearing loss — loss of the ability to hear sounds within the frequency range of human speech — was 1.6% in the sample. In addition, 3.01% had mild high-frequency hearing loss, and 0.04% had moderate high-frequency hearing loss.

Self-reported hearing quality was rated as being excellent by 64.5% of participants, being good by 31.6%, having “a little trouble” by 3.4%, having moderate trouble by 0.5%, and having a lot of trouble by 0.08%. None reported deafness. A little less than half the participants (45.8%) had a history of at least three ear infections.

The researchers did not identify any associations between carotenoid or provitamin A intake and ear infections. However, children with self-reported hearing loss consumed less beta-cryptoxanthin (P < .001), lutein plus zeaxanthin (P < .001), vitamin A from carotenoids (P = .047), and provitamin A carotenoids (P = .03).

The researchers also identified a link between high-frequency hearing loss and several carotenoids: Greater hearing loss was associated with a lower intake of alpha-carotene (P < .002), beta-carotene (P < .02), provitamin A carotenoids (P < .015), and vitamin A from carotenoids (P < .02). After adjusting for confounders, children consuming the highest quartile of beta-cryptoxanthin and alpha-carotene had about half the odds of high-frequency hearing loss (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.47; P = .04 and aOR, 0.42; P = .01, respectively).

Similarly, a significant inverse association existed between speech-frequency hearing loss and beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein plus zeaxanthin, provitamin A carotenoids, vitamin A from carotenoids, retinol, total vitamin A, and total carotenoids (P < .01 for all). In the adjusted analysis, however, the intake of any carotenoids was not significantly associated with speech-frequency hearing loss.

“Speech-frequency hearing loss is often conductive, from ear infections, while high-frequency [hearing loss] reflects sensorineural damage from noise and oxidative stress,” the authors wrote. “However, the lack of association with ear infection history indicates carotenoids may be more relevant to sensorineural than conductive pathways.”

Overall, the poster findings reinforce one reason that vegetables are a beneficial part of a healthy diet, with carotenoids, in particular, likely providing a protective effect for hearing, among other benefits, Choo said.

“The implications from this research are that children should have the ‘proper' amount of carotenoids in their diet,” he said. “However, this study doesn't really address how much carotenoids a child needs to achieve an otoprotective effect against sensorineural hearing loss. The research also doesn't specify what carotenoids should be ingested, how frequently, or in what format.”

Food sources of carotenoids in NHANES included carrots, sweet potatoes, bell peppers, spinach, kale, and broccoli. “If nothing else, incorporating these vegetables into a child's diet is almost never going to be a bad thing,” Choo said.

Other limitations included the study's reliance on dietary recall and the lack of objective measurements for how much carotenoids the participants consumed, so the study lacks the rigor of a well-controlled study, Choo pointed out.

The research was funded by the US Department of Agriculture. The authors did not report having any disclosures. Choo is a site principal investigator for an otoferlin gene therapy trial funded by Akouos and Eli Lilly and consults for 3NT Medical and Decibel/Regeneron.

An influenza vaccine, either given alone or with a COVID-19 vaccine during the follicular phase, was linked to minor changes in the length of the menstrual cycle of less than 1 day, but the length of the cycle bounced back to normal soon after.

""In this cohort study of individuals with regular menstrual cycles, influenza vaccine given alone or in combination with a COVID-19 vaccine was associated with a small but temporary change in menstrual cycle length. These findings may help clinicians confirm the utility of vaccination for patients with concerns about menstrual adverse effects of vaccination,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Emily R. Boniface, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon. It was published online on April 29, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

The study's high levels of missing demographic data and a mostly young, White, highly educated sample could have limited how widely these results apply. Self-reported vaccine dates could have recall errors. Incomplete cycle data led to exclusions, and unmeasured factors might still influence the findings.

A new resource for seekers of independent vaccine science is in the works. The Vaccine Integrity Project, an initiative launched by the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), seeks to fill gaps left by recent federal changes that are altering the dissemination of scientific information, according to a press release by the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.

The project is funded by an unrestricted gift from a foundation known as Alumbra, established by philanthropist Christy Walton.

The project aligns with the CIDRAP mission to “prevent illness and death from targeted infectious disease threats through research and the translation of scientific evidence into real-world, practical applications, policies, and solutions,” according to the press release. 

At its outset, the Vaccine Integrity Project has established an eight-member steering committee to help guide clinicians in optimizing protection of the public against vaccine-preventable diseases. The committee plans to hold facilitated, information-gathering sessions in coming months to gauge with actions are needed “to ensure the integrity of the US vaccine system, including vaccine evaluations and clinical guidelines,” according to the project website.

The Steering Committee is co-chaired by Margaret Hamburg, MD, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner and co-president of the InterAcademy Partnership, and Harvey Fineberg, MD, current president of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and past president of the US National Academy of Medicine, according to the CIDRAP press release. 

“Access to nonbiased, objective, and accurate information would be very helpful, especially in a time where public health initiatives are at risk,” said Shirin Mazumder, MD, infectious diseases specialist in Memphis, Tennessee, in an interview.

Removal of evidence-based medical information from public sources has the potential to further propagate misinformation and prevent the general public from making decisions regarding their health without all of the necessary facts, Mazumder said. “This has a great potential of harm, especially as it pertains to vaccine-preventable illnesses,” she added.

“As a physician who cares for a large population of patients living with HIV and at risk for HIV, I have concerns regarding how proposed budget cuts to essential programs, such as the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program and Ending the HIV/AIDS Epidemic Initiative, will affect patient care,” Mazumder told Medscape Medical News. “Young people, gay and bisexual men, and minority populations are disproportionately affected by HIV, and the proposed funding cuts will further marginalize this group and prevent the most vulnerable from accessing HIV education, prevention, testing, care, and treatment,” she said.

“The presence of an independent resource with no political affiliations that can serve as an objective guide to gather information from healthcare professionals, healthcare organizations, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and policymakers is critical to ensure that recommendations are comprehensive,” Mazumder told Medscape Medical News regarding the potential effect of the Vaccine Integrity Project.

Ideally, the feedback gathered by these different groups will assist in creating guidelines rooted in evidence-based practice and provide accurate information to help people make the best decisions pertaining to preventative healthcare, she said.

Mazumder had no relevant financial relationships.

An international team of scientists led by the Medical University of Vienna has identified similarities in the mechanisms of diabetes and cancer: as the researchers show, the protein PPARγ, which is central to the regulation of metabolic processes, can also influence the growth of prostate cancer cells. PPARγ is already known to be a target of certain drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes. The results of the study, which have been published in the leading journal Molecular Cancer, indicate that such drugs could also represent a promising approach for the treatment of prostate cancer.

PPARγ has been known in diabetes research for quite some time, as it has an influence on insulin sensitivity. For more than 20 years, the protein has been the target of certain medications, including so-called thiazolidinediones such as pioglitazone, which are used to treat type 2 diabetes. In the search for new, targeted therapeutic approaches for tumors, cancer research has also been looking at this for several years. PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) is a transcription factor that plays an important role in the regulation of metabolic processes, inflammatory reactions and cell growth as a gene activator. As the research team led by Lukas Kenner (Clinical Department of Pathology at MedUni Vienna) has now shown, it is also associated with the growth of prostate cancer.

The researchers came to this conclusion by examining cell cultures and tissue samples from patient cohorts. They analysed how different activation states of the protein affect the cells. ""It was shown that the diabetes drug pioglitazone influences the activity of PPARγ and thus inhibits the growth behaviour and metabolism of tumor cells. Furthermore, initial results revealed that prostate cancer patients with diabetes who were treated with PPARγ agonists had not relapsed at the time of data collection,"" explains first author Emine Atas (MedUni Vienna's Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-guided Therapy). ""This suggests that drugs that target PPARγ could represent a new approach to the treatment of prostate cancer,"" explains principal investigator Lukas Kenner.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide. Despite enormous medical advances in recent years, in Austria alone this type of tumor is still responsible for one in eight cancer deaths in men. The currently available treatment methods range from surgery and radiotherapy to medication. The identification of previously unknown molecular mechanisms could help to develop targeted therapies. PPARγ, as a potential regulator of tumor growth, is a promising option here, which will now be investigated in further studies.

A major population study reveals that diets high in ultra-processed foods are tied to poorer mental health, and uncovers biological markers that help explain the link.

Study: Associations of Ultra-Processed Food Intake and Its Circulating Metabolomic Signature with Mental Disorders in Middle-Aged and Older Adults. Image Credit: Lightspring / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, researchers assessed the associations of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) and related metabolic signatures with mental disorders.

Mental disorders, including conditions like anxiety, substance use disorder (SUD), and depression, are major contributors to global disease and disability burden. Despite therapeutic advances, mental disorder prevalence has remained stagnant in the past decades, highlighting the need for complementary preventive strategies aimed at modifiable risk factors.

Dietary habits play a crucial role in the development and progression of mental disorders. In particular, diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vegetables, and fruits are associated with a reduced risk of mental disorders, whereas Western and pro-inflammatory diets rich in saturated fats and refined carbohydrates elevate the risk. UPFs are mass-produced foods that undergo multiple steps of processing and contain limited whole-food content.

UPF intake has steadily increased, driven by the globalization and urbanization of food systems. Despite substantial evidence implicating UPFs in mental health disturbances, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The poor nutritional profile of UPFs, characterized by minimal dietary fiber, higher calories, and excessive sugars, sodium, and saturated fats, has been linked to a heightened risk of various chronic conditions.

In the present study, researchers examined associations of UPF intake and related metabolic signatures with mental disorders. Data from the United Kingdom Biobank (UKB), a large prospective cohort of over 500,000 participants, were used. The UKB collected extensive information on sociodemographics, biological factors, and lifestyle. Participants were excluded if they lacked metabolomic measurements and dietary data or had prior mental disorder diagnoses.

Dietary intake data were obtained using a self-administered dietary assessment tool. High-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed on plasma samples to quantify circulating metabolic profiles. The primary outcomes were incident overall mental disorders, SUD, depressive disorder, or anxiety disorder. Secondary outcomes included 19 psychological symptoms.

These specific symptoms were unhappiness, meaningless feeling, unhappiness with health, feelings of anxiety, foreboding, excessive worry, irritability, restlessness, trouble relaxing, appetite changes, anhedonia, uncontrolled worry, feelings of depression, fatigue, trouble concentrating, feelings of inadequacy, psychomotor changes, sleeping problems, and suicidal ideation.

Potential confounders were age, sex, body mass index (BMI), index of multiple deprivation (IMD), prevalent diseases, healthy lifestyle factors, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Metabolic features linked to UPF intake were identified using an elastic net regression model. Cox proportional hazards regression models examined the associations of UPF intake and related metabolic signatures with mental disorders.

The basic model was adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and IMD. The multivariable model was additionally adjusted for lifestyle factors, prevalent diseases, and WHR. The mutually adjusted model included both UPF intake and its related metabolic signature to analyze the independence of their associations with mental health outcomes. Further, logistic regression models were used to examine associations with specific psychological symptoms.

(A) Study flowchart detailing participant selection, exclusion criteria, and final cohort. (B) Definition of ultra-processed food (UPF) intake and the composition of constructed metabolic signature. (C) Cox proportional hazards regression models were employed to evaluate associations of UPF intake and its metabolic signature with the incident risks of overall mental disorder, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and substance use disorder, with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) estimated. Logistic regression models were employed to evaluate associations of UPF intake and its metabolic signature with the risks of specific psychological symptoms, with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs estimated. Subgroup analyses were conducted stratified by age and sex. (D) Mediation analyses were applied to investigate the mediating effect of UPF-related metabolic signature. SUD indicates substance use disorder.

The study included 30,059 participants aged 56.5 years, on average. Overall, 7,594 individuals developed mental disorders over a median follow-up of 12.6 years. Of these, 892, 865, and 1,300 subjects developed anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, and SUD, respectively. Subjects with higher UPF intake were likely to be younger and have higher body BMI, WHR, higher levels of deprivation (lower socioeconomic status based on IMD scores), and unhealthy lifestyles.

Elastic net regression identified 91 metabolites associated with UPF consumption, which spanned various biochemical categories including fatty acids, lipoproteins (like HDL cholesterol ratios), glucose-related metabolites, and amino acids (like valine). Participants with high UPF intake had higher risks of overall mental disorders, anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, and SUD than those with low UPF intake. Similarly, a higher UPF-linked metabolic signature was associated with higher risks of all four mental health outcomes. Subgroup analyses suggested these associations could be stronger in certain groups; for instance, the link between the metabolic signature and SUD was more evident in females, and associations for UPF intake with SUD, and the metabolic signature with depression and anxiety, were stronger in those under 60 years old.

A mediation analysis showed that the UPF-linked metabolic signature partially mediated the associations between UPF consumption and mental disorder risks. Furthermore, higher intake of UPFs was associated with elevated risks of various mental health symptoms, including suicidal ideation, feelings of anxiety, and unhappiness with health. Conversely, the UPF-linked metabolic signature showed no significant associations with mental health symptoms in the overall population, although subgroup analyses revealed associations between the signature and symptoms like unhappiness with health and depressive feelings, specifically in individuals under 60 years old.

Associations of ultra-processed food intake and its metabolic signature with symptoms of mental health and stratified by age. The symptoms included three categories, namely subjective well-being (3 items), PHQ-9 (9 items), and GAD-7 (7 items). Logistic regression models were employed to evaluate associations of ultra-processed food (UPF) intake and its metabolic signature with the risks of specific psychological symptoms. (A) For UPF intake. (B) For metabolic signature. The results were presented with odds ratios (ORs) per 10% increment for UPF intake and ORs per SD increment for metabolic signature. Colors depict significance levels after false discovery rate correction (significant-blue and not significant-gray).

In sum, UPF intake was significantly associated with higher risks of overall mental disorders, anxiety disorder, SUD, and depressive disorder. The UPF-related metabolic signature was also independently associated with increased risks of these mental disorders; it also partially mediated the association between UPF consumption and psychiatric outcomes. The researchers noted limitations, including the study population being predominantly White UK residents, the reliance on self-reported data, the cross-sectional nature of metabolite measurement, and potential residual confounding, which means findings should be interpreted with caution. Thus, the findings suggest that improving diet quality and reducing UPF consumption may help maintain mental well-being.

Modified antibiotics beat a stubborn lung pathogen and dodge metabolic landmines, offering new hope for patients with HIV, cystic fibrosis, and TB co-infections.

Study: Next-generation rifamycins for the treatment of mycobacterial infections. Image Credit: Kateryna Kon / Shutterstock

The rise of drug-resistant bacteria is a major health crisis. Moreover, the development of antibiotic resistance in pulmonary pathogens such as Mycobacterium abscessus, against which treatment options are already limited, poses a serious problem for cystic fibrosis patients and immunocompromised individuals.

A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences explored new versions of rifamycins, antibiotics traditionally used to treat tuberculosis, to combat severe lung infections caused by M. abscessus. The researchers also explored modifications to the drug that could boost its strength and reduce harmful interactions with other medications.

Rifamycins are essential antibiotics, widely used to treat tuberculosis. These drugs effectively target and eliminate various mycobacterial populations. However, their effectiveness is limited against lung infections caused by M. abscessus, a non-tuberculous Mycobacterium, as the bacterium has intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics.

Mycobacterium abscessus develops resistance through mechanisms that include drug inactivation. Rifamycins also carry the risk of negative interactions with other drugs by affecting liver enzymes. This is particularly problematic for patients with conditions like cystic fibrosis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), who require multiple medications. These concerns highlight the urgent need for new rifamycins that are more potent against M. abscessus and have fewer drug interactions.

In the present study, the researchers from the United States and Germany systematically identified and evaluated new rifamycin compounds through a multi-stage process. They began by synthesizing various analogs of the rifamycin antibiotic rifabutin and screening them for their ability to inhibit the growth of both wild-type M. abscessus and a mutant strain lacking the enzyme adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyltransferase (Arr), which confers resistance to rifamycins.

This initial screen aimed to select compounds that could overcome the bacterium's intrinsic resistance mechanism. Compounds demonstrating favorable potency progressed to the next stage, where their plasma protein binding was assessed in human and mouse plasma.

The researchers then used mouse models to examine the compounds' pharmacokinetics, which is how the drugs move through the body, and their uptake by macrophages, a type of immune cell that engulfs bacteria in lung lesions. This helped predict how well the drugs would reach their target within infected tissues. Compounds with promising pharmacokinetic properties, comparable to or better than rifabutin, were chosen for further evaluation.

The selected compounds underwent additional biological profiling to thoroughly assess their effectiveness against M. abscessus. This included evaluating their bactericidal activity against different forms of the bacteria, such as extracellular (outside cells), intracellular (inside cells), replicating, and nonreplicating. The activity against nonreplicating bacteria is particularly important because these bacteria can survive in a dormant state and are often resistant to antibiotics.

Furthermore, the potential for drug-drug interactions was investigated by measuring the induction of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme in human hepatocytes. This enzyme is involved in metabolizing many drugs, and its induction can lead to reduced effectiveness or increased toxicity of other medications. Finally, the compounds' cytotoxicity, or their ability to harm human cells, was assessed to determine their safety profile.

The study found that several new rifamycin analogs, particularly the lead candidates UMN-120 and UMN-121, which belong to a C25-substituted carbamate series, exhibited significantly improved potency against M. abscessus compared to the current drug, rifabutin. This enhanced activity was attributed to the strategic modification of these analogs to overcome the bacterium's intrinsic resistance mechanisms, specifically ADP-ribosylation.

The new compounds demonstrated potent bactericidal activity against both replicating and nonreplicating M. abscessus, including intracellular bacteria residing within macrophages. This was particularly noteworthy since nonreplicating, drug-tolerant bacteria often contribute to the persistence of infection.

A key finding of the study was the reduced potential for drug-drug interactions with the new rifamycin analogs. Rifamycins, including rifabutin, can induce the CYP3A4 enzyme, which plays a critical role in metabolizing various drugs. Induction of CYP3A4 can lead to decreased effectiveness or increased toxicity of other medications. The researchers found that several of the new analogs, including the lead candidates, exhibited significantly lower CYP3A4 induction compared to rifabutin, suggesting a reduced risk of such interactions. Crucially, these compounds retained high potency against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the cause of TB, meaning they could potentially treat TB without the drug interaction liability common to existing rifamycins, offering a significant advantage for patients co-infected with HIV.

Furthermore, in mouse models of M. abscessus lung infection, the lead compounds UMN-120 and UMN-121 demonstrated remarkable efficacy. When administered as single agents, they were shown to be at least as effective in reducing bacterial load in the lungs as a standard-of-care combination therapy involving four different drugs.

The study also assessed the new compounds' metabolic stability and cytotoxicity. Results indicated that the new rifamycins were generally less metabolically labile than rifabutin and demonstrated favorable cytotoxicity profiles in cell culture assays.

The authors acknowledged that the study had some limitations. The compounds' pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were primarily evaluated in murine models of acute lung infection. While these results are promising, further research is needed to confirm their applicability to humans. Additionally, the study did not assess activity against M. abscessus in biofilm-like structures or chronic infection models, which are relevant to persistent human disease and represent areas for future investigation.

In summary, the research successfully identified new rifamycin analogs, specifically the preclinical development candidates UMN-120 and UMN-121, with enhanced activity against M. abscessus and reduced potential for drug-drug interactions. These findings offer a promising avenue for developing improved treatments for M. abscessus lung infections and potentially safer, more effective regimens for Tuberculosis, supporting their advancement towards clinical evaluation and bringing hope to patients with comorbidities such as HIV and cystic fibrosis.

Hand hygiene is one of the most effective, affordable and universal tools we have to prevent the transmission of infections and provide high-quality, clean and safe medical care.

While medical gloves serve a vital role in preventing transmission of infection, for example when there is risk of exposure to blood and body fluids, they are not a substitute for cleaning hands at the right time. On this World Hand Hygiene Day, the World Health Organization (WHO) urges governments, health-care facilities, and frontline workers around the world to reinforce hand hygiene practices – a proven, cost-effective intervention to protect both patients and health-care workers.

Medical gloves can reduce the risk of infection, but they are never a replacement for hand hygiene. On this World Hand Hygiene Day, let us double down on our commitment and action to improve hand hygiene in health care settings to ensure the safety of patients and health-care workers.""

Dr. Bruce Aylward, WHO Assistant Director-General, Universal Health Coverage, Life Course

Gloves can become contaminated just like hands and are often misused, such as being worn indefinitely while health workers switch between patients or when they are performing multiple procedures for the same patient. Additionally, overuse of gloves contributes to environmental degradation.

An average university hospital in a developed country generates 1634 tons of health-care waste each year, which is equivalent to over 360 African elephants. Much of the waste could have been avoided if gloves were used properly and good hand hygiene was practiced. Most used gloves are considered infectious and require high-temperature incineration or specialized treatment, adding strain to already burdened waste management systems.

WHO urges national policymakers and health community take the following actions to improve rational use of gloves and hand hygiene in healthcare settings:

On World Hand Hygiene Day, 5 May, WHO delivers a powerful message: ""It might be gloves. It is always hand hygiene.""

Storm clouds hung low above a community center in Jackson, where pastor Andre Devine invited people inside for lunch. Hoagies with smoked turkey and ham drew the crowd, but several people lingered for free preventive health care: tests for HIV and other diseases, flu shots, and blood pressure and glucose monitoring.

Between greetings, Devine, executive director of the nonprofit group Hearts for the Homeless, commiserated with his colleagues about the hundreds of thousands of dollars their groups had lost within a couple of weeks, swept up in the Trump administration's termination of research dollars and clawback of more than $11 billion from health departments across the country.

Devine would have to scale back food distribution for people in need. And his colleagues at the nonprofit health care group My Brother's Keeper were worried they'd have to shutter the group's mobile clinic — an RV offering HIV tests, parked beside the community center that morning. Several employees had already been furloughed and the cuts kept coming, said June Gipson, CEO of My Brother's Keeper.

""People can't work without being paid,"" she said.

The directors of other community-based groups in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Tennessee told KFF Health News they too had reduced their spending on HIV testing and outreach because of delayed or slashed federal funds — or they were making plans to do so, anticipating cuts to come.

Scaling back these efforts could prove tragic, Gipson said. Without an extra boost of support to get tested or stay on treatment, many people living with HIV will grow sicker and stand a greater chance of infecting others.

President Donald Trump, in his first term, promised to end America's HIV epidemic — and he put the resources of the federal government behind the effort. This time, he has deployed the powers of his office to gut funding, abandoning those communities at highest risk of HIV.

Trump's earlier efforts targeted seven Southern states, including Mississippi, where funds went to community groups and health departments that tailor interventions to historically underserved communities that face discrimination and have less access to quality education, health care, stable income, and generational wealth. Such factors help explain why Black people accounted for 38% of HIV diagnoses in the United States in 2023, despite representing only 14% of the population, and also why half of the country's new HIV infections occur in the South.

Now, Trump is undermining HIV efforts by barring funds from programs built around diversity, equity, and inclusion. A Day One executive order said they represent ""immense public waste and shameful discrimination.""

Since then, his administration has cut millions of dollars in federal grants to health departments, universities, and nonprofit organizations that do HIV work. And in April, it eliminated half of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 10 HIV branch offices, according to an email to grant recipients, reviewed by KFF Health News, from the director of the CDC's Division of HIV Prevention. The layoffs included staff who had overseen the rollout of HIV grants to health departments and community-based groups, like My Brother's Keeper.

The CDC provides more than 90% of all federal funding for HIV prevention — about $1 billion annually. The Trump administration's May 2 budget proposal for fiscal 2026 takes aim at DEI initiatives, including in its explanation for cutting $3.59 billion from the CDC. Although the proposal doesn't mention HIV prevention specifically, the administration's drafted plan for HHS, released mid-April, eliminates all prevention funding at the CDC, as well as funding for Trump's initiative to end the epidemic.

Eliminating federal funds for HIV prevention would lead to more than 143,000 additional people in the U.S. becoming infected with HIV within five years, and about 127,000 additional people who die of AIDS-related causes, according to estimates from the Foundation for AIDS Research, a nonprofit known as amfAR. Excess medical costs would exceed $60 billion, it said.

Eldridge Dwayne Ellis, the coordinator of the mobile testing clinic at My Brother's Keeper, said curbing the group's services goes beyond HIV.

""People see us as their only outlet, not just for testing but for confidential conversations, for a shoulder to cry on,"" he said. ""I don't understand how someone, with the stroke of a pen, could just haphazardly write off the health of millions.""

Ellis came into his role in the mobile clinic haphazardly, when he worked as a construction worker. Suddenly dizzy and unwell on a job, a co-worker suggested he visit the organization's brick-and-mortar clinic nearby. He later applied for a position with My Brother's Keeper, inspired by its efforts to give people support to help themselves.

For example, Ellis described a young man who visited the mobile clinic recently who had been kicked out of his home and was sleeping on couches or on the street. Ellis thought of friends he'd known in similar situations that put them at risk of HIV by increasing the likelihood of transactional sex or substance use disorders.

When a rapid test revealed HIV, the young man fell silent. ""The quiet tears hurt worse — it's the dread of mortality,"" Ellis said. ""I tried to be as strong as possible to let him know his life is not over, that this wasn't a death sentence.""

Ellis and his team enrolled the man into HIV care that day and stayed in touch. Otherwise, Ellis said, he might not have had the means or fortitude to seek treatment on his own and adhere to daily HIV pills. Not only is that deadly for people with HIV, it's bad for public health. HIV experts use the phrase ""treatment as prevention"" because most new infections derive from people who aren't adhering to treatment well enough to be considered virally suppressed — which keeps the disease from spreading.

Only a third of people living with HIV in Mississippi were virally suppressed in 2022. Nationally, that number is about 65%. That's worse than in eastern and southern Africa, where 78% of people with HIV aren't spreading the virus because they're on steady treatment.

My Brother's Keeper is one of many groups improving such numbers by helping people get tested and stay on medication. But the funding cuts in Washington have curtailed their work. The first loss was a $12 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, not even two years into a 10-year project. ""Programs based primarily on artificial and non-scientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry,"" the NIH said in a letter reviewed by KFF Health News.

My Brother's Keeper then lost a CDC award to reduce health disparities — a grant channeled through the Mississippi state health department — that began with the group's work during the covid pandemic but had broadened to screening and care for HIV, heart disease, and diabetes. These are some of the maladies that account for why low-income Black people in the Deep South die sooner, on average, than those who are white. According to a recent study, the former's life expectancy was just 68 years in 2021, on par with the average in impoverished nations like Rwanda and Myanmar.



The group then lost CDC funding that covered the cost of laboratory work to detect HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis in patients' blood samples. Mississippi has the highest rate of sexually transmitted diseases among states, in part because people spread infections when they aren't tested and treated.

""The labs are $200 to $600 per person,"" Gipson said, ""so now we can't do that without passing the cost to the patient, and some can't pay.""

Two other CDC grants on HIV prevention, together worth $841,000, were unusually delayed.

Public health specialists close to the CDC, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they fear retaliation, said they were aware of delays in HIV prevention funding, despite court orders to unfreeze payments for federal grants in January and February. ""The faucet was being turned off at a higher level than at the CDC,"" one specialist said. The delays have now been compounded, they said, by the gutting of that agency's HIV workforce in April.

""I know of many organizations reliant on subcontracted federal funds who have not been paid for the work they've done, or whose funding has been terminated,"" said Dafina Ward, executive director of the Southern AIDS Coalition.

To reach the underserved, these groups offer food, housing assistance, bus passes, disease screening, and a sense of community. A network of the groups was fostered, in part, by Trump's initiative to end the epidemic. And it showed promise: From 2017 to 2022, new HIV infections decreased by 21% in the cities and the Southern states it targeted.

Disparities in infections were still massive, with the rate of HIV diagnoses about eight times as high for Black people as white people, and the South remained hardest hit. Ward was hopeful at the start of this year, however, as testing became more widespread and HIV prevention drugs — called preexposure prophylaxis, or PrEP — slowly gained popularity. But her outlook has shifted and she fears that grassroots organizations might not weather the funding turmoil.

""We're seeing an about-face of what it means to truly work towards ending HIV in this country,"" she said.

Southeast of Jackson, in Hattiesburg, Sean Fortenberry tears up as he walks into a small room used until recently for HIV testing. He has kept his job at Mississippi's AIDS Services Coalition by shifting his role but agonizes about the outcome. When Fortenberry tested positive for HIV in 2007, he said, his family and doctor saved his life.

""I never felt that I was alone, and that was really, really important,"" he said. ""Other people don't have that, so when I came across this position, I was gung-ho. I wanted to help.""

But the coalition froze its HIV testing clinic and paused mobile testing at homeless shelters, colleges, and churches late last year. Kathy Garner, the group's executive director, said the Mississippi health department — which funds the coalition with CDC's HIV prevention dollars — told her to pause outreach in October before the state renewed the group's annual HIV prevention contract.

Kendra Johnson, communicable diseases director at Mississippi's health department, said that delays in HIV prevention funds were initially on the department's end because it was short on administrative staff. Then Trump took office. ""We were working with our federal partners to ensure that our new objectives were in line with new HIV prevention activities,"" Johnson said. ""And we ran into additional delays due to paused communications at the federal level.""

The AIDS coalition remains afloat largely because of federal money from the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program for treatment and from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. ""If most of these federal dollars are cut, we would have to close,"" Garner said.

The group provides housing or housing assistance to roughly 400 people each year. Research shows that people in stable housing adhere much better to HIV treatment and are far less likely to die than unhoused people with HIV.

Funding cuts have shaken every state, but the South is acutely vulnerable when it comes to HIV, said Gregorio Millett, director of public policy at amfAR. Southern states have the highest level of poverty and a severe shortage of rural clinics, and several haven't expanded Medicaid so that more low-income adults have health insurance.

Further, Southern states aren't poised to make up the difference. Alabama, Louisiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Missouri put zero state funds into HIV prevention last year, according to NASTAD, an association of public health officials who administer HIV and hepatitis programs. In contrast, about 40% of Michigan's HIV prevention budget is provided by the state, 50% of Colorado's HIV prevention budget, and 88% of New York's.

""When you are in the South, you need the federal government,"" said Gipson, from My Brother's Keeper. ""When we had slavery, we needed the federal government. When we had the push for civil rights, we needed the federal government. And we still need the federal government for health care,"" she said. ""The red states are going to suffer, and we're going to start suffering sooner than anyone else.""

When asked about cuts and delays to HIV prevention funding, the CDC directed queries to HHS. The department's director of communications, Andrew Nixon, replied in an email: ""Critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue under the Administration for a Healthy America (AHA) as a part of Secretary [Robert F.] Kennedy's vision to streamline HHS to better serve the American people.""

Nixon did not reply to a follow-up question on whether the Trump administration considers HIV prevention critical.

On April 4, Gipson received a fraction of her delayed HIV prevention funds from the CDC. But Gipson said she was afraid to hire back staff amid the turmoil.

Like the directors of many other community organizations, Gipson is going after grants from foundations and companies. Pharmaceutical firms such as Gilead and GSK that produce HIV drugs are among the largest contributors of non-governmental funds for HIV testing, prevention, and care, but private funding for HIV has never come close to the roughly $40 billion that the federal government allocated to HIV annually.

""If the federal government withdraws some or all of its support, the whole thing will collapse,"" said Alice Riener, CEO of the community-based organization CrescentCare in Louisiana. ""What you see in Mississippi is the beginning of that, and what's so concerning is the infrastructure we've built will collapse quickly but take decades to rebuild.""

Southern health officials are reeling from cuts because state budgets are already tight. Mississippi's state health officer, Daniel Edney, spoke with KFF Health News on the day the Trump administration terminated $11 billion in covid-era funds intended to help states improve their public health operations. ""There's not a lot of fat, and we're cutting it to the bone right now,"" Edney said.

Mississippi needed this boost, Edney said, because the state ranks among the lowest in health metrics including premature death, access to clinical care, and teen births. But Edney noted hopeful trends: The state had recently moved from 50th to 49th worst in health rankings, and its rate of new HIV cases was dropping.

""The science tells us what we need to do to identify and care for patients, and we're improving,"" he said. ""But trends can change very quickly on us, so we can't take our foot off the gas pedal.""

If that happens, researchers say, the comeback of HIV will go unnoticed at first, as people at the margins of society are infected silently before they're hospitalized. As untreated infections spread, the rise will eventually grow large enough to make a dent in national statistics, a resurgence that will cost lives and take years, if not decades, to reverse.

Outside the community center on that stormy March morning, pastor Devine lamented not just the loss of his grant from the health department, but a $1 billion cut to food distribution programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He rattled off consequences he feared: People relying on food assistance would be forced to decide between buying groceries, paying bills, or seeing a doctor, driving them further into poverty, into emergency rooms, into crime.

Deja Abdul-Haqq, a program director at My Brother's Keeper, nodded along as he spoke. ""So goes Mississippi, so goes the rest of the United States,"" Abdul-Haqq said. ""Struggles may start here, but they spread.""

People who are given a vaccine for shingles have a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease, according to a study of more than a million people published in the European Heart Journal today (Tuesday).

The protective effect of the vaccine lasts for up to eight years and is particularly pronounced for men, people under the age of 60 and those with unhealthy lifestyles, such as smoking, drinking alcohol and being inactive.

The study was led by Professor Dong Keon Yon from the Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.

Shingles causes a painful rash and can lead to serious complications, especially in older adults and those with weak immune systems. Previous research shows that, without vaccination, about 30% of people may develop shingles in their lifetime.

In addition to the rash, shingles has been linked to a higher risk of heart problems, so we wanted to find out if getting vaccinated could lower this risk.""

Professor Dong Keon Yon, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea

The study included 1,271,922 people aged 50 or older living in South Korea. Researchers gathered data, from 2012 onwards, on whether people received a shingle vaccine and combined this with data on their cardiovascular health and data on other factors that can influence health, such as age, sex, wealth and lifestyle.

The vaccine was a live zoster vaccine, meaning it contained a weakened form of the varicella zoster virus that causes shingles. In many countries, this type of vaccine is now being replaced with a non-live, recombinant vaccine, meaning it contains a protein from the varicella zoster virus.

The study showed that among people who received the vaccine, there was a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular events overall, with a 26% lower risk of major cardiovascular events (a stroke, heart attack or death from heart disease), a 26% lower risk of heart failure and a 22% lower risk of coronary heart disease.

The protective effect was strongest in the two to three years after the shingles vaccine was given, but researchers found that the protection lasted for up to eight years.

Professor Yon said: ""Our study suggests that the shingles vaccine may help lower the risk of heart disease, even in people without known risk factors. This means that vaccination could offer health benefits beyond preventing shingles.

""There are several reasons why the shingles vaccine may help reduce heart disease. A shingles infection can cause blood vessel damage, inflammation and clot formation that can lead to heart disease. By preventing shingles, vaccination may lower these risks. Our study found stronger benefits in younger people, probably due to a better immune response, and in men, possibly due to differences in vaccine effectiveness.

""This is one of the largest and most comprehensive studies following a healthy general population over a period of up to 12 years. For the first time, this has allowed us to examine the association between shingles vaccination and 18 different types of cardiovascular disease. We were able to account for various other health conditions, lifestyle factors and socioeconomic status, making our findings more robust.

""However, as this study is based on an Asian cohort, the results may not apply to all populations. Since the live zoster vaccine is not suitable for everyone, more research on the recombinant vaccine is needed. While we conducted rigorous analysis, this study does not establish a direct causal relationship, so potential bias from other underlying factors should be considered.""

Professor Yon and his colleagues also plan to study the impact of the recombinant vaccine to see if it has similar benefits for reducing heart disease.

Growing up poor may leave a lasting biological imprint, increasing the odds of frailty decades later—evidence from nearly 80,000 adults across 29 countries underscores the lifelong toll of early deprivation.

Study: Growing up in poverty, growing old in frailty: the life course shaping of health in the United States, England and Europe—a prospective and retrospective study. Image Credit: jrmiller482 / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the journal Scientific Reports, Gindo Tampubolon, a researcher at the University of Manchester, UK, investigated whether people who experienced poverty during their childhood are more likely to develop signs of frailty in their old age.

The analysis's findings indicated that childhood poverty was significantly associated with an increased probability of frailty during later life, with women overall showing higher probabilities of frailty. Other contributing factors to frailty, including childhood illness, wealth, and education, highlighted the long-term effects of deprivation during early life on health.

Childhood poverty is known to increase the risk of health problems in later life, such as disability, poor mental and cognitive function, and physical decline. Previous research has found that adults who grew up poor tend to have worse muscle strength, mood, and memory in old age across 29 high-income countries..

Researchers consider these findings to be evidence for the concept of the “long arm of childhood conditions,” which suggests that early life adversity can have lasting effects throughout life.

However, less is known about whether it also contributes to frailty, an age-related condition involving declines across multiple organ systems and leading to worse clinical outcomes and higher healthcare costs.

In this study, the author tested whether childhood poverty predicts frailty in older adults, even after considering factors from later life such as education, marital status, and adult health.

Using data from three large-scale aging studies representing nearly 80,000 older adults from the United States, England, and Europe, the study investigated whether poor material conditions in childhood still impact frailty in people aged 50 and above. The research also considers the role of social determinants of health across the life course and examines whether the effects differ by sex or country.

The study used the frailty phenotype approach developed by Fried and colleagues. This approach defines frailty as meeting at least three out of five indicators: exhaustion, unintended weight loss, weakness, low energy, and slowness. To ensure comparability, this binary outcome (frail vs. non-frail) was consistently applied across the three datasets though slowness was measured via walking speed tests in the U.S. and England but self-reported mobility issues in Europe.

Childhood poverty was assessed using retrospective self-reports from participants aged 50–95 (average age 66). Due to the possibility of recall errors, especially in older participants, the study employed a latent class approach to reduce recall bias and measurement error, constructing a more reliable measure of childhood poverty.

Data from the British and European surveys included indicators like the number of rooms, access to indoor plumbing, and heating. The American survey used more financially oriented indicators, such as moving due to financial hardship. Despite differences across regions, these variables were harmonized using established methods from earlier studies.

A fixed effects probit model including country fixed effects to account for differences in healthcare systems was used to estimate the association between childhood poverty and frailty, adjusting for confounding variables across the life course (e.g., parental occupation, youth illness, current age, sex, education, wealth, and marital status).

The study analyzed data from the United States, England, and 27 European countries, focusing on those who completed retrospective interviews. The analytic sample comprised 57% females, the mean age was 66.3 years, and 25.6% in Europe, 6% in the U.S., and 18.6% in England had experienced childhood poverty.

A fixed effects probit model revealed that childhood poverty significantly increased the likelihood of frailty in old age. Women were more likely to be frail overall, while higher education and wealth were protective factors. Illness in youth and having a father in a manual occupation were also associated with increased frailty.

Country-specific plots (including the U.S. and England) showed that childhood poverty consistently elevated frailty risk between ages 70 and 90, with significant regional differences across Europe and an overall frailty prevalence of 1.7% in the U.S., 4.3% in England, and 13.4% in Europe. Sensitivity analyses using random effects and sex-stratified models confirmed the robustness of these findings.

Overall, childhood poverty emerged as a strong, persistent determinant of frailty in later life across diverse health systems in high-income countries.

Probabilities of Frail among the childhood poor (dash) and non-poor (solid) in older people aged 70–90 years in U.S., England and Europe based on models in Table 3 where all covariates are set at the sample averages. Analysis of HRS, ELSA and SHARE.

This study offers the first comprehensive cross-national evidence from 29 high-income countries linking childhood poverty to frailty in old age. Despite differences in health systems and welfare support, the association holds across nations.

These findings suggest that childhood poverty may cause long-term biological effects, possibly through epigenetic changes (including accelerated epigenetic aging observed in prior U.S. research) as a hypothesized mechanism, predisposing individuals to frailty. While some earlier studies showed weaker associations, variations in methodology and social systems (e.g., Sweden's welfare model) may explain differences.

The study's strengths include its broad international scope and use of latent constructs to reduce error in retrospective data. However, its observational nature limits causal inference, and survivor and selection biases remain concerns.

Future research should explore low- and middle-income countries where childhood poverty is more prevalent, aligning with the goals of the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing. Addressing childhood poverty is essential to improving health outcomes across the life course.

Scientists harnessed AI to create mutation-resistant antibodies that outperformed conventional drug design, offering a powerful new tool against fast-evolving viruses like SARS-CoV-2.

In a recent study in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers tested and leveraged several cutting-edge technologies, including machine learning, protein structural modeling, natural language processing, and protein sequence language modeling, to computationally design antibodies capable of neutralizing more than 1,300 SARS-CoV-2 strains (including mutants). The design encompassed 64 key mutations in the spike protein's receptor binding domain (RBD), focusing on this critical region for viral entry. The antibody templates used were CR3022, Casirivimab (Regen 10,933), and Imdevimab (Regen 10,987), which are well-known monoclonal antibodies against coronaviruses.

Study findings demonstrated strong reactivity between the novel antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 strains, including Delta (10 antibodies) and Omicron (1 antibody). Notably, 14% of the first batch of antibodies and 40% of the second batch demonstrated “triple cross-binding,” meaning they bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of wild-type, Delta, and Omicron strains in ELISA assays. Notably, the present approach was shown to be much more time and cost-effective than traditional structure-based approaches. It may revolutionize future drug design and development, particularly for fast-evolving pathogens that require frequent modifications to account for their rapid mutation rates. However, while the study showed adaptability by reacting to the emergence of Omicron with a second round of antibody design, its predictive capability for completely new and unknown future variants is still speculative and was not directly demonstrated.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that caused the COVID-19 pandemic remains one of the worst in human history, claiming more than 7 million lives since its discovery in late 2019. Thankfully, government-enforced social distancing measures, in combination with widespread anti-COVID-19 immunization interventions, substantially curbed disease spread.

Unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly evolving family of viruses, and novel strains resistant to previously approved antibody therapeutics have now emerged. A classic example of this is the resistance demonstrated by strains B.1.427 and B.1.429 to bamlanivimab and etesevimab due to their L452R substitutions.

While ongoing research races to keep up with the origins of novel, increasingly resistant SARS-CoV-2 strains, traditional antibody discovery approaches are labor-intensive, inefficient, and expensive. Leveraging recent computational and technological advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and language-based networks (natural language processing architectures), may allow researchers to design and screen antibodies faster and more efficiently than ever before.

The present study aims to assess the viability of AI-based approaches to modeling antibody-antigen binding and screening for antibodies with broad-spectrum neutralizing capabilities. It demonstrates the application of AI models in rapidly discovering therapeutics to counter future pandemics and highlights their potential across medical fields.

“Our study describes using a deep learning model to computationally design effective and broad-spectrum mutations against various strains of the virus' spike protein, and subsequent wet-lab experimentation confirms the findings.”

The study developed several in-house ‘antibody affinity maturation AI models'. These models were based on both GNN and language-based network architectures. The GNN architecture specifically enabled modeling of the relationships between amino acid residues as a graph, capturing both local and global sequence features relevant to antibody-antigen binding. All models were trained using datasets obtained from four curated datasets: 1. SKEMPI database, 2. Observed Antibody Space, 3. Antibody-Bind (AB-Bind) database, and 4. UniProt.

Following training, model accuracy and performance were evaluated using a combined dataset synthesized from SKEMPI and AB-Bind databases. Accuracy and scalability were assessed using a ‘leave-5-out' (L5O) approach.

COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies were identified by first collating GISAID Database data (1300 SARS-CoV-2 strains), selecting templates for in silico cross-binding antibody assays, and generating in silico mutant libraries (mutations in the template). Machine learning models were then used to discover antibodies with broad-spectrum binding to several of the 1,300 supplied SARS-CoV-2 strains. Since the S1 protein is essential for antigen-antibody binding, antibodies that were resistant to mutations in viral S1 proteins (low-to-no reduced binding efficacy) were identified.

Wet lab assays (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays [ELISAs] and coronavirus cytotoxicity assays) were subsequently carried out to validate computational findings experimentally. After the emergence of Omicron, the researchers performed a second round of computational antibody design to further improve antibody affinity specifically against Omicron, demonstrating the reactive adaptability of their approach to newly arising variants.

SARS-CoV-2 cross-binding sequence selection and virus mutation data curation. Step 2: AI-based antibody binding prediction and cross-variants binding selection for potential candidate sequences for future variants. Step 3: Measurement of antibody's binding ability using an ELISA-based assay; and measurement of antibody's neutralizing capacity using neutralization and cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assays.

Evaluations of model accuracy (conducted using Spearman ranking coefficients) revealed that the graph-based model outperforms language-based approaches. Notably, both graph- and language-based models equaled or outperformed the current commercial (non-machine learning) structure-based approach – Discovery Studio.

“Unlike Discovery Studio, which employs a physical model derived from primary, secondary, and tertiary protein structure to compute binding affinity, our model learns the mapping between antibody sequence and binding affinity from a large amount of experimental data.”

The benefits of neural network results extended further, with the graph-based model (Pearson = 0.6) observed to outperform most conventional in silico approaches (Discovery Studio Pearson = 0.45).

Wet lab experiments confirmed these findings. The AI-designed antibody sequences with the highest predicted binding abilities were synthesized. Encouragingly, most of these antibodies were observed to bind and often reach an oversaturated state at higher concentrations to B.1, Delta, and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 strains.

Coronavirus cytopathic assays revealed 10 antibodies capable of neutralizing Vero E6 host cells infected with Delta strains and one antibody capable of neutralizing cells infected with Omicron strains. However, the study also found that strong binding in ELISA assays did not always correspond to neutralizing ability in cell-based assays, indicating that binding affinity alone does not guarantee neutralization. This discrepancy may be due to differences in the spike protein's structure when plate-bound (ELISA) versus on live virus, as well as the specific epitope location and antibody conformation.

It is important to note that, while these results are promising, the study was limited to in vitro (laboratory) experiments. No in vivo (animal or human) efficacy studies were performed, and further research, such as epitope mapping and conformation dynamics studies, will be necessary for more precise antibody design and validation.

Additionally, while the study focused on achieving broad neutralization, the authors acknowledge that there may be a trade-off between broad cross-reactivity and therapeutic specificity, which could limit utility in some clinical contexts.

The present study highlights the benefits of leveraging AI-based structure-free deep neural networks for discovering and screening therapeutic antibodies. These computational models significantly outperformed traditional non-machine learning structure-based platforms in cost, efficiency, and accuracy. AI models have the added benefit of iteratively improving initially discovered antibodies to compensate for mutations in rapidly evolving pathogens.

“Because our approach combines flexibility and high-throughput at a low computational cost, it can be beneficial in other applications of the technology as well.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Cannabis use during pregnancy linked to higher risk of infant complications","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250505/Cannabis-use-during-pregnancy-linked-to-higher-risk-of-infant-complications.aspx","Tue, 06 May 2025 02:50:00 GMT","

An updated systematic review finds that consuming cannabis while pregnant appears to increase the odds of preterm birth, low birth weight and infant death.

The study by researchers at Oregon Health & Science University published today in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.

The lead author is a physician-scientist who provides prenatal care for high-risk pregnancies at OHSU.

Patients are coming to me in their prenatal visits saying, 'I quit smoking and drinking, but is it safe to still use cannabis?' Until direct harms have been proven, they perceive it to be safe to use.""

Jamie Lo, M.D., M.C.R., lead author, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology (maternal-fetal medicine), OHSU School of Medicine

In fact, cannabis remains one of the most common substances used in pregnancy that's still illegal under federal law, and, unlike declines in prenatal use of alcohol or nicotine, cannabis use is continuing to increase. Lo said many of her patients are reluctant to give up cannabis during pregnancy because it helps to reduce common prenatal symptoms such as nausea, insomnia and pain.

Researchers updated the systematic review and meta-analysis, drawing on a total of 51 observational studies involving 21.1 million people to examine the potential adverse effects of cannabis use in pregnancy. The researchers found eight new studies since their previous update, raising the certainty of evidence from ""very-low-to-low"" to ""moderate"" for increased odds of low birth weight, preterm birth and babies being small for their gestational age.

The updated review also indicated increased odds of newborn mortality, though still with low certainty.

Researchers noted that the new systematic review includes a larger proportion of human observational studies examining people who only use cannabis, but don't also use nicotine. And even though the evidence is low to moderate for adverse outcomes, Lo noted that the findings are consistent with definitive evidence in nonhuman primate models exposed to THC, the main psychoactive compound in cannabis.

The related research in animal models included standard prenatal ultrasound and MRI imaging that revealed a detrimental effect on the placenta, in terms of blood flow and availability of oxygen in addition to decreased volume of amniotic fluid.

""These findings tell me as an obstetrician that the placenta is not functioning as it normally would in pregnancy,"" Lo said. ""When the placenta isn't functioning well, it can affect the baby's development and growth.""

Even though cannabis remains a Schedule 1 substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act, Oregon is one of several states that have legalized it under state law for medicinal and recreational use. Lo said she recommends a harm-reduction approach to patients. For those who cannot abstain, she advises them to reduce the amount and frequency of use to help reduce the risk of prenatal and infant complications.

""Even using less can mitigate the risk,"" she said. ""Abstinence is ideal, but it's not realistic for many patients.""

In addition to Lo, co-authors include Snehapriya Yaddala, PharmD., Beth Shaw, M.S., Shannon Robalino, M.S., of OHSU; Chelsea Ayers, M.P.H., Rachel Ward, B.A., of the Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System; and Devan Kansagara, M.D., of OHSU and the Portland VA.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Despite historic indictment, doctors will keep mailing abortion pills across state lines","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250506/Despite-historic-indictment-doctors-will-keep-mailing-abortion-pills-across-state-lines.aspx","Tue, 06 May 2025 10:43:00 GMT","

When the news broke on Jan. 31 that a New York physician had been indicted for shipping abortion medications to a woman in Louisiana, it stoked fear across the network of doctors and medical clinics who engage in similar work.

“It's scary. It's frustrating,” said Angel Foster, co-founder of the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, a clinic near Boston that mails mifepristone and misoprostol pills to patients in states with abortion bans. But, Foster added, “it's not entirely surprising.”

Ever since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, abortion providers like her had been expecting prosecution or another kind of legal challenge from states with abortion bans, she said.

“It was unclear when those tests would come, and would it be against an individual provider or a practice or organization?” she said. “Would it be a criminal indictment, or would it be a civil lawsuit,"" or even an attack on licensure? she wondered. ""All of that was kind of unknown, and we're starting to see some of this play out.”

The indictment also sparked worry among abortion providers like Kohar Der Simonian, medical director for Maine Family Planning. The clinic doesn't mail pills into states with bans, but it does treat patients who travel from those states to Maine for abortion care.

“It just hit home that this is real, like this could happen to anybody, at any time now, which is scary,” Der Simonian said.

Der Simonian and Foster both know the indicted doctor, Margaret Carpenter.

“I feel for her. I very much support her,” Foster said. “I feel very sad for her that she has to go through all of this.”

On Jan. 31, Carpenter became the first U.S. doctor criminally charged for providing abortion pills across state lines — a medical practice that grew after the U.S. Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision on June 24, 2022, which overturned Roe.

Since Dobbs, 12 states have enacted near-total abortion bans, and an additional 10 have outlawed the procedure after a certain point in pregnancy, but before a fetus is viable.

Carpenter was indicted alongside a Louisiana mother who allegedly received the mailed package and gave the pills prescribed by Carpenter to her minor daughter.

The teen wanted to keep the pregnancy and called 911 after taking the pills, according to an NPR and KFF Health News interview with Tony Clayton, the Louisiana local district attorney prosecuting the case. When police responded, they learned about the medication, which carried the prescribing doctor's name, Clayton said.

On Feb. 11, Louisiana's Republican governor, Jeff Landry, signed an extradition warrant for Carpenter. He later posted a video arguing she “must face extradition to Louisiana, where she can stand trial and justice will be served.”

New York's Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, countered by releasing her own video, confirming she was refusing to extradite Carpenter. The charges carry a possible five-year prison sentence.

“Louisiana has changed their laws, but that has no bearing on the laws here in the state of New York,” Hochul said.

Eight states — New York, Maine, California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington — have passed laws since 2022 to protect doctors who mail abortion pills out of state, and thereby block or “shield” them from extradition in such cases. But this is the first criminal test of these relatively new “shield laws.”

The telemedicine practice of consulting with remote patients and prescribing them medication abortion via the mail has grown in recent years — and is now playing a critical role in keeping abortion somewhat accessible in states with strict abortion laws, according to research from the Society of Family Planning, a group that supports abortion access.

Doctors who prescribe abortion pills across state lines describe facing a new reality in which the criminal risk is no longer hypothetical. The doctors say that if they stop, tens of thousands of patients would no longer be able to end early pregnancies safely at home, under the care of a U.S. physician. But the doctors could end up in the crosshairs of a legal clash over the interstate practice of medicine when two states disagree on whether people have a right to end a pregnancy.

Maine Family Planning, a network of clinics across 19 locations, offers abortions, birth control, gender-affirming care, and other services. One patient recently drove over 17 hours from South Carolina, a state with a six-week abortion ban, Der Simonian said.

For Der Simonian, that case illustrates how desperate some of the practice's patients are for abortion access. It's why she supported Maine's 2024 shield law, she said.

Maine Family Planning has discussed whether to start mailing abortion medication to patients in states with bans, but it has decided against it for now, according to Kat Mavengere, a clinic spokesperson.

Reflecting on Carpenter's indictment, Der Simonian said it underscored the stakes for herself — and her clinic — of providing any abortion care to out-of-state patients. Shield laws were written to protect against the possibility that a state with an abortion ban charges and tries to extradite a doctor who performed a legal, in-person procedure on someone who had traveled there from another state, according to a review of shield laws by the Center on Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy at the UCLA School of Law.

“It is a fearful time to do this line of work in the United States right now,” Der Simonian said. “There will be a next case.” And even though Maine's shield law protects abortion providers, she said, “you just don't know what's going to happen.”

Data shows that in states with total or six-week abortion bans, an average of 7,700 people a month were prescribed and took mifepristone and misoprostol to end their pregnancies by out-of-state doctors practicing in states with shield laws. The data, covering the second quarter of 2024, is part of a #WeCount report estimating the volume and types of abortions in the U.S., conducted by the Society of Family Planning.

Among Louisiana residents, nearly 60% of abortions took place via telemedicine in the second half of 2023 (the most recent period for which estimates are available), giving Louisiana the highest rate of telemedicine abortions among states that passed strict bans after Dobbs, according to the #WeCount survey.

Organizations like the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, known as the MAP, are responding to the demand for remote care. The MAP was launched after the Dobbs ruling, with the mission of writing prescriptions for patients in other states.

During 2024, the MAP says, it was mailing abortion medications to about 500 patients a month. In the new year, the monthly average has grown to 3,000 prescriptions a month, said Foster, the group's co-founder.

The majority of the MAP's patients — 80% — live in Texas or states in the Southeast, a region blanketed with near-total abortion restrictions, Foster said.

But the recent indictment from Louisiana will not change the MAP's plans, Foster said. The MAP currently has four staff doctors and is hiring one more.

“I think there will be some providers who will step out of the space, and some new providers will step in. But it has not changed our practice,” Foster said. “It has not changed our intention to continue to practice.”

The MAP's organizational structure was designed to spread potential liability, Foster said.

“The person who orders the pills is different than the person who prescribes the pills, is different from the person who ships the pills, is different from the person who does the payments,” she explained.

In 22 states and Washington, D.C., Democratic leaders helped establish shield laws or similarly protective executive orders, according to the UCLA School of Law review of shield laws.

The review found that in eight states, the shield law applies to in-person and telemedicine abortions. In the other 14 states plus Washington, D.C., the protections do not explicitly extend to abortion via telemedicine.

Most of the shield laws also apply to civil lawsuits against doctors. Over a month before Louisiana indicted Carpenter, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a civil suit against her. A Texas judge ruled against Carpenter on Feb. 13, imposing penalties of more than $100,000.

By definition, state shield laws cannot protect doctors when they leave the state. If they move or even travel elsewhere, they lose the first state's protection and risk arrest in the destination state, and maybe extradition to a third state.

Physicians doing this type of work accept there are parts of the U.S. where they should no longer go, said Julie F. Kay, a human rights lawyer who helps doctors set up telemedicine practices.

“There's really a commitment not to visit those banned and restricted states,” said Kay, who worked with Carpenter to help start the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine.

“We didn't have anybody going to the Super Bowl or Mardi Gras or anything like that,” Kay said of the doctors who practice abortion telemedicine across state lines.

She said she has talked to other interested doctors who decided against doing it “because they have an elderly parent in Florida, or a college student somewhere, or family in the South.” Any visits, even for a relative's illness or death, would be too risky.

“I don't use the word ‘hero' lightly or toss it around, but it's a pretty heroic level of providing care,” Kay said.

Carpenter's case remains unresolved. New York's rebuff of Louisiana's extradition request shows the state's shield law is working as designed, according to David Cohen and Rachel Rebouché, law professors with expertise in abortion laws.

Louisiana officials, for their part, have pushed back in social media posts and media interviews.

“It is not any different than if she had sent fentanyl here. It's really not,” Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told Fox 8 News in New Orleans. “She sent drugs that are illegal to send into our state.”

Louisiana's next step would be challenging New York in federal courts, according to legal experts across the political spectrum.

NPR and KFF Health News asked Clayton, the Louisiana prosecutor who charged Carpenter, whether Louisiana has plans to do that. Clayton declined to answer.

A major problem with the new shield laws is that they challenge the basic fabric of U.S. law, which relies on reciprocity between states, including in criminal cases, said Thomas Jipping, a senior legal fellow with the Heritage Foundation, which supports a national abortion ban.

“This actually tries to undermine another state's ability to enforce its own laws, and that's a very grave challenge to this tradition in our country,” Jipping said. “It's unclear what legal issues, or potentially constitutional issues, it may raise.”

But other legal scholars disagree with Jipping's interpretation. The U.S. Constitution requires extradition only for those who commit crimes in one state and then flee to another state, said Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University's Thomas R. Kline School of Law.

Telemedicine abortion providers aren't located in states with abortion bans and have not fled from those states — therefore they aren't required to be extradited back to those states, Cohen said. If Louisiana tries to take its case to federal court, he said, “they're going to lose because the Constitution is clear on this.”

“The shield laws certainly do undermine the notion of interstate cooperation, and comity, and respect for the policy choices of each state,” Cohen said, “but that has long been a part of American law and history.”

When states make different policy choices, sometimes they're willing to give up those policy choices to cooperate with another state, and sometimes they're not, he said.

The conflicting legal theories will be put to the test if this case goes to federal court, other legal scholars said.

“It probably puts New York and Louisiana in real conflict, potentially a conflict that the Supreme Court is going to have to decide,” said Rebouché, dean of the Temple University Beasley School of Law.

Rebouché, Cohen, and law professor Greer Donley worked together to draft a proposal for how state shield laws might work. Connecticut passed the first law — though it did not include protections specifically for telemedicine. It was signed by the state's governor in May 2022, over a month before the Supreme Court overturned Roe, in anticipation of potential future clashes between states over abortion rights.

In some shield-law states, there's a call to add more protections in response to Carpenter's indictment.

New York state officials have. On Feb. 3, Hochul signed a law that allows physicians to name their clinic as the prescriber — instead of using their own names — on abortion medications they mail out of state. The intent is to make it more difficult to indict individual doctors. Der Simonian is pushing for a similar law in Maine.

Samantha Glass, a family medicine physician in New York, has written such prescriptions in a previous job, and plans to find a clinic where she could offer that again. Once a month, she travels to a clinic in Kansas to perform in-person abortions.

Carpenter's indictment could cause some doctors to stop sending pills to states with bans, Glass said. But she believes abortion should be as accessible as any other health care.

“Someone has to do it. So why wouldn't it be me?” Glass said. “I just think access to this care is such a lifesaving thing for so many people that I just couldn't turn my back on it.”

Light conversion technology developed by University of Queensland researchers will be used for wearable X-ray devices that make respiratory scans more comfortable for young children.

Associate Professor Jingwei Hou from UQ's School of Chemical Engineering has been awarded a $1.6 million Investigator grant from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) to produce a flexible, glass-based X-ray imaging detector that can be worn in a hoodie or blanket to provide a quick and accurate picture of a child's lungs.

Dr. Hou said the project was inspired by the thought of his own young children being distressed by a noisy MRI machine and potentially having to be sedated or restrained in order to obtain an accurate scan. 

Staying still during a lengthy scan under a big machine isn't easy for adults, let alone young, overwhelmed children who are already unwell and distressed in an unfamiliar and daunting clinical environment. 

Unfortunately this often means sedation or general anaesthesia is required to keep children still so the scan is accurate, which introduces additional risks and complexities.''

Dr. Jingwei Hou, Associate Professor from UQ's School of Chemical Engineering 

Dr. Hou said scanning was a crucial process in the treatment of conditions such as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and chronic lung disease, which are among the most critical health issues faced by premature babies, infants and children under 5 - particularly First Nations children. 

But he said current X-ray technology merely captures a flat projection of a 3D object, meaning numerous scans from different angles are required to render computed tomography (CT) results, potentially leading to high radiation exposure.

To solve the issue, Dr Hou will adapt his patented quantum dot hybrid glass technology into thin film strips that that conform to the contour and movement of a child's body and can be worn like a favourite blanket or jumper. 

""My quantum dot technology makes use of a family of materials known for their unparalleled light conversion and emission efficiency,"" Dr Hou said. 

""By assembling these materials into thin, flexible X-ray detectors I can create a wearable X-ray detector that is both comfortable while still providing high-resolution imaging of lung structure.""

An ARC Future Fellow, Dr Hou said the project has potential to be adapted for a range of medical imaging applications, including other paediatric conditions and adult diseases where rapid, high-resolution imaging was critical. 

However the most pressing issue in his mind is to ease the discomfort and stress faced by young children during an already difficult time. 

""As a father, it is not nice to think of my children going through an uncomfortable scanning process that could involve sedating or restraining them,"" Dr. Hou said. 

""For a while I have thought there has to be a better way of doing this, and now I think we've found it.""

Dr. Hou's Investigator grant covers salaries and costs for 5 years of research and testing, after which it is hoped the system will be ready for clinical trials.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Michele Kang is spending millions to scoop up women's soccer teams around the world. What's her plan?","https://www.espn.com.sg/soccer/story/_/id/44971711/michele-kang-interview-nwsl-spirit-lyon-transforming-women-soccer","Tue, 06 May 2025 12:27:32 GMT","

Welcome to the ESPN Singapore Edition

Sebastian Salazar reacts to Michele Kang's $30 million donation to U.S. Soccer. (2:37)

LOS ANGELES -- When club owner and magnate Michele Kang sat in the ""Futbol W"" studio in L.A. to speak with ESPN, there was an obvious question lingering -- and one without an obvious answer.

Earlier that day, Kang announced her latest large investment in the U.S. Soccer Federation at an event a few blocks away. Seemingly everyone in town for the game between the U.S. women's national team and Brazil was asking the same question: Why? Why had Kang, who owns three professional women's soccer teams, offered to hand over to U.S. Soccer a business she poured $25 million into building -- after she already committed to donating $30 million to the federation over the next five years?

The question comes with some awe, but it is accompanied by the confusion that surrounds a first-of-its-kind splash. Kang, who has been building what appears to be the women's soccer version of City Football Group, has expanded her empire dramatically in a short time. So why donate elsewhere?

""At the end of the day, our vision and our goal is to get all the female teams to adopt these new standards and the way we train our female athletes,"" Kang told ESPN. ""I thought that would be much better accomplished by an organization like U.S. Soccer as opposed to something private.""

Kang is trying to transform the women's game by bringing more young players in and raising standards -- not just in the U.S. but around the world -- and a task that big requires buy-in from others. As Kang put it: ""We need to do this on a massive scale, because we're talking about half of this population.""

Kang has found an unlikely ally in USWNT head coach Emma Hayes. Hayes comes from a long soccer background that Kang readily admits she doesn't have, but both women speak similarly about detesting constant comparisons to the men's game and both emphasize the need to view everything through ""a female lens,"" as Hayes recently detailed in her long-term plan for U.S. Soccer.

""[All parties] need to come together to make this product, women's football, women's soccer, the best sports entertainment product,"" Kang told ESPN. ""And it's not that simple, unlike most of the businesses where you just go into a factory and you build something and you come out. But here, multiple stakeholders, both private and governing bodies, they all need to work together.""

Kang is a self-made billionaire who, until about five years ago, never thought about owning a sports franchise. Since then, she's become one of the most prominent single owners in women's soccer. She's now the majority owner of the Washington Spirit in the NWSL, French giants Olympique Lyonnais and England's London City Lionesses. She also told ESPN she has imminent plans to add a fourth team on a new continent.

Her plan from the beginning was to pool resources to quickly scale up a global network of clubs -- something unprecedented for an operation exclusively focused on women's soccer.

Kang is used to being questioned -- it is an occupational hazard of being a disruptor, which Kang has been in women's soccer since her then-record purchase of the Washington Spirit in 2022. Her $35 million valuation of the Spirit when she assumed majority control of the team was 10 times greater than another NWSL team sale two years earlier. At the time, she reminds everyone to this day, people questioned why she would spend so much.

What has followed since is proof of concept. The record valuation for an NWSL team sale was broken twice last year, reaching $250 million for Angel City. Expansion fees have grown from about $2 million five years ago to $110 million, which a new group in Denver will pay to bring the NWSL to 16 teams next year.

She said she received similar criticism for spinning off Lyon's women's team into separate ownership from the men's team, but she has heard about other clubs planning to do the same thing.

""I can tell you when I first spun off Olympique Lyonnais from the men's team, there were a lot of criticisms,"" Kang said. ""It's like, 'That can't happen,' and all that. Now, actually, the top teams both in France and England are doing it.""

Kang says she is not trying to create some kind of player development network that feeds players to one team, which is one of the criticisms of the multi-club model on the men's side -- like, say, City Football Group ultimately serving Manchester City. As she put it: ""I'm not going to rob the best players from one team and give them to another team."" Rather, she wants to create ""the No. 1 team in each country.""

Her ambition to be on new continents stems from the idea that seeing is believing: ""I don't want the young girls growing up thinking that whatever women's-specific training methodology, dedicated stadium, state-of-the-art training centers are sort of an American, English, French phenomenon. It's going to be in their backyard.""

Despite the comparisons Kang's model has drawn to ownership groups in the men's game (where she holds a minority stake in Eagle Football Group, which owns multiple men's teams), Kang insists she is forging something new.

""The worst thing we can do to women's football is to copy and paste"" what the men's game has been doing for decades, Kang said. That means determining a competitive format that works for the women's game, for instance, or building a different business model that, unlike a City Football Group or Red Bull's soccer network, is not so reliant on making money off the transfer market, which is still developing on the women's side.

""Our product, in our opinion, is fundamentally different -- and I think men's team owners will say the same thing,"" she said.

Two years into her multi-club model, Kang looks right on track. The Washington Spirit finished second in the NWSL and runners-up in the playoffs in 2024, barely falling on each occasion to a historic Orlando Pride team that went 23 games unbeaten to open the season. Washington hired Jonatan Giráldez away from global power FC Barcelona to become the team's head coach.

Lyon just clinched its 18th French league title in the past 19 seasons, although the eight-time European champions were upset by Arsenal in the UEFA Women's Champions League semifinals. Over the weekend, London City won promotion to England's top flight in Kang's first full season as owner, making them the only independently owned club to participate in next season's Women's Super League.

None of that is by coincidence. Kang has invested in staff (such as Giráldez), infrastructure (such as improvements to training facilities) and players (such as Trinity Rodman, whom Kang said she'll ""do everything we can"" to keep from leaving the club when her contract expires later this year).

Kang's vision extends to all women's sports. Last year she donated $4 million to the U.S. women's rugby sevens team to provide resources ahead of the 2028 L.A. Olympics.

This is still a business, however, as she is quick to remind everyone. Men's sports team owners have historically lost money until they sell. Women's sports are still fighting against the perception that they aren't good business long term, which, according to Kang, demands a more immediate return on investment.

""One of the very important aspects of what I'm doing is I want to prove that women's sports in general, that women's football is good business,"" Kang said. ""No business can survive by losing money forever, right? So at least break even.""

With a smile and her fingers crossed in front of her, she says the Spirit will ""hopefully"" break even in the near future. Washington finished fourth in the NWSL in average attendance last year -- nearly 14,000 fans per game -- and attendance is up this year.

Imitation might be the sincerest form of flattery for Kang's approach. The multi-club model is in vogue, and more women's soccer club owners are expanding their portfolios in the footsteps of Kang.

Bay FC's owners, Sixth Street, announced plans earlier this year to create a similar global network. Kansas City Current majority owners Angie and Chris Long, who funded the NWSL's first purpose-built stadium as the anchor of a $1 billion waterfront development, previously confirmed to ESPN that more clubs will soon be added to their portfolio. A group called Mercury/13 launched a multi-club model last year, first with the purchase of Italy's FC Como Women.

The recently launched Monarch Collective is dedicated to exclusively investing in women's sports teams and already holds stakes in Angel City FC, Boston Legacy FC and San Diego Wave FC -- the maximum (three) allowed by the NWSL's private equity rules. Avenue Sports Group, led by former Milwaukee Bucks owner Marc Lasry, is focused on NWSL and WNBA investment and held serious discussions with at least four NWSL teams previously for sale.

Kang welcomes others to join her: ""I'm actually seeing either intent or already moving in that direction [from] several groups already,"" she said. ""I'm hearing so-and-so is buying this team and so forth. So, this is happening.""

Kang has fielded questions about what she's doing -- the multi-club model, but also her Kynisca Innovation Hub that is ""dedicated to revolutionizing how female athletes train"" -- from more people privately.

""Women's football is kind of exploding,"" she told ESPN. The bad news, she quickly adds, is the lack of infrastructure and resources in place around it, including staffing and player development.

""We all need to move all those things together to really advance this game so that we don't miss a beat,"" Kang said, ""because the last thing we need is: somehow, right now, things are really great, but what's the sustaining power?""

Kang's rhetorical question is the short answer to people asking ""Why?""

Her plan is to boost investment in a space that has historically lacked it, much like any other business opportunity. How? Infrastructure, better player development and more training to build out a larger, more qualified network of staff. The money she has donated to U.S. Soccer is all earmarked for those initiatives.

With that foundation, the product of women's soccer can flourish at a scale beyond just a few clubs -- that's the plan, at least.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com.sg', 'title': 'ESPN Singapore'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Christian Pulisic's AC Milan fate emerges as USMNT star prepares for crucial final","https://www.themirror.com/sport/soccer/christian-pulisic-ac-milan-usmnt-1135352","Tue, 06 May 2025 16:12:00 GMT","

As the Coppa Italia final against Bologna looms for AC Milan, U.S. Men's National Team and Rossoneri star Christian Pulisic's future with the Serie A giants appears to have been confirmed.

With a thoroughly disappointing domestic season nearing its conclusion, and no European soccer next year a very real possibility for Milan, the roster looks set for a potentially mammoth overhaul in the summer.

However, having led the Rossoneri in goals this season, with 16 in all competitions, it appears that Pulisic is safe for another year, along with fellow midfielder, Tijjani Reijnders.

With Reijnders having recently put pen to paper on a new deal, and Pulisic seemingly set to follow suit, it appears that the midfield maestros will form the building blocks of Milan's rebuild, as per La Gazzetta dello Sport.

Others who may yet join them as cornerstones of a new-look Milan include goalkeeper Mike Maignan and defender Theo Hernandez, both of whom have had discussions with the front office over new deals.

That being said, Hernandez has also recently been linked with a move back to Real Madrid, six years after he departed La Liga for Serie A, as per Dario AS.

Unfortunately, this seemingly impending clear-out of the Milan roster could spell the end for, among others, USMNT midfielder Yunus Musah.

Having joined from Valencia in 2023 for around $22 million, Musah has failed to find his footing at the San Siro, used largely as a substitute this season and still yet to find the back of the net for Sergio Conceicao's side.

As for Conceicao, who it also appears is likely heading for the exit this summer either via a resignation or by force, he could yet leave Milan on a high note, having now guided his team to back to back to back wins for the first time during his tenure, following their 2-1 win at Genoa on Monday.

Far from an all-time classic, Milan had to wait until the 76th minute to bounce back from Vitinha's earlier goal, with Rafael Leao's heavily deflected shot finding its way past Nicola Leali.

The comeback was then completed just over a minute later, as Genoa's Morten Frendrup scored an unfortunate own goal off a Leao cross, while attempting to beat Joao Felix to the ball.

As for Pulisic, who started just behind forward Luka Jovic, he wound up playing nearly 80 minutes before being replaced by Musah.

Ultimately, the three points made little difference for Milan, who remain ninth in Serie A, six points behind Lazio in the final European qualification spot.

With just three league games remaining, a summer of significant change looms for Milan, who face the daunting prospect of a year without continental soccer, unless they win the upcoming Coppa Italia final against Bologna on May 14. A win at the Stadio Olimpico in Roma would ensure UEFA Europa League soccer next year.

FIFA Club World Cup

Los Angeles FC will play Club America in a one-off playoff to determine the final place in this summer's Club World Cup.

The winners of the playoff, which is expected to take place on May 31 but for which FIFA are yet to confirm details, will take the place of Club Leon in Group D for the newly-expanded tournament.

Advertisement

The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said earlier on Tuesday it had rejected the appeals filed by Mexican teams Club Leon, Pachuca and from Costa Rican side Liga Deportiva Alajuelense (LDA) relating to the Club World Cup.

CAS judged that Leon and Pachuca did not meet the competition's regulations concerning multi-club ownership, with both clubs majority-owned by Grupo Pachuca. That decision led to Leon's expulsion from the tournament, while a separate appeal by LDA to fill that void was also rejected by CAS.

FIFA confirmed on March 21 that Leon had been removed from the competition after Grupo Pachuca “failed to meet the criteria on multi-club ownership”, which the group subsequently unsuccessfully appealed.

FIFA said later in March it was considering hosting a play-off game between Club America and LAFC to replace Leon, with the former being the highest-ranked Concacaf team not already at the tournament and the latter having lost to Leon in the 2023 Concacaf Champions League final.

As the winner of that final, Leon were due to participate at the Club World Cup as one of four Concacaf qualifiers alongside fellow Mexican sides Monterrey (winners of the 2021 Champions League) and Pachuca (winners of the 2024 Champions League) and American side Seattle Sounders (winners of the 2023 Champions League). Inter Miami qualified in the extra spot awarded a team from the host nation as the winners of the 2024 MLS Supporters' Shield.

Costa Rican side LDA were ranked below Club America of Mexico in the Concacaf rankings, but they were the highest-ranked team outside of Mexico. FIFA's guidelines for the Club World Cup state that each nation should not have more than two representatives at the competition unless they are the winners of the confederation's annual tournament, such as the Champions League.

Whoever replaces Leon in Group D at the Club World Cup will face English side Chelsea, ES Tunis of Tunisia and Brazilian club Flamengo. If LAFC qualifies, it would see French striker Olivier Giroud come up against his former club Chelsea, where he won the Champions League, FA Cup and Europa League during a four-year spell.

The Club World Cup begins on June 14, with the final to be held at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey on July 13.

Analysis from The Athletic's Football Finance Writer Chris Weatherspoon

As well as a spot in the expanded Club World Cup, the winners of this play-off will, in effect, guarantee themselves a decent chunk of cash too. FIFA have confirmed all four participating CONCACAF teams will receive $9.55million just for making it to this summer's tournament, so there are both sporting and financial incentives on offer for Los Angeles FC and Club America.

While that's the minimum the play-off winners will earn, it opens the way for them to bank far more. A performance prize pot of $475m is on offer for the 32 participating teams, with the potential for one team to earn $87.6m for winning just seven games.

Doing so would require not only winning the whole tournament, but every game they play in. That looks a tall order for LAFC and Club America, who are long shots when pitted against more illustrious European clubs.

Yet even getting through the group stage would see the pair double their money. Reaching the round of 16 earns clubs $7.5m, with group wins worth $2m apiece and draws $1m.

The riches of the expanded club competition will be particularly attractive to Club America. The Mexican club is undertaking works to improve its famous Azteca Stadium ahead of the 2026 World Cup, with $75m already spent on the remodel and a further $105m loan recently obtained from Bonarte, a Mexican bank. A boost to club coffers this summer will strengthen the club's hand in repaying the loan, which spans a 12-year term and will see the Azteca renamed Estadio Bonarte over that time.

The Club World Cup used to take place every December and was contested by the winners of the six continental club competitions, as well as the host nation's domestic league champions. It featured a team from each of FIFA's confederations: the winners of the AFC Champions League (Asia), CAF Champions League (Africa), Concacaf Champions League (North America, Central America and the Caribbean), Copa Libertadores (South America), OFC Champions League (Oceania) and UEFA Champions League (Europe).

The new competition follows the 32-team format from the old FIFA World Cup. Teams will be drawn into eight groups of four, with each side playing their group opponents once. The top two of each group will progress to the round of 16 and from there it will be single-match knockouts through to the final.

The opening game will be held at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium on June 15 and the final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey — where the 2026 World Cup final will be held — on July 13.

Games will take place in Georgia, Florida, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Washington, North Carolina, Ohio, California, Tennessee and Washington D.C.

Of the 32 places at the tournament, 31 have been filled with clubs qualifying via either a ranking pathway based on performances over a four-year period or by winning continental titles between 2021 and 2024. The only exception is Inter Miami, who qualified via the host nation place by winning the 2024 Supporters' Shield, awarded to the MLS team with the best regular-season record.

The 2025 Club World Cup draw was made in December.

The Club World Cup has a $1billion prize pot, which will be shared between the 32 competing teams. FIFA's prize pot owes much to the $1bn broadcast deal struck with DAZN in December.

Almost half of the total prize pot — $475m — will be shared based on sporting performance, with payments shaped by a team's progress in the competition and teams will then get a further participation payment.

The 12 European clubs will also get between $12.8m and $38.2m in a “ranking based on sporting and commercial criteria”, with the six South American clubs getting a flat fee of $15.2m. Auckland City, the only Oceania club, will receive $3.58m, with the rest, from North and Central America, Africa and Asia, receiving $9.55m for qualifying.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Real Madrid ready to pay Liverpool and get Alexander-Arnold for Club World Cup","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/06/real-madrid-trent-alexander-arnold-club-world-cup-liverpool-fee","Tue, 06 May 2025 15:56:00 GMT","

Real Madrid have approached Liverpool in an attempt to bring forward the signing of Trent Alexander-Arnold so that he is available to play in the Club World Cup, which starts on 14 June in the United States. The right-back is set to join the Spanish side when his contract expires at the end of June, but Madrid are eager to take him earlier.

Any agreement would lead to Liverpool receiving a fee. Fifa has implemented a two-window summer to benefit those playing at the Club World Cup, with the first lasting from 1 to 10 June and the second opening on 16 June. Madrid's first fixture is on 18 June against Al-Hilal at the Hard Rock Cafe Stadium in Miami.

Alexander-Arnold, who helped Liverpool win the Club World Cup in 2019, announced on Monday that he would not be renewing his contract after two decades with Liverpool, having started in the academy aged six. He is yet to confirm Madrid is his next destination, but is expected to move there on a five-year deal.

“After 20 years at Liverpool Football Club, now is the time for me to confirm that I will be leaving at the end of the season,” said Alexander-Arnold. “This is easily the hardest decision I've ever made in my life. I know many of you have wondered why or been frustrated that I haven't spoken about this yet, but it was always my intention to keep my full focus on the team's best interests, which was securing number 20,” referring to the club's 20th league title.

Madrid's eagerness to accelerate Alexander-Arnold's arrival is partly down to the problems they have at right-back. The veteran defender Dani Carvajal is out injured with ­cruciate ligament damage and the forward Lucas Vázquez has been ­filling in for his Spain teammate.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Alexander-Arnold won two Premier League titles and the Champions League with Liverpool

Real Madrid are aiming to complete the signing of Trent Alexander-Arnold before the start of the Club World Cup.

The England defender has confirmed he will leave Liverpool when his contract expires this summer and the 26-year-old is expected to join the Spanish club as a free agent.

Alexander-Arnold's contract with Liverpool expires on 30 June but the Club World Cup begins 16 days earlier.

BBC Sport understands Real have approached Liverpool with a view to negotiating a deal to release Alexander-Arnold in time for the full-back to be part of their plans for the Fifa-organised tournament in the United States.

It is understood the Spanish club are considering an offer of about £850,000 to release Alexander-Arnold early from his deal. 

It has also been suggested Real might be willing to pay the wages Liverpool owe  Alexander-Arnold as they seek a solution.

Discussions between all parties are described as amicable.

World football governing body Fifa has confirmed there will be a short initial transfer window this summer - running from 1 to 10 June - which is designed for clubs competing in the Club World Cup to amend their squads in time for the competition.

Real's desire to land Alexander-Arnold in time for the tournament presents an opportunity for Liverpool to recoup at least some money for a high-value player who will otherwise leave Anfield for no fee.

 Los Angeles FC

 will play Club America in a one-off match to qualify for the Club World Cup, with GIVEMESPORT able to exclusively reveal the match will take place on May 31 at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles.    


It is effectively a $10 million match, as the winner will gain a guaranteed entry fee of $9.55 million, plus an additional $2 million per group stage win and round-by-round prize money. The winner will be placed in the final spot of Group D, alongside                             Chelsea

, Flamengo and ES Tunis.    

This spot opened up due to Club Leon being removed from the Club World Cup for a breach of multi-club rules. Club Leon and CF Pachuca are both part of Grupo Pachuca, while CF Pachuca will remain in the tournament.

Club Leon will not compete in the Club World Cup after their appeal to be reinstated was rejected

The Court of Arbitration has rejected Club Leon's appeal to be reinstated in the Club World Cup on Tuesday.

Leon had argued the club had been sufficiently placed in a blind trust, removing any conflict from both sides competing at the Club World Cup, but CAS rejected this argument.

Alajuelense have also failed in their appeal to take the vacant spot after initially flagging a conflict between Leon and Pachuca.

LAFC have been picked because they finished as the runners-up to Leon in the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League, while Club America top the co-efficient rankings for the four-year qualification cycle in question.

The expanded FIFA Club World Cup, which will feature 32 of the best teams from around the world, will be held in its new format in 11 venues across the USA one year before the 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup.

Chelsea's opening opponents at this summer's FIFA Club World Cup remain unknown after Mexican club Leon's appeal to be reinstated was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

CAS announced on Tuesday it had dismissed appeals by Leon and Pachuca, upholding an earlier decision by FIFA that the clubs breached tournament regulations related to multi-club ownership.

Leon's appeal against their expulsion from the tournament on those grounds was dismissed by CAS, which also rejected an appeal from a Costa Rican club LD Alajuelense, who were seeking to be added to the competition in Leon's place.

CAS said that as a result of the ruling, FIFA would be responsible for deciding who should replace Leon.

Chelsea qualified for the Club World Cup via their Champions League triumph in 2021.

They will be one of two English teams at the tournament in the United States, with Manchester City qualifying as 2023 Champions League winners.

Chelsea were due to face Leon in their opening game in Atlanta on June 16. Their other group stage opponents are Esperance of Tunisia and Brazilian club Flamengo.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport turned down Mexican club León's appeal to FIFA regarding their entry into the FIFA Club World Cup this summer.

Club León's last ditch effort to keep their place in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup failed, as the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled against the Liga MX club in their appeal of FIFA's decision to disqualify them from the competition.

Back in March, FIFA announced it's decision to remove León from the inaugural, new-look Club World Cup because the team is owned by Grupo Pachuca, the same group that owns fellow Liga MX side and Club World Cup participant, Pachuca. Multi-ownership is prohibited under Club World Cup regulations.

Lawyers from both Pachuca and León made their case to CAS in a hearing that lasted almost 12 hours on Monday, May 5, but were unsuccessful. Today, CAS released a statement ratifying FIFA's ruling— a decision that is unappealable. 

""The CAS Panel ruled that Pachuca and Club León failed to meet the criteria in the Regulations for the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 concerning multiple club ownership,"" the statement said. ""Consequently, Club León remains excluded from the competition and Pachuca remains qualified. As a result of the CAS ruling, FIFA is responsible for designating the final qualified team to participate in the Club World Cup 2025.""

Club León released a statement of their own saying, ""The sentence was harsh, the rivals very influential, the pressure intense, and the stakes very high. As a club we assume the consequences, but those who have suffered most along the way have been our people: fans and footballers deserve more respect from an organization dedicated to promoting sports. But from the beginning, no sporting principle existed in this case.""

León originally secured a place in the Club World cup by winning the 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup. The club signed former Real Madrid player and international star James Rodríguez this past winter as their marquee addition for the competition. 

As for who will replace León, FIFA President Gianni Infantino already confirmed the intention to have MLS side LAFC and Liga MX team Club América play a playoff match with the final ticket to the Club World Cup on the line. At the time, Infantino's comments didn't sit well with Club León, but now, there's nothing to stop FIFA from moving forward with those plans. 

The scheduled date of the playoff match is yet to be determined, but whoever wins will replace Club León in Group D of the tournament, where they'll face Espérance Sportive de Tunisie (TUN), Flamengo (BRA) and Premier League giants Chelsea.

After being banned from the FIFA Club World Cup due to multi-club ownership rules, Club Leon has lost their appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport and will need to be replaced at the tournament which will begin on June 14. To replace Leon in Group D alongside Chelsea, Flamengo, and Esperance Sportive de Tunis, FIFA has announced a one-game playoff between Los Angeles FC and Club America to determine that last spot.

These teams were determined due to LAFC being the runner-up to Leon in the 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup and Club America being the top-ranked team in the FIFA Club World Cup confederation rankings. This playoff creates quite the opportunity for these teams as each Concacaf club participating in the tournament will receive $9.55 million in prize money from FIFA. This is before being able to win $2 million per win and $1 million per draw during the group stage.

It's quite a sum for any club, and is more than either can earn via their respective leagues, adding additional pressure to that playoff match. According to GiveMeSport, LAFC will host the playoff match at BMO Stadium on May 31. LAFC currently has a match facing the Colorado Rapids scheduled for that day, while Club America will be free as the Liga MX Clausura playoffs will have concluded by then.

""FIFA welcomes the decision taken by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to reject the appeals of CF Pachuca, Club León and Asociación Liga Deportiva Alajuelense in relation to the FIFA Club World Cup 2025,"" FIFA said in a statement.

Leon's ban stems from both Leon and Pachuca being owned by Pachuca Group. With plans to put Leon up for sale not materializing in time, only one of those teams could participate in the tournament and the one that will continue is Pachuca. Pachuca and Leon's appeal to CAS was based around both clubs still complying with the Club World Cup eligibility to participate but it was deemed not to be the case.

Costa Rican side Alajuelense also filed an appeal with CAS that if one of Leon or Pachuca were removed form the tournament that they should be the team to replace them. CAS did hear that case before rejecting it. That rejection leaves it in FIFA's hands for how the empty spot in Group D will be filled.

Alongside other clubs taking part in the tournament, Leon had beefed up their roster adding James Rodriguez to the side but while he won't have a chance to lead them to a Club World Cup title, he will have a chance to lead them to a Liga MX Clausura title as they'll take on Cruz Azul in the quarterfinals on Thursday in that tournament.

There is officially a path towards a third MLS team qualifying for this summer's FIFA 2025 Club World Cup, with the sport's governing body announcing Tuesday that LAFC will face Club América in a playoff match to determine who replaces Club León in the global tournament.

Should LAFC win, they would join Seattle Sounders FC (2022 Concacaf Champions Cup winner) and Inter Miami CF (host nation spot) when the 32-team tournament unfolds from June 14 to July 13 across the United States.

The LAFC-Club América date, venue, kickoff time, ticket sales and broadcast info will be communicated at a later date.

Club León qualified as 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup winners, but FIFA rules state that clubs competing at this summer's Club World Cup cannot share owners.

Club León and fellow LIGA MX side CF Pachuca, who qualified as 2024 Concacaf Champions Cup winners and will remain in the tournament, are both owned by Grupo Pachuca.

That decision was brought to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which upheld FIFA's stance after appeals from CF Pachuca, Club León and Costa Rican side Alajuelense.

LAFC were selected as 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup runners-up, having lost that year's final to Club León (3-1 aggregate).

Meanwhile, Club América were chosen as the top-ranked team in the FIFA Club World Cup ranking at the conclusion of the 2024 edition of the Concacaf Champions Cup.

At the Club World Cup, the LAFC-Club América playoff winner will replace Club León in Group D alongside Chelsea (England), Flamengo (Brazil) and ES Tunis (Tunisia).

Club León's Group D matches were scheduled as follows, with the first two games respectively held at home venues for Atlanta United and Nashville SC:

Perennial MLS Cup contenders in the Western Conference, LAFC are led by forward Denis Bouanga. The Gabon international has earned two consecutive MLS Best XI nods (2023, '24) while scoring 20 league goals in back-to-back years. He also won the 2023 MLS Golden Boot presented by Audi.

Additional stars include French national team legends Olivier Giroud and Hugo Lloris, as well as rising Venezuelan winger David Martínez and center back Aaron Long.

LAFC are coached by Steve Cherundolo, who will depart the club at season's end to return to Germany. Cherundolo led the club to an MLS Cup-Supporters' Shield double in 2022, plus the 2024 US Open Cup title.

Club América are one of Mexico's premier teams, having won a record seven Concacaf Champions Cup titles and 16 LIGA MX titles.

Led by manager André Jardine, star players include goalkeeper Luis Malagón, midfielder Álvaro Fidalgo, winger Alejandro Zendejas and forward Víctor Dávila. Zendejas is a former FC Dallas homegrown who represents the US men's national team.

Last year's Campeones Cup winners over the Columbus Crew, Las Águilas finished second in the recently-competed LIGA MX Clausura standings. They'll play Pachuca in the upcoming Liguilla playoffs.

The expanded 32-team Club World Cup will be held this summer across the United States from June 14 to July 13.

Teams are drawn into eight groups of four teams per group, playing in a single-game round-robin format. The top two teams per group reach the Round of 16, commencing a single-match knockout stage until the final.

Concacaf teams earn a guaranteed $9.55 million for participating in the Club World Cup, then up to $87.625 million if they win all three Group Stage games and eventually lift the title in the July 13 final at MetLife Stadium – resulting in $97.175 million of potential winnings.

Seven MLS stadiums are among the 12 venues selected to host games.","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

Club Leon won the Concacaf Champions Cup in 2023

Club Leon have failed with an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) against FIFA's decision to remove them from the Club World Cup.

Fifa determined in March that Club Leon and fellow Mexican team Pachuca did not meet tournament regulations on multi-club ownership.

Because both clubs are owned by Grupo Pachuca, Fifa removed Club Leon from the tournament which is being held in the United States from 15 June to 13 July.

Cas received separate appeals from Pachuca and Club Leon seeking to annul the decision and declare that the clubs comply with the Club World Cup eligibility requirements.

Club Leon also filed an additional appeal against the decision by the Fifa secretary general, seeking to be reinstated in the competition.

However, Cas upheld Fifa's original decision and said in a statement that a panel found that Club Leon ""failed to meet the criteria in the regulations"".

""The panel examined the evidence, including the Club Leon trust set up by the owners of the club, and concluded that this trust was insufficient to comply with the regulations,"" said a Cas statement.

""Consequently, Club Leon remains excluded from the competition and Pachuca remains qualified.""

Cas also dismissed an appeal made by Costa Rican side Liga Deportiva Alajuelense (LDA), who said they should be admitted to the Club World Cup as the next eligible team.

LDA had lifted the 2023 Central American Cup, but Cas said it rejected the appeal ""with reasons to follow later"" and said Fifa was ""responsible for designating the final qualified team to participate"".

As BBC Sport reported in March, Major League Soccer side LAFC and Mexican team Club America are now set to play a one-off play-off game for the final spot in the Club World Cup.

LAFC were beaten by Club Leon in the 2023 Concacaf Champions League final, while Club America are the highest-ranked team behind Club Leon in confederation ranking that did not qualify for the competition.

The winners of the match are set to take Club Leon's spot in Group D alongside Chelsea, Flamengo and Esperance Sportive de Tunis.

More than 70 percent of the NBCUniversal-owned Spanish language network's lineup will be live next season, including the NFL, NBA, and World Cup.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	At a moment where the TV business is undergoing a dramatic transformation, and with the advertising business similarly in flux amid tariffs and technological changes, NBCUniversal's Spanish-language media division Telemundo Enterprises is betting that live events and programming — a lot of them — will help it stand out in a marketplace that is as crowded as ever.


	Executives at the company say that over 70 percent of Telemundo's lineup will be live over the next season, including NFL and NBA games, live news and entertainment specials, and next year's FIFA World Cup, where Telemundo has the Spanish-language rights.

	Much of it will stream on Peacock of course, but for Telemundo it is also a game plan to shore up linear, giving its lineup as much can't miss programming as possible.

	“The content is the key. You need a strategy, a vision, a mission, resources, investment,” says Luis Fernández, chairman of NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises, in an interview. “We need to defend our linear TV. How? focusing on live TV. This is our mission, our vision. If you are live, you are on Telemundo. Because for us, live TV is important for linear TV. It's a very important arm for us, with one condition, make the best content, the best content in news, in sports, in entertainment and in scripted.”


	Telemundo is also betting that it is a programming strategy that will engage younger audiences, or multigenerational families.


	“Live really isn't just a form of entertainment for our audience, it's a way for our audience to, in many ways, navigate through daily life. They feel connected. The way that we look at it is live is a culture connector. The real motivation for watching live is, quite frankly, spending time together and connecting,” says Mónica Gil, executive vp and chief administrative and marketing officer at NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises. “We also know that live programming is a favorite for younger audiences, and it's an audience, a demo, that everybody's trying to reach, and it bridges distances, even when we are geographically separated.”


	There's no better example than the World Cup, which will be held in 16 cities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico next year.


	According to Joaquin Duro, executive vp of sports at NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises, the network intends to bring the full Olympics treatment to the world cup, highlighting not only the athletes, but the locations.

	











	“It's an opportunity to to get closer to to our fans, to get closer to our communities, to tell the stories from location, and to tell the stories in our country,” Duro says. “We've covered many events, many World Cups and Olympics, and it's very nice when you have an Olympic Games in Paris or a World Cup in Russia or Doha, but you're telling stories from afar … [this is] the first time in many, many years that we have now the opportunity of covering an event, but telling the stories of our people, of our communities in our country. So that brings an additional emotional aspect, cultural aspect, and at the end of the day, a bigger connection. Then then ties into the sporting event.”


	And Telemundo sees the World Cup as an opportunity to reach a significantly wider audience. While Fox holds he English-language rights, the company noted that in the last World Cup in 2022, Telemundo had success in reaching a much broader slive of the demographics.


	“Over 30 percent of the consumption were non-Hispanics that came to Peacock to watch that, and then 30 percent of that audience was Spanish, but English dominant,” Duro says.


	It's all part of plan, articulated by Fernández, about leading Telemundo into an era where its sports, news and entertainment programming is fresh and relevant to consumers, wherever they opt to watch it. 


	“We need to prepare Telemundo for the for the future,” Fernández says. And going live is its big bet to keep that relevance high.

ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - Just 13 months away from the FIFA World Cup's arrival in Atlanta, the City of Decatur has announced a new festival for soccer fans.

Local leaders revealed plans for WatchFest ‘26 during an unveiling event on Tuesday morning in Decatur Square.

The free festival will run — while World Cup matches are underway —from June 11 until July 19, 2026. The 2026 tournament is projected to generate around $1 billion for the greater Atlanta area.

The newly renovated Decatur Square will debut during WatchFest ‘26 with a full slate of activities. This will include live music and games, along with an array of food and beverages.

Local businesses plan to broadcast every World Cup match, while the city anticipates screening select games on a large outdoor screen in the square.

Fans can also expect nightly pre and post-match concerts.

Decatur Mayor Patti Garrett says the festival is designed to attract locals while drawing in international visitors.

“Soccer is huge in Decatur, every single match will be shown,” she said. “That's a lot of soccer, 104 games featuring 48 teams.”

Atlanta will host eight World Cup matches at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, including one semifinal game.

Lorraine Cochran-Johnson, CEO of DeKalb County, noted that preparations extend well beyond Decatur.

“We're actually preparing all across DeKalb,” she said. “To host visitors, support events and ensure that the energy of this global celebration extends across every corner of our community.”

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the largest sporting event in metro Atlanta since the 1996 Olympic Games.

The World Cup will kick off just 400 days from Tuesday.

The Gunners' season will end if they fail to win at Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday and cast doubt over the future of this team's construction

From 2021 to 2024, Arsenal made significant progress with each passing season under Mikel Arteta. The Gunners' former captain has learnt a job on the fly, and after one-and-a-half seasons figuring out the kinks of management, he has become one of the world's leading coaches.

It's testament to the work Arteta's done that not only are Arsenal now consistently fighting for the game's most coveted prizes, but they are scolded and picked apart when they don't get their hands on silverware. They have missed out on the Premier League title again and head to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday looking to save their Champions League campaign. Luis Enrique's total-football side left the Emirates Stadium last week as 1-0 victors and have the upper hand heading into a second leg back on home soil.

Amid the disingenuous critiques of Arsenal, there are elements of fairer assessment. Though Arteta has essentially built this squad from scratch himself, should they have more than a solitary FA Cup - a team from which there are no longer any surviving starters - to boast about? Where did they take a left turn when they ought to have veered right on the path to glory?

Unless the Gunners pull off a remarkable comeback in the French capital, they will be under intense inspection again for going trophy-less once more. This meeting at Parc des Princes may have wider complications than first realised.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Spain international is still only 17 but there's arguably no more feared forward in the game today

Denzel Dumfries was outstanding for Inter in last week's Champions League clash with Barcelona, scoring two goals and creating another in an absorbing 3-3 draw. The Dutchman deserved his Player of the Match award - but he was by no means the star of the show. Lamine Yamal was the name on everyone's lips after another logic-defying display of quality from a 17-year-old that wowed the watching world.

""This guy is incredible,"" Manchester City striker Erling Haaland wrote on Snapchat. Bukayo Saka, meanwhile, struggled to find the words to describe Yamal: ""Honestly, doing what he is doing at his age, what can you say?... He's unreal. It's not normal. No one does that.""

And Saka's right: Yamal is unquestionably the finest teenage talent the game has ever seen. Nobody has ever been so good so young. Not Lionel Messi. Not Cristiano Ronaldo. And not even Pele.

Yamal lit up a Euro 2024 semi-final at 16. Now, he's taking the Champions League by storm.

Altitude was the story of the Mutua Madrid Open, as that event plays faster than most of the clay-court tournaments on the calendar. We saw several big servers win big matches in Spain. Well, we're back to sea level for this 1000-level event, meaning the conditions in Rome are gritty. So, get ready to put a little more weight into baseline play, and the ability to grind out long rallies.Last year, Tennis Abstract had Rome with a Surface Speed of 0.67, which means the Ace Rate at the tournament was 33% lower than that of a tour-average event. While having a great serve is always a good thing, it's not going to give players a massive leg up this week. You really have to have rally tolerance in Rome. If not, you better be striking the ball as clean as can be.

Jannik Sinner (+200): All eyes are on Sinner this week. The Italian hasn't lost a match this season—though he's only played seven, winning the Australian Open before serving his three-month suspension. Sinner is going to be extremely well rested coming, and one would think he has had quite a bit of time to work on his body and make any technical changes he saw fit. Tennis players usually aren't afforded three full months off, so there's a chance he'll be even more dangerous. But how will Sinner look without having played actual matches since January? On-court rust can get the better of anyone, even if it only manifests itself in the form of poor match conditioning.As far as the conditions go, I'm a big believer in Sinner's clay-court game. I know he hasn't yet had a big breakthrough on the dirt, but he looked like he was on his way to winning in Madrid before pulling out of the tournament with an injury last year. Overall, he's 54-24 on clay at the tour level.Sinner's ability to maneuver the baseline, blast the ball from both wings and serve and return at elite levels will make him a factor on any surface. And I strongly feel that the variety Sinner has added to his game will result in some huge clay results eventually. Adding a drop shot, improving his net game and mixing up the types of shots he hits in rallies will only make it harder for opponents to know what's coming. And all of that plays well in slower, grittier conditions.

Holger Rune (25-1): I'm at the point where I have no idea what to expect out of Rune. When he's healthy, he has the game to beat anyone—which is why I said he has the potential to win Grand Slam titles on Tennis Bets Live. In Barcelona, Rune beat Casper Ruud, Karen Khachanov and Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets in his final three matches to win the title. However, Rune then went to Madrid and retired after dropping the first set in his Round of 64 meeting with Flavio Cobolli. He has had a lot of trouble finishing matches all throughout the year.Is Rune healthy enough to compete in Rome? If so, his all-court ability will make him a tough out. And I happen to think he has a great path to the quarterfinals, as I'm not expecting Jack Draper to play very well after losing in the final in Spain.

Lorenzo Musetti (28-1): I'm not sure Musetti will actually win this tournament, but he has a pretty clear path to the quarterfinals. At that point, he'd likely face Arthur Fils, Stefanos Tsitsipas or Zverev—no easy match-ups. But Musetti is playing as well as anyone right now. He went all the way to the final in Monte-Carlo, then he followed it up with a run to the semifinals in Madrid. Well, why can't he take it a step further playing in front of a home crowd?The conditions in Rome are a bit more like Monte-Carlo, so Musetti is going to have time to load up with his one-handed backhand. And the high bounces are going to make it very difficult to get the ball by him. So, this should be Musetti at his very best. And at 28-1, it feels like this is worth a pizza-money play. When filling out a bracket for this tournament, I had Musetti facing Alcaraz in the semifinals. And while that went the Spaniard's way in Monte-Carlo, I'd like Musetti's chances against a banged-up Alcaraz in Rome. I also think the winner of this tournament will come from the bottom half of the draw, so if Musetti is in the final, then he just might win this.

Sinner agreed on a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency in February and began an immediate three-month suspension after authorities accepted that the anabolic agent clostebol had entered his system via massages from his physiotherapist.

The three-time Grand Slam champion, who has not played since winning the Australian Open in January, will now hope to leave the doping saga behind him and build momentum for the French Open, which runs from May 25th to June 8th.

The Italian was cleared to return to training from April 13th, with his suspension ending on May 4th.

""It's a very, very low expectation tournament in general for me, it's talking also results-wise,"" Sinner told reporters ahead of the Italian Open.

""What's missing is the complete feedback on where my level is. That's going to come then slowly with the time of playing, after the first round match, I'm going to have a good picture of myself - where I am at.""

Despite missing out on three months' action, the 23-year-old was assured of retaining the top ranking for his home tournament after his closest challenger, Alexander Zverev, crashed to an early defeat in the Monte-Carlo Masters.

""For me personally, good news that the Grand Slams were not included... This kind of agreement, I didn't want to do it in the beginning.

""It was not easy for me to accept it because I know what really happened, but sometimes we have to choose the best in a very bad moment,"" Sinner said.

""It's all over now, so I'm happy to play tennis again.""

Sinner said last year was very difficult for him.

""I was in a tough situation, and at the beginning of the Australian Open, I struggled a lot. So, it was nice also to take a small break,"" he added.

""But I could feel that I'm not playing for quite a long time. The body still has to adjust the times... the blisters in hands, they come again because you're not used to it anymore.""

Jannik Sinner is back on the ATP Tour, having served his three-month suspension in time to return at the Italian Open.

Sinner is the top seed at the 2025 Italian Open, having retained his world number one ranking despite his three-month ban.

Alexander Zverev and Carlos Alcaraz occupy second and third respectively in the ATP Tour rankings, with the duo also taking on the Italian Open.

All three players have been handed a bye in round one of the ATP Masters 1000 event, which takes place in Rome.

Jiri Lehecka was confirmed as Sinner's first practice partner at the tournament, but his preparations started previously with another ATP player.

Sinner trained with Jack Draper as part of his preparations, with the Italian now sharing his thoughts on the Briton for Sky Sports.

“He is a good friend of mine, also off the court,” Sinner said of Draper. “He has an incredible game. Great mentality.

“We all have been following for so long already and now he is coming through some incredible matches. One of the best players in the world right now. I was happy to share the court with him [in practice].

“Tried to understand where my level is, in the beginning things were not as perfect as I wanted to, which is normal. But after it went a little bit better, so I am happy about that. I am very happy for him.”

Draper has enjoyed a stunning rise in a short space of time, most recently reaching the final of the Madrid Open.

But the 23-year-old did lose out on the trophy to Casper Ruud, who won their entertaining clash 7-5, 3-6, 6-4.

Lehecka – Muller: Time TBA
H2H: 2-0

Jiri Lehecka has lost four of his last five matches. Last week in Madrid, Lehecka lost in the opening round against Norrie in three tight sets. His last and only appearance in Rome was in 2023, losing against Marozsan in the second round.

Alexandre Muller has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Madrid, the Frenchman lost against Tiafoe in the third round in straight sets. Last season in Rome, Muller reached the fourth round as a qualifier, eventually losing against Jarry in straight sets.

According to the bookies, Lehecka is the slight favourite in this matchup, and we agree. He struggled with his form recently but is still a solid player who can win against anyone. Lehecka easily won both head-to-head meetings against Muller in straight sets, and we expect a similar outcome this week.

That being said, Lehecka winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Jiri Lehecka winning @1.57 @bet365

Marozsan – Fonseca: Time TBA
H2H: first meeting

Fabian Marozsan has won three of his last five matches. His last match was in Madrid, where he lost against Cobolli in the opening round. Last season in Rome, the Hungarian lost against Shevchenko in the opening round. He has never made it past the fourth round in Rome.

Joao Fonseca has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Estoril, de Jong upset him in the opening round of the Challenger tournament. This will be his debut campaign in Rome. So far this season, Fonseca has already won one ATP title on clay in Buenos Aires earlier this season.

According to the bookies, Fonseca is the slight favourite in this matchup, and we agree. The young Brazilian is one of the most considerable talents on the tour. He enjoys playing in front of a packed crowd and handles the pressure well. Fonseca is a better player than Marozsan, and if he brings his A game, we expect him to win easily.

That being said, Fonseca winning in straight sets is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Joao Fonseca winning 2-0 @2.25 @bet365

Tien – Opelka: Time TBA
H2H: first meeting

Learner Tien has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Estoril, Tien lost against Elias in the opening round. Being American, Tien rarely played on clay. This will be his debut campaign in Rome.

Reilly Opelka has won three of his last five matches. Last week in Aix en Provence, Opelka reached the quarterfinals. He eventually retired mid-match against Buse. His last appearance in Rome was in 2022 when he lost in the opening round against Wawrinka.

According to the bookies, this will be a 50-50 matchup, but we disagree. Tien is an upcoming American star. Two years ago, he reached the semifinals at the Boys French Open. We believe he is a better clay-court player than Opelka.

That being said, Tien winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Learner Tien winning @1.80 @bet365

Alexander Zverev's season has been a mix of highs, lows and setbacks, but that won't stop him losing sight of his goals.

While the No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings has already scaled impressive heights in the sport, the hunger to reach the pinnacle burns brighter than ever. Zverev, who is defending champion at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome this week, was asked about his ongoing quest to reach World No. 1.

 “World No. 1? It would be nice, I have not been there. I believe I will, so we'll see how it goes,” Zverev said during Monday's press conference in Rome. “I'm there [No. 2] because I won tournaments. I'm there because I have results. The ranking system doesn't lie. You get points for winning matches, you get points for winning titles.”

Zverev has had the opportunity to surpass Jannik Sinner atop the rankings in 2025, while the Italian was completing a three-month period of ineligibility in a case resolution agreement with WADA. Yet, after reaching his third major final at the Australian Open, Zverev suffered a string of early exits before arriving in Munich.
The German admits that he felt the effects of a gruelling fortnight at the Australian Open, but bounced back with his first title of the season on home soil.
“I know I didn't play up to my standard,” Zverev said of his 6-6 record between the Australian Open and Munich, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. “I know I didn't play up to what I wanted to do. But neither did Carlos [Alcaraz], then he won Monte-Carlo.
“Do you think Novak [Djokovic] is happy with his results? Do you think Carlos is happy with his results? I'm not happy with my results. At the end of the day in big matches, big moments, I still believe the top players will rise, and I still believe that I am going to find my tennis for the biggest tournaments.”

Having won seven of his previous eight matches, Zverev appears to have found his form just at the right time ahead of the ATP Masters 1000 in Rome. Two of his 24 tour-level titles have come in the Italian capital (also 2017), but he will begin his title defence as No. 3 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, having dropped 1,000 points and in need of a strong week to maintain rhythm in the chase for World No. 1.
Zverev's run ended in the Madrid fourth round last week, when fell to his third consecutive defeat to Francisco Cerundolo. While the result may sting, the German was jovial when discussing it on Monday.
“I hate playing him, to be honest,” Zverev said with a smile. “I think outside of the top guys, like Jannik and Carlos, he's probably the most difficult for me to play. But all in all I thought my level of tennis was okay [in Madrid]. I thought I played three pretty good matches there. Also winning Munich the week before... I feel like my tennis is at the right spot right now.""

Emilio Nava will receive a main draw wild card into Roland Garros because the American won the USTA's Roland Garros Wild Card Challenge.

Nava was No. 238 in the PIF ATP Rankings in March, but has enjoyed a surge in form that has helped him return to the world's Top 150. The 23-year-old is closing on his career-high ranking of No. 137. 

The American won an ATP Challenger Tour event in Sarasota and reached a final in Tallahassee to win the Challenge and the accompanying wild card. He also won two clay-court Challenger crowns in March in South America.



Ethan Quinn finished second in the Challenge, followed by Colton Smith, Christopher Eubanks and Eliot Spizzirri. Americans who earned direct entry into Roland Garros, including those who entered with a protected ranking, were not eligible.

The USTA and FFT have a reciprocal agreement in which main draw wild cards for Roland Garros and US Open in 2025 will be exchanged. The USTA utilises this Challenge format to award wild cards into the Australian Open, Roland Garros and US Open.

Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer won final grand slam titles at the same age. The odds of beating that mark seem long, but the Serbian has always been ruthlessly determined

On a clear September New York evening in 1981, following a soul crushing loss to John McEnroe in the US Open final for the second consecutive year, Björn Borg disappeared into the night and vanished from the sport. He was only 25. He had accumulated an extraordinary 11 grand slam titles by then, but it left one to wonder how many more championships he could have amassed had he not retired so young. His conqueror that day had a much longer career and played until he was 33. But McEnroe, like Borg, won his last grand slam singles title at 25.

Back in those old days of the first phase of Open tennis (which I'll date from 1968-1985; most of the top pros didn't start playing the Australian Open regularly until the mid-1980s), players reached their peaks in their mid-20s and winning majors as one approached 30 was considered unusual.

Consider, when Jimmy Connors, the other figure of that bygone's era “big three” won Wimbledon and the US Open in 1982 it was roundly applauded as a brilliant end-of-career comeback. Connors played until he was 40. But his last grand slam victory was the 1983 US Open, when he was 31.

For most of the great men's champions of the last 60 years, their final title in a major was achieved around 30, if not earlier: Rod Laver (31), John Newcombe (31), Arthur Ashe (32), Ivan Lendl (29), Mats Wilander (24), Stefan Edberg (26), Boris Becker (28), Jim Courier (22), Pete Sampras (31), and Andre Agassi (32).

And the pattern holds true for the women as well. For the most prolific champions of the Open era, most women won their final grand slam singles title around the age of 30: Margaret Court notched her last slam at 31, a similar mark to Billie Jean King (31), Chris Evert (32), Martina Navratilova (33), Steffi Graf (29), Monica Seles (32), and Venus Williams (28).

And then there is Serena Williams. Like her Big Three contemporaries in the men's game, Serena set a new standard for winning after 30. Out of her 23 grand slam singles titles, 10 of those were won after 30 with her final coming at the age of 35 at the 2017 Australian Open. Serena also reached four additional finals after turning 35, her last being at the 2019 US Open just days before her 38th birthday.

There is one clear outlier – Ken Rosewall. The Australian, who straddled both the pre-Open and Open eras, won his final major title at the 1972 Australian Open at the age of 37 – and he is still the oldest winner of a grand slam singles title in the Open era.

All this is to say that what has transpired among Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic over the last seven years is paradigm-shifting. All three won consistently into their mid-30s, while still playing one another frequently.

How has this trio been able to reverse the aging process? For starters, they were (are, in Djokovic's case) just better than everyone else. Further, athletes' diet and conditioning regimens are far advanced from the days of McEnroe and Borg. And no tennis player, man or woman, has been as obsessed with maintaining his fitness level as Djokovic; from utilizing hyperbaric chambers to his gluten-free diet, Djokovic's strict routines have allowed him to thrive into his fourth decade. And this type of commitment has been seen across other sports and activities – from Tom Brady winning Super Bowls in his 40s to Phil Mickelson winning a major at 50 to Mick Jagger still projecting maximum physical energy on stage at the age of 80.

There's no question that tennis is a far more physical sport than it was a decade or two ago. As the serve-and-volley style nears extinction, there are more grueling, all-court points on all surfaces and most players now routinely slide even on hard courts. This makes it that much more amazing that an extra-physical player like Nadal was able to win a major at 36. Which is why, no matter what advances we'll continue to witness in sports science and nutrition, the mid-late 30s age may be a wall that's impossible to overcome.

Federer won four majors after the age of 30, his final triumph coming at the 2018 Australian Open at 36. Federer also came heartbreakingly close to winning Wimbledon in 2019 when he was nearly 38, but he couldn't convert either of two match points on his serve. Nadal upped the ante by winning an amazing eight slams after turning 30, with his last coming at the 2022 French Open at the age of 36.

And now tennis fans are witnessing what are surely the final stages – days, months, maybe a year? – of Djokovic's brilliant career. The Serb has claimed an almost unbelievable 12 grand slam titles since turning 30. But his last came at the 2023 US Open when he was … 36.

This establishes a wonderful – and somehow perfect – symmetry for Federer, Nadal and Djokovic. Forever linked with playing some of the most incandescent tennis the sport has ever witnessed while competing against each other, for the three to all finish their Slam dominance at 36 is fitting … unless, of course, Djokovic does something about it.

Djokovic has acknowledged his struggles over the last year and he admits that he's not used to being in the position of having difficulty winning consecutive matches. Although he does not believe he is done quite yet.

“Tennis is a sport where it's necessary to nurture that mentality of, ‘It's never enough'. Because once it's enough, then it's really enough and you have to put the racket aside,” he told Business Traveler this month. “And … I still don't feel it's enough for me.”

From this journalist's perspective it is highly doubtful that Novak can win another major. Having just pulled out of the crucial French Open tune-up event in Rome, Djokovic will head into Roland Garros with a paucity of clay court preparation. What makes matters worse is that his world rankings has dropped to No 6, putting him in the unenviable position of potentially having to play both Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner in Paris. The long, grueling red dirt battles would be a huge physical and mental burden.

Wimbledon is where Djokovic has the best chance to triumph. With the shorter points and being able to utilize his still-underrated stellar serve, Djokovic is most likely already planning to put in the fullest grass court prep possible and is probably doesn't expect to get much out of Roland Garros.

There is a general consensus among the most astute followers of the sport that Djokovic will have to pull out a near miracle to win other grand slam title. But there are those who firmly believe he can. Steve Flink, one of only seven journalists enshrined in the International Tennis Hall of Fame, is among them.

“While I understand why the skeptics are convinced that Djokovic as he closes in on the age of 38 is not going to win another major, I disagree,” Flink told me. “His sole purpose in continuing to compete after realizing all of his goals is to add another grand slam title to his collection, to garner No 25. He was not far away in Australia after beating Carlos Alcaraz to reach the semi-finals but his hamstring issue caused him to retire against Zverev. No doubt he has slumped since then and week in and week out he lacks his customary motivation but he will be primed for the three remaining grand slam tournaments this season. Djokovic has won two of the past four French Opens. He has been in every Wimbledon final since 2018 and has won the title there seven times. And he has taken the US Open title four times, appearing in 10 finals in New York.

“Last year many were doubting him after he was beaten soundly by Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final but he turned the tables … to win the Olympic gold medal in Paris. He often thrives when people are doubting him the most.”

One thing is certain – the more Djokovic hears about that he's finished or that he should walk away before it gets really ugly out there, the more he is motivated. It's a stance that Djokovic has perfected, having always been in the position of not being as openly loved as Federer and Nadal.

But if Djokovic doesn't win another Slam it'll just mean that the Big Three will be forever linked with winning their last at 36, yet another tie that binds the trio for eternity.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

MADRID – Casper Ruud was raised too well. Calm, thoughtful, friendly and humorous, the Norwegian is one of the players most deserving of moving from the ‘finalist' category to ‘champion' in a Grand Slam tournament.

He deserves it for his unusually good nature, yes, but also for his game. It was impressive to see him up close last Sunday in the Madrid final: Ruud plays with confidence, his forehand is very powerful and he is not afraid of close combat, as Britain's Jack Draper found out.

‘I'm particularly happy with the way I played the last game,' he admitted after beating Draper 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 in two hours and 29 minutes.

That's right, that final game was a distillation of the best Ruud, with a heavy forehand and the determination to go out and win a very evenly matched final. It was Ruud's first major title after six consecutive finals in major tournaments: three Grand Slams and three Masters 1000s.

How much of a favourite do you feel going into Roland Garros after this title? asked CLAY. Ruud, who is back in the top five in the world as of Monday, replied with thoughtful Nordic modesty.

‘There are still some really exciting weeks coming up, and I guess a win here shows the other players also that I'm here to try to do well for the rest of the clay season.'

But in another part of his post-final analysis, Ruud pointed out that the upcoming Roland Garros is the ‘most open in a long time,' both in the men's and women's competitions. Carlos Alcaraz is defending his title, but there are several challengers. Among them is Ruud, a two-time finalist in Paris.

‘If you look at my year this year, there's been one really good tournament, which was Dallas, where I reached a final, and other than that, it's been earlier losses than I hoped, more losses than I hoped,' Ruud said. 'But it's a long season, and I have tried to think about that. It's like a marathon, not a sprint, kind of like that saying.'

And who better than a marathon runner when it comes to winning Roland Garros?

Since her arrival on the WTA Tour Iga Swiatek has struggled on grass.

The Pole has yet to win a title on the surface and she has yet to find her st from at the Wimbledon Championships.

To further illustrate her difficulties on grass, Iga Swiatek has reached the quarter-finals at the All-England Club just once.

She usually enters the grass court season in imperious form on the clay, but so far that has not been the case for the World number two this season.

Swiatek suffered one of the worst defeats of her career at the recently concluded Madrid Open.

The 23-year-old lost 1-6, 1-6 to Coco Gauff in the semi-finals, bridging her title defence to an abrupt end.

Following that result, reports emerged that suggested Swiatek could skip the grass court season, including Wimbledon.

But according to a post on X by the Talking Tennis podcast on Tuesday, Swiatek has since confirmed that she will not skip Wimbledon and intends to play the grass court Grand Slam which commences on June 30.

Swiatek has played five times at Wimbledon throughout her career so far.

The former World number one has played 16 matches in total, and won 11, giving her a win percentage of 69%, her lowest at any of the Grand Slams.

Swiatek's overall grass court record consists of 24 wins and 10 defeats, and this percentage stands at 70.59%.

She will hope to change that when she takes to the hallowed grass courts at SW19, and if she does lift the Venus Rosewater dish, Swiatek will become the eighth woman to win a Grand Slam on hard, clay and grass courts.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Today is media day at the 2025 Italian Open (Internazionali BNL d'Italia). The ATP and WTA 1000 Masters event is the last big tournament before the clay court season culminates the second Grand Slam of the season at the French Open.

Naturally, the media was eager to speak with WTA World No. 2 Iga Swiatek. Despite having an overall strong season, Swiatek has not won any titles since last year's French Open.

Even worse, a Polish news outlet recently reported that Swiatek was considering skipping grass court season altogether to prepare for the US Open in August.

🗣️ “During the past few days, I saw like a million comments that were not true.”Iga Swiatek on recent rumors ⤵️ pic.twitter.com/U5p17wTXtF

Swiatek strongly refuted those reports when speaking with the press today. The five-time Grand Slam champion said people ""Shouldn't believe this stuff."" She added, ""During past few days I saw a million comments that were not true.""

Swiatek further explained, ""I don't get it. There are so many theories right now, I would say, especially in Polish media, about me that are not true. I think, I don't' know, you guys like to make some articles that will attract people. I get it. It's part of the job.

""But yeah, for sure, I'm not going to skip Wimbledon. I really want to learn how to play on grass better. Every year is another opportunity. I will play Wimbledon, for sure, unless I get injured.""

Swiatek is currently the WTA World No. 2 with a record of 26-8 on the season with zero titles. The Polish superstar's campaign at the Italian Open starts on Thursday, May 8.

Fans can mark their calendars for the French Open, which will start on May 25, and Wimbledon, which will begin June 30.

Iga Swiatek has dismissed rumours that she plans to skip this year's Wimbledon. The 23-year-old is preparing for the Italian Open and will then attempt to defend her French Open crown after winning the title in Paris for the last three years in a row.

Swiatek reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open in January but struggled for form during the Madrid Open last month. She eventually reached the last-four in Spain but was thrashed 6-1, 6-1 by Coco Gauff as the American took just over an hour to secure the victory. Swiatek admitted she needed a break in the aftermath of her loss to Gauff, with later reports suggesting she could give Wimbledon a miss.

Ahead of the Italian Open, Swiatek was asked whether she plans to skip Wimbledon. And she replied: “Shouldn't believe this stuff.”

She added: “During the past few days I saw a million comments that were not true. I don't get it. There are so many theories right now I would say, especially in the Polish media about me that are not true.

“I don't know, you guys like to make some articles that will attract people. I get it, it's part of your job. But yeah, for sure, I'm not going to skip Wimbledon.

Swiatek has never gone beyond the quarter-finals at Wimbledon and was knocked out at the third round stage by Yulia Putintseva at last year's edition of the tournament.

The previous season, she was defeated by Elina Svitolina in the last-eight after succumbing to Alize Cornet in the third round back in 2022.

Despite her struggles on grass, Swiatek is a five-time Grand Slam champion, with four of those titles coming at the French Open. She claimed her first Major away from Roland Garros in 2022 when she defeated Ons Jabeur in the US Open final and is also a two-time semi-finalist at the Australian Open.

“So I wasn't really sure what I have in my tool box. But yeah, for sure, I didn't even have a plan B because nothing was working today.

“I didn't play well even on these matches that I won. I think I pushed kind of with my head for more than I even should, tennis-wise.”

Iga Swiatek says she has already made up her mind about competing at Wimbledon this year while she also took aim at the “million comments that were not true”.

On the back of her semi-final exit from the Madrid Open, it was reported that the five-time Grand Slam winner considered skipping the entire grass-court season, including Wimbledon, in order to be fresh for the North American hard-court swing.

Polish website Onet claimed: “As we hear unofficially, everything will depend on the results in Rome and Paris

“In the event of a defeat, Swiatek may consider giving up playing on grass, there are not many points to lose here, and use this time for a longer vacation, to return to hard courts with new strength and properly prepare for the US Open.

“But Team Swiatek will wait until the very end with this decision.”

But Swiatek has dismissed suggestion she will not play at Wimbledon.

Here is her full exchange with journalists during her Italian Open press conference.

Q. I'm not sure if it's correct, but I read are you considering to skip Wimbledon?

IGA SWIATEK: Who said that?

Q. I just read that on social media, so I wanted to clarify.

IGA SWIATEK: “Shouldn't believe this stuff.”

Q. It's off the charts?

IGA SWIATEK: “Yes.”

Q. I already saw a comment of Brad Gilbert slightly criticising that.

IGA SWIATEK: “During past few days I saw a million comments that were not true.”

Q. How do you handle it?

IGA SWIATEK: “I don't get it. There are so many theories right now I would say especially in Polish media about me that are not true. I think, I don't know, you guys like to make some articles that will attract people. I get it. It's part of the job.

Iga Swiatek: Time to stop the hate flowing in the direction of a champion who deserves better

Although Swiatek has reached the quarter-final or better in her eight tournaments so far this year, she is yet to win or title.

One thing she believes is currently holding her back is her perfectionism.

“I have love-and-hate relationship with my perfectionism. Yeah, like coming on these clay court tournaments, I just kind of try to reflect on how I see my game and how I also saw previous seasons,” she said.

“The thing is that I only remember the good stuff from last years because I was winning titles and everything. My head kind of remembers the good stuff.

“Sometimes I'm on court, I feel like I'm going to play this loopy forehand there, my great backhand there. I'm making decisions that are not really good at the moment because I just remember how it felt previous tournaments or previous years. I kind of assume it's going to go in, and then I make mistakes. It's not the same, I'm confused.

“As I said, that's why every tournament and every year is different. There's no reason to compare because we are, like, at different places in our lives, as well.

“That's why I'm happy that I have my team around me to also help me to manage this stuff. Without them, for sure it wouldn't be so easy.”

ROME — Nearly 50 American tennis players will descend on Rome this week for the Italian Open, the signature tournament for a country whose recent success in developing talent has become an inspiration for the rest of the world — especially the U.S..

Italian tennis has been punching far above its weight lately, producing the country's first world No. 1 in Jannik Sinner and a bevy of young talent, despite operating with far less money and less than 20 percent of America's population. So when the U.S. Tennis Association (USTA) embarked on a reorganization of its player development system, its leaders put the Italian Tennis Federation (FITP) under a microscope to try to figure out the ingredients and recipe for their secret sauce.

Advertisement

Everyone in the sport watched the past 10 years as Italy added a slew of lower-level professional tournaments, giving its players far more local opportunities to compete without frittering money and time on travel. It built more hard courts to prepare its talents for a circuit that plays on them more than any other surface. It decentralized its high-performance structure, to improve coaching continuity as talented juniors become talented adult professionals. It has reaped the rewards: there are nine Italians in the ATP top 100 and three in the WTA top 100, two in the men's top 10 and one in the women's.

“They heavily go strong on sports science support between 15, 16, and 17,” Tracy Davies, a longtime USTA executive who recently became the general manager of USA Tennis, the organization's newly created high-performance division, said in an interview.

“They're making sure the kids have the best in athletic development, making sure they have the best mental training, that they have all the data they need every single match they play.”

Italy's rewards have even extended to adding a top American talent to its ranks. Tyra Grant, a rising figure in the women's game with an American father and Italian mother, in April decided to switch to il tricolore. Grant, 17, was born and raised in Italy, but had spent significant time in the U.S. through her childhood and much of the past 18 months of her professional development using the national USTA campus in Orlando, Fla. as her home base.

During a roundtable in Rome, Grant said that she switched because she had more of an affinity with Italy.

“I feel mostly Italian. Even though I'm half and half, I think I'm more connected to the Italian part,” she said at the Foro Italico.

“I was born here and I grew up here and my friends are here. I feel more connected to the Italian culture and feel more home here.”

Nearly 20 years ago, when a golden generation of Spanish players dominated the top of men's tennis, the United States Tennis Association built a player development system based on the Spanish machine.

Now the U.S. wants to be Italy.

The U.S. player development program has not exactly been a flop. Since 2008, the last time the organization restructured, it has produced 23 junior Grand Slam champions, but winning adult titles is the real measure of success. American women have been winning Grand Slam titles for decades, and while Andy Roddick's 2003 U.S. Open remains the most recent on the men's side, the U.S. has achieved the kind of depth at the top of the ATP Tour that it hadn't seen since the 1990s.

There are four American women in the WTA top 10 and four American men in the ATP top 16. Madison Keys won the Australian Open just this year; Taylor Fritz and Jessica Pegula reached the U.S. Open singles finals in 2024. But for years now on the men's side, only unicorns with the rarest of innate tennis gifts have been reaching that lofty plateau of Grand Slam champion. Keys was touted as a multiple-major winner before she was 18. She proved to be an overnight success story 16 years in the making.

The question now is whether Davies and her team at the USTA can incorporate the Italian formula for success into the sprawling organism of American tennis. Lew Sherr, who became USTA chief executive three years ago, had not planned on restructuring a player development program that had enjoyed significant success. When the Covid-19 pandemic brought a few lean years to the world's most profitable tennis federation, Sherr focused on maintaining, and then growing participation as opposed to elite performance coaching. The USTA cut funding for camp programs and reduced the number of national team coaches from 24 to 11.

Then the man who orchestrated much of that successful player development program during the past 15 years decided to weigh in.

Jose Higueras, who coached Jim Courier and Roger Federer at their pinnacles, led the player development program at the USTA from 2008 to 2014 and served as a consultant for several years after that. He watched with a combination of fear and anger as the organization cut back on elite coaching and training for rising juniors.

In March of last year, he circulated a letter to leaders in the American tennis community.

“The current leadership has veered off course, deliberately cutting funding and staffing for the Team USA pathway and American players, while they waste millions of dollars on boondoggles like unnecessary building renovations at the USTA Campus in Lake Nona and a million-dollar holiday party.

“If the decisions of the past four years are not reversed soon, in ten years, American Tennis will be irrelevant on the world stage,” Higueras wrote.

Brian Vahaly, a former professional who took over as president of the USTA in January, said in an interview in April that creating a new generation of stars and growing participation are not mutually exclusive missions.

“American success is incredibly important to us getting there,” Vahaly said.

Stars, he said, make television ratings spike and inspire kids to play, just as he was inspired as a child by meeting Michael Chang. This is the phenomenon that Italy is seeing with Sinner, who has become the male sporting icon in a country that, for so many years, was one of the most dominant soccer nations in the world. As that dominance has waned and Italian tennis has risen, Sinner has become its celebrity. Children see him and want to be him.

“We are seeing tremendous demand in our sport and that's coinciding at a time when we have a really large amount of top 100 players that are Americans,” Vahaly said. “It's a key driver.”

Sherr said that after reading Higueras' letter, he made a decision to be “much more directly involved with our player development efforts and organization.” He came to realize that each high-performance division — from strength and conditioning, to data analysis, to tournament organization — had its own budget and had to advocate for itself. Everything was siloed. There was no unifying force or strategy.

Davies, a former player for the University of Tennessee, has the job of being that unifier. USA Tennis now includes everything from player development to junior competitions, international team events and managing all professional tournaments other than the U.S. Open — all with one eye across the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean.

“You look to learn from countries like Italy and others that are finding success,” said Vahaly.

“We'd be crazy not to learn from other countries and what they're doing really well.”

At the top of the list was adding more second- and third-tier tournaments, as the Italians had done. The U.S. will host 130 such events this year. Last year there were about 110 but many were — and still are — at the lower end on the International Tennis Federation (ITF) circuit. Those events are useful for the most elite juniors, like 17-year-old American Iva Jovic, who won her first title on that circuit when she was 14 and has since won main-draw matches at Grand Slams.

But it's the ATP Challenger and WTA 125 circuits, which are the second tiers of professional tennis, that truly mould players. At the highest level, more and more ATP and WTA 1,000 events (one rung below a Grand Slam) now run for a fortnight. That leaves a lot of losers hanging around with a week or more to kill, and a good deal of them enter Challenger and WTA 125 events to get some reps.

Four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka played a WTA 125 event in France in early May. In the same week the Estoril Open in Portugal, which is in the highest ATP Challenger tier, had several top-30 players in the draw. Being able to get that kind of experience on home soil, without the costs of international travel and accommodation, is invaluable to rising players.

The USTA, which provides about $10 million in subsidies at these professional events, mostly for prize money, is pushing to add more events at the higher end of those tiers, targeting as much as an annual 30 percent increase. Tournaments with more prize money and points are more attractive to better competition; investing in domestic events may be a more efficient use of money than paying for a handful of top players and coaches to travel to Europe for tournaments. Davies wants to do a better job of scheduling the events and clustering them geographically to make them more accessible to more players.

Same goes for elite junior events. The U.S. is home to some 14,000 junior tournaments, more than any other country. Davies said she leans regularly on the advice of the captains of the Billie Jean King and Davis Cup teams, Lindsay Davenport and Bob Bryan. Both won their share of Grand Slam titles and gold medals and reached No. 1 in their world rankings.

Both also have talented tennis-playing children. Davenport's son, Jagger Leach, won the boys' singles title at Indian Wells in March and plans to attend Texas Christian University, the program that nurtured British players Cameron Norrie and Jacob Fearnley.

Leach had a rather rarefied tennis childhood, with a mother who is a former world No. 1 and a father who was an All-American at the University of Southern California. Still, Davenport told Davies that her son might have benefitted from having more consistent coaching in USTA programs. Like most tennis federations, the USTA generally has coaches who work with younger players, and then others who take them on as they progress through their teenage years.

Italy went the other way, introducing a network of regional performance centers to offer local resource while keeping players in the same environment, and with the same coaches, for as long as possible. Sinner's formative years were not in an FITP center, but at a private academy, the Piatti Tennis Center in Bordighera. The FITP instead focused on infrastructure at the national level, from data to sports psychology, just as the USTA'S USA Tennis initiative intends to do now.

The organization has Larry Lauer, a longtime sports psychologist, leading its mental skills department. Lauer often speaks to developing players and parents at national and regional camps and through webinars.

Players have been hiring their own mental performance coaches at younger ages, but there are a lot of talented players at the lower end of the income scale who can't afford that. Davies said that's a solvable problem, in addition to building awareness and access to mental health professionals who have nothing to do with sports psychology or high performance.

“Just going back and continuing to remind ourselves, it's not about me, you know, or anyone, or what their past results are playing,” Davies said. “It's really about the players and where they are now and what we can do to support them.”

If there is an irony in all this, it's that one of Italy's most important innovations is right in the U.S. tennis wheelhouse. Its hard-court drive produced the male success story that predates Sinner: Matteo Berrettini, who reached the Wimbledon final in 2021 and has the booming serve and forehand of the male American tennis archetype. Sinner has followed him and transfigured men's tennis into a game of attack or be attacked from anywhere in the court, alongside Carlos Alcaraz, his biggest rival.

But in that fallow period for male American Grand Slam champions since Roddick, clay-court skills — use of angles over linear ballstriking, variety, lateral movement and rally tolerance — defined the evolution in men's tennis. Italy's hard-court boom may yet create a best-of-both worlds training environment, but the U.S. tennis landscape is yet to embrace a similar hybridity.

The USTA doesn't have to lift a finger to get players hard-court experience, since those courts dominate American tennis. The clay experience, specifically the red clay experience, which they know from experience can be so helpful, is always a work in progress, because there just isn't all that much of it in America. The better players can find it at the Orlando training center and other select locations. Many others have to use green clay as a substitute. It's not a great one, since sliding and ball movement is different on that surface, but it's something, and it's prevalent, especially in Florida.

Higueras, who lives on a ranch in Palm Springs, Calif., said he wasn't consulted on any of the changes. Reached last week and informed that the letter had caused Sherr to focus more heavily on player development, Higueras was magnanimous.

“I wish them all the best,” he said.

It sometimes feels as though ever since the 2021 US Open, Emma Raducanu has been trying to recapture the spirit of that schoolgirl who swept to the title. Perhaps it should come as no surprise, then, that the 22-year-old version of that kid has a yearning to dust off her textbooks.

‘I'm going to start studying more,' says Raducanu, in a joint interview with Mail Sport and the Guardian at the Italian Open. ‘I think I need that. I've missed it for the last few years. I need something to stimulate and engage my brain so my entire life isn't just tennis.'

Will this be formal study? ‘I haven't decided yet. I think so. Whether I take my third A level, whether I go into a degree, I feel like I need some sort of pressure and adrenaline in that area of my life.

‘Growing up, I always had tennis as an escape from studying and studying as an escape from tennis. So it wasn't just my entire life, my entire personality dependent on this one thing.

‘I loved studying and I still do. I love those moments on my own, quiet reading in the library, figuring things out myself.

‘In this life, where it's so busy and there's so many people around, as you see (she gestures around the buzzing terrace of the Foro Italico) it's nice to have that little retreat.

‘Solving problems, getting a certain grade on an exam… your self esteem isn't just reliant on a win or a loss.'

What would that third A Level be (to go with maths and economics)? Raducanu considers. ‘English, politics or physics,' she says.

The subject arose from a question about Carlos Alcaraz's new documentary. The Spaniard said his greatest fear is for tennis to become an obligation - has the sport ever felt like that for Raducanu since her title in New York?

‘Yeah, I would say there have been times I felt that,' she says. ‘The last few years of my career have been a big, big learning curve.

‘I don't have all the answers now but I feel like I'm starting fresh. I want to do things in a different way. I'm working to see what I can do to bridge the gap between where I am now and the top of the game.

‘I'm working on a few things, in my game and off the court, setting up my life in different ways.'

It is no wonder Raducanu, a naturally curious and introspective soul, has been thinking things over recently.

A lot has happened this year. A back spasm which ruined her pre-season. The departure of trusted coach Nick Cavaday for health reasons. The terror of being stalked across four countries. A coaching trial with Vlado Platenik which ended after just two weeks.

The upshot of that abrupt parting from Platenik in Miami was an on-the-hoof partnership with Mark Petchey.

What began as a stop-gap has become a more permanent, if informal, arrangement, and Raducanu talks for the first time about how that alliance came about.

‘It happened completely by chance,' she says. ‘It was almost fate. I was working with Vlado and I just knew it had to come to an end. Mark was already in Miami, commentating, and I bumped into him in one of the corridors. He's someone that I trust so we were just talking. It was a bit of both: it was me being scared to ask, can you help? And it was him not wanting to push himself.'

Once again, Raducanu has reverted to someone who has known her before her Grand Slam triumph. Also in Rome is Jane O'Donoghue, her childhood coach turned financier. Raducanu reveals that O'Donoghue has taken a couple of months off her job in the city to be here for the clay court swing and into the grass. She has previously only done a week here and there.

Raducanu knows her own mind and is fiercely loyal to those who knew her before fame and fortune.

‘I am very independent and that definitely comes from my mum,' she says. ‘She's the strongest person I know, has gone through so much in life and she's always taught me to rely on people as little as possible.

‘But sometimes you do need to lean on people. I have become less afraid to do that.

‘It takes a lot for me to open up. I haven't truly opened up to many people in my life.

‘Once I let someone in, I let them in fully, and I care for them so much. I have been burned a few times, a few people who I've really trusted have surprised me.

‘It's very difficult for me to trust new people. I find myself gravitating towards those people I've known before the US Open. My circle is smaller than ever.

‘Up until I won the US Open, I was so sheltered. Up to 18, I was just with my parents. It was like nothing could touch me. And then all of a sudden everyone came and I got burned quite a lot of times, whether that's professionally or personally. Now I'm very Fort Knox with who I let in.'

Raducanu's path of self discovery continues as she grows up under the beam of a most intent spotlight. She begins her Italian Open campaign on Wednesday against a qualifier.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","tennis"

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner is officially back on the professional tennis tour. The Italian missed the last three months due to a doping suspension as part of his agreement with WADA. However, the World No. 1 is in the news in more ways than one. Outside of his doping suspension, rumors are flying around about his relationship status.

In the build-up to the upcoming Rome Masters, Sinner was spotted multiple times with Russian model Lara Lieto. This triggered a social media meltdown with everyone claiming that Sinner may have a new partner in his life. However, now, in the tournament's press conference, the Italian has opened up on the matter.

Sinner claimed the news linking him to a new relationship status was fake. He said that he wants to stay focused on tennis as he returns to the sport after three months. The World No .1 said in the pre-tournament press conference at the Italian Open, “Off the court, I was very surprised to see some pictures… nothing, nothing, nothing serious. I'm not in a relationship.”

Jannik Sinner confirms he's not in a relationship:

— The Tennis Letter (@TheTennisLetter) May 5, 2025

Sinner was previously in a relationship with tennis star Anna Kalinskaya. The duo were seen together multiple times in the back end of the 2024 season. The biggest moment came when Sinner won the US Open title and Kalinskaya came to see the match against Taylor Fritz. The duo were seen having a kiss after the final and took multiple pictures with the US Open trophy.

However, in the past few months, Sinner and Kalinskaya have not interacted. Neither has been following the other on their Instagram accounts. It should be noted that Kalinskaya was also in a relationship with Australian tennis star Nick Kyrgios in 2020.

Sinner has disclosed that he is not in a relationship with Lieto. However, the World No. 1 has not spoken about his relationship status with Kalinskaya. It just adds to the fact that the Italian had plenty of problems outside of the court in his rise to the World No. 1 in the ATP rankings. With his doping scandal and the WADA agreement behind him, he wants to stay focused on his game and take on the best players in the world at the Italian Open. The build-up to Roland Garros has officially started.

                  Zverev, who is still seeking his first Grand Slam title, said he should in retrospect have taken time off after losing to Jannik Sinner in straight sets in the Australian Open final at the end of January.

Defending Rome Open champion Alexander Zverev said he is now on a “good path”, putting a poor run of form following his defeat in the Australian Open final down to burn-out.

The 28-year-old world number two put an end to the dry run -- which included opening round defeats in Indian Wells and Monte Carlo -- by winning the ATP title in Munich in mid-April.

The German, who is still seeking his first Grand Slam title, said he should in retrospect have taken time off after losing to Jannik Sinner in straight sets in the Australian Open final at the end of January.

“Before Munich obviously my level of play wasn't great,” he said at Tuesday's press conference. “There are reasons for it. I think not taking time off after Australia was a big reason for it. I felt like I burned out a little bit.”

Zverev said the life of a professional tennis player was an incessant cycle of travelling and playing without any time to rest.

“We play a lot. We travel a lot. First of all, we don't give our bodies rest, but we also don't give our heads rest. They don't get mental rest. I needed that a little bit,” he said.

“I'm on a good path. I won a tournament two weeks ago. I cannot forget that. And I have to focus on the positives.”

Zverev, though, said he believed one day he would be world number one and lashed out at the media for belittling him when he was enduring the bad run.

He said he was not the only one who had been struggling lately with former number ones and multiple Grand Slam champions Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz also enduring some tough times.

“I do think the media also loves to put players down, right?” he said. “I had a bad two months before Munich, right?

“I didn't play great tennis before Munich. All of a sudden I'm like the worst world No. 2 ever. I don't deserve to be there.

“I'm there because I won tournaments. I'm there because I have results.”

Zverev is hoping a good title defence in Rome will set him up to go one better than last year at the French Open and be crowned champion.

“At the end of the day in big matches, big moments, I still believe the top players will rise,” he said. “I still believe that I am going to find my tennis for the biggest tournaments.”

Alex de Minaur has landed on the same side of the draw as Jannik Sinner at the Italian Open, and could face the World No.1 in the semi-finals in his return to tennis. Sinner is back in action in Rome this week after a three-month suspension for inadvertently ingesting a banned substance.

He received a hero's welcome by his home fans when he hit the court for a practice session on Sunday, with spectators flocking to get a glimpse of the four-time grand slam champion. Sinner's ban has ended right in time for a return at home in Italy - a detail that many believe isn't a coincidence.

The World No.1 has been handed a first-round bye as the top seed, and will face the winner of Mariano Navone and local wildcard Federico Cina in the second. Aussie star de Minaur is on the same side of the draw as Sinner, and the pair are slated to face off in the semis if they both make it that far.

It might present de Minaur the perfect opportunity to grab a first career win over Sinner, with their head-to-head record currently 10-0 in the Italian's favour. Clay isn't Sinner's favourite surface, and if he shows any signs of rust it might open the door for de Minaur.

The Aussie has risen to World No.8 in recent weeks after making the semi-finals in Monte Carlo, quarters in Barcelona and fourth round in Madrid. He's certainly got more match practice under his belt than Sinner, who has had the wood over the Aussie their whole careers.

De Minaur has only ever won the solitary set against Sinner, but that came way back in 2020. Most recently he was thrashed by the World No.1 in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open in January.

Speaking to the media on Monday, Sinner moved to lower expectations about how he'll perform in his first tournament for three months. And in extraordinary scenes, he even moved to address recent speculation about his love life.

Sinner was spotted with Russian model Lara Leito by the paparazzi recently, but said in Rome: “There's a lot of attention. Also, off the court, I was surprised to see some pictures, which, nothing serious. I'm not in a relationship.”

Sinner previously dated Russian tennis player Anna Kalinskaya, but they ended their relationship last year. He was seen walking alongside Leito in Monte Carlo last month, and the model also attended the Monte Carlo Masters event where Sinner was practicing.

Addressing his return and the difficult period surrounding his positive tests, the 23-year-old said: ""Last year was very difficult. I had a lot of personal pressure, holding everything. I couldn't talk with many people about what happened.

""I was in a tough situation at the beginning of the Australian Open. I struggled a lot, so it was nice to take a small break. Three months, but it is what it is. A small break was good. I could feel that I'm not playing for quite a long time.

“What's missing for me is the complete feedback of where my level is. That's going to come slowly with time of playing. After the first-round match, I'm going to have a good picture of myself and where I'm at.""

WTA Staff


ROME -- After scoring the first win of her comeback at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, Petra Kvitova was relieved -- and a little confused.

""It's kind of weird that my first one came here,"" she said after defeating Irina-Camelia Begu 7-5, 6-1.

""I've never played my best tennis here. But it feels much better than losing, that's for sure.""

The last time Kvitova had won consecutive matches in Rome was a decade ago, when she reached the 2015 quarterfinals.

Rome: Draws | Scores | Order of play | Tournament info

The former World No. 2 had gone 0-4 in the first four tournaments of her return, falling to Jodie Burrage in Austin, Varvara Gracheva in Indian Wells, Sofia Kenin in Miami and Katie Volynets in Madrid -- a run of results that makes her grimace. But despite the losses, Kvitova's comeback has been underpinned by a joy that surprised even her.

""I was 95% that I would never come back,"" she said, recalling the last tournament before her maternity leave -- Beijing in 2023. ""I had enough of tennis at that time. I was like, 'I can't do it any more,' so we decided to try for a baby. I didn't say anything because it wasn't 100%.""

After her son, Petr, was born in July last year, the 5% of doubt grew. Kvitova had been frustrated at being unable to be active during her pregnancy, so she was eager to pick up a racquet again.

""When I could do something finally after pregnancy, I played some tennis -- and it felt so good,"" she said. ""I was laughing. Every shot I hit smoothly, I was like, 'Wowwww -- it's still there.' It's not in the legs -- but in the hands, it's sometimes very good.""

That was evident against Begu, during which Kvitova dropped serve just once. That came in her first attempt at serving the first set out at 5-4. She responded by rattling off eight of the last nine games. Among her highlights was a spectacular backhand down the line, struck after a desperate, scrambling lob.

""I'm not as fit as I wanted to be, for sure,"" she said. ""But even in practices my game was going up.""

While the shot-making still brings Kvitova joy, she sighs deeply when talking about everything else that comes with being a professional player.

""You have to train every day, you have to fight, you have to travel,"" she said, a gloomy tone entering her voice. ""That's all the things that are not my favorites ... Practicing and gym and recovery stuff. I was like, 'Oh my god, really, this again?'""

Hotel rooms also seem suddenly small, now that Petr is beginning to crawl ""everywhere"" and sleeping less. Kvitova and Jiri Vanek, her husband and coach, now prefer to rent apartments, where their son has room to play with toys and where they feel at home. But for now, the on-court joy outweighs the grunt-work. Kvitova refuses to set any goals or impose any sort of time limit on this stage of her career.

""However long I'm going to enjoy it,"" she said.

Kvitova will next face No. 27 seed Ons Jabeur in the second round. She leads their overall head-to-head 4-2, though this will mark their first meeting on clay.

ROME, Italy—Alexandra Eala has quickly become one of the most recognizable faces in tennis, and the fans at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia have taken notice of the teen phenom in her debut appearance.“I didn't expect such a big Filipino population here in Rome,” said the 19-year-old, who will play her first round against Marta Kostyuk on Wednesday. “But even just walking the streets, I've run into Filipinos five times already. When we walk in the streets, you know when you're seeing another Filipino!“It's such a blessing, of course, to have such a big community. So many places feel like home because of that.”

The Filipino fans came out in full force for Eala's breakthrough Miami Open run, where she reached the quarterfinals with victories over Jelena Ostapenko and Iga Swiatek. Facing off again last month at the Mutua Madrid Open, the Quezon City native led Swiatek by a set and a break, ultimately falling in three sets.“I think, personally, I definitely prefer hard courts,” Eala told Tennis Channel on Monday. “That's the surface I grew up on, although I've been spending time on clay from, obviously everything. From the junior tour you play a lot on clay, and now on the pro tour has its clay season. I like to think I'm comfortable on both, but still more comfortable with hard courts.”The Rafael Nadal Academy alum has definitely spent plenty of time on clay, and looks to slide into her first clay swing by drawing inspiration from her idols.

ROME, Italy—Casper Ruud described sports psychology as “personal training for your feelings” in a quick-hit interview ahead of his return to the Internazionali BNL d'Italia.“When you talk to someone, whether it's a psychologist, psychiatrist or anyone, I think it helps like a kind of personal training for your brain,” Ruud told Tennis Channel on Tuesday. “You get personal training in the gym to work on your glutes or your arms, but I think talking to someone in this aspect is like personal training for your feelings.“It was really nice and I had a great experience with it.

Ruud has endured his share of ups and downs since reaching his first Grand Slam final at 2022 Roland Garros.

Lisa, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Walton Goggins and Aimee Lou Wood hit up fashion's biggest night despite the nerves caused by such a major red carpet event: “I'm terrified.” 


							By 

	Chris Gardner



	From one cultural phenomenon to another.


	A handful of stars from HBO's The White Lotus made a splash on Monday night by stepping out at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art to attend the Met Gala. Lisa, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Walton Goggins and Aimee Lou Wood were among the high-profile Hollywood stars invited to fashion's biggest night. 




	“I'm terrified because it's my first Met,” Wood told Vogue live stream co-hosts Teyana Taylor and Ego Nwodim while standing alongside Schwarzenegger, who is practically a Met Gala vet at this point. Goggins also attended the Met for his first time, an event that comes just days ahead of his outing as host of Saturday Night Live. Meanwhile, Lisa proved to be in good company by attending the Met Gala on the same night as her Blackpink colleagues Rosé and Jennie.

	The Met Gala serves as the Metropolitan Museum of Art's annual marquee fundraiser. This year's installment celebrates the Costume Institute's spring fashion exhibition, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” which draws inspiration from Monica L. Miller's 2009 book Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity. The evening's theme, given to guests and stylists as a way to interpret the dress code, was “Tailored for you.” Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky and Pharrell Williams are the 2025 co-chairs alongside Vogue's Anna Wintour and honorary chair LeBron James (who pulled out last minute, citing a knee injury).

The ‘Midnight Cowboy' and ‘Heat' actor — also a “special ambassador” to the entertainment industry for the White House — presented a plan to return more production to U.S. shores after meeting with industry stakeholders.



		By Katie Kilkenny, Alex Weprin 

	May 5, 2025 2:31pm	




	One of President Donald Trump's “special ambassadors” to Hollywood has spoken — and has a plan to bring more production back to the U.S., or so he says.


	After a period of silence on his role as a liaison between the entertainment industry and the White House, actor Jon Voight on Monday revealed his intentions for resolving so-called runaway production, or film and television productions fleeing the U.S. for more cost-effective shores.




	That plan involves a combination of federal tax incentives, tax code changes, co-production treaties and infrastructure subsidies for theater owners, production and postproduction companies, according to a press release sent Monday by a representative for Voight and his business partner Steven Paul.

					""Everyone Loses"": Trump's Movie Tariffs Plan Catches Hollywood Off Guard		
			









	The release made only brief mention of tariffs, which Trump in a Sunday social media post said he would apply to productions produced outside the U.S. Voight's plan involves “tariffs in certain limited circumstances,” the release stated.


	“The President loves the entertainment business and this country, and he will help us make Hollywood great again,” said Voight.


	The Midnight Cowboy and Heat actor added, “We look forward to working with the administration, the unions, studios, and streamers to help form a plan to keep our industry healthy and bring more productions back to America.”


	The plan is the result of months of meetings between Voight and his team and entertainment stakeholders, such as studios, streamers, unions and guilds. Voight and Paul confirmed that they met with Trump at Mar-A-Lago over the weekend, and the White House is “reviewing” their proposals.


	The details from Voight come after a tumultuous 24 hours in which Trump announced a 100 percent tariff on films produced outside the U.S., before the White House walked that back a bit Monday morning, telling The Hollywood Reporter in a statement that “although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again.”


	The news caught Hollywood off guard, and brought with it more questions than answers about how it would work and what would be subject to tariffs (let alone questions of legality). Hollywood unions, not surprisingly, seemed open to the idea of government intervention, though SAG-AFTRA and the Teamsters had very different levels of enthusiasm when it came to tariffs in particular.

	











	There may actually be bipartisan support for Voight and Paul's proposal.


	In a statement of his own Monday, Sen. Adam Schiff said that he was in favor of incentives to bring back filmmaking, although he pushed back on the idea of blanket tariffs: “I share the administration's desire to bring movie making back to the United States,” Schiff said. “While blanket tariffs on all films would have unintended and potentially damaging impacts, we have an opportunity to work together to pass a major federal film tax credit to re-shore American jobs in the industry. I welcome the opportunity to work with the administration and my Republican colleagues to pass a globally competitive federal film incentive to bring back run-away production.”


	Schiff has been discussing the possibility of a federal tax incentive with unions for some time.


	Later on Monday, Voight released a video where he discussed his proposal to Trump. In the video, the actor said Trump “loves the entertainment industry business and wants to see Hollywood thrive and make films bigger and greater than ever before, as he says.” Trump also wants to see “productions come back to America and Hollywood,” Voight said.

From theatrical trains to ultra-wide shoulders, this year's (relatively few) truly compelling red-carpet outfits were the bolder interpretations of the Black dandyism theme.


							By 

	Lovia Gyarkye


Arts & Culture Critic


	Moments before the Met Gala was set to begin, I confessed to a friend, with whom I'd been texting, that I was a little stressed about what celebrities would wear this year. The theme and accompanying exhibition — Superfine: Tailoring Black Style — marked a historic moment for the Costume Institute, which organizes the fundraising gala with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. It is the first exhibition to focus on designers of color and only the second show dedicated to menswear. (The first was Bravehearts: Men in Skirts in 2003.)

	











Superfine is inspired by the scholar Monica L. Miller's excellent book Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity, a cultural history of Black dandyism and its most influential sartorial figures, and Andrew Bolton, head curator at the Institute, tapped Miller to help build the exhibition.

	“Who will do this well?” I asked my friend, as if she were an oracle. It turns out not that many people — but the ones who did understand the assignment made powerful impressions. 


	Adhering to a core tenet of the Black dandy, the evening's dress code was a broad, interpretive invitation to choose an outfit tailored to the wearer. The best-dressed guests found distinctive modes of self-expression within these capacious parameters. They, like the Black dandies of the 18th and 19th centuries, used their attire to remix their past and respond to their present. These outfits — like Lauryn Hill's gorgeous yellow get-up or Teyana Taylor's intimate maroon costume — embodied what dandy artist and special consultant to the exhibition Iké Udé called “future perfect.” Their clothes radiated a visionary and forward-thinking energy. 


	The more underwhelming outfits stayed within the realm of convention, leaning more heavily into precise tailoring than a radical vision of fashion. These were mostly forgettable ensembles, clothes that would not cause a stir and are likely to fade with time (see Sydney Sweeney in Miu Miu and Nicole Kidman in Balenciaga.) It's notable that most of them were worn by white celebrities, who seemed to struggle in their interpretation of this year's theme. There were few egregious faux pas, but I will be contemplating why BlackPink member Lisa's custom Louis Vuitton one piece, which featured embroidered portraits by the artist Henry Taylor, included a figure who bears a striking resemblance to Rosa Parks right on her crotch area. 

	











	As always, the stairs set the tone for the night, inviting guests and spectators watching through the Vogue livestream (which ended promptly at 9 p.m., excluding many of the most fashionable attendees) into the otherworldly interior constructed by Raul Avila. This year's steps were carpeted with a deep blue fabric adorned with white and yellow daffodils. The striking design was the brainchild of the artist Cy Gavin, whose enormous paintings have a celestial quality to them. 


	The evening began with the arrival of the gala's chairs — Wintour, Pharrell Williams, Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky and Colman Domingo — and the range within the group reflected the kinds of outfits presented throughout the evening. LeBron James, who was named honorary chair, could not attend because of a knee injury. His wife, Savannah James, still attended, wearing a custom burgundy pinstripe suit designed by Hanifa, the label run by Congolese designer Anifa Mvuemba.  


	Wintour didn't stray from her usual uniform in her custom silver dress by Louis Vuitton (they are the exhibition sponsors) and a powder blue coat; Williams, who serves as Men's Creative Director of Louis Vuitton, left much to be desired despite the flair of his double-breasted blazer made of 100,000 pearls. Together, these two represented the safer, more ordinary set and some of the outfits that fell flat. 


	Hamilton, A$AP Rocky and Domingo were the winners among this group of gala helmers, with looks that either embraced the drama of Black style or the finer details that define Black dandyism's legacy. Hamilton wore an ivory ensemble designed by Grace Wales Bonner and a beret by Stephen Jones Millinery that gestured toward Barkley L. Hendricks portraits and told a story through its jeweled embellishments, from the baobab flower affixed to his lapel to the cowrie shells and pearls dotting his jacket tail. A$AP Rocky wore a three-piece black suit he designed himself with Christian Louboutin shoes. His hair was an event too, with cornrows wrapping around his head like a crown.

	











	Domingo's outfit was a double whammy of Black queer history and personal style. The Sing Sing actor started the evening with a cobalt blue, intricately embroidered cape by Valentino that recalled the outfits of the late André Leon Talley and the ones that members of a church choir would wear. Later, Domingo sloughed off that layer to reveal another Valentino get-up: a double-breasted wool jacket embellished with pearls and crystals, a black neck scarf with hand-painted white polka dots, and wide-leg wool trousers. 


	The understated playfulness of Hamilton's attire found echoes in other outfits from the evening — including Jenna Ortega's dazzling form-fitting Balmain dress constructed entirely out of metal rulers, as well as Balmain creative director Olivier Rousteing's metal sewing machine-shaped bag and gold metal shirt under his wide-shoulder suit. Zendaya, who surprised guests at the Met Gala last year with two distinct red carpet outfits, opted for a subtler look this year. Working with co-conspirator Law Roach, who also styled Tyla, Jeremy Pope, Jon Batiste, Nicki Minaj and Andre 3000, Zendaya channelled Bianca Jagger's bridal look with a deftly tailored cream silk suit from Louis Vuitton and a complementary wide-brimmed hat. I would be remiss not to mention Kerry Washington's custom piece from Simkhai, which featured a plunging neckline, an organza-like A-line skirt, mesh gloves and a matching cream hat. 


	Not everyone kept quiet though. Some of the evening's most memorable looks leaned into drama, functioning as discrete stories about the people wearing them. I'm thinking about Diana Ross's gasp-worthy outfit designed by Ugo Mozie with its 18-foot train, which had the names of her children and grandchildren embroidered into it. Or Teyana Taylor's outfit, which was designed in collaboration with Academy-Award winning costume designer Ruth E. Carter. 

	











	I could talk about Taylor's maroon ensemble — the pinstripes, the durag underneath the hat, the David Yurman jewels adorning the pants, the walking stick and the words “Harlem Rose” inscribed into the cape — all day, so compelling was its marriage of Harlem's past and present, with a slight nod to its future. Her outfit felt particularly meaningful when she, conducting red carpet interviews for Vogue with Ego Nwodim (in Christopher John Rogers), spoke to Harlem legend Dapper Dan. He wore a white zoot suit embroidered with the Ghanaian adinkra symbol, sankofa, which instructs us to revisit the past in order to understand the future. How beautiful it was to see two Harlem icons, past and present, talking about what this evening means for their futures. 


	Other dramatic storytellers included Whoopi Goldberg, Al Sharpton, Doja Cat, Brian Tyree Henry, Jodi Turner-Smith (in a stunning burgundy Burberry suit that paid homage to Black equestrian Selika Lazevski) and Damson Idris, who had handlers tear off his F1 suit (complete with a bedazzled helmet) to reveal a three-piece crimson suit by Tommy Hilfiger.


	There was also Janelle Monae, who collaborated with Oscar-winning costume designer Paul Tazewell (Wicked) and Thom Browne to create a costume that bent time. Her “time-traveling dandy,” as she referred to the look, fit into the musician's Afro-futurist leanings while also playing with sharp tailoring. The exterior garment was a striking red, white and black pinstripe jacket that looked like an optical illusion. Monae continued that motif in the interior, which featured a more fitted two-piece skirt-and-jacket combo. She completed the look with a top hat and cheeky monocle. 

	











	However, perhaps no one could top Rihanna, who arrived fashionably late and debuted a baby bump while wearing a Marc Jacobs ensemble that included a gray bustier and black floor-length skirt, or Andre 3000, who showed up on the carpet with a piano affixed to his back. In a move that felt in sync with the idea of being a Black dandy — that is, to surprise and subvert — he used the opportunity to release a new project called 7 Piano Sketches. But what I'd really like to know is what he was carrying in that trash bag.

Head back to the hot-pink resort on July 23.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



	It's the final season in paradise for Acapulco. Apple TV+ has now officially labeled season four of the comedy series the final season; the show will return on Wednesday, July 23 with a pair of episodes.


Acapulco season four was announced in August. Now in May, everyone involved is having a tough time saying goodbye.




	“These four seasons have been magical,” Eugenio Derbez, the bilingual show's star and executive producer, said in a statement. “Acapulco brought joy and heart to audiences around the world, and while saying goodbye is bittersweet, I'm so proud of what we created. From our incredible cast, writers, and directors, to the way we celebrated Mexico's culture, beauty, and warmth — it's been an unforgettable ride.”

	Executive producers Austin Winsberg and Sam Laybourne added, “We are so grateful to Eugenio Derbez, Apple, Lionsgate and all of our producing partners for the four amazing seasons we got to do of Acapulco. This show has been a true miracle in the vast TV landscape — a bilingual, feel-good comedy with a predominantly Latin cast. It has been an honor and a privilege to work with this incredible cast, crew and writers every single day. This family that we all created together will be deeply missed.”


	Morgan Wandell, head of international programming for Apple TV+, echoed, “It has been a joy to see audiences around the world embrace the rich characters and storytelling of Acapulco. Eugenio, Ben, Austin, Sam, and the entire cast and crew have made Las Colinas one of the most entertaining and heart filled destinations on television, and after four incredible seasons, we have no doubt that Acapulco will continue to be celebrated for its spirit, humor and emotion.”


	In season four, present-day Máximo (Derbez) works to restore Las Colinas to its former glory before its grand reopening, per Apple's logline. Back in 1986, when a competitor claims the top spot in the annual ranking of Acapulco's “Best Hotels,” a young Máximo (Enrique Arrizon) does whatever it takes to secure Las Colinas's future.


	The ensemble cast includes Fernando Carsa, Rafael Cebrián, Vanessa Bauche, Camila Perez, Carlos Corona, Chord Overstreet, Regina Reynoso, Jessica Collins and Regina Orozco. In addition to returning favorites Damián Alcázar, Jaime Camil and Cristo Fernández. Keyla Monterroso Mejia and Omar Chaparro join the new season as recurring guest stars.

	











Acapulco comes from Lionsgate Television; it is also produced by 3Pas Studios, Zihuatanejo Productions and The Tannenbaum Company. The series is inspired by 3Pas Studios and Pantelion Films' How to Be A Latin Lover, which starred Derbez and Salma Hayek.


	Ben Odell is executive producer of Acapulco, which was created by Winsberg, Eduardo Cisneros and Jason Shuman; Laybourne serves as showrunner. Additional executive producers include Kim and Eric Tannenbaum, as well as Jason Wang on behalf of The Tannenbaum Company. Jaime Eliezer Karas also executive produces and directs, and Sonia Gambaro co-executive produces for 3Pas Studios.

Off-White creative director IB Kamara said, “The precise simplicity of this black and cream look for Kamala D. Harris complements her own strength and confidence, two qualities I consider to be the core of dandyism.”


							By 

	Chris Gardner



Kamala Harris made her Met Gala debut on Monday night.


	The former vice president of the United States, who has maintained a relatively low profile since being defeated in November's presidential election by Donald Trump, stepped out in style on fashion's biggest night at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.




	In official images released by Off-White, Harris is pictured wearing a black-and-cream gown designed by the house's creative director IB Kamara. The set of pictures features Harris standing alone in the regal creation, as well as greeting Kamara and posing with the designer and her husband, Doug Emhoff.

	Off-White also released a statement from Kamara about his inspiration for the dress, a black and cream cady silk dress featuring a silk scarf and dramatic sleeve. “The precise simplicity of this black and cream look for Kamala D. Harris complements her own strength and confidence, two qualities I consider to be the core of dandyism,” Kamara explained.

	The Met Gala serves as the Metropolitan Museum of Art's annual marquee fundraiser. This year's installment celebrates the Costume Institute's spring fashion exhibition, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” which draws inspiration from Monica L. Miller's 2009 book Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity. The evening's theme, given to guests and stylists as a way to interpret the dress code, was “Tailored for you.” Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky and Pharrell Williams are the 2025 co-chairs alongside Vogue's Anna Wintour and honorary chair LeBron James (who pulled out last minute, citing a knee injury).

The artist and her longtime manager Roger Gold have parted ways.

	Lyndsey Havens



Camila Cabello and her longtime manager Roger Gold have parted ways, Billboard can confirm.


	Gold (of Gold Music Management) has managed the star since the start of her solo career in 2016, around the time of Fifth Harmony‘s breakup. Cabello released her debut solo single, “Havana,” featuring Young Thug, the following year in 2017. The breakout hit topped the Hot 100, on which Cabello has racked up a total of 22 songs including four top 10s. She scored her second Hot 100 No. 1 in 2019 with her Shawn Mendes collaboration, “Senorita.”


	Prior to managing Cabello, Gold co-launched the independent label 300 Entertainment alongside Kevin Liles, Lyor Cohen and Todd Moscowitz. The company's early signings included Megan Thee Stallion, Gunna, Migos, Fetty Wap and Young Thug, among others. The label was acquired by Warner Music Group in 2021 and in 2022 became 300 Elektra Entertainment Group under Atlantic Music Group.

	Cabello's last release was her fourth album, C,XOXO that reached No. 13 on the Billboard 200. The project marked her first release on Geffen and Interscope following her departure from Epic Records, on which Fifth Harmony was signed in partnership with Simon Cowell's Syco Music. As Gold said in Cabello's 2024 Billboard cover story: “It was a big deal for her to find people who deeply wanted to work with her, respected her and understood her.”

	“There's a lot of people that want you to be formulaic in this business,” Gold continued later in the story. “There's pressure in general to not rock the boat too much: If something isn't broken, don't fix it. Camila is not that type of artist.”


	Gold will continue managing other clients under Gold Music Management.

Revlon's Elizabeth Arden made millions selling Britney's fragrances for years, but went to court last year over claims that its own execs took her business to an upstart rival.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



Revlon has fully settled a corporate espionage lawsuit that claimed several former employees “sabotaged” the company's decades-old fragrance partnership with Britney Spears.


	The case, filed last year by Revlon and its Elizabeth Arden unit, accused four ex-staffers of stealing trade secrets and breaching their contracts by taking the Britney account to upstart rival Give Back Beauty – a move the lawsuit described as a “heist.”


	But over the past few months, Revlon has quietly struck deals to resolve those claims – first with Give Back Beauty and one of the execs in February, then last week with three more ex-staffers. On Monday, the judge signed off on the latter deal and ruled that the “matter be closed.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The settlements have cleared the way for Give Back Beauty to formally take over Britney's lucrative perfume brand. In a February press release, the smaller company announced that it had “signed a transition agreement” with Revlon to clear the use of the intellectual property and end the legal dispute.


	“My fragrance business has always held a special place in my heart,” Spears said at the time. “It's always been a way for me to connect with my fans, who I love. I'm excited for this new chapter and bringing more beauty into the world with Give Back Beauty.”


	A rep for Revlon did not immediately return a request for comment on the resolution of the litigation.


	Spears first inked a deal with Elizabeth Arden in 2004, launching her “Curious” scent later that year to a reported $100 million in sales. By 2013, that brand had reportedly sold more than 500 million bottles and the overall Spears-Arden partnership was earning $30 million a year. But last year Spears declined to renew the deal and instead signed with Give Back Beauty, an Italian firm founded in 2017.


	Faced with the loss of a valuable partnership, Revlon went the legal route – claiming that Britney had not simply walked away, but had been illegally poached by Give Back Beauty. The lawsuit claimed four Arden staffers (Vanessa Kidd, Dominick Romeo, Reid Mulvihill and Ashley Fass) had secretly helped orchestrate the star's departure, including one who allegedly “acted as a double-agent” – working directly with Give Back Beauty while ostensibly negotiating with Britney's team to renew her Revlon deal.


	“Revlon and Elizabeth Arden were completely unaware that Revlon's own team was actively sabotaging one of their most valuable licensing relationships,” the company's lawyers claimed at the time. Spears herself was not named in the lawsuit nor accused of any wrongdoing.


	Give Back Beauty and the former execs strongly denied the allegations, arguing in a later legal response that Revlon had gone to court with a “false narrative” of espionage and corporate raiding simply because it was angry that it had been beaten by a competitor.


	“Revlon's motion is … an anticompetitive ruse to damage a competitor because Revlon, weakened in the market by its recent bankruptcy, cannot compete fairly with GBB, and seeks to frustrate GBB's transition of Britney Brands, at the same time, sending a warning about future competition from an international rival that poses a growing threat to Revlon's market share,” the smaller company's lawyers wrote at the time.


	But by February, despite the strongly-word legal broadsides, Give Back Beauty and Revlon had apparently struck a deal to end their dispute. Beyond allowing Give Back to take over the IP for the brand, the terms of the deal have not been disclosed in court filings.


	“Give Back Beauty will bring Britney's fragrance and beauty business to another level,” Corrado Brondi, the company's founder, wrote at the time. “We are looking forward to building on that legacy, introducing innovations to her product lines and expanding the brand into new markets globally, while ensuring that the spirit and authenticity of her brand remain intact.”


	The February settlements covered Give Back itself and Ashley Fass; the settlement approved Monday covered Kidd, Romeo, Mulvihill. Reps for both sides did not immediately return requests for comment.

The superstar revealed her bump shortly before making her appearance at the Met Gala on May 5.


													By
												

	Anna Chan



	Please recognize she's trying! Shortly before arriving at the Met Gala in New York City on Monday (May 5), Rihanna revealed that she's pregnant with her third child with partner A$AP Rocky. So not surprisingly, in addition to discussing what she was wearing for fashion's biggest night, there were questions about whether growing her family would mean delaying her already long-awaited ninth studio album.


	When asked about that on the blue carpet, Ri — who was in a custom Marc Jacobs — had a very confident answer. “Noooooo!” she insisted about the upcoming album's arrival to Entertainment Tonight before admitting some things might come a little later. “Maybe a couple videos! I can still sing!”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	The “Umbrella” singer — who shares sons RZA, nearly 3, and Riot Rose, 1, with Rocky — also joked earlier on to reporters as she was walking the carpet at the star-studded event that she “brought the kid!” Though she was dressed to the nines and in high heels, she told ET that she was feeling good that night. “I'm shockingly feeling OK and not too overwhelmed at the moment,” she shared before admitting that perhaps her third pregnancy did have her feeling a little bit overwhelmed in the beginning. “At first, it was kinda like, ‘Ahhhhhhhh,' and ‘I'm tired,'” the nine-time Grammy winner said. “But then I'm excited.”


	As for the “Tailor Swif” rapper, he was excited to let the world in on the couple's happy news. “We were tired of holding that, and it was time to show the people what we was cooking up,” he told the Associated Press. “I'm glad everybody's happy for us, because we're definitely happy.”


	And hopefully soon, Ri's Navy will also be happy with the eventual arrival of R9. The “Disturbia” singer last released an album nearly a decade ago when she dropped Anti in February 2016. As for the delayed set? Ri shared in her March Harper's Bazaar cover story that contrary to what she called “way off” rumors, the album would not be reggae. 


	“There's no genre now. That's why I waited,” the star explained. “After a while, I looked at it, and I was like, this much time away from music needs to count for the next thing everyone hears. It has to count. It has to matter. I have to show them the worth in the wait. I cannot put up anything mediocre. After waiting eight years, you might as well just wait some more.”

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Amazon MGM Studios has landed worldwide distribution rights to The Beekeeper 2 in a deal pegged by sources at comfortably north of $50M. 


Jason Statham will reprise his role in the sequel, which is due to start production in the fall. As we previously revealed, Timo Tjahjanto (Nobody 2) is set to direct the film from a screenplay by Kurt Wimmer. Miramax is producing and negotiated the deal with Amazon.


	The first movie, directed by David Ayer, follows a retired clandestine human-intelligence operative who sets out for revenge after his kind-hearted landlady becomes the victim of a phishing scam that steals millions of dollars from a charity she runs. It garnered $163M at the global box office after being sold by Miramax to international distributors and Amazon for domestic.

	The sequel is due to be released theatrically in a number of key territories. We've heard there's a chance it could be among the early movies released via Amazon's new international theatrical arm. 


	As we noted last week, this type of deal will likely become more common for Miramax as it moves away from in-house international sales. Patrick Wachsberger's 193 will be selling Scandalous! for Miramax in Cannes.

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


Netflix announced this morning that Jay Kelly, Noah Baumbach‘s new film starring George Clooney and Adam Sandler, is slated for release in theaters on November 14 and will debut on streaming on December 5.


	The service also unveiled a first-look still of Clooney as the title character, which you can view below.


	In announcing Jay Kelly, Netflix referred to the project as a “heartbreaking comedy,” though little about the project is known apart from that. Per the logline, everybody knows Jay Kelly…but Jay Kelly doesn't know himself.


	Baumbach wrote the script for the pic — marking his fourth outing with Netflix — with Emily Mortimer, one of many others featuring in the ensemble. He also produced the film alongside David Heyman and Amy Pascal, the duo who recently inked a deal to produce the next Bond film at Amazon MGM. Additional cast includes Billy Crudup, Laura Dern, Grace Edwards, Stacy Keach, Riley Keough, Patrick Wilson, Nicôle Lecky, Thaddea Graham, Jim Broadbent, Eve Hewson, Alba Rohrwacher, Lenny Henry, Josh Hamilton, Greta Gerwig, and Ruby Stokes.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Baumbach has a long history with Netflix, having first partnered with the streamer on the release for his 2017 dysfunctional family dramedy The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected), starring Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and more. Following that acclaimed Cannes title, Baumbach reunited with the streamer on 2019's Marriage Story, starring Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, a poignant exploration of divorce that garnered six Oscar nominations and secured Dern a statuette for Best Supporting Actress.


	On the heels of Marriage Story‘s success, Baumbach inked an exclusive multi-year deal to write and direct films for the platform in 2021. He released his third Netflix film, an adaptation of Don DeLillo's postmodern novel White Noise starring Driver and Gerwig, the following year.

	The movie, which arrived in theaters in the U.S. on March 21, saw a $42.2 million opening weekend on its way to a global box office take of $200.5 million, a disappointing result for the latest Disney live-action redo of its animated library titles. This one, directed by Marc Webb, cost a reported $270 million and endured reshoots, labor strikes, a fire on the set, release-date changes and candid comments by Zegler in the lead-up to the release that caused a stir.

	In March, Deadline's sources reported that pic was on track to lose an estimated $115 million after all global home entertainment, TV and Disney+ ancillaries. That loss, which was expected, was based on a final worldwide box office of $225M.

			By Max Goldbart, Andreas Wiseman 


EXCLUSIVE: Amazon has picked up AGC Studios‘ Kaley Cuoco-starring thriller series Vanished for several territories.


Vanished, which stars Sam Claflin (Peaky Blinders), three-time Cesar winner Karin Viard (The Bélier Family), German actor Matthias Schweighöfer (Army of the Dead), Simon Abkarian (Casino Royale) and Dar Zuzovsky (Corduroy), will air on Prime Video next year in the UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Stuart Ford's AGC is selling worldwide rights and cameras are rolling in Paris and Marseille. Barnaby Thompson directs.


	Deadline first told you about the project at Series Mania in March, at which point AGC launched sales. In Vanished, Big Bang Theory star Cuoco plays Alice. When a romantic getaway to Paris takes a dark turn with the sudden disappearance of her boyfriend Tom (Claflin) aboard a train to France, she is plunged into a web of intrigue and danger, uncovering secrets about the man she thought she knew.

Vanished is from AGC Studios, created by David Hilton and Preston Thompson, written by Preston Thompson (Pixie, Kids in Love) and executive produced by James Clayton (Slow Burn Entertainment), David Kosse (Rockwood Pictures), Barnaby Thompson (Fragile Films), Preston Thompson, Cuoco and AGC's Stuart Ford, Lourdes Diaz and Miguel A. Palos Jr. AGC's VP of Legal & Business Affairs Conor McElroy negotiated the deal on behalf of AGC.


Vanished is the latest hot drama series Amazon has pre-bought. The streamer has taken rights in several European territories on Catherine Zeta-Jones-starrer Kill Jackie and has U.S. plus others on Justin Kurzel's The Narrow Road to the Deep North adaptation starring Jacob Elordi. Those two are sold by Fremantle and Sony respectively.


	Speaking at MIP London in Feb, Amazon UK exec Hannah Blyth said deals like Kill Jackie are examples of how Amazon is adapting to the current financial market. She said Amazon may not have global on these titles but will still be involved editorially and in financing conversations from an early stage in order to get projects over the line.


	Tushar Jindal, Head of Content Acquisitions, Prime Video UK, said of Vanished: “With Kaley and Sam leading an incredible cast, this gripping thriller will keep viewers guessing at every turn. We can't wait for audiences to be swept up in the mystery.”

	











	Abkarian is repped by Alternative Agency and Cadre Entertainment. Zuzovsky is repped by Markham, Froggatt and Irwin, Principal Entertainment and Goodman, Genow.

	Negotiations were handled by Nicholas Bennett on behalf of Bleiberg Entertainment.


	“We're excited to make the film and work with these actors,” said Lance Kawas and Asif Akbar. “We loved the idea of making a film like this that hearkens back to the old school high-stakes sexy thrillers of the 90s like Basic Instinct or Fatal Attraction but with a touch of more action and intensity.”


	“We're thrilled to be representing this film. To have this cast portraying the two classic tropes of the cunning femme fatale and the hardened CIA assassin and watch them realize they still have feelings for one another while each is trying to outsmart and outmaneuver and ultimately defeat the other. It's going to be a lot of fun,” added Ariel Bleiberg, Head of Acquisitions and Development at Bleiberg.

Former Baywatch babe Pamela Anderson was rocking two eye-catching accessories at the May 5 Met Gala.

One was a new short hairdo- a cropped bob with baby bangs.

The other- her oldest son with rocker Tommy Lee- 28-year-old Brandon Thomas Lee.

The 57-year-old actress wore a sparkly, bejewelled long-sleeve Tory Burch gown encrusted with layers of intricate beading, jewels and sequins. And while she kept true to her new look of minimal makeup, she did add a diamond Pandora ear cuff to complete the fit.

A post shared by Good Morning America (@goodmorningamerica)

A post shared by Pamela Anderson (@pamelaanderson)

Pamela Anderson summed up how she felt about her look for the Met Gala in three words.

In an Instagram post showing her from every angle, she wrote: ‘Bold… Brave… Precise. A celebration of courage and craftsmanship. Thank you for the invitation—an honor. Love, P'.

And her fans were quick to agree, including singer Katy Perry.

The pop star commented: ‘One of my favorite looks! And the hair was the cherry ❤️'.

Perry has sported some of the most iconic looks of the Met Gala in years past, but was not at this year's event.

Fans and followers on Instagram gushed: ‘WOW this hair and this look are perfection love the hair!!!!”; ‘Absolutely sublime! You look ethereal!' ‘THE MOST GORGEOUS GIRL IN THE WORLD'.

‘You look fabulous! Love this new hair on you!'; ‘Bold, brave, and BOB!! ‘Pamela Anderson is a goddess!'; 

“Love the bob, fringe & bold lippy! The dress is stunning too. Gorgeous.”

“THE MOST GORGEOUS GIRL IN THE WORLD”

Others commented on her timeless, old Hollywood look, writing, “Pam is so naturally beautiful, her profile is amazing. She reminds me of Mia Farrow with her hair like this 😍”

‘Stunning as always! Pamela brings timeless glam to the Met. ✨'; ‘beauty. Old hollywood glam vibes.'

“channeling Mia Farrow 🤍”

Pandora, who Anderson is a spokesperson for, also chimed in with “An absolutely incredible look! It is an honor to have our jewelry worn by you at the Met Gala again. 💕”

Anderson's oldest son, Brandon Thomas Lee, kept his look simple with a classic black tuxedo by Genuardi. 

Pam shares sons Brandon, 28, and Dylan Lee, 26, with her ex-husband, musician Tommy Lee.

And this isn't the first time Brandon has been Pam's plus one. 

A post shared by Brandon Thomas Lee (@brandonthomaslee)

He was her date to this year's Golden Globes, when Anderson was nominated for her performance in “The Last Showgirl.”

In an Instagram post about the night, Lee wrote, “Such a wonderful evening and so incredibly proud of @pamelaanderson for all she has accomplished with her film The @lastshowgirl . With only 18 days to shoot and a small budget this film and your performance stand amongst the giants it was nominated next to. I think @jamieleecurtis said it best… 1 in 10 is magic… and I think you have done just that. ✨

I can't wait to see where we go from here 🙏”

Danielle Cabral showed off a new look—and fans had to do a double take because she looked so different.

In May 2025, “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” star posted two new photos to Instagram after having her hair done by hair stylist and colorist Kevin Kelly.

In the photos, Cabral posed to showcase her brunette locks, which were enhanced by Kelly's luxury extensions. “You couldn't pay me to go back to blonde 🤌,” Cabral captioned the snaps.

A post shared by Color | Extension Specialist | Event Styling (@kevinkelly.hair)

During her two seasons on RHONJ, Cabral wore her hair blonde, so the new look was quite a departure.Fans and friends commented on the mom of two's new chocolate brown color.

“Loving this color on you!” wrote fellow RHONJ cast member Melissa Gorga.

This is your look 🙌 never go blonde again… this color is 😍😍😍😍 … PERIOD ,” added pal Tiffany Chantell-Rosania.

“So Beautiful as a Brunette ❤️🔥 Ur killing it Girl 😍,” another fan wrote.

“Love your hair! This looks so much better on you ❤️,” another agreed.

This is not Cabral's first hair change since RHONJ went on hiatus, but it's the biggest change from her original blonde look. In August, she posted photos of her shorter, layered, highlighted hair color that was darker than the blonde shade she boasted during her first two seasons on RHONJ, but considerably lighter than her new shade. “WELCOME TO MY DARK SIDE….🖤” she captioned the pics at the time.

RHONJ is currently on “pause” after a rocky 14th season that ended with multiple cast member feuds.  There has been talk of a recasting or full reboot for season 15. Cabral does not know her status on the show as of yet.

In an interview on the “Off the Vine With Kaitlyn Bristowe” podcast, Cabral admitted she had doubts about a return for season 15. “That's a very loaded question,” the Bouhje Kidz founder said. “I don't know if I could handle another season with what I went through this year with certain people. But if we can get back to the Jersey that I love, I could do that all day.”

“Catty I could do all day,” Cabral added. “Evil and twisted….I don't sign up for that, man…That's way dark.”

Cabral previously joked that she was not a great “Housewife.” Speaking with Access Hollywood's Housewives Nightcap in July 2024, she admitted, “I've said this to production many times, I'm like a terrible Housewife. I could care less about like trying to come and kill these people. Just put the camera up and film my life and film my friendships.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Coach Says Goodbye to ‘The Voice' After Brief Run","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-voice/leann-rimes-leaves-uk-version/","Tue, 06 May 2025 17:27:34 GMT","

Coach LeAnn Rimes is officially stepping away from “The Voice” UK edition after just one season in the red chair. While some exits come with drama or behind-the-scenes buzz, this one? It's all about timing, opportunity, and keeping things positive.

After joining the UK version of “The Voice” for its latest season, Rimes brought her signature powerhouse vocals, heartfelt coaching, and years of experience to a new batch of aspiring artists. But now, according to American Songwriter, she's made the call to leave the show, citing a packed schedule and other creative priorities.

This doesn't feel like a door slammed shut. More like a window cracked open for something new.

Rimes posted to Instagram in May hinting at a possible change in her career path saying, “i am SO ready for you and the exciting new journey i am about to embark on! stay tuned….”

A post shared by leann rimes cibrian (@leannrimes)

While her time as a coach in the UK may be over (for now), Rimes isn't leaving “The Voice” universe entirely. In fact, she headed straight for the big leagues in the U.S. version as a season 25 mega mentor, alongside another music icon, Sheryl Crow. So no, this isn't a goodbye… it's more like a “see you on a different stage.”

As a mega mentor, Rimes will help guide contestants during the critical Playoff Rounds, where every note counts. And given her history; think Grammy wins, chart-toppers, and a decades-long career that's somehow still underrated. She's bringing some serious firepower to the table.

Rimes posted on Threads saying, “uh…. making a very big life/career decision this morning. something completely new and different. something a bit scary and out of my comfort zone… i think i have to say yes! maybe” with a few emojis.It seems the decision to step away from the UK series isn't about burnout or backlash. It's about focusing on what matters most: her music, upcoming projects, and showing up where she can make the biggest impact. That kind of intentional pivot? Total power move.

And let's not forget, coaching is just one chapter in her ongoing story. With this new U.S. mentorship role, Rimes gets to support artists without being tied to a full season. Sounds like the best of both worlds.

So while some fans might be bummed to see her go, the takeaway here is simple: LeAnn Rimes is still showing up, still shining, and still helping shape the next generation of stars… just on her own terms.

We're rooting for her every step of the way.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘American Idol' Runner-Up is Now a Public Speaker","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/justin-guarini-is-a-public-speaker/","Tue, 06 May 2025 03:52:02 GMT","

Remember Justin Guarini? The velvet-voiced, curly-haired runner-up from the very first season of “American Idol” (aka the guy who stood toe-to-toe with Kelly Clarkson before she became THE Kelly Clarkson)? Well, he's still very much in the spotlight… just not in the way you might expect. Turns out, Guarini has taken everything he learned from being a performer and turned it into something way more personal: public speaking and confidence coaching.

Yep, he went from singing live in front of millions to helping other people find the courage to step into their own spotlight.

A post shared by Justin Guarini (@justinguarini)

Guarini spent years performing on Broadway, doing voiceover work, starring in Diet Dr. Pepper commercials as “Lil' Sweet,” and generally staying booked and busy. After all of that he founded Profit Under Pressure, LLC., a coaching platform where he helps creatives, entrepreneurs, and speakers build what he calls “Unshakable Confidence,” according to The Global Discussion.

And this isn't some vague self-help fluff. Guarini created a method called the “Unbreakable Core Confidence Method,” which digs deep into mindset work, performance techniques, and real-world experience to help people show up authentically and powerfully; whether that's on a stage or in a boardroom.

He also speaks at schools and conferences around the country. His talks, like “The Confidence to Fail” and “The Celebrity Code,” are all about getting real with fear, self-doubt, and imposter syndrome; and then bulldozing through them with a little humor and a lot of heart.

It seems as though Guarini believes that what makes you different is what makes you powerful. And let's be real: coming from someone who's been in the public eye for over two decades, that hits different.

Justin hasn't ditched the spotlight. If anything, he's just redirected it. These days, he's also working with young performers through things like the Warrior Artist Alliance and talking to high schoolers about the power of owning your story, per Broadway Podcast Network. His 2023 visit to Quakertown Community High School had students genuinely moved by how open and honest he was about the ups and downs of fame, life, and everything in between.

So yeah, Justin Guarini may not be battling it out in weekly sing-offs anymore, but he's still got the same goal: making people feel something. Only now, instead of lyrics and melodies, he's using stories, vulnerability, and a killer delivery.

Talk about a second act.

Adam Lambert is ascending to one of the most coveted musical roles in Broadway history.

The “American Idol” star is set to join a special production of “Jesus Christ Superstar” in Hollywood this summer with a buzzy cast.

A post shared by Hollywood Bowl (@hollywoodbowl)

Lambert will take on the role of Jesus's frenemy, Judas. Broadway turned film star Cynthia Erivo will be taking on the role of Jesus.

No word yet on who's playing Mary Magdalene.

“Jesus Christ Superstar” tells the story of Jesus's relationships with his disciples and followers, Judas, Magdalene, and the Roman Empire. 

A post shared by Hollywood Bowl (@hollywoodbowl)

Lambert was recently nominated for the iHeartRadio Music Award Fan Favorite Broadway Debut for his role as The Emcee in “Cabaret at the Kit Kat Club.” He told the New York Times playing the role was “therapeutic” and he tried to differentiate his version from other famous people – including Eddie Redmayne, Neil Patrick Harris, John Stamos and others – who have taken on the role.

 “I really loved Eddie's take on this sort of demented puppet master ventriloquist dummy. But that didn't resonate for me as what I was going to do,” he told the outlet. “I was like, the Emcee's probably a little drunk. He's probably a little high on something. And he's in this permissive environment… That's who he is in my sense of him.”

When asked if he compares himself to his Emcee predecessors, he says he learned early in his career as a singer that comparisons are unwise.“When I was younger as a theater performer and even as a recording artist, I had the tendency to look and compare myself to people. And it made me miserable. It limited me, and it made me get in my head and second-guess myself,” Lambert elaborates. “One of the things I've learned as I've gotten older and more mature is like, no, no, no. Got to do you. That's what the audience is going to respond to the most. That's what's going to make you the happiest as a performer and feel as free as possible.”

Lambert also mentioned he's in the early stages of writing his own musical.

Fans of the Hollywood Bowl venue can buy season tickets to the shows there starting Tuesday, May 6 at 10 AM PT. 

This new production of “Jesus Christ Superstar” features the famed lyrics and music by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber respectively. Director and choreographer Sergio Trujillo will take on leadership duties. Stephen Oremus is the conductor and musical director. 

The original version of the show was released as a concept album in 1970 before premiering on Broadway in 1971. It was nominated for five Tony Awards. Revivals of the show were staged in 1977, 2000, and 2012. A film version was released in 1973. A televised version dubbed “Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert” starring John Legend was aired in 2018 on NBC.    

The performances for this short run of “Jesus Christ Superstar” will begin Friday, August 1 and go through Sunday, August 3.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Who Are the Bachelors of Bravo's New Show ‘King's Court'","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/bachelors-of-bravo-show-kings-court/","Tue, 06 May 2025 04:14:05 GMT","

On May 5, Bravo announced their new dating show, “King's Court,” set to premiere on July 13 at 9 p.m.

Fans will see Tyson Beckford, Carlos Boozer, and Thaddeus Bullard go on dates with multiple women who are hoping to make a romantic connection.

A post shared by Bravo (@bravotv)

The show will be hosted by Holly Robinson Peete and her longtime husband Rodney Peete, with whom she shares four children.

In the trailer, Beckford states, “I don't care what nobody says. Dating a celebrity is very hard. Women have a hard time trusting me.”

“I have met so many women who will like, recite my stats,” former NBA player Boozer says. “But I want somebody that wants to get to know me.”

Bullard is seen telling the camera, “I'm 6,'5, 280 pounds, yeah, I'm very intimidating to a lot of people, until someone gets to know me and they realize Thaddeus is a pretty sweet guy.”

The trailer promises plenty of drama between the ladies vying for the men. So, who are Beckford, Boozer, and Bullard? Here's everything to know about the three new stars of “King's Court.”

A post shared by Tyson C Beckford (@tysoncbeckford)

Tyson Beckford (54) is a Jamaican-American model who rose to fame in the early '90s as the face of Ralph Lauren's Polo line.

In 1995, he earned a spot on People's list of the “50 Most Beautiful People in the World,” as well as the “Sexiest Man Alive” in 2013.

After being catapulted into fame as a model, Beckford made appearances in movies, such as “Zoolander” and “Into the Blue.”

He also lent his expertise on “Britain's Next Top Model” from 2011-2013, and competed in “Dancing With the Stars” season 32, where he was eliminated after the third episode.

Beckford was previously married to a woman named Berniece Julien in 2009 but they divorce the same year. 

He shares his now-adult son Jordan with his ex, April Roomet, who works as a makeup artist. “I can't take all the credit. I can take just the gentleman side of it, the father's side of it, but he has an incredible mom,” he told Us Weekly in 2020.

As for what he's looking for in a woman, he once shared with Page Six, “I am looking for my ­Beyoncé, my Rihanna.”

A post shared by Carlos Boozer (@mrcbooz)

Carlos Boozer (43) is a former NBA player with a prolific career as a basketball player. He began by playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2002, and joined the Utah Jazz team in 2004, where he stayed for six years.

In 2010, Boozer was recruited by the Chicago Bulls, and he went on to play for the Los Angeles Lakers in 2014 for a year before retiring in 2017 with China's Guangdong Southern Tigers.

Boozer has been married twice — first to Cindy Nichole Blackwell in 2003 who he divorced in 2015, and then to Aneshka Dawn Smith who he married in 2017 until they split in 2021.

Boozer and Blackwell share three kids together, Carmani, and twins Cameron and Cayden. 

In 2019, he welcomed his daughter Bloomie with Smith. “Introducing Bloom Boheme Boozer!!!! At 37 Years Old, I Didn't Know I Could Fall In Love All Over Again… Then Came Bloom… My Beautiful Wife Gave Me Our Gorgeous Angel!!! Filled With So Many Emotions!!!” he shared on Instagram. 

A post shared by Thaddeus Bullard (@titusoneilwwe)

Thaddeus Bullard (48) is also known as his WWE alter-ego, Titus O'Neil. The former football player joined the wrestling association in 2009, and appeared in “WWE NXT,” “NXT Redemption,” and “WWE Superstars.”

In 2016, Bullard joined “Raw” and went on to co-host “WrestleMania 37” in 2021 and again for “Wrestlemania 39” two years later.

Bullard was once married and has sons Thaddeus Jr. and Titus, as well as his daughter Leah. 

He posted of his complicated relationship with his ex in 2020 on Instagram. “I have never had any desire to be back with my ex wife and our relationship has never been good. Yesterday was the first time she stepped foot inside of my home in 10 years,” he wrote. 

The former pro wrestler continued, “We still will never be back together, but our kids deserve this day and we both owed it to them … I'll Always Love her and Honor her as the Mother of my children. I may not like her sometimes, but she gave me the Honor of being a Father to TWO Healthy and Amazing Sons and I am Grateful and Thankful everyday to be A FATHER!!!!”

The media and entertainment world is no stranger to existential crises. So, while the recent shutdown of Industry Arts' Coverfly and sibling platforms ScreenCraft, The Script Lab, WeScreenplay, and The Tracking Board was unfortunate, it wasn't exactly a huge disruption. Each site offered distinct services, from highlighting talent and hosting events to tracking screenplay sales. But let's be real: Hollywood never depended on them to function.

These groups were a nicety. Relatively beneficial to LA screenwriters who like to keep up with the latest sales and trends, as well as many far outside industry towns looking for a way to get noticed. Many found representation through these services; some saw their projects get made. They were also more accessible than groups like The Black List, which now handles screening services for the Academy's Nicholl Fellowship — further evidence of consolidation within the screenwriting competition industry.

Coverfly and The Tracking Board will officially shut down in August and September, respectively. IA is rumored to be working on a new all-in-one platform that merges these brands' efforts. Maybe that will streamline the process and offer more to screenwriters. Maybe not.

But if you're a screenwriter waiting for the next platform to save you — don't. Seriously. Hell, no.

The pipeline for getting your script made has dried up. Blame COVID. Blame the strikes. Blame studios that refuse to greenlight new projects. Whatever the reason, the path to becoming a working screenwriter is harder.

Coverfly's gone. But maybe throwing your script into a pit of other scripts in the hopes of earning someone's attention was never a foolproof strategy. Especially when there are so many other ways that may be more effective.

Let's break them down.

We live on screens now — phones, TVs, laptops — and your personal platform is your new resume. With tools like Wix, Squarespace, and Canva, it's easier than ever to build a site to showcase your scripts, short films, or creative process. If there's a learning curve, ride it: The skill set is common enough that you risk being at a disadvantage without it, and building a site forces you to refine the essential element of how you pitch yourself.

 










💻 BUILD A WEBSITE IN UNDER 20 MINS USING CANVA 💻  I've recently added a new service 👉🏼 @madebymairead_ (insta) I needed a quick and easy website to display my portfolio and manage enquiries so I used this Canva tip This is a great easy and budget friendly option for businesses if they just need to showcase information.  🚨This is not an alternative to a full website ~ you can't install a pixel and run ads to this but it's a great start  Follow @crossboxmarketing for more tips!  #canvahack #websitebuilder #socialmediamarketing #smallbusinesshelp #canva #canvadesign

You can't just write a great script and expect a deal anymore. Today, screenwriters need to be their own brand. That means staying visible. Start a Substack. Post videos on TikTok or YouTube about your creative journey. Share advice, updates, behind-the-scenes content. Build a following — not for vanity, but to show you're serious and consistent. Demonstrating yourself as a professional will go far in earning that title from others.

Success in screenwriting often comes from finding community. You need collaborators who balance your weaknesses. Are you a writer who wants to direct? Find a producer or cinematographer who shares your vision. Your ideal team might not be experienced; maybe it's just a friend who takes great photos and is crazy organized. When you're starting out, trust is more important than credits.

Mark Duplass at SXSW dropping major wisdom. 

If you're a writer who wants to see your work on screen, stop waiting for permission. Even if writing is truly the only thing for you, find a collaborator interested in directing and producing and make something. Work on a microbudget or no budget at all. The final product — short film, pilot, a proof-of-concept reel — speaks louder than a logline. Finished work gets noticed. Spec scripts get buried.

 










No one wants to DM strangers on LinkedIn or ask friends for introductions. You probably don't even want to bother your own family. We get it — but to do this, you must risk annoyance. Becoming a genuine pain in the ass is usually not the way, but you have to balance your innate emotional intelligence with following up and putting yourself out there. Success is not a waiting game; the difference between those who make it and those who don't often comes down to sheer persistence. If you're not connected, find someone who is — and then another. Keep going.

People in Hollywood are starving and aren't making money bc of people like Zaslav and the streaming pay structure and nothing being made anymore #hbo #netflix #prime #hulu #streaming #writer #tvfilm

Living in L.A. or NYC, funding your own projects, networking — draining your funds can end a screenwriting career before it begins. It can feel like only rich kids or nepo babies can afford to play the game. If that discourages you enough to quit, there are other careers built around financial stability. But if the thought of selling out is worse than grinding through, remember: Getting rich is just as hard as getting produced. Might as well chase the dream.

The Anthony Bourdain A24 biopic “Tony” is looking to be as authentic as possible — and have real chefs star alongside “The Holdovers” breakout Dominic Sessa, who is portraying late icon Bourdain. Atomic Honey Casting posted an open casting call seeking “real restaurant kitchen staff with unique, dynamic personalities” to play roles in the film. IndieWire confirmed with A24 that the casting will take place for a shoot in Provincetown, MA from May through July 2025. 

While no prior acting experience is required for the aforementioned roles, prior kitchen experience is a must. The casting call is looking for males of all ethnicities.

Sessa stars as a young Bourdain in the origin story of the “Kitchen Confidential” author and “Parts Unknown” host. Antonio Banderas co-stars in an unspecified role. “Tony” will be directed by Matt Johnson (“Blackberry”) with Todd Bartels and Lou Howe writing the script. The film was announced in April 2025, with  Bourdain's estate producing. 

“Tony” will take place during the summer of 1976, which was Bourdain's last experience on the Cape before enrolling in culinary school. The film will chart Bourdain's rise from working as a dishwasher to a line cook before starting his empire.

Bourdain died by suicide in 2018 at age 61. He posthumously was at the center of Morgan Neville's documentary, “Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain,” which included the use of artificial intelligence to recreate Bourdain's voice for the narration of three different sequences. “Part of the experience of watching Tony on television was his voice. His point of view is what made those shows,” director Neville said in 2021. “And if you actually — as I have — take his voiceover out of the shows, they're very strange and melancholic ruminations of visitations of countries around the world. His point of view does everything to those shows. I just felt like to do a film and not have his point of view expressed would be wrong.”

Neville also said in a statement of Bourdain's legacy, “Anthony Bourdain did more to help us understand each other than just about anyone in the history of television. He connected with people not in spite of his flaws, but because of them. To have the opportunity to tell his story is humbling.”

Noah Baumbach is getting back in the awards race, and he's bringing a star-studded cast including George Clooney and Adam Sandler. 

Netflix has announced that Baumbach's upcoming feature “Jay Kelly” will open in theaters on November 14 before hitting the streaming service on December 5. The announcement was accompanied by a photo of Clooney, who plays the title character, walking past a poster of himself.

“Jay Kelly” appears to be a return to the familiar territory of middle aged neuroses for Baumbach, following the apocalyptic ambition of his previous feature, “White Noise.” While little is known about the film‘s plot, it is believed to center around the relationship between Clooney's eponymous character and a longtime friend played by Sandler. A cryptic official synopsis reads “Everybody knows Jay Kelly, but Jay Kelly doesn't know himself.”

In addition to Clooney and Sandler, “Jay Kelly” stars Billy Crudup, Laura Dern, Grace Edwards, Stacy Keach, Riley Keough, Emily Mortimer, Patrick Wilson, Nicôle Lecky, Thaddea Graham, Jim Broadbent, Eve Hewson, Alba Rohrwacher, Lenny Henry, Josh Hamilton, and Greta Gerwig.

“Jay Kelly” marks the fourth collaboration between Baumbach and Netflix. His last three films, 2017's “The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected),” 2019's “Marriage Story,” and 2022's “White Noise,” were all produced by the streaming giant. “Jay Kelly” is Baumbach's first directorial effort since “White Noise,” though he picked up an Oscar nomination in the meantime for co-writing “Barbie” with his partner Greta Gerwig.

The fall release date signals that Netflix views “Jay Kelly” as an Oscar contender, and makes a major fall festival premiere seem inevitable. Baumbach's previous two Netflix films debuted at the Venice International Film Festival, while “The Meyerowitz Stories” controversially premiered at Cannes in 2017 and helped lead to the festival's refusal to screen movies produced by Netflix due to their lack of theatrical exclusivity in France.

“Jay Kelly” is directed by Noah Baumbach and co-written by Baumbach and Emily Mortimer. David Heyman and Amy Pascal, who have recently been tapped to spearhead the James Bond franchise for Amazon MGM, produce the film alongside Baumbach.

Dan Stevens, who has become synonymous with indie horror, is paired with icon Al Pacino for the ultimate exorcism film, “The Ritual.” The duo star as two priests who “face the ultimate test of faith,” as the logline teases. The film is based on the true story that was captured in 1935 book “Begone Satan!” about a Church-sanctioned exorcism. The original account of the events went on to inspire “The Exorcist” book and William Friedkin's famed 1973 film that later spurred a franchise.

The official synopsis for “The Ritual” reads: “When the Church sanctions the exorcism of Emma Schmidt (Abigail Cowan), two priests — divided by doubt — must confront a force beyond comprehension… and their own faith.” Ashley Greene and Patricia Heaton co-star.

Pacino recently told Entertainment Weekly that after starring in “The Ritual,” he can finally watch Friedkin's “The Exorcist.” Pacino worked with the late auteur on “Cruising,” which was released seven years after “The Exorcist.” 

“I didn't even see ‘The Exorcist' in my life,” Pacino said, adding, “It's a great film, I hear. I should see it. I think I'm strong enough to see it now.”

Meanwhile, Stevens is joining another horror franchise by starring in and executive producing the third installment of anthology series “The Terror: Devil in Silver.” The “Abigail” actor will play Pepper, a “working-class moving man who, through a combination of bad luck and a bad temper, finds himself wrongfully committed to New Hyde Psychiatric Hospital — an institution filled with the people society would rather forget,” the logline reads. There, he “must contend with patients who work against him, doctors who harbor grim secrets, and perhaps even the very Devil himself.”

“I'm thrilled to be a part of ‘The Terror: Devil in Silver.' This series is a dark symphony of psychological horror and gripping drama, set to rock the audience,” Stevens said in a statement. “Victor LaValle, Christopher Cantwell, and this incredible team have crafted a unique and twisted dance of devils and shadows. I look forward to delivering something epic that will echo through the halls like an iron bell.”

Karyn Kusama (“Yellowjackets”) will also executive produce the installment, and will direct the first two episodes of the six-episode season. Ridley Scott and David W. Zucker executive produce for Scott Free Productions, with Alexandra Milchan and Scott Lambert for Emjag Productions, Guymon Casady (Entertainment 360), and Brooke Kennedy executive producing. 

 










XYZ Films will release “The Ritual” in theaters on Friday, June 6. Check out the trailer below.

Jon Hamm is bringing a “Mad Men” reunion to his latest collaboration with his “Wet Hot American Summer” director David Wain. Hamm will co-star alongside John Slattery (who also directed him in “Maggie Moore(s)”) for Wain's yet-untitled R-rated comedy. Hamm previously appeared in the spinoff miniseries “Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp.”

Wain cowrote the script with “Wet Hot American Summer” alum Ken Marino, who also stars in the film. Variety announced the feature as being described as an “off-the-rails odyssey through modern day Hollywood.” Zoey Deutch leads the movie as Midwestern bride-to-be Gail Daughtry whose fiancé lives out their celebrity hall pass agreement. Gail instead sets out to find her own celebrity to cheat on him with while visiting L.A. Sabrina Impacciatore, Ben Wang, and Miles Gutierrez-Riley also star.

The film is being produced by Anthony Bregman and Peter Cron for Likely Story, Crystine Zhang for Oval-5, and Wain, Marino, and Charles Zhong. Robert Herjavec, Chechen Dong, Tom Griffin, Amanda Chang, Adrian Politowski, Jamie Canniffe, Franny Baldwin, Hamm, Deutch, and Slattery will executive produce. WME Independent is representing worldwide sales.

“I have been excited about working with David for 25 years since I read what I thought was the funniest script of all time, ‘Wet Hot American Summer,'” producer Bregman said in a statement. “Now, years later, I am happy to now be working with him and Ken on the only script that's ever made me laugh harder.” 

Producer Zhang added, “I couldn't be more excited to bring this wildly fun story to life with such a brilliant team. Working with David Wain, Ken Marino and attaching this phenomenal cast — including Zoey Deutch, Jon Hamm and John Slattery — has been a dream come true. I can't wait for audiences to join us for this super wacky comedy with lots of heart.” 

The “Wet Hot American Summer” franchise was co-created by Wain and director Michael Showalter. The duo reunited for a sequel and a TV series adaptation of the 2001 cult film. 

“I came to a realization, and have over and over, over the years, just that: You could be making so much money, and your bank statement gets bigger and bigger, but if you're not psyched to go to work in the morning, it doesn't matter,” Wain told IndieWire at the time of selecting his collaborators. “It sucks. So you wanna just be psyched to see the people that you work with, and have fun with. Then you've won.”

Consider If You Asked for a Picture as the second chapter in an ongoing novel chronicling the trials and tribulations of life in your 20s. On Sabrina Teitelbaum's second album as Blondshell, which arrives two years after her eponymous debut, Teitelbaum is still haunted by the past and stumbling into the kinds of bad decisions that fueled Blondshell. Her head may be clouded by contradictions, yet here, she conveys these conflicted feelings in an increasingly confident, self-assured musical language.

That sense of impending clarity derives from an expanded soundscape of swirling, shape-shifting textures created by Teitelbaum and Yves Rothman, who reprises his role as producer from Blondshell. Opening track “Thumbtack” feels like the album in microcosm. What starts simple gets complicated quickly, as finger-picked acoustic guitars feint at folk before the song gets softer and richer, echoing the mellow breeze of yacht rock while retaining a nervy emotional center.

Teitelbaum remains rooted in the sound and sensibility of 1990s alt-rock, marrying the skeletal strums of lo-fi with billows of dream-pop harmonies and squalls of oversaturated guitars. Where her peers can occasionally seem mired in the moors of revivalism, Blondshell deploys these sounds in a painterly fashion, letting the fading echoes of her voice intertwine with decaying guitar distortion and occasionally puncturing her sighing melodies with shards of noise.

Throughout If You Asked for a Picture, Teitelbaum's affectless voice cuts through the enveloping fog of introspection. After spending a song perched between a murmur and a sigh, she'll unexpectedly deliver a lyrical barb, its bluntness emphasized by her lack of a vibrato. Again and again, she's sorting out the mess of romance, resigning herself to staying in a partnership for practical concerns (“I'll stick with you, 'cause I like sleeping well, she sings on “He Wants Me”). On “Man,” wondering if “a lot of wiggle room” and drugs are reason enough to be in a relationship, she describes herself as “a kid wanting to cancel.” But for most of If You Asked for a Picture, she's plagued by the immaturity of others. Often, she pictures herself in a maternal role, bearing the responsibility of parenting immature boyfriends. She flatters the subject of “Two Times” by singing “You'd be a good dad/You carried me to the bed,” a description that hits harder after hearing how the accidental lover of “T&A” “turned right from a man into a boy.”

Some of the album's parental imagery comes from a heavier place; Teitelbaum's mother died in 2018, and several songs appear to address their relationship. Over a crawling tempo that gains in intensity as guitar overdubs pile up, Teitelbaum flashes through adolescent memories on “Event of a Fire,” realizing if “part of me never left her in 2012/Part of me is still getting all of my haircuts for someone else.” The memories turn prickly on “What's Fair,” when she deliberately sours her empathy with pointed accusations, all delivered as a piece of urgent fuzz-pop. All this rumination builds to “23's A Baby,” where she asks a direct, spiky question: “23's a baby,” goes the chorus, “Why'd you have a baby?”

The painful truths of “23's A Baby” never feel anguished thanks to a persistent pop pulse. It's a trick Teitelbaum and Rothman pull off repeatedly throughout If You Asked for a Picture: The songs may arise from turmoil, but the production is enveloping and inviting, suggesting there's a path out of the darkness. The album's last track, “Model Rockets,” with its dreamy girl-group sway, cements this impression, pivoting on the line “The problem is I don't know what I want anymore.” The lyrics are born of confusion while the music is vivid and assured—a paradox that exemplifies Teitelbaum's emergence from her 20s bearing evident scars along with a stronger sense of self.

André 3000 has surprise-released a new instrumental project dubbed 7 Piano Sketches. As the name suggests, it's a seven-song collection that centers around piano, with the individual tracks prefaced by himself, Emmy Paalman, or Fatima Robinson reading off the song titles. Vocal effects and occasional samples, like a laugh track on “Off Rhythm Laughter,” also intermittently appear. Give it a listen below.

“The original title for it was The Best Worst Rap Album in History,” André 3000 said in a press release. “And here is an excerpt from the original liner notes: ‘It's jokingly the worst rap album in history because there are no lyrics on it at all. It's the best because it's the free-est emotionally and best I've felt personally. It's the best because it's like a palette cleanser for me.'”

Partially composed and recorded prior to New Blue Sun, 7 Piano Sketches first took shape nearly a decade ago when André 3000 stayed in a sparse Texas house with his son that only had a piano, two beds, and a few TV screens. “Having lived with the recordings for a time, André was drawn to the idea of creating more and sharing them in the Spring, a time of year that promises that life, creativity, and possibility are ever-renewing,” a press release elaborates.

It's no coincidence that André 3000 dropped this new project late at night. He timed the release to align with his appearance at the 2025 Met Gala in New York, where he wore a bespoke piano by Burberry on his back, in collaboration with Benji Bixby—an evolution of Benjamin Bixby, André 3000's late aughts fashion line—and styled by Law Roach. His outfit appears to align with the illustration on the 7 Piano Sketches's cover artwork.

7 Piano Sketches is André 3000's first new music since releasing the flute-focused album New Blue Sun in 2023. That served as the Outkast rapper's debut solo LP, and it earned him three Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year. The 2024 short film Moving Day, directed by Dexter Navy, documented the making of New Blue Sun and included a previously unreleased track from those recording sessions.

Meg Remy has announced a new U.S. Girls album: Scratch It, the follow-up to 2023's Bless This Mess, is out June 20 via 4AD. The new album's lead single is the 12-minute “Bookends.” Watch the track's music video below. Scroll down for U.S. Girls' upcoming tour dates.

Remy co-wrote “Bookends” with Edwin de Goeji. The song is a tribute to the late Power Trip singer Riley Gale. And, discussing the music video, director Caity Arthur stated: “The video is ultimately about death and absolution—how death is one of the only certain things in life; the ‘great equalizer,' nolens volens. However, it also subverts the traditional narrative of death as a despairing void, rather, portraying it as a euphoric transitory experience or new beginning through a hallucinatory ensemble cast, a 1960s pop-star performance, and sleight of hand magic. As the video progresses, the TV channels alternate through these scenes as Meg's lyrics evoke death in its various forms.”

Remy made Scratch it with guitarist Dillon Watson, bassist Jack Lawrence, drummer Domo Donoho, keyboardists Jo Schornikow and Tina Norwood, and harmonica player Charlie McCoy. They recorded the album over the course of 10 days.

Jon Voight confirmed that he “brought forward recommendations” to President Donald Trump for tariffs on movies made outside the U.S.


	After Trump announced he is authorizing the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative to start the process for enacting a 100 percent tariff on American films that are produced in “foreign lands,” it was speculated that Voight was responsible. Now the actor has released a short video describing his intentions. 


	“I recently met with our president, Donald J. Trump, who loves the entertainment business,” Voight says in the video, posted to his account on X and titled “Plan to rescue Hollywood.” “[He] wants to see Hollywood thrive and make films bigger and greater than ever before, as he says, and see productions come back to American Hollywood. The Hollywood that I fell in love with when I was a child and was honored to contribute to during my career. Our industry recently has suffered greatly over these past few years, and many Americans have lost jobs to productions that have gone overseas. It's been very serious. People have people have lost their homes. Can't feed their families.”

	











	He continued, “After meeting with many of the entertainment leaders, I have brought forward recommendations to the president for certain tax provisions that can help the industry. Some provisions that could be extended and others that could be revived or instituted. This would help the movie and television production and our beloved theaters that are so important to the American family experience.”

	Voight further outlined his plans in a press release sent Monday by a representative for Voight and his business partner Steven Paul. It involves a combination of federal tax incentives, tax code changes, co-production treaties, and infrastructure subsidies for theater owners, production, and postproduction companies, per The Hollywood Reporter. 


	Notably, the press release only briefly mentioned tariffs, calling for “tariffs in certain limited circumstances,” not the 100 percent on all foreign films that Trump announced. The plan comes from months of meetings between Voight, his team, and entertainment stakeholders, including studios, streamers, and guilds. Voight and Paul confirmed that they met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend, and said the White House is “reviewing” their proposals.

	Voight, a longtime Trump supporter, was named as one of Trump's “special ambassadors” to Hollywood earlier this year alongside Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone. “These three very talented people will be my eyes and ears, and I will get done what they suggest,” Trump said at the time. “It will again be, like the United States of America itself, the Golden Age of Hollywood!”


	Those themes were echoed in Trump's announcement of the murky film tariff plan on Sunday. The president said he was authorizing 100 percent tariffs on films produced in “foreign lands,” also known as runaway productions. Trump called these productions a “national security threat” and claimed they're causing the film industry to die “a very fast death.”

	“Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding: “This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!” 


	It is true that film jobs, especially in California, have declined significantly in recent years because of high production costs and fewer incentives. While many productions have moved to other parts of the United States (like Atlanta), they've also gone abroad thanks to lucrative incentives offered by countries like the U.K. and Canada. But many films also shoot overseas for creative, not economic, reasons, and ostensibly these films would also be hit with the 100 percent if implemented.

Pete Hegseth has already displayed a predictable lack of competence in his role as defense secretary, but it's not just a sloppy use of Signal chats that has forced the White House to do damage control on his behalf. According to a Tuesday report from Reuters, early in his tenure Hegseth cancelled military aid to Ukraine without a direct order from President Donald Trump. 


	The pause, which Hegseth ordered just days after Trump was sworn in, led the U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) to ground 11 flights moving weapons and artillery to Ukraine. According to Reuters, when Ukrainian and Polish officials reached out to the White House to ask what was going on, officials in the Pentagon, State Department, and the president's office caught unaware that any such pause had been ordered. 


	Records reviewed by Reuters showed that Hegseth had given a verbal order to halt the weapons shipments shortly after attending an Oval Office meeting where cutting military aid to Ukraine was discussed — but not ordered. The order was quickly reversed, and until now the incident was effectively hushed away. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The White House claimed that Hegseth had followed a directive from Trump aligned with the administration's policy towards Ukraine at that time, but other sources who spoke to Reuters and were aware of the events as they unfolded said U.S. National Security Officials and others who would typically be involved in such a decision had no idea the order had been made. 


	It's another instance in which sloppy communication problems — either in excess or absence — have caused embarrassment to the defense secretary and the administration. Hegseth was already in hot water after revelations that he shared sensitive attack plans against Houthi rebels in Yemen in two Signal group chats. According to a Monday report from The Wall Street Journal, Hegseth has used Signal — which is only approved for extremely limited, unclassified communication use by the Pentagon — much more extensively than previously known.

	Sources who spoke to the WSJ say the defense secretary has made over a dozen Signal chats to discuss all manner of DOD policy and issues with relevant parties — including representatives from foreign governments and partner nations. According to the sources, Hegseth has used Signal to discuss potentially sensitive information both on his personal phone, and on unsecure lines in the Pentagon. In other instances, it's Marine Col. Ricky Buria — a Hegseth aide — who posts information onto Hegseth's Signal chats on his behalf. Buria was, according to sources, the individual who posed air strike plans against the Houthis in a chat with Hegseth's wife and brother.

	











	The Department of Defense has invested vast fortunes in the creation of secure internal and external communications networks to protect against intentional and inadvertent leaks, or outright hacking and espionage. Hegseth, however, seems to prefer the convenience of a third-party application. Aides and others the secretary messages via Signal told the WSJ that they're sometimes forced to go away from their desks and hunt for a place within the Pentagon where they get enough cell service to respond on the application. 


	The Pentagon will continue to exist in a state of uncertainty so long as Hegseth is at its helm. On Monday, the defense secretary ordered that the number of four-star generals and admirals in the military be cut by 20 percent across the board.

	“Secretary Hegseth has shown an eagerness to dismiss military leaders without cause, and I will be skeptical of the rationale for these plans until he explains them before the Armed Services Committee,” Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told NBC News.


	Trump has repeatedly insisted he's sticking by Hegseth, despite all of the controversy. He told The Atlantic recently that he's spoken to Hegseth about his issues, and that he's confident the man he put in charge of the United States military will “get it toegether.”

	The Baltimore Ravens announced Monday that they are releasing kicker Justin Tucker from the team. The news arrives after multiple massage therapists accused Tucker of sexually inappropriate behavior in a report published by The Baltimore Banner months prior.


	Executive Vice President and General Manager Eric DeCosta addressed the release in a statement shared on Monday. “Sometimes football decisions are incredibly difficult, and this is one of those instances,” said DeCosta. “Considering our current roster, we have made the tough decision to release Justin Tucker.” DeCosta made no mention of the accusations in his statement.


	In January, six Baltimore-area massage therapists accused Tucker of sexual misconduct in an investigation published by The Baltimore Banner. The following month, three more therapists — all of whom were employed at Baltimore luxury spa The QG — claimed that they had similar encounters with the All-Pro placekicker.


	Tucker, 35, who had been with the team since 2012, previously denied the allegations and in a lengthy social media post, called them “unequivocally false.” Tucker said that he'd “never before been accused of misconduct of anytime” and claimed the Banner was “deliberately misconstruing events as nefarious,” while calling the newspaper's report “desperate tabloid fodder.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“I maintain I did not act inappropriately at any point before, during, or after a professional bodywork treatment session,” Tucker wrote at the time. “I would never intend to offend or hurt anyone, ever.”

	His attorneys Thomas A. Clare and Steven J. Harrison also previously denied the claims to the Banner, stating that Tucker “has never behaved inappropriately during any massage therapy session, and certainly never in the manner described.”  


	The Raven's announcement comes a day after its head coach John Harbaugh said the NFL was still investigating misconduct allegations against Tucker and that any decisions the team made about the kicker “would be based on football.”

A former NASA flight surgeon has spoken out for the first time about a classified sighting he claims to have witnessed more than 30 years ago.

Dr. Gregory Rogers, who served as NASA's Chief Flight Surgeon and a U.S. Air Force major, revealed to the Daily Mail that in 1992 he viewed security footage of what he described as a 20-foot ""flying saucer"" inside a Cape Canaveral hangar.

Rogers said he kept quiet for over three decades but decided to come forward following his recent retirement from the Department of Defense.

Rogers' claims add to a growing number of accounts suggesting the U.S. military has secretly developed or recovered advanced aerial technology. He said the craft he observed appeared seamless, with no visible rivets or seams, and demonstrated movement capabilities beyond known human aviation technology.

""I know exactly what I saw that day,"" Rogers told the Daily Mail. ""It was in no fashion a conventional flying vehicle.""

He stated that his decision was motivated by ongoing testimonies from other military whistleblowers who allege the U.S. government has recovered alien craft.

According to Rogers, he was shown the footage by another Air Force major who approached him unprompted while he was inspecting facilities.

The major locked a room and displayed a video feed showing the saucer-shaped object levitating. The craft was surrounded by personnel in lab coats and hazmat suits.

He added that the craft tilted in a way that indicated it did not rely on traditional propulsion methods, as there were no visible jets or propellers.

""All of a sudden it just lifted up, as smooth as could be,"" Rogers said in his interview with the Daily Mail. ""It rotated clockwise, then counterclockwise, and tilted 45 degrees while hovering.""

The vehicle bore ""U.S. Air Force"" markings, which Rogers found startling. ""I'm thinking, this is ours? Someone had to design and manufacture the vehicle I saw on that video.""

Rogers also claimed that astronauts he worked with during his NASA tenure confided that they too had witnessed UFOs during space missions, and that funding for such a craft should have been disclosed to Congress. However, he declined to name the other astronauts, citing stigma within the space community.

Rogers' decision to speak publicly follows similar disclosures by other former officials. In 2023, former intelligence officer David Grusch testified to Congress about a secret crash retrieval and reverse engineering program.

""Other whistleblowers have given their own testimony to Congress...I am simply adding my voice,"" Rogers said.

On social media, Reddit users on r/UFOs have shared a range of reactions to Rogers' disclosure. Some expressed skepticism, questioning the timing of the revelation and the lack of corroborating evidence.

Others found the account compelling, noting that Rogers' credentials as a former NASA Chief Flight Surgeon lend credibility to his claims. A few users speculated about the implications of such technology potentially being in the possession of the U.S. Air Force, while others called for more transparency and further investigation.

Reacting to the interview, one user said: ""This is interesting! Also I find it kind of hilarious that anyone willing to break their silence would choose to do so on some weird YouTube paranormal conspiracy channel.""

Another viewer said: ""Ask any decent intel or opsec person - the best place to get a read on the street is the gossip pages and rags. Culture is usually blindly obvious, especially in the locally published stuff.

""I could put it another way - should he have gone to which major media outlet that you trust in America right now? In times of turmoil, read the graffiti.""

Now retired, Rogers has joined the board of the International UFO Bureau (IUFOB), a nonprofit that investigates unidentified aerial phenomena. He hopes his testimony will encourage others to come forward.

A scientist has worked out how visible we are in the cosmos","https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/how-far-away-aliens-detect-life-on-earth","Tue, 06 May 2025 08:45:30 GMT","



Lewis Dartnell

The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) is interested in finding alien civilisations by detecting signs of their activity.

The use of radio telescopes to listen out for alien broadcasts dates back to the 1960s, but SETI researchers also look for evidence of enormous engineering projects.

For example, an alien civilisation might construct a thin shell around its host star to harvest energy.

Such a ‘Dyson sphere' ought to be detectable as a warm source of infrared rays without a corresponding visible light source.

Astronomers have looked for these telltale signatures but haven't found any.

Many of these ‘technosignatures' discussed by SETI researchers relate only to advanced civilisations, far beyond our current level of technological ability.

Sofia Sheikh, at the SETI Institute, California, and her colleagues are interested in a slightly different question.

How far away would Earth be detectable as harbouring an intelligent species, using only the technology we have today?

As the authors put it: ""One could imagine a spaceship loaded with all of humanity's best modern-day instruments, launched towards a mirror image of Earth – which present-day technosignatures would be detectable first?""

They look at a range of possible technosignatures: radio emissions; bright lasers shone into the sky; and changes to Earth's atmospheric composition from agricultural and industrial activity. 

Starting with radio emissions, the team calculated that if we beamed a signal with the intention of making contact, we'd be able to detect ourselves from around 12,000 lightyears away.

Of course, as attempts such as the 1974 Arecibo message have only been sent in the last century, any signals won't have had time to make it nearly that far yet.

Meanwhile, inadvertent leaking of much weaker radio waves into outer space, from mobile phone towers or television broadcasts, would be detectable from four lightyears away – only as far as the nearest star to us.

Indicators of Earth's industrial activity in the atmosphere could be detected from slightly further away.

While nitrogen dioxide is produced by lightning and some biological processes on Earth, huge amounts of it are also released by human industrial activity: mainly vehicle engines and fossil-fuelled power stations.

Atmospheric nitrogen dioxide peaked in 1980 at levels that ought to be detectable from 5.7 lightyears away with the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), a space telescope due to launch in the 2040s. 

Light pollution is a big problem for astronomers in built-up areas, so might this urban technosignature be detectable?

Many cities are lit by the yellowy light from high-pressure sodium lamps, and this is particularly spectroscopically distinctive.

Sheikh's team calculates that a telescope like the HWO could detect this artificial light from around 2,300 AU, where 1 AU is the Earth–Sun distance – an alien probe would need to be within the inner edge of our Solar System's Oort cloud to see our nighttime cities. 

Sheikh and her colleagues conclude that Earth is most detectable through radio emissions.

They stress that there are good reasons to not expect an extraterrestrial civilisation to have reachedexactly the same technological level as us, but this work does help focus attention on what sort of technosignatures we might be able to detect on exoplanets.

Predictions about the end of the world are not uncommon, ranging from asteroid collisions to AI domination to environmental collapse. But one particularly startling claim comes from Calvin Parker, a man from Mississippi, the United States, who said he was abducted by aliens not once, but twice.

In a newly resurfaced interview, Parker recalled that the extraterrestrials warned him that humans themselves would bring about the end of the world.

Parker first made headlines in 1973, when he and a companion, Charles Hickson, claimed they were taken aboard a UFO while fishing along the Pascagoula River. At the time, the incident drew significant media attention in the United States, though the scientific community largely remained silent. While Hickson continued to speak publicly about the event, Parker stayed quiet for years, until a second, voluntary encounter in 1992.

In the 1992 meeting, which took place in Baldwin, Louisiana, Parker claimed that the aliens allowed him aboard their craft and shared dire warnings. “There's no need to fear us; fear your own people who are destroying the world,"" one alien reportedly told him. Parker added that the aliens were collecting crops and soil samples, just as they had in 1973.

According to Parker, the alien also said, “I will give you proof and try to change it,"" which deeply disturbed him. It was only years later, shortly before his death in 2023, that Parker shared the full story with author Philip Mantle, leading to the release of three books. A video interview, recently uncovered, has now gone viral on the internet, reigniting public interest in his experiences.

Parker urged humanity to reflect and change its ways, warning that continued environmental harm such as deforestation and pollution would eventually lead to global catastrophe. “We cannot go on living like this,"" he said, adding that a small alien creature seemed more intelligent than humans.

Mantle, who documented Parker's story, said the sincerity with which Parker told his tale struck a chord. The Pascagoula encounter remains one of America's most compelling UFO cases, and this newly surfaced interview has added a fresh layer to its enduring mystery.","{'href': 'https://www.news18.com', 'title': 'News18'}","other"

At every level of government, authority figures are embracing once-extreme ideas, including that the Earth is flat or that the state controls the weather.

Tiffany Hsu covers disinformation and conspiracy theories.

People who question whether the Earth is round — a fact understood by the ancient Greeks and taught to American children in elementary school — might have been political pariahs a decade ago. Now, they're running local Republican parties in Georgia and Minnesota and seeking public office in Alabama.

A prominent far-right activist who has said, despite years of research and intelligence establishing otherwise, that the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, were an inside job by the U.S. government commemorated the 9/11 anniversary last year alongside President Trump.

And Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, pledged the agency's support last month for a fight involving so-called chemtrails, a debunked theory that the white condensation lines streaming behind airplanes are toxic, or could even be used for nefarious purposes.

Conspiracy theories that were relegated to random and often anonymous online forums are now being championed or publicly debated by increasingly powerful people. Mr. Trump in particular has embraced, elevated and even appointed to his cabinet people promoting these theories — giving the ideas a persuasive authority and a dangerous proximity to policy.

“The real problem with the ideas and the communication of conspiracy theories is when they get evinced by people with the power to act on them,” said Joseph E. Uscinski, a professor at the University of Miami who studies conspiracy theories. “If some guy, somewhere, thinks the Earth is flat, the answer is ‘So what?' But when people in power have those beliefs, it becomes a serious issue.”

He added: “You can wind up harming many, many people over a fantasy.”

Anna Kelly, a spokeswoman for the White House, said in a statement that the mainstream media “has tried and failed to paint President Trump as extreme for his entire political career” and that his agenda was “common sense.”

Less than two minutes into the movie, the narrator makes a shocking claim. 

“The evidence we are about to present to you has the potential to rewrite thousands of years of human history. It will present evidence that suggests ancient serpent or lizard-like aliens came to earth thousands of years ago,” the narrator says. “We'll also present evidence that these ancient aliens are still among us today.” 

This bizarre narrative echoes a paranoia about shadowy reptilians that has persisted for decades on the absolute fringes of the conspiracy theory movement. However, in this case, the story of “serpent or lizard-like aliens” who are secretly wielding influence over the human race isn't coming from some pamphlet or dark corner of the internet. It is among the most watched films available for streaming on a service run by a multibillion dollar media company that is owned by the President of the United States. 

When they launched a streaming service last year, President Trump's business partners at the Trump Media and Technology Group announced it would be focused on “news, Christian content, and family friendly programming that is uncancellable by Big Tech.” Yet this supposed haven for young viewers and wholesome Christian fare is also home to “Lizard People: Rulers of Time and Space,” a bizarre hour-long movie that presents claims that there is a race of “serpent-like aliens who created humans and the religious systems used to control them.” As of this writing, Trump's company is marketing this to viewers as a “documentary” — and it's not the only one on their platform filled with shocking statements linking Christianity and other faiths to shadowy, sinister alien conspiracies. 

These ideas are easy to dismiss as utterly and obviously ridiculous. However, they have a history of attracting troubled believers on the furthest conspiracy fringe. And, while these movies are available on other streaming platforms, in this case the sitting president's nascent media empire is playing a role in the promotion of this extreme content. Trump's streaming service also seems to have helped it to find an audience. On Monday and through much of last week, “Lizard People” was listed among the top 10 “most watched” programs on the streaming service. 

This service and some of its more unhinged offerings is effectively the underbelly of one of the more prominent features of the new Trump era — Truth Social. 

Throughout his second re-election campaign and first hundred days back in office, President Trump has used the Truth Social platform to issue near constant updates including policy pronouncements, personnel announcements, attacks on his political enemies, and even musings on last month's NFL Draft. The site serves a quasi-official role with Trump's “truths” sometimes also being distributed by the official White House Office of Communications. Truth Social was launched in early 2022 after Trump was banned from multiple more mainstream sites following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The platform is the centerpiece of Trump Media & Technology Group, a company that is majority owned by the president and that has extensive ties to his current administration. 

More recently, as Trump's media empire has made headlines for quickly losing and raising massive sums of cash, it has expanded beyond social networking into other forms of entertainment. Now, the company's ventures include Truth+, the streaming service with multiple films being marketed as documentaries that present wild conspiracy theories, including allegations alien beings are “manipulating world events and are using religion and other means to secretly control humanity.”

TPM reached out to TMTG for comment on this surprising fare. Spokeswoman Shannon Devine responded on the company's behalf with a note that wove its own dramatic tale of nefarious plotting by shadowy forces.

“Having trafficked in absurd conspiracy theories for years, the partisan hacks at Talking Points Memo, at the behest of their leftwing puppet masters, turn around and demand we censor content on our free-speech platform,” Devine said.

TMTG, which is also known as “Trump Media,” has had what one analyst described to the UK's Telegraph newspaper as a “wild ride largely fueled by Donald Trump's political influence.” TMTG was started in 2021 by Trump and two former contestants on his reality show, “The Apprentice.” The relationship between Trump and the other founders eventually descended into lawsuits as the company underwent a merger and prepared to go public. TMTG, which trades under the symbol “DJT,” had its IPO in March 2024 at an $8 billion valuation. Since then, the stock has been on a rollercoaster ride, with prices climbing above $60 after the initial offering before coming down to, as of last week, roughly $25. 

Having a publicly traded media company means Trump, who owns a majority of the DJT shares, is in a position to rake in sums from individual advertisers and investors at a level that is unprecedented for a sitting president. After winning the 2024 election, Trump placed his stake in the company into a revocable trust solely managed by his son, Donald Trump Jr., who is also on the company's board. The president isn't the only official who has been in a position to cash in on the company. Other members of the Trump administration have also held shares or served on TMTG's board. TMTG's CEO and chairman is Devin Nunes, who is a former Republican congressman and the current chair of the President's Intelligence Advisory board.

TMTG's high value has, thus far, been at odds with steep losses that have dwarfed the company's revenues and totaled over $400 million last year. Stock sales have helped Trump Media offset that and close out 2024 with a $777 million cash reserve. However, even with those assets, the company appears to be searching for ways to expand its business model. Truth+, which includes a streaming service, launched last August and has been framed by Nunes as central to those efforts.

In an April 29 letter to shareholders, Nunes described several potential revenue streams from Truth+, including a crypto token and “premium features” for subscribers like a verified “red check badge.” Nunes reiterated the message that the streaming service would focus on the family and people of faith.

“We're assessing various means of monetizing the Truth+ platform, including through advertising and a subscription package with premium content,” Nunes wrote. “Meanwhile, we are continuing our efforts to secure new programming encompassing family-friendly entertainment, documentaries, children's shows, Christian content, and unbiased news broadcasts.”

The current slate of streamable video on Truth+ includes rebroadcasts of shows from the right-wing cable network “Real America's Voice” and disgraced former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. Along with partisan news, there are also documentaries, religious programming, and movies including some that are clearly labeled “sci fi, “fantasy,” and “horror.” Among these offerings are multiple shows that veer towards the extreme and conspiratorial.

While other Truth+ programming is categorized with entertainment genres, as of this writing, the full description on the service identifies “Lizard People” simply as a “documentary” that poses a tantalizing, troubling question: “Did ancient serpent or Lizard-like aliens come to Earth thousands of years ago to play a role in creating humanity and are they still among us today?” 

Viewers who are intrigued by this pitch and opt to watch are treated to a brief “WARNING” noting “some parts of this film may be objectionable or offensive and may contain triggers for post traumatic stress disorder, for some viewers.” The disclaimer also declares “the views and opinions expressed in this film are entirely those of its makers.” Other than that, the hour-long show contains no effort to question or downplay any of the shocking claims contained therein. Instead, the deep-voiced narrator repeatedly and authoritatively suggests the film's claims all may be true.

“There is a great deal of evidence to suggest that alien, serpent-like creatures did come to Earth thousands of years ago and created religion, humanity, and continue to control us even now,” the narrator says at one point.

Along with the dramatic narration, “Lizard People” includes a compilation from various stock footage and image libraries along with computer animations. The “evidence” presented resists basic scrutiny, as it largely lacks citations and consists of sweeping statements about ancient art, culture, and more modern alien encounters. While the premise and bizarre presentation ensure that remotely discerning audiences would dismiss the film's claims, they are continually presented as wholly factual research supported in part by the assertions of federal government agencies.

“With every passing day, NASA tells us that they have discovered yet another earth-like planet that could sustain life,” the “Lizard People” narrator states near the end of the show, adding, “They alter their equations on the existence of alien life on a weekly basis. Even they are growing more and more aware that soon they will discover something special. The question is, will we awaken the ancient invaders and will they return — if they're not already here?”

Those comments directly give way to some of the more shocking imagery that appears in the climax of the hour-long film. As “Lizard People” enters its final minutes, footage plays across the screen showing grey alien figures standing over a nearly nude man splayed out on a table surrounded by machinery and tubes prodding into his flesh.

Against this backdrop, the narrator declares: “The fact is, these serpent aliens may use more than space to appear on earth. They may also use time.” The footage gives way to images of human bodies suspended in pods and a suggestion that proof for all of this lies in tales of titans in “Greek mythology,” the story of the serpent and the Garden of Eden in the “Christian Bible,” and more modern disclosures about unexplained alien phenomena. This blend of strange imagery, ancient lore, and UFOlogy transitions to the movie's final argument. 

“In conclusion, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that ancient serpent aliens still visit earth and also use time travel,” the narrator says as the screen goes dark.

Variations of the claim that reptilian extraterrestrials have played an influential and sometimes sinister role in world history have been promoted by conspiracy theorists for well over a hundred years. Researcher Logan Strain, who has written about conspiracy theories for the Washington Post and covers the topic in depth for the podcast “QAA,” which he co-hosts pseudonymously as “Travis View,” told TPM the phenomenon can be traced as far back as the 19th century occultist writer Helena Blavatsky. 

“She wrote about ancient civilizations that influenced the modern day, and ancient lost races,” Strain explained. Blavatsky theorized an ancient race of dragon men. These claims, Strain said, “were later adopted by conspiracists.”

”But what really got it kicked off was a couple things,” he continued. “Robert E. Howard, who wrote the Conan the Barbarian series — he wrote some fiction about lizard people. This was picked up by a cult leader named Maurice Doreal.”

Doreal, Strain explained, wrote a pamphlet entitled The Mysteries of Gobi that described a civilization beneath the desert. “He claimed that there was an ancient race of lizard people,” Strain said. “So, this was like from the 1940s.” 

Strain described reptilian theories, today, as “more fringe than QAnon.”

“There are more people who believe fringe conspiracy theories about the faked moon landing and stuff than lizard people,” Strain said. “It is a very fringe, minority conspiracist belief in a land where people feel free to believe lots of wild things.”

While the number of people convinced of a dark reptilian influence may be small, Strain pointed out belief in lizard people has been linked to multiple incidents of real world violence.

“This is such a wild, out-there belief, if someone espouses this belief and sincerely believes this, it signals, usually, some kind of an instability or mental illness,” said Strain. “There've been multiple examples of people who promote conspiracy belief, who've committed violence or committed suicide in a spectacular way.” 

The lizard people conspiracy is also, as Strain put it, “very heavily intertwined with anti-Semitic tropes” and the idea Jews are among the sinister, elite forces operating behind the scenes. Strain noted that the idea that reptilians are manipulating the world was “really popularized” more recently by the prominent British footballer-turned-conspiracy theorist David Icke. While Icke denies being an anti-Semite, his past statements — including blaming Jewish groups for COVID — have led him to be banned from multiple countries and internet platforms. 

The film “Lizard People” does not include focused criticism of Jews. However, the movie and another on Trump's Truth+ platform include bizarre and conspiratorial statements about multiple religions. In “Lizard People,” the narrator suggests the “very children of Israel” engaged in “intermarriage” with “serpent worshippers.”

“This is very revealing,” the narrator declares. “Intermarriage and worship of the serpent gods. Today, we can easily replace the word ‘gods' with aliens.”

The movie also includes some inflammatory commentary about the Catholic Church. 

“The Vatican comes from the words ‘vatis' for prophet and ‘can' for serpent, making the Vatican a place of serpent prophecy,” the narrator says. “The very book of Christians across the world, The Bible, is full of the serpent.” 

Most etymologists explicitly do not agree with this interpretation of the term “Vatican.”

Another film on Truth+ delves more specifically into the idea that major religions are part of an extraterrestrial conspiracy. “Conspiracy Chronicles: Dark Underworld” has also been described on the service as a “documentary.” 

“Explore the powerful, secret underworld of a shocking coalition of the human elite and advanced beings not of this world dating back hundreds of years,” the description says.

Like “Lizard People,” “Conspiracy Chronicles” is approximately one hour long and seemingly wholly made up of ominous narration set against stock footage and computer animation. It begins with a disclaimer that says “the views expressed in this film are not necessarily the views of … any other person involved in the making and distribution of this film.” There is no other attempt to downplay the claims in the movie or indicate they have no basis in reality. 

And “Conspiracy Chronicles” may be even weirder than the reptilian saga, as it includes a rapidfire smorgasbord of wild claims about everything from Freemasonry to the Jesuits to the Moon, which it contends is actually  “hollowed out” and a “base for aliens.” 

“Power cleverly shifts around, but always at the very top, the same families run the world,” the “Conspiracy Chronicles” narrator declares at one point, quickly adding, “The modern era of mind control began with the creation of the Illuminati.” 

“Conspiracy Chronicles” also goes beyond the rhetoric of “Lizard People.” Rather than simply posing religion as a tool for nefarious forces to control the populace, it suggests the Judeochristian God and other religious leaders including the Hindu deity Krishna are actually extraterrestrials themselves. 

“There are a few pieces of evidence that suggest that Jesus may have been an alien,” the narrator says before going deeper down the rabbit hole. “And what about other religious originators such as Buddha? … He wasn't human. He was an alien. So, the next time you see a statue of Buddha, remember that he was an alien.”

The array of theories in “Conspiracy Chronicles” also include some suggesting the U.S. government is part of a scheme to cover up both UFOs and “dark ops” experiments. According to the film, this secret laboratory work includes “deliberate production of utterly abominable results such as ape-human embryos and other ungodly biological combinations.” The movie outlines an especially disturbing scenario that it links to a military base in New Mexico. 

“One of the most horrifying claims made for this installation was the presence of the so-called ‘blood lab' where various kinds of blood, both natural and synthetic, was processed ostensibly for the consumption of the extraterrestrials who required it for their existence,” the narrator says. 

Perhaps the most surprising aspect of these claims of government involvement in unnatural experiments and alien blood sacrifice is that they are being streamed on a service owned by the president of the United States. The White House did not respond to a request for comment asking if Trump thinks this content is in line with his company's values. They also didn't answer specific questions about whether Trump believes in “lizard-like” aliens or if the government is covering up UFOs or human-animal breeding experiments.  

There is other conspiratorial content on Truth+ including a film on the “Illuminati” that was also, as of last week, among the services “most watched” videos. However, “Lizard People” and “Conspiracy Chronicles: Dark Underworld” stand out as truly bizarre in both their claims and presentation. Alchemy Werks LLC is identified as the production company behind both films on IMDB pages that are also linked on Truth+. “Lizard People” also cites Alchemy Werks in its credits. The company says on its website that it has produced dozens of movies about aliens that it bills as “reality films.” “Conspiracy Chronicles” additionally describes itself in its credits as a production of American River Media Group, a company that also advertises THC “horse treats.” When TPM reached out to these businesses, we received a call back from a man who identified himself as Charles Thompsen, who is credited as a producer on both “Lizard People” and “Conspiracy Chronicles: Dark Underworld.” 

Thompsen pointed to the disclaimers on both films, which state that the filmmakers do not vouch for the “accuracy” or “completeness” of the claims presented. The disclaimer on “Lizard People” also states that the filmmakers are “not responsible or liable for any action or inaction by a viewer of this video that is based on the content of this film.”

“I don't know how you could take ‘Lizard People' seriously, honestly,” Thompsen said. He went on to compare the films to “Dungeons and Dragons” and other fantasy entertainment.

“We have nothing but support for President Trump,” he said. “They should be noted that the genres are sci-fi and there's a big base that enjoys movies about aliens and lizard people and such. They're insatiable about it.”

Thompsen suggested he would talk with Truth+ about having his movies marked as “sci-fi/fantasy.”

“Unfortunately, they're not being denoted as such on the Trump Media site and I'm going to have to look into that,” he said.

In the days since, the label on “Conspiracy Chronicles: Dark Underworld” has been switched from “documentary” to “sci-fi” on Truth+. As of this writing, “Lizard People: Rulers of Time and Space” is still identified as a “documentary.”  

Conspiracy inflected plots are, of course, not uncommon in mainstream entertainment. Films, books and television including “The Da Vinci Code,” the “National Treasure” film series starring Nicolas Cage, and “The X Files” have long included clearly fictionalized storylines that delved into elements of popular conspiracy theories. While it is more rooted in conspiracy theories than any actual evidence, the idea that aliens played a role in early human history has also spawned relatively mainstream content that straddles the line between faux news and tongue-in-cheek entertainment. Specifically, the series “Ancient Aliens” has earned meme infamy while being broadcast on the “History Channel” and Netflix. 

However, the conspiratorial “documentary” content that is popular on Truth+ is different, in part because it leans into the version of this mythos that frames the ancient extraterrestrials as “lizard-like” serpents. This reptilian take on the theme has historically been one of the most extreme versions of the belief that aliens played a pivotal role in human history. Strain, the conspiracy theory researcher, suggested it is particularly troubling to see lizard people conspiracy theories advanced on a platform owned by Trump because the presidential association could give these wild ideas momentum. He alluded to instances where Trump has engaged with followers of another popular conspiracy theory, QAnon, online and off. 

“One of the reasons that QAnon spread so far and was so adopted is because Trump and some of his close associates were willing to sort of wink and nod at the QAnon community and make no effort to denounce them or denounce their beliefs,” Strain said. “That obviously fueled a lot of QAnon believers.”

Both “Lizard People” and “Conspiracy Chronicles” are also available on YouTube, Amazon Prime and other streaming services. However, at least on Amazon Prime, “Lizard People” is clearly identified as “science fiction.”

Other movies on Truth+ similarly come from companies that have dozens of little-known productions and that also make those films available on both free and paid streaming services. The fact these movies are simultaneously available from multiple different sources at widely varying price points brings up another question: How is it cost effective for producers to make dozens and dozens of movies? What exactly are they selling if these things are widely available and, in some cases, free?

TPM reached out to Richard Rushfield, a longtime chronicler of Hollywood and columnist at the entertainment industry site The Ankler, to try and understand this business model. There are various production companies who churn out work in bulk, at a low cost, and are then able to monetize even relatively small audiences via the internet or streaming, he said. He described it as a sub-Hollywood “weird internet” world and “very sort of bottom-feedery business.”

“It's like the mud at the bottom of the floor,” he said. “It's like living at that level.”

TPM asked Rushfield if it surprised him to see a company owned by the president engage with this type of content.

“Three months ago, it would have,” Rushfield said with a laugh. ”I don't know that I have the capacity for surprise any more.”

Plans are underway to create new AI-powered drones that can fly for much longer than current designs.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Scientists are developing an artificial intelligence (AI) chip the size of a grain of rice that can mimic human brains — and they plan to use it in miniature drones.

Although AI can automate monotonous functions, it is resource-intensive and requires large amounts of energy to operate. Drones also require energy for propulsion, navigation, sensing, stabilization and communication.

Larger drones can better compensate for AI's energy demands by using an engine, but smaller drones rely on battery power — meaning AI energy demands can reduce flying time from 45 minutes to just four.

But this may not be a problem forever., Suin Yi and his team at the University of Texas have been awarded funding by the 2025 Air Force Office of Scientific Research Young Investigator Program (part of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research) to develop an energy-efficient AI for drones. Their goal is to build a chip the size of a grain of rice with various AI capabilities — including autonomous piloting and object recognition — within three years.

To build a more energy-efficient AI chip, the scientists propose using conducting polymer thin films. These are (so far) an underused aspect of neuromorphic computing; this is a computer system that mimics the brain's structure to enable highly efficient information processing.

The researchers intend to replicate how neurons learn and make decisions, thereby saving energy by only being used when required, similar to how a human brain uses different parts for different functions.

Although neuromorphic computing was first proposed by scientist Carver Mead in the late 1980s, it is a field of computer design theory that is still in development. In 2024, Intel unveiled their Hala Point neuromorphic computer, which is powered by more than 1,000 new AI chips and performs 50 times faster than conventional computing systems.

Meanwhile, the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center develops AI software and neuromorphic hardware. Their particular focus is on developing systems for sharing all sensor information with every member of a network of neuromorphic-enabled units. This technology could allow for greater situational awareness, with applications so far including headsets and robotics.

Using technology developed through this research, drones could become more intelligent by integrating conducting polymer material systems that can function like neurons in a brain.

If Yi's research project is successful, miniature drones could become increasingly intelligent. An AI system using neuromorphic computing could allow smaller and smarter automated drones to be developed to provide remote monitoring in confined locations, with a much longer flying time.

Follow:


            Israel struck multiple sites in Yemen's capital Sanaa Tuesday, including the main airport, which the Israeli military said has now been “fully” disabled.
    


            “A short while ago, IDF (Israel Defense Forces) fighter jets struck and dismantled Houthi terrorist infrastructure at the main airport in Sanaa, fully disabling the airport,” the Israeli military said in a statement Tuesday, adding that several major power stations in the Sanaa area were also hit.
    


            The IDF said fighter jets “dismantled” the airport within 15 minutes and struck a concrete plant.
    


            At least one person was killed and three others were injured in the airport attack, according to the Houthi-run Ministry of Health.
    


            Israel's military earlier issued an evacuation warning for Yemen's international airport in Sanaa, marking the first time the IDF has put out such a notification in Yemen, more than 1,000 miles from Israel.
    


            Houthi leader Mohammed al-Bukhaiti vowed retaliation against the Israelis, telling Al Arabiya TV on Tuesday: “We will meet escalation with escalation, and there are still multiple targets within the Zionist entity, sensitive targets, which will cost the Zionist entity large losses.”

            Tuesday's attacks mark a significant escalation between the Iran-backed Houthis and the Israeli military that has spiraled rapidly in recent days.
    


            On Sunday, a Houthi ballistic missile penetrated Israel's air defenses and hit near Ben Gurion international airport after several attempts to intercept the missile failed, the IDF said. The strike appears to be the first time Israel's international airport has been successfully targeted by the group.
    


            The Iran-backed Houthi rebel group claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was in response to Israel's offensive in Gaza, and warned it would “impose a comprehensive air blockade” on Israel by “repeatedly targeting airports,” especially Ben Gurion. It called on international airlines to plan accordingly and cancel all scheduled flights to Israeli airports.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu then vowed retaliation.
    


            “We acted before, we will act in the future too. I can't elaborate all of that. The US, in coordination with us, is also operating against them. It's not ‘one and done' - but there will be hits,” he said in a video address posted on social media Sunday.
    


            In a post to X later, he also promised a response to Iran: “Israel will respond to the Houthi attack against our main airport AND, at a time and place of our choosing, to their Iranian terror masters.”
    


            That retaliation began on Monday when Israeli forces carried out a series of strikes against the port in Hodeidah – Yemen's second largest – and a nearby cement factory, killing at least one person and injuring another 35 people, according to the Ministry of Health.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that 20 of its fighter jets took part in that mission – the first Israeli strikes in Yemen in months – hitting dozens of Houthi targets in Hodeidah and surrounding areas. The Houthi-run TV channel Al-Masirah said the port of Hodeidah was hit at least six times and confirmed the attack on the nearby cement factory.
    


            The IDF claimed the Hodeidah seaport “is used for the transfer of Iranian weapons, equipment for military purposes, and other terror-related need(s).”
    


            Israel struck Sanaa international airport in December, killing at least three people and injuring 30 others, according to the Houthi-run al-Masirah satellite television network.

Same-sex couple says they were appalled after being being confronted and wrongfully accused in women's restroom

A couple visiting Boston says they were left confused and appalled after being forced out of the Liberty Hotel during a Kentucky Derby party on Saturday, following what they describe as being confronted and wrongfully accused in the women's restroom.

Ansley Baker and her girlfriend, Liz Victor, both cisgender women, said a hotel security guard entered the women's bathroom and demanded Baker leave the stall she was using, claiming she didn't belong there.

“All of a sudden there was banging on the door,” Baker recalled to CBS News.

“I pulled my shorts up. I hadn't even tied them. One of the security guards was there telling me to get out of the bathroom, that I was a man in the women's bathroom. I said, ‘I'm a woman.”

Victor, waiting by the sinks, heard the commotion and saw the security guard confronting Baker.

“I looked down and I saw her shoes and that's when I was like, ‘What is going on?” she told the network.

The couple said that once Baker was escorted out, other women in line hurled insults, calling her “a creep” and demanding she be removed. Security staff then allegedly asked both women to show their IDs to confirm their gender. After a heated exchange, they were told to leave the hotel.

In a statement shared with CBS, the Liberty Hotel accuse the two women of sharing one stall: “An incident occurred at the Liberty Hotel on Saturday, May 3 where several women alerted security of two adults sharing a bathroom stall. The bathroom was cleared out as two adults in one stall are not permitted. After leaving the bathroom, a member of the couple from the stall put their hands on our security team and it was then that they were removed from the premises.

“The Liberty Hotel has a zero-tolerance policy for any physical altercations on our property. The safety of our guests and staff is our priority, and this event is under investigation. The Liberty Hotel is and always will be an ally of the LGBTQ+ community and a place where everyone is welcome and celebrated.”

Baker and Victor insist they were never in the same stall and dispute the hotel's account of events.

“Once the stall door opened, and I'm the only one in there, it escalated further,” Baker told Boston News 25. “I don't think that aligns with what they're saying.”

The couple said they have made sure that Boston mayor Michelle Wu's office was aware of their experience in hopes that they can stop a similar situation from happening to anyone else.

They also hope their experience can spark awareness and change.

“We know we're not the only ones that face this kind of thing,” Baker said to CBS. Victor added: “It was a very scary situation, but trans women experience this every single day in the US and across the world.”

The incident comes at a time of heightened tension between the administration and the LGBTQ+ community. Some of Donald Trump's earliest moves in office were to sign executive orders directing the prohibition of gender transitions for people under the age of 19 and banning trans athletes from competing in women's sports.

On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order called “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government”, instructing the federal government to remove “all radical gender ideology guidance, communication, policies, and forms”.

Trump has also limited access and funding for LGBTQ+ arts, with orders that instruct arts organizations not to fund projects that promote “gender ideology” as well as appointing himself chair of the iconic John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.

The incident also echoed an ongoing Republican talking point centered on bathrooms and gender identity. In November 2024, the South Carolina Republican Nancy Mace introduced a bill to ban Representative Sarah McBride from using the bathroom that corresponds with her gender identity. Speaker Mike Johnson has supported and subsequently enforced that ban.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Humanity recorded an unexpected and “unsettling” slowdown in development last year, as the global post-COVID-19 pandemic recovery began losing steam, well before US President Donald Trump dramatically cut US international aid, the UN said yesterday.

The world had rebounded from the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic by 2023, as measured by the UN's Human Development Index (HDI), which charts living standards, health and education. 

However, that rebound appears to be losing momentum, the UN Development Programme's (UNDP) annual report released yesterday said.

If that “unsettling” slowdown becomes the new normal, achieving levels of human development once hoped for by 2030 “could slip by decades — making our world less secure, more divided and more vulnerable to economic and ecological shocks,” UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said. 

Recent drastic cuts to international aid announced by several countries — most notably the US, where Trump has slashed programs and dismantled the US Agency for International Development — would exacerbate the issue, Steiner said in an interview. 

If wealthy countries stop funding development, “this will ultimately impact economies, societies, and yes, I think it will also register maybe a year or two down the line in the Human Development Index, lower life expectancy, declining incomes, more conflicts,” Steiner said.

UNDP experts are not yet certain of the underlying causes of the slowdown observed last year. However, they have identified one of the driving forces as a slackening of progress in life expectancy, perhaps linked to the side-effects of COVID-19, or to the wars that are multiplying around the world.

There is a potential glimmer of hope: Artificial intelligence (AI) could create the conditions for kickstarting development, the UNDP said. 

AI “is perhaps the greatest potential pivot in putting development of individual economies, but also of maybe poor people, wealthy people, on a different trajectory. It will change virtually every aspect of our lives,” Steiner said.

However, it would come down to how people use the technology, the report said. 

There are risks. Access to AI in poorer countries is not the same as in wealthier ones, and cultural biases could influence the way the tools are developed, it said. 

However, “we can design for reducing that risk,” Steiner said, adding that it should not be an impediment to using AI for medical research, for example.

“The future is in our hands,” the report said. “Technology is about people, not just things. Beneath the razzle-dazzle of invention lurk important choices, by the few or the many, whose consequences will reverberate across generations.”

“With the right policies and focus on people, AI can be a crucial bridge to new knowledge, skills, and ideas that can empower everyone from farmers to small business owners,” Pedro Conceicao, who headed the production of the report, said in a statement.

“Nigeria needs someone like Ibrahim Traore of Burkina Faso. He is doing well for his country,” Sanni said.
His admiration is shaped by a steady stream of viral videos, memes and social media posts — many misleading or outright false — portraying Traore as a fearless reformer who defied Western powers and reclaimed his country's dignity.

‘FRAGMENTING':
                                        British politics have for a long time been dominated by the Labor Party and the Tories, but polls suggest that Reform now poses a significant challenge                                        Hard-right upstarts Reform UK snatched a parliamentary seat from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labor Party yesterday in local elections that dealt a blow to the UK's two establishment parties.
Reform, led by anti-immigrant firebrand Nigel Farage, won the by-election in Runcorn and Helsby in northwest England by just six votes, as it picked up gains in other localities, including one mayoralty.
The group's strong showing continues momentum it built up at last year's general election and appears to confirm a trend that the UK is entering an era of multi-party politics.

ENTERTAINMENT: 
                                        Rio officials have a history of organizing massive concerts on Copacabana Beach, with Madonna's show drawing about 1.6 million fans last year                                        Lady Gaga on Saturday night gave a free concert in front of 2 million fans who poured onto Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro for the biggest show of her career. 
“Tonight, we're making history... Thank you for making history with me,” Lady Gaga told a screaming crowd. 
The Mother Monster, as she is known, started the show at about 10:10pm local time with her 2011 song Bloody Mary. Cries of joy rose from the tightly packed fans who sang and danced shoulder-to-shoulder on the vast stretch of sand. 
Concert organizers said 2.1 million people attended the show.

SUPPORT: 
                                        The Australian prime minister promised to back Kyiv against Russia's invasion, saying: ‘That's my government's position. It was yesterday. It still is'                                        Left-leaning Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese yesterday basked in his landslide election win, promising a “disciplined, orderly” government to confront cost-of-living pain and tariff turmoil. 
People clapped as the 62-year-old and his fiancee, Jodie Haydon, who visited his old inner Sydney haunt, Cafe Italia, surrounded by a crowd of jostling photographers and journalists. Albanese's Labor Party is on course to win at least 83 seats in the 150-member parliament, partial results showed. 
Opposition leader Peter Dutton's conservative Liberal-National coalition had just 38 seats, and other parties 12. Another 17 seats were still in doubt.
