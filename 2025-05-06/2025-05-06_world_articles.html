                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaking in real estate terms, a language Mr Trump understands best, Mr Carney said: “Well, if I may, as you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale.” “We're sitting in one right now,” he added, holding his hands up to indicate the Oval Office. After the meeting, Mr Carney said he and Mr Trump had “very constructive” discussions and the US president had “agreed” with him when he said Canada was no for sale. “Some things, as I said in the room, some things are never for sale, and he agreed with that”, he told a press conference. “We're going to have a very, very big announcement to make, like as big as it gets,” he said ahead of departing for the region on Monday. Thank you for following along with our live coverage today. Mark Carney said his meeting with Donald Trump was “very constructive” and he feels “better” about the relationship in several ways. But, Mr Carney added: “look… We have more work to do… I'm not trying to suggest at any respect that we can have one meeting and everything's changed, but now we are engaged, and very fully engaged.” The Canadian Prime Minister said he and Donald Trump are in the middle of “a very complex negotiation about a wide range of issues”. Mr Carney said he did “not expect to have specific progress as things move along, even when you're making progress… that's why it's a global negotiation.” Mark Carney doubled down on his statement in the Oval Office earlier today, saying again: “Canada is not for sale”. He said Donald Trump has “made known his wish” to make Canada America's 51st state “for some time.” “I've been careful always to distinguish between wish and reality”, Mr Carney told the press conference. “I was clear there in the Oval Office, as I've been clear throughout, on behalf of Canadians, saying this is never going to happen, Canada is not for sale, it never will be for sale. Mark Carney has said he and Mr Trump had “very constructive discussions” during their meeting today. “We had what I would describe as wide ranging, and as I said a moment ago, very constructive discussions”, he said during a press conference at the Canadian Embassy. He added: “We agreed to have further conversations in the coming weeks, and we were looking forward to meeting in person at the G7 Summit”. Mark Carney left the White House at 2:12pm, waving to reporters without answering questions. Following lunch, a White House pool reporter asked Melanie Joly, the Canadian Foreign Minister, “How did it go?” She reportedly nodded and smiled. Mr Trump was insisted that his meeting with Mr Carney would remain friendly, following a months-long spat over the US president's treatment of Canada. Mr Carney had previously warned Mr Trump he would not engage with him unless he stopped talking about Canada becoming the 51st state. Ahead of today's Oval Office meeting, Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social America does not need “anything” from Canada, “other than their friendship”. During the face-to-face meeting earlier today, Mr Trump reiterated their friendship. “This is not going to be like -we had another a little blow up with somebody else. This is a very friendly conversation,”  he said, in an apparent reference to his disastrous meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky. Donald Trump said the US doesn't “have to sign deals”, as he grew frustrated with questions over how his tariff negotiations are panning out. We could sign 25 deals right now,” Mr Trump said in his meeting with Mark Carney, addressing progress made so far. “So we can just sit down, and I'll do this at some point over the next two weeks.” Donald Trump earlier told Mark Carney that “it takes two to tango” over his threats for Canada to become the 51st US state. “It takes two to tango, right?,” Mr Trump said during his Oval Office meeting with the Canadian prime minister a short while ago. “I believe it would be a massive tax cut for the Canadian citizens. You get free military, tremendous medical cares, other things. Mr Carney followed up by repeating his insistence that Canada is not for sale. Donald Trump told Mark Carney that Canada will have to take care of itself in its future trading relationship with the US. Speaking in the Oval Office a short while ago, Mr Trump said: “Canada is a place that will have to be able to take care of itself economically.” His comments came after explaining why he intends to pursue tariffs with America's closest trading partner, despite Mr Carney explaining that the two countries' economies and manufacturing bases are deeply enmeshed. Addressing why he does not believe the US should buy cars, steel or aluminium from Canada, Mr Trump said: “We have a tremendous deficit with Canada. Donald Trump and Mark Carney's meeting has come to an end. The two world leaders will now sit down for lunch, accompanied by vice-president JD Vance, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and secretary of state Marco Rubio, as well as an American delegation. Donald Trump announced that the Houthis are ready to lay down their weapons. He later added: “They've said, please don't bomb us any more, and we're not going to attack your ships.” Asked what he was basing the agreement on, Mr Trump said it came from a “very good source”. Mark Carney's left knee was jiggling away as Donald Trump ran through his arguments once again about why Canada should become the 51st state. It was the moment where it could have gone wrong, like when Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky tried to push back on Mr Trump's understanding of Russia and Vladmir Putin. Mr Carney needed to set the American president straight without letting their whole Oval Office meeting spiral out of control. Mr Carney tried and failed to interject a couple of times as Mr Trump extolled the idea of a “wonderful marriage” between the two countries. We're sitting in one right now ...” he said, holding his hands up to indicate the Oval Office. Donald Trump has said there is nothing Canada can do to alleviate US tariffs. Asked if there is any way he would lift tariffs on Canada after today's meeting, Mr Trump said: “No.” Asked why, he said: “That's just the way it is.” Donald Trump has doubled down on his criticism of the US trading relationship with Canada, saying America does not buy “a lot” from Canada. We're at like 4 per cent and usually those things don't last very long. “We have the best a lot of things but Canada, it does a lot more business with us than we do with Canada.” Mark Carney has tried to avoid a diplomatic row in the Oval Office by delicately explaining to Donald Trump Canada was not for sale and would not become the 51st state. Speaking in real estate terms, a language the president understands best, Mr Carney compared Canada to Buckingham Palace and the Oval Office as venues that “are not for sale” . Switching subjects to global tariffs, Mr Trump repeated his message that the US has been “ripped off” by its trading partners for years. The president embarked on a sweeping explanation of why he was imposing tariffs US trading partners - a move that has triggered chaos in the markets. Addressing USMCA - America's trade deal with Canada and Mexico, Mr Trump laid into Mr Carney's predecessor, which fed into his decision to bring the agreement to an end. Mr Carney responded by saying that US tariffs had “taken advantage” of aspects of USMCA, which he said they would “have to change”. Mark Carney has said that Canada will “never” be for sale. We're sitting in one right now, Buckingham Palace, you visited as well,” Mr Carney said. “It's not for sale, won't be for sale ever, but the opportunity is in the partnership and what we can build together.” Donald Trump has said that “friendship” is the one concession he would like from Canada. Regardless of anything, we're going to be friends with Canada. I know so many people that live in Canada. The president went on to praise the hockey skills of Wayne Gretzky and Mark Carney himself, calling his counterpart a “very good hockey player”. It comes after Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened to turn Canada into the US 51st state. Mark Carney has praised Donald Trump as a “transformational president”. Donald Trump has said he and Mark Carney intend to discuss the Ukraine war in their meeting today. “I think we have a lot of things in common. Donald Trump has praised Mark Carney for winning the Canadian election. Mr Carney came from well behind in the polls to win last month's Canadian election on a ticket to counter Mr Trump's threats. Donald Trump has greeted Mark Carney outside the White House. Mark Carney was due to arrive at the White House at 4.30pm (11.30am local time) but the meeting appears to have been delayed. “Our old relationship based on steadily increasing integration is over. The questions now are how our nations will cooperate in the future,” Mr Carney said in his first post-election press conference on Friday. As well as raising defence spending, Mr Carney has said he would “fight to get the best deal” on tariffs with the US. However, Howard Lutnick, Mr Trump's ultra-loyal commerce secretary, said it would be “really complex” to reach a deal. “They have their socialist regime and it's basically feeding off of America,” he told Fox Business on Monday. “I just don't see how it works out perfectly.” From December, Mr Trump began posting messages on social media about Canada becoming America's “51st state”. On Feb 1, Mr Trump signed an executive order imposing 25 per cent tariffs on nearly all goods from Canada and Mexico before agreeing to a 30-day pause two days later. On March 10, Ontario, Canada's most populous province, announced its own tariffs, including a 25 percent surcharge on the electricity, sparking fury from Mr Trump. On March 26, Mr Trump announced a further 25 per cent tariff on imported cars and car parts shipped into the US, including from Canada. Mr Trump has called Mr Carney a “very nice gentleman” but made it clear he believed the Canadian was coming seeking a trade deal. Donald Trump is set to welcome Mark Carney at 4.30pm UK (11.30am local). This will be followed by an Oval Office meeting and then lunch. Mr Carney is due to hold a press conference at 8pm UK (3pm local). Mr Carney be seeking to cool the temperature and move towards a trade deal as he meets Mr Trump in the Oval Office today. “Canada and the United States are strongest when we work together - and that work starts now,” Mr Carney said on X as he arrived in Washington on Monday. I've arrived in Washington, D.C. ahead of meetings with President Trump tomorrow.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian drones attacked Moscow for the second consecutive night, temporarily halting flights at four airports in the Russian capital and nine further afield – as it prepares to host a major military parade expected to be attended by world leaders including China's Xi Jinping. Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said in a Telegram post Tuesday that at least 19 Ukrainian drones were destroyed on their approach to the capital overnight, one night after Russian air defenses shot down four drones near the city. There were no immediate reports of serious damage or casualties, but debris from downed drones fell on a major highway, Sobyanin said. Flights were temporarily suspended as a safety precaution at four of the capital's airports, according to Russian aviation authorities. Related article Russia's Putin says he hopes there will be no need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine The latest Ukrainian attack on the Russian capital comes ahead of Xi's expected arrival in Moscow on Wednesday for a three-day state visit, in which the Chinese leader will take part in Friday's May 9 Victory Day celebrations, according to a Kremlin statement Sunday. North Korea will send an ambassador to Moscow – and India, Nicaragua and South Africa will be represented by high-level delegations, he said. Victory Day is the most significant day in Russian President Vladimir Putin's calendar, as he has long used it to rally public support and demonstrate the country's military prowess. Thousands of people are expected to line the streets of Moscow's Red Square on Friday in an exhibition of patriotism marking the Soviet Union's role in defeating Nazi Germany and commemorating the more than 25 million Soviet soldiers and civilians who died during World War II. Kyiv called on international allies not to send troops to Russia's Victory Day celebrations in Moscow, warning that participation would amount to “sharing responsibility for the blood of Ukrainian children, civilians, and military personnel.” Troops from 13 countries are set to take part in the parade, Russia's presidential aid said. The parade will involve marching units from Azerbaijan, Vietnam, China, and Egypt among others, Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Mikhail Razvozhaev, the Russian-backed head of Sevastopol, announced commemorations were canceled “for security reasons,” in a decision mandated by Russia's defense ministry. Similarly, Kuban Veniamin Kondratyev, the head of Krasnador, warned such celebrations posed “a big risk.” Putin last month declared a unilateral three-day ceasefire in Ukraine to coincide with the May 9 celebrations based on what he called “humanitarian considerations,” prompting skepticism in Kyiv. Following the attacks on Tuesday, Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, accused Kyiv of “continuing the war,” insisting that the Easter truce “is still relevant.” But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly criticized the three-day ceasefire, saying he was only ready to sign up for a longer truce of at least 30 days. In that time, Russian attacks have killed at least 46 civilians and injured another 337 in Ukraine, according to a CNN tally of figures from local authorities and emergency services. A Russian missile strike on the outskirts of Sumy in central Ukraine on Tuesday killed three people, including a six-year-old boy, Sumy's regional military administration said. Kyiv won't be “playing games to create a pleasant atmosphere to allow for Putin's exit from isolation on 9 May,” Zelensky said in his nightly address on Saturday. In response, Russia's foreign ministry said his comments amounted to a threat. Zelensky has demanded answers from China in recent weeks, after he revealed that two Chinese fighters had been captured by Ukraine in early April and claimed there were “many more” in Russia's ranks. Beijing denied any involvement and repeated previous calls for Chinese citizens to “refrain from participating in military actions of any party.” On Saturday, Ukraine claimed it shot down a Russian Su-30 fighter jet in the Black Sea using a seaborne drone for the first time. Meanwhile, a Ukrainian official told CNN the country's military retains a presence inside Russia's Kursk, days after Moscow said it had completely recaptured the western region following a months-long incursion by Kyiv's forces. CNN's Anna Chernova, Victoria Butenko, Kosta Gak, Sophie Tanno, Darya Tarasova, Daria Tarasova-Markina, Edward Upright, Sana Noor Haq and Eve Brennan contributed reporting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A couple visiting Boston says they were left confused and appalled after being forced out of the Liberty Hotel during a Kentucky Derby party on Saturday, following what they describe as being confronted and wrongfully accused in the women's restroom. Ansley Baker and her girlfriend, Liz Victor, both cisgender women, said a hotel security guard entered the women's bathroom and demanded Baker leave the stall she was using, claiming she didn't belong there. “All of a sudden there was banging on the door,” Baker recalled to CBS News. The couple said that once Baker was escorted out, other women in line hurled insults, calling her “a creep” and demanding she be removed. After a heated exchange, they were told to leave the hotel. In a statement shared with CBS, the Liberty Hotel accuse the two women of sharing one stall: “An incident occurred at the Liberty Hotel on Saturday, May 3 where several women alerted security of two adults sharing a bathroom stall. The bathroom was cleared out as two adults in one stall are not permitted. “The Liberty Hotel has a zero-tolerance policy for any physical altercations on our property. “I don't think that aligns with what they're saying.” The couple said they have made sure that Boston mayor Michelle Wu's office was aware of their experience in hopes that they can stop a similar situation from happening to anyone else. They also hope their experience can spark awareness and change. Victor added: “It was a very scary situation, but trans women experience this every single day in the US and across the world.” On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order called “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government”, instructing the federal government to remove “all radical gender ideology guidance, communication, policies, and forms”. Trump has also limited access and funding for LGBTQ+ arts, with orders that instruct arts organizations not to fund projects that promote “gender ideology” as well as appointing himself chair of the iconic John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The incident also echoed an ongoing Republican talking point centered on bathrooms and gender identity. In November 2024, the South Carolina Republican Nancy Mace introduced a bill to ban Representative Sarah McBride from using the bathroom that corresponds with her gender identity. Speaker Mike Johnson has supported and subsequently enforced that ban.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liberal candidate Allison Riggs won the race by 734 votes over her conservative opponent, Jefferson Griffin. A federal judge has ordered an end to efforts by a conservative candidate for the North Carolina State Supreme Court to invalidate thousands of voters' ballots in last year's election, saying that his liberal opponent must be certified the winner of their race. Conservative Judge Jefferson Griffin lost to incumbent Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs in the statewide contest by just 734 votes. Griffin sought to invalidate the election outcome through various methods, including arguing that military and overseas absentee ballots, which do not require photo identification to cast, were illegal and thus should be discounted. Griffin himself utilized military absentee ballots in both the 2019 and 2020 election cycles. You don't change them after the game is done,” Myers wrote in his opinion. Myers noted that the case is about two issues: whether “the federal Constitution permits a state to alter the rules of an election after the fact and apply those changes retroactively to only a select group of voters,” and whether states may redefine classes of eligible voters “but offer no process to those who may have been misclassified as ineligible.” “To this court, the answer to each of those questions is ‘no,'” Myers ruled, stating that previous orders by state courts allowing Griffin's complaints to move forward “violate the equal protection and substantive due process rights of overseas military and civilian voters.” Myers allowed Griffin's legal team seven days to appeal his decision before it can be enforced. It's not clear as of Tuesday morning whether Griffin will pursue the matter further. “It is pretty fair to say that the idea of disenfranchising voters after they have voted — for administrative errors where the voters were clearly legal voters — is an affront to basic principles of democracy and sets a dangerous precedent,” said Steven Greene, a political science professor at N.C. State University. An analysis from Rick Hasen, a University of California, Los Angeles, law professor and frequent contributor to Election Law Blog, noted that an appeal from Griffin would prolong the case but wouldn't have a strong likelihood of succeeding.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel struck multiple sites in Yemen's capital Sanaa Tuesday, including the main airport, which the Israeli military said has now been “fully” disabled. “A short while ago, IDF (Israel Defense Forces) fighter jets struck and dismantled Houthi terrorist infrastructure at the main airport in Sanaa, fully disabling the airport,” the Israeli military said in a statement Tuesday, adding that several major power stations in the Sanaa area were also hit. At least one person was killed and three others were injured in the airport attack, according to the Houthi-run Ministry of Health. Israel's military earlier issued an evacuation warning for Yemen's international airport in Sanaa, marking the first time the IDF has put out such a notification in Yemen, more than 1,000 miles from Israel. Houthi leader Mohammed al-Bukhaiti vowed retaliation against the Israelis, telling Al Arabiya TV on Tuesday: “We will meet escalation with escalation, and there are still multiple targets within the Zionist entity, sensitive targets, which will cost the Zionist entity large losses.” Related article Israel strikes targets in Yemen for the first time in months, a day after Houthis attack Tel Aviv airport Tuesday's attacks mark a significant escalation between the Iran-backed Houthis and the Israeli military that has spiraled rapidly in recent days. On Sunday, a Houthi ballistic missile penetrated Israel's air defenses and hit near Ben Gurion international airport after several attempts to intercept the missile failed, the IDF said. The Iran-backed Houthi rebel group claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was in response to Israel's offensive in Gaza, and warned it would “impose a comprehensive air blockade” on Israel by “repeatedly targeting airports,” especially Ben Gurion. It called on international airlines to plan accordingly and cancel all scheduled flights to Israeli airports. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu then vowed retaliation. I can't elaborate all of that. It's not ‘one and done' - but there will be hits,” he said in a video address posted on social media Sunday. In a post to X later, he also promised a response to Iran: “Israel will respond to the Houthi attack against our main airport AND, at a time and place of our choosing, to their Iranian terror masters.” That retaliation began on Monday when Israeli forces carried out a series of strikes against the port in Hodeidah – Yemen's second largest – and a nearby cement factory, killing at least one person and injuring another 35 people, according to the Ministry of Health. Israel struck Sanaa international airport in December, killing at least three people and injuring 30 others, according to the Houthi-run al-Masirah satellite television network.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York City event organizers have cancelled a Pride month concert by R&B artist Kehlani after pressure from Mayor Eric Adams's office against the outspoken pro-Palestine artist. The concert, billed as “Pride with Kehlani,” was slated to take place on June 26 in Central Park. It was organized by nonprofit SummerStage, which puts on free concerts across New York. The group cited supposed “safety” concerns, which they said were brought to them by the mayor's office, as well as “controversy surrounding Cornell University's” recent cancellation of a performance by the singer over their pro-Palestine views. Late last month, Cornell cancelled a performance by Kehlani, citing their “anti-Israel sentiments” and claiming, without evidence, that they have espoused antisemitic sentiments. The Grammy-nominated singer has spoken up numerous times against Israel's genocide in Gaza. The artist, for instnace, incorporated pro-Palestinian imagery in a 2024 music video for their song, “Next 2 U.” In the video, the singer and background dancers wore outfits made with keffiyeh material, while they performed in front of a Palestinian flag. In response to Cornell's cancellation, Kehlani said in a video posted online, “I'm being asked and called to clarify and make a statement yet again for the millionth time that I am not antisemitic nor anti-Jew.” The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) New York had previously condemned Cornell's cancellation as suppression of free speech. “The decision to cancel Kehlani's performance comes after Cornell University has repeatedly suppressed student protests for Palestine and against genocide,” said CAIR-NY Executive Director Afaf Nasher. “We strongly condemn Cornell not just for cancelling Kehlani's performance due to her pro-Palestinian stance, but for clearly demonstrating its lack of commitment to free speech and diverse opinion by policing the speech and opinion only of political beliefs in support of Palestine,” Nasher went on. Recently, Irish band Kneecap faced a deluge of negative press and threats of legal retaliation from U.K. authorities after speaking out for Palestinian rights during a performance at Coachella, in California.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US officials are aware of Russia's views on Ukraine and understand how they could bring about lasting peace if put into practice, Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov said. "Our American colleagues are well aware of our position and have an idea how, if we follow through with implementing our position, we can come to a durable peace settlement," he told reporters when asked about discussing with the US the conditions for a Ukraine settlement that Russian President Vladimir Putin put forward in June 2024. "The Americans certainly are aware of what we have proposed and that we have declared a three-day ceasefire in connection with Victory Day celebrations. And probably many people took note that yesterday President Trump praised this step by the Russian leadership," the aide said. Territorial issues have also been actively discussed during the talks, he went on to say. Russian President Vladimir Putin in June 2024 named the conditions for talks with Ukraine, which included withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from Donbass and Novorossiya, an end to Kiev's aspirations to join NATO, lifting all Western sanctions against Moscow, and Ukraine's commitment to uphold a non-aligned and nuclear-free status and fully respect the rights, freedoms and interests of its Russian-speaking citizens. The ceasefire that President Vladimir Putin announced for Victory in Europe Day will last from midnight on May 8 to midnight on May 11. According to the Kremlin, all hostilities will be halted for the period. Vladimir Zelensky rejected the proposal, demanding a longer pause and setting his own terms. He also threatened the celebrations in Moscow.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Palestinians struggle to get donated food at a community kitchen in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, on May 5.Abdel Kareem Hana/The Canadian Press Palestinians are exhausted and hopeless, pummelled by 19 months of heavy bombing. Families of Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza are terrified that the possibility of a ceasefire is slipping further away. “What's left for you to bomb?” asked Moaz Kahlout, a displaced man from Gaza City who said many resort to GPS to locate the rubble of homes wiped out in the war. Israeli officials said Monday that Cabinet ministers approved the plan to seize Gaza and remain in the Palestinian territory for an unspecified amount of time – news that came hours after the military chief said the army was calling up tens of thousands of reserve soldiers. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Israel says 59 captives remain in Gaza, about 35 of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's ensuing offensive has killed more than 52,000 people in Gaza, many of them women and children, according to Palestinian health officials, who don't distinguish between combatants and civilians in their count. We do not want to remain homeless, hungry, and thirsty.” Families of hostages held in Gaza are afraid of what an expanded military operation or seizure could mean for their relatives. It feels like déjà vu from the year ago,” said Adi Alexander, father of Israeli-American Edan Alexander, a soldier captured in the Oct. 7 attack. Israeli leaders have said they don't plan to expand the operation in Gaza until after Trump's visit, leaving the door open for a possible deal. Trump isn't expected to visit Israel, but he and other American officials have frequently spoken about Edan Alexander, the last American-Israeli held in Gaza who is still believed to be alive. “We hope it's merely a signal to Hamas that Israel is serious in its goal to dismantle its governmental and military capabilities as a leverage for negotiations, but it's unclear whether this is an end or a means,” he said. Meanwhile, every day, dozens of Palestinians gather outside a charity kitchen that distributes hot meals to displaced families in southern Gaza. “What should we do?” asked Sara Younis, a woman from the southernmost city of Rafah, as she waited for a hot meal for her children. Israel cut off Gaza from all imports in early March, leading to dire shortages of food, medicine and other supplies. Aid organizations have warned that malnutrition and hunger are becoming increasingly prevalent in Gaza. Like most aid groups in Gaza, Tikeya has run out of most food and has cooked almost exclusively pasta for the past two weeks. Nidal Abu Helal, a displaced man from Rafah who works at the charity, said that the group is increasingly concerned that people, especially children, will die of starvation. “We're not afraid of dying from missiles,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Queer Australians are axing travel plans to Washington DC's World Pride festival, as Donald Trump's executive orders targeting LGBTQ+ rights leads to fears of discrimination at the US border and potential attacks. Washington DC will host the 2025 edition of World Pride from 23 May to 8 June, with tens of thousands of domestic and international tourists originally expected to travel to the capital for events including a parade, concerts, street festivals, lectures and a human rights conference. The Guardian was contacted by LGBTQ+ Australians, including trans and same-sex couples, who had scheduled trips to the US to incorporate World Pride but in recent weeks ditched their plans. The University of Canberra student, who is examining LGBTIQ+ discrimination in healthcare for their PhD, was offered a scholarship that covered travel expenses to attend World Pride's human rights conference. I hadn't really read many reports of people being detained or denied entry at the time.” However, after an Equality Australia travel warning and recent reports of discrimination in the US, they decided to withdraw their acceptance of the funded trip. “Given my appearance as identifiably queer, my academic profile being centred on LGBTIQ+ discrimination, and my online presence where I am openly queer, I was not confident that I would be able to get into the US without being detained,” they said. I realised there was a very real possibility of being detained. Beyond the risk of discrimination from customs and border officials, Bartels said their partner had raised safety concerns about World Pride itself. “Even though Washington DC is quite progressive, you can be worried about gun violence at any queer event in the US.” Missing out on the conference and World Pride was a “double whammy”, Bartels said. “The irony of not being able to attend a human rights conference due to a possible lack of human rights is not lost on me.” World Pride organisers announced this week they were relocating events set to be hosted at the Kennedy Center – which Donald Trump took over this year – to an alternative venue because of “inhospitable” conditions, including the banning of drag performances. “Even though the specific locations we were planning to visit are known for being progressive, the risks that I face as a trans woman in being arbitrarily turned back or detained at the border are too high,” she said. “Considering the hostile actions the Trump administration is taking against queer and gender-diverse Americans, unfortunately we don't envisage being able to visit any time soon.” Other Australian families have cancelled holidays to the US because of fears of how border officials would process their gay or trans children, they told Guardian Australia in response to a reader callout in April. Separately, an Australian man with a working visa who was detained and deported on returning to the US, alleged border officials called him “retarded” and boasted “Trump is back in town”. Australian academics are refusing to attend US conferences for fear of being detained. “While Washington DC is generally more progressive, travellers to World Pride should be mindful that visiting other states comes with risks like being arrested or fined for using the ‘wrong' bathroom,” Corkhill said “Even in the capitol and its office buildings, trans people are unable to use single sex bathrooms and changing rooms that align with who they are.” The president and CEO of Washington DC's official tourism arm Destination DC, Elliott Ferguson, said millions of people were expected to attend World Pride 2025. “We have not heard of any widespread cancellations and remain optimistic that turnout will be strong,” Ferguson said, speaking on behalf of World Pride 2025. Washington DC is a place to advocate and make your voice heard.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth looks on as President Donald Trump delivers remarks in the Oval Office at the White House, in Washington, on March 21.Carlos Barria/Reuters Roughly a week after Donald Trump started his second term as president, the U.S. military issued an order to three freight airlines operating out of Dover Air Force Base in Delaware and a U.S. base in Qatar: Stop 11 flights loaded with artillery shells and other weaponry and bound for Ukraine. Was it a permanent pause on all aid? Within one week, flights were back in the air. The cancellations came after Trump wrapped up a January 30 Oval Office meeting about Ukraine that included Hegseth and other top national security officials, according to three sources familiar with the situation. Asked to comment on this report, the White House told Reuters that Hegseth had followed a directive from Trump to pause aid to Ukraine, which it said was the administration's position at the time. It did not explain why, according to those who spoke to Reuters, top national security officials in the normal decision making process didn't know about the order or why it was so swiftly reversed. “Negotiating an end to the Russia-Ukraine War has been a complex and fluid situation. We are not going to detail every conversation among top administration officials throughout the process,” said Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokeswoman. “The bottom line is the war is much closer to an end today than it was when President Trump took office.” In response to a request for comment, TRANSCOM said that the total cost was $1.6 million – 11 flights were cancelled but one incurred no charge. An order halting military aid authorized under the Biden administration went into effect officially a month later, on March 4, with a White House announcement. The story of how flights were cancelled, detailed by Reuters for the first time, points to an at-times haphazard policy-making process within the Trump administration and a command structure that is unclear even to its own ranking members. At the Pentagon, the disarray is an open secret, with many current and former officials saying the department is plagued by internal disagreements on foreign policy, deep-seated grudges, and inexperienced staff. Reuters couldn't establish exactly when Hegseth's office ordered the freight flights cancelled. Two sources said Ukrainian and European officials began asking about the pause on February 2. “This is consistent with the administration's policy to move fast, break things and sort it out later. That is their managing philosophy,” said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine officer and defence expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. But when you're talking about institutions that have been around for hundreds of years, you are going to run into problems.” Ukrainian officials did not respond to requests for comment. The majority of US military assistance goes through a logistics hub in Poland before being picked up by Ukrainian representatives and transported into the country. That hub can hold shipments for extended periods of time. It's not clear if the 11 cancelled flights were the only ones scheduled that week in February, how much aid was already stockpiled in Poland and if it continued to flow into Ukraine despite the U.S. military's orders. The secretary continues to face scrutiny, including from Congress, about his own communications. Previously he's attributed allegations of upheaval to disgruntled employees. The cancelled flights contained weapons that had long been approved by the Biden administration, authorized by lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Reuters couldn't determine if Hegseth or his team knew how the order to TRANSCOM would play out or that the order would be a substantial change in U.S. policy on Ukraine. Three sources familiar with the situation said Hegseth misinterpreted discussions with the president about Ukraine policy and aid shipments without elaborating further. Four other people briefed on the situation said a small cadre of staffers inside the Pentagon, many of whom have never held a government job and who have for years spoken out against U.S. aid to Ukraine, advised Hegseth to consider pausing aid to the country. Two people familiar with the matter denied there was a true cutoff in aid. One of them described it as a logistical pause. “(They) just wanted to get a handle on what was going on and people, as a result, misinterpreted that as: ‘You need to stop everything,'” said one. According to two sources with knowledge of the meeting, Hegseth arrived at the January 30 Oval Office meeting with Trump with a memo drafted by some of his top policy advisers, advocating that their boss push the White House to consider pausing weapons deliveries to Ukraine to gain leverage in peace negotiations with Russia. But a few shipments remained in the pipeline, scheduled into this summer. An order effectively freezing any military support for an ally would normally be discussed intensively among top national security officials and approved by the president. None of that discussion or co-ordination happened when Hegseth's office cancelled the scheduled flights carrying American artillery shells and ammunition to Poland from Al Udeid military base in the United Arab Emirates and the Dover U.S. military base in Delaware, three of the sources said. The pause came as Ukraine's military was struggling to fend off Russian forces in eastern Ukraine and in the consequential battle for the Kursk region of Russia, where Ukrainian forces were losing ground and have since all but been expelled. Some media outlets, including Reuters, wrote about the pause but Hegseth's role was previously unknown. It's unclear if Trump subsequently questioned or reprimanded Hegseth. Two of his most prominent envoys, Kellogg, a supporter of Kyiv who worked with Trump in his first administration, and Steve Witkoff, a real-estate magnate and close friend of the president, set out to negotiate with both parties. Separately, at the Pentagon, some of Hegseth's policy advisers privately started drafting proposals to pull back American support for Ukraine, according to two sources briefed on the matter. That group of staffers align themselves closely with the anti-interventionist philosophy. Some have previously advised Republican lawmakers advocating for an America-first approach to foreign policy and have called publicly, in writings and talks, for the U.S. to pull back from military commitments in the Mideast and Europe – a view similarly held by Vice President JD Vance. Several have advocated that the U.S. instead focus on China. At a time when Kellogg and Witkoff are trying to broker a peace deal with Russia and Ukraine, the staffers have advocated behind the scenes for the U.S. to draw back its support for Kyiv – a policy that has angered Ukrainian officials and pressured European allies to fill the gap, five people with knowledge of the situation said. Washington has signed a deal with Kyiv for rights to its rare earth minerals – an agreement U.S. officials say is an attempt to recoup money America has spent to prop up Ukraine's war effort. At least one of the staffers who had previously pushed for the administration to pull back its support for Kyiv, Dan Caldwell, was escorted out of the Pentagon for a leak he claims never happened. Caldwell, a veteran, served as one of Hegseth's chief advisers, including on Ukraine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections on May 5 to certify the results of the state's 2024 Supreme Court election and confirm the victory of Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs after the results were challenged by a Republican judge. Myers wrote that Griffin cannot “change the rules of the game after it had been played.” “The court cannot countenance that strategy ... which implicates the very integrity of the election and offends 'the law's basic interest in finality,'” the judge wrote. “Permitting parties to ‘upend the set rules' of an election after the election has taken place can only produce 'confusion and turmoil [which] threatens to undermine public confidence in the federal courts, state agencies, and the elections themselves. Myers's ruling comes after Griffin sought to have more than 60,000 ballots that had been counted in the final tally on Nov. 5 thrown out, with the Republican arguing that voters did not provide their state driver's license numbers or Social Security numbers, as is required when registering under a 2004 state law. Still, the state's highest court determined that thousands of overseas and military ballots that lacked photo identification as required by state law needed to verify their eligibility within a 30-day period known as a “cure period” or risk having their votes tossed out. “This case is also about whether a state may redefine its class of eligible voters but offer no process to those who may have been misclassified as ineligible,” he wrote. The judge concluded that the retroactive invalidation of absentee ballots cast by overseas military and civilian voters violates voters' equal protection and due process rights under the Constitution. Myers stayed his decision for seven days to allow Griffin time to appeal with the Fourth U.S. The Epoch Times contacted Griffin's office for further comment but did not receive a response by publication time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Santa Ana community angry after pets found dead and suspect Alejandro Acosta Oliveros released on bail The residents of the California town, rocked by allegations of a serial cat killer in their midst, feel they have been provoked into taking matters into their own hands. Alejandro Acosta Oliveros, whom locals suspect is behind the spate of disappearances, was arrested on April 23. Police said he was detained after being “positively identified by witnesses”. Mr Oliveros was charged with animal cruelty offences, carrying a potential three-year jail term. In southern California the main threat to wandering cats is traffic and predatory beasts such as coyotes. But in the town of Santa Ana, around 30 miles south of Los Angeles, as many as 30 beloved pets are missing, feared dead. They are terrified that number will rise after the man they claim is behind the killings was released on bail, she said. Surrounding a house, protesters carried signs accusing the suspect of having blood on his hands. One sign read: “Hoy gatos, manana humanos (today cats, tomorrow humans).” Dramatic footage captured by a local news channel shows one man clad in black hurling a rock at the home, meanwhile someone with a megaphone shouts: “Your community is watching your every move”, as blue police lights illuminate the scene. Other neighbours can be seen appearing to try to pull down a fence, while a separate clip, posted online, shows a woman wearing white cat ears wailing in the street over the loss of her beloved pet. People are out for blood and I could not agree more,” a witness posted on Nextdoor after the night of violence. “I don't think it needs to be like this. The incident prompted local police to issue a stark warning. “While we support the community's right to peacefully assemble, the Santa Ana Police Department will not tolerate acts of violence, vandalism, or any threats to public safety,” a spokesman said in a statement. According to Ms Gold, the cat killer lured some of his victims with catnip-laced food. Local news reported one cat was allegedly found hanging from a tree. There are unconfirmed rumours that some of the cats were skinned. Some locals believe cats were killed with a stamp to the head, others say they were injected with an unknown substance, according to KTLA Five. There are claims people saw cats snatched from their neighbour's driveways, meanwhile grainy CCTV footage, obtained by NBC News, appears to show a man reaching down to coax a creature from beneath a car into his arms. “I saw this same man grab [my] neighbour's cat, inject it with a needle and some sort of substance. I saw him and yelled, hey...to get his attention,” one person wrote on the platform Nextdoor. “We followed him at a distance and called the police. The police just told us to stay where we were until they arrived and not to follow him because we did not know how dangerous this person could be,” she said. Jennifer Corrales added: “I've had [my cat] since he was a baby. I bottle-fed him...He's been with me since a few weeks old. I don't know what he might have done to my cat.” Anger has been directed at Todd Spitzer, the Republican District Attorney, following Mr Acosta Oliveros's release. “That he was released so quickly is a travesty,” said Meredith Kirby, an organiser with OC Community Cats, a local animal welfare group. “This man has a terrifying history of harming and even killing innocent cats, posing a very personal and real threat to my own feline friends,” Vanessa Rodriguez wrote online. “Our quiet community has been shattered by the horrifying actions of Mr Oliveros… shocking as it may be, he's out on the streets while our pets live in fear,” she added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence has spoken out against the White House's stance on the war in Ukraine, saying its actions have "only emboldened Russia" despite efforts to bring about a ceasefire. "If the last three years teaches us anything, it's that (Russian President) Vladimir Putin doesn't want peace; he wants Ukraine," Pence said in an interview with CNN published on May 5. "And the fact that we are now nearly two months following a ceasefire agreement that Ukraine has agreed to and Russia continues to delay and give excuses confirms that point," he added. Ukraine has already agreed to a U.S.-proposed full 30-day ceasefire, saying on March 11 that Kyiv is ready if Russia also agrees to the terms. Trump has reportedly grown frustrated with the slow progression of peace negotiations, claiming on April 26 that Putin may be "tapping me along," and that he may not be interested in ending the war. Criticizing the approach, Pence said Putin "only understands power." Instead of agreeing to the U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire in March, the Kremlin has instead unilaterally declared its own partial truces. Putin on April 28 announced a so-called "humanitarian truce" from May 7-9, during Moscow's Victory Day celebrations. Despite being from what the White House had originally called for, Trump on May 5 hailed it as a significant step towards a peace settlement. "As you know, President Putin just announced a three-day ceasefire, which doesn't sound like much, but it's a lot, if you know where we started from," Trump told reporters in an Oval Office briefing. In his interview with CNN, Pence also warned of the long-term consequences of not achieving a just peace in Ukraine. "This is not just about Ukraine for me. I really do believe that if Vladimir Putin overruns Ukraine, it's just a matter of time before he crosses a border where our men and women in uniform are going to have to go fight him," he said.</p>

The Jalisco New Generation Cartel, a violent drug trafficking group, has been accused by Mexican authorities of operating the Rancho Izaguirre in Jalisco state to train newly recruited gunmen.

He also said that the state Human Rights Commission had formally informed local authorities of the ranch in 2021, but no action was taken.

Following public pressure, the Jalisco state prosecutor's office agreed to publish online photos of the shoes and other clothing items found at the ranch so that families searching for relatives can see them. Manero said that the pieces of evidence will also be made available to relatives.

However, members of the Jalisco Search Warriors have expressed disappointment at Manero's public statements and response, saying they had sufficient evidence that bodies were burned at the site.

A group member, Raúl Servín, also said late April that a compatriot in the group, María del Carmen Morales, had been killed following their discovery in March.

Policy analysts in the United States have said that the cartels operate as a shadow government within Mexico, making them difficult to dismantle.</p>

Salam resigned in January to become prime minister of Lebanon. The court also issued three provisional measures regarding Israel's military activities in the Gaza Strip last year, including an order for an immediate halt to attacks on the southern city of Rafah. The ICJ has no means of enforcing its judgments or orders, and neither Russia nor Israel has complied with them. However, Iwasawa stressed that the ICJ's judgments are binding. “Legally, countries have to abide by them,” he said. According to Iwasawa, there have been times when only a single lawsuit would be filed with the ICJ every few years, but at present 25 cases are being contested at the court. They no longer are limited to traditional disputes over national borders and maritime boundaries. Questions of human rights and environmental issues have become more common,” Iwasawa said during the interview on April 7. As an expert on international law, Iwasawa has served as a professor at the University of Tokyo Graduate Schools for Law and Politics and as the chairperson of the U.N. Human Rights Committee, which deals with human rights issues in countries around the globe. Commenting on the fact that the two international courts both have Japanese people in roles of major responsibility, Iwasawa pointed out, “We carry out our duties as individuals and are not representing Japan.” Noting people's growing awareness of international justice, however, he expressed his hope that more Japanese will play active roles internationally, and not just in the field of justice. I would like them to be strongly motivated and sharpen their English language skills, no matter what field they want to be in.” Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. In June 2024, at a national science and technology conference, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that the high-tech sector had become “the frontline and main battlefield of international competition, profoundly reshaping the global order and the pattern of development.” He is, of course, absolutely right. China is an increasingly formidable rival on this front. Now, China is giving the United States a run for its money. In addition to being bigger than Tesla, BYD is arguably more inventive, with vehicles that can slide sideways into parking spots and float during emergencies, and chargers that can replenish up to 250 miles of range in a mere five minutes—several times faster than Tesla superchargers. The state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China also intends to rival U.S. leaders in the aerospace manufacturing field; this March, the company released plans for a long-range supersonic jet that produces supersonic booms no louder than a hairdryer. Chinese biotech companies are competing with their U.S. counterparts in creating new drugs. Much of the U.S. government response to this increasing competition in recent years has been protectionist, including tariffs on electric vehicles, curbs on Chinese investments in strategic sectors, and export controls on the GPU chips and chipmaking equipment used for advanced artificial intelligence. But the success of the Chinese AI company DeepSeek, spun out of a Chinese hedge fund, has made clear that this approach is ultimately futile. In January, DeepSeek launched a high-quality AI tool that it developed without access to the enormous number of high-end GPUs thought to be required for such a model. Sooner or later, China is going to invent its way around whatever roadblocks Washington imposes. When the government in Beijing decides that China must lead in a certain technology, resources are not an issue, and neither is short-term profitability. Washington, on the other hand, traditionally respects market forces and opposes government-led industrial policy. On the battlefield of technology, Americans must both continue to do what they do best and find new ways to improve competitiveness. Since World War II, the United States has regularly created and commercialized groundbreaking technologies. But that success should not be taken for granted. Through its recent initiatives to cut federal funds for university research, the Trump administration risks draining a crucial source of new ideas for industry and the military, even as the geopolitical threats it faces continue to grow. To avert scientific and technological stagnation, the United States must significantly increase public investments in university-based research, ensure that it capitalizes on discoveries that emerge from academia, and devise sensible immigration policies that allow the world's best students to study and then work in the United States. Right now, however, the administration seems hell-bent on damaging, rather than fostering, this crucial source of American strength. The wellspring of that innovation is very often U.S. research universities. Many of the most significant technologies of our day—including the Internet, the artificial neural networks that enable generative AI, quantum computing, nucleic acid sequencing, DNA amplification, CRISPR genome editing, mRNA vaccines and therapeutics, 3D printing, and checkpoint inhibitors for cancer treatment—arose from pioneering explorations in U.S. university laboratories. As of 2021, the United States still invested far more than any other nation in the conduct of basic scientific research. A May 2023 analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas found that U.S. government support for nondefense research and development has accounted for at least one-fifth of total factor productivity growth in the U.S. business sector since World War II—a far greater return than federal investments in infrastructure have yielded or than private R & D has produced. (Most industry research is inevitably more focused on narrower questions with nearer-term commercial benefits.) universities have increased the share of their own funds spent on research, including endowment income, from 21 percent in 2012 to 25 percent in 2021. But income from even the largest endowment cannot replace the loss of federal funds to academic R & D, which amounted to nearly $60 billion in fiscal year 2023. In 2021, the United States ranked 23rd among 32 nations reporting to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in terms of academic spending on R & D as a percentage of GDP. China, in contrast, announced earlier this year a ten percent increase to its central government science and technology spending and an increased focus on basic research. Many of Beijing's political leaders earned degrees from Tsinghua University, often referred to as “China's MIT.” These officials understand science and technology and its impact on all else. As a result, Chinese leaders view universities as key to the country's “national rejuvenation” and technological self-reliance, and they have tripled the country's number of higher education institutions since 1998. China is not merely increasing the scale of its inputs to innovation but also their quality. In the 2016 Nature Index, which tracks scientific output, five of the world's top ten academic institutions generating high-quality research were American and one was Chinese. Today, the Trump administration is allowing scientific discovery and technological innovation to become collateral damage amid a culture war on universities. Vice President JD Vance has explained the political impetus for upending U.S. universities very clearly in a February 2024 interview with The European Conservative: “We should be really aggressively reforming them in a way to where they're much more open to conservative ideas.” But is the perceived liberal bent of universities a reason to sow chaos in a research system that is key to U.S. national competitiveness? If a researcher can find a way to prevent cancer or Alzheimer's, it should not matter whether they are conservative or liberal. In just a few months in office, the Trump administration has already managed to inflict a remarkable amount of damage on the country's research enterprise—damage that will have lasting effects. This includes hollowing out research agency staffs and freezing the process by which grants are awarded. The administration has also canceled already-awarded grants deemed to be in violation of executive orders, such as those related to gender identity or diversity, equity, and inclusion, or at disfavored institutions such as Columbia University. Trump's proposed 2026 budget would starve U.S. science, including by cutting the budget of the National Institutes of Health by about 40 percent and that of the National Science Foundation by roughly 57 percent. But with its funding cuts, academic censorship, and hostile immigration policies, the Trump administration is provoking a brain drain. European universities are now gladly recruiting that U.S. scientific talent. Research centers in cities including Barcelona and Madrid are reporting dozens of applications from U.S. scientists. Freezes and cuts in research funding have also had an immediate impact on the next generation of talent. The United States clearly could do a better job of developing homegrown talent for these fields, but it is important to recognize how much the country gains by attracting brilliant people from around the world. The overwhelming majority of international doctoral students educated in the United States intend to stay on in the United States after earning their degrees, including more than three out of four doctoral recipients from China. And these students contribute to the U.S. economy; the National Foundation for American Policy's most recent analysis found that 25 percent of U.S. billion-dollar startup companies have a founder who came to the country as an international student. But increasingly, the best international students have other choices. Fraught confrontations at U.S. borders are now reportedly making foreign scientists hesitate before coming to scientific conferences. In March, for example, a French scientist who works in space research was detained and denied entry when attempting to travel to a conference near Houston. U.S. officials claimed that he was turned away because he had confidential information from Los Alamos National Laboratory, but French officials said that he was denied because his phone contained messages critical of the Trump administration's science policies. If the United States cannot even convene the world's best scientists, it will struggle to preserve the open exchange and free inquiry that it has championed for so long—and that science thrives on. The Trump administration seems to be taking U.S. leadership in science and technology for granted. Americans are accustomed to U.S. companies delivering astonishing innovations with regularity, including the iPhone, cloud computing, the Tesla Model S, and ChatGPT. It became a leader because it has had the world's best system for science and innovation—a system that is now under attack from the Trump administration. They believed that the state should support such explorations—but not direct them. This model was so appealing that, in the nineteenth century, it was Germany that welcomed the world's best and brightest: about 10,000 U.S. scholars earned their doctorates or other advanced degrees in German universities. Some of those German-educated Americans founded the first U.S. research university, Johns Hopkins, in 1876. It focused on applied science and engineering rather than on theory, aiming to produce technically trained graduates for a young, industrializing country. He established the university's first major research laboratories. MIT quickly became a powerhouse in applied research done to benefit U.S. industry and society. And it was often conducted in partnership with the leading U.S. companies at that time, including AT&T and General Electric. Although industry support was a matter of financial survival, the experience of working with industry made MIT particularly adept at moving its inventions into the marketplace. Compton had argued in 1927 that university research should not be focused merely on industry; he believed that universities were, in fact, the only places where pure science could be investigated without the pressures of commercialization. It was not until World War II that the federal government devoted a large quantity of tax dollars to university-based research, thanks to the leading engineer Vannevar Bush. Bush, while on the faculty at MIT, designed and built a pioneering analog computer. He also had a fantastic mind for science policy. In 1940, Roosevelt established the National Defense Research Committee with Bush as its leader. (Its power later expanded as it became the Office of Scientific Research and Development, with Bush still in charge.) Leading scientists, a number of whom would go on to win Nobel Prizes, were recruited from around the country to the Rad Lab. Over the next five years at MIT, more than 100 radar systems were developed to counteract the threat of German U-boats and V-1 flying bombs. The California Institute of Technology worked on rocketry. After Germany surrendered, Bush presented a landmark report to U.S. President Harry Truman titled Science: The Endless Frontier, in which he argued for the continuation of federal support for university-based research. Bush cited how decisive government-funded science had been to the Allied victory, including the development of scalable penicillin production, saving lives. And, as he pointed out, the United States could no longer rely on a “ravaged Europe” for fundamental discovery science as it had in the past. Bush's argument for the peacetime federal funding of research and scientific education was not only about national security and public health but also about economic growth. As he saw it, by continuing to “study nature's laws,” the United States could create new manufacturing industries and expand old ones—an assessment that turned out to be prescient. Just over a decade later, the MIT economist Robert Solow published groundbreaking research establishing that modern economic growth depends on technological advancements and not exclusively on capital and labor, as the classical paradigm had held—work for which he would win a Nobel Prize. Bush had a linear view of innovation: the federal government would give universities funds for basic research projects inspired by curiosity and not profit. These projects trained brilliant students and produced discoveries; industry would then develop those discoveries and find practical applications for them. Under this model, leading U.S. research universities both supported existing industries and became hotbeds of entrepreneurship themselves. In 2011, a study at Stanford University calculated that since the 1930s, its alumni and faculty had started nearly 40,000 companies that employed 5.4 million people and generated $2.7 trillion in annual revenues, putting Stanford among the world's ten largest economies. A similar MIT analysis found that as of 2014, MIT's living alumni had founded over 30,000 companies that employed 4.6 million people and generated nearly $2 trillion in annual revenues. The Bush model could certainly use some updating—and expansion—for a world in which China is pulling ahead of the United States in science and technology. Most Americans today were born long after Bush and The Endless Frontier. Throughout their lives, the United States has dominated in science, technology, industry, innovation, and culture, and they may assume that this is the natural order of things. Its military will suffer, because it depends on technologically advanced commercial products that the defense market alone cannot support. It will also see less growth among high-tech entrepreneurs. A 2021 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research confirmed the strong connection between increases in federal research support for a university and the formation nearby of startups with significant potential for growth. Another paper, published in 2020, detailed that university researchers who experienced large cuts in federal research funding are 80 percent less likely to launch a high-tech startup. Shoring up U.S. leadership in scientific innovation will require three things. This should include “use inspired” basic research, which takes place at the frontiers of science but is directed toward overcoming particular obstacles in U.S. economic or national security, as was the case at MIT's Rad Lab. The United States will also need to design immigration policies that allow its research universities to continue attracting the world's best science and engineering students and that allow those students to contribute to U.S. competitiveness by remaining in the country after they finish their education. Finally, the country needs to do a much better job of capturing the value of the discoveries and inventions made at U.S. universities, rather than allowing a lack of patient capital to drive critical technology manufacturing and development elsewhere. For example, a company named A123—spun out of the MIT Professor Yet-Ming Chiang's laboratory in 2001—was the first to commercialize a superior lithium-ion battery chemistry for electric vehicles. But because the U.S. market for EVs was not sufficiently developed for the company to become profitable, A123 declared bankruptcy in 2012 and was bought by a Chinese auto parts company. At MIT, about a decade ago, I became deeply concerned about this very issue—that some of the most groundbreaking science-based inventions emerging from our laboratories, despite their huge potential to benefit society, were not advancing to commercialization. The timeline to market for risky new technologies in fields such as regenerative medicine and clean energy is simply too long for most private investors—there is a reason that 39 percent of U.S. venture dollars go to software startups and just two percent go to energy startups. So MIT decided to create a combination accelerator and patient venture capital fund, called “The Engine,” for such “tough tech.” The Engine offers initial support to startups that have included Commonwealth Fusion Systems, a company that uses high-temperature superconducting magnets to develop small, low-cost fusion power systems. Although the CHIPS and Science Act authorized the National Science Foundation to help launch similar organizations, Congress has not yet funded this endeavor. The economies of Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea approach or surpass the United States in the proportion of GDP they devote to R & D, and China is working hard to catch up. U.S. government policies that fail to comprehend the importance of advancing science and technology are hastening this transition. The United States, once solidly on the frontlines of technology, is now on its way to becoming a much weaker player. There has never been anything inevitable about U.S. leadership in science and technology. What is inevitable is that if Washington does not work to maintain its lead on this battlefield, others will take its place.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Russian drone attack on Odesa Oblast on May 5 killed one and caused damage to local infrastructure, regional Governor Oleh Kiper reported. Russia regularly strikes civilian infrastructure with missile and drone attacks as it wages its war against Ukraine. Russia attacked border villages in Sumy Oblast on May 5, killing three residents and injuring seven others. Several houses were damaged in Odesa Oblast as a result of the attack, Kiper said in a post to Telegram. Additional information about the victims is being verified," Kiper said. Several fires broke out in the aftermath of Russia's drone attack, and emergency services worked to extinguish the fires, Kiper reported. On April 28, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a so-called "humanitarian" truce to take place beginning on May 8 in Russia's war against Ukraine to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. President Volodymyr Zelensky slammed Putin's proposal for a short-lived truce and pointed to Russia's strikes on civilian targets as proof that Russia does not want to end its war against Ukraine. That's why we believe — and the world believes — that there is no reason to wait until May 8," Zelensky said. Ukraine has insisted on a full 30-day unconditional ceasefire.</p>
