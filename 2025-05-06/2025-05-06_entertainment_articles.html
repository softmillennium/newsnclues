                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The apocalyptic sci-fi series was produced in Argentina and largely in and around Buenos Aires where it is set – with international collaboration coming into play for the VFX and post-production elements. It does not break out production budgets, but said its measure takes in the wider impact on GDP. Netflix Dates Noah Baumbach's 'Jay Kelly' Starring George Clooney & Adam Sandler 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming Telling the story of what happens after a deadly snow descends, The Eternaut has quickly topped Netflix's global top ten for non-English-language series. Netflix is keen to talk up its local production credentials and how it is boosting the film and TV sector in various countries. LatAm programming boss Francisco ‘Paco' Ramos has told Deadline that the aim of its local spending is to generate hits but also to buoy the industry in the territories where it is commissioning. One Hundred Years of Solitude spurred the Colombian economy to the tune of  $52M, per Netflix's figures and as reported in our scoop from last December. It counters talk of levies on international streamers, which are designed to boost homegrown production, and which are being introduced and debated in many countries. The Eternaut is an adaptation of the classic graphic novel by Héctor G. Oesterheld, illustrated by Francisco Solano López and first published in 1957. The series was created and directed by Bruno Stagnaro and produced by Buenos Aires-based K&S Films. Netflix's Ramos and K&S Producer Matías Mosteirin teased some details in a Deadline interview last week. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After an exhausting three years of trying to start a family, Laura Vandervoort says she and her fiancé Adam Coates have decided to give in vitro fertilization (IVF) one final try. The Hallmark actress, who last starred in 2023's hit “Miracle in Bethlehem, PA” opposite Benjamin Ayres and just finished filming a new holiday movie, bravely opened up to her fans on May 1, 2025. Captioning a time lapse video of giving herself injections and undergoing procedures as part of the invitro fertilization process, Vandervoort, 40, wrote, “We have just completed our 4th IVF round with the retrieval yesterday. Engaged to Coates since September 2023, Vandervoort shared in her vulnerable post, “I think we can say we are basically pros at this point when it comes to IVF injections, medications, procedures and the excruciatingly long waiting process.” 3 years of injections and appointments … we've decided that this is our final round.” Before this process, most women receive hormone shots of hormones that help their eggs develop. Hundreds of friends and fans rallied around Vandervoort in the comment section of her post, including one who wrote, “Sending you all the positive energy and my best wishes. I hope you feel surrounded by love, strength, and support, even from afar. Another shared, “Having done it myself, IVF is a tough and draining path to travel. That more people don't share their stories to help others through it. The “Playing Cupid” star opened up about what an emotional rollercoaster the process and desire to get pregnant can be, sharing, “Regardless of the scientific fact that so much is out of our control, we as women feel like we aren't enough, we are inadequate… that something is wrong with us as women. This feeling swirls around in our bodies and minds which makes the process even more difficult.” Our partners (if you choose to have one) often feel useless and wish they could take on more of the process. Vandervoort shared that she'd silently suffered through the trials and tribulations of failed IVF rounds, including playing a new mom in “Miracle in Bethlehem, PA,” reminding people that they never know what someone else is going through. Other Hallmark stars have also shared their own IVF journeys over the last year. New mom Torrey DeVitto revealed in July 2024 that she got pregnant through IVF and described how difficult the process was for her. Meanwhile, Taylor Cole shared on April 26 how hard her own journey to get pregnant has been, noting that “if sharing my journey can bring even one person a little bit of comfort, or help someone feel seen in their own struggle, then it's more than worth it.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Donald Trump advises the American public on how to save some money — buy fewer dolls, five pencils max — to counteract the effects of tariff-induced price increases, he's making clear that cost-saving measures don't apply to his office decor budget. “You see the new and improved Oval Office,” Trump said to Carney. “As it becomes more and more beautiful with love — you know we handle it with great love — and 24-karat gold, that always helps too.” Who needs dignified classicism when you can make one of the most famous rooms on the planet look like an overstuffed and inbred cousin of Versailles? Trump has decked out every mantle and surface he can see with gold-plated vases, moldings, and reliefs of a canary yellow that screeches nouveau riche petulance at all who behold it. Earlier this week, in that very same office, Trump defended himself to NBC News when asked on Sunday about comments he'd made a few days earlier about how Americans could cut back on their spending by only purchasing three to five dolls for their little girls, instead of 30, as his tariffs take a toll on consumers. Only a man who has never stressed over a credit card payment would think that the children of this nation are being gifted 30 dolls — or other toys — at any given time, or even that they would accumulate that many over years. Piper Rockelle Has a Lot to Say About That Netflix Documentary Yet Another GOP Town Hall Descends Into Chaos as Constituents Revolt Americans are already beginning to feel the effects of higher prices. No major tariff deals have been announced even as Trump claims he's in negotiations with dozens of countries. As domestic stockpiles and inventories of goods dwindle, things are only going to get worse. But don't worry, while you struggle to stretch your budget, you can sleep easy knowing the president's office is full of love — and 24-karat gold.</p>

So I think that will give a slightly different view of Paris than usual,” he added. Cinefrance Studios is producing the film, with David Gauquié, Julien Deris, Jean-Luc Ormières, and Renan Artukmaç serving as producers. Hiroko Matsuda, Kosuke Oshida, Yuji Sadai are also producing for the Japanese distributors Office Shirous and Bitters End. The film is being shopped to international buyers at the Cannes Marche du Film next week, but it already has distribution in both Japan and France.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Revlon's Elizabeth Arden made millions selling Britney's fragrances for years, but went to court last year over claims that its own execs took her business to an upstart rival. Revlon has fully settled a corporate espionage lawsuit that claimed several former employees “sabotaged” the company's decades-old fragrance partnership with Britney Spears. The case, filed last year by Revlon and its Elizabeth Arden unit, accused four ex-staffers of stealing trade secrets and breaching their contracts by taking the Britney account to upstart rival Give Back Beauty – a move the lawsuit described as a “heist.” But over the past few months, Revlon has quietly struck deals to resolve those claims – first with Give Back Beauty and one of the execs in February, then last week with three more ex-staffers. “It's always been a way for me to connect with my fans, who I love. Spears first inked a deal with Elizabeth Arden in 2004, launching her “Curious” scent later that year to a reported $100 million in sales. But last year Spears declined to renew the deal and instead signed with Give Back Beauty, an Italian firm founded in 2017. Faced with the loss of a valuable partnership, Revlon went the legal route – claiming that Britney had not simply walked away, but had been illegally poached by Give Back Beauty. The lawsuit claimed four Arden staffers (Vanessa Kidd, Dominick Romeo, Reid Mulvihill and Ashley Fass) had secretly helped orchestrate the star's departure, including one who allegedly “acted as a double-agent” – working directly with Give Back Beauty while ostensibly negotiating with Britney's team to renew her Revlon deal. “Revlon and Elizabeth Arden were completely unaware that Revlon's own team was actively sabotaging one of their most valuable licensing relationships,” the company's lawyers claimed at the time. Spears herself was not named in the lawsuit nor accused of any wrongdoing. Give Back Beauty and the former execs strongly denied the allegations, arguing in a later legal response that Revlon had gone to court with a “false narrative” of espionage and corporate raiding simply because it was angry that it had been beaten by a competitor. “Revlon's motion is … an anticompetitive ruse to damage a competitor because Revlon, weakened in the market by its recent bankruptcy, cannot compete fairly with GBB, and seeks to frustrate GBB's transition of Britney Brands, at the same time, sending a warning about future competition from an international rival that poses a growing threat to Revlon's market share,” the smaller company's lawyers wrote at the time. But by February, despite the strongly-word legal broadsides, Give Back Beauty and Revlon had apparently struck a deal to end their dispute. “We are looking forward to building on that legacy, introducing innovations to her product lines and expanding the brand into new markets globally, while ensuring that the spirit and authenticity of her brand remain intact.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pete Hegseth has already displayed a predictable lack of competence in his role as defense secretary, but it's not just a sloppy use of Signal chats that has forced the White House to do damage control on his behalf. According to a Tuesday report from Reuters, early in his tenure Hegseth cancelled military aid to Ukraine without a direct order from President Donald Trump. The pause, which Hegseth ordered just days after Trump was sworn in, led the U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) to ground 11 flights moving weapons and artillery to Ukraine. According to Reuters, when Ukrainian and Polish officials reached out to the White House to ask what was going on, officials in the Pentagon, State Department, and the president's office caught unaware that any such pause had been ordered. Records reviewed by Reuters showed that Hegseth had given a verbal order to halt the weapons shipments shortly after attending an Oval Office meeting where cutting military aid to Ukraine was discussed — but not ordered. The White House claimed that Hegseth had followed a directive from Trump aligned with the administration's policy towards Ukraine at that time, but other sources who spoke to Reuters and were aware of the events as they unfolded said U.S. National Security Officials and others who would typically be involved in such a decision had no idea the order had been made. It's another instance in which sloppy communication problems — either in excess or absence — have caused embarrassment to the defense secretary and the administration. According to a Monday report from The Wall Street Journal, Hegseth has used Signal — which is only approved for extremely limited, unclassified communication use by the Pentagon — much more extensively than previously known. Sources who spoke to the WSJ say the defense secretary has made over a dozen Signal chats to discuss all manner of DOD policy and issues with relevant parties — including representatives from foreign governments and partner nations. According to the sources, Hegseth has used Signal to discuss potentially sensitive information both on his personal phone, and on unsecure lines in the Pentagon. Buria was, according to sources, the individual who posed air strike plans against the Houthis in a chat with Hegseth's wife and brother. Hegseth, however, seems to prefer the convenience of a third-party application. The Pentagon will continue to exist in a state of uncertainty so long as Hegseth is at its helm.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The cable news network said Tuesday that it had hired Choire Sicha, the creator of the New York-based culture website which published daily ruminations on city weather under a motto of “Be Less Stupid,” to lead its new effort at editorial features. Sicha, who most recently was editor at large at New York magazine and also led the Styles desk at The New York Times, will join CNN as svp of features editorial on May 19. At WHCD Weekend, Glam With a (Small) Dash of Dystopia White House Correspondents' Dinner Focuses on Awards, Journalism as Trump Snubs Comic-Free Soirée After layoffs were made in January — about 6 percent of jobs, or 200 staffers — CNN has been stocking up on editorial talent, including many senior hires who had previously worked on its short-lived Jeff Zucker-era subscription product, CNN+. (That $300 million service, which was scrapped after less than a month, was a casualty of AT&T's spinoff of parent Warner Bros. to Discovery in 2022.) In April this year, the company rehired CNN+ alum Amanda Wills from The Wall Street Journal, as chief content officer, and a month earlier Nancy Han also rejoined the cable news outlet as svp, video editorial. Overseeing CNN's business is former New York Times president Mark Thompson, who in January outlined his moves including investing $70 million in digital (“Some of that money's going in product and tech, but a lot is also going into new high-quality journalism and storytelling,” he wrote in a memo). And there are also plans afoot for a “lifestyle-oriented digital product” as well as a new standalone streaming service for the news brand outside of its parent company Warner Bros. Discovery's Max platform (which now has 117 million global subscribers).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shortly before arriving at the Met Gala in New York City on Monday (May 5), Rihanna revealed that she's pregnant with her third child with partner A$AP Rocky. So not surprisingly, in addition to discussing what she was wearing for fashion's biggest night, there were questions about whether growing her family would mean delaying her already long-awaited ninth studio album. When asked about that on the blue carpet, Ri — who was in a custom Marc Jacobs — had a very confident answer. “Noooooo!” she insisted about the upcoming album's arrival to Entertainment Tonight before admitting some things might come a little later. The “Umbrella” singer — who shares sons RZA, nearly 3, and Riot Rose, 1, with Rocky — also joked earlier on to reporters as she was walking the carpet at the star-studded event that she “brought the kid!” Though she was dressed to the nines and in high heels, she told ET that she was feeling good that night. “I'm shockingly feeling OK and not too overwhelmed at the moment,” she shared before admitting that perhaps her third pregnancy did have her feeling a little bit overwhelmed in the beginning. “At first, it was kinda like, ‘Ahhhhhhhh,' and ‘I'm tired,'” the nine-time Grammy winner said. “We were tired of holding that, and it was time to show the people what we was cooking up,” he told the Associated Press. And hopefully soon, Ri's Navy will also be happy with the eventual arrival of R9. The “Disturbia” singer last released an album nearly a decade ago when she dropped Anti in February 2016. Ri shared in her March Harper's Bazaar cover story that contrary to what she called “way off” rumors, the album would not be reggae. “After a while, I looked at it, and I was like, this much time away from music needs to count for the next thing everyone hears. After waiting eight years, you might as well just wait some more.” Watch Ri talk about R9 and her pregnancy with ET above.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Baywatch babe Pamela Anderson was rocking two eye-catching accessories at the May 5 Met Gala. The other- her oldest son with rocker Tommy Lee- 28-year-old Brandon Thomas Lee. The 57-year-old actress wore a sparkly, bejewelled long-sleeve Tory Burch gown encrusted with layers of intricate beading, jewels and sequins. And while she kept true to her new look of minimal makeup, she did add a diamond Pandora ear cuff to complete the fit. A post shared by Good Morning America (@goodmorningamerica) Pamela Anderson summed up how she felt about her look for the Met Gala in three words. In an Instagram post showing her from every angle, she wrote: ‘Bold… Brave… Precise. And her fans were quick to agree, including singer Katy Perry. The pop star commented: ‘One of my favorite looks! Perry has sported some of the most iconic looks of the Met Gala in years past, but was not at this year's event. Fans and followers on Instagram gushed: ‘WOW this hair and this look are perfection love the hair!!! Others commented on her timeless, old Hollywood look, writing, “Pam is so naturally beautiful, her profile is amazing. She reminds me of Mia Farrow with her hair like this 😍” Pamela brings timeless glam to the Met. Pandora, who Anderson is a spokesperson for, also chimed in with “An absolutely incredible look! It is an honor to have our jewelry worn by you at the Met Gala again. Anderson's oldest son, Brandon Thomas Lee, kept his look simple with a classic black tuxedo by Genuardi. And this isn't the first time Brandon has been Pam's plus one. A post shared by Brandon Thomas Lee (@brandonthomaslee) He was her date to this year's Golden Globes, when Anderson was nominated for her performance in “The Last Showgirl.” In an Instagram post about the night, Lee wrote, “Such a wonderful evening and so incredibly proud of @pamelaanderson for all she has accomplished with her film The @lastshowgirl . With only 18 days to shoot and a small budget this film and your performance stand amongst the giants it was nominated next to. I can't wait to see where we go from here 🙏”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From theatrical trains to ultra-wide shoulders, this year's (relatively few) truly compelling red-carpet outfits were the bolder interpretations of the Black dandyism theme. Superfine is inspired by the scholar Monica L. Miller's excellent book Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity, a cultural history of Black dandyism and its most influential sartorial figures, and Andrew Bolton, head curator at the Institute, tapped Miller to help build the exhibition. 'F1' Star Damson Idris Definitely Had the Coolest Met Gala Carpet Reveal Pre-Loved Designer Jewelry Makes Its Mark on the Met Gala Blue Carpet “Who will do this well?” I asked my friend, as if she were an oracle. The best-dressed guests found distinctive modes of self-expression within these capacious parameters. These outfits — like Lauryn Hill's gorgeous yellow get-up or Teyana Taylor's intimate maroon costume — embodied what dandy artist and special consultant to the exhibition Iké Udé called “future perfect.” Their clothes radiated a visionary and forward-thinking energy. The more underwhelming outfits stayed within the realm of convention, leaning more heavily into precise tailoring than a radical vision of fashion. These were mostly forgettable ensembles, clothes that would not cause a stir and are likely to fade with time (see Sydney Sweeney in Miu Miu and Nicole Kidman in Balenciaga.) It's notable that most of them were worn by white celebrities, who seemed to struggle in their interpretation of this year's theme. There were few egregious faux pas, but I will be contemplating why BlackPink member Lisa's custom Louis Vuitton one piece, which featured embroidered portraits by the artist Henry Taylor, included a figure who bears a striking resemblance to Rosa Parks right on her crotch area. LeBron James, who was named honorary chair, could not attend because of a knee injury. His wife, Savannah James, still attended, wearing a custom burgundy pinstripe suit designed by Hanifa, the label run by Congolese designer Anifa Mvuemba. Wintour didn't stray from her usual uniform in her custom silver dress by Louis Vuitton (they are the exhibition sponsors) and a powder blue coat; Williams, who serves as Men's Creative Director of Louis Vuitton, left much to be desired despite the flair of his double-breasted blazer made of 100,000 pearls. Hamilton, A$AP Rocky and Domingo were the winners among this group of gala helmers, with looks that either embraced the drama of Black style or the finer details that define Black dandyism's legacy. Hamilton wore an ivory ensemble designed by Grace Wales Bonner and a beret by Stephen Jones Millinery that gestured toward Barkley L. Hendricks portraits and told a story through its jeweled embellishments, from the baobab flower affixed to his lapel to the cowrie shells and pearls dotting his jacket tail. Domingo's outfit was a double whammy of Black queer history and personal style. Later, Domingo sloughed off that layer to reveal another Valentino get-up: a double-breasted wool jacket embellished with pearls and crystals, a black neck scarf with hand-painted white polka dots, and wide-leg wool trousers. The understated playfulness of Hamilton's attire found echoes in other outfits from the evening — including Jenna Ortega's dazzling form-fitting Balmain dress constructed entirely out of metal rulers, as well as Balmain creative director Olivier Rousteing's metal sewing machine-shaped bag and gold metal shirt under his wide-shoulder suit. Zendaya, who surprised guests at the Met Gala last year with two distinct red carpet outfits, opted for a subtler look this year. Working with co-conspirator Law Roach, who also styled Tyla, Jeremy Pope, Jon Batiste, Nicki Minaj and Andre 3000, Zendaya channelled Bianca Jagger's bridal look with a deftly tailored cream silk suit from Louis Vuitton and a complementary wide-brimmed hat. I would be remiss not to mention Kerry Washington's custom piece from Simkhai, which featured a plunging neckline, an organza-like A-line skirt, mesh gloves and a matching cream hat. I'm thinking about Diana Ross's gasp-worthy outfit designed by Ugo Mozie with its 18-foot train, which had the names of her children and grandchildren embroidered into it. Or Teyana Taylor's outfit, which was designed in collaboration with Academy-Award winning costume designer Ruth E. Carter. Her outfit felt particularly meaningful when she, conducting red carpet interviews for Vogue with Ego Nwodim (in Christopher John Rogers), spoke to Harlem legend Dapper Dan. How beautiful it was to see two Harlem icons, past and present, talking about what this evening means for their futures. Other dramatic storytellers included Whoopi Goldberg, Al Sharpton, Doja Cat, Brian Tyree Henry, Jodi Turner-Smith (in a stunning burgundy Burberry suit that paid homage to Black equestrian Selika Lazevski) and Damson Idris, who had handlers tear off his F1 suit (complete with a bedazzled helmet) to reveal a three-piece crimson suit by Tommy Hilfiger. There was also Janelle Monae, who collaborated with Oscar-winning costume designer Paul Tazewell (Wicked) and Thom Browne to create a costume that bent time. The exterior garment was a striking red, white and black pinstripe jacket that looked like an optical illusion. Monae continued that motif in the interior, which featured a more fitted two-piece skirt-and-jacket combo. She completed the look with a top hat and cheeky monocle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>André 3000 has surprise-released a new instrumental project dubbed 7 Piano Sketches. As the name suggests, it's a seven-song collection that centers around piano, with the individual tracks prefaced by himself, Emmy Paalman, or Fatima Robinson reading off the song titles. Vocal effects and occasional samples, like a laugh track on “Off Rhythm Laughter,” also intermittently appear. “The original title for it was The Best Worst Rap Album in History,” André 3000 said in a press release. “And here is an excerpt from the original liner notes: ‘It's jokingly the worst rap album in history because there are no lyrics on it at all. Partially composed and recorded prior to New Blue Sun, 7 Piano Sketches first took shape nearly a decade ago when André 3000 stayed in a sparse Texas house with his son that only had a piano, two beds, and a few TV screens. “Having lived with the recordings for a time, André was drawn to the idea of creating more and sharing them in the Spring, a time of year that promises that life, creativity, and possibility are ever-renewing,” a press release elaborates. It's no coincidence that André 3000 dropped this new project late at night. He timed the release to align with his appearance at the 2025 Met Gala in New York, where he wore a bespoke piano by Burberry on his back, in collaboration with Benji Bixby—an evolution of Benjamin Bixby, André 3000's late aughts fashion line—and styled by Law Roach. That served as the Outkast rapper's debut solo LP, and it earned him three Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year. The 2024 short film Moving Day, directed by Dexter Navy, documented the making of New Blue Sun and included a previously unreleased track from those recording sessions.
