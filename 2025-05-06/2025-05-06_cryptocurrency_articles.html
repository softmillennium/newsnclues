                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin Stalls as Trump Vents Trade Frustrations Before Fed Decision The price of Bitcoin hovered around $95,000 on Tuesday as U.S. stocks fell on President Donald Trump's apparent frustrations regarding the status of trade negotiations. Alongside Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's visit to the White House, Trump pushed back against investors' growing sense of urgency for trade deals with nations caught up in his efforts to reshape global trade through “reciprocal” tariffs, per CNBC. Despite members of Trump's cabinet teasing deals with nations like India and Japan for weeks, the administration has yet to unveil an agreement with a foreign trading partner. During Congressional testimony on Tuesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled that negotiations are still ongoing with nations affected by Trump's “reciprocal” tariffs. However, in an apparent departure from Trump's previous comments regarding Chinese President Xi Jinping, Bessent said that China has yet to engage with the U.S. to negotiate “We are currently negotiating with 17 of those trading partners. China, we have not engaged in negotiations with, as of yet.” The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq each stumbled 0.4%, according to Yahoo Finance. Investors' retreat comes a day before the Federal Reserve is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady at the conclusion of its policy meeting. In determining its policy stance, Fed officials are likely to look through data points that came before Trump's “Liberation Day” announcement involving sweeping tariffs, Katalin Tischhauser, head of research at digital asset banking group Sygnum, told Decrypt. “Ahead of Liberation Day, imports have been fast-tracked and brought forward, skewing the GDP number,” she said. However, those odds could soon change when Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks take center stage. The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Samara Asset Group's Bitcoin CPI reframes inflation by measuring prices in BTC—offering corporate treasuries a clearer benchmark for real value. In corporate finance, inflation is often accepted as an unavoidable force—something to hedge against, but never escape. Every fiscal model, investment thesis, and capital plan ultimately bends around it. But the way we measure inflation is rarely questioned. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), the world's default inflation gauge, measures price changes of a basket of goods in fiat currency. But here's the problem: fiat currencies are designed to lose value. This means we're measuring rising prices with a yardstick that's shrinking. Now, Samara Asset Group, an executive member of Bitcoin For Corporations (BFC), is challenging that convention. They've launched the world's first Bitcoin Consumer Price Index (BTCCPI)—a bold new benchmark that prices the same CPI basket in Bitcoin instead of fiat. Traditional CPI always trends upward, not necessarily because goods become more valuable, but because the purchasing power of fiat currency is constantly eroded by inflationary policy. By expressing the same CPI basket in Bitcoin, the index reflects what happens when measured against a supply-capped, non-sovereign monetary standard. And what it reveals is striking: over the long term, prices trend downward. But across longer timeframes, Bitcoin holds purchasing power far better than fiat. This is not just a reframing of inflation. It's a more honest way to assess whether capital is holding its value—or being silently diluted. Corporate finance teams think in terms of performance, preservation, and predictability. But preservation is the one that's hardest to measure—especially in fiat terms. The BTCCPI offers an emerging class of Bitcoin Treasury Companies a new tool: a way to benchmark the real-world strength of their treasury strategy. This changes the story you can tell shareholders. That you're anchoring corporate value to a global, neutral, incorruptible base layer. In that light, BTCCPI is more than a chart. It's a live, data-driven benchmark—transparent, methodologically grounded, and freely available to the public. Samara is showing how a Bitcoin-native company can contribute to the broader corporate finance toolkit—building infrastructure that serves investors, treasurers, analysts, and decision-makers beyond its own business. It also signals something deeper: that Bitcoin is no longer content to play defense. But each of those reflects a world built on fiat assumptions. It invites us to ask: what if we've been measuring inflation incorrectly? What if the signal we've been using to manage capital is inherently distorted? Thanks to Samara, we now have the beginning of an answer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three major crypto trade associations are urging the Senate to bring stablecoin legislation to the floor for debate this week, even as crypto-friendly Democrats threaten to vote down the bill over recent moves by Republican leadership. “A comprehensive regulatory framework will enable widespread and increased stablecoin adoption, which is essential to cementing U.S. dollar dominance in the digital economy,” Blockchain Association's Kristin Smith, Crypto Council for Innovation's Ji Kim and the Digital Chamber's Cody Carbone said in a statement Tuesday. “We are grateful for the significant strides the GENIUS Act has already made, and we hope to see meaningful refinements to further ensure U.S. leadership in digital finance,” they added. The pushback comes after Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) moved to expedite consideration of the bill last Thursday. “We have approached this process constructively and with an open mind, with the understanding that additional improvements to the bill would be made,” the senators said in a statement Saturday. “However, the bill as it currently stands still has numerous issues that must be addressed.” “It seems they want us to suck it up and vote for this bill without our input,” he wrote on the social platform X. Our statement makes clear we won't let them jam us. Gallego was one of several Senate Banking Democrats who voted to advance the GENIUS Act in March. However, crypto legislation appears to be hitting a wall in Washington, particularly as President Trump's growing ties to the industry face scrutiny. House Democrats walked out of a hearing on digital asset market structure legislation Tuesday, after Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) objected over the president and his family's recent crypto dealings. Trump and his family have fueled more criticism in recent days, after their crypto firm World Liberty Financial announced that Emirati firm MGX and crypto exchange Binance would use its new stablecoin to complete a $2 billion transaction.

According to Mihir (@RhythmicAnalyst), the Federal Reserve currently has no platform to launch a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), making stablecoins issued on public and private blockchains the only viable alternative for digital dollar settlements (source: Twitter, May 6, 2025). This development signals increased reliance on established USD-backed stablecoins like USDT and USDC, particularly on public blockchains, while banks are expected to utilize private blockchain-based stablecoins for institutional transfers. Traders should monitor potential demand surges and regulatory developments around major stablecoins, as well as the adoption rates of private blockchain solutions, since these factors could drive liquidity shifts and volatility in the broader cryptocurrency market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now the two banks are working together to support cross border payments using Custodia's Avit token on a permissionless blockchain. Vantage Bank's customer, courier firm DX Xpress, used the programmable dollar tokens for a payment between Mexico and the United States. A common real world use case often cited for digital currencies is conditional payments, such as paying for ecommerce purchases on delivery. DX Xpress is using it for this purpose and to pay drivers. “We see the capability to offer integrated, programmable U.S. dollar payments through our platform to speed up cash conversion cycles allowing for payments to be initiated via a smart contract at delivery and ultimately paying drivers for a completed route within the hour,” said Antonio Bazán, President and CEO of DX Xpress. While some refer to the token as a stablecoin, legally it is not. Additionally, holders of the token have rights and protections under the Uniform Commercial Code, something that stablecoin holders lack. Meanwhile, Custodia Bank has been battling to get a Federal Reserve master account for years, with no luck so far. That's despite the Kansas City Fed saying the bank was technically eligible in 2022, but was subject to approvals needed by banks engaging in blockchain and crypto. Now Custodia is looking to partner with other banks who are interested in deploying tokenized deposits.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seemingly overnight a somewhat obscure category of contemporary art took center stage, alongside a powerful and nebulous technology – ‘the blockchain.' After a period of frenzied crypto-oriented experimentation, arts organizations began slowing down and thinking about this technology on longer timescales. An emerging group of artists and institutions have begun exploring how the core components of blockchains – decentralization and encryption – can help preserve culture for the next 100 years and unlock new potentials for cooperative data stewardship. These transactions are preserved on the blockchain's ‘immutable public ledger' as a lasting record of an exchange. Engagement initiatives are primarily led by development and educational departments within the institution, and take the form of ticketing, participatory programming, or new membership models. These initiatives aim to cultivate a new donor class or grow audience, and oftentimes are presented under the auspices of tech literacy. For example, the MoMA Postcard project, a “participatory blockchain art project,” was framed as “an invitation for anyone to learn, experiment, collaborate, and create value together with web3 technologies.” More recently the Metropolitan Museum of Art launched ArtLinks, a blockchain-based game which “presents an innovative way to engage with the Museum.” A similar focus on transactions is at the core of the second category, Collecting. The standard for preservation-grade storage is ‘3 copies, in 3 locations,' and archivists have long adopted the mantra ‘lots of copies keep stuff safe.' Immutable and verifiable storage on blockchains like Filecoin offers additional benefits, with cryptographic proofs that archives are being stored in their original form. Storing the bits and bytes that make up an archival information package on the blockchain – as opposed to a single display copy or on-chain code snippet included in NFTs – requires a deep engagement with the infrastructure and departments within an institution. Such an initiative at a traditional museum would require collaboration across curatorial, registrar, collections, and conservation, which handles identity and iteration reports, treatment plans, condition assessments, and other essential documentation that ensures a born-digital artwork will last 100 years. The Internet Archive is leveraging decentralized storage for its collections, which has become a crucial cultural record at this moment as information disappears from the internet. The Prelinger Library boasts an essential collection of cultural ephemera, and is exploring how decentralized storage can ensure the longevity of their collection and offer more resilient and censorship-resistant access to the data in their sprawling archives. University archives such as Harvard's Library Innovation Lab are enhancing discovery and engagement with open data and exploring new ways to preserve digital information using decentralized storage. Institutions experimenting with blockchain-backed preservation are leading the way for a huge shift in the way we understand our data. Culture at large is coming into an awareness of the precarity of data and the value it represents.Technology companies have amassed huge fortunes from user-generated data, and the political implications of the extractive practices of these giants have come into view. Mass exodus from social media platforms and divestment from big tech is shifting the landscape of how we understand the power of our data. One group of artists is working to explore how blockchain-backed storage can shift the value of data to creators. By leveraging these technologies to explore distributive justice and data sovereignty, they are prototyping a new system of value for data. By leveraging the power of blockchain-backed encryption to take ownership of data in a new way, they are demonstrating a different path forward for cultural legacy. Such a shift will require careful collaboration and value realignment across the cultural sector. The momentous shift of NFTs was driven by rapid speculation, but the transformative power of blockchain technologies is operating on a much longer timescale. At its core, blockchain is an immutable public ledger which is actively recording a great shift in power across sectors.Traditional art institutions engaging more deeply with this technology beyond tokenization will activate a new era of cultural value creation.

Culture at large is coming into an awareness of the precarity of data and the value it represents.Technology companies have amassed huge fortunes from user-generated data, and the political implications of the extractive practices of these giants have come into view. Mass exodus from social media platforms and divestment from big tech is shifting the landscape of how we understand the power of our data. One group of artists is working to explore how blockchain-backed storage can shift the value of data to creators. By leveraging these technologies to explore distributive justice and data sovereignty, they are prototyping a new system of value for data. The initiative seeks to create a ‘proof of concept' for resilient cultural infrastructure which is fully owned by the creators themselves, freeing data from the hands of big tech. By leveraging the power of blockchain-backed encryption to take ownership of data in a new way, they are demonstrating a different path forward for cultural legacy. Such a shift will require careful collaboration and value realignment across the cultural sector. The momentous shift of NFTs was driven by rapid speculation, but the transformative power of blockchain technologies is operating on a much longer timescale. At its core, blockchain is an immutable public ledger which is actively recording a great shift in power across sectors.Traditional art institutions engaging more deeply with this technology beyond tokenization will activate a new era of cultural value creation. Her curatorial focus is on artists refiguring technology through critical practice. Her independent curatorial projects include HeK (House of Electronic Arts), Arebyte, Pioneer Works, Gray Area, Christie's New York, Carl & Marilynn Thoma Foundation, and Pérez Art Museum Miami.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's something that happens when BTC cools down, traders begin hunting for faster-moving plays with more upside. This May, that shift is already underway, with smaller projects picking up momentum. Coins tied to AI, staking rewards, or early tech are showing signs of life. Dawgz AI is one of the newer names getting noticed in that space. Every time Bitcoin slows down, something interesting happens – attention shifts. Traders and investors start looking elsewhere, often rotating profits into altcoins that haven't run yet. It's not new, but the timing this May feels different. BTC's dominance has started to flatten, and smart money is already moving into smaller plays with more potential upside. Altcoins benefit from this shift because they tend to move faster, especially when liquidity loosens up. Some altcoins are already picking up momentum while Bitcoin takes a breather. Dawgz AI is one of the newer altcoins catching early traction, and it's easy to see why. The presale price is currently set at $0.004, and it's already raised over $3.4 million, which shows strong early interest heading into mid-2025. If you're looking to dig deeper into $DAGZ, check the video below where crypto enthusiast ClayBro explains why Dawgz AI is one of the top altcoins to invest in right now. While it may not be the flashiest altcoin on the list, it's one of the most structurally sound projects, with real tech, a solid user base, and long-term positioning in areas like DeFi, tokenization, and payments. Its circulating supply stands at 8.59 billion out of a 10B max, which gives it more room to grow without massive inflation risk. The project also benefits from a high-performance blockchain that can handle thousands of transactions per second with low fees and near-instant finality. Stellar is one of those projects that's been around for years but still holds weight in conversations about altcoins with real-world use. It's built for fast, low-cost payments and cross-border transfers, a problem that actually needs solving in crypto. That real utility is what keeps XLM relevant even in sideways markets. Its circulating supply is 30.92 billion XLM out of a 50B max, giving it both liquidity and long-term flexibility. What makes Stellar stand out is how it's stayed focused. And right now, May feels like one of those in-between moments where the next wave is starting to build quietly. It's when smart money starts rotating, loading up on altcoins before broader momentum kicks in. Coins like Dawgz AI, Stellar, and Algorand are already showing signs of accumulation. Bitcoin's slowed down, altcoins are starting to wake up, and May feels like one of those moments where the market's setting up for something. Some projects are gaining traction quietly, like Dawgz AI, which has picked up steady interest during its presale phase. If history repeats, the next move won't begin with a headline. Dawgz AI is one of the few coins being watched for 1000x potential, mainly because of its low presale price, small market cap, and early traction. While nothing is guaranteed in crypto, early-stage projects with utility and strong tokenomics tend to offer the best setups for massive upside. Dawgz AI currently shows some of the most potential among emerging altcoins, especially with its mix of AI functionality, staking rewards, and growing community support. The presale is still active, and the project offers features that go beyond hype, like trading bots, a working roadmap, and a clear use case. Dawgz AI has a shot at becoming one of the altcoins to explode in 2025, especially if AI narratives continue to gain steam.</p>

In this way, you can forget about translating articles from Spanish into awkward English that probably don't make much sense. Let us be your convenient and essential guide to all things that will likely affect you as a foreign resident living in Spain. Around eight years have passed since the booming era of ICOs. It was a time when hundreds, perhaps thousands, of crypto projects collectively raised billions, primarily based on a lot of hype around blockchain technology. However, one of the few ICO projects still actively innovating that deserves mention today is Electroneum, a British-born and based blockchain company. Nearly a decade down the line and over four million users later, Electroneum continues to innovate. They have built and maintained one of the fastest blockchains with transaction finality in five seconds or less and transaction fees as low as .0001 ETN. Electroneum's mobile-first approach was and continues to be unique. For many years, Electroneum benefited hundreds of thousands of users in African, Asian, and Latin American countries, where very little goes a long way. Unlike Pi Network, which allows mobile phone mining for tokens with no clear use case, Electroneum's mobile mining era (until 2019) rewarded mining participants with approximately $3 worth of ETN, enough to purchase monthly airtime and data in many developing countries. Given their achievements, it came as no surprise that in 2019, Electroneum received City AM's Crypto Award for Social Impact and Sustainability. In a 2019 article, top-tier crypto news outlet Coindesk lauded Electroneum's launch of an $80 “dirt-cheap” M1 Android smartphone that rewarded users with crypto. No other crypto project had come up with this brilliant idea. Inspired by them, others would soon follow, such as Solana. By the way, it's still available on eBay for under $30, because they later decided to drop the price to make it even more accessible for those with less financial means. Their CEO and Founder, prominent British entrepreneur Richard Ells, focused more on providing millions of the financially excluded with crypto services that truly addressed their issues, such as instant payments and portability, even in marginalised communities. With that vision and mission in mind, the Electroenum leadership went to Cambodia, where they sealed a first-of-its-kind deal within the crypto industry. The agreement with the Asian country's largest mobile operator, Cellcard, meant ETN app users could top up their airtime and data using ETN. Additionally, Cellcard agreed to purchase one million M1 smartphones, which they displayed in their shops nationwide. The agreement also meant Cellcard users can earn ETN rewards of up to $3 per month, which they can convert into ETN tokens and top up their Cellcard accounts. This non-profit trade association represents the interests of more than 750 mobile network operators worldwide. Dozens of top crypto projects entered a downturn phase, and Electroneum has not been an exception. This brought on many external and internal challenges within their vast community. Support waned and disappointment grew, but all projects, even Ethereum, Cardano, and Ripple, have faced fierce criticism from experts as well as community leaders. That era, brought on in part by the COVID-19 global crisis and exacerbated by the crypto winter of 2022 that wiped out roughly $2 trillion worth of crypto asset, caused the collapse of many more blockchain projects, but forwardthinking as Ells has proven to be, he took advantage to build, paving the way for Electroneum's entrance into a new evolutionary phase. His team got busy focusing on expanding its blockchain capabilities, ecosystem, and global reach. The result is an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain powered by the Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance (IBFT) consensus mechanism, capable of 5-second transaction finality and ultra-low fees (as low as 0.0001 ETN). The upgrade enables smart contract functionality using Solidity and Vyper, making it easier for developers to build decentralised applications on the network. Its ecosystem includes the first decentralised Fiverr-like freelance platform, which was hugely well-received by thousands, if not tens of thousands, of financially excluded people worldwide. These individuals found they could earn ETH by completing digital tasks. Unlike most charitable organisations, the project also continues to work closely with some amazing NGOs that have genuinely proven their efforts to help women, children, and their families in the short, medium, and long term.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At 3 PM, when most of his peers are slowly finishing their workday, a 23-year-old man who goes by the name “0xExceed” is just beginning his. Over the next 14 hours, until about 5 AM, alongside his co-founders they'll manage their NFT project whilst coordinating with artists across multiple time zones, and engaging with a community of thousands. But in 2025, when most mainstream observers have written off NFTs as a passing fad, 0xExceed's dedication seems almost anachronistic. These projects have wildly different goals and communities: while Azuki's mission is ‘honoring anime's cultural legacy”, Pudgy Penguins floods Walmart with cute plush penguins and Remilia advances a political-cultural movement loosely defined as “network spirituality”. "People keep saying NFTs are dead, but our community remains passionate," says 0xExceed, whose "Pixel vs Pixel" art competition recently attracted hundreds of submissions from around the world. Despite NFT trading volumes down significantly from their 2021 peak, communities of creators and collectors continue to thrive. It's becoming easier to create content and build software applications," Finzer explained in a recent interview. "The big thesis we have is that crypto and blockchains are a key piece of infrastructure for all the things happening in tech right now." The raw numbers tell a dramatic story: NFT trade volumes have plummeted from their August 2021 peak of over $3.2 billion per week to current levels below $100 million. "There have been some substitutes for what NFTs represented early on in 2021," Finzer explained, pointing to the explosive rise of meme coins that have attracted billions of dollars in trading volume. Many successful NFT projects have also evolved by embracing their own ecosystem tokens, creating hybrid models that blend the community aspects of NFTs with the liquidity of fungible tokens. This market shift has occurred alongside fierce competition for NFT marketplace dominance. OpenSea's journey illustrates this volatility, with its market share plunging from over 70% in 2021 to as low as 15% in 2022, before recently rebounding to 58% following its platform upgrades and ecosystem token announcements. That's a much more healthy ecosystem than in 2021 when your cheapest NFT was at least $1,000 if not $5,000.” Counter-Strike skins recently hit an all-time high with a market cap approaching $5 billion. Fortunately for OpenSea, recent rulings, particularly the landmark recent court ruling between Apple and Epic Games, are set to transform NFT accessibility on mobile platforms. This ruling effectively ends Apple's monopoly on in-app payments, opening significant opportunities for NFT marketplaces like OpenSea. Finzer enthusiastically responded when asked about the impact of this ruling. "We just launched our open beta for what we're calling OS2, which is the brand new version of OpenSea, which lets you discover, and trade anything on chain." Finzer explained that this court decision directly addresses a major barrier: "The next things on our roadmap are really bringing that to mobile in the most delightful possible way for people to really get on board easily." He emphasized that "the Apple ruling is going to be great for that because the in-app purchase situation has held us back for a good amount of time." This change means users will soon be able to purchase NFTs directly through iOS apps without prohibitive fees. Previously, OpenSea's mobile app didn't allow purchases because Apple's 30% commission made it "cost prohibitive" for their peer-to-peer marketplace model. With these restrictions lifted, Finzer believes it will bring down the barriers to entry and be "great for consumers" who will have easier access to NFT experiences on mobile. The regulatory environment for NFTs and crypto more broadly has improved significantly, according to Finzer. Following recent political changes in the US, many investigations of crypto companies have been ended. One of the most compelling aspects of NFTs that has persisted through market fluctuations is their role in establishing digital identity and community membership. This was dramatically illustrated when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin changed his profile picture to Remilia Corporation's Milady NFT earlier this year, causing a significant market reaction. It really does give you immediate recognition of what that person stands for.” We've also seen community membership evolve in projects like Pudgy Penguins. What began in 2021 as chubby, playful flightless birds has morphed into a full‑blown consumer brand. Pudgy Penguins can now be found across toy‑store shelves and on viral TikTok videos. There's even a Solana‑based PENGU ecosystem token whose drop this year vaulted into the top 10 by trading volume. As founder Luca Netz puts it, ‘the Trojan horse for crypto adoption is IP,' and Pudgy's journey from niche collectible to mainstream merch proof‑points that thesis in action. At the same time, anime‑focused Azuki has leaned into storytelling and fan collaboration. Founder Alex ‘Zagabond' Xu describes Azuki's mission as “honoring anime's cultural legacy while pioneering new creator‑funding models.” Like many other projects, it now has its own ecosystem token. Over half of the ANIME token went to its NFT holders, which “underscored how digital communities can co‑own IP development, from story arcs to funding anime productions”. "With any new technology, there's always this period where things get really exciting. People get interested in the use cases, and there's this sort of period of mania, and that's really what we saw in 2021," he said. And I think that's what we've seen over the last couple of years.” This perspective aligns with what we've seen in other technological revolutions, from the internet itself to mobile applications. "OpenSea has really expanded from just being an NFT marketplace to being a place where you can discover, own, and trade anything on chain," Finzer noted, highlighting the platform's evolution beyond its original narrow focus. In fact, NFTs have been proving us they are more than “just NFTs”: From Azuki's community‑driven entry into the anime industry to Pudgy Penguins' toy‑line partnerships. This demonstrates NFTs' power as online programmable IP, not just digital JPEGs. One emerging trend that Finzer finds particularly interesting is the connection between physical items and NFTs. He highlighted Courtyard, which has been "doing significant revenue, significant volume" by allowing people to trade rare Pokemon cards represented as NFTs and then receive the actual physical item on demand. The rise of generative AI is creating new opportunities for NFTs, according to Finzer. As these AI-powered applications grow, Finzer believes many developers will want "some way to have unique digital ownership" within them, which is where NFTs can play a critical role. Interestingly, rather than seeing AI as a threat to NFT value, Finzer sees it enhancing the importance of provable digital ownership. "For digital art, where there's elements of human culture, I think you really even more so need a provable digital ownership layer," he said. Another notable example of NFTs powering gaming experiences is Claynosaurz. Their gaming experience is launching with Gameloft, a mainstream game publishing studio known for popular titles such as the Modern Combat series, The Amazing Spider-Man, Gods of Rome, and Despicable Me: Minion Rush. Moreover, the project earned recognition at the 2025 Collision Awards, a prestigious event that honors excellence in animation across all disciplines including film, television, and gaming. Claynosaurz's 3D dinosaur characters won in multiple categories, showcasing how NFT projects can produce animation quality that stands alongside traditional entertainment giants. Despite the ups and downs of the NFT market, Finzer remains convinced that digital ownership will be a fundamental part of our increasingly online lives.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A potent mix of political showmanship and landmark regulatory proposals in the U.S. this month could be the spark for an explosive altcoin season. A new Digital Asset Market Structure Discussion Draft from House Republicans is on the legislative table, promising market democratization and clearer rules, favoring decentralization. The first, a $1.5M per plate ‘Crypto & AI Innovators Dinner' by MAGA Inc. on May 5th, featured Crypto Czar David Sacks as a guest. The second, a May 22nd gala for top $TRUMP meme coin holders, promises perks like a White House tour for the top 25 (from mostly pseudonymous wallets), sparking backlash. Warren highlighted the Trump-linked stablecoin USD1, co-founded by Eric Trump, which saw a $2B investment from Abu Dhabi's MGX Group, becoming the world's seventh-largest. She termed this as potential corruption, warning a Republican-backed stablecoin bill could ‘greenlight the grift.' Watchdog Accountable.US labeled the $TRUMP gala ‘nakedly corrupt,' concerned about anonymous foreign holders (potentially Tron's Justin Sun) and claiming Trump affiliates hold roughly 80% of the token supply. On May 5th, House Republicans Glenn Thompson and French Hill introduced a new Digital Asset Market Structure Discussion Draft. The bill wants to curb larger firm influence and promote broader market participation by, for example, defining an ‘affiliated person' as owning over 1% of the project's digital commodity (down from 5% in FIT21). Paradigm's Justin Slaughter sees this as fostering democratization. The draft also defines a ‘mature blockchain system' (not under common control) and exempts self-directed DeFi trading protocols from certain registrations. Ranking Member Maxine Waters reportedly plans to block a May 6th discussion event, citing committee rules. Regulation and clarity could help best altcoins like $SUBBD (which aims to decentralize the creator economy) and $BTCBULL (which is linked to the hard-hitting Bitcoin), benefit from the general increased market interest. By offering a fully-integrated user-centric platform powered by the $SUBBD token, the project addresses crippling platform fees, a lack of genuine ownership for creators and fans, the inefficiency of having to use multiple tools, and static fan subscriptions. Overall, $SUBBD will foster a fairer and more rewarding ecosystem for all. There are also many more benefits for $SUBBD holders. To access these, check out our step-by-step how-to-buy guide. SUBBD seems well aligned to upcoming policy changes, making it a well-placed altcoin to potentially see big gains in the future. Given the current excitement in the crypto market, where Bitcoin often takes centre stage (even being part of the US's Strategic Bitcoin Reserve), BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) offers an appealing way for investors to gain exposure to $BTC's momentum and earn passive income without buying $BTC itself. $BTCBULL holders, when using Best Wallet (a leading non-custodial crypto wallet), can receive $BTC airdrops when Bitcoin reaches significant price milestones of $150K and $200K. Token burns and additional $BTCBULL airdrops are also in store. With this bullish token having impressively raised over $5M of its $6M target, the time is now to get on board this bronco. Learn how to buy $BTCBULL in our guide and how far we think it'll go in our price prediction. That's the idea behind Chill Guy ($CHILLGUY), a meme coin that's all about being lowkey, calm, casual, and definitely not making a big deal out of things. It wants to spread the art of staying chill in what can be a pretty chaotic world. It's about making mindfulness accessible and something everyone can relate to, because life's all about being present and just taking one moment at a time. Being part of the Solana network, $CHILLGUY has seen an uptake in trading volume and market cap recently, which means people are starting to take notice. Maybe it's really time to relax a little and take some lessons from Chill Guy. You can purchase $CHILLGUY for $0.04977, and that price has seen a small bump of around 2.55% in the last day. With US political discussions and potential new crypto rules causing a buzz, the resulting hype could bring different kinds of projects like $SUBBD and $BTCBULL into focus, and netting holders potentially big returns. While these shifts could definitely open up some opportunities, it's good to remember that the crypto market is volatile and speculative, so do your own research before making any investment decisions.

We asked Vugar Usi Zadeh, COO of one of the world's largest crypto exchanges, Bitget, to talk about them and draw conclusions about how the situation will develop further. So, last week there were two big news items that somehow affected the market. These events certainly have the potential to significantly impact both Bitcoin's price and investor sentiment. Let's take a quick look at these news stories and see what potential impact they could have on the crypto industry. Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon all posted record revenue and profits in the first quarter of 2025, despite economic challenges and the start of a trade war initiated by the Trump administration. The results underscored robust demand for cloud computing, digital advertising and AI-powered solutions. Against this background, the dollar immediately strengthened, and a wave of volatility passed in the risk asset market, including cryptocurrencies. After all, strong employment data is another argument in favor of keeping rates high for a long period. Such news is often used as a trigger for price movement into a certain liquidity zone, but is not fundamental to the long-term trend in itself. Here are the main questions that will be answered: These topics are interconnected: trade barriers can increase inflation risks, and slowing inflation can create room for looser monetary policy. So even Powell's supposedly neutral comments could cause volatility, especially in the crypto market, which remains extremely sensitive to signals from the Fed. «News do not move the market by themselves. It is a tool for delivering liquidity,» explains one of the traders I know from dev.ua. Despite a possible BTC correction, there are still «live» sectors in the market.

This substantial increase in Solana's throughput will come to fruition through the Firedancer upgrade. Coming in and providing this extra validator not only diversifies the code base, which adds additional security, but obviously adds that crazy throughput with 400-millisecond finality. It's not just theory—they've had multiple demos where they are executing these volumes of transactions live.” Scaling to this speed would not be possible if Solana didn't already have robust architecture in place. In addition to speed and security gains, Solana is less expensive than the leading blockchain, Ethereum. “Their architecture, with this upgrade, supports real-time settlement in traditional payment rails,” Hugentobler said. A significant barrier that has kept many institutions from fully investing in digital assets is concerns about the security of financial data. To meet this need, Solana has introduced technologies like token extensions, which can protect private data on the blockchain. Token extensions enable developers to create tokens with unique features designed for specific use cases. Token extensions can also enable memo fields, which allow additional information to be included with payments. Confidential balances are built to enable private token transfers within institutional compliance. Some of the use cases for this added functionality are in payroll, B2B payments, and other scenarios where particular regulatory requirements come into play. Solana has also developed auditor keys, which give institutions more insight into transactions without overreaching on compliance. All these innovations mean Solana is poised to deliver on more of an institution's needs. “Solana with this upgrade has enabled token extensions which allow KYC, AML, compliance, transaction freezing, things like metadata tagging, confidential transfers, and real privacy transfers—all on a public blockchain,” Hugentobler said. These characteristics have made Solana a top choice for tokenizing real-world assets—which can be an intensive process. However, the use cases for Solana can go much further. “Solana is being used by big names like Visa, PayPal, and Franklin Templeton,” Hugentobler said. “They're using it for stablecoins, cross-border payments, tokenized funds, treasury settlement, that sort of thing. The Firedancer upgrade should make Solana an even more compelling choice for financial services companies, once it is live. “Frankendancer is the hybrid upgrade between Firedancer and what's existing, a smooth process that's fully live,” Hugentobler said. “It has consensus live voting and all that sort of thing on the back end. Firedancer is live, but it doesn't have the consensus model fully live, so the voting and things like that are not 100% quite yet, but they are saying it should go fully live this quarter.”</p>

Amid recent market underperformance, the project has faced criticisms from its community, competitors, and even institutions. Now, even as the project looks to address growing concerns and rally behind a clear vision, it has been hit with a potential institutional adoption blow. The firm disclosed this in a scathing statement released on Thursday. “ETH's statistical trading behavior, value proposition, and community culture have failed beyond a point that is worth engaging,” it said. According to Two Prime, “ETH has fundamentally changed” and is now trading “like a memecoin,” making it problematic for algorithmic trading and as collateral for lending. Meanwhile, the shared volatility data suggested that over a 30-day period, Ethereum traded more like Dogecoin than Bitcoin. “This makes institutional participation less attractive, suggesting declining trading volumes and market depth.” This low institutional interest is perhaps already evident in the flows to spot exchange-traded funds. Even with a higher market cap, BTC total supply consumed by ETFs is more than double that of the ETH supply,” Two Prime said, positing that the failure of Ethereum ETFs to catch a bid could translate to less resource allocation towards their promotion and sale. Get up to $400 in rewards for successfully completing short educational courses and making your first qualifying trade on Coinbase. Two Prime theorized that the cause of Ethereum's problems was threefold. For one, the firm said the project is no longer unique in its role of powering decentralized applications and is falling behind competing chains like Solana in technological capability and performance. Citing similar factors, Standard Chartered reduced its ETH price target for 2025 by a staggering 60% from $10,000 to $4,000 in March. Similarly, VanEck cut its 2030 ETH target by 67% from $22,000 to $7,300 in October.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A closely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin may have one last breakout rally before altcoins start to outperform BTC. BTC.D calculates how much of the crypto market cap belongs to BTC. A peaking Bitcoin dominance chart suggests that altcoins are close to outshining BTC. “Bitcoin dominance has one final leg left in its macro uptrend on the road to 71% (red). A successful retest would enable final trend continuation on the road to 71% (green box).” “This idea was first explored in mid-October 2024 and actually ended up playing out. It would be poetry if Bitcoin repeated history and followed through on the same path in this current range as well. Bitcoin is trading for $94,604 at time of writing, down 1.1% in the last 24 hours.

Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that more companies are settling employee salaries with crypto assets. “I see a lot of businesses that are starting to settle with their full-time employees and with their gig employees all over the world, in crypto.” According to Kozyakov, workers paid in crypto may ask what they can do next with their funds. You need to use it for everyday purchases,” Kozyakov told Cointelegraph. Kozyakov said that crypto earners are looking for ways to use their digital asset incomes in daily life scenarios, whether buying coffee, going out for drinks or settling utility bills.

The executive said that in practice, spending crypto can still be complex. Because of this, he highlighted a need for easier ways to spend crypto directly. The executive said that this is where their company comes in. On April 23, the payment services firm collaborated with the hardware wallet company Ledger on a crypto payment card that allows users to spend crypto where Mastercard payments are accepted. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that seamless crypto payment options will drive wider crypto adoption, not just as an investment, but as a true medium of exchange for daily life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following a call for interest published in October 2024, the ECB received over 100 applications from various market actors. Approximately 70 participants were selected to join one or both dedicated workstreams: pioneers and visionaries. These participants include banks, fintechs, merchants, startups, and other payment service providers. The initiative is designed to simulate the digital euro ecosystem, with the ECB offering technical infrastructure and support to enable European intermediaries to explore and test digital euro functionalities. The platform aims to assess how the digital euro could integrate into existing payment systems and generate added value for end-users. The “pioneers” workstream is primarily focused on investigating conditional or programmable payments – transactions that execute automatically when predefined criteria are fulfilled. These may include use cases such as releasing payment upon delivery confirmation for an online purchase. Participants in the pioneers group are integrating simulated digital euro interfaces with their systems, with technical guidance from the ECB. This includes access to APIs and relevant documentation. Each participant is independently developing use cases and will deliver a report summarising their findings. The “visionaries” workstream is conducting research into how the digital euro could address broader societal challenges, including digital financial inclusion. Concepts under consideration include enabling access to digital euro wallets through widespread physical channels such as post offices, which could extend services to unbanked populations or individuals lacking digital access.
