                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The communication app TeleMessage Signal, used by at least one top Trump administration official to archive messages, has already reportedly suffered breaches that illustrate concerning security flaws and resulted in its parent company imposing a service pause this week pending investigation. Now, according to detailed new findings from the journalist and security researcher Micah Lee, TM Signal's archiving feature appears to fundamentally undermine Signal's flagship security guarantees, sending messages between the app and a user's message archive without end-to-end encryption, thus making users' communications accessible to TeleMessage. Lee conducted a detailed analysis of TM Signal's Android source code to assess the app's design and security. In collaboration with 404 Media, he had previously reported on a hack of TM Signal over the weekend, which revealed some user messages and other data—a clear sign that at least some data was being sent unencrypted, or as plaintext, at least some of the time within the service. “The fact that there are plaintext logs confirms my hypothesis,” Lee tells WIRED. TeleMessage is a federal contractor, but the consumer apps it offers are not approved for use under the US government's Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, or FedRAMP. Smarsh did not return WIRED's requests for comment about Lee's findings. The company said on Monday, “TeleMessage is investigating a potential security incident. Lee's findings are likely significant for all TeleMessage users but have particular significance given that TM Signal was used by President Donald Trump's now-former national security adviser Mike Waltz. He was photographed last week using the service during a cabinet meeting, and the photo appeared to show that he was communicating with other high-ranking officials, including Vice President JD Vance, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and what appears to be US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Lee found that TM Signal is designed to save Signal communication data in a local database on a user's device and then send this to an archive server for long-term retention. In a letter on Tuesday, US senator Ron Wyden called for the Department of Justice to investigate TeleMessage, alleging that it is “a serious threat to US national security.” “They have given their users something that looks and feels like Signal, the most widely trusted secure communications app. Yuval Noah Harari: “Prepare to share the planet with AI superintelligence”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As an industry that makes movies and TV shows—in trade parlance: services, not products—Hollywood may have thought it was safe from President Donald Trump's tariffs. Specifically, a 100 percent tariff on movies coming to the US that were “produced in Foreign Lands.” Shares in Netflix, Disney, and other media properties started to slip, but the real uncertainty laid in a much different question: How the hell do you tariff movies? They don't come over on ships and get taxed at the port. Would the tariffs apply to foreign films acquired by US distributors? And while tariffs are unlikely to have the effect Trump claims he wants, a federal tax credit program for filmmakers—something California politicians spent years advocating for—could be a much stronger alternative. A lot of the confusion over Trump's proposed tariff is a result of the labyrinthine ways modern movies get made. For years Hollywood studios have filmed abroad in search of tax incentives offered in places like the UK, Canada, or Australia that essentially subsidize the cost of renting local facilities and hiring local crews in exchange for bringing business to those countries. Visual effects and other aspects of postproduction can get outsourced too. Bringing that work back to the US would be good for American filmmakers and their crews, but there's no clear indication a tariff would do that. More likely, studios would just make fewer films, or—as consumers have seen with tariffs on other goods—the price of hitting the cineplex would go up. In a Monday LinkedIn post, cinema analyst David Hancock wrote that it's “quite hard to see what the US government can actually tariff.” Frequently, films are digital files, and the rights to them are often split between creators, financiers, and other entities. “Either the US government has to ban US producers from working abroad, which would significantly reduce the number of movies being made and drastically weaken their film industry,” Hancock wrote, “or they have to create a federal tax credit scheme” to help US studios maintain their output without seeing their costs skyrocket. The tariff idea, it seems, at least partially came from actor Jon Voight, one of three Hollywood “ambassadors”—along with Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson—chosen by Trump to advise him. Voight reportedly met with the president recently at Mar-a-Lago along with his manager to share plans to increase US film production. Their plan included tax incentives, coproduction treaties with other countries, “tariffs in certain limited circumstances,” and other strategies, according to The New York Times. Following Trump's tariff post, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director of the Screen Actors Guild—American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), signaled he was open to the plan but wanted to know more specifics. Paul Erickson, a media and entertainment analyst with Omdia, says there are a lot of question marks around “just how disruptive and financially damaging” the tariffs could be to studios or what benefits there could be, if they were to go into effect. Following Trump's announcement Sunday, several Democratic leaders offered tax credits as an alternative. On Monday, California governor Gavin Newsom said in a statement that he wanted to work with the president on a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit. Dozens of states, like Georgia and California, offer such incentives, but no national program exists. In a statement released Monday, Schiff said he shared Trump's goal of bringing more filmmaking back to the US but added that “blanket tariffs on all films would have unintended and potentially damaging impacts.” Tax credits, he added, would be a way the US could reshore jobs. “But whose industry?” wrote Hollywood Reporter columnist Steven Zeitchik, noting that even Trump's “ambassadors” Gibson and Stallone make movies abroad. It's hard to tell how much the administration will want to work with studios, or give them credits, especially given its positions on studios' DEI efforts and funding the arts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thanks to a recent ruling that ordered Apple to stop charging a 27% commission on purchases through iPhone apps, Amazon's Kindle iOS app now has a “Get book” button that makes it easier to buy titles. “We regularly make improvements to our apps to help ensure we are providing customers the most convenient experience possible,” Amazon spokesperson Tim Gillman told The Verge, which first reported the news. “By selecting ‘Get Book' within the Kindle for iOS app, customers can now complete their purchase through their mobile web browser.” Prior to this change, buying titles through the Kindle or Amazon app, or even viewing their prices, wasn't allowed. Amazon isn't the only tech giant that's taking advantage of the recent ruling, as Spotify started allowing users to access pricing information and external payment links last Friday.

The official release notes for Nvidia's CUDA 12.9 Toolkit explicitly indicate that the next major release will no longer support Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta-based GPUs. Note that this deprecation is only limited to the compute side, as these GPUs will likely continue receiving normal GeForce drivers for the time being. That being said, this is likely the last SDK version that can be used to develop CUDA applications targeting the aforementioned architectures. While the previous release hinted at this change, Nvidia's stronger wording now serves as a definitive signal for developers to shift to more modern architectures. CUDA 12.x series (and before) will still allow application development for these GPUs. Essentially, future CUDA compilers (nvcc) will lack the ability to generate machine code compatible with these GPUs. In the same vein, upcoming versions of CUDA-accelerated libraries like cuBLAS, cuDNN, etc., will not offer support for GPUs built using these architectures. Nvidia has not specified an exact date for the upcoming major release (likely CUDA 13.x). Volta's consumer equivalent Turing (RTX 20) is next in line, but it likely has a lot more to offer before it too hits the chopping block. "Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta architectures are now feature-complete with no further enhancements planned. While CUDA Toolkit 12.x series will continue to support building applications for these architectures, offline compilation and library support will be removed in the next major CUDA Toolkit version release. Maxwell even found its way into the original Nintendo Switch's Tegra SoC. Volta would serve as the stepping stone for Nvidia's strides into the AI acceleration market, followed by Turing, Ampere, Hopper, and now Blackwell, which have since grown its valuation to nearly $2.8 trillion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I have not seen either new Windows 11 machines in person, so I have no idea how they feel in the hand. I also can't say whether or not the lower resolution screen on the Surface Laptop is visibly worse than last year's model. Even so, I'm certain of one thing: People will be mad that Microsoft removed the magnetic Surface Connect port from both PCs. “What you'll notice is [the 12-inch Surface Pro] comes with USB-C charging only,” Hirani told Gizmodo. Because if you look in your bag today, I'm pretty sure there are multiple devices in there that are charged with USB-C.” Hirani suggests that removing the Surface Connect port is consumer-friendly because you'll have one less proprietary charger to stow in your bag. It wasn't like you were forced to use one or the other—you had choice. Just like Apple's MagSafe chargers for its MacBooks, should you or anyone else ever trip over the Surface Connect cable, your Surface wouldn't be at risk of faceplanting into the floor. It's saved my old Surface Pro 7 from certain display damage more times than I can remember. I also wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft has survey data showing that Surface owners aren't using their Surface Connect ports to charge their devices as much as they're using USB-C, and perhaps there aren't many Surface Dock owners in the real world. No point in including the magnetic dock (another added cost to the BOM, aka build of materials) if reported usage is low. When I grilled for a more satisfying answer, Hirani suggested that thinness and lightness were greater priorities to make the new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop more modern and portable. I mean no disrespect, but I thought after Jony Ive left Apple, the pursuit of ever-skinnier computers with unnecessary tradeoffs (like removing useful ports) was over. It seems designers can't quit thinner and lighter devices yet. At 0.30 inches (7.8mm) thick and weighing 1.5 pounds (686g), the 12-inch Surface Pro makes the previous, larger 13-inch Surface Pro (11th-gen) seem downright bulky, even though it's 9.3mm thick and weighs 895g. It's not like I can't appreciate thinner Surfaces. I've reviewed enough gadgets, seen enough teardowns, and toured enough R&D labs at various tech companies (including Microsoft's Surface design studio) to know that modern laptops and tablets are packed extremely densely. Every millimeter of a Surface is filled as much as possible with electronics, and when both the footprint and profile are reduced, there's even less room to house certain components—like the Surface Connect port—despite appearing to fit. If you're hoping that Microsoft might only be testing the waters now that former Surface chief Panos Panay abandoned ship for Amazon, I have some bad news for you. While Hirani didn't outright confirm they've buried the Surface Connect port in the graveyard, there's a good chance that future Surface refreshes to machines like the Surface Laptop Studios or more budget Surface Go tablets will ditch the magnetic port.

These new Copilot+ PCs will be available starting May 20, while business versions will ship on July 22.Both systems share similar specs, including 16GB of RAM and up to 512GB of SSD storage, though the Pro has a faster, higher-resolution display than the Laptop and also comes with Windows Hello support in the webcam, which the laptop relegates to a fingerprint reader. The Surface Pro 11th Edition and Surface Laptop 7th Edition, which debuted last year with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus (10 Core) processors, each starting at $799.99 as of this writing. Unless the prices for those more powerful models go up, potential buyers may want to consider one of those more powerful systems if they don't care about having the thinnest, lightest designs. It's possible that these Snapdragon X Plus (8 Core) models are priced higher due to tariffs, but Microsoft hasn't commented.Update: May 6, 10:04 a.m. This tablet is 1.5 pounds before adding the optional 0.27-pound keyboard. The $129 Surface Slim pen is also sold separately. Microsoft says that the new keyboard lies flat "for a grounded and quiet typing experience," and that it folds back flat against the Surface Pro for when you want to write or draw. The new Pro will come in three colors: the default platinum seen on so many Surface devices, a bold new violet, and a dark, blue-green color called "ocean." Perhaps the other biggest physical distinction is that this system won't have Microsoft's proprietary Surface Connect port, instead relying entirely on USB Type-C for charging. The system will come with a USB Type-C cable for charging, but it won't include a wall charger in the box. It's possible this is a result of European Union rulings requiring USB-C charging on tablets, meaning that a charger isn't strictly required, like with phones. You'll need at least a 45W charger in order to fast charge the new Surface Pro. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The Surface Pro has two cameras: a 1080p webcam with support for Windows Hello facial recognition, and a 10MP rear shooter for people who like to take pictures with tablets. For $899, you bump up to 512GB of storage and can also get the violent or ocean color options. The new Surface Laptop, which Microsoft claims is the thinnest and lightest Surface Laptop to date, is a more straightforward update. It's smaller than the existing Surface Laptop, which comes in 13.8-inch and 15-inch screen sizes. Microsoft claims that the Surface Laptop and its Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus (8 core) processor is "50% faster than Surface Laptop 5 and even outpaces the MacBook Air M3." While that might be what some users are upgrading from, the Surface Laptop 5 launched in 2022 with 12th Gen Intel processors, while the MacBook Air is now on its next iteration with the M4 chip. Unlike the Surface Pro, Microsoft is using a fan here for improved sustained performance. The $999 configuration that jumps to 512GB of storage also comes in violet or ocean. Alongside the new Surfaces, Microsoft is announcing a series of new Copilot+ features that will show up in Windows Insider builds over the next month.These include an update to settings to let you use natural language to search for and change settings on your PC. There will also be a new AI-based Snipping Tool to perfectly crop screenshots, a sticker generator in Paint for chats or documents, and more updates to Narrator for better image descriptions. This will debut on Snapdragon X Series PCs and come to AMD and Intel later on.Additionally, there will be a redesigned Start Menu that adds a sidebar showing recent activity from your phone, as well as AI actions in File Explorer.Microsoft is continuing to push the Copilot+ as the future of the PC, especially with support for Windows 10 ending on Oct. 14, 2025. The company has been slowly expanding Copilot+ features that run on the NPU, including launching Recall to find what you previously looked for and an improved Windows Search. AI PCs haven't been a huge boon for upgrades, and despite being called Copilot+, Microsoft's Copilot chatbot doesn't actually run on device. But the clock running out on Windows 10 may drive more sales as potential buyers look for the latest updates, features, and security patches. Andrew E.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on Wired are independently selected by our editors. Instead, they're slightly more affordable and exist as new options within the Surface lineup. On paper, they sound great, but choosing a Surface laptop is now more complex. A lower price means some compromises—the new laptops are equipped with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Plus chip, with no option to upgrade to the more powerful Snapdragon X Elite. The screens are smaller, with lower screen resolutions and refresh rates. Microsoft did away with the Surface Connect Port, but the USB-C port supports fast charging (with a 60-watt charger or higher). Inside is the Snapdragon X Plus processor, which was unveiled alongside the Surface Laptop (7th Edition) and Surface Pro (11th Edition). However, this chipset has fewer cores in the newer laptop—eight versus 10—so there is a small performance hit. Microsoft says it's up to 50 percent faster than the Surface Laptop 5, which the company anticipates most Surface buyers will be upgrading from. That's a little more than the claimed 20 hours of video playback and 13 hours of web browsing on the Surface Laptop (7th Edition). It accomplishes this feat despite being thinner and lighter, weighing 2.7 pounds, around 118 grams less. It starts at $899 and is available for preorder, with official sales beginning May 20. You can buy the Surface Laptop (7th Edition)—with 16 GB of RAM, 256 GB of storage, and a 10-core Snapdragon X Plus chip, for less money right now at retailers like Best Buy and Amazon. The new Surface Pro (12 Inch) is not a follow-up to last year's Surface Pro 11th Edition, but a slightly cheaper alternative. On the front is a 1080p camera with Windows Hello sign-in authentication support, and on the back is a 10-megapixel camera. There's no option to add 5G connectivity, but it supports the latest Wi-Fi 7 standard. Like the new Surface Laptop, it's powered by the Snapdragon X Plus (8-core) processor, which helps deliver what Microsoft claims is up to 16 hours of battery life for local video playback and 12 hours of web browsing. It has 16 gigabytes of RAM and the same storage options. It also has two USB-C ports and a 3.5-mm headphone jack. The Surface Pro keyboard has been redesigned specifically for this model. Microsoft says it now rests and folds back completely flat against the tablet, making it easier to type, draw, or write. The Surface Pro (12 Inch) is available for preorder and starts at $799, with retail sales kicking off on May 20. Presumably, the new Surface Laptop and Surface Pro will see discounts during major sale events that will separate them from their flagship siblings and make them a better value. That includes Windows Studio Effects, which offers creative filters; Eye Contact, which adjusts your eyes so they appear to look at the camera even if you're looking off to the side; Portrait Blur, for a blurred background during video calls; and Voice Focus, to enhance audio and reduce background noise. There's also CoCreator, a generative AI feature built into Paint that generates an image based on your drawing and the prompt you type in, plus Live Captions for instant real-time translation across video and audio calls. They're also privy to the recently launched Recall feature in Windows 11. The feature captures your activity as a screenshot every few seconds. That way, it can pull up anything you've seen or done on your PC with a simple search query. Microsoft has a few new AI features too. A new agent tool in Settings lets you describe an issue you're having with your PC and receive recommendations on how to address it. A Photos Relight feature in the Photos app lets you access lighting controls and built-in presets to edit your images. You'll also find a Snipping Tool for screenshots (that allows you to tightly frame the exact thing you want to screenshot), along with a new Paint Sticker generator (to create custom stickers from a text prompt) and Paint Object Select (where you can pinpoint certain elements on the canvas and make edits)—both of which are rolling out to the Windows Insider Program first.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Uncle Sam wants to see where its AI chips are going. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Congressman and physicist Bill Foster plans to introduce a bill that will require advanced AI chipmakers like Nvidia to include a built-in location reporting system. According to Reuters, this system will use existing and readily available technology to find the general country-level location of an AI chip. In fact, two sources say that Alphabet is using something similar to track the location of its in-house Tensor AI chips across all its data centers to protect against theft and other security breaches. It has been doing this to limit its rival's access to cutting-edge technology and help ensure the U.S.'s dominance in AI technology. However, the bans and sanctions have been criticized for being ineffective, with the former U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo calling them “a fool's errand”. Rep. Foster's proposal aims to solve this issue by requiring AI chips to communicate with a secure computer server whenever they go online. Reuters claims that independent technical experts say that the proposal by the congressman, who is a former particle physicist and has a doctorate in physics from Harvard University, is feasible and could potentially work. However, the Congressman from Illinois wants to go beyond that. This would be significantly more technically challenging than just finding a chip's location, but the representative says that “we can have more detailed discussions with the actual chip and module providers” to know how to implement it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gerlach estimates the wholesale cost of apple juice concentrate has risen 33 percent this year compared to 2024—and he expects it to keep going up. But the biggest impact so far has been on Chinese imports, which now face a new 145 percent tariff. The measure has driven up consumer prices and disrupted the supply chains for products ranging from baby gear to Christmas decorations to sex toys. While produce represents a relatively small portion of China's exports to the US overall, there are certain types of food and drink heavily sourced from the country, like garlic, seafood, and, yes, apple juice. For many years, China was the main place where the US sourced its apple juice, but Turkey has recently emerged as a close competitor. Data from the USDA suggest that Trump's tariffs have sparked a more dramatic shift in the US toward buying apple juice concentrate from Turkey. So far this year, Americans have imported around 92 million liters of unfrozen apple juice concentrate from China, compared to 29 million liters from Turkey. China saw a major spike in juice buying in January as importers raced to make purchases before the tariffs went into effect; now its sales have plummeted, while Turkey's are soaring. For the week of April 25, Turkey exported more than twice as much apple juice concentrate to the US as did mainland China. Some juice sellers may be able to stave off financial crisis by pivoting to buying more of their supply from Turkey and other countries, but Gerlach warns that the strategy isn't foolproof. Turkey already has plenty of other major international buyers, like India, and may not have enough apple juice to make up for China. Even if it does, US importers will have to compete to buy Turkey's juice, which means securing good deals for the sweet golden liquid will be tough. Importing agreements are often made months in advance, and some juice buyers may be contractually obligated to pay for existing orders from China, forcing them to find a way to contend with the added costs of the tariffs. For sellers who do have more flexibility, simply switching to made-in-America juice isn't a viable option, either. Adam Lees, vice president of customs brokerage for the logistics company Alba Wheels Up International, agrees that domestic players aren't equipped to meet exponentially increased demand, especially in the short term. “Factories don't just pop up in months,” he says. Some domestic apple processors are contemplating ramping up production, Gerlach says, motivated by the opportunity to sell their juice at higher-than-normal prices. Thus far, most large apple juice brands are staying quiet on whether they'll pass the added cost of tariffs on to their customers. Motts and Lassonde, which sells brands like Del Monte and Oasis, both declined to answer questions from WIRED about how they are responding to the Trump administration's trade policies. In the past week, President Trump has repeatedly insisted that American children should simply learn to live with fewer toys if tariffs make them more expensive. As the cost of apple juice and apple-juice-based products goes up as well, US families may be forced to make sacrifices in other areas, like cutting back on their favorite foods and drinks.

Intel once set the standard with x86, PCIe, and USB and now the vast majority of devices use these technologies in one way or another. However, containing AI hardware in the U.S. will provoke rapid development of competing AI ecosystems that can eventually outperform the one developed in America. Given the ubiquity of CUDA, such deployments are easy and relatively inexpensive. Nonetheless, Nvidia has domestic rivals, including traditional competitors like AMD and Intel as well as newcomers like D-Matrix and Tenstorrent. Most of their efforts are aimed at inference though, as Nvidia is the de facto king of AI training thanks to CUDA. The vast majority of China's high-tech giants — Alibaba, ByteDance, Tencent, just to name a few — use Nvidia hardware and virtually all European companies use Nvidia hardware. Meanwhile, when it comes to China, Nvidia has major rivals both on the hardware and platform sides. On the hardware front, Nvidia has competitors like Biren Technology, InnoSilicon, and Moore Threads. These companies are quite formidable competitors, even though for now their market share is negligible. All three companies use PowerVR GPU IP developed by the U.K.-based Imagination Technologies and have loads of experience with GPU development, according to Jon Peddie, the head of Jon Peddie Research. The founder of Moore Threads, Zhang Jianzhong (also known as Zhang Jian Zhong), previously worked at Nvidia: he was the general manager of Nvidia's operations in China. Co-CEO of Biren Technology is Allen Lee (also known as Li Xinrong), who used to be vice president and general manager of AMD's China R&D Center. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. "Li Bing's background and expertise in the tech industry likely influenced his vision for Biren Technology, which focuses on developing high-performance GPUs for various applications," Peddie told Tom's Hardware. But while Biren, InnoSilicon, and Moore Threads have rather good hardware, for now they lack an ecosystem that is comparable to Nvidia's CUDA. However, there is a company in China that can compete with Nvidia not only on the hardware side of matters, but also on the platform level: Huawei. Huawei has its Cloud Matrix 384 system, which it claims can outperform Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 rack-scale machine for AI. Perhaps more importantly, the company has its own AI-oriented, heterogeneous Compute Architecture for Neural Networks (CANN) platform designed specifically to use the potential of Huawei's HiSilicon Ascend AI processors. Just like Nvidia's CUDA, Huawei's CANN offers a complete suite of development resources such as runtime systems, model-building tools, and compilers. It works with both Huawei's MindSpore platform and widely-used AI libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch, making it flexible for developers. The framework includes a broad range of tuned computational components to speed up model execution and is also compatible with ONNX Runtime, allowing it to run ONNX-based models efficiently on the company's Ascend accelerators for AI. Although CANN is a key part of Huawei's AI infrastructure, it has drawn criticism for being difficult to work with, mainly due to unstable performance, inadequate documentation, and reliability issues that complicate model training and deployment. However, if Nvidia's GPUs will be unavailable for Chinese and European buyers, they will at least consider Huawei, or perhaps Biren, Innosilicon, or Moore Threads hardware. This will not only decrease Nvidia's revenues by tens of billions every year and its market capitalization by hundreds of billions, but could also eventually make its competitors from China as trend setters in the AI segment, the company believes. "Regardless of how one feels about DeepSeek's open-source R1 model, it is a clear indication that innovation is moving rapidly around the world, with or without leading U.S. tech," the statement by Nvidia reads. Under the Biden administration's AI Diffusion framework, unrestricted access to high-end AI chips like Nvidia's H100 is reserved for companies in the U.S. and a select group of 18 allied countries classified as 'Tier 1.' Companies in 'Tier 2' nations are subject to an annual limit of approximately 50,000 H100-class GPUs, unless they secure verified end user (VEU) approval. They can still import up to 1,700 units per year without a license, and these do not count toward the national quota. However, countries listed as 'Tier 3' — including China, Russia, and Macau — are essentially blocked from receiving such hardware due to arms embargo restrictions. The Trump administration is now reviewing this tier system to make it more straightforward and enforceable, and is rumored to make limitations for Tier 2 nations even stricter. Not only will Nvidia cease to be able to sell its GPUs to China, which is one of its largest markets, but its Chinese customers will be forced to either use its GPUs in the cloud, or switch to processors developed in China, such as those designed by Huawei or one of the aforementioned companies. While this will slow down development of China's AI sector in the short term, it will give a strong boost for its AI hardware ecosystem in the mid and long-term future. Once Huawei and others increase sales of their AI hardware, they will be able to invest more in development of their AI ecosystems, which will get more competitive against those developed by Nvidia and other American companies (such as AMD and Intel) than they are today. What's more important, they will be able to set standards of the AI market and that will not only reduce Nvidia's influence on such standards, but it will greatly reduce American influence on AI development. The U.S. has already seen the consequences of ceding technological leadership, when Huawei gained a dominant foothold in global 5G deployments by offering cheaper and faster-to-deploy infrastructure. This serves as a cautionary example of how losing control over foundational standards can shift both market power and geopolitical influence. Nevertheless, whether the current administration has learnt from similar past mistakes remains to be seen. Anton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom's Hardware.
