Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Trump's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to reinstate his ban on trans military service, after a lower court blocked it. Editor's note, May 6: The Supreme Court issued a brief order temporarily blocking a lower court's decision, which had prevented President Donald Trump's ban on trans military service from taking effect. All three of the Court's Democrats, Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, dissented. Almost immediately after he began his second term, President Donald Trump ordered the military to ban transgender people from serving in the US military. Under the Defense Department's policy implementing this order, the military was supposed to start firing trans service members on March 26, although those firings were halted by a court order. The Trump administration's primary argument — that it's not banning trans military personnel, but merely banning service by people with gender dysphoria — is nonsensical, and the Court has repeatedly rejected similar arguments in the past. According to the American Psychiatric Association, gender dysphoria refers to the “psychological distress that results from an incongruence between one's sex assigned at birth and one's gender identity” that is commonly experienced by transgender people. The government may no more recharacterize a ban on trans service as a ban on gender dysphoria than it could defend Jim Crow by recharacterizing it as a series of laws targeting people with high levels of melanin. It is well-established that the government cannot evade a ban on discrimination by claiming that it is merely discriminating based on a trait that closely correlates with a particular identity. As the Supreme Court said in Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic (1993), “a tax on wearing yarmulkes is a tax on Jews.” As Judge Benjamin Settle, the district judge who blocked Trump's second-term ban, explained in his opinion, this ban is likely to do considerable harm to the United States. In Goldman v. Weinberger (1986), for example, the Court held that the military could ban Jewish service members from wearing yarmulkes while in uniform. As the Court explained, its “review of military regulations challenged on First Amendment grounds is far more deferential than constitutional review of similar laws or regulations designed for civilian society.” The military, Goldman reasoned, “must foster instinctive obedience, unity, commitment, and esprit de corps,” and that justifies imposing restrictions on service members that would normally violate the Constitution. The Court has even held that the military may engage in explicit sex discrimination — a fact that is highly relevant to the Shilling case because the Court held in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020) that discrimination against transgender workers is a form of illegal sex discrimination. While this kind of explicit sex discrimination would be unconstitutional in virtually any other context, Rostker explained that the courts owe extraordinary deference to Congress in matters of “national defense and military affairs.” Given these precedents, the plaintiffs challenging Trump's transgender service ban always faced an uphill climb. And that's doubly true because the Court's current majority has not been particularly sympathetic to constitutional claims brought by trans litigants. As Judge Benjamin Settle, the district judge who blocked Trump's second-term ban, explained in his opinion, this ban is likely to do considerable harm to the United States. The named plaintiff in the Shilling case is Commander Emily Shilling, a pilot with 19 years of military service who has flown 60 combat missions. All of that expertise will now be lost to the US military. And the Supreme Court's precedents permit the military to discriminate in ways that other institutions cannot, which is bad news for people targeted by Trump's transgender service ban. Trump filled the Supreme Court bench with anti-government saboteurs. Trump's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to reinstate his ban on trans military service, after a lower court blocked it. Many of the justices seemed eager to impose impossible burdens on schools.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“The Houthis have announced to us at least that they don't want to fight anymore,” he said in the Oval Office on Tuesday during his meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. “They don't want to fight, and we will honor that. And we will stop the bombings, and they have capitulated, but more importantly, we will take their word. Despite the intense bombing campaign, the Houthis had, until now, not been deterred from carrying out attacks against vessels transiting the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, which are off Yemen's southern and western coasts. This sustained, aggressive series of operations is designed to restore freedom of navigation and American deterrence,” a Defense Department official told the Washington Examiner last week. “The U.S. has hit targets in Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen, destroying command-and-control facilities, weapons manufacturing facilities, and advanced weapons storage locations. We have confirmed the death of several Houthi leaders.” The attacks on commercial vessels forced shipping companies to avoid the Red Sea, which meant their ships had to travel much longer and more expensive routes to avoid getting targeted. They have killed multiple sailors, seized a ship, and sunk two others that posed environmental concerns. A Houthi-launched missile hit Israel's Ben Gurion Airport on Sunday, which highlighted the imperfect nature of Israel's air defense systems. Israel Defense Forces struck what it described as “terrorist infrastructure” at the Sana'a airport earlier on Tuesday, saying it was “fully disabled.” The IDF said 20 fighter jets dropped 50 munitions on various targets.</p>

Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney told President Donald Trump that Canada wouldn't ever be available for purchase. Despite President Donald Trump's interest in Canada becoming the 51st state, Canada isn't for sale — ever, according to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Trump regularly has said he wants Canada to become a U.S. state, and has discussed acquiring Greenland and the Panama Canal for security purposes. However, the matter of Canada isn't open to negotiation, Carney said. "Won't be for sale ever, but the opportunity is in the partnership and what we can build together. We have done that in the past, and part of that, as the president just said, is with respect to our security and my government is committed for a step change in our investment in Canadian security and our partnership." President Donald Trump meets Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office of the White House, May 6, 2025. While Trump acknowledged that Canada was stepping up its investment in military security, Trump said "never say never" in response to Canada becoming another state. "I've had many, many things that were not doable, and they ended up being doable," Trump said. Later, Carney said Canada's stance on the issue wouldn't alter. President Donald Trump greets Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House, May 6, 2025. "We're taking care of their military," Trump told the magazine. "We're taking care of every aspect of their lives, and we don't need them to make cars for us. In fact, we don't want them to make cars for us. We want to make our own cars. We don't need anything from Canada. And I say the only way this thing really works is for Canada to become a state." Still, Trump will continue pushing for Canada to become a state, though he cast doubt on whether he'd use military force to achieve such ends, he told NBC's Kristen Welker in an interview that aired Sunday. In the same interview, Trump doubled down on how significant Greenland is for the U.S. in terms of national security. Although Greenland has asserted it is seeking independence from Denmark and isn't interested in joining the U.S., Trump has regularly expressed a strong interest in securing Greenland — particularly given an increase in Russian and Chinese presence in the Arctic. "Something could happen with Greenland," Trump told NBC. "I'll be honest, we need that for national and international security."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Related live-story Trump meets with Canadian Prime Minister Carney amid trade tensions The assessment, which was circulated in the US government in early April, has become a flashpoint in President Donald Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which gives a president broad power to target and remove undocumented immigrants in times of war or when an enemy attempts an “invasion or predatory incursion.” A Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas on Friday ruled that the president had unlawfully invoked the law, finding that the president “cannot summarily declare that a foreign nation or government has threatened or perpetrated an invasion or predatory incursion of the United States,” and blocking the administration from quickly deporting some alleged members of the Venezuelan gang. The intelligence assessment acknowledged that the Maduro regime likely “sometimes tolerates” Tren de Aragua's presence within its borders, with some individual government officials cooperating with the group for financial gain. And FBI analysts assessed that some number of Venezuelan government officials “facilitate” TdA members' migration to the United States and use “members as proxies” there and in other countries “to advance what they see as the Maduro regime's goal of destabilizing governments and undermining public safety in those countries,” the assessment said. But the broader intelligence community views it as “highly unlikely” that there is any “strategic or consistent” cooperation between the Maduro government and Tren de Aragua. Intelligence analysts also expressed skepticism about some of the law enforcement reporting that some members of the regime may have provided financial support to TdA, because it cannot verify the sources' access — and because some of the claims have come from people detained in the United States, which “could motivate them to make false allegations about their ties to the regime … to lessen any punishment by providing exculpatory of otherwise ‘valuable' information to US prosecutors,” the report read. Further, the assessment read, “the small size of TDA's cells, its focus on low-skill criminal activities, and its decentralized structure make it highly unlikely that TDA coordinates large volumes of human trafficking or migrant smuggling.” “Illegal immigrant criminals have raped, tortured, and murdered Americans, and still, the propaganda media continues to operate as apologists for them,” Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said in a statement on Monday, when asked about the April assessment. “It is outrageous that as President Trump and his administration work hard every day to make America safe by deporting these violent criminals, some in the media remain intent on twisting and manipulating intelligence assessments to undermine the President's agenda to keep the American people safe.”</p>

Former acting DHS deputy secretary Ken Cuccinelli weighs in on President Donald Trump being blocked from revoking migrants' legal status on 'The Will Cain Show.' The individual, previously referred to only as "Cristian" in earlier documents, was identified Monday as Daniel Lozano-Camargo, a 20-year-old Venezuelan man who had been living in Houston prior to January, when he was arrested for cocaine possession and subsequently deported to El Salvador in March. News of his identity was first reported by Politico. U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher ruled late last month that the Trump administration violated a settlement agreement that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) struck last year with a group of young asylum seekers, including Lozano-Camargo, by deporting him before his asylum request was heard in full. More than 250 suspected gang members deported by the U.S. – including members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua and MS-13 – arrive in El Salvador under heavy security on March 16, 2025. In her April ruling, Gallagher emphasized that unlike other legal challenges to Trump-era deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, this case hinges on an alleged "breach of contract," as DHS had agreed not to deport the individuals until their asylum claims were fully adjudicated in U.S. court. Lozano-Camargo's December 2022 asylum request was still pending when he was deported along with hundreds of other migrants on March 15 to El Salvador. She also alluded to the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the alleged MS-13 member living in Maryland who was also deported to El Salvador last month in what administration officials have acknowledged was an administrative error. The Trump administration previously told the court it had determined that Lozano-Camargo was eligible for removal under the Alien Enemies Act because he had been arrested and convicted for cocaine possession earlier this year. This appears to be his second low-level drug offense. A suspected gang member arrives in El Salvador, where he will be transported to the country's maximum security prison. Trump officials doubled down on this in a Monday court filing, telling the court there was no breach of contract with DHS in Lozano-Camargo's case, They told the court that his designation as an "alien enemy pursuant to the AEA results in him ceasing to be a member" of the class that had negotiated a settlement – "aliens subject to removal" under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act proclamation "cannot claim asylum, and therefore are not class members." To date, there is no public evidence that Lozano-Camargo is a member of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which Trump declared on March 15 to be a designated "Foreign Terrorist Organization" in an effort to allow them to more quickly deport certain migrants from the U.S. Justice Department officials claimed in earlier court documents that Lozano-Camargo was a member of a "violent terrorist gang," but have not linked him to TdA. Portions of their most recent court filing have been redacted.

Fox News Digital spoke to SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler about the outlook for small businesses during the next four years "What I see on the ground is American manufacturers, small businesses alike are grateful to President Trump for his fair trade policy, for having the strength and the backbone to stand up to adversaries and allies alike and demand that they stop treating Americans unfairly with these trade practices," Loeffler told Fox News Digital about the current state of the economy as President Donald Trump faces criticism from Democrats and media outlets for his tariff policies. "I see really strong support and optimism as well for the future. So, while there is a period of change here as we get through these negotiations and with trading partners at the table, we will make sure that small businesses have a big seat at that table, and we are already seeing small businesses invest for the future because they see the opportunity for a made-in-America approach that will really transform the strength of this country not just economically but from a national security perspective." Loeffler, speaking to Fox News Digital at an event in Washington, D.C., kicking off "Small Business Week," said the current media narrative on Trump's trade policies is "completely counter" to what she sees when she travels the country. Monday marked the start of "Small Business Week." "They are fully behind President Trump's policies to lower our taxes, to have fair trade, President Trump has already brought down core inflation to four-year lows," Loeffler said. "We've seen the jobs come back, almost a half million jobs created in President Trump's first hundred days, and we're seeing his regulatory reforms have rollbacks that have already made a huge difference saving small businesses hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions already. Loeffler pointed out that small businesses make up 99% of all businesses in the country and create two out of three of every new job, and touted that the SBA has seen an 80% increase in loans in Trump's first 100 days in office. "Small businesses don't take out loans unless they have confidence that they're going to grow, and we've seen that small businesses are doing just that," Loeffler said. President Donald Trump speaks at the White House on Tuesday, April 22. Loeffler told Fox News Digital that during her tenure, the SBA has been "refocused" on its mission after four years of the Biden administration, and part of that mission has been to implement Trump's agenda on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and illegal immigration. The SBA recently eliminated its Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility, while placing the office's employees on administrative leave, and paused grants across the agency that it believes interferes with Trump's executive orders combating DEI. In March, Fox News Digital exclusively reported that the SBA enacted a series of reforms on Thursday aimed at ensuring illegal immigrants do not receive taxpayer benefits while also removing its offices from sanctuary cities. "We're moving out of sanctuary cities to keep not only our employees safe, but the small businesses that wanna come in and access our programs," Loeffler told Fox News Digital. "We also need to relocate them to areas where small businesses are actually booming and that's not necessarily true in sanctuary cities." Loeffler told Fox News Digital that she is particularly excited about what she sees in the manufacturing sector and what can be accomplished in that area if Trump is able to get his tax cut plan through Congress. "Manufacturing loans are up 74% and so that Made in America engine is happening to the tune of about a hundred manufacturing loans per week and that's what President Trump's agenda has done," Loeffler said. I've talked to many of those CEOs. So I'm tremendously excited about the upside that we can see with regard to the tax policy being passed. Hopefully, we have permanent tax cuts that we can deliver to small businesses soon, because I know that the demand for investment by small businesses is there, and it's really spring-loaded once that tax bill passes."

The White House removed Alvin Brown from the National Transportation Safety Board, a White House official confirmed to Fox News Digital Tuesday morning. Brown had served on the five-person safety panel since March 2024, before President Joe Biden appointed him as vice chair of the board in December 2024 – one month before President Donald Trump's inauguration. The National Transportation Safety Board is an independent government agency charged with investigating major transportation accidents, such as plane crashes, and crafting safety guidance to prevent accidents. Brown, a Democrat, was the first Black mayor of Jacksonville, Florida, serving from 2011 to 2015, before serving as senior advisor for Community Infrastructure Opportunities for the U.S. Department of Transportation in 2022, according to his biography. Alvin Brown, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, attends an investigative hearing. Brown was removed from his role in May 2025. The National Transportation Safety Board's website, as of Tuesday morning, lists four members, all of whom were appointed by Trump either during his first or second administration. They are Chair ​​​​​​​​​​​​Jennifer L. Homendy, ​​​Michael Graham, ​​Thomas B. Chapman and ​​​J. The Trump administration was rocked by a plane crash on Jan. 29 near the nation's capital, when 67 people were killed after an Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines passenger plane collided near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. That accident was followed by other high-profile plane crashes. President Donald Trump's administration removed the Biden-era National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chair Alvin Brown. Air travel was hit with delays in recent days, most notably at New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport, when air traffic controllers briefly lost communication with planes. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy joined Fox News' Laura Ingraham Monday evening, where he addressed the delays and said he plans to overhaul and "radically transform" America's air traffic control system. We're bringing on new air traffic controllers," he said. "This has been a problem in the decades coming, and we're going to fix it." "When you have an incident like this, you want to make sure that people are safe," he added, referring to the delays in Newark. "And so, you just have less departures out of the airport until we feel comfortable and safe that the system isn't going to go down again."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of America's closest allies recently raised eyebrows for threatening to fire off the ultimate financial weapon against Washington in trade talks: dumping US debt. “It does exist as a card, but I think whether we choose to use it or not would be a separate decision,” Kato said. Related article The clock is ticking down to zero, and Trump needs a trade deal — badly Japan was unlikely to fire this big bazooka in the trade war anyway, since selling US Treasuries is considered an extreme move — one that would likely backfire, experts say. Still, the short-lived threat raises an ugly truth: The United States relies on other countries buying its $36 trillion mountain of debt. Even if a large-scale Treasury selloff is unlikely, other nations — including one of America's closest allies — are clearly considering all options. As America's biggest foreign creditor, Japan sits on $1.1 trillion of US Treasuries. That gives Tokyo some leverage as it seeks to hammer out a trade deal with the White House. Treasury rates would in turn sharply increase, making it more expensive for Washington to borrow and freaking out investors along the way. “It would send shockwaves around world financial markets if one of the most reliable buyers of Treasuries is no longer reliably in the market for it,” said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale and a chief economist in the Biden administration. Recall that fears of a bond market catastrophe helped convince Trump to pause so-called “reciprocal tariffs” on April 9. And Washington doesn't just rely on Japan to buy its debt. The United Kingdom, which faces a 10% tariff, is America's third-largest foreign creditor, with $750 billion of US Treasuries. But for these nations, dumping US debt, especially in a fire sale, would risk destabilizing global markets as well as their own. “Threatening to dump an asset of which it is a major holder means that Japan can hurt itself in the process,” Win Thin, global head of market strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. He wrote that this kind of threat is “always a double-edged sword.” Maury Obstfeld, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNN that Japan's comments seem “very rash” and amount to “just a silly response.” “No one wants to sell a lot of Treasuries quickly because they would take losses on their entire portfolio, and Japan's is vast,” Obstfeld said. Moreover, as Obstfeld notes, Japan needs Washington to defend itself in the volatile Asia-Pacific region. Still, the warning from Japan does speak to a broader issue. “Both theory and data show that trade tariffs reduce net capital inflows,” said Kent Smetters, professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Smetters, who runs the Penn Wharton Budget Model, noted that capital was indeed leaving the United States and rates were rising before Trump announced his pause on reciprocal tariffs. “If the tariffs are fully implemented, the US will need to sell its future debt… at lower prices and higher yields,” Smetters said. “More tax cuts, instead of helping offset some of the negative effects of tariffs, will add to the debt at a time when it will become more costly to do so.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The fate of President Donald Trump's controversial nominee to serve as US attorney for Washington, DC, is in question as the president has been making calls to Republican senators on his behalf, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation. Ed Martin did not appear on the agenda for the Senate Judiciary Committee's meeting Thursday – a key deadline for him to be confirmed by May 20, when his interim position expires. The White House and Department of Justice have shepherded Martin through what has so far been a turbulent confirmation, including helping him complete mandated disclosure forms and other paperwork. But Trump, whose calls on Martin's behalf have not been previously reported, may be needed to convince a handful of skeptical Republicans who are putting the nomination at risk. As CNN previously reported, Martin failed to disclose nearly 200 media appearances in his initial disclosures last month, and claimed under oath he did not recall some of his most controversial past statements in response to a series of questions put to him by members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. A committee vote on Martin's nomination has not yet been scheduled. North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN last week he has “serious questions” about Martin, given his previous comments denigrating police officers who defended the US Capitol during the January 6, 2021, attack. “I don't talk about that stuff,” Tillis said when asked if the president had reached out to him. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, who also serve on the panel, have also privately expressed concerns about supporting Martin, a source familiar with the process told CNN. Cornyn told CNN on Monday that Trump had not reached out to him, and he declined to  say how he would vote on the nomination. Grassley told CNN last week that his panel still had not received the necessary paperwork from the FBI to move forward with Martin's nomination. However, a committee aide told CNN Monday that all outstanding materials on Martin have now been received, including the FBI materials Grassley was waiting on. Trump and his allies have a short window to get Martin over the finish line. If Republicans don't confirm him by May 20, there would be a new process to play out in picking a new nominee. One option could be US District Judge James Boasberg appointing someone to become DC's top prosecutor. Boasberg, a Barack Obama appointee, has presided over a number of high-profile cases challenging Trump policies, drawing the ire of the president and his allies. Top Justice Department officials, who had preferred another candidate for the job, have had to caution Martin about some of his public activities since taking on the job on an interim basis, sources briefed on the matter told CNN. Despite growing blowback on the nomination, allies of Trump and Martin have made clear that the president has so far been thrilled with Martin's job performance. “Martin is President Trump's favorite US Attorney,” one source familiar with his nomination process previously told CNN. DOJ officials who may have wanted someone else for the job have come to terms with the fact that he is Trump's pick and are doing everything they can to help get him confirmed, sources briefed on the matter told CNN. Martin has successfully implemented Trump's “law and order agenda” and been a “fantastic U.S. Attorney for D.C.,” said Alex Pfeiffer, White House principal deputy communications director. Martin has had to update his mandated disclosure to Congress detailing all of his past media appearances at least three times after his initial filing  failed to report media appearances he's made in the past few years, including many on far-right outlets and Russian-state media. He has also had to answer for his previous praise of a Capitol rioter who is an alleged Nazi sympathizer, despite his more recent denouncement. During his short tenure as acting US attorney, Martin has drawn attention for having referred to the nation's largest office of federal prosecutors as “President Trumps' [sic] lawyers,” and demoting senior attorneys who worked on January 6, 2021, Capitol riot cases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Barstool Sports' founder said he would send two customers to tour a former Nazi concentration camp after they allegedly engaged in antisemitic behavior at a Barstool pub in Philadelphia, then later retracted that offer for at least one of them because he said the person was denying responsibility for what happened. Related article Temple University student suspended after an antisemitic sign is posted at Barstool sports bar owned by Dave Portnoy But on Monday, Portnoy posted that the customer “did a 180” and told him he had nothing to do with the antisemitic behavior and he was just being a citizen journalist by sharing video of what happened. “His trip to Poland has been revoked,” Portnoy said in the post. Portnoy, who is Jewish, said he has experienced increased antisemitism, as the war between Israel and Hamas continues. The bar said in a statement posted to social media that several employees, against their training and organization's written discrimination policies, complied with a customer's request for the sign in connection with ordering bottle service. “We are saddened, embarrassed, and frustrated by the deplorable actions of a customer and misguided staff,” Barstool Samson Street said in the post. Portnoy said two bar employees had been fired over the incident. The student was put on interim suspension while an investigation continues, President John Fry said in a statement posted on the university's website. Fry called antisemitism “abhorrent” and said he would take further action if other students were involved. “It has no place at Temple and acts of hatred and discrimination against any person or persons are not tolerated at this university,” Fry said. Kappa Delta Rho said in a post on its website that it is also investigating because the customer involved was allegedly a member of their fraternity at Temple. “To be clear, our organization firmly opposes all forms of hate, which have no place in our fraternity,” said Xavier Romano, executive director of the national fraternity. Portnoy had said he hoped to turn the event into a teachable moment. He did not initially identify the culprits but identified one of them on Monday when saying he would not be sending them to Auschwitz. The customer didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. He also owns several Barstool bars in locations around the country.</p>

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? In that post, Libby did not blur or otherwise obscure the high school student's face, and she named the student and her school. In response, Maine House Speaker Ryan Fecteau, a Democrat, asked Libby to remove the post due to concerns “that publicizing the student's identity would threaten the student's health and safety.” When Libby refused, a majority of the state house passed a resolution censuring Libby — that resolution reiterated Fecteau's concern that shining such a spotlight on a high school student “may endanger the minor.” It also highlighted a study showing that “transgender people are over four times more likely to be victims of violence.” Thus far, all of this is fine as a constitutional matter. While Libby has a First Amendment right to speak out against trans rights, government entities like the Maine House also have a right to express their own viewpoints on controversial issues. But Maine's House rules also provide that Libby “may not be allowed to vote or speak” on the House floor until she apologizes for the conduct that resulted in her censure. She refused to do so, and thus has effectively been stripped of her ability to vote on legislation since last winter. This also means that her constituents are effectively stripped of their representation in the state house, because their duly elected representative cannot vote on bills. Indeed, The Supreme Court's decision in Bond v. Floyd (1966), which involved the Georgia House of Representatives' decision not to seat a duly elected lawmaker — ostensibly because he spoke out against the Vietnam War — is almost directly on point. Because the First Amendment protects against government censorship, virtually all free speech cases involve speech that is sufficiently offensive to government officials that they decided to sanction it. Even if the First Amendment does not apply to speech that is somewhat menacing to a minor — itself a dubious proposition — stripping Libby of her voting rights does more than simply strike at her right to free speech. It punishes her constituents by stripping them of their right to representation. At least in that circumstance, the people of her district could elect someone else to cast votes on their behalf. Libby's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to weigh in on this case by Tuesday, when the Maine House convenes for a floor session. That won't happen, as Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who oversees emergency requests to her Court that arise out of Maine's federal courts, set a May 8 deadline for the state legislature to respond to Libby's arguments. The case arises on the Court's “shadow docket,” a mix of emergency motions and other expedited matters that the justices used to be very cautious about deciding prematurely before President Donald Trump's first term. Regardless of what anyone thinks about Libby's attack on a high school student, allowing lawmakers to strip their colleagues of their ability to vote on legislation would set an alarming precedent that could easily be used by authoritarian legislators to stifle dissent. A federal district judge denied relief to Libby on the grounds that the legislature's decision to sanction her is protected by “legislative immunity.” An appeals court issued a brief decision denying Libby an emergency order immediately reinstating her voting rights, but the case remains pending before that court. As the Court said in Powell v. McCormack (1969), it is intended to ensure that “legislators are free to represent the interests of their constituents without fear that they will be later called to task in the courts for that representation.” If this tax is illegal, a beetroot farmer might file a lawsuit against the state's taxing agency seeking to be reimbursed for paying it. While this framework protects lawmakers from being hauled off into court, it is not intended to render illegal legislation — or, in the Libby case, an illegal sanction imposed on a lawmaker — entirely immune from judicial review. In the Powell case, for example, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a duly-elected member of Congress that the US House refused to seat, in large part because of corruption allegations against that lawmaker. Though legislative immunity might have prevented that unseated lawmaker, New York's Rep. Adam Clayton Powell, from suing the actual members of Congress who voted to unseat him, the Court allowed his suit to proceed against the House Sergeant at Arms — who was responsible for paying House members. “Although an action against a Congressman may be barred” by the Constitution, Powell concluded, “legislative employees who participated in the unconstitutional activity are responsible for their acts.” Though Libby's suit against Fecteau should be precluded by legislative immunity, she also sued Robert Hunt, the clerk of the Maine House who is responsible for tallying votes cast by representatives. She seeks an injunction requiring Hunt to count her votes. The district judge, for what it is worth, claimed that Bond and Powell do not apply to the Libby case because, in both of those cases, a lawmaker was removed from a legislature entirely, while Libby was merely sanctioned until she apologizes. Powell established that “legislative employees” like Hunt can be sued for “unconstitutional activity” generally, regardless of whether that activity results in someone being removed from their job as a lawmaker. Though his colleagues claimed that they refused to seat him because of his views on the Vietnam War, Bond's race almost certainly drove many of his unreconstructed colleagues to lock him out of office. The Maine House's decision to strip Libby of her voting rights is also evocative of a more recent incident, where Tennessee's Republican-controlled House voted to expel two Black Democratic lawmakers under circumstances which strongly suggested that their race motivated this expulsion. (The legislature backed down after both lawmakers were reelected.) Libby, who was sanctioned for bullying a teenager, hardly occupies the same moral high ground as Julian Bond. Otherwise, any lawmaker who is in the minority within their legislative body could be targeted by colleagues who want to silence them and to disenfranchise their constituents. Trump filled the Supreme Court bench with anti-government saboteurs. Trump's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to reinstate his ban on trans military service, after a lower court blocked it. Many of the justices seemed eager to impose impossible burdens on schools. ﻿In an unusual overnight order, most of the justices voted to halt several illegal deportations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republicans are gearing up for what is likely to be a brutal battle to select a GOP challenger for Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) next year in one of Democrats' most vulnerable seats. The focus quickly turned to other possible GOP challengers, including one that national Republicans behind the scenes particularly want to avoid: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA). He, of course, would have been a great candidate,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) said. Thune, prompted if Greene could win a statewide contest amid concerns in the party that her firebrand style of politics could be a liability with swing voters, offered little reassurance of her candidate quality. Obviously, that's up to the people of Georgia,” he said. There was little surprise to Kemp's decision from those familiar with Georgia GOP politics who saw him as having nominal interest in the gig, even as he was lobbied by top Republican senators. “To Republicans nationally: don't give up on us,” Brian Robinson, a Georgia-based GOP strategist who worked for Kemp's predecessor, former Georgia GOP Gov. “We didn't get Plan A, but Plan B is going to probably be OK. We just need the party primary electorate to act and vote strategically. Democrats were quick to label the recruiting blunder an early boost for Ossoff, the first-term, purple-state senator who ousted former GOP Sen. David Perdue in 2020 by just 1.2 percentage points. It whacked Ossoff for leaning into rhetoric that President Donald Trump has committed impeachable acts in his second term. “While Jon Ossoff is running to impeach President Trump, Republicans have a number of strong candidates who can build a winning coalition to add this seat to President Trump's Senate majority,” said Joanna Rodriguez, a spokesperson for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Kemp is but the latest current or former governor with national name recognition to decline a Senate run in their home state, joining the likes of Gov. Meanwhile, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) is looking to leave Washington with a run for governor as Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) weigh their own possible gubernatorial campaigns. Recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution polling showed Kemp with the strongest odds among Republicans of unseating Ossoff. Greene, King, and Raffensperger lost by at least 9 points or more. Greene polled the lowest against Ossoff, with 37% to his 54%. Greene has a close relationship with him, and Jack is being encouraged by Trump to run, according to a source familiar with the race. “Whoever it is, the Republicans have got to be strategic,” Robinson said, adding that the GOP can't make the mistakes of 2022 and “put forward a candidate that couldn't win, that wasn't serious.” David Sivak and Samantha-Jo Roth contributed to this report.</p>

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? During his first term, Trump tried to withhold federal public safety grants from states and localities that refused to allow local law enforcement to share information with federal immigration agents or hand over immigrants in their custody. Now the fight is back: Trump issued an executive order in January to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities and counties under US immigration law. The Department of Justice issued a subsequent memo implementing that order. What's different this time is the lack of uniform opposition from Democratic leadership in some of those cities and states as the party struggles to chart a path forward on immigration. So far, the courts are siding with local officials. In April, a federal judge again struck down both the executive order and the DOJ directive as unconstitutional, ruling that they violated protections for the separation of powers, Congress's spending powers, and due process, as well as sought to unlawfully coerce local officials into enforcing federal immigration law. This time, he used a more extensive legal toolkit. In addition to invoking federal immigration law and his constitutional authority to protect the US from “invasion,” he accuses sanctuary cities and states of crimes — including conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and harboring illegal aliens — as a basis to take away their funding. “The Trump Administration is attempting to create a culture of fear by trumpeting executive orders and inhumane policies that target our immigrant communities,” they said. “California is not hiding the fact that we have chosen to focus our resources on public safety instead of immigration enforcement.” But it's not clear that everyone in blue states is ready to resist. Defending sanctuary policies presents a messaging challenge for Democrats. Trump's immigration policies helped propel him to victory in 2024 and remain one of the more popular elements of his agenda, even if support for them has slipped a bit recently. Trump's legal battle over sanctuary cities in his first term ended without a conclusion: The case was still before the Supreme Court when he left office, and then President Joe Biden asked the justices to dismiss it, refusing to defend his predecessor's efforts to slash funding. But now Trump is trying to revive that legal battle. Naureen Shah, director of government affairs for the ACLU's Equality Division, argued that his latest executive order has “no legal basis,” framing it as “another example of President Trump's relentless campaign to attack the integrity of our legal system and separation of powers by targeting judges, lawyers, and other officials who refuse to comply with his extreme agenda.” “His latest executive order is a dangerous overreach targeting sanctuary cities and does nothing to address the real challenges of our broken immigration system,” Cleveland Mayor Justin M. Bibb said in a statement on behalf of the association. No lawsuit has been filed against the new executive order yet. But with millions on the line, it's likely to come soon. Trump is expected to appeal any ruling in favor of sanctuary cities, potentially taking it all the way to the Supreme Court yet again. The national debate over sanctuary policies comes at a precarious moment for Democrats on immigration. For a while, immigration was buoying Trump's approval ratings. However, concerns about Trump's deportations of undocumented immigrants to El Salvador — including Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who the government admits was deported in error — seem to have recently put a dent in Trump's poll numbers. That has put Democrats in a difficult position, as they face internal disagreements on how to handle the immigration issue. Some have been subdued in their defense of sanctuary policies. How should Democrats talk about immigration in the face of a public that remains skeptical of it, but also increasingly concerned about Trump's approach to enforcement? It started on the 2024 campaign trail, when vulnerable Democrats, including former Sens. Gavin Newsom — who called himself a “poster child for sanctuary policy” during his 2017 campaign — has refrained from even using the word “sanctuary” publicly. Wes Moore has advocated for due process in Abrego Garcia's case and has said that he would protect Marylanders in the face of Trump's immigration policies. But he hasn't ruled out cooperating with US Immigration Customs and Enforcement, saying in January that local cities and counties need to “follow the Constitution” while declining to elaborate on what that meant. San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan has objected to the term “sanctuary,” telling CalMatters that it's been “politicized by both ends of the ideological spectrum.” San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie has also avoided using the term “sanctuary” and refused to sign a nonbinding resolution reaffirming the city's sanctuary protections, saying it was his policy to “not to comment or act on urging resolutions.” New York City Mayor Eric Adams has signaled an openness to working with the Trump administration to arrest certain immigrants connected to “violent migrant gangs.” Though his case is unique given the controversies that have haunted his administration, and he is running for reelection as an independent. Adams met with Trump “border czar” Tom Homan earlier this year and issued an executive order to reopen US Immigration and Customs Enforcement's ICE's office on Rikers Island, the city's largest jail, a move that the city council has sought to block. The New York City comptroller has also demanded that Adams recuse himself from all matters related to the city's sanctuary policies, including any response to Trump's latest executive order that could see the city stripped of federal grants. Earlier this year, Adams was accused of making a “quid pro quo” deal with the Trump administration to cooperate on immigration enforcement in exchange for federal prosecutors dropping criminal charges against him; Adams has denied those allegations. The Adams administration has been “muted, if not muzzled, in its response to the very clear and explicit threats to our City's federal funding and New Yorkers' civil liberties,” Comptroller Brad Lander wrote in a letter to Adams on April 29. A representative for Adams' office contested that the mayor has taken steps to advocate for New Yorkers when the federal government threatened the city's FEMA funding, an offshore wind project, and congestion pricing plan, saying that Lander's demands were “desperate and detached from reality.” The tensions over sanctuary policies suggest that Democrats haven't yet reached a resolution. Fascism, Bolton told Vox, is “too far above Trump's capabilities.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Celebrities from the film, fashion, music, sports, politics and social media worlds ascended the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Monday to sip cocktails, have dinner and were dressed to the nines in their best ode to Black dandyism. Tonya Lewis Lee, left, and Spike Lee attend The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute benefit gala celebrating the opening of the “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” exhibition on Monday, May 5, 2025, in New York.

Keith Powers attends The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute benefit gala celebrating the opening of the “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” exhibition on Monday, May 5, 2025, in New York. NEW YORK (AP) — “Well, it took a minute,” said Spike Lee, surveying the glittering Met Gala crowd during cocktail hour through bright orange glasses that matched his New York Knicks cap. “But we're here now, that's the most important thing.” Lee was referring to the fact that for the very first time, the Met Gala was making a point of celebrating Black style and Black designers — a milestone he felt was overdue, but very welcome. And who knows what's gonna happen because of this event? There's gonna be reverberations around the world.” Lee was echoing an excitement that many of the approximately 400 guests — luminaries in sports, music, fashion, film, theater and more — shared as they sipped cocktails or toured the gala's accompanying exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” The show is an exploration of Black menswear from the 18th century onward, with dandyism as a unifying theme. Another film director, Baz Luhrmann, was touring the exhibit, designed by guest curator Monica L. Miller, a Barnard professor who literally wrote the book on dandyism: “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity.” Luhrmann, too, mused on the importance of this year's theme. But this is a subject where you go, why has light not been shone on this before?” Luhrmann said. It was her late friend, André Leon Talley, the fashion editor who was so important to Black style, and with whom she'd attended previous galas. And Costume Institute curator Andrew Bolton has said he was an inspiration for the show. “I think they did him proud,” Goldberg said during cocktails. “I'm very happy to be here again, but spectacularly happy to see how they took care of him.” Asked what Talley would have thought of the show, she guessed he'd say: “I'm glad you understand.” '” Goldberg said of Browne, whose suits, particularly, are hugely popular. For Lee, it was simple: “Doing your own thing.” Tonya Lewis Lee, left, and Spike Lee attend The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute benefit gala celebrating the opening of the “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” exhibition on Monday, May 5, 2025, in New York. For Audra McDonald, it was about “a sense of reclaiming” one's own identity and worth. Al Sharpton was describing dandyism as a form of activism: “It means to me that even in the midst of being in a socially limited situation, we celebrate. Sharpton was full of praise for the Met having chosen this moment to honor Black style. “It comes at a very important time,” he said. “To make a statement of diversity at the highest cultural level — which is the Met Gala — when diversity is under attack by the highest office in the land is more than if I could do a hundred marches. Colman Domingo, a co-chair who spoke movingly earlier Monday about how male relatives — his stepfather, father and brother — taught him about style, was yet more emotional at the gala, where he described dandyism as “a form of resistance.” “It feels right on the money that I am in this moment,” said the 55 year-old actor, who recounted becoming more stylistically self-assured with each passing decade, and less concerned with what others think. It was Broadway actor Alex Newell's third Met Gala in a row. This one had a special meaning, the performer noted. “It's nice to see us represented this way,” Newell said. Many also expressed deep pride in the fact that this year's gala brought in a record haul of more than $31 million, as Met officials confirmed on Monday. Once gala guests climb the steps outside and enter the museum's Great Hall, they encounter each year a monumental centerpiece, usually floral. This year, it was thousands of flower petals suspended from the ceiling, with lighting evoking a starry sky. The petals — made of fabric, truth be told — were meant to symbolize narcissus flowers, and there were also reflecting pools, nodding to the myth of Narcissus. The greeting was not only visual but musical: An orchestra, accompanied by swaying singers, played favorites like Al Green's “Let's Stay Together” and Stevie Wonder's “Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing,” Guests then either proceeded to view the exhibit, or head straight to cocktails in the airy Engelhard Court. Often, they seem to prefer socializing, but this year the exhibit was filled with guests. One of the more famous dandies, historically speaking, was Oscar Wilde. And so there was symmetry in the fact that Sarah Snook — the “Succession” star — was dressed in a way Wilde would have liked. Snook now is appearing on Broadway in “The Picture of Dorian Gray,” the stage adaptation of Wilde's 1891 novel in which she plays all 26 roles. “Yes, There's definitely an echo,” Snook said with a smile, about her striking (and aristocratic-looking) black satin tuxedo ensemble, by anOnlyChild. Snook said she was enjoying her night off at the gala — conveniently for the many guests from Broadway, theaters are dark on Mondays. “I'm loving the celebration of beautiful things,” she said. Hats, a key element of dandy style, were everywhere. Top hats like Goldberg's were especially popular, but then there were the wide-brimmed ones that threatened to shield a celebrity face just a bit too much. Zendaya, smashing in an all-white Louis Vuitton ensemble by gala co-host Pharrell Williams, sported a huge floppy white hat. Getting up from her seat in the cocktail party, she started to put it back on, and Luhrmann, who was chatting with her, helped her find just the right angle. She laughed and went off to chat with Diana Ross. At every Met Gala, there are newbies — and they're often rather starstruck. One of them was model Christian Latchman, 19, wearing a dramatic white ensemble that combined trousers with a long skirt. Asked to sum up his feelings about the evening, he said simply: “Astonishment. Cocktails are fun, but dinner at the Met Gala sounds even more fun — that's where guests get an A-plus musical performance, for one thing. But music also accompanies the call to dinner. This time, it was the New York-based High and Mighty Brass Band who did the honors, snaking through cocktails with drums, trombones, a tuba and trumpets. Then guests headed off — slowly — to dinner, where they feasted on a menu by chef Kwame Onwuachi. Dinner began with papaya piri piri salad, and moved on to creole roasted chicken with a lemon emulsion, and cornbread with honey curry butter and barbecue greens. That was a “cosmic brownie” with powdered sugar doughnut mousse. Even megastars have to play by the rules. At the check-in tables, right after the carpet madness, guests were politely asked to hand over their phones, for a piece of tape to be applied to the cameras. Did some remove it later, to snap a few fun shots? For more coverage of the 2025 Met Gala, visit https://apnews.com/hub/met-gala.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) called for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to be fired over additional accusations of communications on a nongovernmental messaging service. A Monday report from the Wall Street Journal alleged that Hegseth used Signal as part of his job much more extensively than previously known, engaging in at least 12 different chats on the unsecured app. Hegseth reportedly used Signal to discuss media appearances, foreign travel, scheduling, and other unclassified but sensitive information. Smith became one of the first to demand his removal from his position after the accusations. Fired,” the senator wrote in a post on X. Though the allegations are new, Smith's call isn't — she has been calling for Hegseth's removal since Signalgate first broke in March. “Pete Hegseth should follow Pete Hegseth's advice and resign,” she said in a video posted to her Facebook last month, going on to outline the allegations against his usage of the app. “This is the height of recklessness and irresponsibility, and you don't have to take my word for this,” Smith added, showing an old clip of the then-Fox News host calling on figures who improperly handled information to resign. She has been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration, often using vulgarity to get her point across. In March, she refused to backtrack after calling Elon Musk “a d***” and “billionaire a**‑hole boss.” “People want to see fight,” she told CNN at the time. “And I think with that tweet that I did, it touched a nerve with millions of people because everybody has had the experience of having some boss who treats them with disrespect, who denigrates their work and is just basically using big power-play moves to … terrorize them.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump, left, poses for a photo with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, June 29, 2019. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba speaks to reporters reacting after a Japanese negotiator held ministerial talks at the White House regarding U.S. tariffs, at the prime minister's office in Tokyo, Japan, Thursday, April 17, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — Just as Japan's top trade negotiator traveled to Washington for another round of tariff talks last week, a bipartisan delegation bearing the name of “Japan-China Friendship” wrapped up a visit to Beijing. A week earlier, the head of the junior party in Japan's ruling coalition was in Beijing delivering a letter from Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba addressed to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Among all U.S. allies being wooed by Beijing in its tariff stare-down with Washington, Japan stands out. There's a lot that connects Japan and China,” said Matthew Goodman, director of the Greenberg Center for Geoeconomics at the Council on Foreign Relations. Still, Trump's 25% tax on aluminum, steel and auto exports have gone into effect for Japan. The tariff moves, as well as Trump's “America First” agenda, have cast doubts among the Japanese if the United States is still a dependable ally, while China is rallying support from tariff-threatened countries — including Japan. When Tetsuo Saito led Japan's Komeito Party delegation to Beijing in late April, China hinted at difficulty in its tariff dispute with the United States, signaling its willingness to improve ties with Tokyo. An unnamed senior Chinese official said his country was “in trouble” when discussing Trump's 145% tariff on Chinese products, according to Japanese reports. Zhao Leji, Beijing's top legislator, told the delegation that China's National People's Congress would be “willing to carry out various forms of dialogue and exchanges.” Beijing banned Japan's seafood products in 2023, citing those concerns. Ties between Tokyo and Beijing have long been rocky. Tokyo's closer ties with Washington during Joe Biden's presidency also upset Beijing, which saw it as part of the U.S. strategy to contain China and has lectured Tokyo to “face squarely and reflect on the history of aggression.” An imperial power in Asia for centuries, China fell behind Japan in the 19th century when Japan began to embrace Western industrialization and grew into a formidable economic and military power. Ishiba, elected Japan's prime minister in October, has a more neutral view on his country's wartime history than the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his two successors. Weeks after taking office, Ishiba held talks with Xi on the sidelines of a leaders' summit. Chinese scholars, however, see Tokyo's recent engagements with Beijing as a pragmatic move to hedge against U.S. protectionism and not a long-term strategy for stability with China. The odds are low for Japan to move into China's orbit, Goodman said. “They have for a long time had to manage an important but challenging relationship with China,” he said. “And that is, again, a long-standing problem for Japan, going back centuries or millennia.” While Japan might welcome the friendlier tone from Beijing, it is trying to stabilize Japan-U.S. relations under Trump's “America First” agenda, and it is hoping to settle the tariff dispute without confronting Washington, with an eye on preventing Beijing from exploiting any fallout in Japan-U.S. relations. Japan was among the first countries to hold tariff talks with Washington. After the second round of negotiation in Washington last week, Ryosei Akazawa, the country's chief tariff negotiator, said he pushed Japan's request that the U.S. drop tariffs and was continuing efforts toward an agreement acceptable to both sides. Asked about China, Akazawa said only that his country keeps watching the U.S.-China tariff development “with great interest.” He noted Japan's deep trade ties with China. While China and Japan are working to mend ties, the two are also competing in the Southeast Asia region, where Trump has threatened high tariffs as well. The region is deeply integrated into China's supply chain but under pressure from the West to diversify and reduce its reliance on China. With younger and growing populations as compared to East Asia, the region is considered an important growth center. Japan, as a major postwar development aid contributor, has gradually regained trust in the region, which also was scarred by Japan's World War II past. During the visit, Ishiba stressed Japan's commitment to maintaining and strengthening a multilateral free-trade system in each country. Ishiba also had telephone talks with his Malaysian and Singaporean counterparts earlier this month about U.S. tariffs. At a recent discussion at the Washington-based think tank Hudson Institute, Itsunori Onodera, Japan's governing party policy chief, warned of “very unstable” feelings among many Asian countries faced with high tariffs from the United States.</p>

(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP, File) New York Islanders pro scouting director Ken Morrow knows a thing or two about so-called hockey miracles. 1 pick represented yet another memorable moment for the four-time Stanley Cup champion and member of the 1980 gold-medal-winning “Miracle on Ice” U.S. Olympic team. “I've had a lot of thrills in my hockey life, but this is right up there at the top,” Morrow said. “The hockey gods smiled on us. I can't tell you how thrilled I am for Islanders fans, for our ownership, for the entire Islanders organization.” The Islanders, who missed the playoffs for the second time in four seasons, are in the midst of a front-office shakeup after not renewing general manager Lou Lamoriello's contract on April 22. And they earned a remarkable lottery win by entering the day with a 3.5% shot — the 10th-best odds — of seeing their numbers come up. “A couple of seconds ago, we were just like 10 back, so it still hasn't sunk in,” Utah GM Bill Armstrong said of a first-year franchise that finished just seven points out of a playoff spot. “This is an exciting moment for us. San Jose, which finished last for a second consecutive year, was seeking to become the NHL's first team to win the lottery and pick first in consecutive years. “We definitely lucked it out last year to be able to select Mac,” Sharks GM Mike Grier said in referring to selecting Boston University center Macklin Celebrini first overall. But picking two, we're still in a pretty good spot so we're happy.” The remaining 12 teams moved two spots back in the order, starting with Nashville dropping from third to fifth. This year's draft will be held in Los Angeles with the first round taking place on June 27, followed by the final six rounds the next day. Top prospects will convene for the weeklong predraft combine being held in Buffalo next month. The prospect pool is not considered as deep at the top as last year's class, or next year's group, with Canadian junior forward Gavin McKenna long regarded as the No. Erie Otters defenseman Matthew Schaefer is NHL Central Scouting's top-ranked North American prospect followed by OHL Saginaw center Michael Misa and Boston College center James Hagens, the top-ranked U.S. born prospect. Hagens is from Long Island and grew up an Islanders fan. Listed at 6-foot-2 and 183 pounds, Schaefer maintained his No. 1 position despite missing the final three months of the season after breaking his right collarbone representing Canada at the world junior championships in December. And he also has the chance of being the first OHL player to go No. 1 since Edmonton drafted Erie's Connor McDavid in 2015. The top-ranked international skaters are center Anton Frondell and right wing Victor Eklund, who are teammates with Djurgarden of Sweden's second division league. New York's jump from 10th to first is the biggest involving a team winning the No. 1 in 2020, when they were grouped among eight teams — ranked eighth to 15th — with the same odds to win the lottery after being eliminated in the COVID-altered play-in round of the expanded 24-team playoff format. Previously, the lottery was held shortly before the broadcast in front of a limited audience of sequestered observers, followed by the draft selections being revealed in reverse order.

Gerry Connolly (D-VA) announced his cancer had returned and he would be stepping away from his leadership position “soon.”Last week, Ocasio-Cortez said there wasn't a “vacancy to run for,” and then told reporters that she was “weighing” a bid. However, on Monday, she announced she would not be seeking the committee's gavel, blaming the caucus's views on seniority as a factor.“It's actually clear to me that the underlying dynamics in the caucus have not shifted with respect to seniority as much as I think would be necessary, and so I believe, I'll be staying put at energy and commerce,” the New York congresswoman said.Had Ocasio-Cortez wanted to run for the position, she would have needed a waiver to return to the committee. She sits on the Energy and Commerce Committee, an “exclusive” panel that, under House rules, muddles her ability to also hold a spot on the Oversight Committee.House Democrats have been facing a generational crisis in the aftermath of the 2024 election, with several younger House members challenging long-term leaders for committee ranking member slots, as many argued it was time for fresh blood in the ranks after Republicans' sweeping victories.Rep. Angie Craig (D-MN) was the only younger member to successfully gain a leadership spot in a contested committee election last December. She is now running for the open Senate seat in Minnesota, but the congresswoman's office told the Washington Examiner she will remain in her role as ranking member on the House Agriculture Committee.Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) serves as Natural Resources Committee ranking member, but his competition, the late Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), withdrew from the race.Ocasio-Cortez passing on a run for the ranking membership does not come as a major shakeup, considering she has been raising significant funds that surpass a typical House member's war chest for reelection in a safe blue seat — amounting to $10 million, a nod that she could be seeking a presidential run or Senate challenge to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).She's also spending considerable time on the road, drawing large crowds during her and Sen. Bernie Sanders's (I-VT) “Fighting Oligarchy” tour in red and blue states.In the interim, Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-MD) will take over Connolly's ranking member duties, and he said in a statement he has the elder congressman's support if Lynch seeks to remain in the position permanently.Other members have been floated for the position, including Reps. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX), Maxwell Frost (D-FL), and Ro Khanna (D-CA).</p>
