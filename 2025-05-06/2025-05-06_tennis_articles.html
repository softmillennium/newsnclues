I think—I don't know—you guys like to make some articles that will attract people. It's part of the job,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After what played out at the Mutua Madrid Open, it was natural for a reporter in Rome to ask Alexander Zverev if he was happy to see the upcoming French Open stick with traditional lines-people over electronic line calling (ELC).“They still going to have that? Well, it screwed me last year,” he said with a smile Tuesday.Zverev is back at the Foro Italico to defend his Internazionali BNL d'Italia crown.

Despite that incident, Zverev clarified it's still his preferred methodology for detemining whether shots are in or out.“To be honest, I like the electronic line calling. I still think that it's the right way to go forward, too. When mistakes happen like this in Madrid, maybe they have to readjust it for the next day, readjust the system a little bit.” “To be honest, I like the electronic line calling. I think there was absolutely no mistakes in Monte Carlo, there were no mistakes in Munich. I still think that it's the right way to go forward, too.

I think there was absolutely no mistakes in Monte Carlo, there were no mistakes in Munich. As for how to account for an erroneous miscue made by technology, Zverev conceded he didn't have the perfect solve to offer up.“It's not for me to decide. But when it's clear like that, then maybe the umpire should be able to come down from the chair. If we're talking about three, four, five centimeters, then maybe.” But when it's clear like that, then maybe the umpire should be able to come down from the chair.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zverev, who is still seeking his first Grand Slam title, said he should in retrospect have taken time off after losing to Jannik Sinner in straight sets in the Australian Open final at the end of January. Defending Rome Open champion Alexander Zverev said he is now on a “good path”, putting a poor run of form following his defeat in the Australian Open final down to burn-out. The 28-year-old world number two put an end to the dry run -- which included opening round defeats in Indian Wells and Monte Carlo -- by winning the ATP title in Munich in mid-April. The German, who is still seeking his first Grand Slam title, said he should in retrospect have taken time off after losing to Jannik Sinner in straight sets in the Australian Open final at the end of January. “Before Munich obviously my level of play wasn't great,” he said at Tuesday's press conference. I think not taking time off after Australia was a big reason for it. Zverev said the life of a professional tennis player was an incessant cycle of travelling and playing without any time to rest. First of all, we don't give our bodies rest, but we also don't give our heads rest. I needed that a little bit,” he said.

He said he was not the only one who had been struggling lately with former number ones and multiple Grand Slam champions Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz also enduring some tough times. “I do think the media also loves to put players down, right?” he said. “I had a bad two months before Munich, right? “I didn't play great tennis before Munich. All of a sudden I'm like the worst world No. Zverev is hoping a good title defence in Rome will set him up to go one better than last year at the French Open and be crowned champion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Perhaps it should come as no surprise, then, that the 22-year-old version of that kid has a yearning to dust off her textbooks. ‘I'm going to start studying more,' says Raducanu, in a joint interview with Mail Sport and the Guardian at the Italian Open. I've missed it for the last few years. I need something to stimulate and engage my brain so my entire life isn't just tennis.' ‘Growing up, I always had tennis as an escape from studying and studying as an escape from tennis. I love those moments on my own, quiet reading in the library, figuring things out myself. ‘In this life, where it's so busy and there's so many people around, as you see (she gestures around the buzzing terrace of the Foro Italico) it's nice to have that little retreat. What would that third A Level be (to go with maths and economics)? The subject arose from a question about Carlos Alcaraz's new documentary. The Spaniard said his greatest fear is for tennis to become an obligation - has the sport ever felt like that for Raducanu since her title in New York? I want to do things in a different way. ‘I'm working on a few things, in my game and off the court, setting up my life in different ways.' It is no wonder Raducanu, a naturally curious and introspective soul, has been thinking things over recently. A back spasm which ruined her pre-season. The departure of trusted coach Nick Cavaday for health reasons. The terror of being stalked across four countries. A coaching trial with Vlado Platenik which ended after just two weeks. The upshot of that abrupt parting from Platenik in Miami was an on-the-hoof partnership with Mark Petchey. What began as a stop-gap has become a more permanent, if informal, arrangement, and Raducanu talks for the first time about how that alliance came about. ‘It happened completely by chance,' she says. He's someone that I trust so we were just talking. And it was him not wanting to push himself.' Also in Rome is Jane O'Donoghue, her childhood coach turned financier. Raducanu reveals that O'Donoghue has taken a couple of months off her job in the city to be here for the clay court swing and into the grass. She has previously only done a week here and there. Raducanu knows her own mind and is fiercely loyal to those who knew her before fame and fortune. ‘I am very independent and that definitely comes from my mum,' she says. ‘She's the strongest person I know, has gone through so much in life and she's always taught me to rely on people as little as possible. ‘But sometimes you do need to lean on people. I have become less afraid to do that. ‘It takes a lot for me to open up. I haven't truly opened up to many people in my life. I have been burned a few times, a few people who I've really trusted have surprised me. ‘It's very difficult for me to trust new people. Up to 18, I was just with my parents. It was like nothing could touch me. And then all of a sudden everyone came and I got burned quite a lot of times, whether that's professionally or personally. Raducanu's path of self discovery continues as she grows up under the beam of a most intent spotlight. She begins her Italian Open campaign on Wednesday against a qualifier.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Italian tennis has been punching far above its weight lately, producing the country's first world No. 1 in Jannik Sinner and a bevy of young talent, despite operating with far less money and less than 20 percent of America's population. So when the U.S. Tennis Association (USTA) embarked on a reorganization of its player development system, its leaders put the Italian Tennis Federation (FITP) under a microscope to try to figure out the ingredients and recipe for their secret sauce. Everyone in the sport watched the past 10 years as Italy added a slew of lower-level professional tournaments, giving its players far more local opportunities to compete without frittering money and time on travel. It built more hard courts to prepare its talents for a circuit that plays on them more than any other surface. “They heavily go strong on sports science support between 15, 16, and 17,” Tracy Davies, a longtime USTA executive who recently became the general manager of USA Tennis, the organization's newly created high-performance division, said in an interview. Tyra Grant, a rising figure in the women's game with an American father and Italian mother, in April decided to switch to il tricolore. Grant, 17, was born and raised in Italy, but had spent significant time in the U.S. through her childhood and much of the past 18 months of her professional development using the national USTA campus in Orlando, Fla. as her home base. During a roundtable in Rome, Grant said that she switched because she had more of an affinity with Italy. Nearly 20 years ago, when a golden generation of Spanish players dominated the top of men's tennis, the United States Tennis Association built a player development system based on the Spanish machine. The U.S. player development program has not exactly been a flop. There are four American women in the WTA top 10 and four American men in the ATP top 16. Madison Keys won the Australian Open just this year; Taylor Fritz and Jessica Pegula reached the U.S. Open singles finals in 2024. But for years now on the men's side, only unicorns with the rarest of innate tennis gifts have been reaching that lofty plateau of Grand Slam champion. She proved to be an overnight success story 16 years in the making. Lew Sherr, who became USTA chief executive three years ago, had not planned on restructuring a player development program that had enjoyed significant success. When the Covid-19 pandemic brought a few lean years to the world's most profitable tennis federation, Sherr focused on maintaining, and then growing participation as opposed to elite performance coaching. Then the man who orchestrated much of that successful player development program during the past 15 years decided to weigh in. Jose Higueras, who coached Jim Courier and Roger Federer at their pinnacles, led the player development program at the USTA from 2008 to 2014 and served as a consultant for several years after that. He watched with a combination of fear and anger as the organization cut back on elite coaching and training for rising juniors. “The current leadership has veered off course, deliberately cutting funding and staffing for the Team USA pathway and American players, while they waste millions of dollars on boondoggles like unnecessary building renovations at the USTA Campus in Lake Nona and a million-dollar holiday party. Brian Vahaly, a former professional who took over as president of the USTA in January, said in an interview in April that creating a new generation of stars and growing participation are not mutually exclusive missions. “American success is incredibly important to us getting there,” Vahaly said. Stars, he said, make television ratings spike and inspire kids to play, just as he was inspired as a child by meeting Michael Chang. “We are seeing tremendous demand in our sport and that's coinciding at a time when we have a really large amount of top 100 players that are Americans,” Vahaly said. USA Tennis now includes everything from player development to junior competitions, international team events and managing all professional tournaments other than the U.S. Open — all with one eye across the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean. “You look to learn from countries like Italy and others that are finding success,” said Vahaly. “We'd be crazy not to learn from other countries and what they're doing really well.” Last year there were about 110 but many were — and still are — at the lower end on the International Tennis Federation (ITF) circuit. Those events are useful for the most elite juniors, like 17-year-old American Iva Jovic, who won her first title on that circuit when she was 14 and has since won main-draw matches at Grand Slams. But it's the ATP Challenger and WTA 125 circuits, which are the second tiers of professional tennis, that truly mould players. At the highest level, more and more ATP and WTA 1,000 events (one rung below a Grand Slam) now run for a fortnight. That leaves a lot of losers hanging around with a week or more to kill, and a good deal of them enter Challenger and WTA 125 events to get some reps. Being able to get that kind of experience on home soil, without the costs of international travel and accommodation, is invaluable to rising players. The USTA, which provides about $10 million in subsidies at these professional events, mostly for prize money, is pushing to add more events at the higher end of those tiers, targeting as much as an annual 30 percent increase. Tournaments with more prize money and points are more attractive to better competition; investing in domestic events may be a more efficient use of money than paying for a handful of top players and coaches to travel to Europe for tournaments. The U.S. is home to some 14,000 junior tournaments, more than any other country. Davenport's son, Jagger Leach, won the boys' singles title at Indian Wells in March and plans to attend Texas Christian University, the program that nurtured British players Cameron Norrie and Jacob Fearnley. 1 and a father who was an All-American at the University of Southern California. Still, Davenport told Davies that her son might have benefitted from having more consistent coaching in USTA programs. Like most tennis federations, the USTA generally has coaches who work with younger players, and then others who take them on as they progress through their teenage years. Italy went the other way, introducing a network of regional performance centers to offer local resource while keeping players in the same environment, and with the same coaches, for as long as possible. Sinner's formative years were not in an FITP center, but at a private academy, the Piatti Tennis Center in Bordighera. The organization has Larry Lauer, a longtime sports psychologist, leading its mental skills department. Players have been hiring their own mental performance coaches at younger ages, but there are a lot of talented players at the lower end of the income scale who can't afford that. “Just going back and continuing to remind ourselves, it's not about me, you know, or anyone, or what their past results are playing,” Davies said. If there is an irony in all this, it's that one of Italy's most important innovations is right in the U.S. tennis wheelhouse. Sinner has followed him and transfigured men's tennis into a game of attack or be attacked from anywhere in the court, alongside Carlos Alcaraz, his biggest rival. But in that fallow period for male American Grand Slam champions since Roddick, clay-court skills — use of angles over linear ballstriking, variety, lateral movement and rally tolerance — defined the evolution in men's tennis. Italy's hard-court boom may yet create a best-of-both worlds training environment, but the U.S. tennis landscape is yet to embrace a similar hybridity. The USTA doesn't have to lift a finger to get players hard-court experience, since those courts dominate American tennis. The clay experience, specifically the red clay experience, which they know from experience can be so helpful, is always a work in progress, because there just isn't all that much of it in America. Many others have to use green clay as a substitute. Higueras, who lives on a ranch in Palm Springs, Calif., said he wasn't consulted on any of the changes. Reached last week and informed that the letter had caused Sherr to focus more heavily on player development, Higueras was magnanimous. “I wish them all the best,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer won final grand slam titles at the same age. His conqueror that day had a much longer career and played until he was 33. But McEnroe, like Borg, won his last grand slam singles title at 25. Back in those old days of the first phase of Open tennis (which I'll date from 1968-1985; most of the top pros didn't start playing the Australian Open regularly until the mid-1980s), players reached their peaks in their mid-20s and winning majors as one approached 30 was considered unusual. Consider, when Jimmy Connors, the other figure of that bygone's era “big three” won Wimbledon and the US Open in 1982 it was roundly applauded as a brilliant end-of-career comeback. For most of the great men's champions of the last 60 years, their final title in a major was achieved around 30, if not earlier: Rod Laver (31), John Newcombe (31), Arthur Ashe (32), Ivan Lendl (29), Mats Wilander (24), Stefan Edberg (26), Boris Becker (28), Jim Courier (22), Pete Sampras (31), and Andre Agassi (32). For the most prolific champions of the Open era, most women won their final grand slam singles title around the age of 30: Margaret Court notched her last slam at 31, a similar mark to Billie Jean King (31), Chris Evert (32), Martina Navratilova (33), Steffi Graf (29), Monica Seles (32), and Venus Williams (28). Like her Big Three contemporaries in the men's game, Serena set a new standard for winning after 30. All this is to say that what has transpired among Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic over the last seven years is paradigm-shifting. All three won consistently into their mid-30s, while still playing one another frequently. How has this trio been able to reverse the aging process? For starters, they were (are, in Djokovic's case) just better than everyone else. And no tennis player, man or woman, has been as obsessed with maintaining his fitness level as Djokovic; from utilizing hyperbaric chambers to his gluten-free diet, Djokovic's strict routines have allowed him to thrive into his fourth decade. And this type of commitment has been seen across other sports and activities – from Tom Brady winning Super Bowls in his 40s to Phil Mickelson winning a major at 50 to Mick Jagger still projecting maximum physical energy on stage at the age of 80. As the serve-and-volley style nears extinction, there are more grueling, all-court points on all surfaces and most players now routinely slide even on hard courts. Which is why, no matter what advances we'll continue to witness in sports science and nutrition, the mid-late 30s age may be a wall that's impossible to overcome. Federer also came heartbreakingly close to winning Wimbledon in 2019 when he was nearly 38, but he couldn't convert either of two match points on his serve. The Serb has claimed an almost unbelievable 12 grand slam titles since turning 30. But his last came at the 2023 US Open when he was … 36. Forever linked with playing some of the most incandescent tennis the sport has ever witnessed while competing against each other, for the three to all finish their Slam dominance at 36 is fitting … unless, of course, Djokovic does something about it. Djokovic has acknowledged his struggles over the last year and he admits that he's not used to being in the position of having difficulty winning consecutive matches. Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer Because once it's enough, then it's really enough and you have to put the racket aside,” he told Business Traveler this month. “And … I still don't feel it's enough for me.” From this journalist's perspective it is highly doubtful that Novak can win another major. Having just pulled out of the crucial French Open tune-up event in Rome, Djokovic will head into Roland Garros with a paucity of clay court preparation. What makes matters worse is that his world rankings has dropped to No 6, putting him in the unenviable position of potentially having to play both Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner in Paris. The long, grueling red dirt battles would be a huge physical and mental burden. Wimbledon is where Djokovic has the best chance to triumph. With the shorter points and being able to utilize his still-underrated stellar serve, Djokovic is most likely already planning to put in the fullest grass court prep possible and is probably doesn't expect to get much out of Roland Garros. There is a general consensus among the most astute followers of the sport that Djokovic will have to pull out a near miracle to win other grand slam title. But there are those who firmly believe he can. “While I understand why the skeptics are convinced that Djokovic as he closes in on the age of 38 is not going to win another major, I disagree,” Flink told me. He was not far away in Australia after beating Carlos Alcaraz to reach the semi-finals but his hamstring issue caused him to retire against Zverev. Djokovic has won two of the past four French Opens. He often thrives when people are doubting him the most.” It's a stance that Djokovic has perfected, having always been in the position of not being as openly loved as Federer and Nadal. But if Djokovic doesn't win another Slam it'll just mean that the Big Three will be forever linked with winning their last at 36, yet another tie that binds the trio for eternity.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iga Swiatek has dismissed rumours that she plans to skip this year's Wimbledon. Swiatek admitted she needed a break in the aftermath of her loss to Gauff, with later reports suggesting she could give Wimbledon a miss. Ahead of the Italian Open, Swiatek was asked whether she plans to skip Wimbledon. And she replied: “Shouldn't believe this stuff.” She added: “During the past few days I saw a million comments that were not true. There are so many theories right now I would say, especially in the Polish media about me that are not true. “I don't know, you guys like to make some articles that will attract people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ROME -- After scoring the first win of her comeback at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, Petra Kvitova was relieved -- and a little confused. "It's kind of weird that my first one came here," she said after defeating Irina-Camelia Begu 7-5, 6-1. "I've never played my best tennis here. But it feels much better than losing, that's for sure." The last time Kvitova had won consecutive matches in Rome was a decade ago, when she reached the 2015 quarterfinals. Rome: Draws | Scores | Order of play | Tournament info But despite the losses, Kvitova's comeback has been underpinned by a joy that surprised even her. "I was 95% that I would never come back," she said, recalling the last tournament before her maternity leave -- Beijing in 2023. "I had enough of tennis at that time. I was like, 'I can't do it any more,' so we decided to try for a baby. After her son, Petr, was born in July last year, the 5% of doubt grew. Kvitova had been frustrated at being unable to be active during her pregnancy, so she was eager to pick up a racquet again. "When I could do something finally after pregnancy, I played some tennis -- and it felt so good," she said. That was evident against Begu, during which Kvitova dropped serve just once. She responded by rattling off eight of the last nine games. "But even in practices my game was going up." While the shot-making still brings Kvitova joy, she sighs deeply when talking about everything else that comes with being a professional player. I was like, 'Oh my god, really, this again?'" Hotel rooms also seem suddenly small, now that Petr is beginning to crawl "everywhere" and sleeping less. Kvitova and Jiri Vanek, her husband and coach, now prefer to rent apartments, where their son has room to play with toys and where they feel at home. Kvitova refuses to set any goals or impose any sort of time limit on this stage of her career. "However long I'm going to enjoy it," she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iga Swiatek says she has already made up her mind about competing at Wimbledon this year while she also took aim at the “million comments that were not true”. Polish website Onet claimed: “As we hear unofficially, everything will depend on the results in Rome and Paris “In the event of a defeat, Swiatek may consider giving up playing on grass, there are not many points to lose here, and use this time for a longer vacation, to return to hard courts with new strength and properly prepare for the US Open. “But Team Swiatek will wait until the very end with this decision.” But Swiatek has dismissed suggestion she will not play at Wimbledon. IGA SWIATEK: “Shouldn't believe this stuff.” Q. I already saw a comment of Brad Gilbert slightly criticising that.

Casper Ruud shares reason for message to ‘devastated' Iga Swiatek and makes ‘cool' Coco Gauff confession Although Swiatek has reached the quarter-final or better in her eight tournaments so far this year, she is yet to win or title. Yeah, like coming on these clay court tournaments, I just kind of try to reflect on how I see my game and how I also saw previous seasons,” she said. “The thing is that I only remember the good stuff from last years because I was winning titles and everything. My head kind of remembers the good stuff. I'm making decisions that are not really good at the moment because I just remember how it felt previous tournaments or previous years. There's no reason to compare because we are, like, at different places in our lives, as well. “That's why I'm happy that I have my team around me to also help me to manage this stuff. Without them, for sure it wouldn't be so easy.” Iga Swiatek is in rankings trouble at the Italian Open - can she avoid a crucial drop? Our writers predict their ATP and WTA Italian Open champions. Casper Ruud: "I like to follow and see how they develop their games." Aryna Sabalenka can emulate three former world No 1s with a stellar feat if she wins in Rome.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Pole has yet to win a title on the surface and she has yet to find her st from at the Wimbledon Championships. To further illustrate her difficulties on grass, Iga Swiatek has reached the quarter-finals at the All-England Club just once. Swiatek suffered one of the worst defeats of her career at the recently concluded Madrid Open. The 23-year-old lost 1-6, 1-6 to Coco Gauff in the semi-finals, bridging her title defence to an abrupt end. Following that result, reports emerged that suggested Swiatek could skip the grass court season, including Wimbledon. But according to a post on X by the Talking Tennis podcast on Tuesday, Swiatek has since confirmed that she will not skip Wimbledon and intends to play the grass court Grand Slam which commences on June 30. Swiatek has played five times at Wimbledon throughout her career so far. The former World number one has played 16 matches in total, and won 11, giving her a win percentage of 69%, her lowest at any of the Grand Slams. Swiatek's overall grass court record consists of 24 wins and 10 defeats, and this percentage stands at 70.59%. She will hope to change that when she takes to the hallowed grass courts at SW19, and if she does lift the Venus Rosewater dish, Swiatek will become the eighth woman to win a Grand Slam on hard, clay and grass courts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sinner agreed on a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency in February and began an immediate three-month suspension after authorities accepted that the anabolic agent clostebol had entered his system via massages from his physiotherapist. "It's a very, very low expectation tournament in general for me, it's talking also results-wise," Sinner told reporters ahead of the Italian Open. That's going to come then slowly with the time of playing, after the first round match, I'm going to have a good picture of myself - where I am at." Despite missing out on three months' action, the 23-year-old was assured of retaining the top ranking for his home tournament after his closest challenger, Alexander Zverev, crashed to an early defeat in the Monte-Carlo Masters. "For me personally, good news that the Grand Slams were not included... This kind of agreement, I didn't want to do it in the beginning. "It was not easy for me to accept it because I know what really happened, but sometimes we have to choose the best in a very bad moment," Sinner said. "It's all over now, so I'm happy to play tennis again." Sinner said last year was very difficult for him. So, it was nice also to take a small break," he added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sinner is back in action in Rome this week after a three-month suspension for inadvertently ingesting a banned substance. He received a hero's welcome by his home fans when he hit the court for a practice session on Sunday, with spectators flocking to get a glimpse of the four-time grand slam champion. It might present de Minaur the perfect opportunity to grab a first career win over Sinner, with their head-to-head record currently 10-0 in the Italian's favour. Clay isn't Sinner's favourite surface, and if he shows any signs of rust it might open the door for de Minaur. He's certainly got more match practice under his belt than Sinner, who has had the wood over the Aussie their whole careers. De Minaur has only ever won the solitary set against Sinner, but that came way back in 2020. Speaking to the media on Monday, Sinner moved to lower expectations about how he'll perform in his first tournament for three months. And in extraordinary scenes, he even moved to address recent speculation about his love life. Sinner was spotted with Russian model Lara Leito by the paparazzi recently, but said in Rome: “There's a lot of attention. Also, off the court, I was surprised to see some pictures, which, nothing serious. “There was a lot of attention, both on and off the court. I was surprised to see some pictures… nothing serious, I'm not in a relationship”.#Sinner 🦊 sulla sua (non) relazione con la modella russa Lara Leito.#tennis🎾 pic.twitter.com/mlD90MlgTs Sinner previously dated Russian tennis player Anna Kalinskaya, but they ended their relationship last year. He was seen walking alongside Leito in Monte Carlo last month, and the model also attended the Monte Carlo Masters event where Sinner was practicing. Addressing his return and the difficult period surrounding his positive tests, the 23-year-old said: "Last year was very difficult. I had a lot of personal pressure, holding everything. I couldn't talk with many people about what happened. That's going to come slowly with time of playing. The World No 1 makes his return after a three-month suspension 1 in Jannik Sinner and a bevy of young talent, despite operating with far less money and less than 20 percent of America's population. The actress' look was curated by Law Roach.
