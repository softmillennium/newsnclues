                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Acting chairman Travis Hill emphasized the agency's interest in addressing stablecoin-related matters and tokenized deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is formalizing a more permissive and transparent framework for US banks engaging with crypto, including the use of public, permissionless blockchains. In remarks delivered at the American Bankers Association Washington Summit on April 8, FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill addressed the agency's evolving stance on crypto-related activities. One key area under review involves the interaction between regulated banks and public, permissionless blockchains. Hill acknowledged that while jurisdictions outside the US have permitted banks to use public chains for several years, US banking regulators have maintained a significantly more cautious posture. The FDIC now considers a total prohibition on public blockchain use too restrictive. However, Hill stressed the need for appropriate guardrails to govern such activity. The question of whether public chains can operate in a permissioned mode is also considered. According to Hill, regulators must assess how to define and supervise blockchain configurations that blur the line between open and permissioned environments. The FDIC said it intends to release additional guidance addressing specific digital asset use cases. The broader objective is to establish a consistent and transparent supervisory framework that enables innovation while ensuring adherence to safety and soundness standards. Hill recently noted that the agency's revised guidance represents a foundational shift in how to treat crypto and blockchain technologies within the US banking system. He emphasized that the FDIC rescinded its previous requirement for supervised institutions to notify the agency before engaging in digital asset and blockchain activities. Hill also addressed emerging questions surrounding stablecoins, particularly regarding legislative moves by Congress. The FDIC examines potential pass-through deposit insurance regulations updates to clarify eligibility requirements for stablecoin reserve deposits. Key issues under evaluation include liquidity risk management, safeguards against illicit finance, and cybersecurity standards. However, he raised concerns about counterparties' ability to withdraw funds at par using smart contracts after a bank failure, which could increase resolution costs if safeguards are not in place to halt such flows. This concern is driving internal FDIC efforts to assess technical solutions that could prevent unintended fund outflows during bank resolution scenarios. Hill noted that the challenge lies in aligning on-chain programmability with traditional regulatory protections designed to ensure the orderly winding down of failed institutions. The FDIC's changes mark a formal move toward regulatory clarity for banks exploring digital asset infrastructure while emphasizing the need for prudent risk controls and further definitional work around permissible activities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Its high-performance mainnet and cross-chain capabilities are key to enabling the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). The project currently focuses on practical scenarios including DeFi, IoT, and enterprise services. Originally launched as Newton, AB completed its rebranding in February 2025, marking a strategic shift from early community economy exploration toward a new phase of blockchain infrastructure evolution. Real-world assets are rapidly becoming a key narrative within the global on-chain ecosystem. In late 2024, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenized U.S. Treasury product, which has since become the largest of its kind by market capitalization. In early 2025, Circle announced the acquisition of RWA platform Hashnote and integrated it with its USDC-linked fund products, further advancing the convergence between stablecoins and real-world financial instruments. These developments reflect the accelerating global interest in on-chain RWAs. The listing of AB represents another strategic step in WEEX's commitment to blockchain infrastructure development. To mark the listing, WEEX has launched a limited-time deposit and spot trading promotion. Users who complete the designated tasks will be eligible to share in a total prize pool of 10,000 USDT. With over 1,700 trading pairs covering major and emerging tokens, the platform also launched WE-Launch to help users access quality projects early. WEEX has partnered with international figures like football star Michael Owen to boost brand visibility, and recently established a new global headquarters in Dubai to accelerate international expansion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin heads toward new lows after the White House confirms 104% tariffs against China, but traders say BTC still trades in a “fair gap zone.” MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe had earlier asserted that Bitcoin needed to retest this zone “before going back upward.” “Bitcoin attacking $80,000 is a strong sign,” said van de Poppe in another X post on April 8, adding: Fellow analyst Jelle shared similar sentiments, saying that Bitcoin's close above $79,000 on April 7 after dropping as low as $74,400 was impressive compared to how equities performed. Related: Bitcoin may rival gold as inflation hedge over next decade — Adam Back Data from onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant now shows that the long-term holders (LTHs) — individuals and entities who have held Bitcoin for more than 155 days — could be preparing to sell their coins, particularly after the latest crash. The Exchange Inflow Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric measures the volume of Bitcoin moved to exchanges, weighted by how long those coins were held dormant, indicating potential selling pressure from long-term holders. A chart posted by a CryptoQuant contributor, IT Tech, in one of its “Quicktake” blog posts showed that when the metric spiked on April 2, Bitcoin price dropped from $88,000 to $81,000. Spotting a similar spike on April 7, the analyst wondered if Bitcoin's long-term holders were “preparing to sell again?” If history repeats itself, Bitcoin's sell-off could continue for a few more days, with the March 2024 all-time high near $74,000 presenting the first line of defense.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Day ain't over yet," replied Curly. Bernstein, though, is ready to call it a day, saying bitcoin's (BTC) being down just 26% from its record high of less than three months ago shows resilience. "Bitcoin's digital gold thesis has strengthened driven by growing institutional adoption - institutional flows via ETFs and corporate treasuries," the authors wrote. Still, tariffs are bad news for the miners. They impact the mining supply chain, and this has negative implications for the U.S. bitcoin miners' hashrate, Bernstein said. The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty. Large bitcoin miners, such as Riot Platforms (RIOT), IREN (IREN), MARA Holdings (MARA) and CleanSpark (CLSK), could gain market share as they are already scaled and have artificial intelligence (AI) optionality, the report added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI cybersecurity startup Octane has emerged from stealth and announced it secured $6.75 million in a seed funding round. “Flawed blockchain code enables billions in theft across crypto, with vulnerable smart contracts creating an ever-expanding attack surface as more value enters the ecosystem,” Octane CEO Giovanni Vignone said in the release. It will soon offer code analysis for off-chain codebases as well. “Octane allows devs to battle-test their smart contract code with AI-powered security testing before it hits production on the blockchain. A growing share of chief operating officers at organizations that generate more than $1 billion in annual revenue have implemented AI-powered automated cybersecurity management systems, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report, “COOs Leverage GenAI to Reduce Data Security Losses.” This growth has been driven by COOs' demand for GenAI-driven solutions to improve cybersecurity management at a time when companies face the threat of cyberattacks that are growing more sophisticated, according to the report. In September, Torq raised $70 million in a Series C funding round to expand its AI-first cybersecurity hyperautomation solutions that automate, manage and monitor critical security operations center (SOC) responses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although XRP has yet to see a major price rally following Ripple's acquisition of Hidden Road, market sentiment remains optimistic about its potential to climb higher. On Tuesday, Ripple agreed to acquire prime brokerage firm Hidden Road for $1.25 billion. The deal now positions Ripple to act as a rare crypto-native bridge into the traditionally exclusive world of global finance, an effort that now hinges on the XRP Ledger, Ripple's stablecoin RLUSD, and growing interest in real-world asset tokenization. With this, Ripple becomes the first crypto-focused company to own a fully operational prime broker active in both traditional and digital markets. This will allow institutional clients to manage positions across both crypto and traditional instruments seamlessly. Ripple's plan includes deploying the XRP Ledger to handle portions of trade settlements. Currently, such trades can take up to 24 hours via fiat rails. Last year, Ripple partnered with UK-based Archax to launch a tokenized money market fund on XRPL. Now, with Hidden Road's client base and infrastructure, Ripple could broaden XRPL's role in tokenizing everything from bonds to commodities. Standard Chartered sees Ripple as well-positioned in this shift. The bank's latest report forecasts XRP could hit $12.50 by 2028, citing its central role in cross-border payments and expected demand for regulated digital asset solutions. XRP is currently trading near $1.93, up over 7% following the announcement. Ripple's move comes amid growing signs that regulatory conditions in the U.S. may favor tokenization and digital asset adoption. By merging crypto-native infrastructure with established capital market workflows, Ripple is not just expanding its service offering, it's laying the groundwork for a new phase in institutional finance.

The exchange said it conducted extensive due diligence, considering factors including: Although the community vote carried significant weight, Binance noted that delisting decisions are on multiple layers. The “Vote to Delist” received 103,942 total votes from 24,141 users but saw 10,262 votes disqualified by Binance for fraudulent activity, bot abuse or other methods that do not comply with BNB holding criteria. Tokens such as TROY, SNT, and UFT received the highest eligible votes across both methods but were all listed for delisting. Others expressed concerns about potential bias against BSC-based tokens — a critique that Binance has not directly addressed. A timetable for how the exchange is winding down support throughout its ecosystem has been detailed by Binance. In February 2025, AKRO, BLZ and WRX were delisted by Binance, losing over 20% within 24h. This reaction was particularly painful for BADGER and CREAM, which fell more than 15% each within hours of the news. Binance's dominant role in trading volume for many of these tokens magnifies the damage. When it is delisted on the leading stage, investor confidence disappears, in many cases permanently. The community-led (although arguably official) delisting by Binance was hailed as a step toward decentralization, but its critics now perceive it as more public relations than real change. Skeptics say popularity should not trump project fundamentals, particularly when vote manipulation is a possibility. There's also the fear that solid, but swinging, tokens may be unfairly punished. Projects may still face delisting if they fail to meet evolving standards.

The move also finalizes Sequence's pivot away from game development as it allocates more of its resources to building crypto infrastructure. “Skyweaver still has a community,” Sequence cofounder and Chief Storyteller Michael Sanders told Blockworks in an interview, noting that the game remains playable. It had also raised another $13.3 million across three prior seed funding rounds, per Crunchbase data. Sequence also said it's acquired Light, a crypto tech firm focused on tackling the Ethereum “chain abstraction” challenge. Because there are so many Ethereum L2 and even “L3” blockchains — as well as “sidechains” and other separate EVM-compatible L1 chains — it can be difficult for non-technical or new users in crypto to navigate the space without encountering hiccups, roadblocks, glitches, delays or other problems. The goal of chain abstraction is to make as much of the technical side of a multichain experience happen under the hood, so that users don't have to do things like manually bridge tokens, pay to “wrap” tokens, “sign” with a wallet frequently, or face delays when trying to complete transactions. That's the Web3 we're building—fast, accessible, and seamlessly interoperable,” said Light founder Shun Kakinoki in a statement. Sequence provides infrastructure for some of the biggest players in the crypto gaming space, typically offering those services as “white-label.” That means you don't see their name on a product that they provided to another brand. For instance, crypto gaming platform Immutable uses Sequence's embedded wallets. Sequence also counts Ubisoft, Polygon, SKALE, Avalanche and Base among its clients. The firm has its own indexer so game devs can assess activity across multiple chains. Permissionless IV serves as the definitive gathering for crypto's technical founders, developers, and builders to come together and create the future.If you're ready to shape the future of crypto, Permissionless IV is where it happens. Utilizing a ‘DeFi Mullet' approach, Coinbase's Bitcoin-backed loans integration with Morpho demonstrates a powerful blueprint for CEXs to monetize dormant assets by expanding adoption of wrapped products (cbBTC, USDC) while also supporting native and/or preferred DeFi ecosystems (Base) which can further lead to downstream growth in onchain liquidity and increased utilization of the related assets. Scott Stornetta expressed admiration for Bitcoin's achievements and criticism of its perceived limitations BTC's price went down, but institutions were buying the dip at “astounding” levels Markets recoiled on Trump's tariff talk, and crypto's resilience was short-lived Over 70 public companies already hold bitcoin, including Tesla and Block, though for some major tech stocks, this pivot might be easier than others… Our research packs a punch and gives you actionable takeaways for each topic.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>XRP could surge to $12.5 and overtake Ethereum as the second-largest crypto asset by market cap before Trump's second term wraps up, according to a new report by Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered's global head of digital assets research. With XRP now trading at $1.9 according to CoinGecko data, reaching $12.5 would represent a surge of over 550%. “By the end of 2028, we see XRP's market cap overtaking Ethereum's,” Kendrick noted. XRP's market cap is over $110 billion per CoinGecko, positioning it as the fourth-largest crypto asset. XRP's market cap previously peaked at $190 billion in January, and it has also, at times, surpassed Tether to claim the third-ranking spot. Kendrick's forecast is based on several factors, including expected regulatory developments and institutional adoption. Prior to Ripple, the agency had already withdrawn from several high-profile crypto enforcement cases. Kendrick also forecasts SEC approval for spot XRP ETFs in the third quarter of 2025, which he estimates could attract $4-8 billion in inflows within the first year. This projection falls in line with JPMorgan's estimate. The bank, in its January analysis, also anticipated first-year inflows for potential XRP spot ETFs to be in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion. JPMorgan's forecast was based on the market penetration rates observed with existing Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Ripple's CEO previously predicted XRP ETFs would make their market debut in the second half of 2025. Regarding XRP's use case in payments, Kendrick believes its cross-border payment functionality aligns with growing digital asset usage trends, similar to stablecoins, which he notes have seen 50% annual transaction volume growth and are projected to increase tenfold over four years. In support of this view, the analyst compares XRPL to Stellar, a blockchain with comparable architecture that has achieved success in tokenization. Franklin Templeton initially launched its OnChain US Government Money Fund on Stellar. Even though the analyst is bullish on XRP, he does not ignore existing challenges the project faces, including a smaller developer ecosystem than its competitors and a low fee model. The analyst continues to see strong potential in Bitcoin and Avalanche, but he's less enthusiastic about Ether, labeling it an “identified loser.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We were still in the thick of COVID-19 caution but slowly coming out of quarantine when TikTok and Tiger King monopolized the collective consciousness. An artist named Beeple sits in his living room surrounded by loved ones as they all stare at his TV in disbelief. Beeple's newly created NFT has sold for $69 million. This digital artwork, which is still in the infancy stage of popularity, has officially made Beeple the third highest-selling artist of all time. But what exactly is an NFT, and why are people spending thousands, if not millions, of dollars on art that can literally be saved on a computer for free? Bruckman does a great job of getting into the minds of these digital pioneers whose lives have changed forever by selling their art on the blockchain. After Beeple's historic sale ignited an all-out frenzy, many artists found themselves living out their own rags-to-riches stories. But all good things must come to an end. Minted goes into stunning detail about the conspiracy theories, celebrity endorsements, and dark side of this controversial new frontier. Watching this film in hindsight, as the stock market is currently volatile, gives off an eerily uneasy feeling. Nicholas Bruckman could have never predicted the timing of this release to perfectly align with cultural events but it works so well in tandem. This larger philosophical question is juxtaposed against composer Dan Deacon's bright and forceful score. Minted hypothesizes that they may not be raking in millions of dollars like they used to, but there is still a market for them. However, what has died are people's hopes and dreams that this was sustainable. Minted made its World Premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival and is coming to Netflix on April 9th.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PARIS, April  08, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Paris Blockchain Week (PBW) 2025 officially opened today at the Carrousel du Louvre, drawing global attention as Europe's most influential gathering for blockchain and Web3 innovation. As an official sponsor, BYDFi marked its fifth anniversary with a major reveal—debuting its brand-new on-chain trading platform, MoonX, for the first time on an international stage. The timing couldn't have been more fitting: MoonX's unveiling aligned perfectly with BYDFi's five-year milestone, adding an extra layer of significance to the launch. To celebrate its anniversary and kick off PBW with energy, BYDFi launched its “Crypto Travel Challenge”—a hybrid online-offline campaign inspired by the brand's five-year journey. On site, attendees scanned QR codes at the booth to complete missions and claim exclusive “Crypto Voyager Backpacks” and limited-edition BYDFi merch. Meanwhile, online participants joined from around the world by following BYDFi's official X account (@BYDFi_Official), reposting the challenge, and tagging #BYDFiPBW2025 to enter giveaways. Throughout the day, BYDFi's booth welcomed a steady stream of crypto professionals, investors, and curious newcomers. Visitors demoed MoonX, engaged in real-time conversations about the MemeCoin market, and explored the next phase of on-chain trading. Nearby, a crypto-themed coffee bar added a relaxed touch, reinforcing BYDFi's mission to bring warmth and personality to the digital finance space. The Paris Blockchain Week journey has only just begun. Founded in 2020, BYDFi is one of Forbes' Top 10 Global Crypto Exchanges, serving over 1,000,000 users worldwide. The platform holds multi-national MSB licenses, is a member of Korea's CODE VASP Alliance, and leads the industry in compliance and transparency with a 1:1 asset reserve policy and regular Proof of Reserve reports.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“That will make XRP the second-largest non-stablecoin digital asset,” wrote Kendrick in a Tuesday note. Thus, XRP joins a group of cryptocurrencies that Standard Chartered expects to be the market's big winners. Other members of that group include Bitcoin and Avalanche, while Ethereum is expected to be one of the losers. The hype has been fuelled by US President Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance and the Securities and Exchange Commission having dropped its case against Ripple. Ripple says tokenisation will be a $19 trillion business by 2033. Today, the firm still engages the XRPL developer community and provides it with tools, services, and infrastructure support. Polymarket bettors give spot XRP ETFs a 77% chance of being approved in 2025. Kendrick said he expected XRP ETFs to be approved between July and September. He also estimated that those funds will generate between $4 billion and $8 billion in the first 12 months, echoing JPMorgan, which has made a similar estimate. Ripple also recently announced a large deal with the United Arab Emirates, that will see its technology used in the Dubai International Financial Centre, itself the host of many crypto firms. To be sure, XRP's price has dropped about 12% in the past week and punters on crypto-betting platform Polymarket bet it's going to fall even more this month. Trump's so-called “psychodrama” trade policies that have slammed some of the US' closest trading partners, its rivals and even a bunch of penguins with fresh tariffs. Even so, Kendrick argued that XRP and other cryptocurrencies will come out of the mess stronger than ever. “Keep looking for winners and HODLing those you already own,” Kendrick said. “Tariff mess will be over soon, and Bitcoin's solid performance during the noise tells us a leg higher for the asset class will follow.” Andrew Flanagan is a markets correspondent for DL News.</p>

It's no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $250 million in art — this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%. There were 17 charges, including things like tax fraud, falsifying business records, and conspiracy. Guilty verdicts on all counts were handed down just two weeks after Trump's father, Donald Trump, announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election. According to the lawsuit, Capital One was acting on "unsubstantiated ‘woke' beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political views" rather than any legal precedent. Eric Trump told CNBC that after "falling in love with the cryptocurrency industry and realizing that "every sophisticated country is using their excess power to mine Bitcoin," he concluded that launching his own coin would be the best way to push back against an economy that has "launched a war on [cryptocurrencies]." Eric also claimed that, despite his father being back in the White House, there is no conflict of interest with this new venture as he "[doesn't] have anything to do with government and... frankly, doesn't want anything to do with government." "You better believe that China is running very hard at this. We better win the crypto race," he told CNBC. Here's what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.

Now, with with some 1,000 restaurants signed up, CEO Ben Leventhal said Blackbird plans to use the money to launch its newest product, a cross-restaurant “points” service it's calling Blackbird Club, as well as to expand into more markets outside of New York (its headquarters), San Francisco, and Charleston, South Carolina. “Charleston punches above its class,” Leventhal said in an interview with TechCrunch. Spark Capital, a new backer, is leading this latest round, with participation also from Coinbase Ventures, Amex Ventures, and Andreessen Horowitz — three investors that backed Blackbird in its $24 million Series A in 2023. Amex acquired Resy, a reservations platform that Leventhal previously founded, in 2019. The two companies — Resy and Blackbird — are not integrating now, but “it's fair to say we will,” Leventhal said. No plans on how or if that'll lead to a partnership deal. Blackbird describes its Flynet payment service as a layer-three transaction protocol built on Coinbase's Base. Diners can use it to pay for meals at the table via Blackbird's app, as well as to redeem loyalty points when they visit restaurants. It's worth asking whether blockchain was strictly a necessary part of the mix. There are plenty of other loyalty and payment programs in the market, including a number that are direct competitors to Blackbird, like Punchh, Toast, and Lightspeed, built on more conventional financial structures. “I don't think it necessarily ‘has to be built on blockchain,'” Leventhal said. But Leventhal pointed out, too, that “there are a few things that we do believe that over time will be important opportunities, and those opportunities will be based on being on-chain.” These include how Blackbird and restaurants hold customer profiles and activity, he said. While platforms like Instagram and TikTok have turned the world into armchair foodies, producing legions of people who virally flock to the latest and coolest cafe, they are doing this amid a time of rapidly declining margins and heightened price sensitivity. “The restaurant industry is made up of millions of local, small business owners around the world,” Arianna Simpson, a general partner at a16z, told TechCrunch over email. Simpson believes this is specifically where blockchain can play a role: improving that margin structure. Ingrid is a writer and editor for TechCrunch, joining February 2012, based out of London.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin has swung wildly over the last week as traders scramble to get ahead of a “crisis scenario” for the bitcoin price. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" Now, as Wall Street giants stare down the barrel of an “existential" bitcoin and crypto game-changer, Michael Saylor's software company-turned-bitcoin buyer Strategy has warned it could be forced to sell some of its bitcoin to meet its financial obligations. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “As bitcoin constitutes the vast bulk of assets on our balance sheet, if we are unable to secure equity or debt financing in a timely manner, on favorable terms, or at all, we may be required to sell bitcoin to satisfy our financial obligations, and we may be required to make such sales at prices below our cost basis or that are otherwise unfavorable," a Strategy regulatory filing read. Strategy said it's expecting to record a near-$6 billion unrealized loss for the first quarter, despite a related $1.69 billion income tax benefit, and warned it might not be able to regain profitability in future quarters, especially if the value of its bitcoin continues to plummet. Strategy's stock price has almost halved since soaring to its November peak that saw it inducted into the prestigious Nasdaq 100 index. At the end of March, Strategy held around $8 billion worth of debt on which it owes about $35 million per year in interest on top of almost $150 million it must pay every year in dividends on its stock. Meanwhile, crypto analysts are desperately trying to predict where the market is headed next, with one closely-watched analyst issuing a bitcoin price prediction that would see bitcoin crash back to around $10,000. “Everyone's in for the long-term, as long as it's going up," Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone, wrote in a report posted to X.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With AI, the multichain AI-powered NFT platform, has announced that it has also integrated the crypto XRP. Now, users can create and transfer their NFTs on XRP Ledger more efficiently, benefiting from real-time Artificial Intelligence that automates metadata management and contract logic. The AI-powered multichain NFT platform, Colle AI, seems to have also integrated the crypto XRP into its ecosystem. In practice, from now on, users can create and transfer NFTs on the XRP Ledger more efficiently, thanks to real-time AI support that automates metadata management and contract logic. In fact, Colle AI is precisely focused on leveraging Artificial Intelligence to simplify the process of creating NFTs, allowing artists and creators to easily transform their ideas into digital assets. Not only, the expansion of XRP support includes improved routing algorithms, optimized gas estimation, and updated compatibility with the smart contract engine powered by Colle AI. In fact, XRP joins the blockchains of Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana and Bitcoin. Regarding Solana, Colle AI recently announced that it has expanded its strategy to strengthen AI tools and liquidity. “Colle AI amplifies its Solana strategy to strengthen AI tools and liquidity, driving next-generation multichain NFT performance and seamless scalability across the #Web3 ecosystem” In any case, the broader infrastructural goals of Colle AI are to simplify the creation of multichain through intelligent tools and ensure that NFTs move freely and securely across ecosystems. Beyond AI and NFT, Ripple today made headlines also for the report created with Boston Consulting Group (BCG), regarding tokenization. Specifically, the report predicts that by 2033, the market for tokenized assets will grow from 0.6 trillion dollars to 18.9 trillion dollars, with a CAGR of 53%. This growth will occur in three phases: 1) low-risk adoption, 2) institutional expansion, and 3) market transformation, with tokenization being incorporated into financial and non-financial products.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From scalable blockchain layers to AI integration and cross-chain platforms, the digital asset space is stacking real-world value. Leading that charge is Qubetics ($TICS), a presale powerhouse that's doing what few others even attempt—fixing blockchain fragmentation through real-world interoperability. While others race to patch things together with middleware, Qubetics is laying a smooth, unified foundation that works across chains, apps, and borders. If the goal is to stack smart ahead of the bull run, these are the best altcoins to buy for next bull run—each one packing substance, scalability, and staying power. None of them play nice with each other. Qubetics steps in with a clean, modular framework that actually makes cross-chain activity feel seamless—for users, devs, and businesses alike. Let's say Vanessa runs a small gaming studio in Seattle. With just one dashboard, she can sync assets, manage contracts, and trigger cross-chain actions—without ever leaving the app. Qubetics allows him to initiate those transactions in one currency and settle in another, all on-chain, all instant, without sweating about network bridges or gas fees across different blockchains. Think of it like being able to move money and assets across blockchains as easily as switching tabs in a browser. It just added native support for SEI and SUI networks, expanding its bridge ecosystem and routing capabilities across even more high-throughput chains. The platform also rolled out QubeFlow, a backend API system that lets businesses plug interoperability into their apps without needing a dev army. Developer engagement is rising, especially from DeFi startups and fintech builders who want flexibility without fragmentation. That surge in traction is reflected in growing GitHub commits, wallet activations, and pilot partnerships with logistics and gaming platforms across North America. The Qubetics crypto presale is now in Stage 29 and has already pulled in 506 million tokens sold across 24,400+ holders, raising $15.9 million. At just $0.1573 per $TICS token, the runway is wide open. Those numbers aren't fantasy—they're based on platform adoption, token demand, and the unique value Qubetics brings to a fragmented crypto world. Qubetics is solving one of the biggest pain points in crypto—interoperability—and doing it with elegance and scale. With a packed presale, working apps, and cross-chain power, $TICS is without question one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run. So is the demand for high-performance GPU rendering. Enter Render—a decentralized platform that connects content creators with idle GPUs for rendering 3D content, AI workloads, and metaverse assets. Artists and developers get the compute they need. GPU owners earn RNDR tokens by renting their rigs. And with content creators shifting into virtual production, gaming, and interactive experiences, Render's utility is going off the charts. Render integrated with several top-tier AI labs and is now powering generative content workflows for indie studios and enterprise media houses. It also launched tools for Blender, Unreal Engine, and Unity—cutting out the usual red tape and bringing Render tech into mainstream creative tools. That's opened the door to thousands of new users across animation, architecture, and entertainment. GPU farms and AI labs are exploring ways to monetize unused compute, and Render is one of the few platforms making that economically viable. Render is solving a real bottleneck in the AI and creative space—affordable, scalable rendering. With rising adoption and mainstream integrations, it's easily one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run. SUI is a high-speed layer-1 blockchain built from scratch using the Move programming language. That means transactions don't wait in line—they're processed simultaneously, drastically boosting performance and lowering latency. In early 2025, SUI faced sell pressure after a major token unlock. Because usage was up, apps kept shipping, and the dev community doubled down. The chain is now handling millions of daily transactions, most of them tied to gaming and DeFi protocols. It also launched new zero-knowledge toolkits for privacy-focused applications. And while other networks slow down or choke during high usage, SUI keeps humming. SUI has the right tech stack for real-world use—especially in high-frequency applications. With scalability, dev support, and speed baked in, it's a top pick among the best altcoins to buy for next bull run. SEI is carving out its niche as the blockchain for trading dApps. With its native order-matching engine, sub-second finality, and ultra-low latency, SEI is basically tailor-made for exchanges, order books, and algorithmic traders. In Q1 2025, SEI's ecosystem exploded with DEXs, perps platforms, and trading tools all launching with native SEI support. The chain recently added new tooling for TradFi-style compliance, drawing attention from serious fintechs. And integrations with major analytics and custody platforms mean SEI is becoming more than just fast—it's becoming reliable. With unmatched speed and growing adoption, it earns its place among the best altcoins to buy for next bull run. EOS fell off the radar for a while—but now it's roaring back. The network launched EOS EVM, a high-speed Ethereum-compatible chain built to finally bring dApps to EOS without sacrificing speed or composability. It also got new leadership and a dev reboot through the EOS Network Foundation. The vibe has shifted from “rugged potential” to “refocused power.” Thanks to EVM compatibility, DeFi protocols from Ethereum and BNB Chain are now bridging into EOS with ease. That's sparked a fresh wave of liquidity pools, lending markets, and NFT protocols launching on EOS. New grant programs are rewarding developers, and updated documentation has lowered the barrier to entry for smaller teams and indie projects. EOS is rebuilding from the ground up, with better tech and stronger leadership. As DeFi and NFTs expand, its renewed momentum makes it one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run—especially at its current undervalued range. The next bull run won't either. While others chase hype, these five altcoins are building like the market's already flipped. Qubetics is laying the foundation for a fully interoperable future. Render is powering the AI and metaverse engine room. SUI is all about speed and scale. For anyone looking to front-run the next breakout moment, these are the best altcoins to buy for next bull run—built on code, community, and crazy potential. Qubetics already has functional cross-chain products and is solving real issues in blockchain interoperability, especially for businesses and dApps. SUI enables parallel transaction execution, making it ideal for high-speed, high-traffic apps like gaming and DeFi. SEI is tailored for trading, with a native matching engine, near-instant finality, and architecture designed for financial apps. Yes—new leadership, EVM compatibility, and a wave of new dApps have reignited EOS's ecosystem. Disclaimer: This content is provided by a sponsor.
