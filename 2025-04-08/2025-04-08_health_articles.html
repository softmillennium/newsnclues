                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals with a case fatality rate of up to 40%. There are currently no approved vaccines against the virus. Historically GP38 has been considered an important target for vaccines or other treatments. However, the lack of knowledge regarding GP38s function during infection has hindered efforts to develop CCHFV-specific medical countermeasures. The new research sheds light on GP38's role in viral infections and pathogenesis, and how GP38-specific antibodies particularly mediate protection in vivo. This study is focused on demonstrating that GP38 alone can act as a 'viral toxin' and trigger vascular leakage to occur. It is also focused largely on understanding the mechanism of protective efficacy for antibodies targeting GP38." Andrew Herbert, senior author of the study and USAMRIID branch chief Evidence also shows that GP38 has a direct role in viral pathogenesis that is independent of its function in viral glycoprotein biogenesis. It emphasizes the importance of including GP38 in CCHFV vaccine design and provides a starting point for the rational design of GP38-targeting anti-CCHF therapeutics. Additional research backs this evidence by treating CCHFV-challenged mice with exogenous GP38, further enhancing vascular leak in the context of infection, suggesting that GP38 functions as a secreted viral toxin in the induction of vascular leak. "By determining a mechanism of action for protective GP38-specific monoclonal antibody therapies, we can better understand how to target this protein for the development of potent medical countermeasures." This recent publication showed that non-neutralizing GP38-specific mAbs targeting the N-terminal region of GP38 (region 2) were the most protective against lethal challenge, the most potent at reducing circulating GP38, diminishing vascular leak, and curtailing viral dissemination to distal tissues. The moderate effect of the virus-neutralizing anti-Gc mAb indicates that the observed reduction in vascular leak upon treatment with GP38-binding mAbs is not only a result of overall reduction in viral load but rather is specific to a reduction in circulating GP38 and direct blockade of the function of GP38 in inducing vascular leak. "Virus host interactions are very complex and teasing apart complex processes that occur during a viral infection can be tricky," says Herbert. "Viral proteins often perform more than one function during infection, and they can also 'collaborate' with other viral proteins, or even host proteins, to perform a specific function that is beneficial for the virus." This study is part of the Prepositioning Optimized Strategies for Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics Against Diverse Emerging Infectious Threats - PROVIDENT consortium. Antibodies targeting Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus GP38 limit vascular leak and viral spread.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research from the University of Sydney reveals that the number of Australians living with diabetes may be up to 35 percent higher than previously estimated. The study, published in Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice, applied a sophisticated algorithm to integrated health data from Medicare, hospital records, and pharmaceutical claims. The results suggest there could be more than two million Australians living with diabetes, many of whom are currently missing from the official diabetes register. “A significant number of Australians are missing from national statistics. That makes it harder to plan services, allocate funding, and deliver prevention strategies where they're most needed.” The research was partially funded in 2017 by a Diabetes Australia Research Trust grant and builds on longstanding calls for better integration of medical data to understand the true burden of chronic disease. Professor Grant Brinkworth, Director of Research at Diabetes Australia, said the findings offer a compelling call to action. This study tells us what many of us in the sector have said for years: we're not seeing the full picture of diabetes in Australia,” The study also found that many people who are living with diabetes are managing the condition through lifestyle changes or medications like metformin, groups who may be less likely to register with the National Diabetes Services Scheme (NDSS). “If people aren't visible in the data, they're also invisible to policy and funding decisions,” Professor Brinkworth added. The research reinforces the importance of improved screening, earlier diagnosis, and greater health system integration to ensure every person affected by diabetes is counted, supported, and resourced.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, a global leader in laboratory automation and innovation, introduces the Next-Generation Basophil Activation Test (BAT) for research use only to more effectively characterize food allergies without exposure to potentially harmful allergens. Approximately 220 million people globally suffer from at least one food allergy. Most food allergies and treatment efficacies are currently determined through a dated and rigorous Oral Food Challenge (OFC), exposing a patient to gradual amounts of foods to determine if they have a reaction, which could include anaphylaxis in some situations. The new BAT test eliminates that risk, testing for multiple allergens at once through a blood draw -- saving hours of food testing and exposure to potentially harmful reactions. This offers a groundbreaking alternative in allergy testing, removing patient obstacles and reducing ethical concerns associated with direct allergen exposure in vulnerable participants,” Jean-Marc Busnel, PhD, Principal Investigator and Senior Staff Research Scientist, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences “For too long these concerns have limited critical advancements, putting people at risk of not having access to life-saving treatment options should an allergic reaction occur. By removing these barriers, this test unlocks an opportunity to finally expand food allergy drug development and research. This reinforces our mission at Beckman Coulter Life Sciences to deliver tools that empower clinicians and improve patient outcomes.” The innovation follows the FARE (Food Allergy Research and Education) Innovation Award Diagnostic Challenge which Beckman Coulter Life Sciences received in 2022. “At FARE, we have prioritized supporting the development of safer alternatives to oral food challenges that can expose patients to risk and induce anxiety,” said Sung Poblete, PhD, RN, CEO of FARE. BAT are functional assays measuring basophil activation in response to specific allergens or other stimuli. By leveraging dry technology to overcome traditional BAT challenges, standardization is enabled with conjugated antibodies and allergens pre-mixed and dried down together in a single tube with only 4 pipetting steps. Negative and positive controls can also be included, all without the need for compensation or centrifugation, and is compatible with any flow cytometer. While BAT has been around for more than 30 years and provides valuable insights in the study of allergies, its adoption has been limited due to the perceived complexity and lack of reproducibility associated with the assay. The use of dry reagents can support overcoming those challenges. The test offers unmatched flexibility with customizable dried down allergens, antibodies, and concentrations available through Custom Design Service from Beckman Coulter Life Sciences.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study by the University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Finland, found that a significant proportion of Parkinson's disease diagnoses are later corrected. Up to one in six diagnoses changed after ten years of follow-up, and the majority of new diagnoses were made within two years of the original diagnosis. A recent study published in Neurology reveals significant diagnostic instability in Parkinson's disease, with 13.3% of diagnoses revised over a 10-year follow-up period. When dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is treated as a separate diagnostic category, the revision rate increases to 17.7%. The large-scale study followed over 1,600 patients initially diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Notably, a majority of these diagnostic changes occur within the first two years of diagnosis, which emphasises the challenges and uncertainty clinicians face in diagnosing Parkinson's disease accurately." While dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging was frequently used to aid in diagnosis, the study found that postmortem neuropathological examinations were only conducted in 3% of deceased patients, with 64% of these confirming the initial Parkinson's disease diagnoses. "This rule, which considers the temporal sequence of motor and cognitive symptoms, resulted in more latter cases identified compared to the original clinical diagnoses. While the one-year rule is used in clinical practice, its relevance may be limited by the overlap between these disorders, with substantial group-level differences but minimal distinctions at the individual level," says Kaasinen. "The key conclusions of our study are the urgent need for ongoing refinement of diagnostic processes, enhanced clinical training for neurologists, more frequent use of postmortem diagnostic confirmation, and the development of widely accessible, cost-effective biomarkers," Kaasinen summarises. Increasing the rate of autopsies would enhance clinicians' understanding of diagnostic accuracy, particularly in cases where initial diagnoses are unclear or revised. The development of cost-effective and accessible biomarkers could improve diagnostic precision, particularly in non-specialised settings, ultimately leading to better patient care. This retrospective study was conducted at Turku University Hospital and three regional hospitals in Finland, analysing patient records from 2006 to 2020. The study aimed to evaluate the long-term diagnostic stability of Parkinson's disease and assess the accuracy of initial diagnoses over time in a large cohort of patients diagnosed by neurologists, with or without specialisation in movement disorders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Poor dietary habits in adolescence – lots of sweets, sugary drinks or skipping breakfast – is directly linked to overusing social media, University of Queensland research has found. Associate Professor Asaduzzaman Khan from UQ's School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences led a team that analyzed data from the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children survey involving 222,865 adolescents from 41 countries. This is the first multi-national study to offer insights into how social media behaviours are linked to adolescents' dietary choices. Dr. Asaduzzaman Khan, Associate Professor, UQ's School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences The study examined social media use that was defined as excessive (frequent or extended use), or problematic (mirroring addiction-like symptoms with compulsive and uncontrollable behaviour). Dr. Khan said the findings reinforced the importance of reducing problematic and excessive social media use to help stop poor dietary habits. "These poor dietary habits are potential risk factors for obesity, weakened immune system, mental well-being, and chronic conditions including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular issues later in life," he said. "Issues like cyberbullying, body shaming and negative body image are beyond the scope of this particular work, but we know from other research that overuse of social media certainly affects psychosocial health, academic performance, interpersonal and family relationships. "The challenge is how, as a family, as a community, we are going to deal with it, so we are using the technology without letting our kids harm themselves. "We cannot simply live our life without social media or without screens but there is a need for education in the community.'' The research also analyzed fruit and vegetable consumption, finding problematic social media use was associated with a lower fruit and vegetable intake, with adolescents in this category possibly engaging in mindless eating of unhealthy snacks while scrolling, with limited time for meal preparation. Conversely, excessive use was linked to a higher intake of fruit and vegetables that may be due to the influence of health-conscious influencers, nutritionists, and fitness enthusiasts, the study reported. Dr Khan said adolescence offered a unique opportunity to develop and promote healthy dietary habits. "This is a period characterised by autonomy in eating behaviours and establishment of new personal habits,'' he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Australian technology is set to transform the way that gastrointestinal cancers are detected and treated with precise, minimally invasive surgery. Backed by the Federal Government's Economic Accelerator (AEA) Ignite Grant, researchers from the University of South Australia (UniSA) are using quantum technology to develop a first-of-its-kind laparoscopic probe that will allow surgeons to accurately map the spread of tumours. Led by Dr. Nicole Dmochowska from UniSA's Future Industries Institute, the $405,050 project is being undertaken in partnership with precision cancer surgery company Ferronova. The probe will work alongside Ferronova's iron-oxide nanoparticle formulation (FerroTrace) to improve the detection of cancerous lymph nodes during surgery, reducing the need for extensive procedures that often lead to life-threatening complications and life-long side-effects for survivors. By integrating state-of-the-art quantum sensors into a minimally invasive laparoscopic probe, we aim to give surgeons a powerful new tool to precisely locate affected lymph nodes. This will potentially enable more targeted surgery, reducing the need for extensive tissue removal and improving post-surgical recovery." This new project will take this technology further by miniaturising the probe for use in laparoscopic – or keyhole – surgery, allowing for more precise and less invasive cancer treatments. Researchers have spent more than eight years developing the magnetometer probes for cancer surgery. The AEA Ignite grant will fund the next crucial step: developing a fully functional, preclinically validated prototype that can be trialled in large animal models before progressing to human clinical trials. "This research aligns with Australia's national priority areas in both medical science and quantum technology," according to UniSA researcher Professor Benjamin Thierry. "The commercial potential is immense, with an anticipated global market exceeding $2 billion annually," Prof Thierry says. "This technology is particularly promising for patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy before surgery, where conventional lymphatic mapping methods have limited effectiveness," Dr Cousins says. Preclinical trials are expected to start within the next year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Drug-resistant infections - especially from deadly bacteria like tuberculosis and staph - are a growing global health crisis. These infections are harder to treat, often require more expensive or toxic medications and are responsible for longer hospital stays and higher mortality rates. Now, Tulane University scientists have developed a new artificial intelligence-based method that more accurately detects genetic markers of antibiotic resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus - potentially leading to faster and more effective treatments. A Tulane study, published in Nature Communications, introduces a new Group Association Model (GAM) that uses machine learning to identify genetic mutations tied to drug resistance. Unlike traditional tools, which can mistakenly link unrelated mutations to resistance, GAM doesn't rely on prior knowledge of resistance mechanisms, making it more flexible and able to find previously unknown genetic changes. Current methods of detecting resistance used by organizations such as the WHO either take too long - like culture-based testing - or miss rare mutations, as with some DNA-based tests. Tulane's model addresses both problems by analyzing whole genome sequences and comparing groups of bacterial strains with different resistance patterns to find genetic changes that reliably indicate resistance to specific drugs. Tony Hu, PhD, Senior Author, Weatherhead Presidential Chair in Biotechnology Innovation and director of the Tulane Center for Cellular & Molecular Diagnostics In the study, the researchers applied GAM to over 7,000 strains of Mtb and nearly 4,000 strains of S. aureus, identifying key mutations linked to resistance. They found that GAM not only matched or exceeded the accuracy of the WHO's resistance database but also drastically reduced false positives, wrongly identified markers of resistance which can lead to inappropriate treatment. "Current genetic tests might wrongly classify bacteria as resistant, affecting patient care," said lead author Julian Saliba, a graduate student in the Tulane University Center for Cellular and Molecular Diagnostics. "Our method provides a clearer picture of which mutations actually cause resistance, reducing misdiagnoses and unnecessary changes to treatment." In validation studies using clinical samples from China, the machine-learning enhanced model outperformed WHO-based methods in predicting resistance to key front-line antibiotics. This is significant because catching resistance early can help doctors tailor the right treatment regimen before the infection spreads or worsens. The model's ability to detect resistance without needing expert-defined rules also means it could potentially be applied to other bacteria or even in agriculture, where antibiotic resistance is also a concern in crops. "It's vital that we stay ahead of ever-evolving drug-resistant infections," Saliba said. Enhanced diagnosis of multi-drug-resistant microbes using group association modeling and machine learning.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A UPV/EHU study published in the prestigious journal Stem Cell Research & Therapy has proven that stem cells extracted from human dental pulp can be transformed into excitable neuronal cells and has highlighted the potential of these easily accessible cells for nerve tissue engineering. This finding will enable the furthering of advances in cell therapy for treating various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's disease and epilepsy. "An adult neuron cannot be divided. And unlike other organs, the brain has a comparatively low capacity for natural regeneration due to its low presence of stem cells," said Gaskon Ibarretxe, a researcher in the UPV/EHU's Signaling Lab research group. The scientific community is looking for a way to obtain functional neurons that can be transplanted to restore impairments in neurodegenerative pathologies, brain lesions, strokes, etc. The UPV/EHU research group has obtained cells very similar to neurons; they "manage to produce electrical impulses like those of neurons by means of the differentiation of stem cells in human dental pulp, the soft tissue located inside the tooth," they said. The main milestone of this study was "the obtaining of cells that display functional excitability and which synthesise a type of neurotransmitter that regulates neuronal activity, without having been genetically modified; the primary dental cells were simply cultured with differentiation factors and were subjected to precise stimuli to generate cells with neuronal electrophysiological activity", said the researchers of the Signaling Lab at the UPV/EHU. Neurotransmitters are substances released by neurons that can send excitatory or inhibitory signals to make neurons generate an electrical impulse or not. "The cells that we managed to differentiate are capable of synthesising a neurotransmitter known as GABA," explained the researchers. And that is very important because there are neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease or conditions such as epilepsy in which there is a selective death of those types of cells in specific areas of the brain, and a resulting hyper-excitability of the brain circuitry". Ibarretxe and Pineda, lecturers in the UPV/EHU's Department of Cell Biology and Histology, expressed great optimism when referring to the new avenues that can be explored on the basis of this finding: "We believe that these cells could be integrated into a damaged brain circuit and replace lost neurons, and thus reconnect with existing neurons and eventually regenerate the entire lost area functionally. This finding suggests a different approach to traditional cell therapy applied to the nervous system, which until now has been based, above all, on reducing inflammation, on neuroprotecting what remained alive, but not on replacing what has been lost. This opens a new door to the future of personalised medicine." That is in fact the next step in this research: "to transplant these cells into living animals and see if they are integrated into the brain circuit and reconnect with the host's neurons. We obtained cells that generate electrical impulses characteristic of neurons that are not yet fully mature, but we are aware that they must generate trains of electrical impulses and be correctly integrated into a neuronal circuit. The UPV/EHU researchers admitted that "there is a long road ahead, but we know it's going to be very promising. We believe that these cells have a great chance of being implemented in the clinical setting. The fact that they are transplanted at a relatively immature stage could even encourage their plasticity and integration into already developed brain circuits". The researchers added that these cells in fact offer an inherent advantage: "They are cells that do not have a tendency to generate tumours; on the contrary, it has been proven that they are very stable cells and differentiate better than other types of human stem cells into neurons," they concluded.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>About 65% of melanoma patients do not respond to immunotherapy. New work by the team of Prof. Max Mazzone (VIB-KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology) discovered that an enzyme called HPGDS (expressed in a specific subset of macrophages), plays a key role in immunotherapy resistance. Blocking HPGDS may be a new way to overcome immunotherapy resistance in melanoma patients and potentially in other tumors facing similar challenges. However, approximately 65% of melanoma patients still do not respond to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. The immunosuppression induced by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) may be pivotal in this process. TAMs have been shown to impede immune system function, thereby fostering tumor growth and metastasis dissemination. Thus, reprogramming TAM phenotype away from their immunosuppressive state might boost cancer treatments. New work by the team of Prof. Max Mazzone (VIB-KU Leuven) and colleagues zooms in on a specific enzyme known as hematopoietic prostaglandin D2 synthase (HPGDS), which is produced by TAMs. HPGDS promotes the formation of a metabolite called prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), which, in turn, helps cancer cells to resist treatment by blocking the activity of T-cells, which are vital for attacking tumors. By analyzing the expression of genes related to the immune response in patients who responded to immune checkpoint blockade therapies compared to those who did not, we found that HPGDS levels were high in non-responding patients during treatment, whereas were downregulated if the treatment was working and T-cells were then activated against the tumor." By employing genetic deletion of HPGDS in macrophages and using pharmacological inhibitors in mouse and humanized models, the researchers proved a remarkable shift in the macrophages' behavior from promoting tumor growth to supporting a more robust and anti-tumoral immune response. "Targeting HPGDS not only enhanced the recruitment and activation of T-cells per se," says Prof. Max Mazzone, "but also showed promise in overcoming resistance to existing therapies. Our findings suggest that blocking HPGDS or the two downstream receptors may be a new potential strategy for improving treatment options for melanoma patients and perhaps others facing similar challenges." This study suggests that HPGDS inhibitors or PGD2 receptor blockers could serve as new therapeutic agents, either alone or in combination with existing treatments for melanoma and other cancers (i.e., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma) that show similar resistance mechanisms. Activated T cells break tumor immunosuppression by macrophage re-education.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Mayo Clinic have developed an innovative deep brain stimulation (DBS) platform that was used to not only reduce seizures, but also improve memory and sleep - two common challenges for patients with epilepsy. Epilepsy, a seizure disorder that affects about 50 million people worldwide, often disrupts memory, emotions and sleep. Many cases are drug-resistant, leaving people with limited treatment options. Researchers at Mayo Clinic found that low-frequency DBS not only reduced seizures, but it also improved memory and sleep. "Using an implanted investigational device, the team continuously monitored brain activity with AI-driven seizure and sleep tracking," says Gregory Worrell, M.D., Ph.D., Mayo Clinic neurologist and co-lead author of the study. "A cloud-based platform simultaneously assessed participants' behavior, memory and mood at home. This real-time data enables precise tuning of stimulation settings, maximizing benefits while minimizing side effects." By using an implanted device that continuously monitors brain activity, we can detect seizures more accurately than patient-reported diaries in order to optimize deep brain stimulation in real-time and improve treatment." Vaclav Kremen, Ph.D., Mayo Clinic researcher and co-lead author of the study The researchers monitored five patients with temporal lobe epilepsy throughout their DBS treatment. The system allowed patients to track their brain activity and symptoms remotely, providing doctors with detailed, real-world data to fine-tune treatments. This technology could lead to more effective treatments for drug-resistant epilepsy and could be expanded to treat other neurological and psychiatric disorders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When are you most forthcoming with life updates? For most folks - show of hands, please - it's when things are going well. Yet, it turns out, broad government transparency not only breeds goodwill, begetting still more transparency - it can change lives for the better. Researchers Sarah Anderson and Mark Buntaine, of UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, and colleagues conducted a field experiment with cities in China to demonstrate that an increase in transparency causes decreases in pollution, with meaningful effects on health. This has major policy implications because we now know that policies to induce transparency can be effective at improving governance of outcomes like pollution." More broadly, the results suggest that transparency can significantly improve how environmental policies are enforced, added Buntaine, professor of environmental institutions and government, and a lead author of the paper. "If governments provide clear and accessible information about their activities, firms respond by reducing pollution, leading to better environmental outcomes, he said. "This has implications for many countries facing similar issues, such as India, Indonesia, and the U.S., where transparency could help bridge gaps between environmental laws and actual practices, improving health and environmental quality broadly." The researchers sought to understand whether transparency itself causes better enforcement of pollution laws and cleaner air. But governments being governments, studying transparency therein can be challenging: "Those that are more transparent usually have characteristics that help them perform better overall," Buntaine said. "They might be under pressure to be both transparent and effective at the same time, making it difficult to separate the effects of transparency alone from these other pressures. Our goal was to overcome this challenge and see if an increase in transparency, independent of these other factors, directly improves environmental outcomes." To get at their answer, the team conducted a randomized experiment involving 50 Chinese cities. Half of them were publicly rated on how transparently they shared environmental information, like air quality data and pollution inspections; the other half were not rated. Then, by tracking pollution violations by firms, government inspection activities and air quality in both groups over several years, they were able to isolate the direct effects of transparency on pollution outcomes without other influencing factors - because transparency was randomly boosted. All that, and no evidence of direct public pressure, like increased citizen complaints or media coverage, was found. What they did find - and were surprised by - was just how strongly firms responded to increased transparency, suggesting that the implied threat of scrutiny is a major motivator. "This provides strong evidence that transparency is a powerful tool for better governance and can lead to meaningful improvements in public health and environmental protection globally," Buntaine said. "Transparency isn't just beneficial in theory - it has real-world impacts that save lives.
