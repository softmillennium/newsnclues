            What was a massive rally on Wall Street turned into yet another sizeable decline.
    


            Cheap stocks and hope for signs of trade negotiation sent markets surging Tuesday morning — but that relief rally evaporated as the White House said it would levy enormous tariffs on China.
    


            US stocks tumbled solidly into the red in the afternoon. The Dow fell 320 points, or 0.84%. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.57%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 2.15%.
    


            Markets fell because President Donald Trump is set to impose an additional 84% in levies across all Chinese imports on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced Tuesday. That will mean all goods from the country are subject to a tariff of at least 104%.
    


            The S&P 500 and Nasdaq, which had surged as much as 4% and 4.5%, respectively, Tuesday morning, tumbled midday as Leavitt spoke to reporters. The loss for the Dow comes after the blue-chip index surged as much as 3.85% on Tuesday morning.
    


            “We're not anywhere out of the woods yet, and so that sort of tempers things,” said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments.
    


            After markets plunged over the course of the past three trading sessions, Wall Street investors were looking for any excuse to catch their breath ahead of the planned tariff escalation at midnight — but Trump's hefty tariffs on China were a reminder that reprieve can be fleeting.
    


            Over the course of the past few days, stock prices got absolutely hammered as Wall Street grew fearful that Trump's tariff policy would plunge the US and global economies into a recession. After three days of market carnage, investors appeared to be seeking some buying opportunities.

What to do if the stock market's big drop is getting to you



            One measure of the price-to-earnings ratio of S&P 500 companies closed below 17 Monday — historically cheap, giving investors a chance to scoop up stocks they believe might be oversold.
    


            “This is a very normal action and very technical in nature after a shock period,” said Truist's Keith Lerner. “The market is extremely oversold, and markets don't move in a linear fashion.”
    


            Lerner noted that historic market rebounds tend to be clustered in with massive declines, as investors with FOMO worry they could miss out on a rally.
    


            “In a period of uncertainty, each bit of new information is overextrapolated, which leads to wider-than-normal-swings,” Lerner added.
    


            That explains why a bit of fake news Monday that Trump was considering a tariffs pause — immediately batted down by the White House — sent stocks temporarily surging. That gave markets a taste for what could happen if some nations begin to make progress in negotiating lower tariffs.
    


            “Yesterday market players saw how the hint of ‘good news' — in that case it was chatter about a pause in the Liberation Day tariffs — could rally markets by whole percentage points very quickly,” Michael Block of Third Seven Capital said in a note to investors. “Even though that proved to be all smoke, traders are now poised for the fire – that is, real news.”
    


            Investors have been on edge for any updates from the White House that might signal Trump is negotiating his trade policy.
    


            White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Tuesday on Fox News that the administration is managing “a massive number of requests for negotiations” from nations and that Trump is prioritizing “two of our closest allies and trading partners,” Japan and South Korea.
    


            Earlier on Tuesday, Trump posted on social media that he had “a great call with the Acting President of South Korea.” On Monday, Trump spoke with Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who will be sending a team to visit Washington to negotiate a trade deal.
    


            Wall Street's fear gauge, the VIX index, surged higher Tuesday after spiking to historic levels the past two sessions, reflecting jitters among traders. “Extreme fear” was the sentiment driving markets, according to CNN's Fear and Greed index.
    


            “(Traders) are peeking around every corner looking for even the slightest whiff of a trade deal or movement on the tariff front,” said Jamie Cox, managing director at Harris Financial group. “The market is wound up for a face-ripping rally.”
    


            Across the Atlantic, The European Union's executive arm said the bloc is prepared to negotiate with the United States over buying more of its liquefied natural gas. It's a response to a grievance raised Trump, who has said the EU must buy around $350 billion worth of American LNG to compensate for the deficit the US has in goods trade with the bloc.

US trade official defends Trump's tariffs, says almost 50 countries approached him to ‘explore how to achieve reciprocity'



            US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Tuesday during a routine hearing before the Senate Finance Committee that the administration is in talks with about 50 countries and that they're trying to address some non-tariff related measures, such as foreign countries' regulations that impede US exports.
    


            Greer reaffirmed that Trump's massive reciprocal tariffs will go into effect Wednesday.
    


            “We will have the president's plan go into effect, and we're coupling that with immediate negotiations with our partners,” he said.
    


            Markets tried to rebound Tuesday before sliding. It's a reminder that there's no guarantee stocks will remain buoyant.
    


            After imposing across-the-board 10% tariffs on virtually all products coming into the United States Saturday, the Trump administration is set to impose significantly steeper levies still on dozens of countries. Those tariffs, which Trump has called “reciprocal,” although they are no such thing, amount to as much as 50% for a handful of countries.
    


            China's Commerce Ministry on Tuesday said the country would “fight to the end” of the trade war and would continue to stand up to Trump.
    


            The escalating trade war between the two largest economies is turning into a high-stakes game of chicken. China has squashed deals that Trump wants — including a US company taking control of ports on both sides of the Panama Canal and a deal to sell TikTok to a US-based company. Both countries' economies would be hurt in a trade war — and given the massive trade imbalance with the United States, China could very well be hurt worse.
    


            So investors hopeful for a deal may not get one. And if they don't, a damaging trade war could bring down both economies — and markets along with them.
    


            Any escalation of the trade war would probably lead to a US and global recession this year, multiple Wall Street banks have said over the course of the past week, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. That could continue to sap demand for stocks.
    


            Although the current bounce back may be short-lived, some in the Trump administration were already declaring victory.
    


            “It's finding the bottom now. It's finding the bottom now,” Trump's top trade adviser Peter Navarro said about the market Monday evening on Fox News. “It's going to shift over and it's going to be companies in the S&P 500 who are the first to produce here. Those are the ones going to lead to recovery. And it's going to happen. Dow 50,000. I guarantee that and I guarantee no recession.”
    


            Navarro's optimism wasn't matched by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who warned in his annual letter to shareholders Monday that Trump's tariffs would raise prices, slow the global economy and weaken America's standing in the world by tearing up its alliances. Even some of Trump's allies, including Elon Musk and Bill Ackman, have recently warned that tariffs are bad policy that rely on extremely flawed logic.

            The Supreme Court ruling that permits President Donald Trump to use a centuries-old wartime authority to speed deportations is drawing sharp criticism from immigration experts who fear the decision could erode migrants' due process rights to have their cases reviewed before they're sent to a foreign prison. 



            The court's 5-4 ruling Monday night requires those challenging Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to rely on a complicated and rarely successful legal process known as habeas corpus, and to potentially file those claims in some of the most conservative federal courts in the nation.

Supreme Court allows Trump to enforce Alien Enemies Act for rapid deportations for now



            The lack of clarity around how people facing deportation under the 1798 law will be notified and whether they'll be able to access a lawyer to help them navigate that process is prompting questions about whether Trump's targets under the act will actually receive the due process the Supreme Court majority promised in its unsigned opinion.
    


             “It's hard enough for fluent English speakers to do this,” said Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants' Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School. “These are extremely significant barriers.”
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday that winning habeas challenges wouldn't be a heavy lift for the Justice Department.
    


            “It will be a much faster hearing,” Bondi said. “It will be a much smoother, simpler hearing and these people will be deported.”
    


            The Trump administration's disregard for due process has been a pattern in the legal disputes over his immigration policies. In another case pending at the Supreme Court, the administration conceded it made an error in deporting Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador last month but is fighting efforts to bring him back to the US.
    


            Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily paused a Monday midnight deadline for his return to the US in order to give the court more time to review the case. The administration has asserted that Abrego Garcia is a “high-ranking” member of the MS-13 gang, a claim that appears to be based mainly on information from what the government says is a “reliable source.”
    


            Immigration advocates have also raised questions about others deported to El Salvador based on claims they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang.  Some have claimed they were wrongly suspected of gang activity due to their tattoos.
    


            Heidi Altman, vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center, said the practical implications of the court's Alien Enemies Act ruling are significant given how difficult it is for people being detained to access attorneys.
    


            The court's opinion, she said, read like it had been written by “someone who hasn't had their eyes on the reality of the past weeks and the extreme steps this administration is willing to take to get around the very, very few due process protections that currently exist.”
    


            “They're being handed exactly what they want,” Altman said of the Trump administration. “The very quick erosion of checks and balances.”
    


            Granting a request from the Trump administration, the Supreme Court lifted a lower court order that blocked immigration officials from relying on the Alien Enemies Act to remove alleged Venezuelan gang members. The court stressed that anyone subject to removal under the act is entitled to “an opportunity to challenge their removal.”

            In one sense, that was a significant rebuke of the Trump administration, which did not previously offer notice or review before hurrying hundreds of Venezuelan nationals onto planes bound for a notorious prison in El Salvador last month. White House aide Stephen Miller, for instance, has repeatedly asserted that the people deported were not entitled to due process.
    


            But while all nine justices appear to agree that review is required, a majority of the court dramatically limited the practical options.
    


            Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union were attempting to shut down deportations under the act broadly using a federal law that lays out how an administration enacts regulations and other policies. Now, each individual may have to file their own habeas claim and demonstrate that the government's attempt to deport them is illegal.
    


            And they will have to file those suits where they are being detained, likely in Texas.
    


            Filing successful habeas claims, meanwhile, can be challenging. Years after the 2001 terrorist attacks, the Supreme Court made clear that detainees at Guantanamo Bay could challenge their detention through habeas petitions. But that process quickly ground to a halt in lower courts.
    


            “The real question is whether courts, especially federal courts in Texas, are going to provide the kind of robust, pre-removal process that the majority opinion and Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence both appear to be envisioning,” said Steve Vladeck, a CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center. “If so, then Monday's ruling may have only a modest effect going forward. But there's a reason why the Trump administration is fighting so hard to have these issues litigated in Texas and the 5th Circuit.”
    


            Dissenting on Monday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted that the Venezuelan nationals challenging Trump are not seeking to be released from custody. Rather, they want to argue they are not gang members, are not subject to Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act and should not be sent to the Center for Terrorism Confinement, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
    


            Requiring them to file individual suits, the court's senior liberal wrote, “may have life or death consequences.”
    


            “Individuals who are unable to secure counsel, or who cannot timely appeal an adverse judgment rendered by a habeas court, face the prospect of removal directly into the perilous conditions of El Salvador's CECOT, where detainees suffer egregious human rights abuses,” Sotomayor wrote.
    


            The option for immigration groups to file lawsuits on behalf of all potential deportees, meanwhile, may be limited by a 2022 Supreme Court decision. In that case, a majority of justices ruled that challenges under the Immigration and Nationality Act must be brought individually and not on a class-wide basis.

It's still Antonin Scalia's Supreme Court



            Whether that applies to the Alien Enemies Act is an open question.
    


            Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said that most people facing immigration court proceedings don't have attorneys. Even if they are able to hire one, the cases can present unique challenges. It's not always clear where Immigration and Customs Enforcement is holding a detainee, for instance.
    


            “What we're talking about with these types of cases is a heightened level of difficulty because people are detained,” she said. “Even if you have a lawyer, does your lawyer know where you are?”
    


            While the Supreme Court's decision will require the government to provide notification to a detainee that the administration may attempt to remove them under the Alien Enemies Act, Altman noted that similar notifications have historically been opaque. Given language barriers and the lack of lawyers, she said, fighting the law through habeas claims will be a challenge.
    


            The American Civil Liberties Union responded to the Supreme Court's decision with a habeas lawsuit filed in federal court in New York on Tuesday, attempting to block deportations for its clients as well others who potentially could be deported under the law.
    


            The ACLU lawsuit also asked a federal court to certify a class that would allow the case to cover anyone subject to deportation under the Alien Enemies Act.
    


            The law “has only ever been a power invoked in time of war, and plainly only applies to warlike actions,” the group wrote in the suit. “It cannot be used here against nationals of a country – Venezuela – with whom the United States is not at war.”

            Elon Musk took another jab at President Donald Trump's senior trade adviser Peter Navarro Tuesday, calling him a “moron” on social media as the Tesla CEO further splits from the White House's tariffs plan.
    


            Musk's remarks were in response to a CNBC interview with Navarro on that aired Monday, during which the White House trade adviser discussed how Tesla's position as a “car assembler” rather than a car manufacturer could be at odds with Trump's tariff policies. The comments come as Trump announced widespread tariffs on a swath of countries, causing market volatility and likely increasing the cost of cars by thousands of dollars.
    


            “In many cases, if you go to his Texas plant, a good part of the engines that he gets, which in the EV case are the batteries, come from Japan and come from China. The electronics come from Taiwan,” Navarro said.
    


            “The difference is, in our thinking and Elon's on this, is that we want the tires made in Akron,” he continued. “We want the transmissions made in Indianapolis. We want the engines made in Flint and Saginaw. And we want the cars manufactured here.”
    


            Musk said Navarro “is truly a moron” in an X post replying to a video of the comments being shared on the social media platform. “What he says here is demonstrably false,” he wrote, before calling Navarro “Peter Retarrdo” in another derogatory comment.
    


            Musk claimed “Tesla has the most American-made cars,” in another series of X posts, adding that “Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks.”
    


            “By any definition whatsoever, Tesla is the most vertically integrated auto manufacturer in America with the highest percentage of US content. Navarro should ask the fake expert he invented, Ron Vara,” he added.
    


            Tesla has dominated Cars.com's American-Made Index since 2021, based on criteria including assembly location, where the parts are made, engine origin, transmission origin and US manufacturing workforce. Still, Tesla isn't immune to tariffs, a reality that Musk has acknowledged.
    


            “The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,” he wrote on X last month.
    


            Musk's Tuesday remarks come after he posted, and then deleted, a comment saying Navarro's PhD from Harvard is a “bad thing,” and that he hasn't “built sh*t.”
    


            Navarro dismissed concerns over a clash with Musk on Monday, saying “everything is good with Elon, no problem.” when speaking to CNBC.
    


            Musk has also diverged with Trump on tariffs, posting videos about free trade and saying at an Italian event he believes there should be zero tariffs between the US and Europe. The Washington Post reported Monday that Musk also made a “direct appeal” to Trump.
    


            It's not the first time Musk has disagreed with Trump on a policy or personnel pick. But the split over tariffs is one of the more significant differences in perspective between the president and his biggest booster and top adviser.
    


            The White House for its part, is shrugging off Musk's comments.
    


            “These are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and on tariffs. Boys will be boys and we will let their public sparring continue,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing on Tuesday. “I think it also speaks to the president's willingness to hear from all sides that he has people at the highest levels of this government, in this White House, who have very diverse opinions on very diverse issues.”

DC Philippa Baskwill of Avon and Somerset police faces hearing over alleged gross misconduct

A detective is to face a misconduct hearing over allegations she deliberately weighed down the keys on her laptop to give the impression she was working while at home.

Avon and Somerset police gave notice of the accelerated misconduct hearing, which will take place on Thursday, in relation to DC Philippa Baskwill.

The notice said it was alleged Baskwill had breached standards of professional behaviour for police officers, specifically honesty and integrity, orders and instructions, and duties and responsibilities.

It is alleged that while working from home Baskwill “weighted down keys on her laptop keyboard for considerable periods of time in order to give the misleading impression that she was working”.

The statement added: “On several occasions, while working from home, DC Philippa Baskwill spent considerable and extended periods of time online for non-policing purposes, rather than carrying out her policing duties.

“It is contended that (if proven) the allegations amount to gross misconduct.”

The hearing will be held in public online but could be subject to restrictions by the force's chief constable, Sarah Crew.

In July last year, a police officer in Leicestershire was found to have been holding down a key on his laptop in order to give colleagues the impression he was working when he had in fact been sleeping.

The police officer, who resigned, used his watch to hold down the “up” key of his work laptop on numerous occasions, while working from home, the misconduct hearing heard.

It was ruled that the officer's actions amounted to gross misconduct and he would have been dismissed without notice if still employed by the force.

Last year 72% of demands to censor books were initiated by pressure groups and government entities; with just 16% of ban attempts made by parents

A large majority of attempts to ban books in the US last year came from organised groups rather than parents.

72% of demands to censor books were initiated by pressure groups, government entities and elected officials, board members and administrators, reported the American Library Association (ALA). Just 16% of ban attempts were made by parents, while 5% were brought forward by individual library users.

“These demands to remove and restrict books and other library materials are not the result of any grassroots or popular sentiment,” read the ALA's 2025 State of America's Libraries report, published on Monday. “The majority of book censorship attempts are now originating from well-funded, organised groups and movements long dedicated to curbing access to information and ideas.”

Many of the organisations leading the book censorship movement are so-called “parental rights” groups – most prominently Moms for Liberty. This group has strong ties to the Republican Party and has been labelled “extremist”.

“They aren't always moms, they don't always have kids, and they definitely don't care about ‘liberty' for everyone else,” wrote the American Civil Liberties Union's Paul Bowers in late 2023.

The share of censorship attempts made by organised campaigns has risen drastically in recent years. Between 2001 and 2020, pressure groups, board members, administrators and elected officials challenged an average of 46 titles per year. In 2024, these groups challenged 4,190 titles.

The most common reasons for challenges were claims of obscenity, the inclusion of LGBTQ+ themes or characters, and the discussion of race, racism and social justice.

“The movement to ban books is not a movement of parents, but a movement of partisans who seek to limit our freedom to read,” said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the ALA's office for intellectual freedom.

In its report, the ALA also published a list of the 10 most challenged books of 2024, which included books by Toni Morrison and John Green. The most-challenged book was All Boys Aren't Blue: A Memoir Manifesto by George M Johnson, about the author's experience as a queer Black man growing up in New Jersey and Virginia.

Last August, Moms for Liberty filed a petition to a court in New York seeking an injunction to remove All Boys Aren't Blue from a school library. The book “contains numerous profanities and lewd content” and “several instances of pornography including sexual molestation”, read the petition.

The second most-challenged title was Gender Queer: A Memoir by Maia Kobabe, while the tied third most-challenged were The Bluest Eye by Morrison and The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky. Other books on the top 10 list include Looking for Alaska by Green, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl by Jesse Andrews and Sold by Patricia McCormick.

The number of attempts to censor library books and other materials fell between 2023 and 2024, from 1,247 to 821, resulting in a fall in the total number of books challenged from 9,021 to 5,813.

The ALA said that the fall in documented censorship could be due to under-reporting or cases of “censorship by exclusion” which occurs when, for example, library workers place books in less accessible areas of the library due to fear of controversy.

Documented censorship attempts may also have fallen because recent legislative restrictions on books containing “controversial themes” have resulted in those titles being removed from libraries, according to the ALA.

President claims ‘many' countries are seeking a deal with US as he prepares to impose steep tariffs on trading partners

Donald Trump is poised to unleash his trade war with the world on Wednesday, pressing ahead with a slew of tariffs on the US's largest trading partners despite fears of widespread economic damage and calls to reconsider.

The US president claimed “many” countries were seeking a deal with Washington, as his administration prepared to impose steep tariffs on goods from dozens of markets from Wednesday.

However, Beijing vowed to “fight to the end” after Trump threatened to hit Chinese exports with additional 50% tariffs if the country proceeds with plans to retaliate against his initial vow to impose tariffs of 34% on its products. That would come on top of the existing 20% levy and take the total tariff on Chinese imports to 104%.

The White House confirmed that the higher US tariffs on China would, indeed, be imposed from Wednesday. “President Trump has a spine of steel and he will not break,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “And America will not break under his leadership.”

The billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk has also reportedly asked the president to reverse course and the conservative businessmen Leonard Leo and Charles Koch have filed a lawsuit against the “illegal” tariffs.

The latest tariffs are higher than the 10% flat rate imposed on all global imports to the US on Friday last week and are tailored to specific countries based on a formula that has been criticised by economists that divides trade in goods deficit by twice the total value of imports.

After days of turmoil since they were first unveiled last week, global markets recovered some ground on Tuesday as senior US officials attempted to reassure investors that the new tariffs – including rates of 20% on the European Union, 26% on India and 49% on Cambodia – could be temporary.

The FTSE 100 rallied by 2.7% in London, recovering some of the losses it has endured since Trump's announcement – on what was dubbed “liberation day” by his aides – last week. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 gained 2.8% as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.9%.

They tracked Asian markets higher. The Nikkei 225 rallied 6% in Tokyo. The Hang Seng Index rose 1.5% in Hong Kong.

Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, has insisted the new tariffs are at “maximum” levels, and expressed confidence that negotiations will bring them down.

“I think you are going to see some very large countries with large trade deficits [with the US] come forward very quickly,” he told CNBC, the financial news network, on Tuesday. “If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals.”

Trump was asked on Monday whether the tariffs set the stage for negotiations with countries, or were permanent. “Well, it can both be true,” he told reporters. “There can be permanent tariffs, and there can also be negotiations.”

But he again raised the prospect of agreements with countries on Tuesday, trailing a potential deal with South Korea.

“Their top TEAM is on a plane heading to the US, and things are looking good,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “We are likewise dealing with many other countries, all of whom want to make a deal with the United States.”

The president added: “‘ONE STOP SHOPPING' is a beautiful and efficient process!!! China also wants to make a deal, badly, but they don't know how to get it started. We are waiting for their call. It will happen!”

Rachel Reeves, the UK chancellor, sought to ease concerns about market volatility, telling parliament she had spoken to Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, who confirmed “markets are functioning effectively and that our banking system is resilient”.

A trade war “is in nobody's interest”, Reeves argued, confirming that the UK was seeking to negotiate a new deal with the US. Trump has imposed a 10% tariff on UK exports, in line with the minimum benchmark introduced at the weekend.

She declined to back Liberal Democrat calls for the government to launch a “buy British” campaign. “In terms of buying British, I think everyone will make their own decisions,” Reeves said. “What we don't want to see is a trade war, with Britain becoming inward-looking.”

China adopted an altogether different stance. In a scathing editorial, the official state news outlet Xinhua accused the US president of “naked extortion”.

“Utterly absurd is the underlying logic of the United States: ‘I can hit you at my will, and you must not respond. Instead, you must surrender unconditionally,'” it said. “This is not diplomacy. It is blunt coercion dressed up as policy.”

On social media a 1987 speech by then US president Ronald Reagan posted by China's foreign ministry has been widely shared. The video clip, in which Reagan criticises the use of tariffs as leading to retaliation and ultimately hurting the US economy, “has a new meaning in 2025”, China's the Paper said.

Bessent argued on Tuesday that China was making a “big mistake” by daring to retaliate. “They're playing with a pair of twos,” he claimed on CNBC. “What do we lose by the Chinese raising tariffs on us? We export one-fifth to them of what they export to us, so that is a losing hand for them.”

            The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed the Trump administration to keep several thousand probationary federal employees it is attempting to fire off the payroll while lower courts weigh whether the downsizing efforts are legal, the latest in a series of wins for the White House at the conservative high court.
    


            The Supreme Court's decision blocks a ruling from a lower court judge that required the government to temporarily reinstate more than 16,000 probationary employees.
    


            In a brief, two-paragraph order, the court said that the unions who filed the litigation didn't have standing to sue. The decision didn't address the merits of the arguments, and it is not the final word on whether the employees will be allowed to keep their jobs, but it will have a significant impact on both the workers and the agencies in the meantime.
    


            Two liberal justices – Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson – publicly dissented. Jackson offered a brief explanation, questioning the need for the high court to enter into the case on an emergency basis.
    


            The full implications of the ruling are not clear given that a federal judge in Maryland earlier this month issued a preliminary injunction that reinstated some of the employees not covered in the case before the Supreme Court.
    


            Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said that the decision was a relatively limited one.
    


            “All that the court said here is that the nonprofit organizations who obtained an injunction in San Francisco weren't the right parties to challenge the mass firings,” he said. “It's another win for Trump, but once again only with regard to who can and can't sue, and in which courts. Other challenges to the mass firings have already resulted in rulings against the government in other cases, and those remain in place.”
    


            Still, the decision was a win for the Trump administration, which had asked the high court to step into the case to toss out the lower court's order. It came a day after the court also allowed the administration to continue deportations under the controversial Alien Enemies Act – though with some new limitations added.
    


            In its effort to slash the size of the federal government, the Trump administration has targeted probationary workers because they have fewer job protections and can be dismissed more easily. While those employees generally cannot appeal their termination to the Merit Systems Protection Board, they may do so if the action stemmed from “partisan political reasons” or “marriage status.”
    


            In the case at hand, labor unions and other groups had challenged the Office of Personnel Management's role in the firings, which affected thousands of employees and sent shockwaves through various federal agencies, some of which later rehired some of the workers.
    


            US District Judge William Alsup, nominated by President Bill Clinton, ordered the administration to “immediately” offer over 16,000 probationary employees their jobs back.
    


            “Each agency had (and still has) discretion to hire and fire its own employees,” Alsup wrote in his opinion. “Here, the agencies were directed by OPM to fire all probationary employees, and they executed that directive. To staunch the irreparable harms to organizational plaintiffs caused by OPM unlawfully slashing other agency's staff required immediately reinstating those employees.”
    


            But Trump framed the case as another example of the federal judiciary stepping in to manage the decisions it says should be left to the executive branch.
    


            “The district court's extraordinarily overbroad remedy is now inflicting ongoing, irreparable harm on the Executive Branch that warrants this Court's urgent intervention,” Sarah Harris, who was then the administration's acting solicitor general, told the Supreme Court.

            Rescue workers are racing to reach around 100 people still trapped under rubble after the roof of a nightclub in the Dominican Republic collapsed during a busy musical performance in the early hours of Tuesday, killing at least 44 and injuring dozens more.
    


            At least 146 people have so far been pulled alive from the debris of the Jet Set nightclub in Santo Domingo, the country's capital, said Juan Manuel Méndez, director of the Emergency Operations Center. When the roof collapsed, at least 300 people were inside the venue, he added.
    


            Families of the missing gathered at the scene and shared pictures of their loved ones, as more than 150 ambulances rushed the injured to hospital. Personnel from at least 22 public institutions are at the site helping with response efforts, officials said.
    


            The cause of the collapse is not yet known.
    


            Aerial footage from local news outlets on Tuesday morning showed the venue with a wide, gaping hole in the middle of the building where the audience would have been located during the performance.
    


            Among the dead was Nelsy Cruz, governor of the Monte Cristi province, Dominican President Luis Abinader said. Cruz was related to MLB all-star Nelson Cruz, according a statement from his family mourning her death.
    


            The roof caved in at around 1 a.m. local time while merengue artist Rubby Pérez and his orchestra were performing on stage, authorities said.
    


            Footage from inside the venue appears to show the moment the crisis unfolded.
    


            One video shows the band performing while someone near the stage points out that something had fallen in the back of the club. Moments later, pendant lights suspended from the ceiling start to collapse, along with the entire roof overhead. Screams and crashing sounds can be heard for a few seconds before the video goes dark.
    


            Pérez's daughter told local media that her father survived the collapse. She said rescue workers found him singing under the rubble. “He started to sing so they could hear him,” she said.
    


            Former MLB pitcher and World Series champion Octavio Dotel was also found alive and taken to a hospital for treatment, Méndez said. Meanwhile, the son of Public Works Minister Eduardo Estrella is among the missing, Méndez added.
    


            Abinader has declared three days of mourning following the disaster. He traveled to the nightclub later Tuesday morning with his wife, First Lady Raquel Arbaje, to express their condolences to the victims.
    


            “We deeply regret the tragedy that occurred at the Jet Set nightclub,” Abinader wrote on X. “All rescue agencies have provided the necessary assistance and are working tirelessly in the rescue efforts. Our prayers are with the affected families.”
    


            Carolina Mejía de Garrigó, the city's mayor, said Santo Domingo was waking “to a terrible tragedy,” offering her condolences to families “still waiting for news of their loved ones.”
    


            The Jet Set nightclub is one of the Caribbean nation's most famous venues, and its Monday night events are especially well attended.

            A California man pleaded guilty Tuesday to attempting to assassinate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, two months before he was set to go on trial for the 2022 murder plot.
    


            Appearing in a federal courtroom in Maryland, Nicholas Roske, 29, entered a guilty plea for the single charge he faces: attempting to assassinate a United States justice. US District Judge Deborah Boardman accepted the plea during the hearing, saying he was “fully capable and competent” of entering it.
    


            Kavanaugh's name wasn't said during the hearing, which lasted less than an hour. Boardman referred to the justice only as “Victim 1.”
    


            Roske spoke few words during the proceedings, only addressing the judge to give short answers to a litany of procedural and factual questions she posed. He said he was being treated for a mental illness, including with medication.
    


            Boardman, cautioning that she doesn't yet know the sentencing guidelines for Roske, noted that prosecutors have estimated his sentencing range as being between 30 years and life in prison.
    


            The judge set Roske's sentencing hearing for early October. He'll remain detained while he awaits sentencing.
    


            Roske, armed with a handgun, knife and zip ties, flew across the country and took a taxi to Kavanaugh's Maryland home late at night in June 2022. He turned around when he saw Kavanaugh's security detail, court documents say. Roske then spoke to his sister over the phone, and she convinced him to call 911 instead of carrying out the attack.
    


            The arrest sparked mass concern about the Supreme Court justices' security. Roske allegedly told investigators after his arrest that the assassination attempt was in part motivated by the high court's draft decision overturning Roe v. Wade and its potential expansion of gun rights.
    


            “I've been suicidal for a long time,” Roske told authorities after his arrest, a transcript of the interview shows. “And when I saw that the leaked draft, it made me upset and then it made me want to — I don't know … I was under the delusion that I could make the world a better place by killing him.”
    


            Roske's attorneys have said in court filings that when the then-26-year-old was arrested, he was “acutely suicidal, visibly exhausted, and had repeatedly expressed his need for psychiatric care.”

            A top White House trade official has a message for world leaders caught in the crosshairs of US President Donald Trump's tariff plans: it's “just the beginning.”
    


            Peter Navarro, the president's senior counselor on trade and manufacturing, wrote in an opinion piece in the Financial Times Monday that other countries — in addition to tariffs on US goods — have unfairly targeted American products with a raft of “non-tariff weapons,” including laws targeting big US tech firms and “discriminatory” product standards.
    


            “To those world leaders who, after decades of cheating, are suddenly offering to lower tariffs — know this: that's just the beginning,” he wrote.
    


            Trump's plans to impose punishing “reciprocal” tariffs on imported goods from dozens of countries have triggered massive drops in global stock markets in recent days.
    


            Since the president announced the new levies last Wednesday, the S&P 500 has plummeted nearly 11%, which wiped $5.2 trillion off America's benchmark stock index alone. The rout has taken the US from a bull stock market to the brink of a bear market — defined as a fall of 20% from its recent peak — faster than under any president in modern history.

            Based on Monday's closing level, the S&P 500 is down 17.6% from its record high on February 19. The tech-stock heavy Nasdaq Composite index has already crossed into bear market territory, shedding 22.6% between its all-time high on December 16 and Monday's close.
    


            But the losses don't appear to have spooked Navarro, who referred in his article to Trump's tariff agenda as a “long-overdue restructuring” of an international trading system “rigged against America.”
    


            Navarro wrote that “Trump's reciprocal tariff doctrine does exactly what the (World Trade Organization) has failed to do: it holds foreign countries accountable.”
    


            Trump has strongly criticized what he describes as years of lopsided trade between America and other countries. According to the White House, America's trading partners have imposed steeper tariffs on US goods imported into their markets than the US does on theirs.
    


            Navarro singled out America's trade deficit in goods, which hit $1.2 trillion in 2024 — its highest level on record, according to official US data. He called the deficit a “crisis.” In services trade, however, the US runs a surplus of $295 billion with the rest of the world.
    


            Regardless, Navarro wrote that “America must — and now is — defending itself.”
    


            Among the so-called defensive measures are new tariffs of 34% and 20% soon to be levied on major trading partners China and the European Union, respectively.
    


            For its part, the EU said Tuesday that Europe and China have a responsibility to “support a strong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field.” That's according to a statement released after Ursula von der Leyen, a top EU official, held a phone call with Chinese Premier Li Qiang to discuss EU-China relations.
    


            If the Trump administration, which presides over the world's largest economy, is “defending” itself as Navarro says, it is also doing so against some of the world's poorest nations.
    


            For example, Trump has whacked Madagascar — an island off the coast of Southern Africa where more than 80% of the population lives in extreme poverty — with a 47% tariff on top of the 10% baseline levy he has imposed on all countries.
    


            And in contrast to Navarro's fondness for higher tariffs, Elon Musk — a top Trump acolyte and the world's richest man — said Sunday that he hopes for a “zero-tariff situation” between Europe and the US.
    


            Musk doesn't appear to hold Navarro in high regard generally. In an exchange Saturday on X, which has since been deleted, Musk said about Navarro's academic background: “A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing.” The Tesla CEO also added: “He ain't built sh*t.”

            President Donald Trump was speaking to reporters alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office on Monday when he made a surprise announcement: Direct nuclear talks are underway between the United States and Iran and a “very big meeting” will take place on Saturday.

Trump says US has begun direct talks with Iran over its nuclear program



            If true, these would be the first direct talks between the two nations since 2015, when they signed a landmark nuclear deal under the Obama administration, which Trump ditched three years later.
    


            Iran denies that negotiations are direct, insisting they will be mediated by the Gulf Arab nation of Oman, where Saturday's talks will take place. Direct or not, the talks represent a breakthrough between the Islamic Republic and a US administration led by a president whom American officials accuse Tehran of once plotting to assassinate.
    


            Trump has pledged to deliver a far “stronger” nuclear deal than Obama's. His administration has said it will push for the complete dismantling of Iran's nuclear program, rather than merely restricting it to peaceful purposes. Israel backs this demand – but Tehran has dismissed it outright as a non-starter.
    


            Here's what we know about the talks, why they may be happening now and what's at stake.
    


            Trump on Monday said a “very big meeting” would take place Saturday “at the top level,” adding that “everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious,” referring to potential military action against Iranian nuclear sites.
    


            A person familiar with the plans confirmed to CNN that US officials will meet Iranian officials in person in Oman to discuss a nuclear deal.
    


            Iran, which has rejected the prospects of direct talks with the US under threats of attack, insists it will be holding indirect talks with the US in Oman. It will be represented by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and the US will send Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, Iran's semi-official Tasnim News reported Tuesday, citing Araghchi. There has been no confirmation of Witkoff's alleged participation from the US.
    


            On Monday, Araghchi said the meeting would be “as much an opportunity as it is a test.”
    


            “The ball is in America's court,” he wrote on X.
    


            Hossein Mousavian, a former Iranian diplomat and ex-nuclear negotiator, said that Iran and the US are likely to “initially start the negotiations indirectly, and after an hour or two, if the outcome is positive, Iranian and American representatives will begin direct talks.”
    


            “It seems that Washington and Tehran have adopted a wise approach, and there is a chance for an agreement,” he wrote on X.



            A nuclear deal was reached in 2015 between Iran and world powers, including the US.
    


            Under the deal, Iran had agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.
    


            That agreement was, however, abandoned by Trump in 2018 during his first presidential term. Iran retaliated by resuming its nuclear activities, and has so far advanced its program to alarming levels.



            In December, Rafael Grossi, the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, told Reuters that Iran was “dramatically” accelerating its enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, closer to the roughly 90% level that is weapons grade. In January, Grossi again warned that Iran was “pressing the gas pedal” on its uranium enrichment.
    


            Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful.
    


            Last month, Trump sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei proposing negotiations on a new nuclear deal, making it clear that Iran had a two-month deadline to reach an agreement, a source familiar with the letter's contents told CNN.
    


            Days later, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said the Islamic Republic rejected direct negotiations with the US. He said however that Iran's response, delivered by Oman, left open the possibility of indirect talks with Washington.

            “We don't avoid talks; it's the breach of promises that has caused issues for us so far,” Pezeshkian said in televised remarks. “They must prove that they can build trust.”
    


            Iran has in recent weeks been vocal with its concerns about striking a nuclear deal with Trump, who it says has a history of backtracking.
    


            Pezeshkian was elected last year on a reformist agenda that pledged to mend the country's relationship with the world and ease sanctions that have crippled the economy. But he also faces a powerful hardline establishment, including Khamenei, that distrusts the US and is wary of engaging with it.
    


            The value of Iran's currency, the rial, increased off the back of the news of talks after recording a record low just weeks ago.
    


            US officials have said that Trump is demanding that Iran dismantle its entire nuclear program, and not just accept restrictions on its ability to build a nuclear weapon, as it did in 2015.
    


            The 2015 deal allowed Iran to “fully enjoy its right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes under the relevant articles of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT),” according to the treaty. The NPT, to which Iran is signatory, is an international agreement aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.

As Trump offers new nuclear talks, Iran weighs the cost of losing its final leverage



            Experts have said that complete denuclearization would be a non-starter for Iran given that the nuclear program is its last remaining point of leverage against the West after its regional proxies have been weakened.
    


            Last week, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz told CBS' “Face the Nation” that Trump will demand a “full dismantlement” of Iran's uranium enrichment program.
    


            “Iran has to give up its program in a way that the entire world can see,” Waltz said, adding that Tehran must agree to “walk away completely” from its pursuit of nuclear weapons.
    


            Waltz added that this time, the deal will not be “some kind of tit for tat that we had under the Obama administration, or Biden.”
    


            Asked whether the deal would be similar to the 2015 agreement, Trump on Monday told reporters that “it'll be different, and maybe a lot stronger.”
    


            If talks are not successful, Trump added, “I think Iran's going to be in great danger…I actually think it'll be a very bad day for Iran.”
    


            The sudden revelation of the upcoming US-Iran talks at the press conference following Trump and Netanyahu's meeting appeared to surprise the Israeli prime minister, the smile quickly vanishing from his face as he looked toward his team of advisers.
    


            News of the talks are “certainly not” to Israel's liking, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            It's unclear if Netanyahu was given advance notice of the US-Iran talks or if he was consulted ahead of time, the sources said.
    


            Sat beside Trump at the Oval Office, Netanyahu touted a Libya-style nuclear deal between the US and Iran, which in 2003 dismantled the North African nation's nuclear program in the hopes of ushering in a new era of relations with the US after its two-decade oil embargo on Muammar Qaddafi's regime.
    


            “If it can be done diplomatically, in a full way, the way it was done in Libya, I think that would be a good thing,” Netanyahu said.



            Following denuclearization, Libya eventually descended into civil war after a 2011 NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed Qaddafi. Iranian officials have long warned that a similar deal would be intended to weaken Iran and eventually overthrow its regime.
    


            Asked about a Libya-style deal, Araghchi told Iranian media on Tuesday that Israel's hopes for what Iran's nuclear program should look like would be disregarded.
    


            “When it comes to the Zionist regime's hopes of what a deal will look like and what they have suggested, that's their hopes and ultimately will not be factored in,” he said.
    


            Netanyahu had vehemently opposed the 2015 nuclear deal, saying it did not prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon.
    


            Since the last US-Iran talks, Tehran has seen its ability to project power in the region significantly curtailed after Israel struck severe blows to its allied regional militias and launched direct attacks on Iranian soil.
    


            In Gaza, Israel continues to pound the enclave as it seeks to eradicate Hamas. In Syria, which Iran used as transit for weapons to proxies, Tehran's ally Bashar al-Assad has been deposed, and Israel continues to attack the country and take new territory. In Iraq, the US has retaliated against attacks by Iran-backed militants on its assets there. And in Lebanon, a series of Israeli attacks on the country have decapitated the militant group Hezbollah.
    


            In Yemen, where Iran's last remaining ally, the Houthi rebel group, remains standing, the US is intensifying airstrikes.
    


            Last year, Iran and Israel exchanged two rounds of tit-for-tat attacks, the first time either side has directly attacked the other. Israel is said to have taken out Iranian defenses in one of those attacks.
    


            “Remember, the Iranians' air defenses have been eviscerated by that attack from Israel. They're open to attack today,” Witkoff told journalist Tucker Carlson in an interview last month.

Ukrainian president says men's capture shows Moscow is trying to involve Beijing in the war ‘directly or indirectly'

Ukrainian forces have captured two Chinese nationals fighting with the Russian army in the eastern Donetsk region, according to Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The Ukrainian president said they were two of many more Chinese members of the Russian armed forces, and he accused the Kremlin of trying to involve Beijing in the conflict “directly or indirectly”.

Zelenskyy said he would ask his foreign minister “to immediately contact Beijing and clarify how China intends to respond to this”, though it was not clear if the captured soldiers had been sent at the behest of their government or were individuals who had chosen for themselves to sign up.

A few hundred Chinese nationals are thought to have travelled to fight as mercenaries with the Russian army alongside others from Nepal and central Asian countries. Their status appears different to the 11,000 soldiers from North Korea who were deployed on the frontline after a political agreement between Pyongyang and Moscow.

Zelenskyy said identity documents, bank cards and personal data were found in the possession of the two men captured, and that his country's domestic security agency, the SBU, was “verifying all the facts”.

He argued that the capture of the two men indicated that Russia had no interest in agreeing to a ceasefire in US-brokered peace negotiations, which have made only limited progress over the past two months.

“Russia's involvement of China, along with other countries, whether directly or indirectly, in this war in Europe is a clear signal that Putin intends to do anything but end the war. He is looking for ways to continue fighting,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media.

He said the development “definitely requires a response” from the US, Europe and “all those around the world who want peace”. There was no immediate reaction from Moscow or Beijing.

Below his post on X, Zelenskyy released a short video apparently showing a captured soldier, his hands tied, speaking in Mandarin. Prisoners of war are protected from public curiosity according to the Geneva conventions and should not have their images published online.

China says it is a neutral party in the conflict. Russia makes heavy use of Chinese-made components in its arms industry, and Ukraine does so to some extent. Both sides make significant use of Mavic drones from the Chinese manufacturer DJI, though Kyiv is trying to reduce its dependence on products from Beijing.

Individuals from about 70 countries, including the US, UK and other European countries, have fought with Ukraine's military. Some units, such as the Azov brigade, have actively sought to recruit foreigners to bolster forces depleted after more than three years of war.

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said two Chinese nationals fighting in the Russian army have been taken prisoner in eastern Ukraine.
    


Zelensky said Tuesday that Ukrainian forces fighting in the Donetsk region obtained the Chinese nationals' documents, bank cards and personal data.
    


            “We have information that there are many more Chinese citizens in the occupier's units than just two. We are now finding out all the facts,” Zelensky said in a post on Telegram. “I have instructed the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to immediately contact Beijing and find out how China is going to react to this.”

            “Russia's involvement of China in this war in Europe, directly or indirectly, is a clear signal that Putin is going to do anything except end the war. He is looking for ways to continue fighting,” Zelensky said.
    


            It is unclear if the Chinese nationals that Ukraine says it captured are Chinese soldiers or volunteers. 



            The Ukrainian president also called on its allies in the United States and Europe to protest.
    


            Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Tuesday that Kyiv has summoned Beijing's chargé d'affaires in Ukraine “to condemn this fact and demand an explanation.”
    


            “We hope that after this situation, the Americans will talk more with Ukrainians and then with Russians. And we hope that the Chinese side will also respond,” Zelensky said Tuesday afternoon during a news conference.
    


            “This is another country that militarily supports Russia's invasion of Ukraine on the side of Russia. This is another one after Iran and the North Korean military,” he added.
    


            CNN has reached out to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Russia's Ministry of Defense for comment.
    


            China's foreign ministry said in a January 2024 social media post that its citizens should stay away from conflict zones, urging them to “avoid involvement in conflicts in any form — particularly refraining from participating in military actions of any party.”
    


China has helped Russia ramp up its defense industrial base as it continues its war against Ukraine, senior Biden administration officials told CNN last year.
    


            The support China has provided includes significant quantities of machine tools, drone and turbojet engines and technology for cruise missiles, microelectronics, and nitrocellulose, which Russia uses to make propellant for weapons, the officials said in April 2024.
    


            Meanwhile, Russia has also considerably strengthened its military relationship with North Korea over the last year, with the two signing a mutual defense agreement and Pyongyang sending its troops to fight for Moscow in its invasion of Ukraine.
    


            In January, Ukrainian forces operating in the Kursk region of Russia captured two North Korean soldiers.
    


            Russian attacks on Ukraine in the last 24 hours killed at least three people and injured 19 others, according to Ukrainian officials. Russia carried out attacks on the Ukrainian regions of Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv and Kherson, local officials said.
    


            Elsewhere on the frontlines, Russia's Ministry of Defense said Tuesday that it has retaken one of the last villages held by Ukraine in the Kursk region, months after Kyiv launched a surprise cross-border incursion.
    


            “The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation continue to defeat the Ukrainian Armed Forces formations in the Kursk region. Units of the North group of forces have liberated the settlement of Guyevo in the Kursk region during offensive operations,” the Russian Ministry of Defense said in a statement.
    


            The US-based conflict monitor the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in an update Monday that Russian forces have recently advanced in Kursk. ISW's map of the incursion shows that Ukrainian troops remain only in small parts of the Russian region.
    


            Ukrainian troops have occupied part of the Kursk region since August 2024, though Russian forces have since recaptured much of the territory.
    


            Meanwhile, a Ukrainian regiment released video on Tuesday showing strikes on Russia's neighboring Belgorod region, one day after Zelensky confirmed for the first time on Monday that his country's troops have been active in the region as they seek to protect Ukrainian towns near the border.
    


            Ukraine's 225th separate assault regiment said the video shows its forces destroying two bridges in Belgorod, in the villages of Grafovka and Nadezhevka. CNN has verified that those are the locations shown in the video.
    


            “Then the drone operations and clearing the ground followed,” the regiment said in a Telegram post, confirming their presence on the ground in Russian territory.
    


            Ukrainian forces began limited attacks in Russia's northwestern Belgorod region on March 18, according to ISW, in areas just across the border from Ukraine. The Russian Defense Ministry previously said it defeated Ukrainian troops attacking Belgorod.

Musk's unsuccessful attempts may be sign of growing rift between US president and tech billionaire

Elon Musk made personal, repeated attempts to try to get Donald Trump to back off from the wave of global tariffs that have created turmoil in international markets, it was reported on Tuesday.

Musk's failure to get Trump to listen, however, is evidence to some observers of a growing rift between the US president and the world's richest person, who has been leading the White House's efforts to curb federal spending as head of the unofficial department of government efficiency (Doge).

Two sources confirmed to the Washington Post that Musk had made a number of personal approaches to Trump over the weekend to try to persuade him to reverse the slate of trade tariffs he announced last Thursday on a vast number of countries, many of them longstanding US allies.

Their imposition tanked stock markets worldwide on Monday, wiped trillions of dollars from the values of numerous companies, and dinged the wealth of several billionaire friends of Trump, including Musk, a founder of Tesla and SpaceX, and owner of X – whose personal fortune fell below $300bn for the first time since last year, according to reports.

Trump's strategy has also drawn widespread criticism from economists, political opponents and even some members of his Republican party, with a rightwing libertarian group that has been funded by the conservative businessmen Leonard Leo and Charles Koch filing a lawsuit against the “illegal” tariffs.

The Post did not publish details of the conversations between Musk and Trump. But the president ultimately disregarded the representations and doubled down on his policy on Monday by threatening to impose an additional 50% tariff on China after it responded to the original trade levy by announcing a 34% tariff on US imports.

At the same time as Musk was pleading with Trump, he was appearing online at a rightwing conference in Italy calling for zero tariffs between the US and the European Union. “That has certainly been my advice to the president,” he told attenders of the far-right League party conference in Florence.

On Monday, Musk escalated an insult-heavy social media feud with Peter Navarro, a key Trump ally and White House trade adviser said to be a guiding force behind the tariffs strategy.

Over the weekend, in response to a video Navarro posted about the administration's rationale for the tariff strategy, Musk attacked Navarro's master's degree in economics from Harvard University. Musk did the same in a reply to a commentator who praised the Navarro video, writing: “He ain't built shit.”

More name-calling followed on Monday, after Navarro called Musk a “car assembler” rather than a manufacturer because many Tesla electric vehicle (EV) parts come from overseas.

“Navarro truly is a moron. What he says here is demonstrably false,” Musk said in one post. In another, he wrote a derogatory term for somebody with a learning disability and added: “Tesla has the most American-made cars. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks.”

Neither the Trump administration nor Musk responded to requests for comment.

The Post said Musk's opposition to what has become Trump's signature economic policy “marks the highest-profile disagreement between the president and one of his key advisers”. It follows reports that the billionaire will soon be leaving government to return to running his businesses.

Experts, however, expect the split to be amicable, with Musk set to retain close ties and influence with the president as well as on US politics generally.

“Elon is fantastic,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on his way to Florida on Thursday, saying he wished Musk could stay in government but wanted to return to his various companies.

Tesla, in particular, has seen a sharp drop in sales of EVs in the US and Europe since Musk began his work for Doge. A backlash to Musk's politics materialized in the form of protests and vandalism at his vehicle dealerships.

The FBI announced in March that it was forming a taskforce to target violence at Tesla sales points and charging stations, which included the discovery of incendiary devices at a dealership in Austin, Texas, and the arrest of a man in West Palm Beach, Florida, who allegedly tried to use an SUV to strike a group of protesters.

Shares in Tesla were trading at $233.29 at market close on Monday, Reuters reported, down more than 42% since the beginning of the year.

More trouble for Musk could be looming in Washington DC over potential conflicts of interest involving SpaceX, a key Nasa contractor.

The Democratic congressmen Gerald Connolly and Maxwell Frost have written to Nasa's chief legal officer seeking information about $38bn in government contracts awarded to SpaceX at a time when Musk's Doge is gutting federal spending and slashing jobs at numerous federal institutions, including the US government's space agency.

“At Nasa, where Mr Musk has both benefited from significant contracts and has the potential to receive vast amounts of new business, his defiance of recusal laws and control of operations directly benefit his businesses,” the Democrats wrote.

“The known conflicts of interest presented by this arrangement are illegal and must be addressed immediately.”

Prince Laurent had argued that his work entitled him to the same benefits as  independent entrepreneurs but a court in Brussels disagreed

A Belgian prince has lost a legal battle to claim social security benefits on top of his royal allowance, with a court ruling his claim – the first of its kind in the country's nearly 200-year history – “unfounded”.

Prince Laurent, the youngest of three children of the former king and queen, had argued that his work entitled him to the coverage granted to independent entrepreneurs – and that he was acting out of “principle” rather than for money.

But a Brussels court found on Monday that the 61-year-old's duties were more akin to those in the civil service, where categories of workers receive specific benefits but there is no overarching social security system.

A lawyer for the prince, Olivier Rijckaert, said his client was considering whether to appeal. “We're not where we wanted to be, but the judgment is very detailed, very reasoned, I understand the reasoning,” Rijckaert told Agence France-Presse.

In 2018, his annual state allowance was cut by 15% for a year because he met foreign dignitaries without the federal government's approval.

Laurent received €388,000 (£333,000) last year from state coffers and lives in his home rent-free. “This is not about financial means but principle,” he told Belgian broadcaster RTBF. “When a migrant comes here, he registers, he has a right to it. I may be a migrant too, but one whose family established the state in place,” he added.

The prince did not take legal action on a “whim”, lawyer Rijckaert said in an article in Le Soir newspaper. Social security is “a right granted by Belgian law to every resident, from the poorest to the biggest billionaire”, he said.

He said Laurent received a salary worth only 25% of his allowance, because the rest went on covering professional expenses including travel and wages for a staff member.

Rijckaert said this results in a monthly net wage for the prince of €5,000 which is comparable to the “average salary of a senior executive in Belgium” but without the usual “full social security coverage”.

Laurent and his British wife, Claire, have three children now in their 20s. He pointed to medical costs and his concerns over his family's financial well-being, since the royal allowance will be cut when he dies.

Without the social security coverage, Laurent cannot claim reimbursement for certain medical expenses, or sick pay if he is unable to work.

The prince has had an animal welfare foundation offering free veterinary care in clinics for the past 10 years. He said the foundation work, alongside dozens of visits representing Belgium and participation on several boards, meant he has a busy schedule.

He is not the only Belgian royal to have been unhappy about money. When King Albert II abdicated in favour of his son Philippe in 2013 after reigning for 20 years, the ex-monarch found his €923,000 a year insufficient.

Illegal practices included use of bots to hoard tickets for attraction in Rome for resale at inflated prices

An Italian ticketing company and six tour operators have been fined almost €20m (£17m) for illegal practices that made it difficult for regular visitors to access Rome's Colosseum at the standard cost.

Italy's antitrust authority, AGCM, said the practices, including using software bots to hoard tickets and resell them at higher prices, made it “essentially impossible” to buy tickets online for site.

The Colosseum is among the most popular landmarks in the world. More than 12 million people visited it in 2024.

AGCM said it had fined CoopCulture, which managed official ticket sales for the site between 1997 and 2024, €7m for “knowingly contributing to the substantial and prolonged unavailability” of standard-priced tickets.

“On the one hand, CoopCulture failed to take adequate steps to counter automated ticket hoarding,” AGCM said in a statement. “On the other, it kept a sizeable share of tickets for bundled sales tied to its own educational tours, which generated considerable profits.”

Customers were forced to turn to tour operators and online platforms, which resold tickets at higher tickets, bundling them with additional services such as guided tours, pickups from hotels and priority access.

The remainder of the fine was handed out to six tours operators based in Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland, which scooped up tickets in bulk using software bots and other tools, contributing to their rapid disappearance from CoopCulture's website.

AGCM said: “The operators benefited from the constant unavailability of tickets, which left consumers seeking access to the Colosseum with no choice but to purchase them through these channels – often at much higher prices due to the bundling with additional services offered either directly or via other operators.”

The authority did not say how much people ended up paying for entrance to the Colosseum as a result of the illegal practices. The website for the ancient site, which is operated by Italy's culture ministry, lists the basic adult ticket price at €18. That gives tourists 20 minutes to explore the amphitheatre's main floor. A “full experience” ticket costs €24 and gives access to the wider Colosseum archaeological park, including the ruins of the Forum and the Palatine hill.

Crews search for survivors after more than 120 injured at Jet Set in Santo Domingo

At least 18 people have died and more than 120 injured after a roof collapsed at a nightclub in the capital of the Dominican Republic early on Tuesday, authorities said.
 Crews were searching for potential survivors in the rubble at Jet Set in Santo Domingo, said Juan Manuel Méndez, director of the Center of Emergency Operations.
 “We presume that many of them are still alive, and that is why the authorities here will not give up until not a single person remains under that rubble,” he said.
 Nelsy Cruz, the governor of Montecristi, was among the victims. The injured included the merengue singer Rubby Pérez, who was performing when the roof collapsed, officials said.
 His manager, Enrique Paulino, whose shirt was spattered with blood, told reporters at the scene that the concert began shortly before midnight, with the roof collapsing almost an hour later, killing the group's saxophonist.
 “It happened so quickly. I managed to throw myself into a corner,” he said, adding that he initially thought it was an earthquake.
 President Luis Abinader wrote on X that all rescue agencies were “working tirelessly” to help those affected.
 “We deeply regret the tragedy that occurred at the Jet Set nightclub. We have been following the incident minute by minute since it occurred,” he said.
 Abinader arrived at the scene and hugged people looking for friends and family, some of them crying. He did not speak to reporters.

An official with a megaphone stood outside the club asking the large crowd that had gathered to search for friends and relatives to make room for ambulances.
 “You have to cooperate with authorities, please,” he said. “We are removing people.”
 At one hospital where the injured were taken, an official stood outside reading aloud the names of survivors as a crowd gathered around her and shouted out the names of their loved ones.
 It was not immediately clear what caused the roof to collapse.

Crews search for survivors after more than 160 injured at Jet Set in Santo Domingo

At least 27 people have died and more than 160 injured after a roof collapsed at a nightclub in the capital of the Dominican Republic early on Tuesday, the authorities said.

“It happened so quickly. I managed to throw myself into a corner,” he said, adding that he initially thought it was an earthquake.

It was not immediately clear what caused the roof to collapse.

Manuel Olivo Ortiz, whose son attended the concert and is still missing, was among those anxiously waiting outside the club, which is known for its traditional parties held on Monday and where renowned national and international artists perform.

“We're holding on only to God,” Olivo said.

The Dominican Republic's president, Luis Abinader, wrote on X that all rescue agencies were “working tirelessly” to help those affected.

Crews search for survivors after more than 160 injured at Jet Set in Santo Domingo

At least 58 people have died and 160 were injured in the Dominican capital early on Tuesday after the roof collapsed at a nightclub where politicians, athletes and others were attending a merengue concert, authorities said.

Crews were searching for survivors in the rubble at the one-storey Jet Set nightclub in Santo Domingo, said Juan Manuel Méndez, director of the Center of Emergency Operations.

“We presume that many of them are still alive, and that is why the authorities here will not give up until not a single person remains under that rubble,” he said.

Nearly 12 hours after the top of the nightclub collapsed on to patrons, rescue crews were still pulling out survivors from the debris. At the scene, firefighters removed blocks of broken concrete and sawed planks of wood, using them to lift heavy debris as the noise of drills filled the air.

The confirmed death toll had reached 44, Méndez said in the early afternoon. Earlier, officials had said there were at least 160 people injured.

Nelsy Cruz, the governor of the north-western province of Montecristi and sister of seven-time Major League Baseball All-Star Nelson Cruz, was among the victims.

She had called President Luis Abinader at 12.49am saying she was trapped and that the roof had collapsed, first lady Raquel Arbaje told reporters. Officials said Cruz died later at the hospital.

“This is too great a tragedy,” Arbaje said in a broken voice.

The Professional Baseball League of the Dominican Republic posted on X that MLB pitcher Octavio Dotel died. Officials had earlier rescued Dotel from the debris and taken him to a hospital.

Meanwhile, the injured included legislator Bray Vargas and merengue singer Rubby Pérez, who was performing when the roof collapsed, officials said.

His manager, Enrique Paulino, whose shirt was spattered with blood, told reporters at the scene that the concert began shortly before midnight, with the roof collapsing almost an hour later, killing the group's saxophonist.

“It happened so quickly. I managed to throw myself into a corner,” he said, adding that he initially thought it was an earthquake.

It wasn't immediately clear what caused the roof to collapse.

Jet Set issued a statement saying it was cooperating with authorities. “The loss of human life leaves us in a state of deep pain and dismay,” it said.

Manuel Olivo Ortiz, whose son attended the concert but did not return home, was among those anxiously waiting outside the club, which is known for its traditional parties where renowned national and international artists perform. “We're holding on only to God,” Olivo said.

Also awaiting word was Massiel Cuevas, godmother of 22-year-old Darlenys Batista. “I'm waiting for her. She's in there, I know she's in there,” Cuevas said, firm in her belief that Batista would be pulled out alive.

President Abinader wrote on X that all rescue agencies are “working tirelessly” to help those affected.

“We deeply regret the tragedy that occurred at the Jet Set nightclub. We have been following the incident minute by minute since it occurred,” he wrote.

Abinader arrived at the scene and hugged those looking for friends and family, some with tears streaming down their faces.

“We have faith in God that we will rescue even more people alive,” he told reporters.

An official with a megaphone stood outside the club imploring the large crowd that had gathered to search for friends and relatives to give ambulances space.

“You have to cooperate with authorities, please,” he said. “We are removing people.”

At one hospital where the injured were taken, an official stood outside reading aloud the names of survivors as a crowd gathered around her and yelled out the names of their loved ones.

Meanwhile, dozens of people gathered at the National Institute of Forensic Pathology, which projected pictures of the victims so their loved ones could identify them.

            Meghan, Duchess of Sussex has spoken about suffering from postpartum preeclampsia, calling the potentially fatal condition “so rare and so scary.”
    


            Speaking on the debut episode of her new podcast “Confessions of a Female Founder,” released Tuesday, Meghan described her experience of the condition, which is marked by elevated blood pressure and high levels of protein in the urine or other signs of organ damage.
    


            Meghan was speaking to her friend Whitney Wolfe Herd, founder of the Bumble dating app, who also experienced postpartum preeclampsia.
    


            “We both had very similar experiences — though we didn't know each other at the time — with postpartum and we both had preeclampsia. Postpartum preeclampsia,” said Meghan.
    


            “It's so rare and so scary,” she added.
    


            “And you're still trying to juggle all of these things, and the world doesn't know what's happening quietly,” said Meghan.
    


            “And in the quiet, you're still trying to show up for people… mostly for your children, but those things are huge medical scares.”
    


            Wolfe Herd agreed, saying: “I mean life or death, truly. It's like, really scary.”
    


            Most cases of postpartum preeclampsia develop within 48 hours of childbirth, but it can develop four to six weeks postpartum, according to the Mayo Clinic. Postpartum preeclampsia can cause seizures and other serious complications if left untreated.
    


            Meghan shares two children with her husband, Prince Harry. Archie was born in May 2019 and Lilibet was born two years later, after the couple stepped down as working royals.

            Meghan's new podcast is produced in partnership with Lemonada Media, which is home to Julia Louis-Dreyfus' podcast, “Wiser Than Me with Julia Louis-Dreyfus,” “Choice Words with Samantha Bee” and more.
    


            After moving to the United States in 2020, Harry and Meghan secured numerous media deals, including with Spotify and Netflix, the streaming home of their docuseries, “Harry & Meghan,” which chronicled their courtship, their relationship with the media and their decision to leave royal life.
    


            And in March, her new Netflix show “With Love, Meghan” was released on the streaming platform.
    


            Consisting of eight glossy episodes, each centered around Meghan hosting a different friend, it offers tips and tricks for being the ultimate hostess, cook and homemaker. Netflix confirmed to CNN last month that the show has been renewed for a second season and is set to premiere in the fall.

Pete Hildebrand says health secretary ‘never said anything' about vaccine's efficacy when he visited for funeral

A Texas man who buried his eight-year-old daughter on Sunday after the unvaccinated child died with measles says Robert F Kennedy Jr “never said anything” about the vaccine against the illness or its proven efficacy while visiting the girl's family and community for her funeral.

“He did not say that the vaccine was effective,” Pete Hildebrand, the father of Daisy Hildebrand, said in reference to Kennedy during a brief interview on Monday. “I had supper with the guy … and he never said anything about that.”

Hildebrand's remarks came in response to a question about the national health secretary's publicized visit to Daisy's funeral. It was also after Kennedy issued a statement in which he accurately said: “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,” which also provides protection against mumps and rubella.

Kennedy, an avowed vaccine skeptic helming the Trump administration's response to a measles outbreak that has been steadily growing across the US, then undermined that conventional messaging by soon publishing another statement that lavished praise on a pair of unconventional practitioners who have eschewed the two-dose MMR shot in favor of vitamins and cod liver oil.

The comments from Hildebrand provided a glimpse into how Kennedy simply demurred on vaccines – rather than express a position on them – during his first visit to the center of an outbreak that as of Monday had claimed three lives.

When asked for comment on Monday, Kennedy's Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) did not dispute Hildebrand's claims that the agency's leader was silent on Sunday about vaccines.

It instead provided a link to Kennedy's statement after the funeral, which read in part: “My intention was to come down here quietly to console the families and to be with [their] community in their moment of grief.”

Public health experts have repeatedly said the MMR vaccine is the best way to prevent deaths or serious illness from measles, a highly contagious respiratory disease.

Yet, during his brief interview on Monday, Hildebrand made clear that he stood by his skepticism of vaccines.

“I know it's not effective because some family members ended up getting the vaccine, and they got the measles way worse than some of my kids,” said Hildebrand, who is raising two other children with his wife, Eva. “The vaccine was not effective.”

Medical professionals have long established that getting an illness one was vaccinated against does not mean the vaccination failed. Vaccines also work by reducing the severity of illness – and, in some cases, can prevent death – should people catch the sickness they were immunized against.

Daisy Hildebrand died last week at University medical center in Lubbock, Texas, about 80 miles (129km) away from her family's home in the rural community of Seminole. Her doctors attributed her death to what they described as “measles pulmonary failure”, noting that she was not MMR-vaccinated and had no reported underlying conditions, according to a statement from Texas's state health services department.

She was the second young child from Seminole to die from measles in about five weeks. Kayley Fehr, who was also not given the MMR vaccine, died aged six in February after contracting measles and being hospitalized in Lubbock.

An unvaccinated adult in Lea county, New Mexico, also died after contracting the measles.

Fehr was the first person in the US to die from measles since 2015. Measles had been declared eliminated from the US in 2000, but it has recently been spreading in undervaccinated communities.

Funeral services for Hildebrand and Fehr were held in the same Mennonite church in Seminole, which has a population of about 7,000, according to publicly available information. Many Mennonite communities – which tend to be close-knit – have historically been undervaccinated as they prioritize what they interpret to be medical freedom over vaccine mandates.

Children who get the MMR vaccine are typically given the first dose at 12-15 months. They usually get the second dose between ages four and six.

Respectively, the shots are 93% and 97% effective, says the US Centers for Diseases Control.

The west Texas county to which Seminole belongs, Gaines, has one of the highest vaccine exemption rates in the state. Around the time of Hildebrand's death, it had reported about 300 measles cases since January. That was more than 65% of the nearly 500 measles cases which had then been reported in Texas.

As of Friday, the US government was reporting more than 605 measles cases across 22 states for the year so far. At least 74 of those cases – roughly 12% – had led to hospitalizations.

Kansas, Ohio and Oklahoma joined Texas as well as New Mexico in having active measles outbreaks, defined as three or more cases, officials said.

The US reported 285 measles cases in all of 2024.

Experts have warned that the US's collective outbreak could continue for several more months, if not for about a year. They have also said the US should prepare for more measles-related deaths without a more aggressive response.

The US Senate's health committee has summoned Kennedy to testify before the group on Thursday. Despite Kennedy's well-documented vaccine skepticism, the Senate voted 52-48 to confirm him as the national health secretary.

US president had said he would impose extra levies unless China withdrew its 34% retaliatory tariffs by today

Just to highlight that in that post on Truth Social regarding his call with South Korea's acting president, Trump said at the end that he is waiting for China to call to begin trade negotiations. Here's that part:

China also wants to make a deal, badly, but they don't know how to get it started. We are waiting for their call. It will happen! 

Back at Greer's Senate hearing, Greer says exemptions to Donald Trump's global tariffs are not expected in the near term.

The president has been clear, again, that he's not doing exemptions or exceptions in the near term.

Greer said that “Swiss cheese” in the process would undermine the goal of trade reciprocity.

The trade representative, who oversees the implementation of the tariffs, also said there is no particular timeline for trade negotiations.

Away from Greer's Senate hearing for a moment.

Mike Howell, the head of the conservative Heritage Foundation's so-called oversight project, is expected to advance an inflammatory conspiracy theory before the Senate judiciary committee that pardons signed by Joe Biden are invalid because they were signed by autopen.

The snipe will be targeted at Senator Adam Schiff, who received a pre-emptive pardon over his work on the House committee investigation into the January 6 Capitol riot that Howell will say is void, a person familiar with the matter said.

In alleging that Schiff's pardon is invalid, Howell would elevate a conspiracy theory that has taken hold in Maga circles that the former president was too mentally impaired to sign pardons himself and unaware of what documents he was endorsing.

The autopen feature uses a real pen to copy a person's actual signature. Presidents – including Trump – have used autopens for decades, and the justice department said in a memo two decades ago that presidents could direct an aide to “affix his signature” to bills.

But Howell, leaning into concerns about Biden's age and mental acuity, started a campaign last month to cast doubt on the legitimacy on the former president's executive actions.

After the Missouri attorney general questioned in a letter whether Biden had the capacity to sign pardons and executive orders, Howell seized on the matter and sparked a rightwing frenzy with a conspiratorial post on X: “Whoever controlled the autopen controlled the presidency.”

Howell is expected to fan the flames of the idea that a deep state cabal was secretly running the country instead of Biden before the Senate judiciary committee, during a hearing into the Freedom of Information Act.

But there is no evidence that Biden did not have the mental capacity to sign executive actions – or that they were not authorized.

Greer tells senators that China has not indicated that it wants to work toward trade reciprocity.

Unfortunately, China for many years seems to be choosing its own path on market access. They elected to announce retaliation, other countries did not. Other countries have signaled that they'd like to find a path toward reciprocity. China has not said that and we will see where that goes.

Greer he is due to have a call with his Indian counterpart to discuss India's “significant non-tariff barriers”.

Answering a question, Greer says, yes, he will try to include commitments on matters such as intellectual property, technical barriers to trade and science-based agricultural rules in his talks with India.

Greer says the administration is seeking more market access in Japan regarding agriculture and in terms of “structural impediments to some [US] industrial goods in terms of standards and regulations”.

Greer says nearly 50 countries, including Argentina, India, Vietnam and Israel, have approached him personally to discuss Trump's tariffs policy and start negotiations to reduce their tariffs on the US.

US trade representative Jamieson Greer has been testifying on Donald Trump's trade and tariff policies before the Senate finance committee.

Greer said Trump imposed tariffs to address the “emergency” of the “massive” US trade deficit. He calls the deficit “an economic and national security emergency”, adding: “We can't ignore it.”

He cited “higher tariffs imposed by other countries on the US, as well as the effect of [there's that phrase again] non-tariff measures that promote other countries' exports and obstruct US exports, and other foreign economic policies favoring over-production and degrading America's manufacturing capacity”.

He said it was “common sense” to focus on these “indicators” of “non-reciprocal trading conditions”.

As an example he cited trade in shellfish with the EU. “The EU can sell us all the shellfish they want,” he says, “but the EU bans shellfish from 48 states. The result is a trade deficit in shellfish with the EU”

An update from Reuters on the Saudi foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud's visit to Washington today – the official visit is aimed at planning Donald Trump's expected trip to the kingdom later this spring, a source close to the Saudi royal court told the news agency.

Prince Faisal would also discuss Gaza and the status of Yemen's Houthis during meetings with US government officials, the source said.

The trip was scheduled before last week's US tariffs announcement, the source added.

Reuters reports that Trump plans to visit Saudi Arabia as early as May to sign an investment agreement in what will be the first foreign trip of his second term, with stops also planned in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

Trump made Saudi Arabia and Israel the initial stops on his inaugural foreign trip during his first term in 2017.

In a meeting with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Monday, Trump once again raised his highly controversial proposal for the US to take control of Gaza. The plan has been globally condemned, including by Saudi Arabia.

In Yemen, which borders Saudi Arabia to the south, the US has launched airstrikes against the Iran-aligned Houthis in an effort to force an end to the group's attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. The airstrikes are the biggest US military operation in the Middle East since Trump took office in January.

Donald Trump will sign executive orders on Tuesday to boost the coal industry, a senior White House official and two sources told Reuters, in his latest action that runs counter to global efforts to curb carbon emissions.

Trump campaigned on a promise to increase US energy output and has sought to roll back energy and environmental regulations since taking office in January.

He is scheduled to sign energy related orders at the White House at 3pm ET, the White House said.

The actions will also include efforts to save coal plants that were likely to be retired, said the sources close to the matter, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The orders will direct energy secretary Chris Wright to determine whether coal used in the production of steel is a “critical mineral” the White House official said.

It also directs interior secretary Doug Burgum to acknowledge the end of of a moratorium that paused coal leasing on federal lands and to prioritize coal leasing.

Just to highlight that in that post on Truth Social regarding his call with South Korea's acting president, Trump said at the end that he is waiting for China to call to begin trade negotiations. Here's that part:

China also wants to make a deal, badly, but they don't know how to get it started. We are waiting for their call. It will happen! 

Stocks are surging on Wall Street at the start of trading.

The S&P 500 share index has jumped by 3.3% as investors pile into stocks, up 169 points at 5,232 points.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 large US companies, has surged by 1,380 points, or 3.6%, to 39,346 points. The tech-focused Nasdaq index jumped 3.7%.

Shares are rallying after US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent said that he believes the US can reach “some good deals” with trading partners.

This will bring some relief to stock holders, after the sharp plunge in share values on Thursday and Friday last week.

That follows a wild day's trading yesterday, in which the Dow ended up down 0.9% while the S&P 500 dropped 0.2% for the day. The Nasdaq was 0.1% up.

Traders appear to be hoping that some of the tariffs announced by Donald Trump last week will be negotiated away, as some countries call the White House to agree talks.

However, as Donald Trump just posted, he is still waiting for the phone to ring from Beijing.

We haven't yet had South Korea's acting president Han Duck-soo's take on the call, but we have heard from Donald Trump, who has said the call was “great” and that the two leaders discussed tariffs, shipbuilding and potential energy deals as well as other subjects not related to trade and tariffs.

“We have the confines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries. Their top TEAM is on a plane heading to the US, and things are looking good,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform, reiterating that South Korea's trade minister was on his way to the US to meet with his counterpart for negotiations over tariffs.

Trump said they discussed “tariffs, shipbuilding, large-scale purchase of US LNG and South Korea's joint venture [with Japan] in an Alaska pipeline” (Bloomberg – paywall – has more on that).

Away from trade and returning to this theme of qualms he has with so-called “non-monetary tariffs” – or, as he puts it here, negotiating “subjects that are not covered by trade and tariffs”, Trump said the two leaders also discussed payment for US military protection.

Here's the full post:

I just had a great call with the Acting President of South Korea. We talked about their tremendous and unsustainable Surplus, Tariffs, Shipbuilding, large scale purchase of U.S. LNG, their joint venture in an Alaska Pipeline, and payment for the big time Military Protection we provide to South Korea. They began these Military payments during my first term, Billions of Dollars, but Sleepy Joe Biden, for reasons unknown, terminated the deal. That was a shocker to all! In any event, we have the confines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries. Their top TEAM is on a plane heading to the U.S., and things are looking good. We are likewise dealing with many other countries, all of whom want to make a deal with the United States. Like with South Korea, we are bringing up other subjects that are not covered by Trade and Tariffs, and getting them negotiated also. “ONE STOP SHOPPING” is a beautiful and efficient process!!! China also wants to make a deal, badly, but they don't know how to get it started. We are waiting for their call. It will happen! GOD BLESS THE USA.

South Korea's acting president Han Duck-soo has spoken with Donald Trump over the phone, a day before Trump's 25% tariff is scheduled to kick in.

Han vowed an “all-out” response as Asia's fourth-biggest economy reeled from Thursday's announcement of 25% tariffs on its exports to the US, with its auto industry expected to be hit particularly hard. He said on Thursday:

As the situation is very grave with the approach of the reality of a global tariff war, the government must pour out all of its capabilities at its disposal to overcome this trade crisis.

It is the first time Trump spoke with any of South Korea's acting leaders since he took office in January, while now-impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol, with whom Trump had a phone call the day after his election victory last November, was suspended from duties.

The phone call between Han and Trump also comes as South Korea's trade minister is traveling to the US to meet with his counterpart for negotiations over tariffs.

Cheong In-kyo, who will meet US trade representative Jamieson Greer during the visit, said on Tuesday that the government has been considering measures to increase imports from the US.

Cheong also said it was good news ahead of his visit that Trump said the door was open for talks over tariffs with nations other than China. (When Trump announced his additional 50% tariff threat on Monday he said all talks with China had been terminated, but later seemed to contradict himself by saying: “We'll be talking to China.”)

“It is difficult to reduce exports, so shouldn't we then increase [US] imports? In that regard, we have been reviewing many different packages of measures to resolve the trade balance problem,” Cheong said, before flying to Washington.

He noted that the government had had internal discussions about increasing LNG imports from the US.

Cheong added he will dispute Washington's calculation of its 25% tariff on South Korea, which he called “problematic” given the two countries' existing free trade pact.

Trump also announced a 46% duty for Vietnam, where major South Korean conglomerates like Samsung and LG manufacture products. That will deal a “huge blow” to South Korean exporters with production bases there, finance minister Choi Sang-mok said on Tuesday.

Saudi Arabia's foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud landed in the United States on Tuesday, an official source told Reuters.

He was part of the Saudi delegation that hosted and facilitated talks between the US and Russia in Riyadh in February. We'll bring you more on his visit as we get it.

Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem has issued a federal notice that she is waiving a slew of environmental and historical preservation laws to facilitate the construction of a barrier wall and roads in the San Diego area, citing illegal border crossings and drug trafficking, reports Law360.

In a notice of determination to be published on Tuesday in the Federal Register, Noem cited the department's mission to secure US borders and prevent illegal entry into the country as she announced that laws including the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act will be waived to accommodate the construction work.

It mirror's Department of Homeland Security policy during the first Trump administration that waived environmental laws and other regulations to “ensure the expeditious construction of barriers and roads” near the US-Mexico border south of San Diego “to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the United States”. Then, as now, the move stemmed from a Donald Trump executive order to move forward with building his border wall.

Trump's 20 January “Securing Our Borders” executive order was mentioned in the notice, as was a congressional mandate in the Secure Fence Act of 2006, both of which authorize the DHS secretary to maintain operational control of the international land border.

Congress in the Secure Fence Act defines “operational control” as the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists and other unlawful aliens, as well as the illegal introduction of narcotics and other contraband into the country, Noem's notice said.

Trump's order has directed Noem to take all appropriate action “to deploy and construct physical barriers to ensure complete operational control of the southern border of the United States”, according to Noem.

She said the US border patrol San Diego sector is an area of high illegal entry of people and narcotics.

“Everything is on the table,” Bessent said when asked whether the European Union needed to lower non-tariff barriers including value-added taxes (VAT).

Everything is on the table. The academic literature shows that it's actually the non-tariff barriers which are harder, both harder to quantify and … they're more insidious because they're hidden, they're obfuscated.

His reference to “non-tariff barriers” mirrors Donald Trump's comments from the Oval Office yesterday about his qualms with “non-monetary tariffs” regarding the EU, but he was less vague than Bessent, suggesting that EU standards, rules and regulations were “non-monetary barriers” for US companies trying to trade with the bloc.

“It's not only tariffs, it's non-monetary tariffs. It's tariffs where they put things on that make it impossible for you to sell a car. It's not a money thing. They make it so difficult – the standards and the tests,” Trump said.

“So they come up with rules and regulations that are just designed for one reason: that you can't sell your product in those countries and we're not going to let that happen. Those are called non-monetary barriers,” he said.

US treasury secretary Scott Bessent has been on the airwaves this morning, telling CNBC that “China's escalation is a big mistake” and insisting that the US has the upper hand in the trade war brewing between Washington and Beijing.

I think it was a big mistake, this Chinese escalation. We are the deficit country. So what do we lose by the Chinese raising tariffs on us? We export one fifth to them of what they export to us. So that is a losing hand for them.

Yesterday Donald Trump threatened China with an additional 50% tariff (on top of the 20% and 34% he previously announced) if it did not withdraw its retaliatory levies – due to take effect tomorrow.

Bessent's language echoes that of China's commerce ministry, which last night rejected Trump's threats as a “mistake on top of a mistake” and accused the US of “blackmail”. It vowed to “resolutely take countermeasures”, adding:

China will fight to the end if the US side is bent on going down the wrong path.

Bessent also claimed that US tariff negotiations are the result of calls from other countries and not sliding financial markets.

About 70 countries have reached out to the White House to begin talks, Bessent said, adding that Trump will be personally involved in trade negotiations.

President Donald Trump will sign executive orders on Tuesday aimed at boosting the nation's coal industry, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Trump, who campaigned on a promise to increase US energy production and has sought to roll back a wide range of energy and environmental regulations since taking office 20 January, is scheduled to sign energy-related orders at the White House at 3pm, the White House said.

Trump plans to sign several executive orders directing the Interior and Energy Departments to take actions to support the industry, according to a source briefed on the details of the event. Both sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The actions will also include efforts to save coal plants at risk of retirement, the source said.

Beijing accuses US of blackmail and adding a ‘mistake on top of a mistake' as Wednesday deadline for latest levies looms

China's government says it will “fight to the end” if the US continues to escalate the trade war, after Donald Trump threatened huge additional tariffs in response to China's retaliatory measures.

On Tuesday, China's commerce ministry accused the US of “blackmail” and said the US president's threats of additional 50% tariffs if Beijing did not reverse its own 34% reciprocal tariff were a “mistake on top of a mistake”.

It vowed to “resolutely take countermeasures”, adding: “China will fight to the end if the US side is bent on going down the wrong path.”

On Tuesday Asian markets appeared to improve slightly in early trading, a day after torrid day on the global markets that prompted the billionaire investor Bill Ackman, one of the US president's backers in the 2024 race for the White House, to call for a moratorium.

Tuesday's response from Beijing is the latest in a worsening tit-for-tat between the two countries. Last week Trump announced a swathe of tariffs ranging from 10%-50% against US trading partners to come into effect this Wednesday. He placed a 34% tariff on imports from China – in addition to a previous 20% levy. Beijing then retaliated with a reciprocal 34% tariff on all US imports. That prompted Trump on Monday to threaten an additional 50% tariff on to Chinese imports if Beijing did not reverse theirs.

“If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose additional tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!”

A scathing editorial in Chinese official state news outlet Xinhua accused Trump of “naked extortion”.

“Utterly absurd is the underlying logic of the United States: ‘I can hit you at my will, and you must not respond. Instead, you must surrender unconditionally',” it said. “This is not diplomacy. It is blunt coercion dressed up as policy.”

On social media a 1987 speech by then US president Ronald Reagan posted by China's foreign ministry has been widely shared. The video clip, in which Reagan criticises the use of tariffs as leading to retaliation and ultimately hurting the US economy, “has a new meaning in 2025”, China's The Paper said.

Wen-ti Sung, a non-resident fellow with the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub said the US and China were “locked in a game of chicken”. “Like two race cars driving directly toward each other, whoever swerves first will stand to lose prestige and profit,” Sung told the Guardian.

“China seems determined to signal that the world is still bipolar, and that Beijing will not let Washington get to call the shots, lest it sets the tone for the years to come. Plus China is still waiting to get more assurance from Trump that if it accommodates Trump's demand will it get China out of his crosshairs or whether it will only whet his appetite more.

“If not, China's main option is to respond with proportional retaliatory trade sanctions against the US, while trying to negotiate with Washington at the same time.”

On Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei index rose 6%, rebounding from an 18-month low on Monday, after Trump and Japanese prime minister Shigeru Ishiba agreed to open trade talks in a phone call late on Monday.

Chinese blue-chips climbed 0.7%, recouping a fraction of the more than 7% slide on Monday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 2% after suffering the worst day since 1997. US stock futures also pointed higher after a rollercoaster session in which it touched its lowest level in more than a year.

Trump's “liberation day” tariffs targeted dozens of countries, and China is not the only one to respond. The European Commission has proposed counter-tariffs of 25% on a range of US goods, including soybeans, nuts and sausages, while saying they stood ready to negotiate a “zero for zero” deal with Trump.

EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said at a news conference: “Sooner or later, we will sit at the negotiation table with the US and find a mutually acceptable compromise.”

The 27-member EU, which had already been hit with tariffs on vehicles and metals, faces another 20% on other items from Wednesday. Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on alcoholic drinks from the bloc.

Taiwan, which faces a 32% reciprocal tariff and saw its worst ever market fall on Monday, has said it is ready to negotiate “at any time”, with president Lai Ching-te proposing a zero-tariffs agreement, removal of trade barriers, and increased investment in the US.

Taiwan has repeatedly said its large trade surplus with the US is due to the US's soaring demand for tech, given its companies are major suppliers to companies such as Apple and Nvidia.

            President Donald Trump said Monday that direct talks are underway between the United States and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program.
    


            Speaking alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, Trump said a “very big meeting” would take place Saturday. Trump declined to give further details about the meeting beyond saying it would be “at top level.”
    


            “I think everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious,” Trump said.
    


            US officials are expected to sit down with Iranian officials to directly discuss a nuclear deal on Saturday in a meeting hosted by Oman, a person familiar with the plans confirmed to CNN later Monday.
    


            But the source could not say who would participate and at what level. Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, is believed to be handling the Iran file.
    


            Early Tuesday local time, the semi-official Iranian news outlet Tasnim reported that Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi will begin indirect talks with Witkoff in Oman on Saturday.
    


            Araghchi said Monday on X that the US and Iran will hold “indirect high-level” talks in Oman. “It is as much an opportunity as it is a test. The ball is in America's court,” the foreign minister said.
    


            Direct talks between the US and Iran could represent a blow to Israel, which has long advocated for striking Iran's nuclear facilities. Trump has indicated a preference for negotiating over Iran's nuclear program.
    


            Iran had previously rejected Trump's offer of direct negotiations over its nuclear program, offering instead to engage in indirect talks. Trump's offer, which he sent to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in March, proposed negotiations on a new nuclear deal, with a two-month ultimatum to reach an agreement, a source familiar with the letter's contents previously told CNN.
    


            “We don't avoid talks; it's the breach of promises that has caused issues for us so far,” Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in televised remarks last month when he rejected direct negotiations. “They must prove that they can build trust.”
    


            The Iranian mission to the UN declined to comment when asked about direct talks or the meeting that Trump announced.
    


            The last direct senior-level talks between the US and Iran were a decade ago, in 2015, as then-US Secretary of State John Kerry and then-Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif worked to finalize the Iran nuclear deal.
    


            Trump on Monday voiced optimism that talks would be successful in convincing Iran to abandon its nuclear program, which Tehran insists is for peaceful purposes.
    


            “Hopefully those talks will be successful. And I think it would be in Iran's best interests if they are successful. … We hope that's going to happen,” he said.
    


            “If the talks aren't successful with Iran, I think Iran is going to be in great danger,” Trump warned.
    


            Both Israel and the US have vowed they will never let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon.
    


            In December, United Nations nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi told Reuters that Iran is “dramatically” accelerating its enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, closer to the roughly 90% level that is weapons grade. In January, Grossi again warned that Iran is “pressing the gas pedal” on its uranium enrichment.
    


            The US been sending more military assets to the Middle East as tensions in the region continue to flare.
    


            The Trump administration began ramping up military action against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen in mid-March, with airstrikes that killed at least 53 people and wounded almost 100 others, according to the Houthi-run Health Ministry.
    


            Last week, CNN reported the total cost of the US' military action against the Houthis was nearing $1 billion in just under three weeks, even as the attacks have had limited impact on destroying the terror group's capabilities, three people briefed on the campaign's progress told CNN.
    


            The military offensive has already used hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of munitions for strikes against the group, including JASSM long-range cruise missiles; JSOWs, which are GPS-guided glide bombs; and Tomahawk missiles, the sources said.

Community-based approach in England has had good results so far in cutting urgent demand for GPs and A&E

The NHS is attempting to ease the pressure on GPs and A&E by sending a new type of health worker door to door in deprived areas to help detect illnesses before people need urgent care.

Community health and wellbeing workers (CHWW) are already deployed in 12 areas of England, with 13 others to follow, in an attempt to improve poor and vulnerable people's access to care.

Each worker is responsible for 120-150 households, usually on a council estate, which they visit once a month to help residents with money, isolation and housing problems, as well as their health.

Wes Streeting, the heath secretary, is examining the scheme as he pulls together ideas to help “fix” the NHS that may be included in the forthcoming 10-year health plan.

GPs and other advocates of deploying community health and wellbeing workers believe they can help Streeting achieve two of the “three big shifts” in healthcare he has promised: moving care from hospitals into the community and making the NHS a prevention rather than treatment service.

People who are visited by such workers seek help at A&E 10% less often than they did previously and seek unplanned GP appointments for unexpected medical problems 7.3% less than before, according to the National Association of Primary Care (NAPC), which is championing their use.

Evidence from the borough of Westminster in London, which became the first place to use community health and wellbeing workers in 2021, showed that people in the households they help are:

82% more likely to attend a cancer screening.

47% more likely to get vaccinated against major diseases.

82% more likely to undergo an NHS health check.

Cornwall adopted the approach in 2023. Findings from there showed that taking health support to people in such a proactive way has reduced demand for mental health care and community services, as well as reducing the need for visits by district nurses or an urgent care response team.

Community health and wellbeing workers are not clinically trained staff, like doctors, nurses and health visitors. They are mostly recruited from the communities they work in and trained up for the role.

Cornwall's NHS integrated care board has handed Volunteer Cornwall, a Truro-based charity, a contract to provide the service. It now employs 60 such workers.

But in other places in England, community health and wellbeing workers work for individual GP surgeries or small groups of them.

Marcus McAlister, the NAPC's programme manager, said those helped by the scheme attend A&E less because they get help for minor infections, mental health problems and flare-ups of diabetes and high blood pressure from community-based services.

“CHWWs are supporting residents to access earlier and more appropriate forms of care, often in community settings,” he said.

“They're also helping to address wider determinants of health – like housing, finances and loneliness – which are frequently the root cause of escalating health issues that end up in A&E.”

Their job is to build relationships with the people in their households and with health professionals and NHS services locally, he added.

Sarah Woolnough, the chief executive of the King's Fund thinktank, said: “I recently visited a pilot of this innovative approach, and it exemplifies how the health service can transition from merely treating sickness to actively preventing it.

“By visiting people in their homes, healthcare workers can see all the factors driving a person's health, not just the symptoms they might disclose during a GP appointment, but also underlying issues such as mouldy housing, debt and unemployment.

“This method could be particularly effective for those requiring support from multiple services, as it ensures a more coordinated and well-rounded approach to their care.”

Streeting said: “We're seeing some really encouraging signs about what can happen if you've got the right care in the right place at the right time, especially among communities and families where they're likely to become what I call ‘the frequent flyers of the NHS'.”

I write to bear witness to the incredible nature of these men – to their kindness, their gentleness and their goodness

When the initial news of the executions of eight paramedics from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and the disappearance of one more broke on Eid al-Fitr, I stared for a long time at the pictures of the men the Israel Defense Forces had killed. I have stared more every day since.

I knew some of these men.

I scan photos of my time in Gaza last year, looking for these men in my memories. I see them with patients, kneeling by the stretchers that acted as beds, dressing wounds, talking, reassuring. I see them loading patients into ambulances and driving off in the summer dust. I see them laughing, playing soccer on the tennis court.

Eight Palestinian paramedics, working under the auspices of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and with the full protection of their emblem, were killed by the Israel Defense Forces, in blatant violation of international humanitarian law, and indeed of the most basic sense of being human. They were killed and buried alongside six first responders from Gaza's civil defence unit and a United Nations employee.

In April 2024 I was part of an emergency medical team delivering medical care in Gaza. At the request of the World Health Organization, our team worked with the PRCS at a trauma stabilisation point. What an honour that was. On a tennis court in Khan Younis, we worked from two tents – one for the PRCS and one for us – collaborating frequently and freely. We saw patients, treating those we could, and stabilising and referring elsewhere those we could not. Paramedics brought patients directly from places of frontline trauma and when stable they loaded them back in the ambulances and took them to where they hoped they could receive the care they needed. The PRCS clinicians I worked with in Khan Younis took far greater risks than any I have faced in a decade of work in conflict to provide life-saving medical care to their compatriots.

Returning home last year I wrote in the Guardian that “Israel poses a palpable, unprecedented risk to humanitarian and medical workers in Gaza”. The latest update from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports that since October 2023 at least 409 humanitarian workers have been killed in Gaza, and the number keeps rising. Australian aid worker Zomi Frankcom was one of them. The anniversary of her death passed just days ago, and indeed far too quietly.

Medical humanitarian work, to me, is about both contributing to access to healthcare for people in areas of great need, as well as bearing witness to their suffering, in whatever is the manner required by the moment. In this moment I write to bear witness but not to the suffering of the Palestinian Red Crescent medical staff, for that you can read about yourself. Indeed, if you have not seen the egregious violence of Israel against healthcare workers and civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, you are not looking. No, I write to bear witness to the incredible nature of these men – to their love, their kindness, their gentleness and their goodness. We stop seeing people's humanity very quickly in war of any description, and even more so in mass slaughter or indeed genocide. Erasure requires such forgetting.

I watched the men of the PRCS work hard and effectively. I sat with them between patients, listening to lyrical conversation and wondering at their upbeat spirts. In more private candid moments they would explain, what choice did they have? They needed to stay positive enough to be upright each day, to continue the work. They were tired, they were scared, but they continued.

We ate together. In the middle of a conflict zone with the austerity that resulted from Israel's systematic blockades of supplies into Gaza, our colleagues in the PRCS fed us each day from their own kitchens. The people of the PRCS seem to give of an inexhaustible supply of goodness of their own selves.

Many of us engaged in medical humanitarian work are currently drowning in grief, in anger and in concern for any possibility of work in conflict going forward.  Experienced humanitarian workers know that the deaths of our colleagues are not collateral damage from the routine business of war. War might have been foggy in the 19th century, but I can assure you it is not in the 21st. Israel has demonstrated its exceptional capacity for precision targeting. None with any power among us can afford to wait for a belated international criminal court or International Court of Justice process to say what we see with our own eyes. States must acknowledge the violations of the laws of war that Israel continues to perpetrate, and they must act accordingly.

A former-ICRC friend wrote on Instagram that “grief has lost its meaning”. We are all at a loss for words. Another wrote to me that “it is a huge challenge to honour their lives properly”. As I struggle to type, pulling words like teeth without anaesthetic, I feel the words of my friends with my soul and sinew. I can't meet the challenge. Nothing I can say can ever adequately honour the men of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. Instead, I write in sadness for the record.

Extreme volatility has plagued global stock markets, with Donald Trump defying stark warnings about economic damage – key US politics stories from 7 April 

Global stock markets fell catastrophically on Monday following President Trump's tariff rollout.

Despite the economic turmoil, the US president doubled down on his plan, threatening to impose an additional 50% tariff on imports from China on Wednesday, unless the country rescinds its retaliatory tariffs on the United States by Tuesday.

Trump has defended his sweeping tariffs, saying: “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something”. Top officials in the administration have brushed aside fears of a recession and reiterated the tariff policy will be implemented as planned.

Here are the key stories at a glance:

Extreme volatility plagued global stock markets on Monday, with Wall Street swinging in and out of the red as Donald Trump defied stark warnings that his global trade assault will wreak widespread economic damage, comparing new US tariffs to medicine.

A renewed sell-off began in Asia, before hitting European equities and reaching the US. It was briefly reversed amid hopes of a reprieve, only for Trump to threaten China with more steep tariffs, intensifying pressure on the market.

The EU has said it offered the US a “zero-for-zero” tariff deal on cars and industrial goods weeks before Donald Trump launched his trade war, but that it would not wait to defend itself. Maros Šefčovič, the EU commissioner for trade, said he had proposed zero tariffs on cars and a range of industrial goods, such as pharmaceutical products, rubber and machinery on 19 February.

He said the EU and US were in early stages of talks while EU commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the offer remained on the table. However, later on Monday Trump appeared to quash any such discussions, telling reporters zero-zero tariffs were not on the cards.

Donald Trump has announced that the US is to hold direct talks with Iran in a bid to prevent the country from obtaining an atomic bomb, while also warning Tehran of dire consequences if they fail.

He said the talks were happening in an effort to avoid what he called “the obvious” – an apparent reference to US or Israeli military strikes against the regime's nuclear facilities.

Billionaire fund manager tries to persuade US president over tariffs, which have wiped $6tn off US stocks

Donald Trump supporter and billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman has said the president is losing the confidence of business leaders and should pause his trade war – which could cause an economic collapse while damaging his supporters the most.

“The president has an opportunity to call a 90-day time out,” Ackman said on Sunday in a post on X, to resolve trade issues via negotiation.

“If, on the other hand ... we launch economic nuclear war on every country in the world, business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate.”

Though Trump made imposing tariffs a part of his victorious 2024 electoral campaign, which Ackman endorsed, the billionaire fund manager's X post said: “This is not what we voted for.”

Ackman's post came after Trump's tariffs wiped $6tn off US stocks. Asia and Europe's markets slumped, too.

The Trump tariffs are 10% across the board, with higher rates aimed at about 60 countries.

Late Sunday on Air Force One, Trump told reporters he had spent the weekend speaking to leaders from Europe and Asia who tried to convince him to lower his tariffs – some that are as high as 50% and are due to take effect this week.

But Trump said that those counties would need to pay “a lot of money on a yearly basis” for him to reconsider.

In his post, Ackman also said: “By placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and our enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war against the whole world at once, we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital.”

Staying the course would mean “heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter, and we should start hunkering down”, Ackman's post also said. “May cooler heads prevail.”

There were no immediate indications that pleas such as Ackman's would persuade Trump. During his Air Force One talk with reporters on Sunday, he said: “I don't want anything to go down. But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”

Tuesday is the first of three days of industrial action being taken by public sector doctors in NSW

Orhan Karakaya has been in and out of hospital his entire adult life because of ulcerative colitis.

Never in that time has he seen New South Wales doctors take strike action, but with a drip in his arm, Karakaya came out to support the rally outside Westmead hospital.

Tuesday was the first of three days of industrial action being taken by public sector doctors in NSW, who say they have the worst wages and working conditions of doctors anywhere in the country.

“I think it's a ridiculous joke they're having to be here and strike. They don't want to strike, they want to care for us,” Karakaya said.

“They need to be respected not only in their job, but in their pay. They do a wonderful job. I can't speak highly enough about the good service.”

The doctors' union, the Australian Salaried Medical Officers' Federation (Asmof), said patient safety would not be compromised during the action, with emergency departments and critical care units to remain safely staffed, and only non-urgent procedures postponed.

Asmof's president, Dr Nicholas Spooner, said: “Doctors are not asking for the world. We're asking for safe working hours, a minimum 10-hour break between shifts, and proper staffing so people don't have to wait hours to see a doctor in emergency.”

On Tuesday afternoon, the NSW health minister, Ryan Park, said the state was “seeing impacts across the board”.

He said that as a result of the first six hours of the industrial action, 372 elective surgeries had been cancelled and 21 beds closed in hospitals. Of the beds closed, 20 were short-stay beds in emergency departments. There were also 3,020 outpatient clinics and services cancelled, including 486 chemotherapy appointments, Park said.

The government estimated about 3,500 doctors had taken industrial action on Tuesday, a number Park said was likely to fluctuate over different shifts in coming days.

The NSW health deputy secretary, Matthew Daly, said that after Asmof provided the government with more information about its industrial plans, he was “feeling a high level of confidence about maintaining safe and accessible services”.

The union had ensured that public holiday staffing levels were maintained as a minimum, which Asmof councillor Dr Tom Morrison said meant the number of doctors rostered on emergency and intensive care remained the same, but there were fewer rostered on wards.

NSW Health's up-to-date emergency department data showed performance over the 90% benchmark, but Daly noted that this could deteriorate.

Ian Lisser, Asmof NSW's manager of industrial services, said the response and turn out members was tremendous – “far, far exceeding our expectations”.

“Last week, we had 5,000 members confirmed taking industrial action. That figure has blown out to 7,000 after NSW Health sent out its heavy-handed threatening emails.”

Not all of the more than 7,000 doctors participating in the action across the three days will walk off the job, with numbers limited based on the union's discussions with senior staff within each hospital's departments about what action could be taken without compromising patient safety.

Dr Lucy Bates, a uro-gynaecologist for western Sydney local health district, said she was striking for safe working hours as “my children don't get to see me”.

“They can go days without seeing me because of the hours that we're putting in,” Bates said.

“I'm also striking to try to keep the good people in the health system; we are burned out, walking out because we're not getting enough support.”

According to the union, doctors were striking in response to chronic doctor shortages across NSW hospitals, unsafe hours (including widespread 16-hour back-to-back shifts), fatigue and burnout, leading to staff resignations and poor retention, with NSW doctors leaving for significantly better conditions interstate and a lack of genuine negotiation with the government.

The union said better working conditions could attract more staff and rosters could be better filled with safe working hours.

Doctors are demanding a 30% pay increase over a “reasonable” period of time to bring their pay into line with other states.

The Minns government has offered a 10.5% increase over three years, but it has acknowledged doctors – like all public sector workers – have suffered “wage suppression” because of the previous Coalition government's wage cap.

Asmof has proceeded with the industrial action in defiance of orders from the Industrial Relations Commission to refrain from doing so.

Park said the government had offered on Monday to give junior doctors a separate pay increase as quickly as possible, noting the pay gap for workers “not on significantly high wages” with counterparts in other states.

NSW junior doctors are paid $78,000 annually – $12,000 less than what they could earn in Queensland's public system.

But Park said the union did not want to separate junior and senior pay.

Dr Mark Priestley told the Westmead rally on Tuesday: “We're here because we want to see total award reform.”

“We're here because we want to be here for our patients.

“I'm very proud of my colleagues, not just for being here today, but for staying in the public health system.”

Doctors are walking out, he said, because they have been in discussions with the government for more than a year without seeing meaningful award reform.

Priestley said doctors were asking for “simple conditions”, such as obstetricians being paid for coming in after hours to deliver a baby.

“We want simple things that any man in the street, any patient, would expect – and [that] exist in other states.”

Dr Zachary McPherson, a paediatrician and Asmof member, said there were huge vacancy and resourcing issues. He said waiting lists in “fully staffed” departments stretch into the years because there had been no change in staff numbers despite significant population growth.

            The National Park Service on Monday returned an image of and quote from Harriet Tubman to a webpage about the Underground Railroad, following backlash after her presence on the page was dramatically reduced.
    


            The agency said the reduced mention of Tubman had been made without approval by top leadership.
    


            Until mid-February, the top of the NPS' “What is the Underground Railroad?” page featured a large photo of Tubman, the railroad's most famous “conductor,” records from the Wayback Machine show. Next to it was a quote from Tubman about her experience coordinating the clandestine network for slaves seeking freedom.

            But sometime in February it was changed, swapping the large image of Tubman for small commemorative stamps of five abolitionists – among them Tubman – a screen grab from the webpage on March 19 captured by the Wayback Machine shows. Text on the stamps touted “Black/White Cooperation.” Tubman's quote was removed and the text amended significantly in the updated version.
    


            The Washington Post first reported on the change Sunday, which prompted backlash from historians and educators.
    


            Asked about the restoration of Tubman's image and quote to the page, an NPS spokesperson told CNN, “Changes to the Underground Railroad page on the National Park Service's website were made without approval from NPS leadership nor Department leadership. The webpage was immediately restored to its original content.”
    


            The edited version – without Tubman's quote or image – had been live since at least February 21, the Wayback Machine shows.
    


            The edited webpage featured revised text that did not mention slavery until the third paragraph and cut a reference to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 entirely. The edited article had swapped a description of enslaved peoples' efforts to free themselves with two paragraphs that emphasized the “American ideals of liberty and freedom.”
    


            The recent reduction of Tubman's presence on the webpage, coming after several other prominent changes to government websites as the administration enacts a sweeping anti-DEI agenda, incurred criticism from some who said the change minimized Tubman's crucial contributions to the Underground Railroad. The abolitionist is credited with helping free scores of enslaved people during the Civil War period.
    


            One historian, Fergus Bordewich, had called the edits “both offensive and absurd” in an interview with CNN.
    


            Before the page was reverted Monday afternoon, an NPS spokesperson defended the changes, telling CNN “the idea that a couple web edits somehow invalidate the National Park Service's commitment to telling complex and challenging historical narratives is completely false and belies the extensive websites, social media posts, and programs we offer about Harriet Tubman specifically and Black History as a whole.”
    


            The spokesperson highlighted the two national historical parks named for Tubman.
    


            “The National Park Service recognizes Harriet Tubman as the Underground Railroad's best known conductor and we celebrate her as a deeply spiritual woman who lived her ideals and dedicated her life to freedom,” the NPS said.
    


            There is a separate National Park Service page dedicated to Tubman, who was born into slavery in Maryland before fleeing to Philadelphia. She returned to Maryland over a dozen times to help free other slaves, guiding them through the “Underground Railroad,” a secret network of routes and safe houses. The park service webpage on Tubman does not seem to have been changed since January 28, 2025.

            Lori Vallow Daybell, who was convicted of killing her two youngest children and conspiring to murder a romantic rival, is on trial again Monday. This time, she's accused in Arizona of conspiring to murder her estranged husband.
    


            In opening statements the prosecution said that Vallow Daybell conspired with brother Alex Cox to kill Charles Vallow and cash in on a life insurance policy, while espousing the belief that Charles was possessed by an evil spirit.
    


            The case has drawn significant public attention in part because Vallow Daybell, 51, has doomsday-focused religious beliefs. She isn't a lawyer but has chosen to represent herself in the six-week trial.
    


            Vallow Daybell has pleaded not guilty and said in her opening statement that Cox acted in self-defense after Charles attacked her daughter with a baseball bat, describing the death as a tragedy but not a crime.
    


            Here's what to know about the case.
    


            “Lori Vallow is why Alex was able to shoot Charles,” prosecutor Treena Kay said. “Lori Vallow is why Charles is dead.”
    


            A jury of 16 took their seats in a Phoenix courtroom, including four alternate jurors. Kay provided a detailed timeline and argued that phone records, witness testimony and forensic evidence will show that Cox's shooting of Charles was “not self-defense.”
    


            The prosecution also said Monday that Vallow Daybell conspired in the killing so that she could move forward with marrying her then-boyfriend Chad Daybell, an Idaho author who wrote several religious novels about prophecies and the end of the world.
    


            “Lori Vallow wanted to be Lori Daybell, wife of Chad Daybell, and in July 2019 Lori Vallow wanted to keep the same lifestyle that she had with Charles. And she could get all of this if Charles was dead,” Kay said. “She could marry Chad Daybell and become Lori Daybell. She would get a million-dollar life insurance policy.”
    


            Vallow Daybell's voice broke in her opening statement as she detailed the physical altercation with a baseball bat between her daughter Tylee Ryan and her fourth husband, Charles.
    


            Vallow Daybell said the evidence will show that Charles wrestled a baseball bat away from Tylee, and that Cox acted in self-defense as both she and Tylee rushed from the house.
    


            “Self-defense is not a crime. Family tragedy is not a crime, it's a tragedy,” Vallow Daybell said.
    


            Vallow was fatally shot in July 2019. Vallow Daybell then moved to Idaho with two of her youngest children and married Daybell two weeks after the death of his wife, Tammy Daybell. The bodies of the children — 7-year-old Joshua “JJ” Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee — were later found buried in rural Idaho on Chad Daybell's property.
    


            Vallow Daybell is already serving three life sentences in Idaho for the children's deaths and for conspiring to kill Tammy Daybell. Chad Daybell was sentenced to death in the three killings.
    


            Four months before he died, Charles Vallow filed for divorce from Vallow Daybell, saying she had become infatuated with near-death experiences and had claimed to have lived numerous lives on other planets.
    


            He alleged she threatened to ruin him financially and kill him. He sought a voluntary mental health evaluation of his wife.
    


            Police say Vallow was fatally shot by Cox at a home in a Phoenix suburb. Tylee, told police that she confronted Vallow with a baseball bat after she was awakened by yelling in the house.
    


            Tylee said she was trying to defend her mother, but Vallow took away the bat, according to police records. Cox told police that he fired after Vallow refused to drop the bat and came after him.

            Cox told investigators that Vallow Daybell and the children left the house shortly before the shooting.
    


            Cox, who claimed he acted in self-defense and wasn't arrested in Vallow's death, died five months later from what medical examiners said was a blood clot in his lungs. Cox's account was later called into question.
    


            Vallow Daybell was a beautician by trade, a mother of three and a wife — five times over.
    


            She married Vallow in 2006, and later adopted JJ, but by 2019 their marriage had soured. The two were estranged but still married when Cox fatally shot Vallow.
    


            Public interest from around the world only grew as the investigation into the missing children took several unexpected turns, each new revelation seemingly stranger than the last.
    


            Daybell, who was once a contestant on “Wheel of Fortune,” has been the subject of a Netflix documentary and Lifetime movie.
    


            If convicted in Arizona of conspiring to kill Vallow, she would face a life sentence.
    


            During the opening for the trial, Vallow Daybell wore civilian clothing. She won't be handcuffed or shackled when jurors are in the courtroom. However, she has to wear a belt-like device under her clothes that will let a jail officer deliver an electric shock by remote control if there's a disturbance.

            The Idaho investigation began at the end of 2019 when Vallow Daybell's adopted son's grandmother, worried about his welfare, reached out to police. Vallow Daybell had been evasive when asked about her two youngest children.
    


            Chad Daybell called 911 in October 2019 to report that his wife Tammy Daybell was battling an illness and died in her sleep. Her body was later exhumed, and an autopsy determined she died of asphyxiation.
    


            Idaho police did a welfare check on the kids in November 2019 and discovered they were missing and hadn't been seen since early September. Vallow Daybell and Chad Daybell left town a short time later, eventually turning up in Hawaii without the kids. She was arrested in Hawaii in February 2020 on a warrant out of Idaho.
    


            Defense attorneys told jurors that she was a “kind and loving mother” who happened to be interested in religion and biblical prophesies.
    


            A witness at the Idaho trial said Vallow Daybell believes evil spirits have taken over people in her life and turned them into “zombies.”
    


            Vallow Daybell is scheduled to go on trial again in late May on a charge of conspiring to murder Brandon Boudreaux. She has pleaded not guilty.
    


            If convicted, she would face an additional life sentence.

            As President Donald Trump's new tariffs shook global markets and sent foreign leaders scrambling this weekend, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent flew to Mar-a-Lago with a message.
    


            It was imperative to get the administration's tariff communications aligned, Bessent told Trump, and more focused on the endgame for Americans: better trade deals with foreign nations, according to people familiar with the conversation.
    


            The risk in not doing so would be further market turmoil, Bessent conveyed.
    


            The meeting was an example of the conflicting narratives swirling around Trump — with some corners pushing an effort to make deals and calm the markets. But five days after his splashy Rose Garden tariff announcement, foreign leaders and US investors alike are all still looking for clues of how willing the president is to negotiate down the duties. And as those outside observers pore over interviews and remarks from Trump's constellation of economic advisers, it has not been clear what it will take to end the global trade war.
    


            Delegations from US trading partners large and small were preparing to seek out American officials or plan trips to Washington to try and ascertain exactly how to remove the new duties. Offers were already coming in from some of the world's largest trading blocs. The European Union, for example, offered to drop tariffs to zero on automobiles and industrial goods.

Fact check: Trump falsely says Europe doesn't buy anything from US, wildly exaggerates trade deficit with China



            In all, 70 countries had approached the US administration to discuss trade issues in the wake of the new tariffs, administration officials said late Monday.
    


            Whether any of that outreach works remained an open question, with significant ramifications both for the global economy and American consumers. Mixed signals from Trump and members of his economic team on Monday offered little clarity on how and when relief might appear.
    


            One fact that did seem clear was Trump's willingness to weather whatever political or financial fallout occurs in the near term as the new tariffs take effect later this week. Instead of endorsing an off-ramp, he said he was willing to further ratchet up tariffs on China if that country's retaliatory tariffs remain in place.
    


            Bessent has been one of the most visible proponents of Trump's tariffs, and has ensured there is little daylight between himself and the president on the plan to apply the new duties. At the same time, he has also voiced the view that countries can and should seek out the administration for new trade agreements — a position the president himself took Monday after his meeting with his Treasury secretary in Florida, which was first reported by Politico.
    


            After a morning telephone call between Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Bessent announced that Trump had tasked him and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer with opening new negotiations with Japan meant to “implement the President's vision for the new Golden Age of Global Trade.”
    


            Yet at the same time, both Trump and his aides suggested those talks are not expected to yield results immediately.
    


            Other advisers continued to insist the conversations over tariffs were not “negotiations” at all, but rather a more permanent way to realign global trade.
    


            In describing Trump's approach, advisers said he was hoping to milk the United States' trading partners for everything he can get, and that doing so will likely take time. Because every country is different, those negotiations will be tailored to Trump's direct conversations with them, those advisers said.
    


            “Everyone is desperate. If you have a desperate partner you can get a lot more, in the long run,” one White House official told CNN, adding that dozens of countries are coming to the table with options for how to best move forward and that Trump “will choose the best deal he can make to ensure we're getting fair rates and bringing down the deficits.”
    


            The official added that for now, the White House expects other countries to bring them their best offers — and only then will Trump be willing to deal.
    


            A second Trump administration official told CNN that one of the highest priorities for the president is to work out deals that will erase America's trade deficit with other countries.
    


            Still, some officials behind the scenes believe that Trump should work out some deals sooner rather than later to put wins on the board to show the American people his tariff plan is working, and to further restore confidence in their overall message encouraging Americans to be patient, people familiar with the talks said.
    


            “You need to instill hope in people who are watching their 401ks dwindle and the stock market crash. They need to do something to convince them to hold on a little longer and buy them the time they need to work this out,” a person close to Trump told CNN.
    


            Some of Trump's wealthy supporters, such as billionaire investor Bill Ackman, publicly denounced the president's actions on tariffs, but others remained silent Monday as the turmoil continued on Wall Street.
    


            In interviews, some advisers to billionaire donors urged patience to see how Trump's moves would play out, noting they could result in negotiations that would significantly lower the tariff rates imposed by other countries. Some indicated they were more focused on their own priorities in Washington and not inclined to risk those goals by public feuding with the administration.
    


            But in the span of Monday afternoon, the administration offered divergent positions from different corners of the president's team.
    


            Just as Bessent posted on social media about leading negotiations with Japan, trade adviser Peter Navarro published a new opinion article in the Financial Times, staking out a firm line against easing off the tariffs and declaring, once again, “This is not a negotiation.”
    


            Speaking at a Washington think tank, another of Trump's top economic advisers acknowledged there were a variety of viewpoints.
    


            “There are conflicting narratives because everyone's got an opinion,” said Stephen Miran, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, during a speech at the Hudson Institute. “That's fine. Disagreement is how you can avoid group think.”

How actual ‘fake news' caused a market whiplash



            Still, the “conflicting narratives” emanating from the White House have also generated confusion on Wall Street and in foreign capitals. An erroneous report on social media Monday morning suggesting Trump was open to a 90-day pause on the new tariffs sent markets sharply higher, only to drop again after the White House denied it as “fake news.”
    


            Later in the Oval Office, Trump affirmed he wasn't looking at a pause in the new tariffs. And he suggested deals to remove the new duties wouldn't happen quickly.
    


            “We're going to get fair deals and good deals with every country. And if we don't, we're going to have nothing to do with them,” Trump said. “They're not going to be allowed to participate in the United States.”
    


            He went on to deny any disconnect in the messages his team has been conveying, on either the permanence of the tariffs or whether he was open to negotiations in bringing them down.
    


            “They can both be true. There can be permanent tariffs and they can also be negotiations, because there are things that we need beyond tariffs,” he said alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — who left Washington without any guarantee from Trump that the 17% tariff he announced on Israel last week would be lifted.

Some relief is flowing through financial markets worldwide Tuesday as stocks recover a bit of their historic losses since President Donald Trump dramatically raised the stakes in his trade war last week

U.S. stocks dropped after a second day of stunning reversals. The S&P 500 fell 1.6% Tuesday after wiping out an early gain of 4.1%, which had it on track for its best day in years. That brought the index nearly 19% below its record set in February.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 320 points after giving up an earlier surge of 1,460, while the Nasdaq composite lost 2.1%. Uncertainty is still high about what President Donald Trump will do with his trade war. The latest set of tariffs, including a massive 104% levy on Chinese imports, are scheduled to kick in after midnight.

What to know: 



On Tuesday:

For the week:

For the year:

Energy commodities gave up early gains to finish lower. U.S. crude fell 1.8% to $59.58 a barrel. Natural gas dropped 5.2%.

Shares of most oil and gas companies closed with losses. Occidental Petroleum dropped 6.8%, ConocoPhillips fell 3.5% and Exxon slipped 2.2%.

He told reporters Tuesday that he's particularly worried about the effect of U.S. tariffs and the trade war it's unleashing on “the most vulnerable developing countries in which the impact will be more devastating.”

Is the United Nations secretary-general worried a trade war will lead to a global recession?

“I sincerely hope that we will have no recession because a recession will have dramatic consequences, especially for the poorest people in the world,” Guterres said.

The dominant group of U.S. stocks known as the “Magnificent Seven” racked up more losses Monday after a broad Wall Street rally gave way to another market rout.

Shares in Tesla and Apple fell the most, declining 4.9% and 5%, respectively.

Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet all closed between 0.7% and 2.6% lower.

The “Magnificent Seven” are so massive in size, their movements carry more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes than other stocks.

Since the major market sell-off last Wednesday, the “Magnificent Seven” have shed a combined market value of $2.12 trillion.

Beijing on Tuesday requested consultations with the United States over the 34% “reciprocal'' tariff Trump imposed on Chinese imports.

The request is the first step the World Trade Organization's dispute resolution process. If the issue is not resolved in 60 days, China can request that a WTO panel hear its case.

The Geneva-based organization was set up to enforce the rules of global trade.

It's unlikely the Chinese complaint will amount to much. The United States in 2019 blocked the appointment of judges to the WTO Appellate Body, its supreme court. So cases that get appealed end up in limbo with no one to decide them.

U.S. stocks dropped after a second day of stunning reversals. The S&P 500 fell 1.6% Tuesday after wiping out an early gain of 4.1%, which had it on track for its best day in years. That brought the index nearly 19% below its record set in February. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 320 points after giving up an earlier surge of 1,460, while the Nasdaq composite lost 2.1%. 

Uncertainty is still high about what President Donald Trump will do with his trade war. The latest set of tariffs, including a massive 104% levy on Chinese imports, are scheduled to kick in after midnight.

The price of bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, fell to around $76,600 as it gave up an earlier gain, similar to stocks.

Also, the Justice Department announced it is disbanding a team of prosecutors who targeted cryptocurrency crimes and is shifting its focus away from complex crypto-related cases involving banking and securities law, according to a memo reviewed by The Associated Press.

It is often unclear what the president's endgame is, which adds to the uncertainty surrounding his trade wars. He has given different reasons for his sweeping import taxes, and sometimes they contradict each other.

Trump has said that tariffs can raise money for the U.S. Treasury, protect U.S. industries, draw factories to the United States and serve as a negotiating tactic to get other countries to bend to his will, whether it means getting them to reduce their own tariffs or to crack down on the illegal flow of drugs and immigrants into the United States.

However, if tariffs mean Americans buy fewer imports or if companies relocate factories to the United States, then revenue from tariffs will fall, undercutting his plan to use them as a money-generating alternative to the income tax.

Increased tariffs on China received more negative than positive evaluations from Americans, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey of views on Trump's early foreign policy actions.

The survey was conducted before Trump's April 2 announcement of the 34% reciprocal tariff on Chinese goods but after he had levied tariffs totaling 20% on Chinese goods over Beijing's alleged failure to stem the flow of fentanyl precursors.

About half of U.S. adults said increased tariffs on China will be bad for the U.S. and a similar share think the tariffs will be bad for them personally, the poll found. 

While Democrats overwhelmingly said the tariffs would be bad for the U.S. as well as for them personally, more Republicans said they would be good for the U.S. But when it came to tariffs' impact to them personally, Republicans are more likely to say the impact will be bad, although about half express uncertainty or say the impact will be limited.

President Donald Trump's top trade negotiator came under fire Tuesday from senators unnerved by the president's sweeping global tariffs, a market meltdown and the heightened risk of recession from an upended global trading order.

“It seems like we've decided to begin a trade war on all fronts,″ said Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina. He said he wanted to know who in the Trump administration he should hold responsible — and “choke″ — if the tariffs fail and Americans suffer from higher prices and slower economic growth. 

“I wish you well,″ he told U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. ”But I am skeptical.''

Greer addressed the Senate Finance Committee a day after global markets swung wildly and some business leaders lambasted the president's aggressive bid to raise tariffs on almost every nation on earth.

Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told representatives of business associations on Tuesday that she will propose “a zero for zero” approach to tariffs when she meets with President Trump in Washington on April 17. 

Meloni added that EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen backed that approach, which includes the possibility of eliminating reciprocal duties on existing industrial products with the zero-for-zero formula, according to a source attending Tuesday's meeting with Italian business representatives. They spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a closed door meeting. 

The White House now says that Trump's tariffs are bargaining chips to reach better international trade deals – suggesting they aren't permanent fixtures to reshape the global economy.

“Bring us your best offers and he will listen,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said of other countries potentially negotiating tariffs rates with Trump.

She said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu coming to Washington to talk trade “should serve as a model.”

Leavitt said China was “making a mistake” by responding with its own steep tariffs.

She insisted that negotiating, rather than steadfastly sticking to high tariffs, wasn't an evolution amid stock market turmoil.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday that the U.K. needs to keep its options open regarding the U.S. tariffs.

“My instinct is that we shouldn't jump in with both feet to retaliate,” Starmer told members of a Parliament committee. “Obviously we have to keep our options on the table and do the preparatory work for retaliation if necessary.”

Starmer said the tariffs are not a “temporary passing phase” but part of a “changing world order” and he wants to mitigate the import taxes through negotiation.

The U.K. is seeking a deal with the White House that would ease a 10% tariff on U.S. imports of British goods and a 25% tariff on cars.

Stock markets throughout Europe notched broad gains amid hopes that the potential for negotiations still exists over economically damaging tariffs.

Germany's DAX closed 2.5% after shedding 4.1% on Monday. France's CAC 40 rose 2.5% after shedding 4.8% on Monday. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 2.7% after falling 4.4% on Monday.

European markets have been following the same volatile twists and turns as U.S. and Asian markets. They will likely remain volatile amid the uncertainty over how and where the U.S. imposes tariffs, how other nations retaliate and how much damage the global economy sustains.

Major U.S. banks will report their latest earnings Friday, but with a trade war stoking recession fears, investors and economists will likely focus more on their forecasts than first-quarter results.

President Donald Trump's latest round of tariffs don't necessarily directly impact banks, although the potential downstream effects — namely inflation and slower economic growth — could throw a wrench into their projections this year and beyond.

What's more, analysts at JPMorgan point out that weaker global markets would lead to a decline in investment banking and wealth management fees, offset somewhat by higher trading revenue.

JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are among the big banks reporting Friday. Their shares dropped sharply at the end of last week but have recovered some losses the past two days.

The dominant group of U.S. stocks known as the “Magnificent Seven” is bouncing back, helping power the broad rally on Wall Street.

Chipmaker Nvidia and Tesla are leading the pack in midday trading with a gain of 5.5% and 5.4%, respectively. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet are all up between 3% and 2.1%.

The solid rebound comes a day after the a mixed finish for the group.

The “Magnificent Seven” are so massive in size, their movements carry more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes than other stocks.

Shares of major health insurers got a boost Tuesday after the federal government announced a better-than-expected 2026 payment increase for Medicare Advantage plans.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said Monday after markets closed that final rates are expected to increase more than 5% in 2026.

The rate increase is expected to cost taxpayers an additional $25 billion next year, CMS said.

Medicare Advantage plans are privately-run versions of the government-funded Medicare program mostly for people who are 65 and older.

Shares of the two largest Medicare Advantage plan providers, UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Humana Inc., climbed about 7% and 10%, respectively, Tuesday morning. Elevance Health Inc. and Centene Corp. rose nearly 4% each.

The health sector was among the biggest gainers in a broader market turnaround Tuesday.

Nvidia surged 5.3%, Broadcom jumped 7.6% and Advanced Micro Devices rose 3.5%. The companies and broader technology sector jumped amid hopes for negotiations over tariffs.

Chipmakers and other technology companies have an outsized impact on the broader market because of their pricey valuations. Big moves for the sector's most valuable companies can swing the market on their own or accentuate an already sharp move.

Technology companies have seen their values skyrocket over hopes for artificial intelligence advancements. Higher costs for chips and other technologies pose a risk to that development and the earnings growth prospects for those companies.

Visits to the U.S. from overseas fell 11.6% in March compared to the same month last year, according to preliminary government data.

Tourism industry experts suspect foreign travelers have been angered by President Donald Trumps' tariffs and rhetoric, and alarmed by reports of tourists getting arrested at the border.

The CEO of research institute that studies the preferences of Chinese tourists says leisure trips to places like Disneyland, Hawaii and New York are decreasing dramatically. He calls the trend the “Trump Slump.”

The Travel and Tourism Office data released Tuesday didn't include arrivals from Canada or land crossings from Mexico. Industry analysts are expecting U.S. visits by Canadians to drop significantly.

It depends on how businesses both in the United States and overseas respond, but consumers could see overall prices rising within a month or two of tariffs being imposed. For some products, such as produce from Mexico, prices could rise much more quickly after the tariffs take effect.



Some U.S. retailers and other importers may eat part of the cost of the tariff, and overseas exporters may reduce their prices to offset the extra duties. But for many businesses, the tariffs Trump announced Wednesday — such as 20% on imports from Europe — will be too large to swallow on their own.



Companies may also use the tariffs as an excuse to raise prices. When Trump slapped duties on washing machines in 2018, studies later showed that retailers raised prices on both washers and dryers, even though there were no new duties on dryers.



A key question in the coming months is whether something similar will happen again. Economists worry that consumers, having just lived through the biggest inflationary spike in four decades, are more accustomed to rising prices than they were before the pandemic.



Yet there are also signs that Americans, put off by the rise in the cost of living, are less willing to accept price increases and will simply cut back on their purchases. That could discourage businesses from raising prices by much.

Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said Tuesday that Thailand intends to send a high-ranking delegation to Washington to negotiate with their U.S. counterparts over the new tariff policies. 

Thailand is facing a 36% tariff under the new U.S. rules.

The decision to have a delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira was made after Paetongtarn held a meeting with her ministers of finance, foreign affairs an commerce, along with the Thai Trade Representative.

The Bangkok Post newspaper cited Pichai saying Thailand's plans include revising its import duties and amending non-trade barriers. 

Paetongtarn said the government had anticipated the issue and earlier this year established a U.S. Trade Policy Working Group to study developments and formulate a comprehensive response strategy. She said her government plans to roll out immediate relief for affected sectors, particularly small businesses and workers, while simultaneously crafting a broader economic overhaul to diversify export markets and boost national competitiveness.

Treasury yields are rising again in a potential signal that investors are gaining more confidence in the U.S. economy's path ahead.

The gains could also signal that investors expect more inflation ahead. Treasurys, which are often viewed as less risky investments than stocks, have been volatile amid worries about tariffs and the economy.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.24%, up from 4.17% late Monday and from 4.01% on Friday. Banks use the yield on the 10-year Treasury as a guide to pricing home loans.

The 10-year Treasury is often considered a proxy for the direction of mortgage rates.

The yield on the 2-year Treasury rose to 3.83% from 3.76% late Monday and from 3.64% late Friday. It often follows traders' expectations for the Federal Reserve's moves with short-term rates.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday spoke on the phone with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen saying China and Europe should boost communications, expand opening-up markets to each other and jointly defend free and open trade and investment. 

Li defended China's retaliatory measures to Trump's tariffs as not only safeguarding China's interests but also fighting for global trading rules. He said China and the EU can help provide “more stability and predictability” for each other and for the world, according to China's official news agency Xinhua. 

In the call, von der Leyen “underscored the vital importance of stability and predictability for the global economy,” according to the official readout on the phone call. She also stressed the responsibility of Europe and China, as two of the world's largest markets, to support a strong reformed trading system, which should be “free, fair and founded on a level playing field.”

The bounce back for global markets on Tuesday perhaps shouldn't be a surprise. Stocks don't go in one direction forever, and some of the best days in the market's history have been clustered around some of its worst days.

The biggest gain for the S&P 500 since World War II was an 11.6% surge on Oct. 13, 2008, for example. That was during the depths of the Great Recession, when worries were high that the financial system was collapsing and the S&P 500 was in the midst of a nearly 57% plunge from its peak in late 2007 until its bottom in March 2009. A couple weeks later, the index had another one of its best days in history, soaring 10.8%.

That's one of the reasons many financial advisers suggest not trying to time the market and selling stocks and other investments meant for the long term when nervous, because of the risk of missing out on such huge up days.

Small business owners' optimism slipped in March, as they dealt with looming tariffs and other new policies implemented by the Trump administration.

Optimism fell 3.3 points in March to 97.4, according to a poll by The National Federation of Independent Business, which is a widely used gauge of the economic health of small businesses.

The index fell slightly below the 51-year average of 98, following four months above the average.

“The implementation of new policy priorities has heightened the level of uncertainty among small business owners over the past few months.” said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. “Small business owners have scaled back expectations on sales growth as they better understand how these rearrangements might impact them.”

After hitting a new high last week, gold prices have tumbled following Trump's “Liberation Day.” But futures bounced back some Tuesday morning.

The price of New York spot gold hit all-time record on April 2, per FactSet, closing at about $3,134 per Troy ounce — the standard for measuring precious metals — just before Trump unveiled his self-described “reciprocal” tariffs. Prices fell in the days following, closing at nearly $2,982 Monday.

A rebound could be ahead. Futures jumped up to over $3,032 Tuesday morning.

Interest in buying gold typically spikes in times of uncertainty, as anxious investors seek a “safe haven” for parking their money. Many of Trump's previously-imposed tariffs have helped fuel gold's gains in recent months, even amid stock market turmoil. But precious metals are also volatile assets, so the future is never promised.

Levi Strauss executives said on a conference call with investors late Monday said that any price increases it undertakes related to tariffs would be “surgical,” instead of broad-based.

Shares of Levi Strauss rose 9% in early trading after the jeans maker posted better first-quarter profit than Wall Street forecast and said it expected “minimal” impact from tariffs in the second quarter.

“Most of the product for spring, early summer is already in the U.S.,” said chief financial officer Harmit Singh.

Just how much President Donald Trump's widespread tariffs would affect pricing has been a major concern for investors and analysts because tariffs generally act as a tax that gets passed on to consumers.

Levi earned 38 cents-per-share in the first quarter, easily topping the 28 cents-per-share that analysts forecast.

Economists at Goldman Sachs have raised their assessment of the odds the U.S. will experience a recession — where the economy shrinks and unemployment rises — to 45%, from 35%. Other economists are raising similar alarms, with JPMorgan putting the odds of a recession at 60% and projecting inflation will reach 4.4% by the end of this year, up from 2.8% currently.

Here's a few things to know about recessions and how they work: 

Are there any signs a recession is imminent?

Not yet. But one development that has sparked widespread fear is a real-time economy tracker maintained by the Federal Reserve's Atlanta branch. As of Monday, it was indicating that the economy could shrink by 0.8% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from 2.4% in last year's final quarter.

What signals would suggest that a recession has begun?

The clearest signal would be a steady rise in job losses and a surge in unemployment. The government's weekly report on the number of people seeking unemployment benefits, which is released every Thursday, is being closely watched for signs of rising layoffs. So far, applications for aid remain quite low by historical standards.

What are Trump and his officials saying?

President Donald Trump doubled down on his global tariffs Thursday, likening the U.S. economy to a ‘very sick' patient who came out of an operation. “It's gonna be a booming country, very booming country. It's going to be amazing, actually,” Trump said to reporters aboard Air Force One on his way down to one of his Florida golf clubs.

On Sunday, Trump told reporters that “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” Yet Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on the same day said “there doesn't have to be a recession” and that the administration is focused on “building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity.”

Tesla stock market value has lost nearly $400 billion since the S&P 500 hit a peak on Feb. 19, a stunning 35% plunge. The index, by contrast, has fallen 17%.

Investors pushed Tesla stock to a record high after Donald Trump was elected on hopes Musk's close ties would help the company. Instead, car buyers angry at Musk's support for Trump and other right-wing politicians have boycotted his company.

A sharp decline Monday put Tesla's stock at $233.29 and below its price on March 19, a key date. That is when Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made a surprising endorsement, urging Fox TV viewers to buy the stock in violation of a federal law banning government officials from endorsing companies.

Shares recovered somewhat in premarket trading Tuesday.

Futures for the S&P 500 gained 1.7% before the bell, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 2.1%. Nasdaq futures climbed 1.5%.

Among the early gainers in premarket trading are Humana, up 14%, CVS, up 9.5%, and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, up 6.8%.

If you're just getting read in for the day, here's a look at what happened overnight:

China still has a range of options to strike back at the Washington, experts say, including suspending cooperation on combating fentanyl, placing higher quotas on agricultural products and going after the U.S. trade in services in China such as finance and law firms.

U.S. total goods trade with China was an estimated $582 billion in 2024, making it the top trader in goods with the U.S. The 2024 deficit with China in goods and services trade was between $263 billion and $295 billion.

In Hong Kong, where stocks were slightly higher Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee said the city would link its economy closer to China's development, sign more free trade agreements, attract more foreign companies and capital to Hong Kong, and support local enterprises in coping with the impact of the tariffs.

World shares and U.S. futures advanced Tuesday, led by gains in Tokyo where the Nikkei 225 shot up just over 6% as markets calmed somewhat after the shocks from Trump's tariff hikes.

The modest rebound for most markets followed a wild day on Wall Street, where stocks careened after Trump threatened to crank his double-digit tariffs higher.

Germany's DAX gained 0.9% to 19,975.81 while the CAC 40 in Paris was up 1.3% at 7,018.79. Britain's FTSE 100 also picked up 1.3%, to 7,804.73.

Hong Kong also recovered some lost ground, but nothing close to the 13.2% dive Monday that gave the Hang Seng its worst day since 1997, during the Asian financial crisis.

The Hang Seng gained 1% to 20,036.03. The Shanghai Composite index jumped 1.4% to 3,140.15 after the government investment fund Central Huijin directed state-owned companies to help support the market with share purchases.

China said Tuesday it would “fight to the end” and take countermeasures against the United States to safeguard its own interests after Trump threatened an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports.

The Commerce Ministry said the U.S.‘s imposition of “so-called ‘reciprocal tariffs'” on China is “completely groundless and is a typical unilateral bullying practice.”

China, the world's second-largest economy, has announced retaliatory tariffs and the ministry hinted in its latest statement that more may be coming.

“The countermeasures China has taken are aimed at safeguarding its sovereignty, security and development interests, and maintaining the normal international trade order. They are completely legitimate,” the ministry said.

“The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the U.S. China will never accept this. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end,” it added.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Park Service has reversed edits and restored content to its webpage about Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad in the wake of news reports and public backlash over the changes. 

“Changes to the Underground Railroad page on the National Park Service's website were made without approval from NPS leadership nor Department leadership,” NPS spokeswoman Rachel Pawlitz said late Monday in an email. “The webpage was immediately restored to its original content.”

She did not say who ordered the changes or for what reason. The changes — first reported by The Washington Post — included removing Tubman's picture from the top of the page and making multiple edits to the text. A side-by-side analysis of the pages, using the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, revealed changes that removed references to slavery and changed descriptions about the issue and its brutal realities. 

For example, the original opening sentence referenced the railroad's core role in “the resistance to enslavement through escape and flight.” The edited version called the railroad “one of the most significant expressions of the American civil rights movement” and described how it “bridged the divides of race, religion, sectional differences, and nationality.”

The issue comes amid sweeping government changes to comply with President Donald Trump's campaign against so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies in the federal government. In some cases, officials have scrambled to remove and then restore online content as changes came to light. 




Trump has also targeted the Smithsonian network of museums, which includes the National Museum of African American History and Culture. He has tasked Vice President JD Vance with heading up the effort to purge what Trump termed “improper ideology” in the Smithsonian's depictions of American history.

Among the public controversies has been the Pentagon's wholesale deletions of pages related to the Navajo Code Talkers' contributions in World War II and baseball legend Jackie Robinson's military career. Both of those pages were quickly restored when the deletions drew public outcry. 

When the Harriet Tubman edits first came to light, NPS officials acknowledged the changes but denied any intention to downplay her role or soften the realities of America's history with slavery. 

“We celebrate her as a deeply spiritual woman who lived her ideals and dedicated her life to freedom,” Pawlitz said, citing dozens of pages about her, as well as two parks named for her. “The idea that a couple web edits somehow invalidate the National Park Service's commitment to telling complex and challenging historical narratives is completely false.” 

The revelation of the NPS edits drew an immediate backlash from civil rights figures. Bernice King, daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., posted on Instagram Monday that the changes constitute “an attack on truth, an attempt to erase history that would help us improve society today, a refusal to be uncomfortable.”

Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum discusses President Donald Trump's plan for a 'National Park of American Heroes' on 'The Story.'

FIRST ON FOX: The Department of Energy, the Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency are set to announce a bevy of new actions Tuesday afternoon that will "unleash" coal energy following President Donald Trump's expected signature on an executive order reinvigorating "America's beautiful clean coal industry," Fox News Digital learned. 

"The American people need more energy, and the Department of Energy is helping to meet this demand by unleashing supply of affordable, reliable, secure energy sources — including coal," Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a Tuesday statement provided to Fox News Digital. 

"Coal is essential for generating 24/7 electricity generation that powers American homes and businesses, but misguided policies from previous administrations have stifled this critical American industry," he said. "With President Trump's leadership, we are cutting the red tape and bringing back common sense."

Trump is expected to sign an executive order Tuesday afternoon that will cut through red tape surrounding the coal industry, including directing the National Energy Dominance Council to designate coal as a "mineral," end a current pause to coal leasing on federal lands, promote coal and coal technology exports, and encourage the use of coal to power artificial intelligence initiatives, Fox News Digital learned of the upcoming executive order.

The Departments of Energy and the Interior and the EPA will take actions supporting the Trump executive order Tuesday, including the Interior ending the current moratorium on federal coal leasing and removing regulatory burdens for coal mines, a press release first obtained by Fox Digital shows. 

COAL STILL KEY TO US ENERGY DOMINANCE, SAYS WEST VIRGINIA GOVERNOR

"The Golden Age is here, and we are starting to ‘Mine, Baby, Mine' for clean American coal," Department of the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. "Interior is unlocking America's full potential in energy dominance and economic development to make life more affordable for every American family while showing the world the power of America's natural resources and innovation."

The Interior Department explained that by expanding acces to coal reserves and cutting through red tape surrounding the permitting process, "the administration is removing long-standing regulatory barriers that have undermined American coal production."

"These efforts support high-paying mining jobs and rural economies, while strengthening U.S. energy independence by reducing reliance on foreign energy sources," the press release stated. "Coal is a critical component of a secure, stable and diversified American energy portfolio." 

MOUNTAIN STATE CRACKDOWN: WV GOV'S ORDER LEADS TO 60 SUSPECTED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMINAL DETENTIONS

At the Department of Energy, Wright is expected to announce five initiatives to strengthen coal innovation and mineral independence, Fox Digital learned. The five actions include: Reinstating of the National Coal Council; facilitating new investment in coal-powered electricity generation; the designation of steelmaking coal as a critical material and mineral; deploying mineral extraction technology from coal ash; and commercializing coal ash conversion technologies. 

The National Coal Council is a 50-member federal advisory committee that was established in 1984, but saw its charter expire under the Biden administration in 2021. The council acted as a guide for the government while navigating coal technologies and markets. Once reinstated, the council will include coal producers, users, equipment suppliers, state and local officials, and other stakeholders, according to a Department of Energy press release first obtained by Fox News Digital Tuesday.

The Energy Department's Loan Program Office's Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment (EIR) Program will also make $200 billion in financing available for coal energy investments, such as upgrading energy infrastructure and building new facilities that utilize legacy energy infrastructure.

The Department of Energy also will work with the Interior Department to recommend that coal, in the context of steelmaking, be designated as critical material and a critical mineral in the 2025 Critical Materials Assessment.

"This strategic designation will help ensure the U.S. maintains a stable supply of steelmaking coal in the decades to come and underscores the vital role of steelmaking coal in bolstering national security and economic stability," the Energy Department explained of the initiative.

The department is also expected to heighten its focus on coal ash, specifically employing its newly patented technology to extract critical minerals from coal ash, and commercializing the recovery of critical minerals from coal ash, which the Department of Energy said will reduce the U.S.' reliance on China for such materials.

"The Energy Department is committed to restoring American energy dominance and strengthening America's industrial base," the Department of Energy said of the initiative. "Secretary Wright will continue to work with all members of the National Energy Dominance Council to eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens on coal and unleash American energy." 

While the EPA is set to announce that $5.8 million in State and Tribal Assistance Grants funds will be made available to provide grants assisting states in the implementation of EPA-approved state Coal Combustion Residual program, which comes after Zeldin's EPA already has taken a handful of coal-related actions, such as reconsidering the Biden-era "Clean Power Plan 2.0." plan and revising coal regulations. 

"President Trump is delivering on the mandate Americans gave him last November by empowering different forms of domestic energy to drive down costs, increase domestic energy supply, and improve our grid security as we pioneer the path to become the Artificial Intelligence capital of the world," EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in comment provided to Fox News Digital. 

"The Obama and Biden administrations deliberately tried to regulate coal out of existence. Under my leadership, economic growth and environmental stewardship are not mutually exclusive choices. We are committed to supporting all forms of energy, including clean beautiful coal, and have already taken steps to bolster America's energy dominance and make energy affordable again while ensuring we have the cleanest air, land and water on the planet," Zeldin added. 

BIDEN ADMIN ISSUES ENERGY EFFICIENCY RESTRICTIONS ON KEY POWER GRID TECHNOLOGY

Producing energy at home in the U.S. was a cornerstone of Trump's campaign, with the then-candidate vowing that the U.S. would no longer rely on foreign nations for oil by reinvigorating the coal industry, and tapping oil in the U.S.

"We will develop the liquid gold that is right under our feet, including American oil and natural gas and we will also embrace nuclear, clean coal, hydropower, which is fantastic, and every other form of affordable energy to get it done," Trump said in 2023.

The Tuesday executive order is expected to build on Trump's pledge to make the U.S. energy independent while also providing cheaper energy costs to Americans, and follows previous actions such as withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, terminating the liberal climate plan dubbed the Green New Deal in a January executive order, and reversing a pause on liquefied natural exports, a fact sheet on the upcoming executive order argued.

Live Updates


            • Looming tariffs: President Donald Trump will impose at least a 104% tariff on Chinese imports tomorrow after Beijing missed the White House's deadline to stand down on its retaliatory threat, the administration said, as the US moves to enact massive so-called reciprocal tariffs on several countries amid mounting fears of a global recession. China said today it would “fight to the end” of the trade war and continue to stand up to Trump.
    


• Legal win: The Supreme Court said today that it will allow several thousand probationary federal employees off the payroll while lower courts weigh whether downsizing efforts are legal.
    


            • Data-sharing deal: The Internal Revenue Service and Department of Homeland Security finalized an agreement to provide sensitive taxpayer data to federal immigration authorities — including information about certain undocumented immigrants, according to court filings.
    


            The White House said President Donald Trump does imagine products like iPhones could be manufactured in the United States
    


            The remarks come after Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on CBS “Face the Nation” on Sunday that “the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little- little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America.” He went on to say that he imagines that process would be automated.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump “absolutely” thinks technology like iPhones could move production to the US.
    


                    “He believes we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it,” she said, pointing to Apple's planned investments. Apple said in February that it would put $500 billion into expanding US facilities over the next four years, a move that could help it avoid new tariffs on goods imported from China.
                





            She also said the president is “also looking at advanced technologies,” such as artificial intelligence and other “emerging fields.”
    


            “So there's an array of diverse jobs, more traditional manufacturing jobs, as you discussed, but also jobs in advanced technologies. The president is looking at all of those, he wants them to come back home,” Leavitt said.
    


            The American Civil Liberties Union filed an emergency lawsuit in federal court today seeking to halt removals under the Alien Enemies Act for people who may be targeted for deportation in New York.
    


            The lawsuit comes hours after the Supreme Court lifted a temporary restraining order challenging President Donald Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which gives the administration tremendous authority to target and speed up deportations of alleged gang members.
    


            The ACLU filed the lawsuit and temporary restriction order with the court challenging the use of the act to remove Venezuelan nationals, saying its use is unlawful, exceeds statutory authority, denies people of the right to due process, and violates immigration laws and protections for asylum seekers.
    


            Plaintiffs are also asking the court to certify a class action representing all noncitizens in immigration custody who are or will be subject to the presidential proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act.
    


            The legal action is being filed in partnership with the New York Civil Liberties Union and The Legal Aid Society which is representing two clients they say are at risk of deportation under Trump's policy.
    


            Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the White House will let the “public sparring continue” between Elon Musk and the president's top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, over the wisdom of Donald Trump's new tariffs.
    


                    “These are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and on tariffs. Boys will be boys, and we will let their public sparring continue,” Leavitt said in response to a question about the back-and-forth from CNN's Alayna Treene today.
                





            The press secretary said it is one example of Trump's “willingness to hear from all sides” and that the president has people with “diverse opinions on very diverse issues” in his inner circle.
    


Some background: Navarro dismissed the Tesla founder and top Trump adviser as a “car assembler” in an interview on CNBC after Musk criticized the new tariffs. The trade adviser has insisted Trump's levies are not a tax increase but a tax cut.
    


            Musk replied to a post on X of the interview, saying that Navarro is “truly a moron.” Later, defending his car company's made-in-America credentials, Musk wrote that “Tesla has the most American-made cars. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks.”
    


            Musk said over the weekend that he wants to see a “zero-tariff situation” between the US and European Union, breaking with Trump. He has advocated against the new tariffs, including in public remarks and private conversations with the president, according to people familiar with the matter.

            President Donald Trump is set to impose an additional 84% in levies across all Chinese imports tomorrow, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced on Tuesday.
    


             That will mean all goods from the country are subject to a tariff of at least 104%.
    


            China was already set to see tariffs increase by 34% on Wednesday as part of Trump's “reciprocal” tariffs package. But the president tacked on another 50% after Beijing didn't back off its promise to impose 34% retaliatory tariffs on US goods by noon Tuesday.
    


                    “Countries like China, who have chosen to retaliate and try to double down on their mistreatment of American workers, are making a mistake,” Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday. “President Trump has a spine of steel, and he will not break.”
                





            “The Chinese want to make a deal, they just don't know how to do it,” she added. She declined to share what, if any, terms Trump would consider to lower tariffs on China.
    


More context: China was America's second largest source of imports last year, shipping a total of $439 billion worth of goods to the US while the US exported $144 billion worth of goods to China. The mutual tariffs threaten to hurt domestic industries and are poised to result in layoffs.

            The White House insisted today that discussions being held this weekend with Iran will be “direct” despite pushback from Iranian officials that the talks will be indirect.
    


                    “When it comes to Saturday, I won't get ahead of the president,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during her briefing with reporters. “He has said there will be direct talks with Iran on Saturday, I won't further any details from this podium for obvious reasons, security reasons. We'll provide an update as we always have,” she said when asked about the nature of the talks.  
                





            Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that talks with Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will be indirect, Iran's semi-official media outlet Tasnim News reported earlier Tuesday. Oman would mediate the talks, according to Tasnim.
    


            State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Trump's foreign envoy Steve Witkoff would be there. Earlier, a person familiar with the meeting told CNN that Witkoff would lead the US side in the talks.
    


            Bruce insisted it is a “meeting,” rather than a negotiation and would not give specifics on the planned discussions.
    


            “We do know that there is something very, very clear and distinct that is on the table that needs to be accomplished,” she said. “The very specific thing that needs to be accomplished, which would make the world a much safer place, is to make sure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon.”
    


This post has been updated with more about Witkoff and from the State Department.



            President Donald Trump has instructed his trade team to make “tailor-made” trade deals with countries that want to negotiate following the president's global tariff policy announcement last week, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
    


                    “The entire administration has always said that President Trump is willing to pick up the phone and talk. And the president met with his trade team this morning, and he directed them to have tailor-made trade deals with each and every country that calls up this administration to strike a deal,” Leavitt told reporters at the White House press briefing.
                





            Pressed further on whether the president has any timeline or deadline he wants trade deals to be made by, Leavitt again reiterated that they won't be “off-the-rack deals.”
    


            The president's top trade negotiator defended the expansive US tariffs in a Senate hearing today, saying almost 50 countries have approached him to “explore how to achieve reciprocity.”
    


            El Salvador President Nayib Bukele will visit the White House on Monday, where he and President Donald Trump will discuss the use of the country's “super max prison for Tren De Aragua and MS-13 gang members,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during today's briefing.
    


            The two leaders will speak about the partnership between the two countries for Trump's immigration policy and how “El Salvador's cooperation with the United States has become a model for others to work with this administration,” Leavitt added.
    


            The country's CECOT mega-prison is considered the largest prison in the Americas, with a capacity of 40,000 inmates. Under a deal between the US and El Salvador, the prison is housing immigrants deported by the US who it says are alleged gang members.
    


            Leavitt also confirmed that Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will visit the White House next Thursday.
    


            Former Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell voted against confirming Elbridge Colby to be undersecretary of defense for policy, marking yet another nominee of President Donald Trump whom the senior Republican has balked at supporting.
    


            Colby — who served in the Pentagon in the first Trump administration — was confirmed 54-45, with several Democrats voting for his confirmation: Sens. Mark Kelly, Elissa Slotkin and Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee.
    


            In a statement on his vote, McConnell criticized Colby's isolationist views and warned that his confirmation could lead to “irreparable damage” to US alliances.
    


            “Mr. Colby's confirmation leaves open the door for the less-polished standard-bearers of restraint and retrenchment at the Pentagon to do irreparable damage to the system of alliances and partnerships which serve as force multipliers to U.S. leadership,” the Kentucky Republican said. “It encourages isolationist perversions of peace through strength to continue apace at the highest levels of Administration policymaking.”
    


                    He added: “Make no mistake: America will not be made great again by those who are content to manage our decline.”
                





            After relinquishing his leadership post, McConnell has increasingly bucked Trump and the evolving GOP. He opposed Pete Hegseth for defense secretary; Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence; and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. All were confirmed to their posts.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson today applauded the decision by the US Supreme Court to allow President Donald Trump to enforce the Alien Enemies Act for now to carry out his administration's rapid deportations efforts.
    


                    “We do applaud the ruling from the Supreme Court. I think the most important principle that came out of that is that they said you can't go venue shopping for this. They're going to return that back to the court in Texas where it belongs. And I think that's a very important step,” he told reporters during a news conference.
                





            Asked whether Congress should allocate additional funding to the judicial branch to address immigration case backlogs and ensure deportees get due process, Johnson acknowledged that more resources are required “because we have so many people to process” and that “we have to give Customs and Border Patrol agents and everybody involved in the process the resources they need to get the job done.”
    


            Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will meet President Donald Trump next Thursday as world leaders clamor for talks to secure relief from new tariffs, according to a person familiar with the matter.
    


            The meeting will be closely watched for how willing Trump is to strike a deal not only with Italy but the larger European Union to ease the new duties.
    


            Meloni, a fellow right-wing politician, has close ties to Trump and attended his inauguration.
    


            She has presented herself as a potential bridge between Europe and the Trump White House amid ongoing tensions over defense spending and trade.

            The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed the Trump administration to keep several thousand probationary federal employees it is attempting to fire off the payroll while lower courts weigh whether the downsizing efforts are legal, another win for the White House in recent days.
    


            The Supreme Court's decision blocks a ruling from a lower court judge that required the government to reinstate more than 16,000 probationary employees.
    


Keep in mind: The decision is not the final word on whether the employees will be allowed to keep their jobs, but it will have a significant impact on both the workers and the agencies in the meantime.
    


            Two liberal justices – Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson – publicly dissented.
    


            The full implications of the ruling are not clear given that a federal judge in Maryland earlier this month issued a preliminary injunction that reinstated some of the employees not covered in the case before the Supreme Court.
    


            Key GOP senators acknowledged the short-term economic disruption of tariffs and expressed hope that negotiations will eventually roll back President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariff policy.
    


Here's what they are saying: 



This reported has been updated with additional comments from GOP senators. 



            President Donald Trump will sign an executive order to “reinvigorate” coal, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
    


            Trump is scheduled to participate in an executive order signing event today to “unleash American energy” at 3 p.m. ET, according to the White House. Leavitt also confirmed in a social media post that the president's executive order will seek to tap into coal.
    


            “Coal is critical to achieving American Energy and AI Dominance,” she said.
    


            Trump has consistently voiced his intention to leverage US coal, along with oil, natural gas and nuclear power. The president has also expressed a broader effort to undo the energy policies implemented by former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.
    


            A senior House Democrat is planning to force a vote to terminate President Donald Trump's steep global tariffs that have rattled American consumers and could soon raise the prices of everything from groceries to gasoline, according to a person familiar with the plans.
    


            A day before Trump's tariffs are set to take effect, New York Rep. Gregory Meeks will soon introduce a measure that would use Congress' power to overrule the White House on trade policy.
    


            His resolution — which is expected to be deemed “privileged,” which means it will come to the floor despite GOP leadership opposition — would end the tariffs announced by the White House on April 2.
    


            If it is indeed privileged, as both parties expect, the vote must come up within 15 days.
    


            It is unlikely to succeed, given the White House has already warned it would override any potential measure. But Democrats want to force House Republicans to decide whether they'll back the president or attempt to prevent price hikes.
    


            US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee that the Trump administration's trade concerns will likely not be fixed anytime soon, but stood by President Donald Trump's tariff actions as a step in the right direction.
    


                    “Our large and persistent trade deficit has been over 30 years in the making, and it will not be resolved overnight,” Greer told the committee during a routine hearing. “But all of this is in the right direction, particularly as we start to negotiate with these countries.”
                





Here's what to know:



Remember: Trump's sweeping tariffs have targeted all US trading partners, and the International Chamber of Commerce has said that'll raise the risk of global trade tensions spiraling out of control. If that happens, that could send inflation skyrocketing and weaken economic growth.
    


This post has been updated with more of Greer's testimony. 



            A Russian foreign ministry delegation will hold planned talks with the United States on Thursday in Istanbul, Turkey, according to the Kremlin.
    


            The Russian delegation will be led by Russian Ambassador to the US Alexander Darchiev and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Russia and Central Europe, Sonata Coulter, state media TASS reported on Tuesday, citing the foreign ministry.
    


            The talks “will be devoted to normalizing the work of the embassies,” TASS said.
    


            Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier that the meeting follows the round of discussions between Moscow and Washington in Istanbul on February 27, which focused on working to ease tensions and restore bilateral contacts.
    


            The US State Department called the previous talks in Istanbul “constructive discussions.”
    


            The Kremlin spokesperson said at a press briefing today that Russia would continue conducting the negotiations through its foreign ministry, adding that further updates would be provided by the ministry.
    


            The European Union is prepared to negotiate with the United States over buying more of its liquefied natural gas, according to the bloc's executive arm.
    


            On Monday, US President Donald Trump said the EU must buy around $350 billion worth of American LNG to compensate for the deficit the US has in goods trade with the bloc.
    


            Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, a spokesperson for the European Commission, told reporters Tuesday: “Half of our LNG already comes from the United States, and we are ready, going forward, to work with Trump administration. We are ready to discuss. We're ready to negotiate.”
    


            Itkonen also said the EU intends to keep its “energy sources diverse” to avoid becoming too dependent on any one supplier.
    


            The bloc had “learned (its) lesson,” she said, from its experience having to rapidly replace its imports of Russian piped natural gas and oil following Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The EU has ramped up its imports of American LNG to help plug that gap.
    


            America was the bloc's biggest supplier of LNG in 2024, representing a 45% share of those imports, according to the commission.
    


            Trump said yesterday that America's goods deficit with the EU could “disappear easily and quickly” if the bloc bought more American energy.
    


More context: Trump has repeatedly said that the US runs a $350 billion deficit in goods trade with the EU. Although there is a large discrepancy between the deficit figures cited by the EU and US because of the different ways they are calculated, neither figure is anywhere near as large as what Trump has claimed.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today that moves to negotiate on tariffs have “nothing to do with the market,” but are the “result of the massive inflow” of calls to President Donald Trump.
    


                    “Negotiations are the result of the massive inflow of inbound calls to come and negotiate; it had nothing to do with the market,” Bessent told CNBC, noting that 70 countries have reached out to open tariff talks with the US.
                





            US stocks mostly fell after an extremely volatile day yesterday — tumbling, surging and then bouncing around in every direction, as traders searched for any sign that Trump's tariffs could be negotiated or halted.
    


            “We were having a discussion last night about which countries to prioritize, and I think you are going to see some very large countries with large trade deficits come forward very quickly,” Bessent said. “If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals,” he added, noting the president will be personally involved in negotiations.
    


            As CNN reported yesterday, Bessent flew to Mar-a-Lago over the weekend with a message to the president on tariffs: zero in on the endgame.
    


            “I went down to see President Trump, as I do many weekends, and I can tell you, it's all President Trump's decision. And he had a view on after Liberation Day, that we should go into quiet mode and let our partners think about the kind of the shock and awe that he presented,” Bessent said when asked about his message to the president.
    


CNN's David Goldman, John Towfighi and Matt Egan contributed reporting to this post. 



            Republican senators who are supporting the bipartisan effort to rein in President Donald Trump's tariff powers said today that they think Congress should be able to hold the administration accountable.
    


            Sen. Thom Tillis told CNN he's mostly hearing from businesses in his state and concerns about the “cost of inputs.” On constituent reaction, he said it's “only beginning to trickle in now. If you think about when the tariffs were implemented, you won't see these costs for another week or two as things come onshore.”
    


            Pressed on the impact on farmers, Tillis called it a “stability issue” for businesses, adding, “We've got a lot of uncertainty.”
    


            He said he plans to ask US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday about “who's on point” on trade policy.
    


                    “In business, you always come up with decisions. You create one throat to choke. I'm just trying to figure out who I should compliment or who I should hold accountable,” he said.
                





            Tillis, who is up for reelection next year, is a cosponsor of a bipartisan bill meant to reassert congressional authority and rein in the president's ability to unilaterally level tariffs. Trump has already said he'll veto it, and Senate Majority Leader Thune has signaled he's not eager to bring it to the floor.
    


            Sen. Todd Young, who has also signed onto the bill, told CNN that Congress should “play a meaningful role when it comes to developing revenue measures, whether it's taxes or tariffs.”
    


            Young said Trump needs “broad discretion” to enforce “whatever Congress develops and implements,” adding that he's been working with the administration on enforcing existing tariff laws. He said the White House has “engaged in a dialogue” on tariffs and has been “helpful and responsive,” and “we're waiting now for more information on their next steps.”
    


            White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said the administration is managing “a massive number of requests for negotiations” from nations to avoid having “reciprocal” tariffs levied on them starting at 12:01 a.m. ET. Wednesday.
    


            Hassett added that Trump “prioritizes two of our closest allies and trading partners: Japan and Korea,” he said in a Tuesday morning Fox News interview. “The word out of those conversations was really positive.”
    


            Earlier on Tuesday, Trump posted on Truth Social that he had “a great call with the Acting President of South Korea.” On Monday, Trump also spoke with Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who will be sending a team to visit Washington to negotiate a trade deal.
    


            Japan was the top-fifth source of foreign goods shipped to the United States last year, while South Korea was the seventh, according to federal trade data.
    


            A dispute appears to have escalated between two of President Donald Trump's top advisers over the wisdom of the new tariffs the president has applied to dozens of countries.
    


            Elon Musk, the billionaire who has become Trump's most powerful adviser, has criticized the tariffs and lashed out against trade adviser Peter Navarro, after Navarro dismissed the Tesla founder as a “car assembler.”
    


                    “Navarro is truly a moron,” Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.
                





            Later, defending Tesla's Made-in-America credentials, Musk wrote that “Tesla has the most American-made cars.”
    


                    “Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks,” Musk wrote.
                





            Musk has advocated against the new tariffs, including in public remarks and private conversations with Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.
    


            Judge James Boasberg has canceled today's scheduled hearing on the request for a preliminary injunction against Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations following last night's Supreme Court ruling.
    


Remember: The Supreme Court yesterday allowed President Donald Trump to enforce the Alien Enemies Act for now, handing the White House a significant victory that will let immigration officials rely on a sweeping wartime authority to rapidly deport alleged gang members.
    


            The unsigned decision in the case, one of the most closely watched emergency appeals pending at the Supreme Court, lets Trump invoke the 1798 law to speed removals while litigation over the act's use plays out in lower courts. The court stressed that going forward, people who are deported should receive notice they are subject to the act and an opportunity to have their removal reviewed by the federal court where they are being detained.
    


            The court's three liberal justices dissented from the decision, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a member of the court's conservative wing, partially dissented.
    


CNN's John Fritze and Devan Cole contributed reporting. 



            Attorney General Pamela Bondi called Monday's Supreme Court decision allowing the administration to rapidly deport alleged gang members a “landmark victory for the rule of law.”
    


                    “This is a landmark victory for the rule of law, and this is what we've been arguing on behalf of President Trump,” she told Fox News from the White House on Tuesday.
                





More on the ruling: The court allowed President Donald Trump to enforce the Alien Enemies Act while litigation over the act's use plays out in lower courts. The court stressed that going forward, people who are deported should receive notice they are subject to the act and an opportunity to have their removal reviewed by the federal court where they are being detained.
    


            “It's a habeas hearing in the court of confinement, which means in Texas, so it will be a much faster hearing. They can't do class actions. It will be a much smoother, simpler hearing and these people will be deported,” Bondi said.
    


            When pressed by CNN's Alayna Treene as to why the Justice Department believes a mistakenly deported Maryland man with protected legal status should remain in a mega prison in El Salvador, Bondi doubled down on the administration's original response to the error.
    


            “It was an administrative error as to why he was deported, and he is a known gang member,” the attorney general said. “ICE testified he was a gang member, and we believe he should stay where he is.”
    


            The government initially alleged Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia was part of the MS-13 gang, but there is not a court case linking him to the group.
    


            President Donald Trump said he had a “great call” with South Korea's acting president this morning, noting that they have the “confines” of a deal for both countries and that a negotiating team is on its way to the US.
    


            “Their top TEAM is on a plane heading to the U.S., and things are looking good,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
    


                    “We are likewise dealing with many other countries, all of whom want to make a deal with the United States. Like with South Korea, we are bringing up other subjects that are not covered by Trade and Tariffs, and getting them negotiated also. ‘ONE STOP SHOPPING' is a beautiful and efficient process!!!”
                





            Trump, however, specifically called out China — on which he's threatened additional tariffs — saying, “China also wants to make a deal, badly, but they don't know how to get it started. We are waiting for their call. It will happen!”
    


            Trump said he spoke with South Korea about tariffs and military protection.
    


            He went on to project optimism about a deal. “In any event, we have the confines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries,” he wrote.
    


            President Donald Trump is expected to meet with a group of House Republicans who have expressed opposition in voting for the GOP budget resolution, two sources tell CNN.
    


            The meeting is expected to be at 1 p.m. ET.
    


            CNN reported Monday that House Speaker Mike Johnson, facing significant work ahead of him to garner enough support for the Senate's budget blueprint, is meeting with holdouts and stressing the need for urgency at this stage of the process. He threatened weekend work if the House can't get the budget passed by Thursday.
    


CNN's Lauren Fox contributing reporting to this post.



            After markets plunged over the course of the past three trading sessions, Wall Street investors were looking for any excuse to catch their breath ahead of another planned tariff escalation at midnight.
    


            They seem to have found one — at least for now.
    


            US stocks opened higher Tuesday, setting the stage for a rebound. The Dow rose 1,360 points, or 3.6%. The broader S&P 500 gained 3.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 3.76%.
    


            However, there's no guarantee stocks will remain buoyant.
    


            After imposing across-the-board 10% tariffs on virtually all products coming into the United States Saturday, the Trump administration is set to impose significantly steeper levies still on dozens of countries. Those tariffs, which Trump has called “reciprocal,” although they are no such thing, amount to as much as 50% for a handful of countries — and some tariffs on China could rise to about 70%.
    


            Trump also threatened to slap an extra 50% tariff on China if the country doesn't back down from its retaliatory tariffs it announced Friday. China's Commerce Ministry on Tuesday said the country would “fight to the end” of the trade war and would continue to stand up to Trump.
    


            President Donald Trump's US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is expected to defend the administration's tariffs in remarks before the Senate Finance Committee at a hearing this morning.
    


                    “Last Wednesday, President Trump declared a national emergency in response to the large and persistent trade deficit that has built up in recent years,” Greer said, according to a copy of his prepared remarks obtained by CNN. “This deficit is driven in part by non-reciprocal tariffs, trading barriers, and other economic policies pursued by our foreign trading partners. President Trump imposed tariffs to address this emergency.”
                





            Greer is expected to further say that the president's “strategy is already bearing fruit” and that nearly “50 countries have approached me to discuss the President's new policy and explore how to achieve reciprocity.”
    


            Greer's hearing is scheduled to start at 10 a.m. ET.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expects businesses will take a wait-and-see attitude to find out how trade negotiations between the United States and its trading partners play out before they make any decision on building new plants in America. But he said they are preparing to make such a move.
    


            “Business leaders have substantial lead time,” Bessent said in an interview on CNBC this morning. “I'm sure that they are putting together plans for what they would like to do when we finish these negotiations.”
    


            President Donald Trump has promised his tariff plan will create a manufacturing boom in the United States. But Bessent acknowledged that won't happen overnight.
    


                    “They're not going to snap their fingers, find a green field site and build a factory,” he added. “But I am sure that the planning has already started in board rooms. I spent the weekend talking to CEOs and investment bankers and that's exactly what's happening.”
                





            The Internal Revenue Service and Department of Homeland Security finalized an agreement Monday to provide sensitive taxpayer data to federal immigration authorities, according to court filings.
    


            As part of the deal, the IRS agreed to turn over information about undocumented immigrants that DHS says are already facing deportation orders and are under federal criminal investigation, according to the filings.
    


            The agreement was signed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
    


            President Donald Trump's foreign envoy Steve Witkoff will lead the US side in talks over a new nuclear deal with Iran, a person familiar with this weekend's meeting in Oman confirmed to CNN.
    


            The administration believes, as Trump said yesterday, that these will be direct talks between the two sides, the source said.
    


            But Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said talks with Witkoff will be indirect, Iran's semi-official media outlet Tasnim News reported earlier today.
    


            Oman will mediate the talks, according to Tasnim, despite Trump saying yesterday that direct talks between the US and Iran had already begun.
    


            The two parties will discuss Iranian denuclearization, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.
    


            “It is as much an opportunity as it is a test. The ball is in America's court,” Araghchi said on X yesterday.
    


Some background: Tehran and Washington have not engaged in direct formal talks since the Obama administration negotiated the Iran nuclear deal in 2015, when Iran gave up most of its nuclear capability in return for better integration into the global economy.
    


            Iran restarted its nuclear programs after Trump quashed that deal in 2018.
    


Israeli reaction: The talks are “certainly not” to Israel's liking, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            Trump announced them while seated next to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office yesterday. The sudden revelation appeared to surprise Netanyahu, with a smile quickly vanishing from his face as he looked toward his team of advisers. It's unclear if Netanyahu was given an advance notice or if he was consulted ahead of time, the sources said.

            President Donald Trump doesn't look like he's going to blink.
    


            Chaos and fear unleashed by his “Liberation Day” trade war has only made him more adamant about his lifelong conviction that the world's greatest economy is a victim of cheating rivals bent on ripping it off.
    


            Trump did say Monday he's open to trade talks with powers like Japan and Israel. The prospect of nascent negotiations meant there was no repeat of gargantuan losses of last week on US markets.
    


            But he also threatened to raise cumulative tariffs on China to over 100% — a move that could lead to massive price increases for US shoppers for iPhones, computers and toys. He also implied that the America's erstwhile friends in the European Union were such implacable foes that there can never be a fair deal.

            China's Commerce Ministry says it “firmly opposes” the additional 50% tariffs on Chinese imports threatened by President Donald Trump on Monday, calling it “a mistake upon a mistake.”
    


            “If the United States implements the escalating tariff measures, China will resolutely take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests,” the ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.
    


            It denounced Trump's “reciprocal tariffs” as “completely unfounded” and “typical unilateral bullying.”
    


                    “The US threat to escalate tariffs is a mistake on top of a mistake, which once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the US. China will never accept this. If the US insists on its own way, China will fight to the end,” the ministry said.
                





            Reiterating that there are no winners in a trade war, the ministry emphasized that “pressure and threats are not the right way to engage with China.”
    


            “We urge the US to immediately correct its erroneous practices, cancel all unilateral tariff measures against China, stop suppressing China in the economic and trade sphere, and resolve differences properly through equal dialogue based on mutual respect,” the statement added.
    


            Stock markets around the world rose Tuesday after a major rout the previous day, fueled by fears over the economic fallout of US President Donald Trump's new tariffs.
    


            Most Asian stock indexes closed higher:
    


            Across Europe:
    


            US stock futures were also higher. The Dow index was on track to open 1.8% up and the S&P 500 index 1.6% higher. For the tech-heavy Nasdaq index, futures pointed to a 1.6% rise at the open.
    


            The big headline from Monday evening was a significant White House victory.
    


            The Supreme Court allowed Donald Trump to enforce the Alien Enemies Act for now, which will let immigration officials rely on a sweeping wartime authority to rapidly deport alleged gang members.
    


            Trump wrote on Truth Social yesterday that it was “a great day for justice in America.”

Watch live from the New York Stock Exchange.

Stocks gave up an early rally and briefly went negative as big swings rocked Wall Street for a second straight day. The S&P 500 erased nearly all of a 4% gain by early afternoon and was up just 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 254 points, and the Nasdaq composite was near breakeven.

What to know: 



President Donald Trump's top trade negotiator came under fire Tuesday from senators unnerved by the president's sweeping global tariffs, a market meltdown and the heightened risk of recession from an upended global trading order.

“It seems like we've decided to begin a trade war on all fronts,″ said Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina. He said he wanted to know who in the Trump administration he should hold responsible — and “choke″ — if the tariffs fail and Americans suffer from higher prices and slower economic growth. 

“I wish you well,″ he told U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. ”But I am skeptical.''

Greer addressed the Senate Finance Committee a day after global markets swung wildly and some business leaders lambasted the president's aggressive bid to raise tariffs on almost every nation on earth.

Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told representatives of business associations on Tuesday that she will propose “a zero for zero” approach to tariffs when she meets with President Trump in Washington on April 17. 

Meloni added that EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen backed that approach, which includes the possibility of eliminating reciprocal duties on existing industrial products with the zero-for-zero formula, according to a source attending Tuesday's meeting with Italian business representatives. They spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a closed door meeting. 











The White House now says that Trump's tariffs are bargaining chips to reach better international trade deals – suggesting they aren't permanent fixtures to reshape the global economy.

“Bring us your best offers and he will listen,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said of other countries potentially negotiating tariffs rates with Trump.

She said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu coming to Washington to talk trade “should serve as a model.”

Leavitt said China was “making a mistake” by responding with its own steep tariffs.

She insisted that negotiating, rather than steadfastly sticking to high tariffs, wasn't an evolution amid stock market turmoil.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday that the U.K. needs to keep its options open regarding the U.S. tariffs.

“My instinct is that we shouldn't jump in with both feet to retaliate,” Starmer told members of a Parliament committee. “Obviously we have to keep our options on the table and do the preparatory work for retaliation if necessary.”

Starmer said the tariffs are not a “temporary passing phase” but part of a “changing world order” and he wants to mitigate the import taxes through negotiation.

The U.K. is seeking a deal with the White House that would ease a 10% tariff on U.S. imports of British goods and a 25% tariff on cars.

Stock markets throughout Europe notched broad gains amid hopes that the potential for negotiations still exists over economically damaging tariffs.

Germany's DAX closed 2.5% after shedding 4.1% on Monday. France's CAC 40 rose 2.5% after shedding 4.8% on Monday. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 2.7% after falling 4.4% on Monday.

European markets have been following the same volatile twists and turns as U.S. and Asian markets. They will likely remain volatile amid the uncertainty over how and where the U.S. imposes tariffs, how other nations retaliate and how much damage the global economy sustains.

Major U.S. banks will report their latest earnings Friday, but with a trade war stoking recession fears, investors and economists will likely focus more on their forecasts than first-quarter results.

President Donald Trump's latest round of tariffs don't necessarily directly impact banks, although the potential downstream effects — namely inflation and slower economic growth — could throw a wrench into their projections this year and beyond.

What's more, analysts at JPMorgan point out that weaker global markets would lead to a decline in investment banking and wealth management fees, offset somewhat by higher trading revenue.

JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are among the big banks reporting Friday. Their shares dropped sharply at the end of last week but have recovered some losses the past two days.

The dominant group of U.S. stocks known as the “Magnificent Seven” is bouncing back, helping power the broad rally on Wall Street.

Chipmaker Nvidia and Tesla are leading the pack in midday trading with a gain of 5.5% and 5.4%, respectively. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet are all up between 3% and 2.1%.

The solid rebound comes a day after the a mixed finish for the group.

The “Magnificent Seven” are so massive in size, their movements carry more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes than other stocks.

Shares of major health insurers got a boost Tuesday after the federal government announced a better-than-expected 2026 payment increase for Medicare Advantage plans.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said Monday after markets closed that final rates are expected to increase more than 5% in 2026.

The rate increase is expected to cost taxpayers an additional $25 billion next year, CMS said.

Medicare Advantage plans are privately-run versions of the government-funded Medicare program mostly for people who are 65 and older.

Shares of the two largest Medicare Advantage plan providers, UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Humana Inc., climbed about 7% and 10%, respectively, Tuesday morning. Elevance Health Inc. and Centene Corp. rose nearly 4% each.

The health sector was among the biggest gainers in a broader market turnaround Tuesday.

Nvidia surged 5.3%, Broadcom jumped 7.6% and Advanced Micro Devices rose 3.5%. The companies and broader technology sector jumped amid hopes for negotiations over tariffs.

Chipmakers and other technology companies have an outsized impact on the broader market because of their pricey valuations. Big moves for the sector's most valuable companies can swing the market on their own or accentuate an already sharp move.

Technology companies have seen their values skyrocket over hopes for artificial intelligence advancements. Higher costs for chips and other technologies pose a risk to that development and the earnings growth prospects for those companies.

Visits to the U.S. from overseas fell 11.6% in March compared to the same month last year, according to preliminary government data.

Tourism industry experts suspect foreign travelers have been angered by President Donald Trumps' tariffs and rhetoric, and alarmed by reports of tourists getting arrested at the border.

The CEO of research institute that studies the preferences of Chinese tourists says leisure trips to places like Disneyland, Hawaii and New York are decreasing dramatically. He calls the trend the “Trump Slump.”

The Travel and Tourism Office data released Tuesday didn't include arrivals from Canada or land crossings from Mexico. Industry analysts are expecting U.S. visits by Canadians to drop significantly.

It depends on how businesses both in the United States and overseas respond, but consumers could see overall prices rising within a month or two of tariffs being imposed. For some products, such as produce from Mexico, prices could rise much more quickly after the tariffs take effect.



Some U.S. retailers and other importers may eat part of the cost of the tariff, and overseas exporters may reduce their prices to offset the extra duties. But for many businesses, the tariffs Trump announced Wednesday — such as 20% on imports from Europe — will be too large to swallow on their own.



Companies may also use the tariffs as an excuse to raise prices. When Trump slapped duties on washing machines in 2018, studies later showed that retailers raised prices on both washers and dryers, even though there were no new duties on dryers.



A key question in the coming months is whether something similar will happen again. Economists worry that consumers, having just lived through the biggest inflationary spike in four decades, are more accustomed to rising prices than they were before the pandemic.



Yet there are also signs that Americans, put off by the rise in the cost of living, are less willing to accept price increases and will simply cut back on their purchases. That could discourage businesses from raising prices by much.

Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said Tuesday that Thailand intends to send a high-ranking delegation to Washington to negotiate with their U.S. counterparts over the new tariff policies. 

Thailand is facing a 36% tariff under the new U.S. rules.

The decision to have a delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira was made after Paetongtarn held a meeting with her ministers of finance, foreign affairs an commerce, along with the Thai Trade Representative.

The Bangkok Post newspaper cited Pichai saying Thailand's plans include revising its import duties and amending non-trade barriers. 

Paetongtarn said the government had anticipated the issue and earlier this year established a U.S. Trade Policy Working Group to study developments and formulate a comprehensive response strategy. She said her government plans to roll out immediate relief for affected sectors, particularly small businesses and workers, while simultaneously crafting a broader economic overhaul to diversify export markets and boost national competitiveness.

Treasury yields are rising again in a potential signal that investors are gaining more confidence in the U.S. economy's path ahead.

The gains could also signal that investors expect more inflation ahead. Treasurys, which are often viewed as less risky investments than stocks, have been volatile amid worries about tariffs and the economy.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.24%, up from 4.17% late Monday and from 4.01% on Friday. Banks use the yield on the 10-year Treasury as a guide to pricing home loans.

The 10-year Treasury is often considered a proxy for the direction of mortgage rates.

The yield on the 2-year Treasury rose to 3.83% from 3.76% late Monday and from 3.64% late Friday. It often follows traders' expectations for the Federal Reserve's moves with short-term rates.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday spoke on the phone with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen saying China and Europe should boost communications, expand opening-up markets to each other and jointly defend free and open trade and investment. 

Li defended China's retaliatory measures to Trump's tariffs as not only safeguarding China's interests but also fighting for global trading rules. He said China and the EU can help provide “more stability and predictability” for each other and for the world, according to China's official news agency Xinhua. 

In the call, von der Leyen “underscored the vital importance of stability and predictability for the global economy,” according to the official readout on the phone call. She also stressed the responsibility of Europe and China, as two of the world's largest markets, to support a strong reformed trading system, which should be “free, fair and founded on a level playing field.”

The bounce back for global markets on Tuesday perhaps shouldn't be a surprise. Stocks don't go in one direction forever, and some of the best days in the market's history have been clustered around some of its worst days.

The biggest gain for the S&P 500 since World War II was an 11.6% surge on Oct. 13, 2008, for example. That was during the depths of the Great Recession, when worries were high that the financial system was collapsing and the S&P 500 was in the midst of a nearly 57% plunge from its peak in late 2007 until its bottom in March 2009. A couple weeks later, the index had another one of its best days in history, soaring 10.8%.

That's one of the reasons many financial advisers suggest not trying to time the market and selling stocks and other investments meant for the long term when nervous, because of the risk of missing out on such huge up days.

Small business owners' optimism slipped in March, as they dealt with looming tariffs and other new policies implemented by the Trump administration.

Optimism fell 3.3 points in March to 97.4, according to a poll by The National Federation of Independent Business, which is a widely used gauge of the economic health of small businesses.

The index fell slightly below the 51-year average of 98, following four months above the average.

“The implementation of new policy priorities has heightened the level of uncertainty among small business owners over the past few months.” said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. “Small business owners have scaled back expectations on sales growth as they better understand how these rearrangements might impact them.”

After hitting a new high last week, gold prices have tumbled following Trump's “Liberation Day.” But futures bounced back some Tuesday morning.

The price of New York spot gold hit all-time record on April 2, per FactSet, closing at about $3,134 per Troy ounce — the standard for measuring precious metals — just before Trump unveiled his self-described “reciprocal” tariffs. Prices fell in the days following, closing at nearly $2,982 Monday.

A rebound could be ahead. Futures jumped up to over $3,032 Tuesday morning.

Interest in buying gold typically spikes in times of uncertainty, as anxious investors seek a “safe haven” for parking their money. Many of Trump's previously-imposed tariffs have helped fuel gold's gains in recent months, even amid stock market turmoil. But precious metals are also volatile assets, so the future is never promised.

Levi Strauss executives said on a conference call with investors late Monday said that any price increases it undertakes related to tariffs would be “surgical,” instead of broad-based.

Shares of Levi Strauss rose 9% in early trading after the jeans maker posted better first-quarter profit than Wall Street forecast and said it expected “minimal” impact from tariffs in the second quarter.

“Most of the product for spring, early summer is already in the U.S.,” said chief financial officer Harmit Singh.

Just how much President Donald Trump's widespread tariffs would affect pricing has been a major concern for investors and analysts because tariffs generally act as a tax that gets passed on to consumers.

Levi earned 38 cents-per-share in the first quarter, easily topping the 28 cents-per-share that analysts forecast.

Economists at Goldman Sachs have raised their assessment of the odds the U.S. will experience a recession — where the economy shrinks and unemployment rises — to 45%, from 35%. Other economists are raising similar alarms, with JPMorgan putting the odds of a recession at 60% and projecting inflation will reach 4.4% by the end of this year, up from 2.8% currently.

Here's a few things to know about recessions and how they work: 

Are there any signs a recession is imminent?

Not yet. But one development that has sparked widespread fear is a real-time economy tracker maintained by the Federal Reserve's Atlanta branch. As of Monday, it was indicating that the economy could shrink by 0.8% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from 2.4% in last year's final quarter.

What signals would suggest that a recession has begun?

The clearest signal would be a steady rise in job losses and a surge in unemployment. The government's weekly report on the number of people seeking unemployment benefits, which is released every Thursday, is being closely watched for signs of rising layoffs. So far, applications for aid remain quite low by historical standards.

What are Trump and his officials saying?

President Donald Trump doubled down on his global tariffs Thursday, likening the U.S. economy to a ‘very sick' patient who came out of an operation. “It's gonna be a booming country, very booming country. It's going to be amazing, actually,” Trump said to reporters aboard Air Force One on his way down to one of his Florida golf clubs.

On Sunday, Trump told reporters that “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” Yet Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on the same day said “there doesn't have to be a recession” and that the administration is focused on “building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity.”

Tesla stock market value has lost nearly $400 billion since the S&P 500 hit a peak on Feb. 19, a stunning 35% plunge. The index, by contrast, has fallen 17%.

Investors pushed Tesla stock to a record high after Donald Trump was elected on hopes Musk's close ties would help the company. Instead, car buyers angry at Musk's support for Trump and other right-wing politicians have boycotted his company.

A sharp decline Monday put Tesla's stock at $233.29 and below its price on March 19, a key date. That is when Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made a surprising endorsement, urging Fox TV viewers to buy the stock in violation of a federal law banning government officials from endorsing companies.

Shares recovered somewhat in premarket trading Tuesday.

Futures for the S&P 500 gained 1.7% before the bell, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 2.1%. Nasdaq futures climbed 1.5%.

Among the early gainers in premarket trading are Humana, up 14%, CVS, up 9.5%, and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, up 6.8%.

If you're just getting read in for the day, here's a look at what happened overnight:

China still has a range of options to strike back at the Washington, experts say, including suspending cooperation on combating fentanyl, placing higher quotas on agricultural products and going after the U.S. trade in services in China such as finance and law firms.

U.S. total goods trade with China was an estimated $582 billion in 2024, making it the top trader in goods with the U.S. The 2024 deficit with China in goods and services trade was between $263 billion and $295 billion.

In Hong Kong, where stocks were slightly higher Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee said the city would link its economy closer to China's development, sign more free trade agreements, attract more foreign companies and capital to Hong Kong, and support local enterprises in coping with the impact of the tariffs.

World shares and U.S. futures advanced Tuesday, led by gains in Tokyo where the Nikkei 225 shot up just over 6% as markets calmed somewhat after the shocks from Trump's tariff hikes.

The modest rebound for most markets followed a wild day on Wall Street, where stocks careened after Trump threatened to crank his double-digit tariffs higher.

Germany's DAX gained 0.9% to 19,975.81 while the CAC 40 in Paris was up 1.3% at 7,018.79. Britain's FTSE 100 also picked up 1.3%, to 7,804.73.

Hong Kong also recovered some lost ground, but nothing close to the 13.2% dive Monday that gave the Hang Seng its worst day since 1997, during the Asian financial crisis.

The Hang Seng gained 1% to 20,036.03. The Shanghai Composite index jumped 1.4% to 3,140.15 after the government investment fund Central Huijin directed state-owned companies to help support the market with share purchases.

China said Tuesday it would “fight to the end” and take countermeasures against the United States to safeguard its own interests after Trump threatened an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports.

The Commerce Ministry said the U.S.‘s imposition of “so-called ‘reciprocal tariffs'” on China is “completely groundless and is a typical unilateral bullying practice.”

China, the world's second-largest economy, has announced retaliatory tariffs and the ministry hinted in its latest statement that more may be coming.

“The countermeasures China has taken are aimed at safeguarding its sovereignty, security and development interests, and maintaining the normal international trade order. They are completely legitimate,” the ministry said.

“The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the U.S. China will never accept this. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end,” it added.

Florida is No. 1 in the final Associated Press Top 25 men's college basketball poll of the 2024-25 season after winning the national championship.

The Gators (36-4) received all 61 first-place votes Tuesday, the second year the AP has released its last poll after the completion of the NCAA Tournament. Todd Golden's team beat Houston 65-63 on Monday night to clinch the program's third national title and first since Billy Donovan's repeat titles in 2006 and 2007.

The win also lifted Florida to the top spot in the poll for the first time since the last four polls of the 2013-14 season.

“Obviously we have an incredibly talented group, one of the most talented groups individually in America,” Golden said after the title-clinching win. “I do think what separates us and has separated us all season long is our team talent, how our guys have played together and for each other all year. Because of that, we can call each other national champions for the rest of our lives.”

Houston (35-5) remained at No. 2 after its first title-game appearance since 1984, capping a season that saw Kelvin Sampson's Cougars reach the Final Four for the second time in five seasons and beat Duke (35-4) in the national semifinals with a shocking late comeback.

The Blue Devils — who were No. 1 in the last two polls before March Madness — were third in what amounted to a swap with the Gators as the only change to the top quartet. Auburn (32-6) stayed at No. 4 after falling to Florida in the Alamodome, rounding out only the second all-chalk Final Four of 1-seeds since seeding began in 1979.




Tennessee was fifth and Alabama sixth, joining Florida and Auburn as the headliners for the Southeastern Conference in a year in which the league regularly had the most AP Top 25 teams on the way to earning a record 14 tournament bids.

Michigan State was next at No. 7, followed by Texas Tech, which had Florida on the brink of defeat in the Elite Eight before Gators star Walter Clayton Jr. sparked a wild comeback. A Big Ten duo of Maryland and Michigan rounded out the top 10.

Purdue had the biggest jump, rising eight spots to No. 14 after a Sweet 16 loss to Houston on a last-second basket on a perfectly executed inbounds play. No. 12 Kentucky and No. 15 Arizona were next, each rising six spots after their own runs to the tournament's second week.

In all, 12 teams moved up from the pre-tournament poll into their final position.

Louisville had the biggest tumble, falling 11 spots to No. 21 after the Cardinals entered March Madness ranked 10th but received only an 8-seed and suffered a first-round loss to Creighton. Fellow Atlantic Coast Conference program Clemson was next with a 10-spot tumble to No. 22 after a first-round loss to 12th-seeded McNeese.

No. 25 Memphis fell nine spots after being shorthanded in a loss to 12th-seeded Colorado State, while No. 11 St. John's fell six spots after shooting 28% in its second-round loss to Arkansas.

In all, eight teams fell from the pre-tournament poll. 

John Calipari's Arkansas Razorbacks checked in at No. 20 after reaching the Sweet 16, joining No. 18 Ole Miss as the final poll's two additions. Like Arkansas, the Rebels upended a higher-seeded team (Iowa State) to reach the second weekend. Both were ranked previously this season.

Missouri (No. 23) and Oregon (No. 25) fell out from the pre-tournament poll.

The SEC led the way with eight ranked teams, a haul that included No. 19 Texas A&M. The Big 12 and Big Ten were next with five ranked teams each, followed by the ACC with three. The West Coast Conference had two and the American Athletic Conference and Big East each had one.

Florida's rise to No. 1 meant five different teams held the top spot of the AP Top 25 this season, starting with Kansas for the preseason and the first four weeks of the regular season. Tennessee followed for five weeks, then Auburn for eight and finally Duke for the last two pre-tournament polls. In all, 50 teams spent at least one week in the poll this season.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican and Democratic members of the House Armed Services Committee voiced sharp bipartisan criticism Tuesday about reports the Trump administration is eyeing a reduction of U.S. forces in Europe, saying America must stick with its NATO allies.

Rep. Michael Rogers, R-Mich., the panel's chairman, said the U.S. must not cut troop levels in Europe and added that he was opposed to any plan for the U.S. to relinquish NATO command. The U.S. historically has held the Supreme Allied Command Europe, or SACEUR, position.

“U.S. leadership in NATO is essential to ensure armed American forces, including our nuclear weapons, always remain under U.S. command,” Rogers said at the start of a hearing with Army Gen. Christopher G. Cavoli, commander of U.S. European Command and the NATO commander.

Rep. Michael Turner, R-Ohio, added that “the idiocy of the fact that there was any discussion” about giving up the SACEUR role “is just beyond me.”

Katherine Thompson, who is doing the job of assistant defense secretary for international affairs, repeatedly told lawmakers that there is an ongoing Pentagon review of troop totals and no decisions have been made. But, asked again two hours into the hearing whether the U.S. would give up the SACEUR job, she said, “my definitive answer is no.”

That was the first time Pentagon officials have flatly denied the U.S. will give up that post, which Cavoli said gives him a strong voice and American leadership at NATO.




There have been roughly 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe in recent years, a 20,000-troop increase since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

Cavoli told the committee that he has recommended the U.S. maintain its current force totals. He said that cutting American troops in Europe will increase the time it would take America's military to respond to any crisis there. 

“Clearly moving things to the other side of the Atlantic increases the time-space challenge,” he said. He added that the current size and capability of the U.S. force, aided by allied contributions, “is deterring Russia” right now.

Asked by Rep. Don Bacon, R-Ill., if the Trump administration is considering plans to pull two rotational brigades out of Europe, Cavoli said there is a constant review of troop levels. He said the discussions generally revolve around readiness and modernization concerns by the military services.

Bacon responded that any reduction would be a grave mistake and a sign of American weakness.

Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the committee's ranking Democrat, also urged ongoing U.S. support to Europe and Ukraine and criticized President Donald Trump, saying the Republican has empowered Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Trump has pushed for an end to Russia's war in Ukraine but scaled back support for Ukraine when he came back into office. And he has said Europe must take responsibility for its own security.

Cavoli said that NATO allies “are investing in defense at a rate we haven't seen since the Cold War” and that there has been a 40% increase overall since the war in Ukraine began.

Thompson was chastised by Smith and other lawmakers for saying there is a ceasefire in Ukraine.

“There is no ceasefire. Let's just be clear about that,” said Smith, adding that Russia's bombing continues. 

Thompson also struggled under questioning about Trump's repeated warm statements toward Putin and his characterization that Ukraine started the war. She said Trump's goal is a ceasefire.

Rep. Salud Carbajal, D-Calif., snapped at Thompson: “You keep providing answers that are just canned and don't really answer many of the questions that have been asked by our colleagues today.”

Thompson also said the U.S. is being honest with NATO allies that they need to step up in their defense funding, calling European nations free-riders. She declined to answer questions about senior U.S. national security leaders using a Signal chat to discuss details of a planned military operation against the Yemen-based Houthi rebels.

She said she adheres to security protocols.

Food lovers around the country are crowing about Claude the Claw from takeout spot Birdbox, the hottest new hit on Broadway. Chris Calin of Birdbox talks about the chicken sandwich with one leg attached.

Fried chicken isn't just a food anymore. 

It's also a paste.

KFC recently introduced a fried chicken-flavored toothpaste.

President Donald Trump was asked by a reporter on Air Force One about how long DOGE chief Elon Musk will stay in his position.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with the Trump administration and upheld the mass firing of tens of thousands of probationary federal employees, granting a request for an emergency administrative stay on a lower court order blocking the firings.

The majority of the high court ruled that the plaintiffs, nine non-profit organizations who had sued to reinstate the employees, lacked standing to sue. 

"The District Court's injunction was based solely on the allegations of the nine non-profit-organization plaintiffs in this case. But under established law, those allegations are presently insufficient to support the organizations' standing," the court said in an order. 

Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson would have denied the application for a stay.

JUDGE BOASBERG POISED TO HOLD TRUMP ADMIN IN CONTEMPT, TAKES DOWN NAMES OF DHS OFFICIALS: 'PRETTY SKETCHY'

In their final brief to the Supreme Court, government attorneys argued that lower courts overstepped their authority by ordering the reinstatement of probationary employees last month.

The legal battle stems from the termination of an estimated 16,000 probationary federal employees since President Donald Trump took office, prompting a wave of lawsuits from Democrat-led states and former workers.

Probationary employees are particularly vulnerable to termination because they lack the civil service protections granted to full-time federal workers, which typically take effect after a designated period of service.

Justice Department lawyers have warned that forcing the government to rehire those employees would create "chaos" across federal agencies. They have also maintained that the firings were tied to poor performance – an allegation the dismissed employees strongly dispute.

JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP ADMIN FROM FIRING FEDERAL PROBATIONARY WORKERS

Last month, a federal judge in Baltimore ordered the Trump administration to reinstate probationary employees who had been fired from multiple government agencies.

Chief Judge James Bredar also directed the administration to return within seven days with a list of the affected employees and an explanation of how the agencies were complying with the reinstatement order.

In their Supreme Court filing, the plaintiffs argued that the Trump administration's "decimation" of probationary staff had caused deep and lasting harm to key federal agencies.

At the Department of Veterans Affairs – already plagued by chronic understaffing – the layoffs have "already had and will imminently continue to have" serious negative consequences for those who rely on its services, the plaintiffs wrote.

"Similarly, cuts to the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have already harmed and will continue to harm the ability of Respondent environmental and outdoor organizations to enjoy and protect a wide range of federal lands and resources," they said.

The plaintiffs, represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, argued that the terminations have already caused significant disruption across the federal government, impairing agencies' ability to carry out critical functions.

Most recently, a federal judge in Maryland expanded an order this week requiring the Trump administration to rehire terminated probationary federal employees. The ruling also barred the administration from carrying out future mass firings of probationary staff unless done in accordance with federal laws governing employee removals.

That includes providing affected employees with a 60-day notice period, as required under current civil service regulations.

In a Supreme Court filing, Solicitor General John Sauer argued that the lower court's injunction had forced the Trump administration to rehire federal workers "despite agencies' judgments about what best serves their missions."

"Courts do not have license to block federal workplace reforms at the behest of anyone who wishes to retain particular levels of general government services," the government wrote in its brief.

The administration argues that reinstatement is not an appropriate remedy in this case, claiming it exceeds the court's authority – and that even if the terminations were deemed "unlawful," that still would not justify such a sweeping order.

MSNBC guest and Princeton professor Eddie Glaude argued during an interview on Monday that voters chose Trump, who he said wants to destroy the republic, because they "didn't want to elect a Black woman."

Princeton professor Eddie Glaude called out voters who supported President Donald Trump in the 2024 election on Monday during an MSNBC interview, arguing those 78 million people voted for someone who wants to "destroy the republic" because they "didn't want to elect a Black woman."

"I don't know what it's going to take for 78 million Americans to deal with what motivated them to make this, and the choice that they've made, we have to just be honest, is to literally throw the republic into the trash bin," Glaude told MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace.

Glaude and Wallace were discussing the Supreme Court temporarily freezing a lower court order that required the Trump administration to return by midnight a Maryland resident, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador last month. The government has acknowledged that Garcia's removal from the U.S. was an "administrative error."

"We chose a felon who is more interested in loyalty, who is more interested in retribution, who is more interested in grift than in democracy, and we chose a felon because we didn't want to elect a Black woman," Glaude continued.

"So to read that, to actually explicate that is to say we would rather destroy the republic than for that to have happened, and until we grapple with it, there's no amount of protesting I could do, there's no amount of resistance that could come into play to actually force 78 million people to grapple with what motivated them to put themselves in this position," he added. 

Wallace agreed with Glaude, with the host saying, "you're right in that 78 million people voted for someone who wants to shred the Constitution."

He further argued that discrimination was at the center of Trump's support.

"There's this sense, this tragic dimension of the American project where the extension of basic democratic principles, the idea that dignity and standing should be accorded to anyone, no matter their gender, no matter where they're from, no matter their color. That has been challenged because some people believe that, by definition, they ought to be superior to others, and that the country should be organized in such a way to ensure that fact. And we have been willing to do monstrous things in defense of it," Glaude said. 

"People have been using it in some ways, Nicole, for their own self-interest," he added.

Glaude similarly criticized Trump supporters in December, a month after the president was elected. 

While speaking to Wallace on her show in December 2024, he insisted that hatred, greed and selfishness were at the center of Trump's political movement.

"So we have the collision of greed and hatred right in front of us and that's at the heart of Trumpism, of MAGAism. It's always been greed, always been selfish, it's always been hatred, and now it's in full, full view," Glaude said.

He said in November that Trump had won because "Whiteness" was under threat, receiving some pushback from MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle at the time.

"So there's this sense, right, that Whiteness is under threat – the demographic shifts. The country is – all of these racially ambiguous children on Cheerios commercials are confusing the hell out of me," he said during a Nov. 8 appearance on Ruhle's "The 11th Hour."

Ruhle said, "Eddie, a lot of people voted because their life's too damn expensive." Glaude dismissed the notion that people voted for Trump because prices were high during the conversation.

"They voted for a crook, a person who they know is doing everything to undermine the so-called country that they love. And then they're telling us the BS, that it's economics. We know that's not true. We know it's not true," Glaude added.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's top trade negotiator came under fire Tuesday from senators unnerved by the president's sweeping global tariffs, a market meltdown and the heightened risk of recession from an upended global trading order. 

“It seems like we've decided to begin a trade war on all fronts,″ said Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina. He said he wanted to know who in the Trump administration he should hold responsible — and “choke″ — if the tariffs fail and Americans suffer from higher prices and slower economic growth. “I wish you well,″ he told U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. ”But I am skeptical.''

Greer addressed the Senate Finance Committee a day after global markets swung wildly and some business leaders lambasted the president's aggressive bid to raise tariffs on almost every nation on earth. 

Greer testified that Trump's tariffs are already getting results, convincing “about 50'' countries to come to the negotiating table to reduce their own trade barriers. He said, for example, that Vietnam is cutting its own tariffs on apples, almonds and cherries. The import taxes are designed to reduce America's massive trade deficits, but Greer conceded that it will take time and that the adjustment might ”be challenging at times.''

Lawmakers, including Republicans, are getting jittery about Trump's trade wars, especially since stocks collapsed after he announced broad tariffs last Wednesday. The market rebounded Tuesday on hopes that negotiations will convince the president to lower or suspend the tariffs, the biggest of which are set to take effect at midnight Wednesday.




Several senators demanded that Greer explain what the administration was seeking to accomplish. At various times, Trump has said the tariffs were meant to raise money for the Treasury, bring manufacturing back to the United States, protect domestic industries and get other countries to make concessions.

“What is the plan?'' said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, top Democrat on the finance committee. “In the last week, the White House has been all over the map when it comes to these tariffs. There is no clear message about how they were determined, what they're supposed to accomplish, how long they will be in place, whether they're a negotiating tool or a move to try and cut the United States off from global trade and usher in a new era of 1870s-style protectionism.''

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said he would oppose the tariffs if they are intended only to raise revenue for the federal government, and not to open foreign markets to American exports.

The Constitution gives Congress authority to set taxes, including tariffs. But lawmakers have gradually ceded that authority to the White House. 

Trump has been especially aggressive about using the powers of the presidency to impose his trade agenda. He claimed emergency authority to impose his massive tariffs last Wednesday. He earlier used the same powers to hit Chinese, Canadian and Mexican imports.

Trump also has bypassed Congress to tax steel, aluminum and auto imports on the grounds that they pose a national security threat to the United States.

Now lawmakers — including some Republicans — are suggesting that Congress needs to reassert its authority over trade.

“Donald Trump's aimless, chaotic tariff spree has proven beyond a doubt that Congress has given far too much of its constitutional power over international trade to the executive branch,” Wyden said. “It is time to take that power back.''

Grassley, the Iowa Republican, and Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington last week introduced legislation that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to Congress. Lawmakers would then have 60 days to approve the tariffs. Otherwise, they would expire.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune showed no sign that he would allow a vote on a bipartisan bill that would exert congressional oversight of Trump's tariffs.

“I don't think that has a future,” Thune said of a bill from Grassley and Cantwell.

Watch live from the New York Stock Exchange.

Some relief is flowing through financial markets worldwide Tuesday as stocks bounce to recover a bit of their historic losses since President Donald Trump dramatically raised the stakes in his trade war last week.

The S&P 500 was up 3.7% in morning trading, though it still remains more than 14% below its record set in February. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1,363 points, or 3.6%, as of 10:12 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 4.2% higher.

What to know:

The dominant group of U.S. stocks known as the “Magnificent Seven” is bouncing back, helping power the broad rally on Wall Street.

Chipmaker Nvidia and Tesla are leading the pack in midday trading with a gain of 5.5% and 5.4%, respectively. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet are all up between 3% and 2.1%.

The solid rebound comes a day after the a mixed finish for the group.

The “Magnificent Seven” are so massive in size, their movements carry more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes than other stocks.

Shares of major health insurers got a boost Tuesday after the federal government announced a better-than-expected 2026 payment increase for Medicare Advantage plans.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said Monday after markets closed that final rates are expected to increase more than 5% in 2026.

The rate increase is expected to cost taxpayers an additional $25 billion next year, CMS said.

Medicare Advantage plans are privately-run versions of the government-funded Medicare program mostly for people who are 65 and older.

Shares of the two largest Medicare Advantage plan providers, UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Humana Inc., climbed about 7% and 10%, respectively, Tuesday morning. Elevance Health Inc. and Centene Corp. rose nearly 4% each.

The health sector was among the biggest gainers in a broader market turnaround Tuesday.

Nvidia surged 5.3%, Broadcom jumped 7.6% and Advanced Micro Devices rose 3.5%. The companies and broader technology sector jumped amid hopes for negotiations over tariffs.

Chipmakers and other technology companies have an outsized impact on the broader market because of their pricey valuations. Big moves for the sector's most valuable companies can swing the market on their own or accentuate an already sharp move.

Technology companies have seen their values skyrocket over hopes for artificial intelligence advancements. Higher costs for chips and other technologies pose a risk to that development and the earnings growth prospects for those companies.

Visits to the U.S. from overseas fell 11.6% in March compared to the same month last year, according to preliminary government data.

Tourism industry experts suspect foreign travelers have been angered by President Donald Trumps' tariffs and rhetoric, and alarmed by reports of tourists getting arrested at the border.

The CEO of research institute that studies the preferences of Chinese tourists says leisure trips to places like Disneyland, Hawaii and New York are decreasing dramatically. He calls the trend the “Trump Slump.”

The Travel and Tourism Office data released Tuesday didn't include arrivals from Canada or land crossings from Mexico. Industry analysts are expecting U.S. visits by Canadians to drop significantly.

It depends on how businesses both in the United States and overseas respond, but consumers could see overall prices rising within a month or two of tariffs being imposed. For some products, such as produce from Mexico, prices could rise much more quickly after the tariffs take effect.



Some U.S. retailers and other importers may eat part of the cost of the tariff, and overseas exporters may reduce their prices to offset the extra duties. But for many businesses, the tariffs Trump announced Wednesday — such as 20% on imports from Europe — will be too large to swallow on their own.



Companies may also use the tariffs as an excuse to raise prices. When Trump slapped duties on washing machines in 2018, studies later showed that retailers raised prices on both washers and dryers, even though there were no new duties on dryers.



A key question in the coming months is whether something similar will happen again. Economists worry that consumers, having just lived through the biggest inflationary spike in four decades, are more accustomed to rising prices than they were before the pandemic.



Yet there are also signs that Americans, put off by the rise in the cost of living, are less willing to accept price increases and will simply cut back on their purchases. That could discourage businesses from raising prices by much.

Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said Tuesday that Thailand intends to send a high-ranking delegation to Washington to negotiate with their U.S. counterparts over the new tariff policies. 

Thailand is facing a 36% tariff under the new U.S. rules.

The decision to have a delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira was made after Paetongtarn held a meeting with her ministers of finance, foreign affairs an commerce, along with the Thai Trade Representative.

The Bangkok Post newspaper cited Pichai saying Thailand's plans include revising its import duties and amending non-trade barriers. 

Paetongtarn said the government had anticipated the issue and earlier this year established a U.S. Trade Policy Working Group to study developments and formulate a comprehensive response strategy. She said her government plans to roll out immediate relief for affected sectors, particularly small businesses and workers, while simultaneously crafting a broader economic overhaul to diversify export markets and boost national competitiveness.

Treasury yields are rising again in a potential signal that investors are gaining more confidence in the U.S. economy's path ahead.

The gains could also signal that investors expect more inflation ahead. Treasurys, which are often viewed as less risky investments than stocks, have been volatile amid worries about tariffs and the economy.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.24%, up from 4.17% late Monday and from 4.01% on Friday. Banks use the yield on the 10-year Treasury as a guide to pricing home loans.

The 10-year Treasury is often considered a proxy for the direction of mortgage rates.

The yield on the 2-year Treasury rose to 3.83% from 3.76% late Monday and from 3.64% late Friday. It often follows traders' expectations for the Federal Reserve's moves with short-term rates.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday spoke on the phone with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen saying China and Europe should boost communications, expand opening-up markets to each other and jointly defend free and open trade and investment. 

Li defended China's retaliatory measures to Trump's tariffs as not only safeguarding China's interests but also fighting for global trading rules. He said China and the EU can help provide “more stability and predictability” for each other and for the world, according to China's official news agency Xinhua. 

In the call, von der Leyen “underscored the vital importance of stability and predictability for the global economy,” according to the official readout on the phone call. She also stressed the responsibility of Europe and China, as two of the world's largest markets, to support a strong reformed trading system, which should be “free, fair and founded on a level playing field.”

The bounce back for global markets on Tuesday perhaps shouldn't be a surprise. Stocks don't go in one direction forever, and some of the best days in the market's history have been clustered around some of its worst days.

The biggest gain for the S&P 500 since World War II was an 11.6% surge on Oct. 13, 2008, for example. That was during the depths of the Great Recession, when worries were high that the financial system was collapsing and the S&P 500 was in the midst of a nearly 57% plunge from its peak in late 2007 until its bottom in March 2009. A couple weeks later, the index had another one of its best days in history, soaring 10.8%.

That's one of the reasons many financial advisers suggest not trying to time the market and selling stocks and other investments meant for the long term when nervous, because of the risk of missing out on such huge up days.

Small business owners' optimism slipped in March, as they dealt with looming tariffs and other new policies implemented by the Trump administration.

Optimism fell 3.3 points in March to 97.4, according to a poll by The National Federation of Independent Business, which is a widely used gauge of the economic health of small businesses.

The index fell slightly below the 51-year average of 98, following four months above the average.

“The implementation of new policy priorities has heightened the level of uncertainty among small business owners over the past few months.” said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. “Small business owners have scaled back expectations on sales growth as they better understand how these rearrangements might impact them.”

After hitting a new high last week, gold prices have tumbled following Trump's “Liberation Day.” But futures bounced back some Tuesday morning.

The price of New York spot gold hit all-time record on April 2, per FactSet, closing at about $3,134 per Troy ounce — the standard for measuring precious metals — just before Trump unveiled his self-described “reciprocal” tariffs. Prices fell in the days following, closing at nearly $2,982 Monday.

A rebound could be ahead. Futures jumped up to over $3,032 Tuesday morning.

Interest in buying gold typically spikes in times of uncertainty, as anxious investors seek a “safe haven” for parking their money. Many of Trump's previously-imposed tariffs have helped fuel gold's gains in recent months, even amid stock market turmoil. But precious metals are also volatile assets, so the future is never promised.

Levi Strauss executives said on a conference call with investors late Monday said that any price increases it undertakes related to tariffs would be “surgical,” instead of broad-based.

Shares of Levi Strauss rose 9% in early trading after the jeans maker posted better first-quarter profit than Wall Street forecast and said it expected “minimal” impact from tariffs in the second quarter.

“Most of the product for spring, early summer is already in the U.S.,” said chief financial officer Harmit Singh.

Just how much President Donald Trump's widespread tariffs would affect pricing has been a major concern for investors and analysts because tariffs generally act as a tax that gets passed on to consumers.

Levi earned 38 cents-per-share in the first quarter, easily topping the 28 cents-per-share that analysts forecast.

Economists at Goldman Sachs have raised their assessment of the odds the U.S. will experience a recession — where the economy shrinks and unemployment rises — to 45%, from 35%. Other economists are raising similar alarms, with JPMorgan putting the odds of a recession at 60% and projecting inflation will reach 4.4% by the end of this year, up from 2.8% currently.

Here's a few things to know about recessions and how they work: 

Are there any signs a recession is imminent?

Not yet. But one development that has sparked widespread fear is a real-time economy tracker maintained by the Federal Reserve's Atlanta branch. As of Monday, it was indicating that the economy could shrink by 0.8% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from 2.4% in last year's final quarter.

What signals would suggest that a recession has begun?

The clearest signal would be a steady rise in job losses and a surge in unemployment. The government's weekly report on the number of people seeking unemployment benefits, which is released every Thursday, is being closely watched for signs of rising layoffs. So far, applications for aid remain quite low by historical standards.

What are Trump and his officials saying?

President Donald Trump doubled down on his global tariffs Thursday, likening the U.S. economy to a ‘very sick' patient who came out of an operation. “It's gonna be a booming country, very booming country. It's going to be amazing, actually,” Trump said to reporters aboard Air Force One on his way down to one of his Florida golf clubs.

On Sunday, Trump told reporters that “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” Yet Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on the same day said “there doesn't have to be a recession” and that the administration is focused on “building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity.”

Tesla stock market value has lost nearly $400 billion since the S&P 500 hit a peak on Feb. 19, a stunning 35% plunge. The index, by contrast, has fallen 17%.

Investors pushed Tesla stock to a record high after Donald Trump was elected on hopes Musk's close ties would help the company. Instead, car buyers angry at Musk's support for Trump and other right-wing politicians have boycotted his company.

A sharp decline Monday put Tesla's stock at $233.29 and below its price on March 19, a key date. That is when Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made a surprising endorsement, urging Fox TV viewers to buy the stock in violation of a federal law banning government officials from endorsing companies.

Shares recovered somewhat in premarket trading Tuesday.

Futures for the S&P 500 gained 1.7% before the bell, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 2.1%. Nasdaq futures climbed 1.5%.

Among the early gainers in premarket trading are Humana, up 14%, CVS, up 9.5%, and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, up 6.8%.

If you're just getting read in for the day, here's a look at what happened overnight:

China still has a range of options to strike back at the Washington, experts say, including suspending cooperation on combating fentanyl, placing higher quotas on agricultural products and going after the U.S. trade in services in China such as finance and law firms.

U.S. total goods trade with China was an estimated $582 billion in 2024, making it the top trader in goods with the U.S. The 2024 deficit with China in goods and services trade was between $263 billion and $295 billion.

In Hong Kong, where stocks were slightly higher Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee said the city would link its economy closer to China's development, sign more free trade agreements, attract more foreign companies and capital to Hong Kong, and support local enterprises in coping with the impact of the tariffs.

World shares and U.S. futures advanced Tuesday, led by gains in Tokyo where the Nikkei 225 shot up just over 6% as markets calmed somewhat after the shocks from Trump's tariff hikes.

The modest rebound for most markets followed a wild day on Wall Street, where stocks careened after Trump threatened to crank his double-digit tariffs higher.

Germany's DAX gained 0.9% to 19,975.81 while the CAC 40 in Paris was up 1.3% at 7,018.79. Britain's FTSE 100 also picked up 1.3%, to 7,804.73.

Hong Kong also recovered some lost ground, but nothing close to the 13.2% dive Monday that gave the Hang Seng its worst day since 1997, during the Asian financial crisis.

The Hang Seng gained 1% to 20,036.03. The Shanghai Composite index jumped 1.4% to 3,140.15 after the government investment fund Central Huijin directed state-owned companies to help support the market with share purchases.

China said Tuesday it would “fight to the end” and take countermeasures against the United States to safeguard its own interests after Trump threatened an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports.

The Commerce Ministry said the U.S.‘s imposition of “so-called ‘reciprocal tariffs'” on China is “completely groundless and is a typical unilateral bullying practice.”

China, the world's second-largest economy, has announced retaliatory tariffs and the ministry hinted in its latest statement that more may be coming.

“The countermeasures China has taken are aimed at safeguarding its sovereignty, security and development interests, and maintaining the normal international trade order. They are completely legitimate,” the ministry said.

“The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the U.S. China will never accept this. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end,” it added.

Live Updates


            • Tariff turmoil: President Donald Trump threatened to add new 50% tariffs on China if Beijing doesn't remove its retaliatory duties by today. The president said “he's not looking” at a pause in enforcing the sweeping tariffs he announced last week as fears of a global recession mount. Meanwhile, Trump's US trade representative is defending the administration's expansive tariffs in a Senate committee hearing currently underway.
    


            • Legal battle: A federal judge in Washington, DC, canceled today's scheduled hearing on the request for a preliminary injunction against Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations following yesterday's Supreme Court ruling allowing the administration to enforce the wartime authority for rapid deportations for now.
    


            • Data-sharing deal: The Internal Revenue Service and Department of Homeland Security finalized an agreement to provide sensitive taxpayer data to federal immigration authorities — including information about certain undocumented immigrants, according to court filings.
    


            The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed the Trump administration to keep several thousand probationary federal employees it is attempting to fire off the payroll while lower courts weigh whether the downsizing efforts are legal, another win for the White House in recent days.
    


            The Supreme Court's decision blocks a ruling from a lower court judge that required the government to reinstate more than 16,000 probationary employees.
    


Keep in mind: The decision is not the final word on whether the employees will be allowed to keep their jobs, but it will have a significant impact on both the workers and the agencies in the meantime.
    


            Two liberal justices – Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson – publicly dissented.
    


            The full implications of the ruling are not clear given that a federal judge in Maryland earlier this month issued a preliminary injunction that reinstated some of the employees not covered in the case before the Supreme Court.
    


            Key GOP senators acknowledged the short-term economic disruption of tariffs and expressed hope that negotiations will eventually roll back President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariff policy.
    


            Sen. John Cornyn told CNN that he thinks his constituents understand “the principle of reciprocity” and pointed to Texas cattle raisers being unable to sell beef in Australian markets.
    


            Cornyn said he and his colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee would ask US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in a hearing on the administration's trade policy on Tuesday, “What's the ultimate goal here?”
    


            “If the goal is zero tariffs and truly free trade, I think that's a huge win for President Trump,” he said.
    


            Presser on if constituents will stomach higher prices, Cornyn answered, “Any time you're gonna have a change in the status quo, there's gonna be some disruption, by definition.”
    


            “How this story ends is the most important thing and hopefully it ends quickly,” he added.
    


            Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, who has introduced a bipartisan bill to rein in Trump's tariff powers, said farmers in his state are concerned about “input costs.”
    


            Grassley said he thinks Greer “signaled that the purpose of the tariffs are to bring people to the negotiating table.”
    


            “If the president does that, that's a satisfactory answer,” he continued.
    


            President Donald Trump will sign an executive order to “reinvigorate” coal, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
    


            Trump is scheduled to participate in an executive order signing event today to “unleash American energy” at 3 p.m. ET, according to the White House. Leavitt also confirmed in a social media post that the president's executive order will seek to tap into coal.
    


            “Coal is critical to achieving American Energy and AI Dominance,” she said.
    


            Trump has consistently voiced his intention to leverage US coal, along with oil, natural gas and nuclear power. The president has also expressed a broader effort to undo the energy policies implemented by former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.
    


            A senior House Democrat is planning to force a vote to terminate President Donald Trump's steep global tariffs that have rattled American consumers and could soon raise the prices of everything from groceries to gasoline, according to a person familiar with the plans.
    


            A day before Trump's tariffs are set to take effect, New York Rep. Gregory Meeks will soon introduce a measure that would use Congress' power to overrule the White House on trade policy.
    


            His resolution — which is expected to be deemed “privileged,” which means it will come to the floor despite GOP leadership opposition — would end the tariffs announced by the White House on April 2.
    


            If it is indeed privileged, as both parties expect, the vote must come up within 15 days.
    


            It is unlikely to succeed, given the White House has already warned it would override any potential measure. But Democrats want to force House Republicans to decide whether they'll back the president or attempt to prevent price hikes.
    


            US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee that the Trump administration's trade concerns will likely not be fixed anytime soon, but stood by President Donald Trump's tariff actions as a step in the right direction.
    


                    “Our large and persistent trade deficit has been over 30 years in the making, and it will not be resolved overnight,” Greer told the committee during a routine hearing. “But all of this is in the right direction, particularly as we start to negotiate with these countries.”
                





Here's what to know:



Remember: Trump's sweeping tariffs have targeted all US trading partners, and the International Chamber of Commerce has said that'll raise the risk of global trade tensions spiraling out of control. If that happens, that could send inflation skyrocketing and weaken economic growth.
    


            A Russian foreign ministry delegation will hold planned talks with the United States on Thursday in Istanbul, Turkey, according to the Kremlin.
    


            The Russian delegation will be led by Russian Ambassador to the US Alexander Darchiev and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Russia and Central Europe, Sonata Coulter, state media TASS reported on Tuesday, citing the foreign ministry.
    


            The talks “will be devoted to normalizing the work of the embassies,” TASS said.
    


            Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier that the meeting follows the round of discussions between Moscow and Washington in Istanbul on February 27, which focused on working to ease tensions and restore bilateral contacts.
    


            The US State Department called the previous talks in Istanbul “constructive discussions.”
    


            The Kremlin spokesperson said at a press briefing today that Russia would continue conducting the negotiations through its foreign ministry, adding that further updates would be provided by the ministry.
    


            The European Union is prepared to negotiate with the United States over buying more of its liquefied natural gas, according to the bloc's executive arm.
    


            On Monday, US President Donald Trump said the EU must buy around $350 billion worth of American LNG to compensate for the deficit the US has in goods trade with the bloc.
    


            Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, a spokesperson for the European Commission, told reporters Tuesday: “Half of our LNG already comes from the United States, and we are ready, going forward, to work with Trump administration. We are ready to discuss. We're ready to negotiate.”
    


            Itkonen also said the EU intends to keep its “energy sources diverse” to avoid becoming too dependent on any one supplier.
    


            The bloc had “learned (its) lesson,” she said, from its experience having to rapidly replace its imports of Russian piped natural gas and oil following Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The EU has ramped up its imports of American LNG to help plug that gap.
    


            America was the bloc's biggest supplier of LNG in 2024, representing a 45% share of those imports, according to the commission.
    


            Trump said yesterday that America's goods deficit with the EU could “disappear easily and quickly” if the bloc bought more American energy.
    


More context: Trump has repeatedly said that the US runs a $350 billion deficit in goods trade with the EU. Although there is a large discrepancy between the deficit figures cited by the EU and US because of the different ways they are calculated, neither figure is anywhere near as large as what Trump has claimed.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today that moves to negotiate on tariffs have “nothing to do with the market,” but are the “result of the massive inflow” of calls to President Donald Trump.
    


                    “Negotiations are the result of the massive inflow of inbound calls to come and negotiate; it had nothing to do with the market,” Bessent told CNBC, noting that 70 countries have reached out to open tariff talks with the US.
                





            US stocks mostly fell after an extremely volatile day yesterday — tumbling, surging and then bouncing around in every direction, as traders searched for any sign that Trump's tariffs could be negotiated or halted.
    


            “We were having a discussion last night about which countries to prioritize, and I think you are going to see some very large countries with large trade deficits come forward very quickly,” Bessent said. “If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals,” he added, noting the president will be personally involved in negotiations.
    


            As CNN reported yesterday, Bessent flew to Mar-a-Lago over the weekend with a message to the president on tariffs: zero in on the endgame.
    


            “I went down to see President Trump, as I do many weekends, and I can tell you, it's all President Trump's decision. And he had a view on after Liberation Day, that we should go into quiet mode and let our partners think about the kind of the shock and awe that he presented,” Bessent said when asked about his message to the president.
    


CNN's David Goldman, John Towfighi and Matt Egan contributed reporting to this post. 



            Republican senators who are supporting the bipartisan effort to rein in President Donald Trump's tariff powers said today that they think Congress should be able to hold the administration accountable.
    


            Sen. Thom Tillis told CNN he's mostly hearing from businesses in his state and concerns about the “cost of inputs.” On constituent reaction, he said it's “only beginning to trickle in now. If you think about when the tariffs were implemented, you won't see these costs for another week or two as things come onshore.”
    


            Pressed on the impact on farmers, Tillis called it a “stability issue” for businesses, adding, “We've got a lot of uncertainty.”
    


            He said he plans to ask US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday about “who's on point” on trade policy.
    


                    “In business, you always come up with decisions. You create one throat to choke. I'm just trying to figure out who I should compliment or who I should hold accountable,” he said.
                





            Tillis, who is up for reelection next year, is a cosponsor of a bipartisan bill meant to reassert congressional authority and rein in the president's ability to unilaterally level tariffs. Trump has already said he'll veto it, and Senate Majority Leader Thune has signaled he's not eager to bring it to the floor.
    


            Sen. Todd Young, who has also signed onto the bill, told CNN that Congress should “play a meaningful role when it comes to developing revenue measures, whether it's taxes or tariffs.”
    


            Young said Trump needs “broad discretion” to enforce “whatever Congress develops and implements,” adding that he's been working with the administration on enforcing existing tariff laws. He said the White House has “engaged in a dialogue” on tariffs and has been “helpful and responsive,” and “we're waiting now for more information on their next steps.”
    


            White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said the administration is managing “a massive number of requests for negotiations” from nations to avoid having “reciprocal” tariffs levied on them starting at 12:01 a.m. ET. Wednesday.
    


            Hassett added that Trump “prioritizes two of our closest allies and trading partners: Japan and Korea,” he said in a Tuesday morning Fox News interview. “The word out of those conversations was really positive.”
    


            Earlier on Tuesday, Trump posted on Truth Social that he had “a great call with the Acting President of South Korea.” On Monday, Trump also spoke with Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who will be sending a team to visit Washington to negotiate a trade deal.
    


            Japan was the top-fifth source of foreign goods shipped to the United States last year, while South Korea was the seventh, according to federal trade data.
    


            A dispute appears to have escalated between two of President Donald Trump's top advisers over the wisdom of the new tariffs the president has applied to dozens of countries.
    


            Elon Musk, the billionaire who has become Trump's most powerful adviser, has criticized the tariffs and lashed out against trade adviser Peter Navarro, after Navarro dismissed the Tesla founder as a “car assembler.”
    


                    “Navarro is truly a moron,” Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.
                





            Later, defending Tesla's Made-in-America credentials, Musk wrote that “Tesla has the most American-made cars.”
    


                    “Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks,” Musk wrote.
                





            Musk has advocated against the new tariffs, including in public remarks and private conversations with Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.
    


            Judge James Boasberg has canceled today's scheduled hearing on the request for a preliminary injunction against Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations following last night's Supreme Court ruling.
    


Remember: The Supreme Court yesterday allowed President Donald Trump to enforce the Alien Enemies Act for now, handing the White House a significant victory that will let immigration officials rely on a sweeping wartime authority to rapidly deport alleged gang members.
    


            The unsigned decision in the case, one of the most closely watched emergency appeals pending at the Supreme Court, lets Trump invoke the 1798 law to speed removals while litigation over the act's use plays out in lower courts. The court stressed that going forward, people who are deported should receive notice they are subject to the act and an opportunity to have their removal reviewed by the federal court where they are being detained.
    


            The court's three liberal justices dissented from the decision, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a member of the court's conservative wing, partially dissented.
    


CNN's John Fritze and Devan Cole contributed reporting. 



            Attorney General Pamela Bondi called Monday's Supreme Court decision allowing the administration to rapidly deport alleged gang members a “landmark victory for the rule of law.”
    


                    “This is a landmark victory for the rule of law, and this is what we've been arguing on behalf of President Trump,” she told Fox News from the White House on Tuesday.
                





More on the ruling: The court allowed President Donald Trump to enforce the Alien Enemies Act while litigation over the act's use plays out in lower courts. The court stressed that going forward, people who are deported should receive notice they are subject to the act and an opportunity to have their removal reviewed by the federal court where they are being detained.
    


            “It's a habeas hearing in the court of confinement, which means in Texas, so it will be a much faster hearing. They can't do class actions. It will be a much smoother, simpler hearing and these people will be deported,” Bondi said.
    


            When pressed by CNN's Alayna Treene as to why the Justice Department believes a mistakenly deported Maryland man with protected legal status should remain in a mega prison in El Salvador, Bondi doubled down on the administration's original response to the error.
    


            “It was an administrative error as to why he was deported, and he is a known gang member,” the attorney general said. “ICE testified he was a gang member, and we believe he should stay where he is.”
    


            The government initially alleged Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia was part of the MS-13 gang, but there is not a court case linking him to the group.
    


            President Donald Trump said he had a “great call” with South Korea's acting president this morning, noting that they have the “confines” of a deal for both countries and that a negotiating team is on its way to the US.
    


            “Their top TEAM is on a plane heading to the U.S., and things are looking good,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
    


                    “We are likewise dealing with many other countries, all of whom want to make a deal with the United States. Like with South Korea, we are bringing up other subjects that are not covered by Trade and Tariffs, and getting them negotiated also. ‘ONE STOP SHOPPING' is a beautiful and efficient process!!!”
                





            Trump, however, specifically called out China — on which he's threatened additional tariffs — saying, “China also wants to make a deal, badly, but they don't know how to get it started. We are waiting for their call. It will happen!”
    


            Trump said he spoke with South Korea about tariffs and military protection.
    


            He went on to project optimism about a deal. “In any event, we have the confines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries,” he wrote.
    


            President Donald Trump is expected to meet with a group of House Republicans who have expressed opposition in voting for the GOP budget resolution, two sources tell CNN.
    


            The meeting is expected to be at 1 p.m. ET.
    


            CNN reported Monday that House Speaker Mike Johnson, facing significant work ahead of him to garner enough support for the Senate's budget blueprint, is meeting with holdouts and stressing the need for urgency at this stage of the process. He threatened weekend work if the House can't get the budget passed by Thursday.

            After markets plunged over the course of the past three trading sessions, Wall Street investors were looking for any excuse to catch their breath ahead of another planned tariff escalation at midnight.
    


            They seem to have found one — at least for now.
    


            US stocks opened higher Tuesday, setting the stage for a rebound. The Dow rose 1,360 points, or 3.6%. The broader S&P 500 gained 3.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 3.76%.
    


            However, there's no guarantee stocks will remain buoyant.
    


            After imposing across-the-board 10% tariffs on virtually all products coming into the United States Saturday, the Trump administration is set to impose significantly steeper levies still on dozens of countries. Those tariffs, which Trump has called “reciprocal,” although they are no such thing, amount to as much as 50% for a handful of countries — and some tariffs on China could rise to about 70%.
    


            Trump also threatened to slap an extra 50% tariff on China if the country doesn't back down from its retaliatory tariffs it announced Friday. China's Commerce Ministry on Tuesday said the country would “fight to the end” of the trade war and would continue to stand up to Trump.
    


            President Donald Trump's US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is expected to defend the administration's tariffs in remarks before the Senate Finance Committee at a hearing this morning.
    


                    “Last Wednesday, President Trump declared a national emergency in response to the large and persistent trade deficit that has built up in recent years,” Greer said, according to a copy of his prepared remarks obtained by CNN. “This deficit is driven in part by non-reciprocal tariffs, trading barriers, and other economic policies pursued by our foreign trading partners. President Trump imposed tariffs to address this emergency.”
                





            Greer is expected to further say that the president's “strategy is already bearing fruit” and that nearly “50 countries have approached me to discuss the President's new policy and explore how to achieve reciprocity.”
    


            Greer's hearing is scheduled to start at 10 a.m. ET.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expects businesses will take a wait-and-see attitude to find out how trade negotiations between the United States and its trading partners play out before they make any decision on building new plants in America. But he said they are preparing to make such a move.
    


            “Business leaders have substantial lead time,” Bessent said in an interview on CNBC this morning. “I'm sure that they are putting together plans for what they would like to do when we finish these negotiations.”
    


            President Donald Trump has promised his tariff plan will create a manufacturing boom in the United States. But Bessent acknowledged that won't happen overnight.
    


                    “They're not going to snap their fingers, find a green field site and build a factory,” he added. “But I am sure that the planning has already started in board rooms. I spent the weekend talking to CEOs and investment bankers and that's exactly what's happening.”
                





            The Internal Revenue Service and Department of Homeland Security finalized an agreement Monday to provide sensitive taxpayer data to federal immigration authorities, according to court filings.
    


            As part of the deal, the IRS agreed to turn over information about undocumented immigrants that DHS says are already facing deportation orders and are under federal criminal investigation, according to the filings.
    


            The agreement was signed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
    


            President Donald Trump's foreign envoy Steve Witkoff will lead the US side in talks over a new nuclear deal with Iran, a person familiar with this weekend's meeting in Oman confirmed to CNN.
    


            The administration believes, as Trump said yesterday, that these will be direct talks between the two sides, the source said.
    


            But Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said talks with Witkoff will be indirect, Iran's semi-official media outlet Tasnim News reported earlier today.
    


            Oman will mediate the talks, according to Tasnim, despite Trump saying yesterday that direct talks between the US and Iran had already begun.
    


            The two parties will discuss Iranian denuclearization, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.
    


            “It is as much an opportunity as it is a test. The ball is in America's court,” Araghchi said on X yesterday.
    


Some background: Tehran and Washington have not engaged in direct formal talks since the Obama administration negotiated the Iran nuclear deal in 2015, when Iran gave up most of its nuclear capability in return for better integration into the global economy.
    


            Iran restarted its nuclear programs after Trump quashed that deal in 2018.
    


Israeli reaction: The talks are “certainly not” to Israel's liking, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            Trump announced them while seated next to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office yesterday. The sudden revelation appeared to surprise Netanyahu, with a smile quickly vanishing from his face as he looked toward his team of advisers. It's unclear if Netanyahu was given an advance notice or if he was consulted ahead of time, the sources said.

            President Donald Trump doesn't look like he's going to blink.
    


            Chaos and fear unleashed by his “Liberation Day” trade war has only made him more adamant about his lifelong conviction that the world's greatest economy is a victim of cheating rivals bent on ripping it off.
    


            Trump did say Monday he's open to trade talks with powers like Japan and Israel. The prospect of nascent negotiations meant there was no repeat of gargantuan losses of last week on US markets.
    


            But he also threatened to raise cumulative tariffs on China to over 100% — a move that could lead to massive price increases for US shoppers for iPhones, computers and toys. He also implied that the America's erstwhile friends in the European Union were such implacable foes that there can never be a fair deal.

            China's Commerce Ministry says it “firmly opposes” the additional 50% tariffs on Chinese imports threatened by President Donald Trump on Monday, calling it “a mistake upon a mistake.”
    


            “If the United States implements the escalating tariff measures, China will resolutely take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests,” the ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.
    


            It denounced Trump's “reciprocal tariffs” as “completely unfounded” and “typical unilateral bullying.”
    


                    “The US threat to escalate tariffs is a mistake on top of a mistake, which once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the US. China will never accept this. If the US insists on its own way, China will fight to the end,” the ministry said.
                





            Reiterating that there are no winners in a trade war, the ministry emphasized that “pressure and threats are not the right way to engage with China.”
    


            “We urge the US to immediately correct its erroneous practices, cancel all unilateral tariff measures against China, stop suppressing China in the economic and trade sphere, and resolve differences properly through equal dialogue based on mutual respect,” the statement added.
    


            Stock markets around the world rose Tuesday after a major rout the previous day, fueled by fears over the economic fallout of US President Donald Trump's new tariffs.
    


            Most Asian stock indexes closed higher:
    


            Across Europe:
    


            US stock futures were also higher. The Dow index was on track to open 1.8% up and the S&P 500 index 1.6% higher. For the tech-heavy Nasdaq index, futures pointed to a 1.6% rise at the open.
    


            The big headline from Monday evening was a significant White House victory.
    


            The Supreme Court allowed Donald Trump to enforce the Alien Enemies Act for now, which will let immigration officials rely on a sweeping wartime authority to rapidly deport alleged gang members.
    


            Trump wrote on Truth Social yesterday that it was “a great day for justice in America.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Less than one hour before the stock market closed on Monday, journalists gathered in the Oval Office for their only chance of the day to ask President Donald Trump about the turmoil caused by his tariff plans. 

Are the new tariffs, scheduled to take effect on Wednesday, a bargaining chip to reach better trade deals? Or are they etched in stone in a mission to revamp the global economy?

Investors around the world were hanging on Trump's every word, but he did little to clear up the situation.

“It can both be true,” he said. “There can be permanent tariffs, and there can also be negotiations.”

The markets skidded to a close. At a time when foreign leaders and business executives are desperate for clarity, the White House is sending mixed messages as it pursues conflicting goals.

Advisers have tried with some success to tamp down a days-long stock selloff by talking up tariffs as a starting point for negotiations, which could mollify Wall Street and jittery Republicans in Congress. The S&P 500 stock index opened up 3.4% on Tuesday. But the president continues to insist that he can raise hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue with his new taxes on foreign imports, and he's shown no willingness to back down from an agenda that he's advocated for decades, even before entering politics. 

The ongoing paradox could erode confidence in Trump's leadership at home and abroad after he promised a booming economy and tax cuts, not depleted retirement accounts and fears of a recession. For now, as the tariffs are set to kick in, there's no clear resolution for what could be the most significant overhaul of international trade in a generation.

Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, urged the White House to “settle the situation.”




He said the “perception as to whether or not there's an end game is very important.” Tillis said he is “giving the administration the benefit of the doubt” for now. But he added: “You've got to get it done as quickly as you can get it done.”

The administration has yet to articulate its goals for any talks with trading partners, other than to suggest that negotiations could take several months and that nations might also need to dramatically overhaul their tax systems and regulations to satisfy Trump's demands. Canadian and European officials are uncertain about how to proceed even as Trump administrations officials insist that as many as 70 nations are looking to start negotiations.

Trump insists that he wants to erase trade deficits that have developed as the U.S. buys more products from other countries than it sells. On Tuesday morning, Trump posted on Truth Social that he spoke with South Korea's acting president, Han Duck-soo, about “their tremendous and unsustainable” surplus. 

“We have the confines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries,” he wrote. “Their top TEAM is on a plane heading to the U.S., and things are looking good.”

But on Monday, when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would “eliminate the trade deficit with the United States,” Trump appeared unmoved. 

Asked if he would hold off on new tariffs on Israel, the president said “maybe not.” 

“Don't forget, we help Israel a lot,” he said, citing billions of dollars in military assistance to the country. 

Trump has long advocated for tariffs as the solution to economic challenges, and his insistence that other countries are ripping off the United States is one of his most consistently expressed beliefs over the years.

Last Thursday, while flying to Florida aboard Air Force One, Trump told reporters that “the tariffs give us great power to negotiate.”

On the flight back to Washington on Sunday, Trump described the tariffs as a necessity and said he was undeterred by the cratering stock market, adding that “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”

Peter Navarro, a leading trade adviser, has also taken a hard line.

“This is not a negotiation,” Navarro wrote in the Financial Times. “For the U.S., it is a national emergency triggered by trade deficits caused by a rigged system.”

But other officials like Kevin Hassett, the top White House economic adviser, and Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, said scores of countries are lining up to negotiate with Trump over tariffs.

“It's going to be a busy April, May, maybe into June,” Bessent told Fox News. He said Trump “gave himself maximum negotiating leverage, and just when he achieved the maximum leverage, he's willing to start talking.”

Speaking Monday at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, Stephen Miran, chairman of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, said the mixed messages over the purpose of the tariffs reflected a “healthy” internal debate.

“There are conflicting narratives because everybody has got an opinion,” he said. “And that's fine. Disagreement is how you can enhance your arguments and avoid groupthink, and I think that's very healthy.”

As for whether any deals could be reached before the tariffs take effect, Miran said, “that choice will ultimately remain with the president.”

Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said some of Trump's aides “just like to talk.”

“There's some uncertainty about what the president's objective is and I think that's a product of some of his aides, who gave conflicting reports on TV this weekend,” he said.

Kennedy said he supports Trump's trade goals. But he's also getting calls from businesses in his state, and he's had no answers for them on what to expect.

Trump is constitutionally barred from running for president again, despite his talk about serving a third term. However, Republicans face elections next year that could reshape control of Congress, and they've been more nervous about the president's plans. 

Bessent visited with lawmakers on Friday, the day after the tariff announcement. Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said Bessent told them that the tariffs were a “high level mark with the ultimate goal of getting them reduced” unless other countries retaliated.

“The president is a dealmaker if nothing else, and he's going to continue to deal country by country with each of them,” Barrasso said afterward.

But China already retaliated with plans for its own 34% tariffs, prompting Trump on Monday to threaten additional 50% tariffs against the country.

The U.S. president had a positive enough conversation with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba that the Nikkei stock index jumped 6% on Tuesday, yet it was still unclear how a deal would work. 

Trump placed a 24% tariff on Japan and a separate 25% tariff on auto imports, much higher than the 1.9% average tariff rate charged by Japan, according to World Trade Organization data. Trump has called the auto tariffs “permanent” and also installed a permanent 10% baseline tariff on most countries, suggesting a limit as to how much rates could fall through negotiations.

But Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota made it clear he hopes the tariffs are part of a flexible strategy that leads to the reciprocal dropping of tariffs.

“I think most people here, like most Americans, are watching and waiting to see what the ultimate policy implementation will be,” he said Monday.

On the other side of the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana emphasized his trust in the president.

Johnson argued the country had a $1.2 trillion trade deficit last year and Americans understand Trump is trying to address that.

“We are going to give him the space necessary to do it,” he said Monday.

Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley discusses the Supreme Court's ruling in favor of President Donald Trump on deportation flights and the dissent from Justice Sotomayor.

The federal judge who blocked the Trump administration's use of a 1798 wartime law to immediately deport Venezuelan nationals canceled a planned Tuesday court hearing to review the case after the Supreme Court handed a win to the president.

In a minute order published Tuesday morning, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg announced that the previously scheduled Tuesday afternoon hearing would be vacated in light of the high court's ruling – which determined, among other things, that the "appropriate venue for such proceedings is the Southern District of Texas," or wherever plaintiffs that are subject to potential removal are currently held.

The 5-4 Supreme Court ruling established due process protections for migrants, including the right to appear in court before they are deported. 

Boasberg ordered that plaintiffs in the case must file a notice by April 16 indicating whether they believe that they still have a basis to proceed on their motion for preliminary injunction in the D.C. Court.

National Republican Congressional Committee chair Rep. Richard Hudson tells Fox News Digital 'we have to raise enough money to keep up with the Democrats and make sure that our candidates can get their message out'

FIRST ON FOX — As congressional Republicans gear up for a bruising battle in the 2026 midterm elections to hold onto their razor-thin House majority, President Donald Trump is stepping up his efforts as well.

The president on Tuesday evening will headline a major donor event in the nation's capital for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), which is the House GOP's campaign arm. 

The fundraiser is expected to haul in at least $10 million for the NRCC, a source familiar with the event tells Fox News.

Republicans currently control the House – when the chamber returns to full strength – with a fragile 220-215 majority, and fundraising will be crucial to the GOP's game-plan to keep control.

Asked what concerns him the most when it comes to defending the House majority, NRCC chair Rep. Richard Hudson said in a Fox News Digital interview on Monday that "Democrats have a structural advantage when it comes to fundraising. They always seem to have just mountains of money. So I think the amount of money the Democrats raise is probably the only thing that really concerns me."

"We have to raise enough money to keep up with the Democrats and make sure that our candidates can get their message out," Hudson emphasized.

Hudson, a North Carolina Republican and 12-year veteran of the House, said that "the President understands that he's got to keep the House majority in the midterm so that he has a four-year runway, instead of a two-year runway to get his agenda enacted."

And pointing to the House Democratic leader, Hudson added, "Speaker Hakeem Jeffries would fight President Trump on every front, and it would be really difficult for him to achieve his agenda. President Trump understands it's important to hold the House and he's, he's been extremely helpful to us and we appreciate it."

WERE LAST WEEK'S ELECTIONS IN WISCONSIN AND FLORIDA A CRYSTAL BALL FOR THINGS TO COME IN NEXT YEAR'S MIDTERMS?

Hours before Trump was scheduled to attend the NRCC fundraiser, the House Democrats' campaign arm took aim at nearly three dozen Republican-held seats in the chamber as they aim to win back the majority.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) on Tuesday morning released its initial 2026 target list, which included 35 GOP-controlled seats, and launched an effort to fundraise for the party's eventual nominees in each of the districts.

The DCCC emphasized that their moves signal that "Democrats are on offense and poised to win the majority in 2026."

POLL POSITION: WHERE TRUMP STANDS WITH AMERICANS 11 WEEKS INTO HIS SECOND TOUR OF DUTY IN THE WHITE HOUSE

The unveiling of the DCCC list came three weeks after the NRCC went up with its initial target list, which took aim at 26 districts controlled by House Democrats.

"House Republicans are running scared, and they should be. They're tanking the economy, gutting Medicaid, abandoning our veterans, and making everything more expensive. In short, they've lost the trust of their constituents, and it's going to cost them the majority," DCCC Chair Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state charged in a statement announcing the moves.

While the party in power, which clearly is the Republicans, traditionally faces serious political headwinds in the midterm elections, the NRCC is optimistic they can defend their majority.

"If you look at the landscape for the 2026 election, there are only three Republicans in districts that [former vice president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee] Kamala Harris carried, but there are 13 Democrats in seats that Donald Trump carried, and half of those are majority Hispanic districts that President Trump has really put in play for us," Hudson reiterated.

The NRCC also points to the growing number of House Democrats who are seeking statewide office in 2026 rather than running for re-election.

Hudson said the trend would "absolutely" help the GOP defend the majority next year.

"It's much easier to win an open seat than a seat with a Democrat incumbent who's entrenched.," Hudson said. "I think it's incredibly helpful, and I think you're going to see a whole lot more Democrats running for other offices and retiring."

Olja Ivanic looked forward to welcoming some cousins from Sweden to her Denver home in June. Ivanic and the four travelers were planning to go hiking in Colorado and then visit Los Angeles and San Francisco.

But then President Donald Trump berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a February meeting at the White House. Ivanic's four relatives immediately canceled their scheduled trip and decided to vacation in Europe instead.

“The way (Trump) treated a democratic president that's in a war was beyond comprehensible to them,” said Ivanic, who is the U.S. CEO of Austria-based health startup Longevity Labs. 

The U.S. tourism industry expected 2025 to be another good year in terms of foreign travelers. The number of international visitors to the United States jumped in 2024, and some forecasts predicted arrivals from abroad this year would reach pre-COVID levels.

But three months into the year, international arrivals are plummeting. Angered by Trumps' tariffs and rhetoric, and alarmed by reports of tourists being arrested at the border, some citizens of other countries are staying away from the U.S. and choosing to travel elsewhere.

The federal government's National Travel and Tourism Office released preliminary figures Tuesday showing visits to the U.S. from overseas fell 11.6% in March compared to the same month last year. The figures did not include arrivals from Canada, which is scheduled to report tourism data later this week, or land crossings from Mexico. But air travel from Mexico dropped 23%. 




For the January-March period, 7.1 million visitors entered the U.S. from overseas, 3.3% fewer than during the first three months of 2024.

The travel forecasting company Tourism Economics, which as recently as December anticipated the U.S. would have nearly 9% more international arrivals this year, revised its annual outlook last week to predict a 9.4% decline. 

Tourism Economics expects some of the steepest declines will be from Canada, where Trump's repeated suggestion that the country should become the 51st state and tariffs on close trading partners have angered residents. Canada was the largest source of visitors to the U.S. in 2024, with more than 20.2 million, according to U.S. government data. 

Flight Centre Travel Group Canada, a travel booking site, said leisure bookings to U.S. destinations were down 40% in March compared to the same month a year ago. Air Canada has reduced its schedule of spring flights to Florida, Las Vegas and Arizona due to lack of demand.

The National Travel and Tourism Office gave a rosier forecast last month for international travel to the U.S. Based on 2024 travel patterns, the office said it expected arrivals to increase 6.5% to 77.1 million this year and surpass 2019 levels in 2026. 

But Tourism Economics said the impact of the less favorable view of the U.S. from abroad could be severe enough that international visits won't surpass pre-pandemic levels until 2029.

“The survey data is all indicating a significant mix of cancellations and a massive drop in intent to travel,” Tourism Economics President Adam Sacks said.

Ian Urquhart, a professor emeritus at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, was supposed to go to Las Vegas for five days in June and see Coldplay in concert. He canceled the trip to protest Trump's “incredibly disparaging tone” toward Canada even though it meant losing a $500 deposit on the vacation package. 

His oldest daughter similarly nixed a planned May trip to Sedona, Arizona, while his brother-in-law decided not to go on his usual weeklong golf trip to Scottsdale, Arizona, according to Urquhart.

“None of us jumped for joy when we made those decisions, but it seemed to be one of the few ways we could signal how we felt about the bullying that has been directed towards Canada by your president,” Urquhart said.

For Pepa Cuevas and her husband, who live in Madrid, Trump's election in November was a turning point. The couple had planned to spend a month skiing in Colorado over the winter holidays. They went to Japan instead.

“Trump's victory left us, especially me, very shocked,” Cuevas said. “For the moment, we have lost the desire to return. I don't know what will happen in the future, but for the moment we are still shocked, and it doesn't look like this is going to be resolved.”

According to the government data released Tuesday, international arrivals from China were down nearly 1%. Leisure trips by Chinese citizens to places like Disneyland, Hawaii and New York are decreasing dramatically and likely won't pick up again until Trump has left office, said Wolfgang Georg Arlt, the CEO of the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute. He dubs it the “Trump Slump.”

That slump has financial consequences. Tourism Economics expects U.S. spending by international visitors to drop by $9 billion this year.

Marco Jahn is the president and CEO of New World Travel, a California company that works with overseas tour operators on vacation packages and activity planning. It arranges the hotels and rental cars for a family that wants to take a driving tour of U.S. national parks, for example. 

Jahn said bookings have dropped between 20% and 50%, depending on the source market, over the last eight to 10 weeks. He notes particular declines from Scandinavia, where Trump's repeated threat to take control of Greenland, a self-governing territory of NATO ally Denmark, has antagonized citizens. 

“The U.S. is not perceived as a welcoming destination,” Jahn said. 

Beyond, a revenue management platform for vacation rental owners, said Canadian searches for short-term rentals in the U.S. plunged 44% after Feb. 1, when Trump first announced a since-paused 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico. Florida, Texas and New York were among the hardest-hit markets, Beyond said.

American Ring Travel, a tour operator based in California, offers carbon-neutral bus tours of the U.S. that often attract eco-conscious travelers from Europe, said Richard Groesz, the company's director of contracting. But bookings from Germany flattened starting in January after Elon Musk threw his support behind a far-right political party in that country's federal election, Groesz said.

There are other issues impacting foreign visits. The U.S. has been the top destination by country for Japanese tourists for years, but data compiled by JTB Tourism Research & Consulting showed South Korea topped the U.S. in January.

The weak yen – not Trump – is likely the biggest factor dampening the attraction of the U.S., said Takaaki Mitamura, a spokesperson for Tokyo-based travel agent Veltra Corp. Travelers are picking destinations where the currency effect isn't as big, like South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Australia, he said.

Haruka Atomiya, a Tokyo resident, visits Los Angeles at least once a year. Last year, she brought her young children for the first time and did a lot of research to find affordable places to stay. The exchange rate made some hotels double or triple the price she paid in the past.

Atomiya, who went to college in Vermont, has always loved the diversity and the freedom in the U.S. She said she doesn't understand why Americans elected Trump, but doesn't plan to stop visiting unless she senses any physical danger.

“If America changes in a way that's clearly visible, that's a reality, too, and I will likely keep visiting,” she said. “What will happen to America after Trump intrigues me.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump was set Tuesday to help plant a young Magnolia tree on the South Grounds to replace a nearly 200-year-old predecessor that was removed due to safety concerns presented by its deteriorating condition. 

The Republican president had announced March 30 on his social media platform that the tree, known as the Jackson Magnolia, was in “terrible condition, a very dangerous safety hazard, at the White House Entrance, no less, and must now be removed.” 

The famous southern magnolia had stood for decades near the west side of the South Portico of the White House. It's where presidents and prime ministers often are welcomed on their visits, as well as where the president himself exits to board the Marine One helicopter or returns after a trip. 

According to the National Park Service website, “folklore tells us” that President Andrew Jackson brought the tree's seeds from his home near Nashville, Tennessee. The seeds apparently were planted in honor of his wife Rachel, who died shortly before he took office in 1829.

A 12-year-old sapling that is a direct descendant of the Jackson Magnolia will be planted in its place on Tuesday, the White House said. The National Park Service, which takes care of the White House grounds, said the sapling was grown at its offsite greenhouse specifically to replace the Jackson Magnolia.

The decision to remove the tree followed an assessment by Peter Hart, a registered consulting arborist and member of the American Society of Consulting Arborists, which concluded that the tree had “surpassed the time of serving as an aesthetic and historic landmark due to the potential harm it may cause because of the risk of structural failure,” the White House said.




Hart's report also recommended that the tree be removed as soon as possible “to eliminate the risk of personal injury and/or property damage,” according to the White House.

The National Park Service, the U.S. Secret Service, the White House grounds superintendent, the offices of the president and first lady, and other White House officials were involved in the decision. 

The park service will keep a sample of the downed tree for historical and archival purposes and transfer any remaining wood to the Executive Residence. Trump had said the wood “may be used for other high and noble purposes!!!!”

The tree was significantly pruned in 2017, during Trump's first term. It had suffered damage in 1994 when a small Cessna plane crashed onto the South Lawn and skidded into the White House.

In 2022, then-President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden planted a Southern Magnolia sapling on the grounds near the tree that was removed on Monday. That sapling was a descendant of another magnolia planted by Jackson.

This story has been updated to reflect that the White House has corrected that the report on the tree was done by a member of the American Society of Consulting Arborists, not the organization as a whole.

SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Florida's Walter Clayton Jr. came up with the perfect going-away present for that spirit-crushing Houston defense that bullied, battered and bedeviled him all night.

It was a defensive gem of his own. Right before the buzzer. For the win and the national title.

The Gators and Clayton somehow overcame Houston's lockdown intensity, along with a 12-point deficit Monday night to will out a 65-63 victory in an NCAA title-game thriller decided when the Florida senior's own D stopped the Cougars from even taking a game-winning shot at the buzzer.

Clayton finished with 11 points, all in the second half. What he'll be remembered for most was getting Houston's Emanuel Sharp to stop in the middle of his motion as he tried to go up for the game-winning 3 in the final seconds.

An NCAA title game clash of No. 1 seeds in San Antonio did not disappoint. Correspondent Gethin Coolbaugh reports.

“Just go 100 percent,” Clayton said when asked what he was trying to do at the finish. “We were just trying to get a stop, and we happened to get it. I'm happy we got it done.”

With Sharp looking for room, Clayton ran at him. The Houston guard dropped the ball and, unable to pick it up lest he get called for traveling, watched it bounce. 

Alex Condon dived on the ball, then flipped it to Clayton, who ran to the opposite free-throw line with the buzzer sounding and tugged his jersey out of his shorts. Next, the court was awash in Gator chomps and orange and blue confetti.

“We guarded them hard and then I saw the ball loose and I just hoped we beat them to the ball,” Florida coach Todd Golden said. 




This marked the fourth comeback in six March Madness wins for the Gators (36-4). They led this game for a total of 64 seconds, including the last 46 ticks of a contest that was in limbo until the final shot that never came.

Houston coach Kelvin Sampson called it “incomprehensible” that the Cougars couldn't get a shot off on either of their last two possessions.

About the last one, Sampson said: “Clayton made a great play. But that's why you've got to shot fake and get into the paint. Two's fine.”

Will Richard had 18 points to keep the Gators in it, and they won their third overall title and first since Billy Donovan went back-to-back in 2006-07. 

This time, it's Golden, in his third year, bringing the title back to Gainesville, where the Gator faithful can celebrate a win on one of college sports' grandest stages for the first time since Tim Tebow was playing quarterback for the football team in 2008.

This was the first hoops title for the Southeastern Conference since Kentucky in 2012, and the outcome the power conference was hoping for (expecting?) after placing a record 14 teams in the tournament.

The Cougars (35-5) and Sampson were denied their first championship, and ended up in the same spot as the colorful Phi Slama Jama teams from the 1980s — oh-so-close in second place.

This was a defensive brawl — the Gators failed to crack 70 for only the second time all season — and for most of the night, Clayton got the worst of it. 

He was 0 for 4 from the field without a point through the first half. Met at the top of the circle, then double-teamed and trapped when necessary, he didn't score until hitting two free throws with 14:57 left.

The player who scored at least 30 points in the last two games, who averaged 24.6 through the first five games of the tournament, who almost singlehandedly outscored UConn and Texas Tech down the stretch of those March Madness comebacks, finished with one 3-pointer. Before that, he had a pair of three-point plays off drives to the hoop that kept the Gators in striking range. He finished 3 for 10.

He also became part of not one, but two stops that put these Gators in the history book, and possibly cemented himself as the best basketball player to wear the orange and blue.

After Alijah Martin made two free throws to put Florida ahead 64-63 — its first lead since 8-6 — the Gators lured Sharp into a triple-team in the corner, where Clayton pressured him, and then Richard got him to dribble the ball off his leg and out of bounds.

Florida made one free throw on the next possession and that set up the finale. 

The ball first went to L.J. Cryer, who led the Cougars with 19 points. Blanketed by Richard, he threw to Sharp, who was moving to spot up for a 3 when Clayton ran at him. That left him with no choice but to let the ball go.

“It was a great defensive play by Walter,” Condon said. “I just dived on it, and hearing the buzzer go was a crazy feeling.”

Instead of the 69-year-old Sampson becoming the oldest coach to win the title, the 39-year-old Golden becomes the youngest since N.C. State's Jim Valvano in 1983 to win it all. 

This gut-wrenching loss came two nights after the Cougars fashioned a wild comeback of their own, from 14 down against Duke.

All three Final Four games were decided down the stretch, none by more than Florida's six-point win over Auburn on Saturday. Any thought that the men's game had been overtaken by the increasingly popular women will probably go on hold at least for a year.

The three women's Final Four games, capped by UConn's blowout of South Carolina on Sunday, were decided by an average of 24.7 points.

“When it gets down to the two best teams left,” Sampson said of the thriller he barely lost, “it's not going to be easy for either team.”

RNC national spokeswoman Elizabeth Pipko weighs in on the Democratic Party's internal calls for change on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' 

Sports commentator Stephen A. Smith declared that he is considering running for office in the next few years if he believes he can win.

Smith has risen to fame as a bombastic commentator in the realms of sports and politics. Previously, he denied he would ever run for president, saying recent chatter about doing so only took off due to Democrats' desperation for a leader. However, the ESPN host spoke at the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) convention in Las Vegas on Monday, where he stated that recent events have changed his mind.

He posted a link to a story on his comments on X and said, "Time to stop messing around. Life is great. Especially at ESPN/Disney. Hate the thought of being a politician. But sick of this mess. So I'm officially leaving all doors open."

"Over the last few weeks, I've had no choice but to get more serious about it," he said at the NAB event. "I've been approached by people on Capitol Hill. I've been approached by people who are elected officials in office, whether it's governors or mayors or what have you. People have legitimately, seriously, asked me about it."

He went on to repeat that while he does not want to become a politician, he will run for office if he thinks he has a viable path to victory.

"I have no desire to be a politician. My life is [going] pretty well, but I've decided that I'm no longer going to close that door," he said. "I'm gonna keep my options open. I'm going to entertain the possibility." 

Speaking of the future, Smith suggested, "If it comes in late 2026, 2027, where I look at this country and think it's an absolute mess and there's legitimate reason to believe - whether it's via exploratory committees or anything else - that I indeed have a legitimate shot to win the presidency of the United States. I am not going to rule it out, and I'm not playing." 

According to Forbes, he also reportedly derided politicians, saying, "I personally perceive politicians being professional beggars. You always have your hand out and people need something in return."

But even so, he said that as more and more people have urged him to become one "over the last few weeks, I had to get a little more serious about it."

Smith noted he would need to "hunker down for a couple of months" to study the various issues, but said he would look forward to debates.

"Imagine me on a debate stage with these people, these politicians," Forbes quoted Smith as saying. This is what I do for a living. I am not a politician. I don't have a political record for them to lean on. I can challenge what you literally say [as politicians]. They would all know more than me at this particular time, but they have a record to address."

"They better hope I'm not interested, I'll tell you that much," he added. "I don't like any of [the prospective 2028 candidates] right now."

China's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday vowed that the country would “fight to the end” and take countermeasures against the United States to safeguard its interests after President Donald Trump threatened an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports.

BEIJING (AP) — China said Tuesday it would “fight to the end” and take countermeasures against the United States to safeguard its own interests after President Donald Trump threatened an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports. 

The Commerce Ministry said the U.S.‘s imposition of “so-called ‘reciprocal tariffs'” on China is “completely groundless and is a typical unilateral bullying practice.” 

China, the world's second-largest economy, has announced retaliatory tariffs and the ministry hinted in its latest statement that more may be coming. 

“The countermeasures China has taken are aimed at safeguarding its sovereignty, security and development interests, and maintaining the normal international trade order. They are completely legitimate,” the ministry said. 

At a briefing, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee says the city will work with China.

“The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the U.S. China will never accept this. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end,” it added.




Trump's threat Monday of additional tariffs on China raised fresh concerns that his drive to rebalance the global economy could intensify a financially destructive trade war. Stock markets from Tokyo to New York have become more unstable as the tariff war worsens. 

Trump's threat came after China said it would retaliate against U.S. tariffs he announced last week.

“If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!”

If Trump implements his new tariffs on Chinese products, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would reach a combined 104%. The new taxes would be on top of the 20% tariffs announced as punishment for fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34% tariffs announced last week. Not only could that increase prices for American consumers, it could also give China an incentive to flood other countries with cheaper goods and seek deeper relationships with other trading partners, particularly the European Union.

On the streets of Beijing, people said they found it hard to keep track of all the announcements, but expressed belief in their country's ability to weather the storm. 

“Trump says one thing today and another tomorrow. Anyway, he just wants benefits, so he can say whatever he wants,” said Wu Qi, 37, who works in construction. 

Others were less sanguine. Paul Wang, 30, who sells stainless accessories, including necklaces, bracelets, and tongue studs to Europe, said the European market was now more important after the extra U.S. 50% tariffs and he would be watching to see which other firms in his field would be competing in that space.

Jessi Huang and Yang Aijia, whose companies import chemicals from the U.S., said the tariffs, including potential Chinese retribution, could force them to close up shop. 

“It would be very hard and very likely to have a layoff, maybe even closing,” Huang said, “I might not be able to find another job if I get laid off.” 

China still has a range of options to strike back at the Washington, experts said, including suspending cooperation on combating fentanyl, placing higher quotas on agricultural products and going after the U.S. trade in services in China such as finance and law firms. 

U.S. total goods trade with China was an estimated $582 billion in 2024, making it the top trader in goods with the U.S. The 2024 deficit with China in goods and services trade was between $263 billion and $295 billion.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian appeared to give short shrift to talk of dialogue with the Trump administration. 

“I don't think what the U.S. has done reflects a willingness for sincere dialogue. If the U.S. really wants to engage in dialogue, it should adopt an attitude of equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit,” Lin said. 

In Hong Kong, where stocks were slightly higher Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee blasted the latest U.S. tariffs as “bullying,” saying the “ruthless behavior” has damaged global and multilateral trade and brought great risks and uncertainties to the world.

Lee said the city would link its economy closer to China's development, sign more free trade agreements, attract more foreign companies and capital to Hong Kong, and support local enterprises in coping with the impact of the tariffs.

Associated Press writers Chris Megerian, Josh Boak and Fu Ting in Washington, Christopher Bodeen in Taipei, Taiwan, and Kanis Leung in Hong Kong contributed to this report.

President Donald Trump defends his reciprocal tariffs plan as an 'America first' move. 

Everyone is angry at Donald Trump. He keeps snatching away the honey pot; our NATO allies are incensed they have to provide more for their own defense, DOGE is axing taxpayer monies flowing illicitly to Democrats, and the president's tariff broadside has exposed trading imbalances that benefit everybody but the United States.

Trump hasn't just stirred the pot – he's turned it over and stomped it into smithereens. He is putting America first and is the first president in history to risk his presidency and legacy for working-class families. For that, he deserves much credit.

Here's a fact: with $37 trillion in federal debt, up from $23 trillion in 2019, the United States can no longer act as global Sugar Daddy, giving out treats to the entire world. 

TRUMP'S TOP ECONOMIC ADVISOR SAYS TARIFF PANIC IS ‘EXAGGERATED' AS STOCKS SINK

For decades our western allies relied on America to defend them against hostile totalitarian regimes while they spent their money on their own citizens, stitching together costly safety nets which included free healthcare and generous pensions. 

In his first term, Trump called out the freeloaders like Germany which had perennially failed to meet their NATO obligation to spend 2% of GDP on defense. Europeans were horrified, as they so often are by crass American bluntness. But slowly, begrudgingly, they have upped their outlays; the Ukraine war has driven home the necessity of greater self-sufficiency, as has more pressure from President Trump. It's about time. 

At home, the DOGE team is exposing not only hundreds of billions of dollars of wasteful government spending, but also the billions of taxpayer dollars craftily sent to innocent-sounding NGOs which then funnel those funds to Democrat-aligned activist groups.  Moreover, DOGE is promising to modernize our antiquated federal government; good for them. 

And now, the tariffs. 

KEVIN O'LEARY SAYS TRUMP'S BEEN OFFERED ‘OFF-RAMP' IN BID TO EASE TRADE TENSIONS

Donald Trump has railed about the U.S. being unfairly treated by our trading partners for decades. Thanks to him, 10 years ago the country's view of trade deals changed. Democrats had promoted them until Hillary Clinton ran against Trump in 2016, even as the number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. shrank from a peak of almost 20 million in 1979 to only 12 million.  

Donald Trump is putting America first and is the first president in history to risk his presidency and legacy for working-class families. For that, he deserves much credit.

At that time, the trade deal under consideration was the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which involved 11 Pacific Rim countries and was sponsored by the Obama White House, in which Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State.  As Politico noted in 2016, "Clinton raved about Trans-Pacific Partnership before she rejected it;" even leftist Politico described Clinton's hostility to the deal appeared a "campaign pose." The New York Times reported that the TPP became "a symbol of failed globalism and the loss of United States jobs overseas." On his first day in office, Trump formally abandoned the trade agreement. 

Trump believes that trade pacts like the TPP and the original North American Trade Agreement (signed into law by Bill Clinton) had pushed millions of jobs overseas to low-wage countries like Mexico and China. In 2016, he ran on redoing those deals; in office, one of his major accomplishments was passing the USMTA, a new deal with Mexico and Canada about which Vox wrote, "Trump's new trade deal is better for workers than NAFTA was." 

Now, in his second term, President Trump wants to go further, much further, in revising our trade arrangements. His goal is to bring manufacturing back to the U.S, and to that end he has announced draconian tariffs. Markets have swooned as investors and business leaders try to calculate the impact of Trump's moves. 

The tariffs, and especially how they were calculated, are controversial. While demanding reciprocal tariffs seems fair – why, for instance, should the EU charge a 10% duty on U.S.-made cars and we tax them only 2.5%? – basing the levy on the trade deficit we run with any given country, which appears to have been the approach, does not seem to make sense.  

BILL ACKMAN CALLS FOR 90-DAY 'TIME OUT' ON TARIFFS, OR RISK 'SELF-INDUCED, ECONOMIC NUCLEAR WINTER'

In recent days, numerous countries have asked to negotiate better terms. This is not surprising since the U.S. is, and will remain for the indefinite future, the world's largest consumer. We have the cards; it is essential that Trump plays them well. 

Unhappily, one of the dealers, White House Trade Advisor Peter Navarro, took to the airwaves Monday to shoot down Vietnam's offer to go to zero tariffs, demanding further concessions to account for "nontariff cheating." By that he meant, "Chinese products being routed through Vietnam, intellectual property theft and a value-added tax." Those are legitimate issues but for those hoping that President Trump will soon announce some agreements that lower tariffs and calm markets, Navarro's comments were disappointing.

After all, President Trump is known as a smart negotiator. In his book the "Art of the Deal" he explains the virtue of leading with an exaggerated demand, which allows for compromise. Presumably that is what he is doing now.

The White House is under pressure to bring the public on board. Trump's agenda, including extension of the 2017 tax cuts, could be in jeopardy if voters lose confidence and if the GOP loses control of Congress in the midterms.

Their several rationales for tariffs – righting unfair practices that have disadvantaged American workers, bringing in revenues and onshoring manufacturing - are all reasonable. To those who challenge the need to rebuild U.S. manufacturing, consider the national security implications of having a country providing mainly entertainment and financial services. Movies and IPOs do not win wars. Trump is right – we need to make steel, ships and weapons.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent promoted the president's tariffs over the weekend, telling Tucker Carlson: "I have a high confidence ratio, it's going to work."

He also said this: "Summer of 2024, Americans took more European vacations than they had in history. Summer of 2024, more Americans were using food banks than they ever have in history." 

That says volumes about our two-tier economy; far too many Americans are barely getting by. Let us hope that Trump's tariffs make a difference.

Randy Musterer tells Fox News Digital how a serial dine-and-dash thief was foiled by members of his waitstaff and how the trend of walking out on bills is detrimental to small businesses throughout the country. 

A string of recent crimes targeting small businesses throughout the country have industry experts on high-alert as owners warn the incidents could result in rising prices. 

Instances of dining-and-dashing – when an individual orders a meal at a restaurant and leaves without paying – have become more high-profile in recent months, with thieves becoming more brazen as they target small businesses across the United States.

Last month, a local California sushi restaurant chain became an unwilling target for a serial dine-and-dasher when a man stole approximately $1,000 worth of meals from multiple locations.

"Every little thing has a positive or negative effect on small businesses, so this definitely has an impact," Randy Musterer, founder and CEO of Sushi Confidential, told Fox News Digital. 

Musterer and his staff were on the lookout for a man who had reportedly walked out on the bill at two separate Sushi Confidential locations over the course of numerous visits. When the man returned to the restaurant's flagship location in Campbell, workers immediately recognized him as the alleged thief. 

"I got a phone call from one of our managers saying, ‘Oh my gosh, the guy who has been dining and dashing in our Campbell location, he's on the patio right now'," Musterer said.

Musterer and his team quickly devised a plan to confirm if the man intended on stealing his meal, ultimately handing him his check as his food was dropped off and waiting for him to immediately pay. When the man got up to use the bathroom, they knew they had the dasher. 

"The minute he got up, I knew something was going to go down," Musterer said. "Then I got a text message from the manager saying he ran out the front door." 

Musterer called the police and, after a brief search, the suspect was arrested for allegedly committing two thefts totaling approximately $140, according to the Campbell Police Department.

The suspect is charged with three counts of defrauding an innkeeper and is scheduled to be arraigned next month, the Santa Clara District Attorney's Office confirmed to Fox News Digital.

"No one likes to be taken advantage of," Musterer said. "Whether it's your money or someone else's money, when you just see something like this happen you want to grab the bull by the horns and help solve the problem yourself." 

Officials say the act of stealing from small businesses is not a victimless crime, and can have real-life repercussions for local business owners and their staff.  

"Dine-and-dash incidents create additional financial strains on restaurants that are already facing economic challenges," Sam Toia, president of the Illinois Restaurant Association, told Fox News Digital. "I always say that before the pandemic, the restaurant industry used to be an industry of nickels and dimes. Post-pandemic, it's turned into a business of pennies and nickels, and these dine-and-dash incidents are creating additional financial strains." 

Incidents involving dining-and-dashing have drawn widespread attention as offenders are repeatedly stealing from the same location or posting about their crimes online.

A few weeks after Musterer's dine-and-dash incident, another group of thieves made headlines for walking out on the bill at a Chicago restaurant. 

Three women visiting the city's Soul Vibez restaurant racked up a tab of over $200, ordering alfredo, chicken wings and multiple drinks while celebrating a birthday, Fox 32 first reported. 

After finishing their meal, the trio waited for their server to leave before ducking out of the restaurant, but not before reportedly posting a photo of their dinner on social media, tagging the restaurant and thanking them for the free food. 

Chicago police are investigating the incident and a police report has been filed, according to Fox 32. 

Soul Vibez and the Chicago Police Department did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Instances involving restaurant visitors walking out on their bills have been on the rise since the pandemic, according to Toia. Those within the restaurant industry insist the uptick in dine-and-dash offenses can force businesses to offset the losses onto consumers, raising prices for those who do pay their tabs. 

"It doesn't just hurt the restaurant owner, it also hurts the team members," Toia said. "It hurts waitstaff, it hurts bus boys, it hurts bartenders. People come into restaurants for the food, but they come back because of the service. So if you don't have happy waitstaff [because of] these dine-and-dash incidents, you make everyone unhappy and other customers are gonna feel it."

Toia is asking communities to come together to protect small businesses and local workers while looking to the government to provide protection for owners who may not have the same amount of financial resources as more prominent chains. 

"Larger chains may be able to absorb some losses, [but] small and independent restaurants often don't have the financial cushion to recover from the frequent theft," Toia told Fox News Digital. "A single bad month could put an independent restaurant out of business, shutting them down for good."

As a restaurant owner, Musterer insists he is used to experiencing the downfalls of running a business, but the most heartbreaking part was watching how the crimes impacted his employees. 

"Unfortunately, as a small business owner, you've got to take your punches," Musterer told Fox News Digital. "All these little things that happen are the cost of doing business, but when a server feels that, they're not used to ‘running their own small business' and having those challenges. So it definitely hurts them quite a bit."

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has ended funding to U.N. World Food Program emergency programs helping keep millions alive in Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen and 11 other impoverished countries, many of them struggling with conflict, according to the organization and officials who spoke to The Associated Press.

The World Food Program, the largest provider of food aid, appealed to the U.S. to roll back the new cuts in a social media post Monday. The unexpected round of contract cancellations has targeted some of the last remaining humanitarian programs run by the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to two U.S. officials, a United Nations official and documents obtained by the AP.

“This could amount to a death sentence for millions of people facing extreme hunger and starvation,” WFP said on X.

The agency said it was in contact with the Trump administration “to urge for continued support” for lifesaving programs and thanked the United States and other donors for past contributions.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other administration officials had pledged to spare emergency food programs and other life-and-death aid from deep cuts to U.S. foreign assistance. There was no immediate comment Monday from the State Department.

The projects were being canceled “for the convenience of the U.S. Government” at the direction of Jeremy Lewin, a top lieutenant at Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency who was appointed to oversee the elimination of USAID programs, according to termination notices sent to partners and viewed by the AP.

In Syria, a country battling poverty, hunger and insecurity after a 13-year civil war and an insurgency by the Islamic State group, some $230 million in contracts with WFP and humanitarian groups was terminated in recent days, according to a State Department document detailing the cuts that was obtained by the AP. 

The single biggest of the targeted Syria programs, at $111 million, provided bread and other daily food to 1.5 million people, the document says.

About 60 letters canceling contracts were sent over the past week. An official with the United Nations in the Middle East said all U.S. aid to WFP food programs across Yemen, another war-divided country that is facing one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters, has been stopped, apparently including food that already had arrived in distribution centers.

WFP also received termination letters for U.S.-funded programs in Lebanon and Jordan, where Syrian refugees would be hit hardest, the U.N. official said.

Some of the last remaining U.S. funding for key programs in Somalia, Afghanistan and the southern African nation of Zimbabwe also was affected, including for those providing food, water, medical care and shelter for people displaced by war, one of the U.S. officials said.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. 

Current and former USAID experts and partners said some $560 million in humanitarian aid was cut to Afghanistan, including for emergency food assistance, the treatment of severely malnourished babies, lifesaving medical care, safe drinking water, and emergency mental health treatment for survivors of sexual and physical violence. 

Another of the notices, sent Friday, abruptly pulled U.S. funding for a program with strong support in Congress that had sent young Afghan women overseas for schooling because of Taliban prohibitions on women's education, said an administrator for that project, which is run by Texas A&M University. 

The young women would now face return to Afghanistan, where their lives would be in danger, according to that administrator, who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The abrupt end of WFP programs threatens some of the world's most vulnerable populations, many of which depend on such food aid, according to humanitarian groups. The U.S. and other donors long have seen efforts to ease humanitarian crises as being in their strategic interest by stemming mass migration, conflicts and extremism, which struggles for resources can bring.

WFP chief Cindy McCain said in a posting on social media that the cuts “undermine global stability.”

Rubio had notified Congress and courts last month that USAID contract cuts were over, with about 1,000 programs spared worldwide and more than 5,000 others eliminated. That added to the shock of the new cuts. 

The Trump administration has accused USAID of wastefulness and advancing liberal causes. 

Trump's freeze on all foreign assistance through USAID and the State Department led to a brief shutdown of services at the al-Hol camp, where tens of thousands of alleged Islamic State fighters and their families are kept under guard.

That shutdown raised fears of an uprising or breakout at the camp. U.S. officials quickly intervened to restore services.

The State Department document obtained by the AP identifies two newly terminated contracts, run by Save the Children and the U.N. Population Fund, which provided mental health services and other care to women and children at al-Hol. It was not immediately clear if any other services were affected at the camp.

The U.S. had been the major funder of the WFP, providing $4.5 billion of the $9.8 billion in donations to the food agency last year.

SAN ANTONIO (AP) — All Kelvin Sampson could do was stand there, hands on hips with a blank look on his face, as the ball bounced loose and Houston's latest chance at a national title bounced away, too.

The coach who has commanded all details over a 36-year career of wins, losses and a few Final Fours couldn't do anything about this one. The last-second blunder ended in a 65-63 loss to Florida on Monday night.

It took years for the 69-year-old coaching lifer to turn Houston into one of college basketball's top programs again – one built on defense, toughness, rebounding and doing things a certain, hard-nosed way. Sampson rehabilitated his image too, the pariah who nobody understood becoming an almost-lovable  beacon for how to connect with players and do things the “right” way.

But there was no escape from the anguish this time, from squandering a 12-point second-half lead to that final-play turnover that sent Sampson into the offseason stuck on win No. 799 in a winding-road career.

“There's always going to be naysayers and Negative Nellies and all that stuff, but that's where your faith and your family is way more important than any of that stuff,” Sampson said outside Houston's locker room in the Alamodome.

“And protecting these kids, I care more protecting them right now to make sure they know what a great year they had. What an awesome, awesome, awesome year they had.”




The game ended with Houston (35-5) unable to even get up a shot on its last two possessions, a fact Sampson called “incomprehensible.” On the first, Emanuel Sharp drove the right side but had the ball stripped and lost it out of bounds with 26.6 seconds left and Houston down one.

Moments later, Houston had its second chance to go ahead. The ball again went to Sharp, who tried to fire a 3-pointer on the catch only to see a hard closeout by Florida star Walter Clayton Jr. coming his way.

Stuck in the air, he tried to dribble the ball to avoid a turnover and was forced to let it bounce, the ball hitting the court with about 4.5 seconds left and then continuing to bounce for another 2-plus precious seconds. Finally Florida's Alex Condon dove for the ball, sending Houston's Ja'Vier Francis to the floor and killing the final moments of the Cougars' title dream.

Moments later, as the confetti started to fall for the Gators, Sampson walked with his head down to the edge of the court as though trying to make sense of what had just happened. He descended the steps, then started making his way up the lane through the heaviest concentration of red-clad Houston fans in a painful march to the locker room.

“I wanted it so bad for him,” said Houston big man J'Wan Roberts, who played five seasons for Sampson after a redshirt year. “So, so, so bad. And it hurts.

“Coach Sampson, the role that he played in my life, I can't even put into words.”

It was nearly the highlight of a coaching career that includes stops at Washington State, Oklahoma — where he guided the Sooners to the 2002 Final Four — and Indiana. Ousted from IU due to an NCAA probe into Sampson making too many recruiting phone calls, he received a five-year show cause penalty in 2008 that kept him out of the college ranks until his return at Houston in 2014.

Sampson found refuge there after spending his exile in the NBA, while he offered the school the dream of reconnecting with its history tied to the famed Phi Slama Jama era in the 1980s — which before this year had marked the program's only two trips to the NCAA title game — behind a coach with a proven record for winning.

By his third season, Sampson had the Cougars back in March Madness. They won 33 games in his fourth, then two years later had the Cougars back in the Final Four in 2021 — the program's first since Hakeem Olajuwon and coach Guy Lewis led them to the 1984 title game before falling to Patrick Ewing and Georgetown.

The Indianapolis bubble run of four years ago eliminated any lingering doubt about Houston's full arrival as a national power. It's all rooted in Sampson's vision, built in his image by demanding an unyielding fight and work ethic going back to his upbringing in eastern North Carolina.

His team had put that on display all season, most recently with an improbable comeback in the final minute to stun Duke in Saturday's national semifinals. Then came Monday night's finale, leading just about the entire way and keeping Clayton under control after the Gators star had torn through March Madness.

The Cougars just couldn't finish it out on a night when they shot just 34.8%, including 6 of 25 from 3-point range, putting too much weight on the defense to carry them home.

“I'm just proud of the way we fought all season,” leading scorer L.J. Cryer said.

And in the end, Sampson couldn't find the answer. Instead, he spent 20 extra minutes after his postgame news conference talking it all out with reporters, an unusual sight for the losing coach on the final Monday night of the season.

“Disappointing,” he said. “But we didn't lose in the first round. We didn't lose in the CBI. We lost in the national championship game, to the best team the SEC has. We fought them tooth and nail down to the end, and I'm proud of my team.”

This story has been corrected to show Houston had twice made the NCAA title game, not once.

SAN ANTONIO (AP) — This ending was gritty and ugly, just the way Houston usually likes games. 

Except it was Florida forcing bad shots and turnovers against the Cougars to finish off the national championship game Monday night.

“The game plan was the most physical team is going to win,” Gators guard Alijah Martin said.

The Cougars had four turnovers in the final 1:21 of their 65-63 loss, the last one ending the game. 

“Just great down the stretch, how hard we played defensively,” Australian post Alex Condon said. “I think we got nine stops towards the end of the game. Yeah, it was just a team effort to get this win. It was crazy.”

Emanuel Sharp was unable to get off a 3-pointer with Walter Clayton Jr. running toward him and leaping with his left arm extended. Since the Houston guard was in the air himself, all he could do in was to let the ball fall to the floor — or get called for a travel when his feet came down.

With Sharp desperately screening Clayton in hopes that one of his teammates would be able to get the loose ball and get off a shot, Condon instead dived to the floor and reached out to get it with his hands while the clock was running out. 

“He had an unbelievable shot contest,” Cougars guard L.J. Cryer said of Clayton. “He definitely made a winning play.”

Houston trailed only 63 seconds all night, and yet fell short of its first national championship.

For Florida, it was a beautiful ugly. The Gators overcame a 12-point deficit after halftime for their third national championship, in their first title game since winning back-to-back in 2006 and 2007.

The Gators hadn't led since 8-6 until Alijah Martin hit two free throws with 46 seconds left to go up 64-63. That came right after Cryer was stripped underneath the Houston basket and Condon came away with the ball. 

Sharp also had a turnover when Will Richard had a steal with 26 seconds left that led to another free throw. Houston then called timeout with 19 seconds remaining to set up a final play.

Cryer got the ball to Sharp, who had no chance to complete his jumper with Clayton charging toward him. 

“We had a chance to win, just didn't get a shot off,” said Houston big man J'Wan Roberts, who part of 149 wins while playing in five seasons since getting to Houston six years ago. 

When the buzzer sounded, Sharp remained crouched on the court near that spot for an extended period. He was consoled by teammate Ja'Vier Francis — and Clayton, like Sharp from the Tampa Bay area. 

The Cougars had only nine turnovers in the entire game, but four came after Cryer's putback of his own miss with 2:29 left for a 62-60 lead.

“I'm just going through those last two possessions more than anything else. Incomprehensible in that situation we couldn't get a shot, couldn't get a shot,” Cougars coach Kelvin Sampson said. “But Florida was doing a good job running us off the line and forcing us to score it. We just didn't do a very good job of finishing some shots.”

MCALLEN, Texas (AP) — Migrants who were temporarily allowed to live in the United States by using a Biden-era online appointment app have been told to leave the country “immediately,” officials said Monday. It was unclear how many beneficiaries would be affected.

More than 900,000 people were allowed in the country using the CBP One app since January 2023. They were generally allowed to remain in the United States for two years with authorization to work under a presidential authority called parole.

“Canceling these paroles is a promise kept to the American people to secure our borders and protect national security,” the Department of Homeland Security media affairs unit said in response to questions.

Authorities confirmed termination notices were sent to CBP One beneficiaries but did not say how many. They were urged to voluntary self-deport using the same app they entered on, which has been renamed CBP Home.

“It's time for you to abandon the United States,” the Department of Homeland Security wrote to a Honduran family that entered the U.S. at the end of last year. The Associated Press reviewed the email received Sunday.

Others shared the same email on social media platforms. 

Al Otro Lado, a nonprofit organization that provides legal aid to migrants, said some who received the revocation letters are from Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico.

CBP One was a cornerstone of the Biden administration's strategy to create and expand legal pathways to enter the United States in an attempt to discourage illegal border crossings. By the end of December, 936,500 people had been allowed to enter with CBP One appointments at border crossings with Mexico. President Donald Trump ended CBP One for new entrants on his first day in office, stranding thousands in Mexico who had appointments into early February.




Trump has ended and revoked temporary status for many who benefited under Biden's policies. Homeland Security said Monday that Biden's use of parole authority — more than any president since it was created in 1952 — “further fueled the worst border crisis in U.S. history.”

Homeland Security said last month that it was revoking another form of parole for 532,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who flew to the country at their own expense with a financial sponsor. It ends April 24. 

The Trump administration has also announced an end to Temporary Protected Status for 600,000 Venezuelans and about 500,00 Haitians, though a federal judge temporarily put that on hold, including for about 350,000 Venezuelans who had been scheduled to lose TPS on Monday. TPS is granted in 18-month increments to people already in the U.S. whose countries are deemed unsafe for return due to natural disaster or civil strife.

            • Florida is the champion! The Florida Gators come from behind one more time in an NCAA tournament full of Gator come-from-behind wins, beating the Houston Cougars 65-63. 



            • One last stirring comeback: Houston hit its stride in the first half as their defense locked down Florida's high-flying offense. The Cougars built a big lead in the second half but the Gators charged back into the game to tie as the game got the eight-minute mark of the second half.
    


            • An instant classic: The game was extremely close through the final minutes after the Gators made their charge. Florida took the lead for the first time since the first half with 46.5 seconds to go.
    


            • The Gators hold on late: Houston could not get a shot off in the final seconds and the Gators got the big stop to win the school's third national championship in men's basketball.
    


            It's the most fitting way to end our live coverage of the NCAA men's basketball tournament.
    


            Here is “One Shining Moment.”
    

ONE SHINING MOMENT 🙌#MarchMadness pic.twitter.com/cjKbdhot3l


            The Florida Gators won the NCAA men's basketball championship on Monday, defeating the Houston Cougars in a heart-stopping contest that went all the way down to the final play.
    


            The Gators led for a grand total of 64 seconds in the game and trailed by as much as 12 with 16:24 to go in the second half. Houston's vaunted defense held Florida and their star guard Walter Clayton Jr. in check for much of the game.
    


            But, as they had so often in this tournament, the Gators came back. Slowly but surely throughout the second half, head coach Todd Golden and his team reeled in the Cougars. As the game got to crunchtime, Florida went on a 15-3 run to come all the way back and tie the game.
    


            It wouldn't be until the final minute that the Gators took the lead for the first time since the opening minutes of the contest. And, in a battle of Florida's high-flying offense against Houston's elite defense, it was the Gators making the key defensive plays in the final minutes to seal the championship.
    


            With 19 seconds left, Houston leisurely took the ball up the court, with Cougars head coach Kelvin Sampson content to hold the ball for the last shot of the game. Point guard Milos Uzan probed the perimeter but couldn't find and opening and passed to LJ Cryer at the top of the key. With Florida guard Will Richard draped all over him, Cryer dished the ball off to Emanuel Sharp with just five seconds left on the clock. Sharp went up for a deep 3-point attempt, but with Clayton flying at him, he pulled the shot down and put the ball on the floor.
    


            Sharp couldn't touch the ball again without a double-dribble being called and the ball bounced three agonizing times with no one else able to make it to the loose ball and get a shot off.
    


            Gators forward Alex Condon was the first to dive on the loose ball and the final horn sounded before either team could gain control, cementing Florida's third-ever national championship, and first since 2007.
    


            The Houston Cougars, behind their trademark defense and relentless offensive rebounding, led for nearly all of Monday night's championship game. They built a 12-point second-half lead at one point and looked to be heading toward the program's first-ever national title.
    


            But these Florida Gators have shown time and time again that they are never out of it, and they still had one more comeback left in them.
    


            Star guard Walter Clayton Jr. had zero points at halftime, but he scored 11 in the second half and came up with several clutch plays down the stretch. None was bigger than his defensive effort on Houston's final possession.
    


Check out the best photos from Monday night's thrilling game.
    


            Florida head coach Todd Golden could barely contain his excitement standing arm-in-arm with a trio of Gators seniors - Will Richard, Alijah Martin and Walter Clayton Jr. - as he spoke with CBS after his team's incredible comeback victory in the national championship game.
    


            “Like we've done all year, we made plays when we needed them the most,” Golden said. “We guarded our butts off down the stretch, made every 50/50 winning play.
    


            “The Gators are natty, baby! We got the natty, baby, we got the natty! Let's go!”
    


            Golden screamed in joy as his players swarmed around him on the Alamodome court.
    


            Will Richard explained what set this year's Gators squad apart from previous incarnations, which had suffered some disappointing March Madness exits.
    


            “Just how connected we are. We all love each other, we love playing for each other. And we love being a Gator!
    


            “Gator boys stay hot!” he exclaimed, recycling a catch phrase coined by Joakim Noah during Florida's back-to-back championship runs in 2006 and 2007.
    


            Florida guard Walter Clayton Jr. was named the most outstanding player of the tournament after the game.
    


            Clayton showed up when it mattered most for his team during the championship run, including scoring 30 or more points in both the Elite Eight win over Texas Tech and the Final Four showdown with Auburn. The only player to have done that before him – scoring 30 or more points in the Elite Eight and the Final Four – was Larry Bird for Indiana State in 1979.
    


            Walter Clayton Jr.'s night was one to forget for much of the game.
    


            But the Gators' star guard won't be remembered for his 3-10 shooting, 11 points or three turnovers in this one.
    


            Instead, the contest he made on Emanuel Sharp – the Houston Cougar who had foiled him for the previous 39 minutes and 55 seconds – on the last play of the game will be what is seared in the minds of Gator fans.
    

A DEFENSIVE STOP TO BECOME THE CHAMPIONS 🏆THE GATORS CAME UP HUGE WHEN IT MATTERED MOST 🙌#MarchMadness #NationalChampionship @GatorsMBK pic.twitter.com/T9cYmeRZd3


            When Sharp caught the ball at the top the key, Clayton was 15 feet or so away. He wasn't even at the free-throw line. Before Sharp could shoot, Clayton closed down and got a hand in his face, forcing Sharp to drop the ball because he didn't his shot to be blocked.
    


            After a night of frustration, it was a moment – THE moment – of redemption for the Gator star.
    


            Trailing by just two points, Houston had a number of options on how to approach the game's final 20 seconds.
    


            Go for a quick two? Hold the ball and look to drive to the basket late? Or go for a 3-pointer and the win?
    


            As Houston leisurely brought the ball up the court, it appeared that Cougars head coach Kelvin Sampson was content to hold the ball for the last shot of the game.
    


            Point guard Milos Uzan probed the perimeter, but couldn't find and opening and passed to LJ Cryer at the top of the key.
    


            With Gators guard Will Richard draped all over him, Cryer dished the ball off to Emanuel Sharp with just five seconds left on the clock.
    


            Sharp went up for a deep 3-point attempt, but with Walter Clayton Jr. flying at him, he pulled the shot down and put the ball on the floor.
    


            With Sharp unable to touch the ball again without a double-dribble being called, the ball bounced three agonizing times with no one else able to make it to the loose ball and get a shot off.

Final score: Florida 65, Houston 63



            The Houston Cougars couldn't get a shot off as the final seconds ticked off the clock and the Florida Gators are once again champions!
    

YOUR NATIONAL CHAMPIONS: THE FLORIDA GATORS 🏆🐊#MarchMadness @GatorsMBK pic.twitter.com/XatLv5x2hm


Final score: Florida 65, Houston 63



            After Florida had an adventure getting the ball across halfcourt, Denzel Aberbeen hit one of two free throws to give the Gators a skinny 2-point lead with less than 20 seconds left on the clock.
    


            Did Houston use up all its late game magic on Saturday? There's not long left to find out.
    


Score: Florida 65, Houston 63



            Florida's Will RIchard got a hand on the ball as Emanuel Sharp drove to the basket, and Sharp dribbled the ball off his leg. Florida has the ball back with a chance to extend its lead.
    


            The officials are reviewing the call now.
    


Score: Florida 64, Houston 63 



            Alijah Martin stepped to the line and hit a pair of free throws to give Florida its first lead since early in the game. Houston's Joseph Tugler fouled out on the play.
    


            The Gators have come all the way back! There's 46.5 seconds to go!
    


Score: Florida 64, Houston 63



            The Gators led for 17 seconds early in the game, but since then only the Cougars have held a lead.
    


            The Gators have tied the game several times, but can't quite find that breakthrough basket to take the lead.
    


            There's a big call coming up here – the Cougars couldn't get a shot to drop and Joseph Tugler for Houston grabbed a rebound. The ball flew out of bounds and the referees are determining if it will be Florida or Houston ball.
    


            There's just 1:21 to go.
    


Score: Houston 63, Florida 62



            After being silent most of the game, Florida's star Walter Clayton Jr. is showing his mettle in the final minutes.
    


            A pair of and-one plays and now a 3-pointer have Florida right in the thick of it. We're at 2:18 to go.
    


            It's the 11th tie of the game. What a battle!
    


Score: Houston 62, Florida 62



            With Florida having found their rhythm and battled back from a dozen points down, the final four minutes of this championship game are going to be a movie.
    


            All the jitters seem to be gone now, and both teams are playing on sheer instinct.
    


            Houston is fighting tooth and nail to keep Florida at bay, but the Gators are “chomping” at the bit, trailing by just a bucket.

            This is Kelvin Sampson's 51st March Madness game. He's earned trips to college basketball's most prestigious tournament as a fantastic head coach.
    


            But Houston's head man will admit that some of that success may come from the unproven and unseen traditions he keeps.
    


            You see, Sampson is a bit superstitious. So, he is wearing his lucky polo shirt tonight while roaming the Cougars sideline.
    


            The mojo is working so far.
    


            He told CNN's Coy Wire on Sunday that he and the team are 31-1 when he wears the nearly forgettable top.
    


            “I'm wearing out of that gray (polo). My wife's washed the shirt so many times – its collar just droops now. I don't look very good anyway, so I wear a droopy shirt really well,” he told Wire with a smile.
    


            Droopy is winning for now but Todd Golden and the Gators will have something to do with this outcome.

            On Monday, Houston has played a pretty perfect half of basketball and is leading the Gators at halftime.
    


            Will things repeat themselves?
    


            Florida head coach Todd Golden is known as a coach that relies on analytics to tweak and adjust his game plans and his adjustments at halftime against the Tigers got the Gators rolling, looking like the imperious team that they can be.
    


            The Cougars have a stronger defense than the Tigers and their head coach, Kelvin Sampson, is no slouch. The task for the second half remains the same as the first: Keep Walter Clayton Jr. from taking over the game.
    


            A task that's much easier said than done.
    


            The game is nearing the start of the second half.

            “I think I first saw coach at AAU basketball. I thought he talked with Kellen (Sampson) that he liked me, wanted me to be a Cougar,” Roberts said. “From that day he kind of kept me under his wing as much as possible until I committed.
    


                    “For these six years that I've known Coach Sampson, I can honestly say he's like a second father to me, especially on and off the court. He makes sure I'm good, randomly calls me, randomly texts me, tells me he loves me. When you come across people like that, you have to keep them with you for a long time. I feel like in the next five, 10 years, Coach Sampson is going to be a person I can call. Hopefully in the future when I have my kids, we can all sit down and have a great conversation about what we've been through.”

            Houston controlled the opening tipoff, and the national championship game is underway at the Final Four in San Antonio!
    


            West Region No. 1 and champion of the SEC Florida are seeking their third national title in program history and first since the Gators went back-to-back in 2006 and 2007.
    


            Florida took down SEC rival and top-overall seed Auburn in their semifinal game on Saturday and have looked nearly invincible during their current 11-game unbeaten streak, which has seen the Gators take down eight teams ranked in the top 25.
    


            The Midwest Region top seed and Big 12-winning Houston Cougars are in search of their first national champion after twice coming up one win short in 1983 and 1984. The Cougars are riding an 18-game winning streak and have only lost once since the start of December.
    


            Houston pulled off a miraculous comeback win against Duke in the semifinals, and just might be a team of destiny this year.
    


            Houston head coach Kelvin Sampson savored Saturday's incredible comeback win over Duke in the only way he knows how: Getting ready for Florida.
    


            A reporter asked Sampson to reflect on the scene when the Cougars arrived back at their San Antonio hotel after the win, when fans lined the street and cheered the team as they walked back into the hotel to get some rest.
    


            “My mind was focused on getting Kellen (Sampson, his son and assistant coach) by himself and getting to a laptop and looking at Florida. I'm not very good at that,” Sampson told reporters on Sunday.
    


            “My mother always used to tell me that I had to learn to smell the roses. My mother passed away in 2014. I never did learn.”
    


            CNN's Coy Wire got some time with Houston head coach Kelvin Sampson and Florida's Todd Golden ahead of Monday's showdown.
    


            Despite plenty of time between the Cougars' epic comeback, the sound inside the Alamodome doesn't appear to have dissipated from the cacophony of sound that erupted after the Houston upset win over Duke.
    


            Gator fans appeared to outnumber Houstonians around town today, but judging by the reception the Cougars got when they ran onto the court just now, Houston has louder (more?) fans by a slight margin. Just one person's audio take.
    


            This place is ready for a high energy bout.
    


            The Florida Gators have been on an incredible run of late, losing only one time since February 1.
    


            But that stellar run has not been without its tests. And head coach Todd Golden sees benefit in those close games earlier in the tournament ahead of the title game.
    


            “I think the UConn game was huge for us,” he said of the Gators' round of 32 opponent. “That was the first time in a while that we had been really tested, had our backs against the wall.
    


                    “To be honest, I think we came into this NCAA tournament with some pressure after winning the SEC tournament championship. We were playing free and loose for a long time leading up to that. Then that first weekend, we played great for the first 50 minutes against Norfolk, then tightened up a little bit. The UConn game, we felt so much pressure to win, as you need to in the tournament. We weren't playing as free as we had before.
                





            “Winning that game gave us a little bit of freedom and we relaxed. I would say the Tech game was similar. I thought we played great against Maryland. Tech was kicking our butts for a while, got us down 10 in the second half. Showed grit and resilience,” he added.
    


            “Once we got here, we kind of felt like we had the weight of the world off our shoulders. We made the Final Four, now it's time to go out and hoop, see what happens. That's definitely how I feel now going into tomorrow night.”
    


            One last college basketball game remains in the 2024-25 season and if Saturday's Final Four is any indication, it's going to be quite the ride.
    


            Florida and Houston will collide in San Antonio's Alamodome for the men's title after a national semifinal round that was simply magical. The Gators got to this point by surviving a heavyweight bout with fellow SEC team Auburn, outlasting the Tigers through the heroics of Walter Clayton Jr. The Cougars earned their way into this contest with one of the most unlikely comebacks in Final Four history that included trailing by six with 75 seconds to play.
    


            Both teams will have needed Sunday's day of rest. Houston's head coach Kelvin Sampson said Sunday that his players will have plenty left in the tank after their incredible rally against Duke.
    


            “Lives are so consumed by our next game, your next game. I'm glad last night was not our last game, that we do have a next game,” he said. “That's a good thing for this group because I've enjoyed coaching this team.”
    


            Florida head coach Todd Golden knows he has his work cut out for him by trying to come up with a game plan to counter Houston's tough defense.
    


            “Yeah, I mean, their defense worries me a lot, absolutely,” he said Sunday with a smile. “… They have incredible length and athleticism and physicality inside the paint. They wear you down, make it really hard on you.
    


            “Yeah, it definitely concerns me. I think we're going to have a couple different ideas, a couple different pitches, for lack of a better term, to throw at them late in the game. I think there's going to be some issues for us out there. If we don't kind of troubleshoot well, we'll be in trouble.”
    


            But Golden said he's going to put his team in position to do what they do best: Score points.
    


            “We're a pretty elite offensive team. We'll lean into that and allow our guys to go out there to make some plays and see what happens.”
    


            Off the court, Houston head coach Kelvin Sampson is heavily involved in trying to get federal recognition for the Lumbee Tribe, his Native American tribe in southeastern North Carolina.
    


            He told CNN's Coy Wire before the Final Four why that is so important to him:
    


            With about five-and-a-half minutes to go against Auburn, Florida's Alijah Martin broke loose on the fast break.
    


            He had Tahaad Pettiford, a guard for the Tigers, pestering him the whole way down the court. As he sprinted down the court, Auburn's Chad Baker-Mazara was waiting for him by the rim.
    


            Martin threw down a one-handed slam over both of them.

            It's a moment that is already living in Florida history as one of the program's greatest Final Four moments.
    


            “I just seen the replays. I'm getting tagged all across the blogs and stuff like this,” Martin said Sunday, “What was going through my mind was get two points, honestly, when I seen he was kind of late. I had a chance to purge, so I did it obviously.”
    


            His teammate Walter Clayton Jr said it was even better from the court.
    


            “I've been waiting for him to dunk on somebody all year. I was in the back of everything like, Oooh. It looked a lot better in real life, man, in real-time. I don't think video do it no justice,” Clayton said.
    


            Kellen Sampson is 69 years old while Todd Golden is 39. They're very different head coaches but they share one thing in common: They're both going after their first national title on Monday.
    


            Golden is known to be an analytics whiz who looks to the numbers to guide his game plans, while Sampson is much more old school.
    


            “We're very analytical in everything we do. We talk about that a lot. Whether it's roster building, whether it's scheduling, deciding who I want to play, game scouting reports, etc.,” Golden said.
    


            “It's more than any one specific thing, the way I like to explain it, a macro outlook on our decision-making and how we build out. We try to gather as much data as we possibly can when it comes to any sort of decision, then make what decision that data tells us to make. Then we got to live with the consequences. It's not always going to work. Life is not perfect. You want to give yourself the best chance to be successful and live with the results.”
    


            Sampson said he's definitely learned from coaches like Golden and Duke's Jon Scheyer, another young head coach who is already succeeding early in his career.
    


            “The game is in good hands with the young coaches. I think they're better set up to navigate these choppy waters that we have in front of us than maybe the old guys that coached the game when there was no shot clock, no three-point line. Then we had a 45-second shot clock. Most of these young ones don't even know that,” he said before the Final Four tipped off. “I know I learned from ‘em. There's a lot to be learned from these young guys, how they do things, their ideas, their energy. There's a lot of things I don't know. I've always been pretty good about not knowing what I don't know.”
    


            But that respect doesn't mean that Sampson isn't looking to score one for the sport's elders on Monday.
    


            “Last night, I got so many texts. I haven't returned any. There's too many to even look at. I didn't even get through all of them,” Sampson said on Sunday with a smile. “I saw Tubby (Smith) and Rick Barnes, Tom Izzo, (Gregg Popovich), a bunch of the older coaches. They all kind of had similar messages to me: win one for the old guys, something like that.”
    


            The Final Four was all about Clayton and Houston's LJ Cryer. Expect much more of the same on Monday.
    


            Clayton pulled off something only one other college player has done when he scored 34 against Auburn in the Final Four: back-to-back games racking up more than 30 points in the Elite Eight and Final Four. The only other player to pull off that feat was Larry Bird, the legendary Indiana State and Boston Celtics star.
    


            It was Clayton who took the biggest shots in crunchtime after the Gators overcame Auburn's strong first half. In fact, when the Tigers were getting out to a lead and dominating the opening stages of the game, it was Clayton who kept them in the contest by slashing to the basket repeatedly for layups and sinking 3-pointers.
    


            He shares that in common with Cryer, who was Houston's only bright spot on offense for much of Saturday night. The senior guard at one point had half of his team's points before the rest of the Cougars squad woke up and caught fire in the final minutes. He finished with 26 points and played all 40 minutes.
    


            “Our best player, the guy that kept us in the game, was LJ. He kept us in touch with them. So, when the time came, we had an opportunity to get the lead down where we could put some game pressure on ‘em, LJ was the guy,” Sampson said.
    


            Each player will be the focus of the opposing defense on Monday night, and Golden said Clayton's teammates are going to have to step up to get him the same kind of looks he enjoyed on Saturday.
    


            “I think Walter is going to be able to run around it a little bit, keep them on their toes in terms of whether he's going to get off it quick and let somebody else make the play or get in the paint,” he said.
    


            If styles make matchups, then we're in for an intense battle on Monday.
    


            Houston comes in sporting one of the nation's best defenses, which was a key factor in their win against Cooper Flagg and Duke on Saturday night.
    


            On the other end of things, Florida's explosive offense can barely be contained once it gets going and Gators guard Clayton is the straw that stirs the drink.
    


            “We're an elite offensive team, a top-10 defensive team. They're a top-10 offensive team and elite defensive team,” Florida head coach Todd Golden said. “I think it's going to be a contrasting battle that way. Hopefully, we can get the game up and down a little bit. They're going to impose their will as they've done on everybody this year. We're a pretty tough team also.”
    


            He added, “They're absolutely an elite team. The way they guard, they're going to make it really hard on us. I think they'll pressure the ball screen, try to get the ball out of Walt's hands. But they rotate, they're long, they play so hard, so tough. We're going to have great mental and physical toughness if we want to give ourselves a chance tomorrow night.”
    


            The Gators average a tick over 85 points per game and have been on an absolute tear this season. The Cougars only allow about 58 points per game and can ratchet up the pressure in the blink of an eye as the Blue Devils learned on Saturday – Duke made one free field goal in the final 10 minutes of its game against Houston.
    


            “They're the best defensive team in America. They have just a great identity as a program of just being both physically and mentally tough. That's something we've tried to pride ourselves on this year,” Golden said. “Houston I would say is a great example of that. Not only this year but Coach Sampson and his program have done it for a long time now.”
    


            It was a comeback that seemed so unlikely until it exploded into reality.
    


            With 8:17 to go in the game, Duke's Tyrese Proctor hit a free throw to put his team up by 14.
    


            Houston had scored one time in the previous five minutes and looked like they had nothing left.
    


            And then everything changed.
    


            Led by LJ Cryer, as they were throughout the whole game, the Cougars clawed their way back into it over the next eight minutes, eventually pulling off one of the most shocking, incredible and unlikely comebacks in Final Four history.
    


            Cryer hit a 3-pointer with 8:02 on the clock and then sunk a free throw minutes later after a Duke turnover to cut the deficit to 10. He missed his next free throw but Houston got the rebound and Cryer hit another jumper to bring the Cougars within eight.
    


            With 5:55 to go, J'Wan Roberts hit a layup to cut the deficit to six and the red parts of the crowd at the Alamodome were suddenly stirring. A second-chance tip in a minute later made the Cougars believe.
    


            Proctor hit two more free throws to rebuild the lead and then Cooper Flagg, the all-everything freshman for the Blue Devils, hit a 3-pointer with three minutes to go. The Duke lead was now nine and it looked like that was going to be enough to snuff out the Houston comeback attempt.
    


            Then Emmanuel Sharp entered the chat.
    


            A layup and two free throws from Sharp cut the lead back down to five with 1:27 to go. Flagg answered with two free throws of his own and the lead was seven with 1:26 to play. Sharp hit two more free throws with 1:14 left to cut the deficit to five again.
    


            Suddenly, all hell broke loose.
    


            First, Houston's Joseph Tugler touched the ball while Duke was trying to inbound it, getting a technical foul. Kon Knueppel made the free throw and Duke got the ball back with a chance to seal it. But Tugler wasn't going to go out on a mistake like that – he blocked a Knueppel layup attempt and the ball went back down the court, where Sharp hit another 3-pointer to make it 67-64 with 33 seconds to go.
    


            Duke got the ball inbounds after some trouble and Sion James made a bad mistake at a bad time, throwing an errant pass that was nabbed by Mylik Wilson. Wilson ran down the floor and shot a 3 to tie, but it missed – but there was Tugler again to jam home the rebound and cut the deficit to one.
    


            Houston fouled Proctor on the inbounds play for a one-and-one free throw opportunity. He bricked it and J'Wan Roberts grabbed the rebound. Flagg fouled him quickly with an over-the-back call that has been dissected afterward and, improbably, Houston was shooting free throws to take the lead with 19 seconds left.
    


            Roberts nailed them both and Houston had a one-point lead. Duke had one more chance and they went to their superstar, but Flagg couldn't make the jumper.
    


            Wilson grabbed the rebound and got the ball back to Cryer, who was fouled and sunk two more from the charity stripe. One last heave from Proctor went way wide of the basket and the Alamodome hit an ear-damaging decibel level as the Houston fans went absolutely insane.
    


            Florida outlasted Auburn in a heavyweight bout between the two best teams in the SEC on Saturday, using a second-half charge to take home a 79-73 victory.
    


            Led by Walter Clayton Jr.'s heroics – the star guard scored 34 points – the Gators came out on fire after the halftime break and overpowered a tough Tigers team.
    


            “He's incredible. On and off the court he's a great dude. We trust him in those situations. He knocks down big shots day after day,” said Thomas Haugh, Clayton's teammate.
    


            Auburn head coach Bruce Pearl said before the game that if the Gators could be more physical than Auburn, and if Clayton was the best guard on the floor, then Florida would beat his Tigers for the second time this year.
    


            That's exactly what happened in the second half.
    


            Tough interior defense from Florida held Johni Broome, the SEC player of the year, to three points on 1-4 shooting in the second half. Auburn shot over 50% in the first half and just 33% in the second. After having a huge advantage on points in the paint in the first half, the Tigers only had eight points down low in the second.
    


            Florida head coach Todd Golden used to be one of Pearl's assistants at Auburn and has a long history with the venerable head coach of the Tigers. It's safe to say that on this night, the student outfoxed the teacher with his halftime adjustments.
    


            “The way our game plan, we weren't executing it very well and it wasn't working very well. … The main message at halftime was we have to get back to doing what we do and executing in a positive way,” Golden said after the game.
    


            “We did a great job of guarding Johni one-on-one in the second half. I think he was 1-4 from the field. We started getting out in transition a little bit, saw the ball go through the basket, started gaining some confidence. We obviously played a really, really good second half.”
    


            It's a tough pill to swallow for Pearl and the Auburn Tigers, who were the top overall seed in this year's tournament and were looking to win the school's first-ever basketball national title.
    


            “I'm really proud of my team, how these guys made history, the best basketball team in the history of Auburn basketball. They gave us a ride that won't ever be forgotten. They did so many great things both on and off the court that I'm extremely proud of,” Pearl said after the game.
    


            “Played beautiful basketball in the first half. We were prepared. We had a great game plan. They executed it really well. We only turned the ball over twice. Second half, Florida's effort and energy, the fact that we're not as deep as what we normally are, was a factor. I thought fatigue was a factor. As a result, we weren't able to maintain control of the game, which I think if we had taken care of the basketball a little bit, not turned it over, not given them easy ones, we could have been in position to win the basketball game.”
    


            The Houston Cougars are back in the national championship game for the first time since 1984, following a stunning 70-67 come-from-behind victory over Duke.
    


            The Cougars, who are in the title game for the third time, are looking to win their first national championship in program history.
    


            Big 12 All-First Team selection LJ Cryer put the team on his back in the contest, scoring 26 points with five rebounds, while Emanuel Sharp added 16 points.
    


            Duke led by 14 points with over 8:17 minutes left to play, held a six-point lead with 1:14 to play, and trailed as the clock hit zero. Houston's suffocating defense showed up when the team needed it most, forcing Duke into a nearly eight-minute stretch without a field goal.
    


            “It's hard to process still. I thought our guys did an incredible job the whole game and I thought we had some good looks. Didn't finish,” Duke head coach Jon Scheyer told the CBS broadcast after the game.
    


            “You got to give Houston a ton credit. And still even with that, we have the lead with under a minute to go and - I couldn't be more proud - I'm not about to hang our head. I mean this part of it. You got to handle the wins, and you got to handle the losses too. In a moment like this, we we're this close. We felt like we were the best team, tonight was Houston. And hats off to them.”
    


            Scheyer continued: “I feel for them because they're competitive and they're going to think about plays. I didn't help them enough and that's where my mind goes. I couldn't be more proud of them. This is part of it. This is part of it unfortunately. … They played their hearts out. Just really feel for our guys.”
    


            Duke's freshman duo of Cooper Flagg and Kon Knueppel played valiantly all game, combining to score 43 of the Blue Devils' 67 points.
    


            The UConn Huskies pulled away in the second half and didn't look back, defeating the defending champions South Carolina 82-59 for a dominant victory in the women's NCAA tournament national championship game.
    


            With the victory, the Huskies secured a record 12th national title and improved to 12-1 all-time in NCAA tournament finals.
    


            In a rematch of the 2022 national championship game between two of women's college basketball's premier programs, both teams got off to frenetic starts on offense, with South Carolina making five of their first seven field goal attempts.
    


            The Gamecocks were in front early, but a flurry of UConn points in the paint from freshman forward Sarah Strong and senior guard Azzi Fudd sparked a 7-0 run for the Huskies to capture the early lead.
    


            Fudd continued to torch the Gamecocks finishing with 13 points at the break, as the Huskies walked off the court with a 10-point advantage. South Carolina struggled to match UConn's offensive firepower, shooting a season-worst 31.3% from the field in the first half.
    


            UConn came out of halftime stringing together a 6-2 run and doubled their lead by the third quarter's end, in part due to Fudd's 11 points. The Huskies cruised in the fourth quarter, stretching their lead to as much as 32 points with the crowd at Amalie Arena standing as UConn inched closer to victory.

            The Supreme Court on Monday allowed President Donald Trump to enforce the Alien Enemies Act for now, handing the White House a significant victory that will let immigration officials rely on a sweeping wartime authority to rapidly deport alleged gang members.
    


            The unsigned decision in the case, one of the most closely watched emergency appeals pending at the Supreme Court, lets Trump invoke the 1798 law to speed removals while litigation over the act's use plays out in lower courts. The court stressed that going forward, people who are deported should receive notice they are subject to the act and an opportunity to have their removal reviewed by the federal court where they are being detained.
    


            The court's three liberal justices dissented from the decision, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a member of the court's conservative wing, partially dissented.
    


            Trump praised the decision in a Truth Social post, writing in all-caps that it was “a great day for justice in America.”
    


            ”The Supreme Court has upheld the Rule of Law in our Nation by allowing a President, whoever that may be, to be able to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself,” he wrote.

Mistaken deportations stoke concerns over Trump's aggressive immigration push



            Trump administration officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, quickly applauded the decision, with Bondi describing it as a “landmark victory for the rule of law.”
    


            “An activist judge in Washington, DC does not have the jurisdiction to seize control of President Trump's authority to conduct foreign policy and keep the American people safe,” the attorney general posted on social media.
    


            “President Trump was proven RIGHT once again!” Noem posted, adding, “LEAVE NOW or we will arrest you, lock you up and deport you.”
    


            Trump framed his emergency appeal as a fight over judicial power and, specifically, US District Judge James Boasberg's order that temporarily blocked the president from enforcing the Alien Enemies Act against five Venezuelans who sued and a broader class of people who might be affected — in other words, anyone else. By granting the president's request, the Supreme Court has tossed out Boasberg's orders.
    


            Critically, the court made clear in its unsigned order that officials must give migrants subject to Trump's proclamation adequate notice that they are being removed pursuant to the wartime authority so they have “reasonable time” to bring habeas complaints. Those are suits brought by people who claim they are being detained by the government unlawfully.
    


            A key concern among attorneys representing the migrants has been that the government's rush to remove migrants under the act leaves them with little to no time to file such legal claims.
    


            Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court's most senior liberal, argued the Trump administration's conduct in the case “poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law.”
    


            “That a majority of this court now rewards the government for its behavior with discretionary equitable relief is indefensible,” she wrote. “We, as a nation and a court of law, should be better than this.” Barrett, though she did not write separately, joined a key portion of Sotomayor's dissent questioning whether habeas claims should be the exclusive way for people to challenge their deportations under the act.
    


            The court's order comes a day before Boasberg was set to hear arguments over whether to indefinitely block Trump's use of the wartime authority for the deportations. The judge is separately weighing whether “probable cause” exists to hold Trump administration officials in contempt for violating his orders when it allowed deportation flights to continue last month. Trump and other administration officials have repeatedly attacked Boasberg as exceeding his authority, earning the president a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.

            In her searing dissent, Sotomayor said the compliance issue before Boasberg “should be reason enough to doubt that the government appears before this court with clean hands.”
    


            “That is all the more true because the government has persistently stonewalled the District Court's efforts to find out whether the government in fact flouted its express order,” she wrote, later adding that the administration's “conduct in this litigation poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law.”
    


            In a separate dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson blasted the majority for ruling on the case using the emergency docket, without oral arguments or a more considered briefing. Jackson referenced the 1944 Korematsu case, in which the Supreme Court infamously allowed for the internment of hundreds of thousands of Japanese Americans during World War II.
    


            “I lament that the court appears to have embarked on a new era of procedural variability, and that it has done so in such a casual, inequitable, and, in my view, inappropriate manner,” Jackson wrote.
    


            “At least when the Court went off base in the past, it left a record so posterity could see how it went wrong,” she wrote.
    


            At issue was Trump's invocation on March 15 of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which gives a president broad power to target and remove undocumented immigrants in times of war or when an enemy attempts an “invasion or predatory incursion.” Trump has argued the flow of alleged gang members from Venezuela constitutes an invasion.
    


            Soon after Trump invoked the law, officials loaded up three planes with more than 200 Venezuelan nationals and flew them to El Salvador, where they are being housed in a maximum-security mega prison. The administration has since said that some of those people were deported under authorities other than the 18th century act.
    


            The Trump administration has said the men were affiliated with the Venezuelan gang  Tren de Aragua.

Supreme Court pauses midnight deadline to return man mistakenly deported to El Salvador



            But there have been growing questions about how those determinations were made. The court was considering the appeal amid revelations the administration mistakenly deported a Maryland father to El Salvador “because of an administrative error.” The deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia took place under a different legal authority — not the Alien Enemies Act — but it underscored the potential risks involved with the rapid deportations.
    


            Earlier Monday, the Supreme Court placed on hold a lower court order requiring the government to return Abrego Garcia to the US by midnight.
    


            Boasberg's order halting additional removals didn't block the administration from deporting alleged gang members under other laws, nor did it stop the administration from apprehending immigrants under the act. Trump nevertheless quickly appealed.
    


            The DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 on March 26 that Boasberg's orders could stand while the legal challenge plays out. The majority included one judge nominated by President George H.W. Bush and another by President Barack Obama.
    


            US Circuit Judge Karen Henderson wrote that the term “invasion” was widely understood among the nation's founders as involving a military invasion.
    


            “The phrase echoes throughout the Constitution ratified by the people just nine years before. And in every instance, it is used in a military sense,” she wrote.

This is CNBC's live coverage of how the White House, U.S. trade partners and employers are responding to President Donald Trump's historic tariffs.

What you need to know

CNBC's reporters are covering the tariffs and their effects, live on air and online from our bureaus in Washington; London; Singapore; San Francisco; and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.

Trump says the U.S. is "doing very well" in early negotiations with other countries who are set to soon face steep tariffs on their imports.

"I call them tailored deals, not off the rack," Trump said at an executive order signing event at the White House.

"These are tailored, highly tailored deals," he said.

Trump said representatives from Japan and South Korea will be flying to the U.S. "to make a deal."

At that rate, none of the 86 countries set to face new, so-called reciprocal tariffs will be able to head off the new duties before they take effect at 12:01 a.m. ET Wednesday.

— Kevin Breuninger

Canada reconfirmed plans to implement 25% retaliatory tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles into Canada, saying the new levies will go into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET Wednesday.

The response includes 25% tariffs on vehicles from the U.S. that are not compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, as well as non-Canadian and non-Mexican content of USMCA-compliant fully assembled vehicles imported into Canada from the U.S.

The latter part means that even if a vehicle made by General Motors, Ford Motor or Stellantis in the U.S. is compliant with USMCA, the parts that aren't from Canada and Mexico will be taxed.

The traditional "Detroit automakers" are among the top-selling car companies in Canada, but the country's overall market is far smaller than the U.S., at roughly 2 million light-duty vehicles in Canada compared  with 16 million or so in the U.S.

Canadian officials said "a remission framework for auto producers that incentivizes production and investment in Canada, and helps maintain jobs in the country, will also be implemented."

Canada's retaliatory tariffs also do not include auto parts, which Trump expects to implement on non-U.S. components by May 3.

 — Michael Wayland

Needham analyst Laura Martin cast doubt on Trump's belief that Apple can move its iPhone manufacturing to the U.S.

"I don't think that's a thing," Martin said on CNBC's "The Exchange."

Martin was responding to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt's suggestion that the company could move its production of the smartphone stateside. One analyst predicted that an iPhone would cost $3,500 if produced in the U.S.

— Alex Harring

Mortgage rates hit their highest level in more than a month amid continued uncertainty over the tariffs.

The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate climbed 25 basis points over two days to 6.85%, according to Mortgage News Daily.

The rates are now close to levels seen over the past six weeks, eliminating last week's declines for would-be homebuyers.

— Diana Olick and Erin Doherty

About 70 countries have reached out to the White House with "inquiries" about the tariffs, and they're "starting the negotiations right now," House Majority Whip Rep. Tom Emmer tells reporters after a meeting with Bessent.

"The president would have liked to hold off longer, but they've had so many responses from not only our allies ... but even our adversaries, about trade that they're starting the negotiations right now," Emmer, R-Minn.,says, according to Punchbowl News.

— Erin Doherty

U.S. Customs and Border Protection says it is prepared to begin enforcing Trump's so-called reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries' imports once the new duties kick in after midnight Wednesday.

CBP will be collecting "an individualized reciprocal higher tariff from 11% to 50% for 86 countries with exclusions on April 9, 2025, at 12:01 a.m. EDT," the agency said in a statement.

CBP also boasted that it has already collected more than $4.8 billion in tariffs on Chinese imports, more than $2 billion on Mexican imports and about $861 million on Canadian imports in response to Trump's prior executive orders.

— Kevin Breuninger

Mortgage rates hit their highest level in more than a month amid continued uncertainty over the tariffs.

The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate climbed 25 basis points over two days to 6.85%, according to Mortgage News Daily.

The rates are now close to levels seen over the past six weeks, eliminating last week's declines for would-be homebuyers.

— Diana Olick and Erin Doherty

Trump believes that Apple can make iPhones in the United States, the White House said today, as the administration pushes Apple to move device production to U.S. shores in response to Trump's tariffs.

"Absolutely, he believes we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it," Leavitt said when asked if Trump envisions U.S. workers doing device production like screwing parts into iPhones.

"As you know, Apple has invested $500 billion in the United States, so if Apple didn't think the the United States could do it, it wouldn't have put up that big chunk of change," she said.

Apple declined to comment on Leavitt's statement.

Apple does the majority of its manufacturing in China — which will receive a 104% tariff on Wednesday — and has secondary production in Vietnam, India, and other countries which are also in line to receive new import duties.

Analysts believe that made-in-USA iPhones would be too expensive to be commercially competitive.

Stock indexes gave up much of their early gains, as a market rebound appeared to lose steam in midday trading.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which roared nearly 4% higher when markets opened, was up about 0.7% at 2 p.m. ET.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq dipped into negative territory in the early afternoon, erasing all gains from their own relief rallies.

The volatile session followed a multi-day stock plunge spurred by Trump's announcement of sweeping new tariffs on nearly every country on earth.

— Kevin Breuninger

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt minimized an increasingly hostile public feud between Elon Musk and trade advisor Peter Navarro.

"Look, these are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and on tariffs," Leavitt told reporters at a briefing when asked about the spat between the Trump administration colleagues.

"Boys will be boys, and we will let their public sparring continue," she said.

— Kevin Breuninger

The U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports will shoot up to 104% at 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday, a White House official confirmed to CNBC.

Trump on Monday had threatened to raise existing tariffs on China by 50% on Wednesday unless Beijing dropped its retaliatory duties on U.S. goods by Tuesday.

That same day, Trump said he specified that China faced a deadline of "12 o'clock" to remove its tariffs.

Beijing vowed that it would not scrap its 34% retaliatory tariffs.

— Kevin Breuninger

Republican Sen. Thom Tillis told Greer he is "skeptical" that Trump's tariff strategy will work and not alienate voters.

The North Carolina lawmaker pressed Greer at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on who would be held responsible if the strategy fails.

"Whose throat do I get to choke if this proves to be wrong?" Tillis asked Greer.

"I'm just trying to figure out if they're going to feel good about this," Tillis said.

"I wish you well, but I am skeptical," Tillis said.

— Erin Doherty

Elon Musk, the de facto head of government job-slashing team DOGE and a top advisor to Trump, personally appealed to the president to reverse his tariff plan over the weekend, The Washington Post reported.

"The attempted intervention, confirmed by two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks, has not brought success so far," the Post said.

The report came as Musk continued a days-old feud with Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro, who is an ardent supporter of the tariffs.

"Navarro is truly a moron. What he says here is demonstrably false," Musk wrote on X, his social media site.

The report carried the bylines of four reporters, all of whom cover technology. One of the reporters, Faiz Siddiqui, covers X and Tesla, whose CEO is Musk.

— Dan Mangan

A quartet of congressmen are introducing a bipartisan bill that would rein in Trump's tariff powers by giving Congress a final say over whether his duties can remain in effect.

The House legislation, dubbed The Trade Review Act of 2025, requires Trump to give Congress 48 hours' notice before imposing or increasing tariffs, along with an explanation and an impact assessment.

The duties will last only 60 days unless Congress passes a joint resolution to extend them, the bill says. The legislature also allows Congress to end a tariff early via joint resolution.

The bill was introduced by Reps. Don Bacon, R-Neb., Jeff Hurd, R-Colo., Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., and Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y.

It mirrors a Senate bill previously introduced by Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.

The Trump administration has said that the president will veto the bill if it reaches his desk.

— Kevin Breuninger

Sen. Ron Wyden, Ore., said Trump's tariffs have turned the U.S. economy "from the envy of the world to a laughingstock in less time than it took to finish March Madness."

The top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee said he doesn't "see any strategy" behind Trump's tariffs.

It's "classic Donald Trump," Wyden said during a hearing with Greer.

— Erin Doherty

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer cited the ongoing feud between Navarro and Musk as he argued for the president to "immediately reverse his reckless trade war."

"The chaos within the Trump administration was shown a few minutes ago when Elon Musk called Peter Navarro, the chief architect of these tariffs, a moron," Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor.

"That's Musk's word. He called him a moron," Schumer said. "Their plan is so crazy, so controversial, that this administration cannot get its act together, with them calling names about each other, to — against one another, about this tariff plan."

"Donald Trump should immediately reverse his reckless trade war," said Schumer. "He should halt his tariff tax at once, and he should start focusing more on America's actual trade adversaries, like China, instead of picking a fight with the entire world and causing chaos and steering us towards a recession in the process."

— Dan Mangan

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said the Trump administration is "managing a massive number of requests for negotiations" from countries seeking to be spared from aggressive new U.S. tariffs.

"It is challenging to go through them," Hassett said in a Fox News interview.

"There are so many to go through that we're actually getting ready to present a plan for [Trump] on who and when" to speak with, Hassett said.

— Kevin Breuninger

Jimmy Donaldson, also known as MrBeast on the internet, says the chocolate bars he sells through his company, Feastables, will be cheaper to make under Trump's new tariffs.

"Ironically, because of all the new tariffs it is now way cheaper to make our chocolate bars we sell globally NOT in America because other countries don't have a 20%+ tariff on our cogs," Donaldson posted.

Donaldson is the most followed creator on YouTube, with more than 380 million subscribers.

He founded the chocolate company in 2022 and has built it into a global brand. Chocolate from the company is produced in Peru and the United States and is sold in 20 countries.

--Zach Vallese

Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung said his nation is prepared to negotiate with the U.S. on tariffs and other trade issues.

"Regarding the negotiation content, whether it is reducing tariffs or investment procurement, especially the non-tariff trade barriers that the U.S. is concerned about, we have prepared various plans," Chia-lung told reporters.

"As long as the negotiation time and method are confirmed, we can negotiate with the United States at any time," he said.

A growing part of Walmart's business could make it more resilient against tariffs and a possible recession.

Walmart's membership program Walmart+ is growing — and the company says it is driving loyalty among customers. Subscribers accounted for nearly half of all spending on Walmart's website and app in its most recent fiscal year, the company told CNBC. 

That gives Walmart a few advantages if Trump's tariffs raise its input costs or trigger an economic downturn. As the memberships are highly profitable, they give Walmart room to keep prices of groceries and other staples low even if the company's expenses increase.

Walmart+ is gaining ground at a good time for Walmart. The retailer gave a financial outlook that disappointed Wall Street in February — even before Trump announced the steep duties on key U.S. trade partners.

— Jacob Pramuk and Melissa Repko

Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky tore into the zero-sum view of trade that Trump has repeatedly espoused in defense of his sweeping tariff plans.

"It's based on a fallacy" that "somehow, in a trade, someone must lose," Paul said on CNBC's "Squawk Box."

The idea that "someone's taking advantage of you, and China is ripping you off or Japan is ripping you off — it's absolutely a fallacy," he said.

"Every trade that occurs in the marketplace is mutually beneficial," said the like-minded son of the staunchly libertarian former congressman Ron Paul. "If you have a free society and I want to trade with you, if you want to sell me your coat and I give you $200 for it, we both agree to it and we're both happy."

"The trade is always a win-win," he said.

— Kevin Breuninger

California Rep. Ro Khanna says Trump's tariffs have been hitting his district in Silicon Valley hard, especially with delayed IPOs and mergers.

"I'm hearing that these are some of the most self-destructive, wealth-destroying policies that any modern president has had," Khanna said on CNBC's "Squawk Box."

The Democrat said the tariffs have hurt not just the tech companies, but also the manufacturers.

Khanna also singled out Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, calling Lutnick's claim that tariffs would lead to more iPhone production false.

"I know Lutnick loves 19th-century policies, but he should understand 21st-century production," Khanna said.

Khanna's suggestion for Trump? "Bring in new people on an economic team, assure the country you're never going to do blanket tariffs again, that was a mistake, and that you're going to look at things sector by sector."

Businesses and consumers want certainty as Trump's steep tariffs loom, says Levi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass.

"The number one thing that everybody's wrestling with right now, ourselves, the industry and most importantly, the consumer, everybody is wrestling with the uncertainty that's out there. We need some clarity," she said on CNBC's "Mad Money."

The denim retailer reported first-quarter results earlier today, and maintained its earnings and sales outlook for the year. Levi's did not include the effects of the new duties in its guidance.

Any price hikes the company makes to offset the tariffs would be "surgical," she said on the company's earnings call.

Levi's manufactures some of its products in countries like Cambodia and Vietnam, which will face 49% and 46% tariffs, respectively, under Trump's plan.

— Jacob Pramuk

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is sharply escalating his attacks on top Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro as he defends his car company and chafes against the administration's tariff plans.

"Tesla has the most American-made cars. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks," Musk, Trump's top campaign donor, wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.

"Navarro is truly a moron. What he says here is demonstrably false," Musk wrote in another post.

Musk was responding to Navarro's contention in a CNBC interview on Monday that Musk is not a car manufacturer but a car "assembler" whose vehicles are made of many parts sourced from overseas.

Days earlier, Musk in a since-deleted X post said Navarro "ain't built s---." In a separate post, Musk questioned Navarro's credentials, writing, "A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing."

Musk currently works for Trump as head of the White House DOGE initiative. As Trump commits to his staunchly protectionist agenda, Musk has recently signaled his support for free-trade policies.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shrugged off questions about Musk's attacks on his colleague.

"Whatever," Leavitt told CNBC's Eamon Javers. "We are the most transparent administration in history expressing our disagreements in public."

Cambodia is being hit with the biggest single nation tariff rate of all, at 49%.

This has major implications for its factories, now in a fight to survive the next few months if the tariffs are implemented, as retail partners freeze orders. 

Its one million workers, many of whom are women at the low-end of the global income distribution pie, are facing financial ruin. 

But a U.S. trade group that represents retailers reliant on Cambodia says factories now based in Cambodia will "absolutely not" be coming back to the U.S. 

Instead, they will seek out alternative manufacturing locations in lower tariff regimes.

Trump says China "wants to make a deal" as his deadline for steep new tariffs draws near, but adds that Beijing has not yet reached out to the United States.

"They don't know how to get it started. We are waiting for their call. It will happen!" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Trump also held what he described as a "great call" with South Korea's acting president, Han Duck-soo. 

"We have the confines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries."

— Kevin Breuninger

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says China is playing with a "losing hand" in the escalating tariff back-and-forth between the two countries.

"I think it was a big mistake, this Chinese escalation, because they're playing with a pair of twos," Bessent said on "Squawk Box." 

Other countries appear to be more willing to negotiate than China, he said.

"If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals," he said, "and part of the calculus of that may be that some part of the tariffs stay on."

Last night, members of the administration discussed which countries to prioritize for trade talks, he added.

— Jesse Pound

Founder and CEO of Citadel Ken Griffin is taking aim at Trump's tariffs, calling them a a "huge policy mistake" that will hurt middle-class Americans. 

"I am really afraid of us abdicating our role of leadership for the free world," Griffin said at an event for the 100th anniversary of the University of Miami, per Bloomberg.

"That's the path we're on," the GOP donor adds. 

— Erin Doherty 

Stephane Boujnah, CEO of Euronext, says the recent market selloff is not a sign of panic, but simply a rotation of assets.

"Since this began, money is leaving the United States to be reinvested in Europe," Boujnah said in an interview with France Inter radio today. 

Investors, he said, are struggling to navigate Trump's unpredictability, which is making the U.S. "unrecognizable."

"We are mourning the United States that we knew … which was very similar in values and institutions to Europe," he said. "Now it looks more like an emerging country."

Euronext operates markets in various European cities, including Paris, Milan, Amsterdam, Brussels and Dublin.

Historical allies the U.S. and European Union should have zero tariffs between them, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen urged amid the bloc's ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of 20% White House duties it was slapped with last week.

"Engaging in a global trade war is the surest way to achieve a global recession," Valtonen she said during a press conference, in comments reported by Reuters. "But of course the European Union now has to react to what the U.S. has put forward,

The EU has previously expressed willingness to take steps against Washington if negotiations fail, but it has yet to specify the nature and extent of these potential countermeasures.

U.S. markets are poised to open higher this morning, after three days of steep losses. 

Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rebounded 747 points, or 2%. Futures tied to the S&P 500 were up 1.5%, while Nasdaq-100 futures gained about 1.3%.

Asian markets also closed higher Tuesday, staunching a decline fueled by Trump's tariff rollout that has seen the biggest losses since the pandemic.

— Sean Conlon

Von der Leyen and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held "constructive" talks today that touch on a possible mechanism for trade diversion in the wake of sweeping levies announced by the world's first economy.

"In response to the widespread disruption caused by the US tariffs, President von der Leyen stressed the responsibility of Europe and China, as two of world's largest markets, to support a strong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field," according to an EU readout, which added that von der Leyen called for a "negotiated resolution to the current situation" that avoids escalation.

"The leaders discussed setting up a mechanism for tracking possible trade diversion and ensuring any developments are duly addressed," the readout said.

Speculation has been mounting whether Trump's protectionist agenda will push U.S. trade partners toward China in a bid to redress commercial relations.

The conversation between the Beijing administration and the EU chief takes place after Washington last Wednesday slapped China and the EU with reciprocal tariffs of 34% and 20%, respectively. Beijing has already retaliated with its own 34% levies on the U.S., which is now threatening further countermeasures.

The newly confirmed U.S. Trade Representative, Jamieson Greer, will testify before the Senate Finance Committee today at a hearing on "The President's 2025 Trade Policy Agenda." 

Greer's testimony will offer the Senate one of its first opportunities to question a Trump administration official about the president's trade and tariff policy since Trump unveiled the sweeping new tariff regime. 

The hearing will begin at 10:00 a.m. ET, and CNBC.com will stream the hearing on our liveblog.

— Christina Wilkie

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez will visit China and Vietnam later this week, as Europe prepares to absorb the impacts of a new 20% tariff rate.

Sanchez is scheduled to visit Hanoi on Wednesday, the same day the new Trump tariff rates go into effect. Then he will go to Beijing, according to his office.

The visit underscores the pressure on EU bloc countries like Spain to reassess their trade relationships in the wake of Trump's tariffs.

This is CNBC's live coverage of how the White House, U.S. trade partners and employers are responding to President Donald Trump's historic tariffs.

What you need to know

CNBC's reporters are covering the tariffs and their effects, live on air and online from our bureaus in Washington; London; Singapore; San Francisco; and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt minimized an increasingly hostile public feud between Elon Musk and trade advisor Peter Navarro.

"Look, these are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and on tariffs," Leavitt told reporters at a briefing when asked about the spat between the Trump administration colleagues.

"Boys will be boys, and we will let their public sparring continue," she said.

— Kevin Breuninger

The U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports will shoot up to 104% at 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday, a White House official confirmed to CNBC.

Trump on Monday had threatened to raise existing tariffs on China by 50% on Wednesday unless Beijing dropped its retaliatory duties on U.S. goods by Tuesday.

That same day, Trump said he specified that China faced a deadline of "12 o'clock" to remove its tariffs.

Beijing vowed that it would not scrap its 34% retaliatory tariffs.

— Kevin Breuninger

Republican Sen. Thom Tillis told U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer he is "skeptical" that Trump's tariff strategy will work and not alienate voters.

The North Carolina lawmaker pressed Greer at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on who would be held responsible if the strategy fails.

"Whose throat do I get to choke if this proves to be wrong? Tillis asked Greer.

"I'm just trying to figure out if they're going to feel good about this," said Tillis.

"I wish you well, but I am skeptical."

— Erin Doherty

Elon Musk, the de facto head of DOGE and a top advisor to Trump, personally appealed to the president to reverse his tariff plan over the weekend, The Washington Post reported.

"The attempted intervention, confirmed by two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks, has not brought success so far," The Post noted.

The report came a Musk continued a days-old feuding with Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro, who is an ardent supporter of the tariffs.

"Navarro is truly a moron. What he says here is demonstrably false," Musk wrote on X, his social media site.

The report carried the bylines of four reporters, all of whom cover technology. One of the reporters, Faiz Siddiqui, covers X and Tesla, whose CEO is Musk.

— Dan Mangan

A quartet of congressmen are introducing a bipartisan bill that would rein in Trump's tariff powers by giving Congress a final say over whether his duties can remain in effect.

The House legislation, dubbed The Trade Review Act of 2025, requires Trump to give Congress 48 hours' notice before imposing or increasing tariffs, along with an explanation and an impact assessment.

The duties will only last 60 days, unless Congress passes a joint resolution to extend them, the bill states. The legislature also allows Congress to end a tariff early via joint resolution.

The bill was introduced by Reps. Don Bacon, R-Neb., Jeff Hurd, R-Colo., Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., and Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y.

It mirrors a Senate bill previously introduced by Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.

The Trump administration has said that the president will veto the bill if it reaches his desk.

— Kevin Breuninger

Sen. Ron Wyden, Ore., says Trump's tariffs have turned the U.S. economy "from the envy of the world to a laughingstock in less time than it took to finish March Madness."

The top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee said he doesn't "see any strategy" behind Trump's tariffs.

It's "classic Donald Trump," said Wyden during a hearing with Trump's trade representative, Jamieson Greer.

— Erin Doherty

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer cited the ongoing feud between Navarro and Musk as he argued for the president to "immediately reverse his reckless trade war."

"The chaos within the Trump administration was shown a few minutes ago when Elon Musk called Peter Navarro, the chief architect of these tariffs, a moron," Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor.

"That's Musk's word. He called him a moron," Schumer said, "Their plan is so crazy, so controversial, that this administration cannot get its act together with them, calling names about each other, to--against one one another, about this tariff plan."

"Donald Trump should immediately reverse his reckless trade war," said Schumer. "He should halt his tariff tax at once, and he should start focusing more on America's actual trade adversaries like China, instead of picking a fight with the entire world and causing chaos and steering us towards a recession in the process."

— Dan Mangan

National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett says that the Trump administration is "managing a massive number of requests for negotiations" from countries seeking to be spared from aggressive new U.S. tariffs.

"It is challenging to go through them," Hassett said in a Fox News interview.

"There are so many to go through that we're actually getting ready to present a plan for [Trump] on who and when" to speak with, Hassett said.

— Kevin Breuninger

Jimmy Donaldson, also known as MrBeast on the internet, says the chocolate bars he sells through his company, Feastables, will be cheaper to make under Trump's new tariffs.

"Ironically, because of all the new tariffs it is now way cheaper to make our chocolate bars we sell globally NOT in America because other countries don't have a 20%+ tariff on our cogs," Donaldson posted.

Donaldson is the most followed creator on YouTube, with more than 380 million subscribers.

He founded the chocolate company in 2022 and has built it into a global brand. Chocolate from the company is produced in Peru and the United States and is sold in 20 countries.

--Zach Vallese

Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung said his nation is prepared to negotiate with the U.S. on tariffs and other trade issues.

"Regarding the negotiation content, whether it is reducing tariffs or investment procurement, especially the non-tariff trade barriers that the U.S. is concerned about, we have prepared various plans," Chia-lung told reporters.

"As long as the negotiation time and method are confirmed, we can negotiate with the United States at any time," he said.

A growing part of Walmart's business could make it more resilient against tariffs and a possible recession.

Walmart's membership program Walmart+ is growing — and the company says it is driving loyalty among customers. Subscribers accounted for nearly half of all spending on Walmart's website and app in its most recent fiscal year, the company told CNBC. 

That gives Walmart a few advantages if Trump's tariffs raise its input costs or trigger an economic downturn. As the memberships are highly profitable, they give Walmart room to keep prices of groceries and other staples low even if the company's expenses increase.

Walmart+ is gaining ground at a good time for Walmart. The retailer gave a financial outlook that disappointed Wall Street in February — even before Trump announced the steep duties on key U.S. trade partners.

— Jacob Pramuk and Melissa Repko

Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky tore into the zero-sum view of trade that Trump has repeatedly espoused in defense of his sweeping tariff plans.

"It's based on a fallacy" that "somehow, in a trade, someone must lose," Paul said on CNBC's "Squawk Box."

The idea that "someone's taking advantage of you, and China is ripping you off or Japan is ripping you off — it's absolutely a fallacy," he said.

"Every trade that occurs in the marketplace is mutually beneficial," said the like-minded son of the staunchly libertarian former congressman Ron Paul. "If you have a free society and I want to trade with you, if you want to sell me your coat and I give you $200 for it, we both agree to it and we're both happy."

"The trade is always a win-win."

— Kevin Breuninger

California Rep. Ro Khanna says Trump's tariffs have been hitting his district in Silicon Valley hard, especially with delayed IPOs and mergers.

"I'm hearing that these are some of the most self-destructive, wealth-destroying policies that any modern president has had," Khanna said on CNBC's "Squawk Box."

The Democrat said the tariffs have hurt not just the tech companies, but also the manufacturers.

Khanna also singled out Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, calling Lutnick's claim that tariffs would lead to more iPhone production false.

"I know Lutnick loves 19th-century policies, but he should understand 21st-century production," Khanna said.

Khanna's suggestion for Trump? "Bring in new people on an economic team, assure the country you're never going to do blanket tariffs again, that was a mistake, and that you're going to look at things sector by sector."

Businesses and consumers want certainty as Trump's steep tariffs loom, says Levi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass.

"The number one thing that everybody's wrestling with right now, ourselves, the industry and most importantly, the consumer, everybody is wrestling with the uncertainty that's out there. We need some clarity," she said on CNBC's "Mad Money."

The denim retailer reported first-quarter results earlier today, and maintained its earnings and sales outlook for the year. Levi's did not include the effects of the new duties in its guidance.

Any price hikes the company makes to offset the tariffs would be "surgical," she said on the company's earnings call.

Levi's manufactures some of its products in countries like Cambodia and Vietnam, which will face 49% and 46% tariffs, respectively, under Trump's plan.

— Jacob Pramuk

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is sharply escalating his attacks on top Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro as he defends his car company and chafes against the administration's tariff plans.

"Tesla has the most American-made cars. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks," Musk, Trump's top campaign donor, wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.

"Navarro is truly a moron. What he says here is demonstrably false," Musk wrote in another post.

Musk was responding to Navarro's contention in a CNBC interview on Monday that Musk is not a car manufacturer but a car "assembler" whose vehicles are made of many parts sourced from overseas.

Days earlier, Musk in a since-deleted X post said Navarro "ain't built s---." In a separate post, Musk questioned Navarro's credentials, writing, "A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing."

Musk currently works for Trump as head of the White House DOGE initiative. As Trump commits to his staunchly protectionist agenda, Musk has recently signaled his support for free-trade policies.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shrugged off questions about Musk's attacks on his colleague.

"Whatever," Leavitt told CNBC's Eamon Javers. "We are the most transparent administration in history expressing our disagreements in public."

Cambodia is being hit with the biggest single nation tariff rate of all, at 49%.

This has major implications for its factories, now in a fight to survive the next few months if the tariffs are implemented, as retail partners freeze orders. 

Its one million workers, many of whom are women at the low-end of the global income distribution pie, are facing financial ruin. 

But a U.S. trade group that represents retailers reliant on Cambodia says factories now based in Cambodia will "absolutely not" be coming back to the U.S. 

Instead, they will seek out alternative manufacturing locations in lower tariff regimes.

Trump says China "wants to make a deal" as his deadline for steep new tariffs draws near, but adds that Beijing has not yet reached out to the United States.

"They don't know how to get it started. We are waiting for their call. It will happen!" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Trump also held what he described as a "great call" with South Korea's acting president, Han Duck-soo. 

"We have the confines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries."

— Kevin Breuninger

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says China is playing with a "losing hand" in the escalating tariff back-and-forth between the two countries.

"I think it was a big mistake, this Chinese escalation, because they're playing with a pair of twos," Bessent said on "Squawk Box." 

Other countries appear to be more willing to negotiate than China, he said.

"If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals," he said, "and part of the calculus of that may be that some part of the tariffs stay on."

Last night, members of the administration discussed which countries to prioritize for trade talks, he added.

— Jesse Pound

Founder and CEO of Citadel Ken Griffin is taking aim at Trump's tariffs, calling them a a "huge policy mistake" that will hurt middle-class Americans. 

"I am really afraid of us abdicating our role of leadership for the free world," Griffin said at an event for the 100th anniversary of the University of Miami, per Bloomberg.

"That's the path we're on," the GOP donor adds. 

— Erin Doherty 

Stephane Boujnah, CEO of Euronext, says the recent market selloff is not a sign of panic, but simply a rotation of assets.

"Since this began, money is leaving the United States to be reinvested in Europe," Boujnah said in an interview with France Inter radio today. 

Investors, he said, are struggling to navigate Trump's unpredictability, which is making the U.S. "unrecognizable."

"We are mourning the United States that we knew … which was very similar in values and institutions to Europe," he said. "Now it looks more like an emerging country."

Euronext operates markets in various European cities, including Paris, Milan, Amsterdam, Brussels and Dublin.

Historical allies the U.S. and European Union should have zero tariffs between them, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen urged amid the bloc's ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of 20% White House duties it was slapped with last week.

"Engaging in a global trade war is the surest way to achieve a global recession," Valtonen she said during a press conference, in comments reported by Reuters. "But of course the European Union now has to react to what the U.S. has put forward,

The EU has previously expressed willingness to take steps against Washington if negotiations fail, but it has yet to specify the nature and extent of these potential countermeasures.

U.S. markets are poised to open higher this morning, after three days of steep losses. 

Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rebounded 747 points, or 2%. Futures tied to the S&P 500 were up 1.5%, while Nasdaq-100 futures gained about 1.3%.

Asian markets also closed higher Tuesday, staunching a decline fueled by Trump's tariff rollout that has seen the biggest losses since the pandemic.

— Sean Conlon

Von der Leyen and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held "constructive" talks today that touch on a possible mechanism for trade diversion in the wake of sweeping levies announced by the world's first economy.

"In response to the widespread disruption caused by the US tariffs, President von der Leyen stressed the responsibility of Europe and China, as two of world's largest markets, to support a strong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field," according to an EU readout, which added that von der Leyen called for a "negotiated resolution to the current situation" that avoids escalation.

"The leaders discussed setting up a mechanism for tracking possible trade diversion and ensuring any developments are duly addressed," the readout said.

Speculation has been mounting whether Trump's protectionist agenda will push U.S. trade partners toward China in a bid to redress commercial relations.

The conversation between the Beijing administration and the EU chief takes place after Washington last Wednesday slapped China and the EU with reciprocal tariffs of 34% and 20%, respectively. Beijing has already retaliated with its own 34% levies on the U.S., which is now threatening further countermeasures.

The newly confirmed U.S. Trade Representative, Jamieson Greer, will testify before the Senate Finance Committee today at a hearing on "The President's 2025 Trade Policy Agenda." 

Greer's testimony will offer the Senate one of its first opportunities to question a Trump administration official about the president's trade and tariff policy since Trump unveiled the sweeping new tariff regime. 

The hearing will begin at 10:00 a.m. ET, and CNBC.com will stream the hearing on our liveblog.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez will visit China and Vietnam later this week, as Europe prepares to absorb the impacts of a new 20% tariff rate.

Sanchez is scheduled to visit Hanoi on Wednesday, the same day the new Trump tariff rates go into effect. Then he will go to Beijing, according to his office.

The visit underscores the pressure on EU bloc countries like Spain to reassess their trade relationships in the wake of Trump's tariffs.

Mortgage rates hit their highest level in over a month this week, reversing course after a period of improvement.

The average rate on the 30-year fixed rate jumped 22 basis points Monday and another 3 basis points Tuesday to 6.85%, according to Mortgage News Daily, fully erasing the decline from last week.

Much like the stock market, the bond market has been on a roller coaster over the last week, and mortgage rates are along for the ride.

Last week the 30-year fixed rate dropped to the lowest level since last October after President Donald Trump announced global tariffs. The announcement sent the stock market plunging and investors rushing to the relative safety of the bond market. As a result, bond yields fell. Mortgage rates follow loosely the yield on the 10-year Treasury.

"Last week's drop was a knee-jerk reaction that priced in more dire economic expectations," said Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily.

"So far this week, bonds are less panicked after several officials have discussed tariff negotiations and deals. Just this morning, when [Treasury Secretary Scott] Bessent referred to tariffs as a melting ice cube, we saw an immediate reaction in the market. Bottom line, rates took a lead off last week as economic fears surged. Now they're back on base and waiting for the next pitch," he said.

The initial drop in mortgage rates last week had housing watchers cheering a potential boost to the lackluster spring market. Mortgage rates had been moving in a very narrow range since the end of February, lower than last year, but not by much. Homebuyers are also contending with high, and still rising, home prices, as well as dwindling confidence in the broader economy and their own employment.

"The spring housing season is beginning with more sellers and a growing number of homes for sale," said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in its March housing report. "But the high cost of buying coupled with growing economic concerns suggest a sluggish response from buyers in early spring."

The biggest drop in rates so far this year came not last week, but in January and February, when the 30-year fixed mortgage fell from a high of 7.26% to 6.74%. Despite that decline, pending home sales, which are a measure of initial signed contracts on existing homes, and therefore the most recent indicator of activity, rose just 2% in February from January, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales were still 3.6% lower than February 2024.

"Despite the modest monthly increase, contract signings remain well below normal historical levels," said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. "A meaningful decline in mortgage rates would help both demand and supply – demand by boosting affordability, and supply by lessening the power of the mortgage rate lock-in effect."

The next significant move in mortgage rates could come as the market digests new economic data, namely Thursday's consumer price index and Friday's produce price index reports. Both have a strong track record of influencing rate momentum.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European markets.

European markets closed broadly higher on Tuesday, breaking a four-day losing streak fueled by red-hot global tariff tensions.

The regional Stoxx 600 index closed 2.72% higher at 486.9 points. Insurance stocks were 4.08% higher on the day, financial services were up 3.89% and travel was 3.85% higher.

It comes after the Stoxx 600 index ended Monday's session around 4.5% lower, falling to its lowest closing level since January 2024, following days of market volatility and extreme selling.

The equity rebound was reflected globally on Tuesday, kicked off by Asia-Pacific markets and later joined by U.S. stocks. Amid some dip buying, investors also appeared hopeful the U.S. will begin talks that could lead to deals that lower the duties over time.

The world has been rocked by the frequent updates around U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs regime in recent days, and despite stock gains, tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners do not appear to be easing.

Speculation on Monday about a potential tariff pause was quickly shut down by the White House, while Trump threatened to hike tariffs on China by another 50% unless it scrapped retaliatory duties. Beijing last week imposed a 34% tariff on American products in response to Trump announcing his full list of so-called reciprocal tariffs.

Overnight, China's Commerce Ministry said it "resolutely opposes" Trump's threat of escalating tariffs and vowed to take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests.

Also on Monday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU had offered Trump a "zero-for-zero tariffs" deal for industrial goods, and reiterated that the bloc was keen to negotiate but was also prepared to impose countermeasures. Trump promptly rejected the EU's 0% tariff offer, however.

European stock markets closed higher on Tuesday, with the Stoxx 600 index closing up 2.72%.

Gains were broad-based, with France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX both up around 2.5%, as the U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 2.7%.

Paul Donovan, chief economist at Global Wealth Management, discusses the impact of U.S. tariffs on global markets. 

U.S. stocks began Tuesday's session in the green.

The S&P 500 advanced 3.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 3.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained around 3.6%.

The Bank of England is unlikely to overreact and press the "panic button" toward aggressive monetary policy easing as a result of the British currency's underperformance amid U.S. tariffs, according to Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury.

"While sterling has far from been among the worst performing majors (that mantle lies solely with the Australian dollar), the U.K. currency has tanked against the euro in the last few sessions (GBP/USD slumped below the 1.17 level yesterday from 1.20 on Wednesday)," Ryan said.

Sterling was up 0.4% against the dollar at 12:18 p.m. in London. It was also up almost 0.2% against the euro.

"The U.K. is pretty isolated from the tariffs given its low exposure to global demand (particularly the U.S. and China) and the fact that the direct tariffs themselves are low at just 10%. Yet, investors appear to be punishing GBP given its high-risk status and elevated interest rates, which allow room for aggressive easing under a scenario where the Bank of England presses the panic button on the growth outlook."

Ebury is "confident that this underperformance won't last for too much longer," Ryan noted.

"We don't expect the MPC to overreact to the tariffs, and the economic hit will probably transpire to be relatively minimal (troubles at home probably carry greater weight for Britain's economy in our view)," he added.

James Moore, head of capital goods research at Redburn Atlantic, warns of U.S. stagflation and goods dumping in Europe as the Trump administration's tariffs escalate.

London's FTSE 100 led gains among Europe's major bourses on Tuesday, trading 1.6% higher by 11:33 a.m. U.K. time.

The U.K.'s FTSE AIM All-Share index was up by almost 2%.

London-listed shares of British Airways owner IAG jumped 5.1%, while Rolls-Royce added 5% and Games Workshop rose by 4.2%.

European alcohol producers made broad gains on Tuesday morning, after news emerged that the EU had exempted whiskey, wine and dairy products from its 25% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.

Diageo, which makes Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff and Guinness, was up by around 1% at 9:47 a.m. in London, while AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, gained 1.6%.  

Carlsberg and Pernod Ricard, both up by 1%, and Remy Cointreau, up 2.5%, were also among the industry's top movers.

— Chloe Taylor

In a note to clients on Tuesday, strategists at Swiss investment bank UBS argued that now is not the time to cash out of the stock market.

"Even though the market may move even lower in the near term, periods of market stress have historically and consistently offered long-term rewards for diversified investors who look through near-term volatility, stay the course, and/or put fresh money to work," they said.

They noted that there have been 12 occasions since 1945 when the S&P 500 fell by 20% from its peak, all of which had seen the index return significant returns in the subsequent five years.

"Staying invested also reduces the risk of missing significant "up days" for financial markets, which often occur during periods of high volatility," UBS' strategists added.

Strong hedges in the current environment include medium-term bonds, gold, hedge funds and capital preservation, they said.

— Chloe Taylor

Europe's Stoxx Aerospace and Defense index gained around 4% by 9:12 a.m. in London on Tuesday.

It put the index on course to end a four-day losing streak, during which it notched single-session losses of up to 8%.

Sweden's Saab, up 6.7%, Germany's Renk Group, up 6.5%, and Britain's Rolls-Royce, up 5.3%, were among the top movers in the sector on Tuesday morning.

— Chloe Taylor

"After multiple punishing sessions, stock markets appear to have started their road to recovery," Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said in a note on Tuesday.

However, he warned investors to take a cautious approach to the U-turn across global stock markets.

"It's dangerous to think a massive rally will definitely happen, given how [U.S. President Donald] Trump is unpredictable, but the 'just imagine' thought will now be firmly engrained in investors' minds," Mould said.

"Investors need to take each day as it comes … markets could stay fragile for days and weeks to come. It would only take a new sign of aggression from Trump or a trading partner fighting back hard to cause upset again. Market recoveries can quickly lose momentum if investors lose faith in a remedy to the situation that caused the original sell-off."

— Chloe Taylor



The euro was 0.4% higher against the U.S. dollar by 8:43 a.m. in London, trading at around $1.095. 

The currency jumped higher in the immediate aftermath of Trump's reciprocal tariffs announcement on Wednesday, but pared some of those gains on Monday.

— Chloe Taylor

European stocks made broad gains on Tuesday, reversing course after closing sharply lower on Monday.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 was 1.3% higher at 8:16 a.m. in London. Every sector barring telecom was in positive territory, with all major bourses edging higher.

London's FTSE 100 and the French CAC 40 each added around 1.4%, while the German DAX gained 0.8%.

— Chloe Taylor

China's Commerce Ministry said it "resolutely opposes" U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of escalating tariffs, and vowed to take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests.

The comments came after Trump said he would impose an additional 50% duties on U.S. imports from China Wednesday, if Beijing does not withdraw the 34% tariff it imposed on American products last week.

"The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake," the statement said, according to a CNBC translation. "China will never accept it. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end."

Market participants traded about 29 billion shares on Monday, resulting in the highest volume day in at least 18 years, according to FactSet and Nasdaq Trader.

It was a rocky day for stocks, with the S&P 500 briefly touching bear market territory and the Dow Jones Industrial Average seeing a swing of 2,595 points from its low to the high of the session.

Monday's volume surpassed Friday's volume of 26.77 billion shares, as well as the 10-day average volume of 16.94 billion shares.

The U.S. Justice Department abruptly shut down its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, signaling a major shift in how the federal government will handle crypto-related crimes going forward, according to a memo obtained by NBC News Tuesday.

The memo, sent Monday night by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, outlines a decentralized approach in which U.S. Attorneys' Offices will now take the lead on digital asset cases, focusing primarily on crimes involving terrorism.

The memo said efforts would focus on "prosecuting individuals who victimize digital asset investors, or those who use digital assets in furtherance of criminal offenses such as terrorism, narcotics and human trafficking, organized crime, hacking, and cartel and gang financing."

This is the latest in a sweeping set of pro-crypto moves under President Donald Trump aimed at rolling back what his administration views as regulatory overreach.

As part of the reorganization, the Market Integrity and Major Frauds Unit will cease all cryptocurrency enforcement efforts. 

The criminal division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section will continue to play a supporting role by providing guidance and training to Justice Department personnel and acting as a liaison to the digital asset industry.

European markets recorded strong gains on Tuesday, reversing course from a four-day losing streak fueled by red-hot global tariff tensions.

The regional Stoxx 600 index was up 2.8% at 4:20 p.m. in London, extending gains after U.S. stocks opened higher amid hopes the U.S. will be able to make deals that lower the duties over time.

Sterling was up 0.4% against the dollar at 12:18 p.m. in London. It was also up almost 0.2% against the euro.

"The U.K. is pretty isolated from the tariffs given its low exposure to global demand (particularly the U.S. and China) and the fact that the direct tariffs themselves are low at just 10%. Yet, investors appear to be punishing GBP given its high-risk status and elevated interest rates, which allow room for aggressive easing under a scenario where the Bank of England presses the panic button on the growth outlook."

Ebury is "confident that this underperformance won't last for too much longer," Ryan noted.

"We don't expect the MPC to overreact to the tariffs, and the economic hit will probably transpire to be relatively minimal (troubles at home probably carry greater weight for Britain's economy in our view)," he added.

James Moore, head of capital goods research at Redburn Atlantic, warns of U.S. stagflation and goods dumping in Europe as the Trump administration's tariffs escalate.

London's FTSE 100 led gains among Europe's major bourses on Tuesday, trading 1.6% higher by 11:33 a.m. U.K. time.

The U.K.'s FTSE AIM All-Share index was up by almost 2%.

London-listed shares of British Airways owner IAG jumped 5.1%, while Rolls-Royce added 5% and Games Workshop rose by 4.2%.

European alcohol producers made broad gains on Tuesday morning, after news emerged that the EU had exempted whiskey, wine and dairy products from its 25% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.

Diageo, which makes Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff and Guinness, was up by around 1% at 9:47 a.m. in London, while AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, gained 1.6%.  

Carlsberg and Pernod Ricard, both up by 1%, and Remy Cointreau, up 2.5%, were also among the industry's top movers.

In a note to clients on Tuesday, strategists at Swiss investment bank UBS argued that now is not the time to cash out of the stock market.

"Even though the market may move even lower in the near term, periods of market stress have historically and consistently offered long-term rewards for diversified investors who look through near-term volatility, stay the course, and/or put fresh money to work," they said.

They noted that there have been 12 occasions since 1945 when the S&P 500 fell by 20% from its peak, all of which had seen the index return significant returns in the subsequent five years.

"Staying invested also reduces the risk of missing significant "up days" for financial markets, which often occur during periods of high volatility," UBS' strategists added.

Strong hedges in the current environment include medium-term bonds, gold, hedge funds and capital preservation, they said.

Europe's Stoxx Aerospace and Defense index gained around 4% by 9:12 a.m. in London on Tuesday.

It put the index on course to end a four-day losing streak, during which it notched single-session losses of up to 8%.

Sweden's Saab, up 6.7%, Germany's Renk Group, up 6.5%, and Britain's Rolls-Royce, up 5.3%, were among the top movers in the sector on Tuesday morning.

"After multiple punishing sessions, stock markets appear to have started their road to recovery," Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said in a note on Tuesday.

However, he warned investors to take a cautious approach to the U-turn across global stock markets.

"It's dangerous to think a massive rally will definitely happen, given how [U.S. President Donald] Trump is unpredictable, but the 'just imagine' thought will now be firmly engrained in investors' minds," Mould said.

"Investors need to take each day as it comes … markets could stay fragile for days and weeks to come. It would only take a new sign of aggression from Trump or a trading partner fighting back hard to cause upset again. Market recoveries can quickly lose momentum if investors lose faith in a remedy to the situation that caused the original sell-off."

— Chloe Taylor



The euro was 0.4% higher against the U.S. dollar by 8:43 a.m. in London, trading at around $1.095. 

The currency jumped higher in the immediate aftermath of Trump's reciprocal tariffs announcement on Wednesday, but pared some of those gains on Monday.

— Chloe Taylor

European stocks made broad gains on Tuesday, reversing course after closing sharply lower on Monday.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 was 1.3% higher at 8:16 a.m. in London. Every sector barring telecom was in positive territory, with all major bourses edging higher.

London's FTSE 100 and the French CAC 40 each added around 1.4%, while the German DAX gained 0.8%.

— Chloe Taylor

China's Commerce Ministry said it "resolutely opposes" U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of escalating tariffs, and vowed to take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests.

The comments came after Trump said he would impose an additional 50% duties on U.S. imports from China Wednesday, if Beijing does not withdraw the 34% tariff it imposed on American products last week.

"The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake," the statement said, according to a CNBC translation. "China will never accept it. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end."

Market participants traded about 29 billion shares on Monday, resulting in the highest volume day in at least 18 years, according to FactSet and Nasdaq Trader.

It was a rocky day for stocks, with the S&P 500 briefly touching bear market territory and the Dow Jones Industrial Average seeing a swing of 2,595 points from its low to the high of the session.

Monday's volume surpassed Friday's volume of 26.77 billion shares, as well as the 10-day average volume of 16.94 billion shares.

Stocks surged Tuesday in a slight reprieve from the tariff market turmoil, on rising hopes the U.S. would reach trade deals to lower the duties over time.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 889points, or 2.3%. The S&P 500 jumped 2.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.8%. 

Trump posted on Truth Social Tuesday that he had a "great call" with the acting president of South Korea, and that China "also wants to make a deal badly." 

This comes amid a series of comments from White House officials that the U.S. is in negotiation talks with trading partners. 

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's told CNBC on Tuesday that around 70 countries had approached the U.S. for tariff negotiations. "If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals," Bessent said. "And part of the calculus of that may be that some part of the tariffs stay on." 

The rebound come after three days of steep losses and violent volatility. Monday marked the highest trading volume for U.S. markets in at least 18 years, at roughly 29 billion shares. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 1,700 points at one point in the session. Between the day's highs and lows, the index swung 2,595 points. The blue-chip index ultimately closed down by 349 points, or 0.9%.

The S&P 500 briefly entered bear market territory at the lows of Monday's session, down more than 20% from its record, before rebounding slightly and finishing the session slightly lower. The benchmark lost 10% in two days to end last week, its worst losses since 2020 during the outbreak of Covid, on fears that Trump's shockingly high tariff rates on most of the world will lead to a recession.

Despite Tuesday's gains on growing optimism for tariff negotiations, investors will need to see more stability in trade policy for the bounce to have legs, according to Robert Ruggirello, chief investment officer at Brave Eagle Wealth Management.

"There has to be some staying power, something [where] corporations can make longer-term capital allocation decisions. They have to have confidence in a consistent policy," said Ruggirello. 

Apple, which was among the hardest-hit stocks due to its exposure to China, surged 4% Tuesday. Other megacap tech stocks were higher on the day, Nvidia and Meta Platforms gained around 5% each. Tesla shares also rallied more than 6%, while Amazon and Netflix were up more than 4% each.

The CBOE Volatility Index – known as Wall Street's so-called fear gauge – spiked to about 60 on Monday, an extreme level that could signal a technical bounce was due. On Tuesday, it broke back below 40.

Tuesday's stock rally was broad based, with 474 S&P 500 advancers during midday trading. 

All 11 S&P 500 sectors were trading in positive territory, with information technology the best-performing sector, while materials was the biggest laggard. 

Information technology, which was up by more than 4%, was buoyed by a number of chip stocks. Shares of Palantir Technologies and Western Digital climbed more than 8%, each. Broadcom gained 8%. Nvidia rose more than 6%.

Humana was the top-performing stock, rallying along with other health care companies after Wall Street Journal reported the Trump administration will raise payment rates for Medicare insurers next year. Humana was last higher by 10%. CVS Health, which was the third-best performing stock in the S&P 500, jumped more than 8%.

Semiconductor funds on Tuesday headed for their best days in several months as the market rebounded.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) jumped more than 5% and 4%, respectively, as of shortly before 10:15 a.m. ET. Both were tracking for their biggest one-day gains since August.

Marvell Technology and Broadcom led the sector higher, rallying more than 9% and 8%, respectively. Retail investor favorite Nvidia also climbed, with shares of the artificial intelligence titan popping more than 7%.

Still, the SMH ETF has dropped more than 8% compared with where it traded five sessions earlier. The SOXX fund has plunged around 10% over that period.

— Alex Harring

The Russell 2000 jumped more than 3% Tuesday, reversing Monday's losses to turn positive for the week. 

Month to date, the benchmark small cap index remains 7.3% lower following the broad selloff on fears President Donald Trump's tariff policy could lead to a recession.

Apple's tumbling stock price presents an "enhanced buying opportunity for investors to own a high-quality name," said Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan 

The iPhone maker's shares have fallen about 25% so far this year due in large part to geopolitical uncertainty around Trump's tariffs and the delay of Siri features with artificial intelligence, Mohan said. 

But the tech company has typically booked gains in the 12 months after an event that narrows its price-to-earnings ratio, the analyst told clients in a Tuesday note. 

It's possible that the risk of tariff escalation with China could pose a more severe threat to Wall Street's consensus estimates for Apple, Mohan said. 

But Apple has options to mitigate downside risk, including shifting production to India, increasing prices, change the pace of product releases, and wringing efficiencies out of its supply chain.

Billionaire investor Ray Dalio said he's worried about negative impact of Trump's tariffs as they drive up costs and lower corporate revenue.

"What does it mean for a company? It means costs are going to go up, revenue is going to go down, and capital is going to be harder to come by," Dalio said Tuesday on CNBC's "Squawk Box." "I am very concerned about the solution ... the practicality of the solution."

The founder of Bridgewater, one of the world's largest hedge funds, said it will also create "great sand in the gears of production worldwide" at the same time.

U.S. stocks began Tuesday's session in the green. 

The S&P 500 advanced 3.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 3.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained around 3.6%.

Small business confidence waned in March as the outlook for future conditions decreased by the most in more than four years, according to the National Federation for Independent Business.

The NFIB's headline optimism index hit 97.4 for the moth, down 3.3 points from February and below the Dow Jones estimate for 98.7. In addition, the net share of owners expecting better business conditions tumbled 16 points to 21%, the biggest monthly fall since December 2020.

"The implementation of new policy priorities has heightened the level of uncertainty among small business owners over the past few months," said NFIB chief economist Bill Dunkelberg. "Small business owners have scaled back expectations on sales growth as they better understand how these rearrangements might impact them."

—Jeff Cox

Monday's trading session saw the highest trading volume on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) since 2020, which could signal a short-term bottom in the stock market, according to BTIG technical strategist Jonathan Krinsky.

"Over the past ten years, the four prior largest notional volume days all marked tactical lows, but all of those were re-tested and in some cases meaningfully broken over the ensuing weeks. In three of those four cases the high notional volume day also marked the intraday peak for VIX," Krinsky said in a note to clients. The "VIX" refers to the Cboe Volatility Index.

"We think this set-up is likely this time around in that we are seeing 'a' bottom for stocks and peak for VIX, but then re-test and possibly break to lower lows over the coming weeks/months," Krinsky continued.

The bounce could be substantial, as historical precedents suggest the S&P 500 may cut its recent losses in half before turning lower again, Krinsky said.

Chipmaker Micron Technology is considering applying a tariff-related surcharge on certain customers beginning April 9, according to a report from Reuters.

The company previously indicated the possibility of such a plan during its earnings call on Mar. 20.

President Donald Trump's retaliatory tariffs on major trading partners are set to take effect on April 9.

Micron shares jumped 4% Tuesday before the bell.

Apple shares have plunged 19% over the last three trading sessions, marking its worst three-day performance since 2001, according to Goldman Sachs.

During this period, the iPhone maker has lost around $638 billion in market capitalization, per CNBC estimates. This is a larger value than the market capitalization of 489 companies in the S&P 500.

Shares added 1.3% Tuesday before the bell.

— Hakyung Kim, Tom Rotunno

Broadcom shares popped 3% in the premarket after the chipmaker announced a $10 billion share repurchase program authorization through year-end. 

The announcement "reflects the board's confidence in the strength of Broadcom's diversified semiconductor and infrastructure software product franchises. In particular, we are uniquely positioned in mission critical infrastructure software and enabling hyperscalers to drive innovation in generative AI into their expanding subscriber platforms," CEO Hock Tan said in a statement.

Levi Strauss shares are up more than 1% in extended trading after reporting a fiscal first-quarter earnings beat and reiterating its full year outlook. The catch is the forecast excludes any impacts from the Trump administration's tariffs.

Telsey Advisory Group CEO Dana Telsey told CNBC's "Closing Bell Overtime" that Levi's management is giving themselve some "wiggle room" by not raising their earnings estimates after its latest beat. However, she expects the tariffs are going to put pressure on retailers.

"The diversification of sourcing that they talked about is certainly critical, but prices are going up," Telsey said.

Telsey said investors should stick with companies that have U.S. manufacturing like Bath & Body Works, are known for value or sell products like groceries that you can't live without. She named TJX, Burlington and Costco as examples.

Elon Musk escalated his own sort of trade war Tuesday morning — not against another country, but against President Donald Trump's top trade advisor, Peter Navarro.

Musk responded to a video of Navarro speaking on CNBC, writing in a post on X that "Navarro is truly a moron."

He followed up by saying: "Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks."

Less than 20 minutes later, Musk shot out yet another insult, correcting another user's spelling of Navarro's name with a play on the R-word: "*Peter Retarrdo."

Tuesday's posts are the latest in a string of anti-tariff comments from Musk, who said over the weekend that America should establish a "zero-tariff" system with Europe. Musk, who has been heading up Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. A representative from the White House directed BI to a post on X quoting the press secretary Karoline Leavitt's response to the recent insults.

"Whatever. We are the most transparent administration in history, expressing our disagreements in public," Leavitt said in the post. She also addressed the spat during a press briefing later Tuesday at the White House

"These are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and tariffs," she said. "Boys will be boys and we will let their public sparring continue."

For his part, Navarro, Trump's senior advisor for trade and manufacturing, has also fired shots at Musk. During a Sunday interview on Fox News, he said that Musk is great "when he's in his DOGE lane" but is protecting his own business interests when it comes to criticizing the wide-ranging tariffs Trump announced last week. During the same interview, Navarro said that things are "fine" between the two men and "there's no rift there."

Yet Navarro turned up the heat on Monday when he appeared on CNBC, possibly prompting Musk's recent comments.

"He's not a car manufacturer. He's a car assembler in many cases," Navarro said, saying that Tesla gets car parts from foreign nations.

The markets continue to be roiled by the tariff chaos, with US stocks surging Tuesday morning after a painful three-day sell-off.

Stocks surged Tuesday in a slight reprieve from the tariff market turmoil, on rising hopes the U.S. would reach trade deals to lower the duties over time.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 924 points, or 2.4%. The S&P 500 jumped 2.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.9%. The three major averages were on track for their best session since Nov. 2022. 

Trump posted on Truth Social Tuesday that he had a "great call" with the acting president of South Korea, and that China "also wants to make a deal badly." 

This comes amid a series of comments from White House officials that the U.S. is in negotiation talks with trading partners. 

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's told CNBC on Tuesday that around 70 countries had approached the U.S. for tariff negotiations. "If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals," Bessent said. "And part of the calculus of that may be that some part of the tariffs stay on." 

The rebound come after three days of steep losses and violent volatility. Monday marked the highest trading volume for U.S. markets in at least 18 years, at roughly 29 billion shares. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 1,700 points at one point in the session. Between the day's highs and lows, the index swung 2,595 points. The blue-chip index ultimately closed down by 349 points, or 0.9%.

The S&P 500 briefly entered bear market territory at the lows of Monday's session, down more than 20% from its record, before rebounding slightly and finishing the session slightly lower. The benchmark lost 10% in two days to end last week, its worst losses since 2020 during the outbreak of Covid, on fears that Trump's shockingly high tariff rates on most of the world will lead to a recession.

Despite Tuesday's gains on growing optimism for tariff negotiations, investors will need to see more stability in trade policy for the bounce to have legs, according to Robert Ruggirello, chief investment officer at Brave Eagle Wealth Management.

"There has to be some staying power, something [where] corporations can make longer-term capital allocation decisions. They have to have confidence in a consistent policy," said Ruggirello. 

Apple, which was among the hardest-hit stocks due to its exposure to China, surged 4% Tuesday. Other megacap tech stocks were higher on the day, Nvidia and Meta Platforms gained around 5% each. Tesla shares also rallied more than 6%, while Amazon and Netflix were up more than 4% each.

The CBOE Volatility Index – known as Wall Street's so-called fear gauge – spiked to about 60 on Monday, an extreme level that could signal a technical bounce was due. On Tuesday, it broke back below 40.

Tuesday's stock rally was broad based, with 474 S&P 500 advancers during midday trading. 

All 11 S&P 500 sectors were trading in positive territory, with information technology the best-performing sector, while materials was the biggest laggard. 

Information technology, which was up by more than 4%, was buoyed by a number of chip stocks. Shares of Palantir Technologies and Western Digital climbed more than 8%, each. Broadcom gained 8%. Nvidia rose more than 6%.

Humana was the top-performing stock, rallying along with other health care companies after Wall Street Journal reported the Trump administration will raise payment rates for Medicare insurers next year. Humana was last higher by 10%. CVS Health, which was the third-best performing stock in the S&P 500, jumped more than 8%.

Semiconductor funds on Tuesday headed for their best days in several months as the market rebounded.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) jumped more than 5% and 4%, respectively, as of shortly before 10:15 a.m. ET. Both were tracking for their biggest one-day gains since August.

Marvell Technology and Broadcom led the sector higher, rallying more than 9% and 8%, respectively. Retail investor favorite Nvidia also climbed, with shares of the artificial intelligence titan popping more than 7%.

Still, the SMH ETF has dropped more than 8% compared with where it traded five sessions earlier. The SOXX fund has plunged around 10% over that period.

— Alex Harring

The Russell 2000 jumped more than 3% Tuesday, reversing Monday's losses to turn positive for the week. 

Month to date, the benchmark small cap index remains 7.3% lower following the broad selloff on fears President Donald Trump's tariff policy could lead to a recession. 

— Hakyung Kim

Apple's tumbling stock price presents an "enhanced buying opportunity for investors to own a high-quality name," said Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan 

The iPhone maker's shares have fallen about 25% so far this year due in large part to geopolitical uncertainty around Trump's tariffs and the delay of Siri features with artificial intelligence, Mohan said. 

But the tech company has typically booked gains in the 12 months after an event that narrows its price-to-earnings ratio, the analyst told clients in a Tuesday note. 

It's possible that the risk of tariff escalation with China could pose a more severe threat to Wall Street's consensus estimates for Apple, Mohan said. 

But Apple has options to mitigate downside risk, including shifting production to India, increasing prices, change the pace of product releases, and wringing efficiencies out of its supply chain. 

— Spencer Kimball

Billionaire investor Ray Dalio said he's worried about negative impact of Trump's tariffs as they drive up costs and lower corporate revenue. 

"What does it mean for a company? It means costs are going to go up, revenue is going to go down, and capital is going to be harder to come by," Dalio said Tuesday on CNBC's "Squawk Box." "I am very concerned about the solution ... the practicality of the solution."

The founder of Bridgewater, one of the world's largest hedge funds, said it will also create "great sand in the gears of production worldwide" at the same time.

— Yun Li

U.S. stocks began Tuesday's session in the green. 

The S&P 500 advanced 3.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 3.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained around 3.6%. 

— Hakyung Kim

Small business confidence waned in March as the outlook for future conditions decreased by the most in more than four years, according to the National Federation for Independent Business.

The NFIB's headline optimism index hit 97.4 for the moth, down 3.3 points from February and below the Dow Jones estimate for 98.7. In addition, the net share of owners expecting better business conditions tumbled 16 points to 21%, the biggest monthly fall since December 2020.

"The implementation of new policy priorities has heightened the level of uncertainty among small business owners over the past few months," said NFIB chief economist Bill Dunkelberg. "Small business owners have scaled back expectations on sales growth as they better understand how these rearrangements might impact them."

—Jeff Cox

Monday's trading session saw the highest trading volume on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) since 2020, which could signal a short-term bottom in the stock market, according to BTIG technical strategist Jonathan Krinsky.

"Over the past ten years, the four prior largest notional volume days all marked tactical lows, but all of those were re-tested and in some cases meaningfully broken over the ensuing weeks. In three of those four cases the high notional volume day also marked the intraday peak for VIX," Krinsky said in a note to clients. The "VIX" refers to the Cboe Volatility Index.

"We think this set-up is likely this time around in that we are seeing 'a' bottom for stocks and peak for VIX, but then re-test and possibly break to lower lows over the coming weeks/months," Krinsky continued.

The bounce could be substantial, as historical precedents suggest the S&P 500 may cut its recent losses in half before turning lower again, Krinsky said.

— Jesse Pound

Chipmaker Micron Technology is considering applying a tariff-related surcharge on certain customers beginning April 9, according to a report from Reuters.

The company previously indicated the possibility of such a plan during its earnings call on Mar. 20.

President Donald Trump's retaliatory tariffs on major trading partners are set to take effect on April 9.

Micron shares jumped 4% Tuesday before the bell.

Apple shares have plunged 19% over the last three trading sessions, marking its worst three-day performance since 2001, according to Goldman Sachs.

During this period, the iPhone maker has lost around $638 billion in market capitalization, per CNBC estimates. This is a larger value than the market capitalization of 489 companies in the S&P 500.

Shares added 1.3% Tuesday before the bell.

— Hakyung Kim, Tom Rotunno

Broadcom shares popped 3% in the premarket after the chipmaker announced a $10 billion share repurchase program authorization through year-end. 

The announcement "reflects the board's confidence in the strength of Broadcom's diversified semiconductor and infrastructure software product franchises. In particular, we are uniquely positioned in mission critical infrastructure software and enabling hyperscalers to drive innovation in generative AI into their expanding subscriber platforms," CEO Hock Tan said in a statement. 

— Fred Imbert

European stocks made broad gains on Tuesday, reversing course after closing sharply lower on Monday.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 was 1.3% higher at 8:16 a.m. in London. Every sector barring telecom was in positive territory, with all major bourses edging higher.

London's FTSE 100 and the French CAC 40 each added around 1.4%, while the German DAX gained 0.8%.

— Chloe Taylor

Levi Strauss shares are up more than 1% in extended trading after reporting a fiscal first-quarter earnings beat and reiterating its full year outlook. The catch is the forecast excludes any impacts from the Trump administration's tariffs.

Telsey Advisory Group CEO Dana Telsey told CNBC's "Closing Bell Overtime" that Levi's management is giving themselve some "wiggle room" by not raising their earnings estimates after its latest beat. However, she expects the tariffs are going to put pressure on retailers.

"The diversification of sourcing that they talked about is certainly critical, but prices are going up," Telsey said.

Telsey said investors should stick with companies that have U.S. manufacturing like Bath & Body Works, are known for value or sell products like groceries that you can't live without. She named TJX, Burlington and Costco as examples.

— Christina Cheddar Berk

Market participants traded about 29 billion shares on Monday, resulting in the highest volume day in at least 18 years, according to FactSet and Nasdaq Trader.

It was a rocky day for stocks, with the S&P 500 briefly touching bear market territory and the Dow Jones Industrial Average seeing a swing of 2,595 points from its low to the high of the session.

Monday's volume surpassed Friday's volume of 26.77 billion shares, as well as the 10-day average volume of 16.94 billion shares.

Stock futures opened higher on Monday evening after another volatile session on Wall Street.

Futures tied to the S&P 500, along with Nasdaq-100 futures, gained 0.6%. Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 321 points, or 0.8%.

This is CNBC's live coverage of how the White House, U.S. trade partners and employers are responding to President Donald Trump's historic tariffs.

What you need to know

CNBC's reporters are covering the tariffs and their effects, live on air and online from our bureaus in Washington; London; Singapore; San Francisco; and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.

A growing part of Walmart's business could make it more resilient against tariffs and a possible recession.

Walmart's membership program Walmart+ is growing — and the company says it is driving loyalty among customers. Subscribers accounted for nearly half of all spending on Walmart's website and app in its most recent fiscal year, the company told CNBC. 

That gives Walmart a few advantages if Trump's tariffs raise its input costs or trigger an economic downturn. As the memberships are highly profitable, they give Walmart room to keep prices of groceries and other staples low even if the company's expenses increase.

Walmart+ is gaining ground at a good time for Walmart. The retailer gave a financial outlook that disappointed Wall Street in February — even before Trump announced the steep duties on key U.S. trade partners.

— Jacob Pramuk and Melissa Repko

Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky tore into the zero-sum view of trade that Trump has repeatedly espoused in defense of his sweeping tariff plans.

"It's based on a fallacy" that "somehow, in a trade, someone must lose," Paul said on CNBC's "Squawk Box."

The idea that "someone's taking advantage of you, and China is ripping you off or Japan is ripping you off — it's absolutely a fallacy," he said.

"Every trade that occurs in the marketplace is mutually beneficial," said the like-minded son of the staunchly libertarian former congressman Ron Paul. "If you have a free society and I want to trade with you, if you want to sell me your coat and I give you $200 for it, we both agree to it and we're both happy."

"The trade is always a win-win."

— Kevin Breuninger

California Rep. Ro Khanna says Trump's tariffs have been hitting his district in Silicon Valley hard, especially with delayed IPOs and mergers.

"I'm hearing that these are some of the most self-destructive, wealth-destroying policies that any modern president has had," Khanna said on CNBC's "Squawk Box."

The Democrat said the tariffs have hurt not just the tech companies, but also the manufacturers.

Khanna also singled out Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, calling Lutnick's claim that tariffs would lead to more iPhone production false.

"I know Lutnick loves 19th-century policies, but he should understand 21st-century production," Khanna said.

Khanna's suggestion for Trump? "Bring in new people on an economic team, assure the country you're never going to do blanket tariffs again, that was a mistake, and that you're going to look at things sector by sector."

– Laya Neelakandan

Businesses and consumers want certainty as Trump's steep tariffs loom, says Levi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass.

"The number one thing that everybody's wrestling with right now, ourselves, the industry and most importantly, the consumer, everybody is wrestling with the uncertainty that's out there. We need some clarity," she said on CNBC's "Mad Money."

The denim retailer reported first-quarter results earlier today, and maintained its earnings and sales outlook for the year. Levi's did not include the effects of the new duties in its guidance.

Any price hikes the company makes to offset the tariffs would be "surgical," she said on the company's earnings call.

Levi's manufactures some of its products in countries like Cambodia and Vietnam, which will face 49% and 46% tariffs, respectively, under Trump's plan.

— Jacob Pramuk

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is sharply escalating his attacks on top Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro as he defends his car company and chafes against the administration's tariff plans.

"Tesla has the most American-made cars. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks," Musk, Trump's top campaign donor, wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.

"Navarro is truly a moron. What he says here is demonstrably false," Musk wrote in another post.

Musk was responding to Navarro's contention in a CNBC interview on Monday that Musk is not a car manufacturer but a car "assembler" whose vehicles are made of many parts sourced from overseas.

Days earlier, Musk in a since-deleted X post said Navarro "ain't built s---." In a separate post, Musk questioned Navarro's credentials, writing, "A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing."

Musk currently works for Trump as head of the White House DOGE initiative. As Trump commits to his staunchly protectionist agenda, Musk has recently signaled his support for free-trade policies.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shrugged off questions about Musk's attacks on his colleague.

"Whatever," Leavitt told CNBC's Eamon Javers. "We are the most transparent administration in history expressing our disagreements in public."

— Kevin Breuninger and Eamon Javers

Cambodia is being hit with the biggest single nation tariff rate of all, at 49%.

This has major implications for its factories, now in a fight to survive the next few months if the tariffs are implemented, as retail partners freeze orders. 

Its one million workers, many of whom are women at the low-end of the global income distribution pie, are facing financial ruin. 

But a U.S. trade group that represents retailers reliant on Cambodia says factories now based in Cambodia will "absolutely not" be coming back to the U.S. 

Instead, they will seek out alternative manufacturing locations in lower tariff regimes.

Read the full story: Cambodia, hit with Trump's steepest tariffs, 'absolutely not' sending factories back to U.S., says trade group

— Lori Ann LaRocco

Trump says China "wants to make a deal" as his deadline for steep new tariffs draws near, but adds that Beijing has not yet reached out to the United States.

"They don't know how to get it started. We are waiting for their call. It will happen!" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Trump also held what he described as a "great call" with South Korea's acting president, Han Duck-soo. 

"We have the confines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries."

— Kevin Breuninger

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says China is playing with a "losing hand" in the escalating tariff back-and-forth between the two countries.

"I think it was a big mistake, this Chinese escalation, because they're playing with a pair of twos," Bessent said on "Squawk Box." 

Other countries appear to be more willing to negotiate than China, he said.

"If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals," he said, "and part of the calculus of that may be that some part of the tariffs stay on."

Last night, members of the administration discussed which countries to prioritize for trade talks, he added.

— Jesse Pound

Founder and CEO of Citadel Ken Griffin is taking aim at Trump's tariffs, calling them a a "huge policy mistake" that will hurt middle-class Americans. 

"I am really afraid of us abdicating our role of leadership for the free world," Griffin said at an event for the 100th anniversary of the University of Miami, per Bloomberg.

"That's the path we're on," the GOP donor adds. 

— Erin Doherty 

Stephane Boujnah, CEO of Euronext, says the recent market selloff is not a sign of panic, but simply a rotation of assets.

"Since this began, money is leaving the United States to be reinvested in Europe," Boujnah said in an interview with France Inter radio today. 

Investors, he said, are struggling to navigate Trump's unpredictability, which is making the U.S. "unrecognizable."

"We are mourning the United States that we knew … which was very similar in values and institutions to Europe," he said. "Now it looks more like an emerging country."

Euronext operates markets in various European cities, including Paris, Milan, Amsterdam, Brussels and Dublin.

— Chloe Taylor

Historical allies the U.S. and European Union should have zero tariffs between them, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen urged amid the bloc's ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of 20% White House duties it was slapped with last week.

"Engaging in a global trade war is the surest way to achieve a global recession," Valtonen she said during a press conference, in comments reported by Reuters. "But of course the European Union now has to react to what the U.S. has put forward,

The EU has previously expressed willingness to take steps against Washington if negotiations fail, but it has yet to specify the nature and extent of these potential countermeasures.

U.S. markets are poised to open higher this morning, after three days of steep losses. 

Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rebounded 747 points, or 2%. Futures tied to the S&P 500 were up 1.5%, while Nasdaq-100 futures gained about 1.3%.

Asian markets also closed higher Tuesday, staunching a decline fueled by Trump's tariff rollout that has seen the biggest losses since the pandemic.

— Sean Conlon

Von der Leyen and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held "constructive" talks today that touch on a possible mechanism for trade diversion in the wake of sweeping levies announced by the world's first economy.

"In response to the widespread disruption caused by the US tariffs, President von der Leyen stressed the responsibility of Europe and China, as two of world's largest markets, to support a strong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field," according to an EU readout, which added that von der Leyen called for a "negotiated resolution to the current situation" that avoids escalation.

"The leaders discussed setting up a mechanism for tracking possible trade diversion and ensuring any developments are duly addressed," the readout said.

Speculation has been mounting whether Trump's protectionist agenda will push U.S. trade partners toward China in a bid to redress commercial relations.

The conversation between the Beijing administration and the EU chief takes place after Washington last Wednesday slapped China and the EU with reciprocal tariffs of 34% and 20%, respectively. Beijing has already retaliated with its own 34% levies on the U.S., which is now threatening further countermeasures.

— Ruxandra Iordache

The newly confirmed U.S. Trade Representative, Jamieson Greer, will testify before the Senate Finance Committee today at a hearing on "The President's 2025 Trade Policy Agenda." 

Greer's testimony will offer the Senate one of its first opportunities to question a Trump administration official about the president's trade and tariff policy since Trump unveiled the sweeping new tariff regime. 

The hearing will begin at 10:00 a.m. ET, and CNBC.com will stream the hearing on our liveblog.

— Christina Wilkie

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez will visit China and Vietnam later this week, as Europe prepares to absorb the impacts of a new 20% tariff rate.

Sanchez is scheduled to visit Hanoi on Wednesday, the same day the new Trump tariff rates go into effect. Then he will go to Beijing, according to his office.

The visit underscores the pressure on EU bloc countries like Spain to reassess their trade relationships in the wake of Trump's tariffs.

Among the top goals for President Donald Trump and his administration in hitting trading partners with steep tariffs is bringing manufacturing capacity back to the U.S., even if it comes at the price of short-term market and economic duress. But in Cambodia, the Asian country hit with the highest tariff rate of any in the new trade plan, that goal is highly unlikely.

While the 49% tariff rate that the Trump administration is placing on Cambodian goods will lead to an existential crisis for Cambodian factories and workers already at the low end of global income distribution, reshoring of its manufacturing to the U.S. is not going to happen, according to a trade group that represents U.S. interests in the retail manufacturing hub.

"They're absolutely not going to go back to the United States," said Casey Barnett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, the trade association representing U.S. companies manufacturing in Cambodia. "I can't imagine that Americans want to sit down and sew a pair of sweatpants for long hours of the day," Barnett said.

Barnett said manufacturers in Cambodia are looking at other countries to mitigate the tariffs, but the U.S. is not among the options. Some companies are looking to move their supply chains to Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, India and Indonesia. Other companies are moving more slowly, thinking there might be a reversal on the tariffs.

Factories in Cambodia are by no means in a good position for the moment, according to Barnett, looking for ways to survive for the next few months.

"The labor-intensive garment factories here in Cambodia simply cannot continue to operate with a 49% additional tariff. They can't survive and are looking for alternatives," he said.

For now, at least, no new orders are being placed. "There are orders being paused. Everyone's facing uncertainty and they want to wait a bit to see how the dust settles," Barnett added.

The Cambodian government is working on a number of steps to mitigate the pressure, such as fiscal policies, including tax credits.

Under Armour, Rawlings Sporting Goods, Lululemon, Black & Decker, Hugo Boss, Hearth & Home, Eddie Bauer, Dollar General, Diageo, Asics, Adidas and Bass Pro Shops are among the retail companies that import from Cambodia to North America. There is an ever-wider list of items imported from garments to footwear, travel goods, bicycles, agriculture products, furniture, solar panels, tires and kitchen cabinets.

Andrei Quinn-Barabanov, supply chain industry practice lead at Moody's, says that even if companies manufacture as cheaply as possible, relocating supply chains is a major investment.

"Supply chain investments are meant to be longer term and when you have tremendous uncertainty like this you are unlikely to make these decisions. Companies will wait to see what the tariff response will be from other countries, as well as nontariff restrictions they will put on U.S. companies. You will have very little executive decision-making."

The White House has claimed that Cambodia's tariffs on the U.S. reach as high as 97%, a claim disputed by the country, as well as by multiple sources of tariffs data, including the World Trade Organization. The Observatory of Economic Complexity, which also studies trade data, says some consumer products such as snacks, cosmetics and automobiles can see much higher tariffs than the average, as high as 35%, in Cambodia. The U.S. average tariff on Cambodian goods is 2.6%.

The administration has continued to argue that the return of manufacturing to the U.S. will ultimately lead to greater revenue for the U.S. "If we put up a tariff wall, the ultimate goal would be to bring jobs back to the U.S. But in the meantime, we will be collecting substantial tariffs," Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday on CNBC. "If we're successful, tariffs would be a melting ice cube, in a way, because you're taking in the revenues as the manufacturing facilities are built in the U.S., and there should be some level of symmetry between the taxes we begin taking in with the new industry from the payroll taxes as the tariffs decline."

Andre C. Winters, founder and principal of supply chain consultancy and planning company HudsonWinters, recently told CNBC he is doubtful that companies will bring manufacturing back to the U.S. in a hurry. "This trade war is not an incentive to come back to the United States," said Winters. "Companies will look to other countries that are being hit with lower tariffs. If I'm paying 40% in Vietnam and I can get 20% tariff in another country, I'll go there, because in the end, it is still cheaper than coming back to America."

Barnett said the U.S. consumer will be footing at least part of the bill, as many companies have warned.

"Unfortunately, it's going to push up the prices for the American consumer," he said. "Cambodia's been helping American families buy those back-to-school clothes at an affordable price. These tariffs are simply going to raise prices for American families and not bring manufacturing back to the U.S."

Bringing manufacturing back to the United States is not the only reason for the Trump tariffs plan, according to President Trump and his trade advisors, with reducing the nation's trade deficit and debt, and enabling tax cuts, also critical to their strategy, and that has become clear as nations begin to offer tariff concessions.

Cambodia's prime minister sent a letter to the Trump administration in recent days outlining significant reductions in tariff rates for U.S. goods. Vietnam offered to take tariffs on U.S. imports to 0%, an offer that Trump noted, but that the Trump administration later indicated would not be enough for the administration to lift its new levies.

Trade deficits and "nontariff cheating" are as important, said White House trade advisor Peter Navarro on Monday in a CNBC interview, in rejecting the premise of the Vietnamese offer.

In a comparison of trade deficits, Cambodia ranks low on the list compared with many international manufacturing nations. U.S. goods trade with Cambodia totaled an estimated $13 billion in 2024, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. U.S. goods exports to Cambodia in 2024 were $321.6 million, up 4.9% ($14.9 million) from 2023. U.S. goods imported from Cambodia totaled $12.7 billion in 2024, up 9.3% ($1.1 billion) from 2023. The U.S. goods trade deficit with Cambodia was $12.3 billion in 2024 and is not in the top 10 of trade deficits.

Trump advisors have used the term "burden sharing" to discuss the broader philosophy behind the aggressive tariffs stance and argue other countries will bear the cost of tariffs. Many economists have pointed to the risks tied to hitting some of the poorest nations in the world with high tariffs. Cambodia is among the 11 nations that account for a small part of the U.S. trade deficit but have exports to the U.S. representing more than 10% of their GDP, according to the Center for Global Development. "For people working in the apparel industry, the conditions are harsh, but the wages these jobs offer represent a real opportunity, particularly for women," it noted.

Barnett echoed those fears, saying the tariff rates will only increase poverty in Cambodia, lead to the loss of jobs, and further widen the trade deficit.

"There's a bit of a panic and that's tragic because there are 1 million of the world's poorest people currently employed in this industry here in Cambodia, and many of them are women trying to make ends meet. Their monthly salary is around $300," Barnett said. "Cambodia is between a rock and a hard place."

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday the U.S. holds a substantial advantage over China as the two nations exchange threats in a burgeoning trade war.

"I think it was a big mistake, this Chinese escalation, because they're playing with a pair of twos," Bessent said during an interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box." "What do we lose by the Chinese raising tariffs on us? We export one-fifth to them of what they export to us, so that is a losing hand for them."

The comments come a day ahead of the U.S. raising its duties on China and dozens of other nations as part of so-called reciprocal tariffs whose purpose, Bessent said, is to bring trading partners to the negotiating table and jobs back to the U.S.

So far, he said Japan has been at the forefront of countries eager to negotiate, and the White House expects a multitude of others.

"I think you are going to see some very large countries with large trade deficits come forward very quickly," Bessent said. "If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals."

Ultimately, the hope would be to generate both jobs and revenue from the tariffs, he added.

"If we put up a tariff wall, the ultimate goal would be to bring jobs back to the U.S. But in the meantime, we will be collecting substantial tariffs," Bessent said. "If we're successful, tariffs would be a melting ice cube, in a way, because you're taking in the revenues as the manufacturing facilities are built in the U.S., and there should be some level of symmetry between the taxes we begin taking in with the new industry from the payroll taxes as the tariffs decline."

While he said some 70 countries have reached out to the White House to begin talks, China has vowed it will "fight to the end" and has imposed 34% tariffs on U.S. products.

In return, President Donald Trump said he will slap another 50% charge on Chinese imports if the tariff is not withdrawn. The U.S. in 2024 ran a nearly $300 billion trade deficit with China, or about one-third of the entire imbalance.

With the tariffs, Trump is hoping to open up more markets for American products and reshore manufacturing operations to the U.S. However, the administration is not simply focusing on absolute tariff levels from other nations but rather nontariff barriers such as currency manipulation, Europe's value-added tax and other methods the White House says undermine fair trade.

"Everything is on the table," Bessent said. "The academic literature shows that it's actually the nontariff barriers which are harder, both harder to quantify and ... they're more insidious because they're hidden, they're obfuscated."

Stock market futures, which already had been indicating a strong open on Wall Street, added to gains after Bessent spoke.

Walgreens on Tuesday reported fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue that topped expectations, as the retail drugstore giant benefits from cost cuts and prepares to go private.

The company is in the process of being taken private by Sycamore Partners in a roughly $10 billion deal that is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year. Walgreens withdrew its fiscal 2025 guidance given the pending transaction. In January, it said it expects a full-year adjusted profit of $1.40 to $1.80 per share. 

The historic deal with Sycamore ends Walgreens' tumultuous run as a public company, which began in 1927. The company is shuttering stores and cutting other costs as it gets squeezed by pharmacy reimbursement headwinds, softer consumer spending, and competition from its main rival CVS, grocery and retail chains, and Amazon. It's also grappling with a troubled push into health care.

Shares of Walgreens rose nearly 2% in premarket trading on Tuesday.

Here's what Walgreens reported for the three-month period ended Feb. 28 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

"Second quarter results reflect disciplined cost management and improvement in U.S. Healthcare, which were partially offset by weaker front-end results in U.S. Retail Pharmacy, while significant legal settlements resulted in continued negative free cash flow," Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth said in a release.

"We remain in the early stages of our turnaround plan, and continue to expect that meaningful value creation will take time, enhanced focus and balancing future cash needs with necessary investments to navigate a changing pharmacy and retail landscape," he added.

During the fiscal second quarter, Walgreens booked sales of $38.59 billion, up 4.1% from the same period a year ago, as sales grew in its U.S. retail pharmacy business and international segments. 

The company reported a net loss of $2.85 billion, or $3.30 per share, for the fiscal second quarter. It compares with a net loss of $5.91 billion, or $6.85 per share, in the year-earlier period.

Excluding certain items, adjusted earnings were 63 cents per share for the quarter.

The results include a $4.2 billion charge related to a loss in value of its U.S. retail pharmacy and investment in primary-care clinic chain VillageMD.

But Walgreens made $1 billion in profit by cashing out early on some of its shares of Cencora, a pharmaceutical solutions organization, and benefiting from gains from its investment in BrightSpring, a provider of comprehensive home and community-based health services. Those are two of Walgreens' top health-care investments. 

The company's operating cash flow in the second quarter was hit by $969 million in legal payments for opioid-related settlements and a dispute with virtual-care company Everly Health Solutions, which alleged that Walgreens broke the terms of a business contract during the Covid-19 pandemic.

President Donald Trump's tariff plan is making stock market history — and Wall Street is reeling.

The president's latest and most aggressive round of tariffs has fueled the worst market sell-off since 2020, leaving Wall Street on edge as concerns swirl over the economic impact of the tariffs and the growing possibility of a recession in 2025.

Stocks extended their losses on Monday, with all three benchmark indexes diving into the red and the S&P 500 briefly entering a bear market as Trump doubled down on his resolve to lower the trade deficit. Futures were trading higher on Tuesday.

Here's what Wall Street's top minds have been saying this week.

The US is likely already mired in a downturn — and stocks could plummet another 20% before they find a bottom, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said.

Fink, who spoke at an event at the Economic Club of New York on Monday, added that he was concerned there were more inflationary pressures on the economy than the market was pricing in.

Still, he said the sell-off in stocks looked like "more of a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity," adding that he didn't believe tariffs were creating systemic risks to the economy.

Economic chaos is likely if Trump doesn't pause or scale back tariffs immediately, the billionaire hedge funder Bill Ackman said Monday in a post on X.

Ackman, who endorsed Trump during the presidential race, urged the commander in chief to call off the tariffs for 90 days to allow the US and other countries to negotiate over trade policy.

"If, on the other hand, on April 9th we launch economic nuclear war on every country in the world, business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocketbooks, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate," the Pershing Square founder wrote.

In a separate post, Ackman said his firm wouldn't dump its US stock holdings even if tariff fears sparked a massive price drop.

"We will suffer mark-to-market losses if the market crashes, but we will not be sellers in a declining market," Ackman said, adding: "Over the long term, we are exposed to the health of our country and its economy. This is my only investment 'conflict' if you want to call it that."

The stock sell-off could get even worse, said Boaz Weinstein, a famed hedge funder and the founder of Saba Capital Management. That's because Trump's trade war could rattle the bond market and spark a wave of bankruptcies, he told Bloomberg TV.

"This is not going to get fixed tomorrow. I believe you cannot put the genie back in the bottle," Weinstein told the outlet in an interview published on Monday, pointing to reciprocal tariffs from China and other knock-on effects from Trump's tariff plan.

"The avalanche has really just started," he added. "The hit could be faster and the bankruptcy rate could spike much faster than other crises."

Weinstein said he saw a "real possibility" of the US entering a severe recession, pointing to how the Smoot-Hawley tariffs worsened the economic situation leading into the Great Depression.

"There might be something in between that stops the boulder, but I'm very concerned about a crash," he said.

In his annual letter to shareholders on Monday, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of the impact of tariffs, saying the steep duties on US imports could slow growth and raise inflation.

"The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession," the billionaire banker wrote.

Dimon also mentioned stagflation, a scenario where economic growth stagnates while inflation stays high. Economists say such an outcome, which plagued the US economy in the 1970s, would be even harder for policymakers to deal with than a recession, as inflationary pressures would prevent the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy.

"This tug-of-war can go on for some time, but it's good to remember that in the stagflation of the 1970s, recessions did not stop the inexorable trend of rising rates," he added.

Stanley Druckenmiller reiterated his stance against tariffs in an X post on Monday.

"I do not support tariffs exceeding 10% which I made abundantly clear in the interview you cite," the top investor wrote in response to another post, which featured a clip of a previous CNBC interview.

In the interview, Druckenmiller said he saw tariffs within "the 10% range" as the "lesser of two evils," adding that he believed that duties on US imports were "simply a consumption tax" partly paid for by foreign countries.

Trump's tariffs are having "very big impacts on markets and economies," but there should be more focus on what caused them and the even greater disruptions ahead, Ray Dalio said in a LinkedIn post on Monday.

"The far bigger, far more important thing to keep in mind is that we are seeing a classic breakdown of the major monetary, political, and geopolitical orders," he wrote, adding this kind of event only happened about once in a lifetime.

Dalio — the billionaire founder of Bridgewater Associates and the official mentor to the hedge fund's three co-chief investors — said unsustainable debt levels, gaping divides between people, and the end of US global dominance are behind the current disorder.

He also pointed to increasingly disruptive acts of nature and technological innovations such as AI as key drivers of the ongoing changes.

Trump went too far with his tariffs, leaving investors shellshocked and the economy in danger, Brad Gerstner, the founder and CEO of Altimeter Capital, told Fox Business on Monday.

Instead of precisely targeting import taxes at a few countries, the US "took out the bazooka," he said. "These are not reciprocal tariffs — this is a nuclear-style assault on global business and it's gonna land us in a recession."

The veteran tech investor said Trump needs to show Wall Street he wants fair tariffs and isn't "trying to unwind the entire global system of trade which has worked really well for America."

Gerstner added that "credit markets are beginning to crack, and when that happens, we're on the verge of throwing the US into a recession that you can't easily get out of." The US can't "just push a button and magically this all resets."

When voice authentication startup Pindrop Security posted a recent job opening, one candidate stood out from hundreds of others.

The applicant, a Russian coder named Ivan, seemed to have all the right qualifications for the senior engineering role. When he was interviewed over video last month, however, Pindrop's recruiter noticed that Ivan's facial expressions were slightly out of sync with his words.

That's because the candidate, whom the firm has since dubbed "Ivan X," was a scammer using deepfake software and other generative AI tools in a bid to get hired by the tech company, said Pindrop CEO and co-founder Vijay Balasubramaniyan.

"Gen AI has blurred the line between what it is to be human and what it means to be machine," Balasubramaniyan said. "What we're seeing is that individuals are using these fake identities and fake faces and fake voices to secure employment, even sometimes going so far as doing a face swap with another individual who shows up for the job."

Companies have long fought off attacks from hackers hoping to exploit vulnerabilities in their software, employees or vendors. Now, another threat has emerged: Job candidates who aren't who they say they are, wielding AI tools to fabricate photo IDs, generate employment histories and provide answers during interviews.

The rise of AI-generated profiles means that by 2028 globally 1 in 4 job candidates will be fake, according to research and advisory firm Gartner.

The risk to a company from bringing on a fake job seeker can vary, depending on the person's intentions. Once hired, the impostor can install malware to demand ransom from a company, or steal its customer data, trade secrets or funds, according to Balasubramaniyan. In many cases, the deceitful employees are simply collecting a salary that they wouldn't otherwise be able to, he said.

Cybersecurity and cryptocurrency firms have seen a recent surge in fake job seekers, industry experts told CNBC. As the companies are often hiring for remote roles, they present valuable targets for bad actors, these people said.

Ben Sesser, the CEO of BrightHire, said he first heard of the issue a year ago and that the number of fraudulent job candidates has "ramped up massively" this year. His company helps more than 300 corporate clients in finance, tech and health care assess prospective employees in video interviews.

"Humans are generally the weak link in cybersecurity, and the hiring process is an inherently human process with a lot of hand-offs and a lot of different people involved," Sesser said. "It's become a weak point that folks are trying to expose."

But the issue isn't confined to the tech industry. More than 300 U.S. firms inadvertently hired impostors with ties to North Korea for IT work, including a major national television network, a defense manufacturer, an automaker, and other Fortune 500 companies, the Justice Department alleged in May.

The workers used stolen American identities to apply for remote jobs and deployed remote networks and other techniques to mask their true locations, the DOJ said. They ultimately sent millions of dollars in wages to North Korea to help fund the nation's weapons program, the Justice Department alleged.

That case, involving a ring of alleged enablers including an American citizen, exposed a small part of what U.S. authorities have said is a sprawling overseas network of thousands of IT workers with North Korean ties. The DOJ has since filed more cases involving North Korean IT workers.

Fake job seekers aren't letting up, if the experience of Lili Infante, founder and chief executive of CAT Labs, is any indication. Her Florida-based startup sits at the intersection of cybersecurity and cryptocurrency, making it especially alluring to bad actors.

"Every time we list a job posting, we get 100 North Korean spies applying to it," Infante said. "When you look at their resumes, they look amazing; they use all the keywords for what we're looking for."

Infante said her firm leans on an identity-verification company to weed out fake candidates, part of an emerging sector that includes firms such as iDenfy, Jumio and Socure.

The fake employee industry has broadened beyond North Koreans in recent years to include criminal groups located in Russia, China, Malaysia and South Korea, according to Roger Grimes, a veteran computer security consultant.

Ironically, some of these fraudulent workers would be considered top performers at most companies, he said.

"Sometimes they'll do the role poorly, and then sometimes they perform it so well that I've actually had a few people tell me they were sorry they had to let them go," Grimes said.

His employer, the cybersecurity firm KnowBe4, said in October that it inadvertently hired a North Korean software engineer.

The worker used AI to alter a stock photo, combined with a valid but stolen U.S. identity, and got through background checks, including four video interviews, the firm said. He was only discovered after the company found suspicious activity coming from his account.

Despite the DOJ case and a few other publicized incidents, hiring managers at most companies are generally unaware of the risks of fake job candidates, according to BrightHire's Sesser.

"They're responsible for talent strategy and other important things, but being on the front lines of security has historically not been one of them," he said. "Folks think they're not experiencing it, but I think it's probably more likely that they're just not realizing that it's going on."

As the quality of deepfake technology improves, the issue will be harder to avoid, Sesser said.

As for "Ivan X," Pindrop's Balasubramaniyan said the startup used a new video authentication program it created to confirm he was a deepfake fraud.

While Ivan claimed to be located in western Ukraine, his IP address indicated he was actually from thousands of miles to the east, in a possible Russian military facility near the North Korean border, the company said.

Pindrop, backed by Andreessen Horowitz and Citi Ventures, was founded more than a decade ago to detect fraud in voice interactions, but may soon pivot to video authentication. Clients include some of the biggest U.S. banks, insurers and health companies.

"We are no longer able to trust our eyes and ears," Balasubramaniyan said. "Without technology, you're worse off than a monkey with a random coin toss."

As tariffs roil the U.S. economy, Walmart may find safety in a new part of its business that's driving more store traffic and online sales: its membership program, Walmart+.

Customers who belong to the subscription-based service accounted for nearly 50% of spending across Walmart's website and app in the U.S. in the most recent full fiscal year, which ended in late January, the company told CNBC. On average, Walmart+ members shop twice as much and spend nearly three times as much as Walmart customers who aren't subscribers.

The membership program's gains come at a helpful time for Walmart. The big-box retailer disappointed Wall Street with its outlook for the year ahead even before President Donald Trump announced tariffs on goods from around the world, sparking retaliation and fears of a global recession.

As the largest grocer in the U.S., the discounter has advantages in an economic downturn. Even so, Walmart+ could help insulate it from tariff turmoil, not only because it's a new source of revenue, but also because it helps to drive loyalty.

In an interview with CNBC, Chief Growth Officer Seth Dallaire described the program as a "frequency driver." He said Walmart has seen a rise in spending per subscriber and strong growth of sign-ups through Walmart+ Assist, a program that allows customers who qualify for government assistance to pay half price for membership.

He added that as Walmart+ grows, higher profits will allow Walmart to keep grocery prices low and invest in other areas to make it more competitive. The company can also use customer insights to pitch itself to advertisers — another growing, high-margin business for Walmart — and inform choices about the products it puts on shelves.

Walmart is expected to give an update on its retail business and other alternative revenue streams, such as the membership program and advertising, on Tuesday and Wednesday at an investor event in Dallas. The company, often seen as a barometer for consumer health in the U.S., could also give commentary on the state of the U.S. economy.

Walmart+, which launched almost five years ago, has become a loyalty play and one of the reasons why Walmart has been able to grow profits faster than sales. It offers perks including free shipping, free same-day grocery deliveries for orders of $35 or more, gas discounts and a Paramount+ subscription.

The membership program was Walmart's answer to Amazon Prime. It's just another page the retailer has taken from the playbook of Amazon, which surpassed Walmart in revenue for the first time in the fourth quarter.

Later this month, Walmart will look to build on member loyalty by using another tool deployed by Amazon. Starting April 28, it will throw Walmart+ Week, a special event with deeper deals on the program's existing perks like gas discounts and free sandwiches from Burger King.

Walmart+, which costs $98 annually or $12.95 per month, also explains in part why the discounter's e-commerce business has boomed. Walmart has posted 11 quarters in a row of double-digit online sales gains in the U.S., with 20% growth in the most recent quarter.

Walmart has not disclosed the number of Walmart+ subscribers. Market researcher Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates the program had about 25 million members as of the end of January, according to estimates based on quarterly consumer surveys and industry research. That's more than double its estimate of around 11 million to 11.5 million in the fall of 2022. 

Walmart+ has much less reach than Prime. Amazon's subscription service, which debuted in 2005, has an estimated 190 million members in the U.S., according to CIRP. Nearly three-quarters of Amazon's customer base reported having a Prime membership, according to CIRP surveys, compared with 43% of Walmart.com shoppers who reported having a Walmart+ membership.

Walmart+ is still winning over more customers, however. Three years ago, only 23% of Walmart.com shoppers reported having a Walmart+ membership.

Walmart's investor event this week will coincide with the expected start of steep tariffs on countries across the globe that have become major production hubs for the company and other retailers, including China, Vietnam and Cambodia. The tariffs are expected to start on Wednesday, after 10% levies took effect on Saturday.

Walmart gave its forecast for the full year in February, ahead of Trump's broad tariff expansion. In late February, the discounter said it expects full-year net sales to grow 3% to 4% and adjusted operating income to increase between 3.5% and 5.5% on a constant currency basis. That includes a 1.5 percentage point headwind from acquiring smart TV company Vizio and from having a leap year in 2024. The company said in February that it expects full-year adjusted earnings of $2.50 to $2.60 per share, which includes a 5 cent per share headwind from currency.

Escalating global trade conflicts have raised concerns that a recession may be looming. And consumers weren't feeling great even before Trump announced the new duties: consumer sentiment dropped in March to its lowest level since 2022, according to the University of Michigan's survey.

As retailers brace for the impact of tariffs, Walmart "is not immune," but should be better positioned, said Seth Sigman, a retail analyst at Barclays. As the nation's largest grocer, its business is steadier even if shoppers pull back on other kinds of spending, he said. As a giant company, it has greater ability to nudge suppliers to share higher costs and to absorb some of them. And as a well-known value retailer, it can gain sales if upper- and middle-income shoppers seek lower prices, he said.

Plus, he added, new moneymakers like membership have brought greater profitability and "a stickier customer."

Alana Martinson self-identifies as a "recession kid."

She was eight during the Great Recession in 2008 and remembers coming home from school, turning on the TV, and seeing advertisements focused on budgeting. Now 24 and working at a nonprofit in San Diego, she's nervous that she's about to relive the not-so-glory days of her youth after years of slowly mounting economic anxiety.

"We had four years of recession indicator panic," Martinson said, "and now it feels like it's actually happening."

With President Donald Trump's trade war in full swing, many see the probability of a downturn rising. Business Insider spoke to two boomers, a millennial, and two Gen Zers about what they're making of a possible economic slump.

Martinson, a Gen Zer, said she's always been frugal and isn't too nervous about losing her job, but she feels increased pressure to save money. She opened an IRA in college after watching her wealthier friends do so and contributes money to her 401(k), but she wishes she had saved more.

Michelle Husberg, 62, credits some of her previous recession luck to the saving habits she developed as a young person. A retired nurse, she and her husband never lost jobs or a house or impulsively withdrew all their money from the stock market.

"Keep a level head," she said. "Don't let all the noise around you — just keep doing what you're doing."

Husberg, a young boomer, was a kid during the 1970s recession and said the lessons she absorbed in childhood have buoyed her through the economic turndowns of adulthood.

"My parents were really good savers. They kind of instilled that in me," Husberg said. She's saved money since landing her first job at age 20 and called her dad, a firm believer in the stock market, as a young adult to figure out how much to contribute to her 401(k).

Between her husband's pension and Social Security, the two of them don't have to withdraw funds to cover their basic expenses. Most of their money has been invested in the stock market for decades; Husberg remembers watching her savings vanish seemingly overnight in 2001 and 2008. She's kept a spreadsheet of her savings since the 1990s, one which has dipped and risen alongside the markets.

"It is hard when you see the money go, especially when it drops in half," Husberg said of her investments. Her dad always said it would come back, though, and so far, he's been right, she said.

Gene Cain, a retired 71-year-old, wasn't so fortunate. In 2008, he was a middle manager at a furniture company and lost the money in his 401(k). Now, Cain relies on his Social Security check and lives month-to-month.

"Once we lost everything with the company I was working for, I never invested anything back," he said. "We just paid our bills and went on. I know it was a dumb thing to do, but it was what we had to do at the time."

Casandra King, a 37-year-old HR manager, said the shadow of 2008 has "impacted me greatly."

King, a millennial, graduated from college in 2010 and wasn't able to start saving then. She'd been worried about paying her bills since she was a junior during the Great Recession when she got a job working at Godiva Chocolates to stay afloat and crashed on friends' couches after losing her housing.

"We were lowballed from the moment we graduated, and so we've been fighting to make salaries that we deserve to make right out of school," she said of millennials.

Ava Hannah, a Gen Zer pursuing a nursing degree at the University of Central Arkansas, barely remembers previous recessions — she was three in 2008 and more focused on "TV and snacks" than market slides — but knows enough to be a little freaked.

"Maybe my dad has said the word recession once," the 19-year-old said, comparing the word to Voldemort's name. Hannah and her friends have talked about the possibility of a recession a bit, mainly over meals in the cafeteria.

"Usually it's full of jokes, because I don't know what's going to happen, but there's a real underlying element not of despair, but worry at least," she said. "I think a bunch of other kids on campus are also talking about it, because we're all college kids, we don't have money. It's just something that hangs over your head."

Husberg is mainly worried about how a recession could impact others, especially people in their 20s, and isn't changing her own habits much to prepare. After landing a new job recently, Martinson became a little looser with her spending but has since abandoned that mindset. She's started listening to news podcasts first thing each morning again, a habit she developed during the pandemic but later dropped.

"I'm nervous, and my body and brain are aware of this routine that another historical event is happening," she said.

King, the HR manager, is reexamining her family's spending — she and her husband have two kids — to cut out any waste, knowing that things might "seem really crappy for a long time."

At the same time, she doesn't think there's much she can do to prepare.

"We don't know what's going to come, so stressing about it — trying to save all this money, food, everything like that — it may help us, but it might not."

This is CNBC's live blog covering Asia-Pacific markets.

Asia-Pacific markets rose Tuesday, rebounding from previous session's losses over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policy and threats of even higher levies against China.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 2.27% to close at 7,510.

Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 6.03% to close at 33,012.58, while the Topix gained 6.26% to end the trading day at 2,432.02. South Korea's Kospi rose 0.26% to close at 2,334.23 and the small-cap Kosdaq added 1.1% to close at 658.45.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed over 1.51% to close at 20,127.68, while the Hang Seng Tech Index jumped 4.49%. Hong Kong's stock market led losses in the region on Monday, with the Hang Seng Index plummeting over 13% to log its steepest one-day decline since 1997, data from FactSet showed.

Mainland China's CSI 300 rose 1.71% to close at 3,650.76.

Trump on Monday threatened additional 50% tariffs on China if Beijing did not lift its duties on U.S. imports.

Indonesia's Jakarta Composite slid over 7.87% after trading resumed following a temporary circuit breaker. Vietnam's benchmark index lost 6.48% after coming back from a holiday. Thailand's benchmark SET fell to its lowest level since March 2020, data from LSEG showed.

Trump stuck to his aggressive global tariffs strategy over the weekend, with an initial unilateral 10% tariff going into effect Saturday. Wall Street had been hoping for signs of progress in negotiations between the U.S. and other countries, with the 'reciprocal' tariffs set to begin on April 9.

"Asian equities suffered their worst rout in years, plunging to multi-year lows in a day marked by panic and uncertainty," said Murthy Grandhi, company profiles analyst at data and analytics firm GlobalData.

"The renewed trade war fears have reignited concerns of a global economic slowdown, shattering already fragile investor confidence," he said, adding that the path forward hinges on policy clarity and diplomatic engagement.

U.S. stock futures rose after the S&P 500 extended its losses for a third day following Trump's tariffs announcement. Futures tied to the S&P 500 were about 1% higher, while Nasdaq-100 futures gained 1.1%. Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 476 points, or 1.2%.

Overnight in the U.S., the three major averages closed lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for a third day following President Donald Trump's tariff rollout, dropping 0.91% to close at 37,965.60.  The Nasdaq Composite inched higher by 0.10% to settle at 15,603.26. The S&P 500 shed 0.23% to end at 5,062.25. 

— CNBC's John Melloy, Hakyung Kim and Tanaya Macheel contributed to this report.



Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Tuesday warned of "disastrous" consequences for the world if trade disputes escalated. He was speaking at a parliamentary meeting.

"The U.S. may have decided to turn protectionist, but the rest of the world does not have to follow the same path," he said in a video posted by domestic media outlets. "We will forge closer links with likeminded partners who share our commitment to open and free trade." 

Singapore has a free trade agreement with the U.S., and imposes zero tariffs on U.S. goods, and runs a trade deficit with America. However, with the latest U.S. levies, Singapore goods will be subjected to 10% tariffs.

Wong expressed his disappointment with the U.S. move, citing the "deep and longstanding friendship" between the two countries.

The Straits Times Index was trading 1.7% lower on Tuesday.

The onshore Chinese yuan depreciated to trade at 7.3363 against the greenback on Tuesday, marking the lowest level since September 2023, data from LSEG showed.

While markets expect the yuan/dollar rate to breach 7.5 amid renewed tariff threats, such views may underestimate the PBOC's resolve — and ability — to stabilize the currency, said Dan Wang, China Director at Eurasia Group.

— Lee Ying Shan

Markets in Asia were oversold yesterday, said Stanley Tang, senior portfolio manager at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management. Asian equities are largely in the green after a steep sell-off in the previous session.

However, the rebound may be capped by a wait-and-see approach on the anticipated interest rate cuts by the Fed.

"Global recession is somewhat priced in after market correction in past few days, but we need a more accommodative monetary policy to fuel further rebound of equity market. Without this, rebound could be short lived," he told CNBC.

The current rebound for some APAC markets like Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Australia and NZ have some merit, said George Boubouras, managing director at K2 Asset Management.

"The extreme correction over the past week has led to some very compelling valuations for those to start to reallocate," he said.

It is a different narrative for other APAC markets like China however, noted Boubouras, who maintained an 'underweight' rating for Hong Kong and Chinese markets given they have the most to adjust from the proposed tariffs.

"Investors need to get comfortable being uncomfortable with the volatility ahead," he added.

—Lee Ying Shan

Indonesia's benchmark Jakarta Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 9.35%, resuming trading at 9.30am local time after a temporary circuit breaker was triggered.

The Indonesian Stock Exchange announced earlier that trading will be suspended for the rest of the day only if the market falls over 20%.

The Indonesian rupiah fell to a record low to trade at 16,850 against the greenback, data from LSEG showed.

—Lee Ying Shan

China's Commerce Ministry said it "resolutely opposes" U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of escalating tariffs, and vowed to take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests.

The comments came after Trump said he would impose an additional 50% duties on U.S. imports from China Wednesday, if Beijing does not withdraw the 34% tariff it imposed on American products last week.

"The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake," the statement said, according to a CNBC translation. "China will never accept it. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end."

Japan stocks jumped more 6% Tuesday, rebounding from the previous session's losses after U.S. President Trump said that he had spoken with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.

The benchmark Nikkei 225 surged 6.14%, while the Topix advanced more than 6.52%.

According to Trump, Japan is also dispatching a team to negotiate on trade, of which U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will be in charge of negotiating with, Reuters reported.

"Japanese equities are already at levels that indicate an economic downturn, but their ability to recover will probably not be as impressive as last summer," Nomura said in a note.

— Lee Ying Shan

Shares of Samsung Electronics were up about 3% in early trading at 54,500 Korean won ($37.08) after the South Korean technology giant said it forecasts better-than-expected profit for the first-quarter. 

According to an earnings guidance Tuesday, Samsung estimated its operating income for the first quarter to reach 6.6 trillion Korean won ($4.5 billion), beating estimates by economists polled by Reuters.

The operating profit guidance for the first quarter was down 0.2% from the same period last year. Meanwhile, first-quarter revenue is expected to have jumped 9.8% to approximately 79 trillion won. 

The results come as the company faces threats from the U.S. President Donald Trump's recently announced tariffs which could affect its semiconductor and smartphone businesses.

Aberdeen is keeping an eye on any areas for "bottom fishing" in the Asian equity markets amid increasing uncertainty. Bottom fishing is the practice of investing in financial assets that saw a significant decline in prices, and are often considered to be undervalued.

"We are watchful of opportunities for bottom fishing across Asian equity markets, although we are mindful of the growth exposures in our regional portfolios, and we are thinking through the potential winners and losers from the tariffs and any monetary policy adjustments that might follow," Aberdeen Investments' Deputy Head of APAC equities Pruksa Iamthongthong and her team told CNBC.

Looking ahead, Iamthongthong noted that Asian corporates still remain in "good shape" with low debt levels and strong competitive positions.

—Lee Ying Shan

U.S. oil prices fell about 2% on Monday, adding to last week's steep losses on fears President Donald Trump's global tariffs would push the U.S., and maybe the world, into a recession.

U.S .crude oil fell $1.29, or 2.08%, to close at $60.70 per barrel, while Brent lost $1.37, or 2.09%, to settle at $64.21. The latest price action comes after U.S. crude and Brent closed down more than 10% last week.

Futures tied to U.S. West Texas intermediate crude hit a session low of $58.95 per barrel, the lowest level since 2021. Global benchmark Brent fell to an intraday low of $62.51.

— Spencer Kimball

If President Donald Trump's tariffs push the U.S. economy into a recession, chip stocks could have at least another 20% to fall, according to Citi.

"We believe the biggest risk to the semi sector is a recession resulting from tariffs," Chris Danely, a managing director at the bank, wrote to clients in a recent note. "If the tariffs continue for another month, we believe is it highly likely the supply chain will 'freeze up' given uncertainty, drastically lower order rates/inventory, and result in lower guidance across the board – similar to Covid."

However, like during the Covid pandemic, Danely said investors can expect a "sharp rebound" once supply chains and tariff impacts become more stabilized and formulaic.

— Alex Harring

Market participants traded about 29 billion shares on Monday, resulting in the highest volume day in at least 18 years, according to FactSet and Nasdaq Trader.

It was a rocky day for stocks, with the S&P 500 briefly touching bear market territory and the Dow Jones Industrial Average seeing a swing of 2,595 points from its low to the high of the session.

Monday's volume surpassed Friday's volume of 26.77 billion shares, as well as the 10-day average volume of 16.94 billion shares.

— Gina Francolla, Darla Mercado

The meaning of the word "reciprocity" is being strained by the Trump administration. Not only did the White House use a bizarre formula to determine the degree of its "reciprocal" tariffs on other countries, but it also refused to return the favor when Vietnam and the European Union offered to remove tariffs on U.S. imports.

White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said on CNBC's "Squawk Box" that it's Vietnam's "nontariff cheating that matters," citing examples such as how Chinese goods are often exported from Vietnam and intellectual property theft. This suggests that the Trump administration sees tariffs not just as a means to address U.S. trade imbalance (which, itself, is already not a good indicator of economic health), but also a way of fundamentally changing the way global trade and manufacturing are being conducted.

Business leaders, many of them steering companies that rely on — and have profited from — the current economic paradigm, are starting to voice their concerns and even vent their displeasure at Trump tariffs. Some are supporters and donors of the Republican Party. With the Trump administration's idiosyncratic understanding of "reciprocity," however, it seems unlikely it will repay their goodwill with its own.

Nasdaq rises and Asian shares reboundU.S. markets mostly fell Monday. The S&P 500 lost 0.23% and was briefly in bear market territory — a 20% fall from its recent high — during the trading session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.91%, and swung 2,595 points from low to high, its largest intraday point swing ever recorded. But the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.1% as investors bought some megacap tech stocks — but Apple was bludgeoned again. Asia-Pacific markets climbed Tuesday, rebounding from heavy losses the previous day. Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped nearly 6% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 0.3%.

China pledges to 'fight to the end'U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to slap additional 50% tariffs on China — which would bring total duties on Chinese imports to 104% — after Beijing retaliated with its own levies of 34% on all U.S. goods. On Tuesday, China's Commerce Ministry said it "resolutely opposes" Trump's additional tariffs and vowed to "fight to the end," according to a statement translated by CNBC.

White House rejects 0% tariff dealsThat said, even if China had offered concessions to the United States, the Trump administration might not have budged. White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said Monday that an offer by Vietnam to eliminate tariffs on U.S. imports "means nothing to us because it's the nontariff cheating that matters." Trump also rejected the European Union's offer of "zero-for-zero" tariffs with the U.S. for industrial goods.

Growing fears and dissatisfactionBusiness leaders are sounding the alarm over the potential fallout from Trump tariffs. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said Monday that "Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now." JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, in his annual shareholder letter Monday, wrote that tariffs are likely to cause "inflationary outcomes" and "will slow down growth" of an "already weakening" economy. And Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone, a megadonor to the Republican Party, called the 46% import duties on Vietnam "bulls---."

[PRO] Waiting for 'sustained bottom'DoubleLine Capital CEO Jeffrey Gundlach said on CNBC's "Closing Bell" Monday that he's concerned over the lack of bounce in the market, and would hold cash until the S&P 500 hits a "sustained bottom." Here's where Gundlach thinks the S&P 500 could end up before it starts to rise again.   

European and Asian defense stocks have rallied this year. A lack of trust in the U.S. could be driving those gains

While stocks have generally sold off after U.S. President Donald Trump announced his plan for "reciprocal tariffs," European and Asian arms manufacturers are still posting respectable gains on a year-to-date basis, with some rising over 100%.

Veteran investor and strategist at Quantum Strategy David Roche told CNBC the rise in defense stocks outside of the U.S is due to the reduction in trust of the U.S. as an ally.

After the Trump administration's rattling of long-held global alliances, countries have poured money into their own defense budgets, sending defense stocks higher. In Germany, lawmakers passed a historic debt reform, paving the way for a huge splurge on defense. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has also pledged to hike Britain's national spending on defense.

Siena, ITALY — Monte dei Paschi di Siena is holding firm on its plans to acquire Mediobanca for 13 billion euros ($14.3 billion) despite ongoing market turbulence, telling CNBC it will complete the deal in July.

The world's oldest bank still in operation, surprised investors in January by making an all-share offer for Mediobanca, a prestigious institution focused on wealth management and investment banking. Mediobanca has rejected the proposal, denouncing it as a "destructive" move that is devoid of financial rationale.

Monte dei Paschi has faced several challenges over the years, most notably when it was bailed out by the Italian government in 2017 after it failed to raise much-needed cash from private investors. The Italian government has sold its majority stake in Monte dei Paschi and it currently represents less than 12% of ownership.

The bank's CEO Luigi Lovaglio told CNBC on Monday that Monte dei Paschi "is back" and "in control of our destiny."

When asked if the ongoing market turbulence could be a problem for its expansion plans, Lovaglio said: "The [market] situation will not impact our deal."

"On the opposite, [the market situation] is confirming that size matters, [it] is confirming that you need to diversify on revenues," he said, adding that if they were already a combined entity, they would "be stronger" and "have capability to react much quicker."

The recent market volatility has led some companies to put some deals on hold. British private equity firm 3i Group Plc has reportedly postponed a sale of the maker of pet food MPM, while fintech company Klarna has put its IPO plans on hold.

Analysts have been divided over the benefits of the deal between Monte dei Paschi and Mediobanca. Deutsche Bank, for instance, said in mid-March the market was ignoring some potential opportunities for Monte dei Paschi, including a bigger distribution policy.

Other analysts warned about limited synergies in combining two different banks. Barclays, for example, said Monday that it was cutting its price target for Monte dei Paschi, taking a more skeptical view on the potential gains from a deal with Mediobanca. "Should Monte dei Paschi decide to spend more to convince majority of the Mediobanca institutional shareholders, the excess capital could reduce," Barclays said.

Speaking to CNBC, Lovaglio was adamant the offer for Mediobanca presents a "fair price" and did not comment on whether the company would sweeten the deal to make it more appealing for Mediobanca shareholders.

"Hopefully within July, we can complete the deal," he added.

Amid a pullback in global equity markets on Monday, Monte dei Paschi and Mediobanca shares both closed around 5% lower. Since Monte dei Paschi announced its intention to buy Mediobanca on January 24, the latter's shares have lost about 14% of their value and the former about 8.5%.

Monte dei Paschi's offer for Mediobanca came at a time of wider consolidation efforts in Italian banking. UniCredit announced last year an offer to buy rival Banco BPM for about 10 billion euros.

Lovaglio said these bids represent the first wave of domestic consolidation for Italian banks.

"I believe this is the first phase [of consolidation] and, probably, we will have a second phase two years from now. That's why, by combining Monte [dei] Paschi with Mediobanca, we will be in a position to be again a protagonist," Lovaglio said.

Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, offered employees of one of the federal government's largest agencies a buyout on Monday evening, giving them a week to decide whether they wanted to leave the federal workforce.

The email — which resembles the "Fork in the Road" email sent to government employees — offered DHS employees the chance to take either a deferred resignation, an early retirement, or a lump-sum buyout of up to $25,000.

DHS is one of the largest departments in the federal government, with about 250,000 employees. It encompasses Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Secret Service, the Coast Guard, and other agencies. Noem said in a televised cabinet meeting in March that she planned to "eliminate FEMA."

In her email, Noem said the buyout offer generally wasn't being extended to law enforcement officials, which includes ICE agents.

"As a general rule, Law Enforcement Officials will be exempt from participation in these programs due to their essential mission-critical responsibilities," she wrote.

According to Noem's email, the lump sum policy would be considered severance pay.

It's not clear whether the offer would follow the Office of Personnel Management's severance pay formula for federal employees. Representatives for DHS did not answer questions about how the offer would work and how many employees received it.

"The American people deserve a government that works for them, something President Trump has promised." DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. "Every dollar spent and position filled at DHS should be focused on our core mission of securing our homeland and keeping the American people safe."

Employees have until April 14 to decide whether they want to take the offer, which was meant to "reflect our commitment to aligning our workforce with evolving mission needs," Noem wrote in the email, which had the subject line "Reshaping of the DHS workforce."

Reshaping of the DHS Workforce

Dear DHS Colleagues,

I am writing to share important news regarding new voluntary workforce transition programs approved for immediate implementation across the Department. These initiatives — collectively known as the Workforce Transition Program (WTP) —include the Deferred Resignation Program (DRP), the Voluntary Early Retirement Authority (VERA) and the Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment (VSIP). Together, they reflect our commitment to aligning our workforce with evolving mission needs while supporting the personal and professional goals of our dedicated employees. Components will provide guidance for which of these three programs are available to their respective workforce, to include populations who are excluded from our mission critical frontline workforce. As a general rule, Law Enforcement Officials will be exempt from participation in these programs due to their essential mission-critical responsibilities.

1. Deferred Resignation Program (DRP)

This program offers eligible employees a structured and supported path to transition from DHS. Those who choose to participate will receive a brief period of paid administrative leave to complete key tasks, submit retirement documentation, and prepare for departure. Most transitions under this program are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2025, though exact dates may vary depending on individual circumstances.

2. Voluntary Early Retirement Authority (VERA)

Under 5 U.S.C. S§ 8336(d)(2) (CSRS) and 8414(b)(1)(B) (FERS), VERA allows eligible employees who meet certain age and service requirements to retire early. This option helps employees who are ready to retire while ensuring DHS can address evolving needs across our Components.

3. Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment (VSIP)

Often referred to as a "buyout," this option offers a lump-sum payment of up to $25,000 (or an amount equal to severance pay if lower) for employees in roles slated for voluntary departures.

By offering these options, we intend to provide flexibility for employees who may be considering a change, retirement, or new career opportunities, while also supporting the Department's operational readiness. If you believe any or all of these programs might be right for you, please watch for further announcements from your Component leadership or Human Resources office, where you will find more specific eligibility criteria, detailed instructions, and timelines. Your decision to apply for any of these programs will be due NLT 11:59 ET on April 14, 2025.

Thank you for your continued dedication to the Department of Homeland Security and our nation's security. Your service and professionalism are greatly appreciated. If you have any questions in the meantime, please reach out to your HR office or supervisor for additional guidance.

				Taken from CNBC's Daily Open, our international markets newsletter — Subscribe today


The meaning of the word "reciprocity" is being strained by the Trump administration. Not only did the White House use a bizarre formula to determine the degree of its "reciprocal" tariffs on other countries, but it also refused to return the favor when Vietnam and the European Union offered to remove tariffs on U.S. imports.

White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said on CNBC's "Squawk Box" that it's Vietnam's "nontariff cheating that matters," citing examples such as how Chinese goods are often exported from Vietnam and intellectual property theft. This suggests that the Trump administration sees tariffs not just as a means to address U.S. trade imbalance (which, itself, is already not a good indicator of economic health), but also a way of fundamentally changing the way global trade and manufacturing are being conducted.

Business leaders, many of them steering companies that rely on — and have profited from — the current economic paradigm, are starting to voice their concerns and even vent their displeasure at Trump tariffs. Some are supporters and donors of the Republican Party. With the Trump administration's idiosyncratic understanding of "reciprocity," however, it seems unlikely it will repay their goodwill with its own.

U.S. stocks keep fallingU.S. markets mostly fell Monday. The S&P 500 lost 0.23% and was briefly in bear market territory — a 20% fall from its recent high — during the trading session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.91%, and swung 2,595 points from low to high, its largest intraday point swing ever recorded. But the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.1% as investors stepped in to buy some megacap tech stocks such as Nvidia and Amazon — but Apple got bludgeoned again.

EU leaders urge calm over market routThe pan-European Stoxx 600 index slumped 4.5% Monday, paring earlier losses of more than 6% and closing at a 14-month low. Last week, the Stoxx 600 index logged an 8.4% loss, marking its worst week in five years. European Union leaders urged calm over the heavy sell-off in markets, saying that regional unity and composure will be an asset in dealing with Trump tariffs. 

Trade war risks increase as U.S. rejects concessionsRisks of an intense U.S.-China trade war are rising rapidly after Beijing retaliated to Trump tariffs with levies of 34% on all U.S. goods, and Trump threatened to slap an additional 50% duty on China. White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said Monday that an offer by Vietnam to eliminate tariffs on U.S. imports "means nothing to us." Trump also rejected the European Union's offer of "zero-for-zero" tariffs with the U.S. for industrial goods.

Growing dissatisfaction and impatienceHome Depot co-founder Ken Langone, a megadonor to the Republican Party, called Trump's 46% import duties on Vietnam "bullshit" and said the 34% tariff rate on China was "too aggressive, too soon." Separately, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he was surprised by the "impatience" in the stock market since the tariff announcement because negotiations could go into June.

'Probably in a recession'Business leaders are sounding the alarm over a potential economic fallout from Trump tariffs. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said Monday that "Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now." JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, in his annual shareholder letter Monday, wrote that tariffs are likely to cause "inflationary outcomes" and "will slow down growth" of an "already weakening" economy.

[PRO] Waiting for 'sustained bottom'DoubleLine Capital CEO Jeffrey Gundlach said on CNBC's "Closing Bell" Monday that he's concerned over the lack of bounce in the market, and would hold cash until the S&P 500 hits a "sustained bottom." Here's where Gundlach thinks the S&P 500 could end up before it starts to rise again.   

Bond yields tank around the world as investors take cover amid equity rout

Global bond yields cratered in the wake of U.S. Donald Trump's tariff announcement last Wednesday, as investors hunt for any safe havens amid the stock market sell-off. 

The yield on Germany's 10-year bund — the benchmark for the euro area — had dropped from 2.72% on Wednesday to below 2.6% on Monday afternoon, though ticked higher to 2.65% at the end of the session.

Government borrowing costs have also tumbled in Asia. Japan's 10-year bond yield on Monday hit a three-month low, coming off its biggest weekly decline since 1998, according to economists at Deutsche Bank.

But economists warn the rally may not be sustainable if inflation concerns persist.

China's Commerce Ministry said it "resolutely opposes" U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of escalating tariffs, and vowed to take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests.

The comments came after Trump said he would impose an additional 50% duty on U.S. imports from China on Wednesday, if Beijing does not withdraw the 34% tariff it imposed on American products last week.

"The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake," the statement said, according to a CNBC translation. "China will never accept it. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end."

Last Friday, China's Finance Ministry announced 34% in additional tariffs on all goods imported from the U.S., starting April 10, in retaliation for Trump imposing new levies of 34% on China.

The across-the-board tariffs followed two previous rounds of 10%-15% tariffs, targeting mostly agricultural and energy products imported from the U.S. The broadened tariff scope reflects the Chinese leadership's diminished hopes for a trade deal with the U.S., said Gabriel Wildau, managing director at Teneo.

Trump's 34% tariffs on China were on top of the 20% duties rolled out since February, bringing the total new tariffs this year on China to 54%. The additional levies have lifted the U.S. weighted average tariff rate on China to as high as 65%, and could dent China's economy by 1.5 to 2 percentage points this year, according to Morgan Stanley.

"Since China already faces more than 60% in tariff rate, it doesn't really matter if it goes up by 50% or 500%," said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, suggesting Beijing is prepared for a "full on" trade war with the U.S.

"China is on the defensive side, but basically the two sides are testing each other's limit," Xu said.

As risks of an intense U.S.-China trade war rise, Beijing might resort to further retaliatory measures, such as stopping purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, matching U.S. tariffs, and further expansion of export controls on metals and minerals, Xu added.

Beijing has already placed export curbs on key rare earth elements, prohibited exports of dual-use items to a dozen of U.S. entities, and added U.S. firms to its "unreliable entities list," subjecting them to broader restrictions while operating in China.

The People's Bank of China on Tuesday set the midpoint rate for onshore yuan at 7.2038 per dollar, the weakest level since September 2023, according to data provider Wind Information. The yuan is allowed to trade within a 2% band of this midpoint rate.

The yuan's weakening is a "big signal," Robin Brooks, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia," "this is Beijing politely saying this is getting a little too much, we are putting you on notice, we can devalue if we want and bigger things may come if you keep this up."

"This is a clear shot across the bow of Washington," Brooks added.

Chinese onshore yuan weakened as much as 0.39% to 7.3363 per dollar, while the offshore yuan was little changed.

Trump has shown few signs of backing down on tariffs despite the mounting pressure in the financial markets and signs of frustration even among his allies. In a post on social media platform Truth Social on Monday, the president said, "all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!"

U.S. State Department did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

"Escalation is probably the only short-term outcome, but negotiations will ultimately come as both sides feel the pinch of the economic slowdown," Xu said.

At a regular news conference on Tuesday, Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said Beijing would take "necessary measures" against U.S. tariff threats, according to a CNBC translation of reports in Chinese state media.

He reiterated the Commerce Ministry's statement, "If U.S. insists on waging a tariff war, a trade war, China will fight till the end."

Acting chairman Travis Hill emphasized the agency's interest in addressing stablecoin-related matters and tokenized deposits.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is formalizing a more permissive and transparent framework for US banks engaging with crypto, including the use of public, permissionless blockchains.

In remarks delivered at the American Bankers Association Washington Summit on April 8, FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill addressed the agency's evolving stance on crypto-related activities.

One key area under review involves the interaction between regulated banks and public, permissionless blockchains. 

Hill acknowledged that while jurisdictions outside the US have permitted banks to use public chains for several years, US banking regulators have maintained a significantly more cautious posture.

The FDIC now considers a total prohibition on public blockchain use too restrictive. However, Hill stressed the need for appropriate guardrails to govern such activity.

The agency is evaluating existing interagency guidance, including the joint statements issued in January and February 2023, to develop durable standards for the responsible use of public networks.

The question of whether public chains can operate in a permissioned mode is also considered. According to Hill, regulators must assess how to define and supervise blockchain configurations that blur the line between open and permissioned environments.

The FDIC said it intends to release additional guidance addressing specific digital asset use cases.

 According to Hill, the agency continues to assess open questions related to the scope of permissible crypto-related activities, the supervisory treatment of blockchain-based products, and the risk management expectations for banks operating in this space.

The broader objective is to establish a consistent and transparent supervisory framework that enables innovation while ensuring adherence to safety and soundness standards. 

Hill recently noted that the agency's revised guidance represents a foundational shift in how to treat crypto and blockchain technologies within the US banking system.

He emphasized that the FDIC rescinded its previous requirement for supervised institutions to notify the agency before engaging in digital asset and blockchain activities.

Hill also addressed emerging questions surrounding stablecoins, particularly regarding legislative moves by Congress. 

The FDIC examines potential pass-through deposit insurance regulations updates to clarify eligibility requirements for stablecoin reserve deposits. Key issues under evaluation include liquidity risk management, safeguards against illicit finance, and cybersecurity standards.

In 2020 and 2021, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) deemed several crypto-related services permissible for national banks, such as stablecoin custody and issuance, participation as blockchain validator nodes, and the acceptance of stablecoin-related deposits. 

The FDIC is now considering whether to further define the boundaries of permissible activities in this area or expand the regulatory guidance to include additional use cases.

The speech also highlighted the need for clearer regulatory treatment of tokenized real-world assets and liabilities, including tokenized commercial bank deposits. Hill said the FDIC believes that “deposits are deposits, regardless of the technology or recordkeeping deployed.” 

However, he raised concerns about counterparties' ability to withdraw funds at par using smart contracts after a bank failure, which could increase resolution costs if safeguards are not in place to halt such flows.

This concern is driving internal FDIC efforts to assess technical solutions that could prevent unintended fund outflows during bank resolution scenarios. 

Hill noted that the challenge lies in aligning on-chain programmability with traditional regulatory protections designed to ensure the orderly winding down of failed institutions.

The FDIC's changes mark a formal move toward regulatory clarity for banks exploring digital asset infrastructure while emphasizing the need for prudent risk controls and further definitional work around permissible activities.

SINGAPORE, April  08, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WEEX , a global digital asset trading platform, officially listed the AB/USDT trading pair on April 2, 2025.

AB is a public blockchain infrastructure project committed to building a decentralized future. It provides efficient and secure foundational support for DApps and a wide range of digital assets. Its high-performance mainnet and cross-chain capabilities are key to enabling the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). The project currently focuses on practical scenarios including DeFi, IoT, and enterprise services. Originally launched as Newton, AB completed its rebranding in February 2025, marking a strategic shift from early community economy exploration toward a new phase of blockchain infrastructure evolution.

Real-world assets are rapidly becoming a key narrative within the global on-chain ecosystem. In late 2024, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenized U.S. Treasury product, which has since become the largest of its kind by market capitalization. In early 2025, Circle announced the acquisition of RWA platform Hashnote and integrated it with its USDC-linked fund products, further advancing the convergence between stablecoins and real-world financial instruments. These developments reflect the accelerating global interest in on-chain RWAs. According to data from RWA.xyz, as of March 2025, the total value of RWAs locked on-chain has surpassed $18.6 billion, up nearly 20% since the beginning of the year.

The listing of AB represents another strategic step in WEEX's commitment to blockchain infrastructure development. The platform continues to focus on supporting high-quality projects that facilitate the tokenization of real-world assets and enable cross-chain interoperability. AB's long-term dedication to RWA use cases and its adoption of heterogeneous blockchain architecture align closely with WEEX's mission to bridge real-world value and on-chain participation, offering users broader access to diversified digital assets.
		



To mark the listing, WEEX has launched a limited-time deposit and spot trading promotion. Users who complete the designated tasks will be eligible to share in a total prize pool of 10,000 USDT.

 Bitcoin heads toward new lows after the White House confirms 104% tariffs against China, but traders say BTC still trades in a “fair gap zone.” 

Bitcoin's surprise rebound to $81,180 — which was influenced by fake news regarding a pause on US tariffs — has all but evaporated following White House confirmation that 104% tariffs on China will start on April 9.

After dropping below the $75,000 level for the first time since Nov. 6, 2024, BTC retested a key demand zone that traders hope will provide a safe haven for the bulls.

The safe haven is a fair value gap located between $77,000 and $73,400, and this zone was created during the November 2024 Trump pump.

MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe had earlier asserted that Bitcoin needed to retest this zone “before going back upward.”

“Bitcoin attacking $80,000 is a strong sign,” said van de Poppe in another X post on April 8, adding:

Fellow analyst Jelle shared similar sentiments, saying that Bitcoin's close above $79,000 on April 7 after dropping as low as $74,400 was impressive compared to how equities performed.

Data from onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant now shows that the long-term holders (LTHs) — individuals and entities who have held Bitcoin for more than 155 days — could be preparing to sell their coins, particularly after the latest crash.

The Exchange Inflow Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric measures the volume of Bitcoin moved to exchanges, weighted by how long those coins were held dormant, indicating potential selling pressure from long-term holders.

There was a massive spike in this metric on April 7, signaling that the old coins are waking up, which is historically a bearish sign. 

A chart posted by a CryptoQuant contributor, IT Tech, in one of its “Quicktake” blog posts showed that when the metric spiked on April 2, Bitcoin price dropped from $88,000 to $81,000.

A similar spike was seen on March 27, preceding a 7% drop in price over two days.

Spotting a similar spike on April 7, the analyst wondered if Bitcoin's long-term holders were “preparing to sell again?”

If history repeats itself, Bitcoin's sell-off could continue for a few more days, with the March 2024 all-time high near $74,000 presenting the first line of defense.

"Hi Curly, kill anyone today," said Billy Crystal's Mitch to Jack Palance's Curly in City Slickers. "Day ain't over yet," replied Curly.

Bernstein, though, is ready to call it a day, saying bitcoin's (BTC) being down just 26% from its record high of less than three months ago shows resilience.

Previous crises, such as the Covid-19 epidemic and interest rate shocks, saw the world's largest cryptocurrency "fall of the cliff" with 50-70% drawdowns, the report noted.

The price action "suggests demand from more resilient capital," the analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.

"Bitcoin's digital gold thesis has strengthened driven by growing institutional adoption - institutional flows via ETFs and corporate treasuries," the authors wrote.

Still, tariffs are bad news for the miners. 

They impact the mining supply chain, and this has negative implications for the U.S. bitcoin miners' hashrate, Bernstein said. The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty.

Large bitcoin miners, such as Riot Platforms (RIOT), IREN (IREN), MARA Holdings (MARA) and CleanSpark (CLSK), could gain market share as they are already scaled and have artificial intelligence (AI) optionality, the report added.

AI cybersecurity startup Octane has emerged from stealth and announced it secured $6.75 million in a seed funding round.

Octane will use the funding to accelerate the development of its platform that uses machine learning to continuously analyze blockchain codebases, identify vulnerabilities and remediate them before they can be exploited, the company said in a Tuesday (April 8) press release.

“Flawed blockchain code enables billions in theft across crypto, with vulnerable smart contracts creating an ever-expanding attack surface as more value enters the ecosystem,” Octane CEO Giovanni Vignone said in the release.

Octane's platform helps developers catch bugs before deployment and throughout the software development cycle, according to the release. It will soon offer code analysis for off-chain codebases as well.

The company's seed funding round was co-led by Archetype and Winklevoss Capital, per the release.

“Securing smart contracts on the blockchain is one of the biggest challenges facing any crypto developer,” Tyler Winklevoss said in the release. “Octane allows devs to battle-test their smart contract code with AI-powered security testing before it hits production on the blockchain. This is huge for devs, companies and mainstream crypto adoption.”

A growing share of chief operating officers at organizations that generate more than $1 billion in annual revenue have implemented AI-powered automated cybersecurity management systems, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report, “COOs Leverage GenAI to Reduce Data Security Losses.”

The report found that the share of these COOs who said their companies have implemented these systems leapt from about 17% in May to 55% in August.

This growth has been driven by COOs' demand for GenAI-driven solutions to improve cybersecurity management at a time when companies face the threat of cyberattacks that are growing more sophisticated, according to the report.

Dream, a company focused on AI-powered cybersecurity for nations and critical infrastructure, said in February that it raised $100 million in a Series B funding round to expand into additional markets in which cyber threats pose challenges to national security.

In September, Torq raised $70 million in a Series C funding round to expand its AI-first cybersecurity hyperautomation solutions that automate, manage and monitor critical security operations center (SOC) responses.

Although XRP has yet to see a major price rally following Ripple's acquisition of Hidden Road, market sentiment remains optimistic about its potential to climb higher. On Tuesday, Ripple agreed to acquire prime brokerage firm Hidden Road for $1.25 billion. 

The deal now positions Ripple to act as a rare crypto-native bridge into the traditionally exclusive world of global finance, an effort that now hinges on the XRP Ledger, Ripple's stablecoin RLUSD, and growing interest in real-world asset tokenization.

A Bridge Between Blockchain and Wall Street

With this, Ripple becomes the first crypto-focused company to own a fully operational prime broker active in both traditional and digital markets.

The short-term impact of the acquisition plan is yet to be felt in the price of XRP, which could be attributed to the bear market caused by Trump's tariff imposition. At the time of publication, XRP traded at $1.88, down 12% in the weekly chart, according to CoinMarketCap. 

Ripple intends to integrate its enterprise-grade stablecoin, RLUSD, into this infrastructure to serve as cross-margin collateral. This will allow institutional clients to manage positions across both crypto and traditional instruments seamlessly.

Ripple's plan includes deploying the XRP Ledger to handle portions of trade settlements. Currently, such trades can take up to 24 hours via fiat rails. Ripple aims to shrink that window to minutes.

Market Impact and Outlook

 Last year, Ripple partnered with UK-based Archax to launch a tokenized money market fund on XRPL. Now, with Hidden Road's client base and infrastructure, Ripple could broaden XRPL's role in tokenizing everything from bonds to commodities.

Standard Chartered sees Ripple as well-positioned in this shift. The bank's latest report forecasts XRP could hit $12.50 by 2028, citing its central role in cross-border payments and expected demand for regulated digital asset solutions. XRP is currently trading near $1.93, up over 7% following the announcement.

Ripple's move comes amid growing signs that regulatory conditions in the U.S. may favor tokenization and digital asset adoption. 

By merging crypto-native infrastructure with established capital market workflows, Ripple is not just expanding its service offering, it's laying the groundwork for a new phase in institutional finance. If successful, the Hidden Road acquisition could cement XRPL as a backbone for a tokenized, blockchain-compatible financial system.

Key Takeaways:

Binance has announced that it will delist 14 altcoins following the results of its first-ever “Vote to Delist” program. As of April 16, 2025 at 03:00 UTC, all spot trading pairs involving these tokens (BADGER, BAL, BETA, CREAM, CTXC, ELF, FIRO, HARD, NULS, PROS, SNT, TROY, UFT, and VIDT) will be removed.

The exchange said it conducted extensive due diligence, considering factors including:

Although the community vote carried significant weight, Binance noted that delisting decisions are on multiple layers. So in practice, a token could be delisted even if it didn't come in lowest in the vote tally, and vice versa.

The “Vote to Delist” received 103,942 total votes from 24,141 users but saw 10,262 votes disqualified by Binance for fraudulent activity, bot abuse or other methods that do not comply with BNB holding criteria. After this filtering, there remained 93,680 authenticated votes deemed valid.

Binance validated participation through two methods:

Tokens such as TROY, SNT, and UFT received the highest eligible votes across both methods but were all listed for delisting. The outcome raised eyebrows in some quarters of the crypto community, with some users speculating that the vote might have been more symbolic than decisive. Others expressed concerns about potential bias against BSC-based tokens — a critique that Binance has not directly addressed.



A timetable for how the exchange is winding down support throughout its ecosystem has been detailed by Binance. Here are the main service impacts:

Binance has also issued a strong warning to users, advising them to cancel bots, close positions, and avoid last-minute trades to limit exposure from forced liquidations or unplanned conversions.

The market response was immediate and savage. Some of these 14 altcoins jumped off a cliff, the rest showing similar profiles to those during previous waves of delisting. In February 2025, AKRO, BLZ and WRX were delisted by Binance, losing over 20% within 24h.

This reaction was particularly painful for BADGER and CREAM, which fell more than 15% each within hours of the news. The price floors for these altcoins disappeared due to low liquidity and low buy support. Binance's dominant role in trading volume for many of these tokens magnifies the damage. When it is delisted on the leading stage, investor confidence disappears, in many cases permanently.

The community-led (although arguably official) delisting by Binance was hailed as a step toward decentralization, but its critics now perceive it as more public relations than real change. Skeptics say popularity should not trump project fundamentals, particularly when vote manipulation is a possibility. There's also the fear that solid, but swinging, tokens may be unfairly punished. Binance warned that passing the vote doesn't guarantee safety. Projects may still face delisting if they fail to meet evolving standards. No date has been set for the next ‘Vote to Delist,' but the precedent is clear.

Sequence has acquired the tech firm Light and is sunsetting Horizon, but Skyweaver remains live

Sequence, modified by Blockworks

This is a segment from The Drop newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe.

Crypto gaming infrastructure firm Sequence — which also owns Horizon Blockchain Games — is shutting down its Horizon brand. 

Horizon Blockchain Games is no more. Existing resources and products under that brand, including its flagship 2019 game Skyweaver, will now exist solely under the Sequence brand, Sequence shared exclusively with The Drop and Blockworks. 

“This name change is a commitment to clarity — and our mission to unify blockchain ecosystems and empower builders across Web3,” said Peter Kieltyka, cofounder and CEO at Sequence, in a statement.

The move also finalizes Sequence's pivot away from game development as it allocates more of its resources to building crypto infrastructure.

“Skyweaver still has a community,” Sequence cofounder and Chief Storyteller Michael Sanders told Blockworks in an interview, noting that the game remains playable. 

“A lot of the inspiration for Skyweaver was to understand how to build a developer platform, right? Like, to understand the pain points that players are dealing with, that game developers are dealing with, regarding things like accounts and payments and wallets and transactions and marketplaces and, you know, all of that,” Sanders said, adding: “Skyweaver really taught us what's required in a development platform.”

Horizon Blockchain Games raised a $40 million Series A in 2022. It had also raised another $13.3 million across three prior seed funding rounds, per Crunchbase data.

Sequence also said it's acquired Light, a crypto tech firm focused on tackling the Ethereum “chain abstraction” challenge. Because there are so many Ethereum L2 and even “L3” blockchains — as well as “sidechains” and other separate EVM-compatible L1 chains — it can be difficult for non-technical or new users in crypto to navigate the space without encountering hiccups, roadblocks, glitches, delays or other problems.

The goal of chain abstraction is to make as much of the technical side of a multichain experience happen under the hood, so that users don't have to do things like manually bridge tokens, pay to “wrap” tokens, “sign” with a wallet frequently, or face delays when trying to complete transactions.

“Developers need access to all of Ethereum and its buying power, and users want

intuitive and seamless experiences. That's the Web3 we're building—fast, accessible, and seamlessly interoperable,” said Light founder Shun Kakinoki in a statement. 

Kakinoki is now Sequence's head of cross-chain post-acquisition.

Sequence provides infrastructure for some of the biggest players in the crypto gaming space, typically offering those services as “white-label.” That means you don't see their name on a product that they provided to another brand. Instead, the wallet or feature shows the client's branding.

For instance, crypto gaming platform Immutable uses Sequence's embedded wallets. Sequence also counts Ubisoft, Polygon, SKALE, Avalanche and Base among its clients.

Sequence also offers an in-app payment system via Sequence Pay. The firm has its own indexer so game devs can assess activity across multiple chains. It also offers analytics and a marketplace API, and it allows devs to cover gas fees for user transactions.

Sequence's investors include Brevan Howard Digital, Coinbase, Initialized Capital, Bitkraft, Polychain, Morgan Creek Digital, Polygon and Ubisoft.

Utilizing a ‘DeFi Mullet' approach, Coinbase's Bitcoin-backed loans integration with Morpho demonstrates a powerful blueprint for CEXs to monetize dormant assets by expanding adoption of wrapped products (cbBTC, USDC) while also supporting native and/or preferred DeFi ecosystems (Base) which can further lead to downstream growth in onchain liquidity and increased utilization of the related assets.

XRP could surge to $12.5 and overtake Ethereum as the second-largest crypto asset by market cap before Trump's second term wraps up, according to a new report by Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered's global head of digital assets research.

With XRP now trading at $1.9 according to CoinGecko data, reaching $12.5 would represent a surge of over 550%.

“By the end of 2028, we see XRP's market cap overtaking Ethereum's,” Kendrick noted.

XRP's market cap is over $110 billion per CoinGecko, positioning it as the fourth-largest crypto asset. This places it behind Bitcoin, Ether, and Tether. Currently, Ether's market cap sits at around $183 billion.

XRP's market cap previously peaked at $190 billion in January, and it has also, at times, surpassed Tether to claim the third-ranking spot.

Kendrick's forecast is based on several factors, including expected regulatory developments and institutional adoption. According to the analyst, a key positive catalyst for XRP's price growth is the recent resolution between Ripple and the SEC.

Last month, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that the securities regulator had dropped its lawsuit against the blockchain company. Ripple has agreed to pay $50 million as part of the settlement, which does not require the firm to admit to any wrongdoing.

The SEC's decision reflects a shift in regulatory approach under the current administration. Prior to Ripple, the agency had already withdrawn from several high-profile crypto enforcement cases.

Kendrick also forecasts SEC approval for spot XRP ETFs in the third quarter of 2025, which he estimates could attract $4-8 billion in inflows within the first year. This projection falls in line with JPMorgan's estimate.

The bank, in its January analysis, also anticipated first-year inflows for potential XRP spot ETFs to be in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion. JPMorgan's forecast was based on the market penetration rates observed with existing Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.

Ripple's CEO previously predicted XRP ETFs would make their market debut in the second half of 2025.

Regarding XRP's use case in payments, Kendrick believes its cross-border payment functionality aligns with growing digital asset usage trends, similar to stablecoins, which he notes have seen 50% annual transaction volume growth and are projected to increase tenfold over four years.

Kendrick believes the XRP Ledger (XRPL), XRP's foundational blockchain, functions as a “payments chain” with a strong trajectory to become a “tokenization chain.”

In support of this view, the analyst compares XRPL to Stellar, a blockchain with comparable architecture that has achieved success in tokenization. Franklin Templeton initially launched its OnChain US Government Money Fund on Stellar.

Kendrick projects XRP to reach $5.5 by year-end, rising to $8 in 2026, and hitting $12.5 in 2028. These projections are based on the assumption that Bitcoin will reach $500,000 within the same timeframe.

Even though the analyst is bullish on XRP, he does not ignore existing challenges the project faces, including a smaller developer ecosystem than its competitors and a low fee model.

Still, he believes that the positive drivers he has outlined could overpower these barriers.

The analyst continues to see strong potential in Bitcoin and Avalanche, but he's less enthusiastic about Ether, labeling it an “identified loser.”

 Bitcoin finds stability as US stocks bounce back, and the longer-term outlook improves as traders anticipate China's yuan devaluation move to benefit BTC price. 

Bitcoin (BTC) danced around $80,000 at the April 8 Wall Street open as US stock markets staged a fresh recovery, but unresolved tensions between China and the US continue to put a damper on BTC's upside.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC price volatility cooling while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index gained up to 4.3% in the first few hours of trading.

Stocks built on a strong rebound that had accompanied the start of the week's TradFi trading, alleviating fears of a 1987 “Black Monday” style crash. 

US trade tariffs nonetheless stayed top of the agenda for traders, who in particular eyed the ongoing war of words with China.

In a post on Truth Social, US President Donald Trump claimed that Beijing “wants to make a deal, badly, but they don't know how to get it started.”

“We are waiting for their call,” he told readers.

Bitcoin advocates eyed the devaluation of the yuan as part of China's tariff response and the potential inflows to hedges such as BTC as a result.

“Xi's major weapon is independent monetary policy which necessitates a weaker yuan,” Arthur Hayes, ex-CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, wrote in part of X coverage of the topic.

Hayes suggested that either the People's Bank of China (PBoC) or the US Federal Reserve would ultimately provide the fuel for a BTC price rally.

“If not the Fed then the PBOC will give us the yachtzee ingredients,” he argued in his characteristic style.

The Fed, meanwhile, could boost Bitcoin and risk assets by lowering interest rates to stimulate growth. In a blog post on the day, AllianceBernstein predicted this happening even as tariffs added to inflationary pressures.

“If the economy slows, as we expect it will, the Fed will be inclined to cut rates even if price levels are high,” Eric Winograd, the firm's Developed Market Economic Research director wrote.

Winograd said that AllianceBernstein expected 75 basis points of rate cuts in 2025, with the latest data from CME Group's FedWatch Tool showing markets betting on the first of these coming at the Fed's June meeting.

Considering the global market tumult of the last three days, Bitcoin's price action has remained eerily cool on the shorter timeframes as snap price moves gave way to consolidation.

For traders, among the key levels to watch was the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, currently near $73,500.

“In a bull market, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement acts as key support,” popular trader Titan of Crypto explained, describing BTC/USD as “in a reversal zone.”

Fellow trader Daan Crypto Trades also underscored the level's potential significance, with it coinciding with old all-time highs from March 2024.

“$BTC Has respected its .382 Fibonacci retracements, measured from the cycle bottom to the local tops, quite well so far,” he told X followers. 

Other important trend lines, as Cointelegraph reported, include the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), a classic bull market support line that was lost when BTC first fell below $82,000.

It's bittersweet to think back to the days of the early NFT boom. We were still in the thick of COVID-19 caution but slowly coming out of quarantine when TikTok and Tiger King monopolized the collective consciousness. Then comes NFTs, a revolutionary form of digital art that initially seemed like a fad but ended up becoming a cultural disruptor. In the new documentary Minted: The Rise (and Fall?) of the NFT, filmmaker Nicholas Bruckman charts the wild ride of the art world's former darling.

An artist named Beeple sits in his living room surrounded by loved ones as they all stare at his TV in disbelief. Beeple's newly created NFT has sold for $69 million. This digital artwork, which is still in the infancy stage of popularity, has officially made Beeple the third highest-selling artist of all time. But what exactly is an NFT, and why are people spending thousands, if not millions, of dollars on art that can literally be saved on a computer for free? This is Bruckman's starting point as he navigates the curiously bizarre trajectory of the NFT.

Watch the Minted: The Rise (and Fall?) of the NFT trailer here.

Bruckman does a great job of getting into the minds of these digital pioneers whose lives have changed forever by selling their art on the blockchain. After Beeple's historic sale ignited an all-out frenzy, many artists found themselves living out their own rags-to-riches stories. But all good things must come to an end. Minted goes into stunning detail about the conspiracy theories, celebrity endorsements, and dark side of this controversial new frontier.

Watching this film in hindsight, as the stock market is currently volatile, gives off an eerily uneasy feeling. Nicholas Bruckman could have never predicted the timing of this release to perfectly align with cultural events but it works so well in tandem. It forces the audience to question not just the monetary value of an NFT, but the very nature of art. This larger philosophical question is juxtaposed against composer Dan Deacon's bright and forceful score.

The question remains: Are NFTs dead? Minted hypothesizes that they may not be raking in millions of dollars like they used to, but there is still a market for them. However, what has died are people's hopes and dreams that this was sustainable. Minted made its World Premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival and is coming to Netflix on April 9th.

Digital asset trust bank Anchorage Digital will safeguard some of the Bitcoin and Ethereum held by BlackRock's exchange-traded funds, according to two Securities and Exchange Commission filings submitted on Tuesday.

A digital asset trust bank is like a regular bank, but it's allowed to hold cryptocurrencies on behalf of clients, while Anchorage also specializes in staking, trading, and governance.

The world's largest asset manager may use several custody accounts at the San Francisco-based bank to maintain funds for its $45 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, or IBIT, and $1.8 billion iShares Ethereum Trust ETF, or ETHA, BlackRock stated in the filings.

Anchorage's arrangement with BlackRock underscores the asset manager's “ongoing risk management approach” and “expanding presence in the digital asset space,” BlackRock stated.

BlackRock had already tapped crypto exchange Coinbase as a custodian for its two crypto funds, alongside several other asset managers that launched new products for the industry's two largest cryptocurrencies by market value last year.

“We are excited by the opportunity to set a new standard for tailored access to the digital asset class,” Anchorage co-founder and CEO Nathan McCauley said in a statement. “We are helping BlackRock to meet client demand for today and tomorrow.”

So far, Coinbase has been dominant in securing billions of dollars' worth of digital assets for the Wall Street products. Asset manager VanEck custodies its Bitcoin ETF with crypto exchange Gemini, while financial titan Fidelity self-custodies the BTC backing its Bitcoin fund.

Anchorage entered into a custody arrangement with crypto asset manager 21Shares in September, safeguarding funds for its spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. 

The digital asset trust bank also began supporting tokens on layer-1 network Aptos, including BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), in December.

BlackRock's custodial arrangement with Coinbase will not be affected by the firm's new deal with Anchorage, which received its federal charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in January 2021, the asset manager said.

BlackRock isn't planning on moving funds to Anchorage from Coinbase, but it can decide how funds are split between the two firms at its “sole discretion,” the asset manager stated.

PARIS, April  08, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Paris Blockchain Week (PBW) 2025 officially opened today at the Carrousel du Louvre, drawing global attention as Europe's most influential gathering for blockchain and Web3 innovation. As an official sponsor, BYDFi marked its fifth anniversary with a major reveal—debuting its brand-new on-chain trading platform, MoonX, for the first time on an international stage.

With more than 10,000 attendees on site—including industry leaders, developers, and innovators—PBW's opening day buzzed with energy. BYDFi's booth (#44) quickly became one of the hottest spots, with a steady stream of visitors exploring the future of Web3 trading. The timing couldn't have been more fitting: MoonX's unveiling aligned perfectly with BYDFi's five-year milestone, adding an extra layer of significance to the launch.



“Crypto Travel Challenge” Sparks Global Excitement

To celebrate its anniversary and kick off PBW with energy, BYDFi launched its “Crypto Travel Challenge”—a hybrid online-offline campaign inspired by the brand's five-year journey. On site, attendees scanned QR codes at the booth to complete missions and claim exclusive “Crypto Voyager Backpacks” and limited-edition BYDFi merch. The prize line stretched long, as excitement spread throughout the venue.

Meanwhile, online participants joined from around the world by following BYDFi's official X account (@BYDFi_Official), reposting the challenge, and tagging #BYDFiPBW2025 to enter giveaways. The global crypto community responded with enthusiasm.



The campaign brought the BYDFi community closer together and turned the booth into a vibrant hub where innovation and interaction met.

PBW 2025: A Strong Start for BYDFi

Throughout the day, BYDFi's booth welcomed a steady stream of crypto professionals, investors, and curious newcomers. Visitors demoed MoonX, engaged in real-time conversations about the MemeCoin market, and explored the next phase of on-chain trading. Nearby, a crypto-themed coffee bar added a relaxed touch, reinforcing BYDFi's mission to bring warmth and personality to the digital finance space.

The Paris Blockchain Week journey has only just begun. With more surprises and sessions scheduled from April 9–10, BYDFi promises even more to come.

XRP's price will skyrocket by over 500% to $12.50 in 2028, enabling the cryptocurrency's market value to eclipse Ethereum's.

That's according to new research from Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered Bank.

“That will make XRP the second-largest non-stablecoin digital asset,” wrote Kendrick in a Tuesday note. 

Thus, XRP joins a group of cryptocurrencies that Standard Chartered expects to be the market's big winners. Other members of that group include Bitcoin and Avalanche, while Ethereum is expected to be one of the losers.

The note adds to the bullish hype that has surrounded the Ripple-linked cryptocurrency over the past six months.

The hype has been fuelled by US President Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance and the Securities and Exchange Commission having dropped its case against Ripple. 

Kendrick argued the XRP token and its associated public layer 1 blockchain, the XRP Ledger, are poised to benefit from tokenisation and the ability to facilitate cross-border and cross-currency payments, both fast-growing slices of the crypto pie.

Ripple says tokenisation will be a $19 trillion business by 2033.

“XRP is uniquely positioned at the heart of one of the fastest-growing uses for digital assets — facilitation of cross-border and cross-currency payments,” Kendrick wrote.

Ripple has enjoyed some good news lately. 

The company's founders helped develop the XRP Ledger, and made it open source in 2015. 

Today, the firm still engages the XRPL developer community and provides it with tools, services, and infrastructure support.

The prospect of the SEC approving a spot XRP exchange-traded fund is seen as a potential big boon to the cryptocurrency. 

Polymarket bettors give spot XRP ETFs a 77% chance of being approved in 2025. 

Kendrick said he expected XRP ETFs to be approved between July and September. 

He also estimated that those funds will generate between $4 billion and $8 billion in the first 12 months, echoing JPMorgan, which has made a similar estimate.

Ripple also recently announced a large deal with the United Arab Emirates, that will see its technology used in the Dubai International Financial Centre, itself the host of many crypto firms.

To be sure, XRP's price has dropped about 12% in the past week and punters on crypto-betting platform Polymarket bet it's going to fall even more this month. 

The drop is part of a wider crypto market wipeout that has shaved about 8.8%, or $251 billion, of the total market's value over the past seven days, according to CoinGecko.

The trigger? Trump's so-called “psychodrama” trade policies that have slammed some of the US' closest trading partners, its rivals and even a bunch of penguins with fresh tariffs. 

Even so, Kendrick argued that XRP and other cryptocurrencies will come out of the mess stronger than ever.

“Keep looking for winners and HODLing those you already own,” Kendrick said. “Tariff mess will be over soon, and Bitcoin's solid performance during the noise tells us a leg higher for the asset class will follow.”

Oops, something went wrong

Hut8 announced a new Bitcoin mining subsidiary in partnership with Eric Trump

Trump told CNBC that his interest in bitcoin stemmed from cancel culture, saying his family was "the most canceled company on earth"

American Bitcoin has set out to be "the world's largest, most efficient pure-play miner"

Bitcoin mining company Hut 8 (NASDAQ:HUT) said last week that it is launching a new subsidiary with Eric Trump. American Bitcoin "aims to be the world's largest, most efficient pure-play miner while building a robust strategic Bitcoin reserve," according to a company statement.

Trump told CNBC on Wednesday why he turned to cryptocurrency. His family's namesake firm became "the most canceled company, probably on earth. It's actually what drove us towards cryptocurrency. You realize that cryptocurrency was a lot faster, it was a lot more pragmatic, it was a lot more transparent, it was exponentially cheaper."

Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.55 per share now.

It's no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $250 million in art — this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%. Here's how everyday investors are getting started.

The "cancellation" Trump is referring to happened in 2022, when two Trump Organization units were convicted in New York of multiple crimes. There were 17 charges, including things like tax fraud, falsifying business records, and conspiracy. Guilty verdicts on all counts were handed down just two weeks after Trump's father, Donald Trump, announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election.

There is also the lawsuit the Trump Organization filed against Capital One (NYSE:COF), alleging that the bank illegally closed over 300 of the company's accounts following the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the US Capitol. According to the lawsuit, Capital One was acting on "unsubstantiated ‘woke' beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political views" rather than any legal precedent.

Trending: Have $200K saved? Here's how to turn it into lasting wealth

Eric Trump told CNBC that after "falling in love with the cryptocurrency industry and realizing that "every sophisticated country is using their excess power to mine Bitcoin," he concluded that launching his own coin would be the best way to push back against an economy that has "launched a war on [cryptocurrencies]."

Eric also claimed that, despite his father being back in the White House, there is no conflict of interest with this new venture as he "[doesn't] have anything to do with government and... frankly, doesn't want anything to do with government." President Trump has taken a very pro-crypto stance, creating a strategic crypto reserve and launching a meme coin just before his inauguration.

Eric is pushing the government to adopt a regulatory framework that will allow crypto to grow. "You better believe that China is running very hard at this. The entire Middle East is running very hard. We won the space race. We better win the crypto race," he told CNBC.

Altcoin prices bounced back as some investors bought the dip following the recent crypto Black Monday, when most of them crashed.

Popular tokens like Pepe (PEPE), Solana (SOL), JasmyCoin (JASMY), and Bonk (BONK) rose by double digits from their lowest levels on Monday. 

Pepe, the popular Ethereum (ETH) meme coin, rose to $0.0000065, while SOL, JASMY, and BONK jumped by double digits.

There are three main reasons why these altcoins rose. First, there is hope that the US will move to negotiate with other countries. While tensions with China have risen, Trump has hinted of progress in trade negotiations with Israel, Japan, and Vietnam. 

These hopes have led to a risk-on sentiment among market participants, which explains why the stock market is rising. Futures tied to the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indices have both soared by over 2%, erasing some of the losses from the past few days.

Second, these altcoins have jumped as Wall Street analysts raised their estimates on when the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. In the last meeting, officials guided for two interest rate cuts this year, and in a statement on Friday, Jerome Powell said that he would not be in a hurry to move.

The market, however, now predicts that the bank will deliver more cuts later this year. The closely-watched CME FedWatch tool places the odds of a cut in May at 30%, up from under 20% last week. Goldman Sachs estimates that the bank will deliver three cuts in the second half of the year. On Monday, a JPMorgan analyst warned that the Fed could move as early as May.

Morgan Stanley analysts have also warned that Trump's tariffs will jeopardize the growth outlook for the economy and push for more cuts. The bank estimates at least three cuts this year. 

Altcoins like Solana, Pepe, Jasmy, and Bonk do well when the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates.

Third, the rebound could be part of a dead cat bounce, a brief recovery in a declining market that quickly resumes its downward trend. This price action is also known as a bull trap.

Further, Solana also gained after Janover, a small Wall Street company, changed its management and began accumulating the coin. It raised $42 million from companies like Pantera, Kraken, Arrington Capital, and The Norstar Group. Its goal is to become the MicroStrategy of Solana, one of the biggest blockchains in the industry.

Mehe, Seychelles, April  08, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — 

UnionEx, the next-generation global cryptocurrency exchange, is proud to announce its official launch. Built on advanced blockchain infrastructure, UnionEx offers a secure, transparent and community-driven platform with an aim to realize greater financial inclusion around the world.

Building Value Beyond Trading: The Role of UNB

As part of the official launch, UnionEx has also released its whitepaper, providing a clear blueprint of the platform's long-term vision, ecosystem architecture, and the role of its native utility token UNB. Designed to fuel the UnionEx ecosystem, UNB supports fee discounts, staking rewards, governance participation, and exclusive access to new platform features. It also serves as a key link between UnionEx's global operations and regional hubs, helping align incentives across all markets.

UNB has a total supply of 1 billion, with 65% allocated to community and ecosystem growth. To support long-term value, UnionEx will regularly use a portion of its net profits to repurchase and burn UNB. This process will continue until 50% of the total UNB supply is repurchased and burned

Bitcoin and other altcoins could be at risk as the biggest players on Wall Street warn about the state of the market.

Bitcoin (BTC) price held steady on February 8 and reached an intraday high of $79,300 as investors bought the dip. Other altcoins were also up for the day, with Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Binance Coin (BNB) rising by over 3%. The other top-performing coins were JasmyCoin (JASMY), Core (CORE), and Zcash (ZEC), which rose by over 18%.

The stock market was also upbeat, with futures tied to the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 indices climbing nearly 2%. The rebound came after Donald Trump showed some flexibility on tariffs by agreeing to meetings with countries like Japan and Vietnam.

Still, Wall Street analysts continue to warn about the Liberation Day tariffs, which some see as a black swan event that will cause more damage to the economy. 

On Monday, Goldman Sachs raised its recession odds to 45%. In a separate note on Tuesday, the bank downgraded US stocks from “overweight” to “neutral.” Another team of Goldman analysts warned that the US equity market may be entering a prolonged bear cycle.

Meanwhile, Blackrock's Larry Fink warned that most executives he's spoken with are increasingly worried about a recession. That carries weight, given BlackRock's status as the largest asset manager globally with $11 trillion in assets.

Other Wall Street institutions have echoed these concerns. Citi recently downgraded US equities and advised investors to pivot toward Asia-based markets.

These forecasts matter for crypto markets because of the close correlation between Bitcoin, altcoins like ETH and XRP, and broader risk assets. Historically, these asset classes have tended to move in the same direction.

On the positive side, Bitcoin and altcoins could benefit if the US enters a recession and equities tumble. In that scenario, the Federal Reserve would likely be forced to step in.

Pressure is already mounting on the Fed from both the market and the Trump administration to act before the situation worsens. Trump has cited weakness in the bond market and falling oil prices as reasons for a preemptive rate cut.

Oil prices are down, interest rates are down (the slow moving Fed should cut rates!), food prices are down, there is NO INFLATION, and the long time abused USA is bringing in Billions of Dollars a week from the abusing countries on Tariffs that are already in place. This is…

Further, the derivatives market now prices a 44% chance of a Fed cut in its meeting in May, up from 10 a week ago. Also, Goldman Sachs has predicted that the bank will cut rates three times in the year's second half.

A dovish Federal Reserve would likely be a catalyst for risky assets like Bitcoin, altcoins, and the stock market. A good example is what happened during the COVID-19 pandemic when the Fed slashed rates to zero and implemented quantitative easing policies.

Oops, something went wrong

Ten percent — that's how much the Nasdaq has dropped in just one week. The S&P 500 is close behind, down 8.80%, with the Dow falling 7.60% over the same period.

With all this volatility — as the VIX hit a high of 45.60 — Bitcoin, as of April 4th, is up over 1% on the day.

Weird, right? When it comes to ‘risk-on' assets, Bitcoin has typically been viewed as the riskiest — but over the last few weeks, we've seen a correlation that's anything but typical.

Are you rich? Here's what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.

Bitcoin's Historical Behavior and Correlation with Other Asset Classes

From 2012 through 2023, Bitcoin was either the top or bottom performing asset in every calendar year — never in the middle — per WisdomTree's March 2024 report, "Dynamic Correlations: Bitcoin vs. Other Asset Classes." In nine of those years, it outperformed everything else. But in years like 2018 and 2022, it dropped over 60%, showing how extreme its swings can be.

What's even more interesting is Bitcoin's low and constantly shifting correlation to traditional assets. WisdomTree's data shows its 50-day rolling correlation to the S&P 500 has typically ranged between -0.1 to 0.2, sometimes spiking, but never staying consistent. This suggests that Bitcoin isn't reliably tied to equities and can act differently in times of stress — exactly like what we're seeing now.

"The hardest single thing to understand about correlation is that it is always shifting." – WisdomTree, 2024

So while the broader markets are bleeding, Bitcoin's resilience today could be a glimpse into its evolving role — possibly as a diversifier when traditional assets move in tandem.

Trending: It's no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $250 million in art — this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%. Here's how everyday investors are getting started.

Bitcoin and the S&P 500: Comparing 1-Year Performance Trends

When it comes to the past year's performance as of Friday, Bitcoin is up roughly 25%, while the S&P 500 is down 7%. This means that if you had bought Bitcoin a year ago today, you'd be up, while the opposite is true for the S&P 500.

While this data is not complex and doesn't delve into a more in-depth technical view, it's important to understand. The common view would be to sell Bitcoin during these downturns, as it has been considered the riskiest asset out there, but this simple data set shows otherwise in recent times.

When comparing the weekly structure of Bitcoin to certain US indices, Bitcoin has a much stronger chart in terms of staying above key pivot points.

For example, indices like the S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow are all below the election swing point, while Bitcoin is still trading above that price level.

While this isn't a direct indicator of whether Bitcoin will ultimately hold up during the current uncertain environment, it could mark the beginning of a shift we haven't seen before.

Bitcoin's ability to stay above key levels while traditional assets falter suggests that it may be gaining more traction as a potential hedge or safe haven. In a world where central banks and governments are increasingly pushing the boundaries of monetary policy, Bitcoin's fixed supply and decentralized nature could allow it to act as a store of value in ways that traditional assets cannot.

The Road Ahead for Bitcoin

Despite its reputation for volatility and risk, Bitcoin's recent performance in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty challenges conventional thinking about digital assets. Historically seen as a speculative, high-risk investment, Bitcoin is showing signs of evolving into something more, possibly even a safe haven during turbulent times.

With its continued strength above key price levels and its non-correlated behavior relative to traditional assets like the S&P 500, Bitcoin could be paving the way for a new era of digital asset investment. Whether or not it fully holds up under the pressure of ongoing market turbulence remains to be seen, but the data suggests that those who write it off as a risk asset may be overlooking its emerging role in modern finance.

A founder who has carved out a name for himself building products to help restaurants connect better with would-be diners has raised $50 million for his latest startup: a new take on the idea of customer loyalty. 

Blackbird Labs has built a payments-meets-loyalty-meets-blockchain platform for restaurants to grow repeat business while reducing some of the friction around transactions. Now, with with some 1,000 restaurants signed up, CEO Ben Leventhal said Blackbird plans to use the money to launch its newest product, a cross-restaurant “points” service it's calling Blackbird Club, as well as to expand into more markets outside of New York (its headquarters), San Francisco, and Charleston, South Carolina. 

Why Charleston, you ask? “Charleston punches above its class,” Leventhal said in an interview with TechCrunch. “It's a great restaurant city for its size.” It also appears to be Blackbird's equivalent of New Zealand for Meta, with Leventhal calling it “a good test market for us.”

Spark Capital, a new backer, is leading this latest round, with participation also from Coinbase Ventures, Amex Ventures, and Andreessen Horowitz — three investors that backed Blackbird in its $24 million Series A in 2023. Valuation is not being disclosed, but for a point of reference, PitchBook notes that the startup was valued at around $124 million in that last round. The startup has raised $85 million to date.

Coinbase and Amex are strategic names in that list. 

Amex acquired Resy, a reservations platform that Leventhal previously founded, in 2019. The two companies — Resy and Blackbird — are not integrating now, but “it's fair to say we will,” Leventhal said. Prior to Resy, the third restaurant-focused startup Leventhal founded, the food blog Eater, was also acquired: it's now part of Vox. No plans on how or if that'll lead to a partnership deal.

Blackbird describes its Flynet payment service as a layer-three transaction protocol built on Coinbase's Base. Diners can use it to pay for meals at the table via Blackbird's app, as well as to redeem loyalty points when they visit restaurants. 

It's worth asking whether blockchain was strictly a necessary part of the mix. There are plenty of other loyalty and payment programs in the market, including a number that are direct competitors to Blackbird, like Punchh, Toast, and Lightspeed, built on more conventional financial structures. 

“I don't think it necessarily ‘has to be built on blockchain,'” Leventhal said. “Visa's network, more or less, was created using the same principles that we're using for Flynet, and obviously they didn't have blockchain.”

But Leventhal pointed out, too, that “there are a few things that we do believe that over time will be important opportunities, and those opportunities will be based on being on-chain.” These include how Blackbird and restaurants hold customer profiles and activity, he said. “Consumers will be able to continue to own that profile,” Leventhal told TechCrunch. It also relates to how Blackbird envisions its engagement with restaurants, he said: each restaurant customer ultimately will be a shareholder of Blackbird.

You might think that, with two startups dedicated to the consumer-facing side of the restaurant trade, Leventhal might have had his fill of the business. As it turns out, he's still hungry for more. 

Owning restaurants has long been a challenging enterprise, but the economy and changing consumer habits have especially knocked the world of restaurants around a lot in the last few years. 

Leventhal cites figures from the National Restaurant Association that note that the average profitability of restaurants these days is under 5%, compared to an average of around 20% in the early 2000s.

While platforms like Instagram and TikTok have turned the world into armchair foodies, producing legions of people who virally flock to the latest and coolest cafe, they are doing this amid a time of rapidly declining margins and heightened price sensitivity. These are areas that are only going to get tougher if the U.S. really locks down on its latest tariff hikes.

“There is a disconnect in the restaurant industry between the popularity and the intensity of consumer love for restaurants and ultimately the profitability of the industry,” he said. 

That disconnect, of course, in startup thinking means opportunity. 

“The restaurant industry is made up of millions of local, small business owners around the world,” Arianna Simpson, a general partner at a16z, told TechCrunch over email. “Those restaurants are at the mercy of tech platforms that can charge a large, and often growing, percentage of a restaurant's margin.”

Simpson believes this is specifically where blockchain can play a role: improving that margin structure. “Ben's vision is for a network that is owned by the restaurants and the diners themselves, which is something that only blockchains enable,” she said, adding that Blackbird is already saving its restaurant customers 3-4% in payment processing fees.

Bitcoin has swung wildly over the last week as traders scramble to get ahead of a “crisis scenario” for the bitcoin price.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price has dropped to lows not seen since early November, with panicky crypto holders urged to avoid a mystery threat.

Now, as Wall Street giants stare down the barrel of an “existential" bitcoin and crypto game-changer, Michael Saylor's software company-turned-bitcoin buyer Strategy has warned it could be forced to sell some of its bitcoin to meet its financial obligations.

“As bitcoin constitutes the vast bulk of assets on our balance sheet, if we are unable to secure equity or debt financing in a timely manner, on favorable terms, or at all, we may be required to sell bitcoin to satisfy our financial obligations, and we may be required to make such sales at prices below our cost basis or that are otherwise unfavorable," a Strategy regulatory filing read.

Strategy said it's expecting to record a near-$6 billion unrealized loss for the first quarter, despite a related $1.69 billion income tax benefit, and warned it might not be able to regain profitability in future quarters, especially if the value of its bitcoin continues to plummet.

“A significant decrease in the market value of our bitcoin holdings could adversely affect our ability to satisfy our financial obligations," the filing added.

Strategy's stock price has almost halved since soaring to its November peak that saw it inducted into the prestigious Nasdaq 100 index.
 Strategy, which currently owns almost 530,000 bitcoin worth nearly $42 billion that were bought for an average of $67,000 per bitcoin, has fuelled its bitcoin buys by selling convertible bonds and issuing stock.

At the end of March, Strategy held around $8 billion worth of debt on which it owes about $35 million per year in interest on top of almost $150 million it must pay every year in dividends on its stock.

Meanwhile, crypto analysts are desperately trying to predict where the market is headed next, with one closely-watched analyst issuing a bitcoin price prediction that would see bitcoin crash back to around $10,000.

“Everyone's in for the long-term, as long as it's going up," Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone, wrote in a report posted to X. “[I] did not know how bitcoin was going to get to $100,000 from $10,000 in 2020, but the trends showed up. Now, I see the reversion path back toward $10,000.”

With AI, the multichain AI-powered NFT platform, has announced that it has also integrated the crypto XRP. Now, users can create and transfer their NFTs on XRP Ledger more efficiently, benefiting from real-time Artificial Intelligence that automates metadata management and contract logic.

Summary

The AI-powered multichain NFT platform, Colle AI, seems to have also integrated the crypto XRP into its ecosystem. 

In practice, from now on, users can create and transfer NFTs on the XRP Ledger more efficiently, thanks to real-time AI support that automates metadata management and contract logic.

In fact, Colle AI is precisely focused on leveraging Artificial Intelligence to simplify the process of creating NFTs, allowing artists and creators to easily transform their ideas into digital assets. The platform aims to make the creation of NFTs more accessible, promoting innovation in the digital art space.

The latest advancements of the platform allow for faster transactions, reduced friction in the implementation of NFT, and broader access to liquidity on the XRP Ledger. 

Not only, the expansion of XRP support includes improved routing algorithms, optimized gas estimation, and updated compatibility with the smart contract engine powered by Colle AI.

In addition to XRP and XRP Ledger, Colle AI has already announced its support for other chains. In fact, XRP joins the blockchains of Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana and Bitcoin.

Regarding Solana, Colle AI recently announced that it has expanded its strategy to strengthen AI tools and liquidity.

“Colle AI amplifies its Solana strategy to strengthen AI tools and liquidity, driving next-generation multichain NFT performance and seamless scalability across the #Web3 ecosystem”

In any case, the broader infrastructural goals of Colle AI are to simplify the creation of multichain through intelligent tools and ensure that NFTs move freely and securely across ecosystems.

Beyond AI and NFT, Ripple today made headlines also for the report created with Boston Consulting Group (BCG), regarding tokenization. 

Specifically, the report predicts that by 2033, the market for tokenized assets will grow from 0.6 trillion dollars to 18.9 trillion dollars, with a CAGR of 53%. 

This growth will occur in three phases: 1) low-risk adoption, 2) institutional expansion, and 3) market transformation, with tokenization being incorporated into financial and non-financial products.

The crypto market's waking up again—and this time, the buzz isn't about hype tokens or copycat coins. It's about utility. From scalable blockchain layers to AI integration and cross-chain platforms, the digital asset space is stacking real-world value. And when the next bull run kicks in, the altcoins with actual use cases are gonna be the ones flying off the shelves.

Leading that charge is Qubetics ($TICS), a presale powerhouse that's doing what few others even attempt—fixing blockchain fragmentation through real-world interoperability. While others race to patch things together with middleware, Qubetics is laying a smooth, unified foundation that works across chains, apps, and borders.

If the goal is to stack smart ahead of the bull run, these are the best altcoins to buy for next bull run—each one packing substance, scalability, and staying power.

Every blockchain wants to be the center of the universe. The problem? None of them play nice with each other. Qubetics steps in with a clean, modular framework that actually makes cross-chain activity feel seamless—for users, devs, and businesses alike.

Let's say Vanessa runs a small gaming studio in Seattle. Her game uses NFTs minted on Polygon, in-game tokens on Solana, and a DAO governed on Ethereum. Total chaos, right? Not with Qubetics. With just one dashboard, she can sync assets, manage contracts, and trigger cross-chain actions—without ever leaving the app.

Then there's Ben, a logistics manager in Dallas using stablecoins to pay contractors in Canada and Argentina. Qubetics allows him to initiate those transactions in one currency and settle in another, all on-chain, all instant, without sweating about network bridges or gas fees across different blockchains.

For the average crypto user? Think of it like being able to move money and assets across blockchains as easily as switching tabs in a browser. No middlemen. No double-wrapping. No mental gymnastics.

Qubetics has been on a tear. It just added native support for SEI and SUI networks, expanding its bridge ecosystem and routing capabilities across even more high-throughput chains. The platform also rolled out QubeFlow, a backend API system that lets businesses plug interoperability into their apps without needing a dev army.

Developer engagement is rising, especially from DeFi startups and fintech builders who want flexibility without fragmentation. That surge in traction is reflected in growing GitHub commits, wallet activations, and pilot partnerships with logistics and gaming platforms across North America.

And while many blockchains are still pitching MVPs, Qubetics is shipping product after product.

Let's talk numbers. The Qubetics crypto presale is now in Stage 29 and has already pulled in 506 million tokens sold across 24,400+ holders, raising $15.9 million.

At just $0.1573 per $TICS token, the runway is wide open. Analyst predictions? They're bullish for a reason:

$TICS at $1 post-presale = 535% ROI
 $TICS at $5 = 3078% ROI
 $TICS at $6 = 3713% ROI
 $TICS at $10 = 6256% ROI
 $TICS at $15 = 9434% ROI after mainnet launch

Those numbers aren't fantasy—they're based on platform adoption, token demand, and the unique value Qubetics brings to a fragmented crypto world.

Qubetics is solving one of the biggest pain points in crypto—interoperability—and doing it with elegance and scale. With a packed presale, working apps, and cross-chain power, $TICS is without question one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

AI is exploding. So is the demand for high-performance GPU rendering. Enter Render—a decentralized platform that connects content creators with idle GPUs for rendering 3D content, AI workloads, and metaverse assets.

It's like Airbnb for processing power. Artists and developers get the compute they need. GPU owners earn RNDR tokens by renting their rigs. Everyone wins.

And with content creators shifting into virtual production, gaming, and interactive experiences, Render's utility is going off the charts.

2024 was big. But 2025? Even bigger. Render integrated with several top-tier AI labs and is now powering generative content workflows for indie studios and enterprise media houses.

It also launched tools for Blender, Unreal Engine, and Unity—cutting out the usual red tape and bringing Render tech into mainstream creative tools. That's opened the door to thousands of new users across animation, architecture, and entertainment.

Institutional interest is rising too. GPU farms and AI labs are exploring ways to monetize unused compute, and Render is one of the few platforms making that economically viable.

Render is solving a real bottleneck in the AI and creative space—affordable, scalable rendering. With rising adoption and mainstream integrations, it's easily one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

SUI is a high-speed layer-1 blockchain built from scratch using the Move programming language. Its claim to fame? Parallel execution. That means transactions don't wait in line—they're processed simultaneously, drastically boosting performance and lowering latency.

For DeFi builders, that's a godsend. For gamers? Even better. And for financial apps that need reliability? It's gold.

In early 2025, SUI faced sell pressure after a major token unlock. But instead of collapsing, it bounced. Why? Because usage was up, apps kept shipping, and the dev community doubled down.

The chain is now handling millions of daily transactions, most of them tied to gaming and DeFi protocols. It also launched new zero-knowledge toolkits for privacy-focused applications.

And while other networks slow down or choke during high usage, SUI keeps humming. That alone is making it a go-to for apps that need constant uptime.

SUI has the right tech stack for real-world use—especially in high-frequency applications. With scalability, dev support, and speed baked in, it's a top pick among the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

SEI is carving out its niche as the blockchain for trading dApps. With its native order-matching engine, sub-second finality, and ultra-low latency, SEI is basically tailor-made for exchanges, order books, and algorithmic traders.

Imagine Nasdaq functionality on-chain—that's the goal. And so far? It's working.

In Q1 2025, SEI's ecosystem exploded with DEXs, perps platforms, and trading tools all launching with native SEI support. Builders are choosing SEI not because it's trendy—but because it actually works when traffic spikes.

The chain recently added new tooling for TradFi-style compliance, drawing attention from serious fintechs. And integrations with major analytics and custody platforms mean SEI is becoming more than just fast—it's becoming reliable.

SEI is focused, fast, and tailored to one of the most profitable segments of crypto—trading. With unmatched speed and growing adoption, it earns its place among the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.



EOS fell off the radar for a while—but now it's roaring back. The network launched EOS EVM, a high-speed Ethereum-compatible chain built to finally bring dApps to EOS without sacrificing speed or composability.

It also got new leadership and a dev reboot through the EOS Network Foundation. The vibe has shifted from “rugged potential” to “refocused power.”

Thanks to EVM compatibility, DeFi protocols from Ethereum and BNB Chain are now bridging into EOS with ease. That's sparked a fresh wave of liquidity pools, lending markets, and NFT protocols launching on EOS.

New grant programs are rewarding developers, and updated documentation has lowered the barrier to entry for smaller teams and indie projects.

The user base is growing, the tech is clean, and the comeback is real.

EOS is rebuilding from the ground up, with better tech and stronger leadership. As DeFi and NFTs expand, its renewed momentum makes it one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run—especially at its current undervalued range.

Crypto doesn't wait. The next bull run won't either. While others chase hype, these five altcoins are building like the market's already flipped. Qubetics is laying the foundation for a fully interoperable future. Render is powering the AI and metaverse engine room. SUI is all about speed and scale. SEI is dialed in for trading. And EOS is pulling off one of the cleanest comebacks in the game.

For anyone looking to front-run the next breakout moment, these are the best altcoins to buy for next bull run—built on code, community, and crazy potential.

 SUI enables parallel transaction execution, making it ideal for high-speed, high-traffic apps like gaming and DeFi.

SEI is tailored for trading, with a native matching engine, near-instant finality, and architecture designed for financial apps.

Yes—new leadership, EVM compatibility, and a wave of new dApps have reignited EOS's ecosystem.

                    Stock prices of crypto-focused companies also saw declines in early trading Monday [File]

After holding relatively stable during last week's global market turmoil, cryptocurrencies have joined the sell-off.

Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency dipped below $75,000 Monday morning before seeing a slight rebound.

Bitcoin's prices haven't been this low since just after President Donald Trump's Election Day victory last year launched a bull run in crypto prices. Trump, whose tariff announcements led to massive stock sell offs, has been a major promoter of the crypto industry and previously took credit when bitcoin's price broke $100,000 in December. Bitcoin has been on a relatively steady slide in price since Trump took office earlier this year. 

Bitcoin's backers say it is a type of digital gold that can act as a hedge against volatility. But Garrick Hileman, an independent cryptocurrency analyst, said bitcoin's price slide shows that thesis still hasn't proven to be true.

“It's just not there today,” he said. “(Bitcoin) trades like a risky tech stock.”

Other major digital assets saw even bigger one-day percentage drops on Monday morning.

Ether, the second most popular crypto token, was trading at about $1,500 on Monday morning. It's lost about half of its value since Trump's son, Eric Trump, encouraged his followers on social media to buy ether in early February.

President Trump's own meme coin, which he launched just before taking office and once hit a high of more than $70, dipped below $8 Monday morning.

Stock prices of crypto-focused companies also saw declines in early trading Monday.

With new crypto projects launching daily, the market is filled with diverse assets for investors, each with its peculiarities and unique use cases. Some of these new cryptocurrencies have promising outlooks that make them shiny and exciting to investors looking to enter the market for opportunities to earn profits.

However, finding the best altcoins to buy now is not necessarily a walk in the park. It requires a deep knowledge of how the market works, knowing how to find solid projects early, and identifying the long-term potential of new crypto projects.

One such altcoin with potential right now is Dawgz AI, a new meme coin powered by AI for traders and investors. Let's find out more about Dawgz AI and how to spot the best altcoins to buy now.

If you are looking for Dawgz AI alternatives to diversify your portfolio, you may consider backing similar projects that could explode in the future using the following tips:

Projects that lack such details, especially those without a whitepaper and realistic roadmaps, are potential red flags.

Now, let's check out each project in more detail.

Based on the current state of the crypto market, the best altcoin to buy now is Dawgz AI. The new crypto project has been hosting its presale for a couple of months and has raised over $3.2 million in the process. Besides the presale, Dawgz AI tops the list of the best altcoins for the next bull run for many reasons. Let's check them out below.

One of the reasons Dawgz AI is currently shining through the market is its massive price potential. Though the token is trading at just $0.004 at the time of writing, it holds bigger promises judging by its ongoing presale success. For context, those who invested in Dawgz AI early have pocketed nearly 100% gains between when the presale began and the present day.

That means the meme coin has outperformed the biggest cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana in 2025. Also, investors anticipate that the Dawgz AI price will experience a significant future increase based on its strong presale numbers. The project is yet to fully launch, so its official launch and exchange listing could drive its value to massive highs in the near future.

With Dawgz AI, investors have more than just a meme coin with social media hype. Instead, the token offers different use cases, one of which is its artificial intelligence (AI) trading platform.

The feature allows Dawgz AI users, especially traders and investors, to access AI-trained crypto trading bots, which can execute trading activities on their behalf. For instance, instead of monitoring the markets yourself and staying glued to the screen for hours, you can leverage the trading bots since they can trade on your behalf around the clock.

With the possibility of trading 365 days a year, you can boost your potential profits significantly without little to no human interactions. You also get to reduce human errors that may occur from sentiment or other psychological factors.

Ripple's XRP is another top altcoin to consider investing in this year. Based on its initial price movements in the first quarter of the year that saw it reach an all-time high price of $3.84, XRP could reach newer heights when the market regains momentum.

Moreover, the current XRP price is around $1.90, making it a cheap altcoin that can fit into anyone's portfolio regardless of their capital.

The Binance Coin (BNB) is a notable altcoin with a remarkable price history. The BNB price surged to a high of around $793 in late 2024, and investors are optimistic it could be the next altcoin to reach four figures during the next bull run.

However, the current BNB price stands at around $550, making it a relatively expensive asset to purchase by beginner investors who may have limited capital.

Now, you've learned about Dawgz AI, the hottest altcoin on the market and how to find similar assets to combine and build a solid portfolio. Ready to launch into the market for the best altcoins to buy? Visit the Dawgz AI website and stack up some tokens at a limited-time low cost of $0.004 now.

Dawgz AI is a solid altcoin with potential. The meme token has been experiencing massive success since its presale began.

The crypto with 1,000x potential is Dawgz AI. Already, the AI-powered coin has surged by nearly 100% before its launch and has the potential for bigger numbers.

Currently trading at $0.004, Dawgz AI is the leading asset under 1 cent that is poised to explode soon.

The altcoin to potentially explode this year is Dawgz AI. The meme coin is set for a massive post-launch pump that could cause its value to skyrocket.

Repayments with USDT, USDC, and DAI show positive correlation with Ethereum volatility, suggesting de-risking movements.

Repayments of on-chain loans using stablecoins can often serve as an early warning indicator of liquidity shifts and volatility spikes in Ethereum's (ETH) price, according to a recent Amberdata report. 

The report highlighted how lending behaviors within DeFi ecosystems, particularly repayment frequency, can serve as early indicators of emerging market stress.

The study examined the connection between Ethereum price movements and stablecoin-based lending activity involving USDC, USDT, and DAI. The analysis revealed a consistent relationship between heightened repayment activity and increased ETH price fluctuations.

The report used the Garman-Klass (GK) estimator. This statistical model accounts for the full intraday price range, including open, high, low, and close prices, rather than relying solely on closing prices. 

According to the report, this method enables more accurate measurement of price swings, particularly during high-activity periods in the market.

Amberdata applied the GK estimator to ETH price data across trading pairs with USDC, USDT, and DAI. The resulting volatility values were then correlated with DeFi lending metrics to assess how transactional behaviors influence market trends. 

Across all three stablecoin ecosystems, the number of loan repayments showed the strongest and most consistent positive correlation with Ethereum volatility. For USDC, the correlation was 0.437; for USDT, 0.491; and DAI, 0.492. 

These results suggest that frequent repayment activity tends to coincide with market uncertainty or stress, during which traders and institutions adjust their positions to manage risk.

A rising number of repayments may reflect de-risking behaviors, such as closing leveraged positions or reallocating capital in response to price movements. Amberdata views this as evidence that repayment activity may be an early indicator of changes in liquidity conditions and upcoming Ethereum market volatility spikes.

In addition to repayment frequency, withdrawal-related metrics displayed moderate correlations with ETH volatility. For instance, the withdrawal amounts and frequency ratio in the USDC ecosystem exhibited correlations of 0.361 and 0.357, respectively.

These numbers suggest that fund outflows from lending platforms, regardless of size, may signal defensive positioning by market participants, reducing liquidity and amplifying price sensitivity.

The report also examined other lending metrics, including borrowed amounts and repayment volumes. In the USDT ecosystem, the dollar-denominated amounts for repayments and borrows correlate with ETH volatility at 0.344 and 0.262, respectively. 

While less pronounced than the count-based repayment signals, these metrics still contribute to the broader picture of how transactional intensity can reflect market sentiment.

DAI displayed a similar pattern on a smaller scale. The frequency of loan settlements remained a strong signal, while the ecosystem's smaller average transaction sizes muted the correlation strength of volume-based metrics. 

Notably, metrics such as dollar-denominated withdrawals in DAI showed a very low correlation (0.047), reinforcing the importance of transaction frequency over transaction size in identifying volatility signals in this context.

The report also highlighted the issue of multicollinearity, which is high intercorrelation between independent variables within each stablecoin lending dataset. 

For example, in the USDC ecosystem, the number of repays and withdrawals showed a pairwise correlation of 0.837, indicating that these metrics may capture similar user behavior and could introduce redundancy in predictive models.

Nevertheless, the analysis concludes that repayment activity is a robust indicator of market stress, offering a data-driven lens through which DeFi metrics can interpret and anticipate price conditions in Ethereum markets.

Ethereum (ETH) suffered a more than 27% crash within the past 48 hours, briefly dropping to a two-year low of $1,410 before recovering the $1,500 level on Monday. The decline, per Coinglass data, sparked $257.87 million in liquidations across ETH's derivatives market during the period.

On-chain data also shows most investors are capitulating, sending ETH realized losses past $500 million, according to Santiment. Most recent selling activity stems from coins purchased in the past month, highlighting short-term holders' strong reaction to downside price moves.

Furthermore, coins aged 1Y to 2Y are joining the selling but at a modest pace. An increase in selling pressure from this cohort could spark an extended decline in ETH as most buy-the-dip activity has largely flowed into addresses related to them.

Increased liquidations across DeFi protocols have partly accelerated ETH's decline.

Sky, formerly Maker, liquidated a whale's collateral of 53,074 ETH worth $74 million at the time, per Lookonchain data.

Sky allows users to create and borrow DAI stablecoin using ETH as collateral. The protocol automatically liquidates borrowers' positions when the value of their collateral drops below a certain threshold.

Another whale with a collateral of 220K ETH added 10K ETH and 3.52M DAI to reduce its liquidation price to $1,119. The whale risks losing all its collateral if ETH plunges below $1,119.

Similar liquidations are visible in lending platform Aave, where the protocol recorded over $162 million in liquidated collateral on Monday, according to @KARTOD Dune dashboard.

Ethereum is grappling with the support level near $1,522 after seeing a quick bounce off the lower boundary of a descending channel that extends back to December. The top altcoin could suffer a further decline to the support near $1,000 if it breaches the channel's lower boundary.

On the upside, ETH could see a rejection near the $1,800 resistance, which is strengthened by a key descending trendline.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram bars are below their neutral level, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in the oversold region. This indicates dominant bearish momentum but with a potential for a reversal.

Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain with smart contracts functionality. Its native currency Ether (ETH), is the second-largest cryptocurrency and number one altcoin by market capitalization. The Ethereum network is tailored for building crypto solutions like decentralized finance (DeFi), GameFi, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), etc.

Ethereum is a public decentralized blockchain technology, where developers can build and deploy applications that function without the need for a central authority. To make this easier, the network leverages the Solidity programming language and Ethereum virtual machine which helps developers create and launch applications with smart contract functionality.

Smart contracts are publicly verifiable codes that automates agreements between two or more parties. Basically, these codes self-execute encoded actions when predetermined conditions are met.

Staking is a process of earning yield on your idle crypto assets by locking them in a crypto protocol for a specified duration as a means of contributing to its security. Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism on September 15, 2022, in an event christened “The Merge.” The Merge was a key part of Ethereum's roadmap to achieve high-level scalability, decentralization and security while remaining sustainable. Unlike PoW, which requires the use of expensive hardware, PoS reduces the barrier of entry for validators by leveraging the use of crypto tokens as the core foundation of its consensus process.

Gas is the unit for measuring transaction fees that users pay for conducting transactions on Ethereum. During periods of network congestion, gas can be extremely high, causing validators to prioritize transactions based on their fees.

BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes says that altcoins may finally see a boost once Bitcoin (BTC) breaks a certain price range.

In a new interview on Crypto Banter, Hayes, the founder of crypto investment firm Maelstrom, says that he's expecting Bitcoin to continue dominating the crypto market for some time.

However, Hayes says once BTC soars well above the $100,000 level again, riskier crypto assets will most likely start to shine.

“We accelerated a bit after the recent Fed press conference where Powell announced the reduction of QT (quantitative tightening) and sort of teased QE (quantitative easing). 

We accelerated a bit, and if the market continues to collapse a bit, we'll probably accelerate even more in terms of deploying capital. Most of what we're buying is Bitcoin, I think Bitcoin dominance – that is the percentage of Bitcoin in the whole cryptocurrency market – continues to rise, and then at some point, let's say Bitcion's at $110,000 or $120,000 or some level, then altcoins will start to get to fire, and we'll rotate out of that and into some things that we really like.”

In the altcoin space, Hayes says he's looking for Ethereum (ETH) to outperform Solana (SOL).

“I hold a lot of Ethereum, I think at some point, the Ethereum hate is going to change. Usually, the most hated asset is the best-performing asset in the next cycle and the most loved is the worst-performing. 

It's just mean reversion; it doesn't necessarily mean that one is better than the other. But if I had to deploy a fresh dollar of capital today, I'd buy ETH rather than Solana just because ETH is more hated than Solana.

And I think the memecoin fad is going to be done for a while, not to say it's going away, I think memecoins are going to be here to stay for a very long time, but a lot of retail people lost a lot of money, and they're not going to be slinging stuff on Pump.fun and creating transaction fees for Solana as much as they used to. 

So I think that narrative about Solana being the memecoin L1, that's going to hurt its ability to really outpace other L1s in the cycle.”

Researchers have shown that differences in the entire rotavirus genome -- not just its two surface proteins -- affect how well vaccines work, helping to explain why some strains are more likely to infect vaccinated individuals.

The study, published today as a Reviewed Preprint in eLife, is described by the editors as an important paper. They say the novel approach to estimating rotavirus vaccine effectiveness provides convincing evidence that rotavirus vaccines should be designed based on the whole genome of circulating strains, rather than the previous use of two surface proteins. The findings will have implications for future rotavirus vaccine design, as well as type-specific vaccine evaluation more generally.

Rotavirus is a contagious gastrointestinal infection that causes inflammation of the stomach and intestines (gastroenteritis), marked by severe dehydrating diarrhea. Two main vaccines, Rotarix (RV1) and RotaTeq (RV5), have significantly reduced cases of severe illness from rotavirus in the US, but they do not provide perfect protection.

Scientists have speculated that genetic differences between circulating rotavirus strains and vaccine strains may affect how well they work. Traditionally, these differences have been quantified using two proteins on the virus' outer shell -- VP7 and VP4.

"We set out to investigate why some vaccinated children still get sick with rotavirus," says lead author Jiye Kwon, a PhD student at the Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, and the Public Health Modeling Unit, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, US. "Previous research has focused on just the outer proteins of the virus, but rotavirus has a total of 11 genetic segments. We wanted to look at the full genome to explore whether these remaining nine segments, the viral 'backbone', may explain the variation in vaccine effectiveness against rotavirus strains."

To investigate, Kwon and colleagues examined 254 cases of rotavirus-related illness in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals from seven medical sites across the US between 2012 and 2016. They used the whole genome sequencing data from these cases to analyse the full genetic code of each virus strain and compare it to either the Rotarix (RV1) or the RotaTeq (RV5) vaccine. They sought to identify whether vaccine effectiveness decreased as the genetic distance between virus and vaccine strains increased, as well as to examine how the genetic diversity of rotavirus changes in areas with higher vaccine coverage.

To measure genetic distance they used a technique called sieve analysis, a flexible statistical method that allowed them to measure the percentage difference of nucleotide bases -- the molecular 'letters' that make up the genetic code -- between each case strain and the vaccine strain(s).

Their results revealed that individuals vaccinated with Rotarix (RV1) were more likely to be infected by rotavirus strains that were significantly genetically different from the vaccine -- more than 9.6% different in their full genome. Circulating viral strains that were genetically similar to the virus had a viral backbone called genogroup 1 (Wa-like). On the other hand, the genetically distant strains tended to have a different viral backbone called genogroup 2 (DS-1-like) or have mix-and-match variants known as reassortant strains.

Vaccine effectiveness results also reflected this genetic pattern. The Rotarix (RV1) vaccine provided strong protection against genetically similar viral strains, but its protection dropped significantly for more genetically distant strains. The RotaTeq (RV5) vaccine followed a similar pattern, but differences in its effectiveness were less pronounced.

Next, the team looked at whether vaccination patterns in different locations influenced the rotavirus strains circulating in the population. They found that in places where more people used Rotarix (RV1), rotavirus strains that were genetically distant dominated. This was also observed in areas with high usage of RotaTeq (RV5). This suggests that, over time, rotavirus is naturally adapting in response to vaccine-induced immunity, leading to shifts in the genetic makeup of circulating strains to favour those genetically different from the vaccine.

"Current vaccines still provide strong protection against severe illness in rotavirus, but these findings highlight the need to continually monitor viral evolution to maintain vaccine effectiveness in the long term," says Kwon.

The team caution that their study is limited by a relatively small sample size of cases, due to the requirement of whole genome sequencing data. They call for future studies to further validate their findings in other settings where whole genome sequencing data is more widely available.

"Our study shows that looking at the entire genetic structure of rotavirus gives a much clearer picture of how well vaccines work compared to just looking at the two surface proteins," says co-senior author Virginia Pitzer, Associate Professor in the Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, and the Public Health Modeling Unit, Yale School of Public Health. "This highlights the importance of incorporating the full genomic structure of viruses when designing vaccines. There are now four rotavirus vaccines currently available and more in the pipeline; our framework for using whole genome sequencing data to understand how all gene segments contribute to immune protection could be crucial for maintaining their long-term success."

New research from Weill Cornell Medicine has uncovered a surprising culprit underlying cardiovascular diseases in obesity and diabetes -- not the presence of certain fats, but their suppression. The study, published Feb. 25 in Nature Communications, challenges the conventional belief that a type of fat called ceramides accumulates in blood vessels causing inflammation and health risks. Instead, their findings reveal that when ceramides decrease in endothelial cells lining blood vessels, it can be damaging and cause chronic illnesses. Ironically, the findings could ultimately lead to therapies that maintain high levels of these protective lipids in patients with obesity.

Ceramides are found throughout the body and in the endothelium, the thin lining inside blood vessels. These waxy lipids regulate blood vessel tone, dilating or contracting vessels to modulate blood pressure. They also help prevent blood clots, keeping blood flowing easily through the body's extensive highway of arteries and veins.

"The common assumption in the field was that high levels of ceramides in the endothelium of blood vessels contributed to cardiovascular disease, but this conclusion was extrapolated from in vitro data in cells," said Dr. Annarita Di Lorenzo, professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine. "Ours is the first in vivo study that measures the levels of the lipids in the endothelial cells of an animal model. In obese mice fed a high-fat diet, ceramides do not build up -- they decrease compared to lean mice." Also working on this research are co-first authors Dr. Onorina L. Manzo, postdoctoral associate and Luisa Rubinelli, both in Dr. Di Lorenzo's lab.

Ceramide to the Rescue

Dr. Di Lorenzo and her team discovered the importance of ceramides in blood vessels two years ago. Together with Dr. Giuseppe Faraco, assistant professor of neuroscience at Weill Cornell Medicine, they found that decreased levels of ceramides in otherwise healthy mice causes severe blood vessel inflammation in the brain, clot formation and death. Last year, the team reported that ceramide production increases as a protective response in a mouse model of coronary artery disease. Ultimately, when ceramide is broken down by the body it produces a compound called sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which builds up and protects mice against cardiovascular disease. But when this process doesn't work the mice are left vulnerable.

The researchers also found that two proteins, Nogo-B and ORMDL, decreased the production of ceramides and S1P in obesity. This decrease leads to increased blood pressure, impaired vascular regulation and higher glucose levels -- all of which contribute to cardiometabolic conditions that affect the heart (cardiovascular system) and energy processing (metabolism), like diabetes like diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease and stroke.

Maintaining Balance

To understand how these different molecules interact, the researchers tested what happens in animal models. Mice with obesity fed a high-fat diet had low levels of ceramides and S1P, but high levels of Nogo-B. These mice showed signs of inflammation, diabetes and high blood pressure.

But what happens if the Nogo-B inhibitor wasn't present? The researchers knocked out Nogo-B only in the endothelium of blood vessels in a mouse model to find out. "These mice have the same body weight and diabetes as controls, but their blood vessel health is much better," said Dr. Di Lorenzo. "By knocking out this inhibitor, we preserved vascular health. This also showed that the regulation of ceramide metabolism causes vascular dysfunction and inflammation in obesity."

The paper suggests that targeting this metabolic pathway could have multiple beneficial effects in the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases related to obesity. "Nogo suppresses biosynthesis of ceramides, so if we can identify a drug that can block Nogo-B, we could restore ceramide levels to a healthy balance and this would fight not only obesity and diabetes, but would directly keep blood vessels functioning properly," she said.

Experimental drug NU-9 -- a small molecule compound approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical trials for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) -- improves neuron health in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, according to a new Northwestern University study.

Like ALS, Alzheimer's disease also results from misfolded proteins that damage brain health. Rather than treating symptoms from specific diseases, NU-9 instead addresses the underlying mechanisms of disease. Results from the new study give scientists hope that the drug should demonstrate effectiveness in the common mechanisms that give rise to multiple neurodegenerative diseases.

"This drug is quite remarkable that it works in these multiple systems," said Northwestern's Richard B. Silverman, who invented NU-9. "We need to test it in humans before we know how effective it is in treating Alzheimer's disease. But how well upper motor neurons function in mice is similar to how well they function in humans. So, it seems to me, NU-9 really should work."

The study was published last month (March 3) in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The paper demonstrates the drug's efficacy in cellular cultures and a small mouse study.

"What our study demonstrates is that the same mechanism affects two totally different proteins in two totally different diseases," said Northwestern's William Klein, the study's co-corresponding author. "In both diseases, cells suffer from toxic protein buildup. It appears there is a common mechanism that gets rid of these proteins to prevent them from clustering. NU-9 is rescuing the pathway that saves the cell. It's very exciting."

Silverman, who previously invented pregabalin (Lyrica) to treat fibromyalgia, nerve pain and epilepsy, is the Patrick G. Ryan/Aon Professor of Chemistry at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and founder of Akava Therapeutics, a startup company which is commercializing NU-9. An expert on Alzheimer's disease, Klein is a professor of neurobiology at Weinberg and cofounder of Acumen Pharmaceuticals, which has a therapeutic monoclonal antibody to treat Alzheimer's disease currently in clinical trials.

In patients with neurodegenerative diseases, misfolded proteins clump together inside brain cells. This accumulation of misfolded proteins leads to toxicity that disrupts normal brain function and eventually triggers brain cells to die. While misfolded SOD1 proteins (among others) cause ALS, misfolded amyloid beta oligomers cause Alzheimer's disease.

"These are good proteins gone bad," Klein said. "They are good proteins, but when they clump together, they play a role in their own build up. They stick to the cells, to the nearby cells and to the synapses. That causes brain dysfunction and, ultimately, brain cell death."

In previous studies, Silverman and longtime collaborator P. Hande Ozdinler, an associate professor of neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, discovered that NU-9 helped cells remove the protein clumps caused by two unrelated mutated proteins to restore neuron function in animal models with ALS. Silverman and Klein wanted to explore whether NU-9 might have a similar effect on Alzheimer's disease.

To conduct the new study, the team started with cultures of neurons from a small animal model. In one experiment, the scientists added a form of amyloid beta to these cells. The amyloid beta oligomers quickly formed and stuck to cells. In another experiment, the scientists treated the cells with NU-9 before adding the amyloid beta. NU-9 reduced the amount of protein buildup within the cell and along the cell's branches, or dendrites. Even after the researchers removed NU-9 from the treated cells, the drug still had a lasting, protective effect.

After demonstrating NU-9's success in cell cultures, the team tested its effectiveness in a whole animal model. They administered an oral dose of NU-9 to a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and found the animals' performance on memory tests improved. In promising follow-up studies, the team also found NU-9 reduces brain inflammation associated with Alzheimer's disease.

"Inflammation of the brain was prevented or greatly reduced by the treatment of NU-9," Klein said. "It stops the amyloid beta oligomer buildup, and also stops the consequences of neuroinflammation, which causes a lot of damage in the brain. So, the drug is very powerful on two levels: cellular and whole animal."

Although the researchers are still trying to fully understand how NU-9 works, they made some key discoveries. They found NU-9 specifically prevents the buildup of amyloid beta oligomers that form inside cells but doesn't prevent these proteins from forming outside cells. This means NU-9 must be working on a process within the cell to prevent harmful protein clusters.

After further analysis, the researchers found the drug relies on lysosomes, which are one of the cells' major recycling centers, and on an enzyme called cathepsin B. In Alzheimer's disease, this recycling system is disrupted, causing amyloid beta to accumulate. NU-9 might help move amyloid beta proteins into the lysosomes, where cathepsin B then helps break down the protein clumps.

"Cells have two important 'junk compartments': the lysosome and the proteasome," Silverman said. "They collect junk and other components that are not useful to the cell, chew them up and get rid of them. We found the proteasome wasn't involved at all. It's the lysosome that plays a role in how NU-9 works. But we're still trying to figure out exactly what NU-9 binds to in order to trigger the lysosome."

"It's a black box phenomenon," Klein added. "It's like a relay race for moving these toxic clustered proteins around the cell. The proteins are clustered in one vesicle and then another vesicle and then finally handed off to the lysosome. We think NU-9 targets something in the early stage of that relay, but we don't know exactly what the target is."

Although the results are promising, the researchers say there is still a long road ahead. Klein emphasizes the need for more rigorous memory testing with the animal models. And Silverman aims to further refine the compound to make it even more effective.

The team also plans to explore the effectiveness on NU-9 in other neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.

"It has long been thought that every neurodegenerative disease is a completely separate disease, but our findings suggest that common mechanisms might connect them," Silverman said. "This discovery opens the door to a new family of therapeutic compounds that, like NU-9, could control multiple degenerative diseases at a point before major damage to cells begins."

Did Scientists Actually De-Extinct the Dire Wolf?

Colossal Bioscience says it has “de-extincted” the dire wolf, but other scientists disagree and say more important conservation science is being lost in all the hype

By Andrea Thompson edited by Dean Visser

One of the "dire wolves" created by Colossal Biosciences.

The television series Game of Thrones helped popularize dire wolves, but the creatures don't just represent a figment of science fiction: the dire wolf was a real animal that went extinct around 10,000 years ago. On Monday Colossal Biosciences, a Dallas, Tex.–based biotechnology company, announced that it brought the species back with the birth of two pups last October and a third this past January.

(The company had previously announced the development of a “woolly mouse,” or a mouse whose genome was edited to give it brown, shaggy fur like that of the extinct woolly mammoth.)

But many scientists say what Colossal produced this time is not, in fact, the dire wolf. Rather, they say, it is a gray wolf whose genome has been edited to give it some dire-wolf-like traits.

Dire wolves (Aenocyon dirus) are an extinct carnivore that lived throughout what are today North and South America during the Pleistocene and early Holocene epochs (about 250,000 to 10,000 years ago). First described in the 1850s, their fossils have been found all over the Americas, perhaps most famously in Los Angeles' La Brea Tar Pits.

These predators could grow up to six feet in length, and their large skull and jaws were adapted to take down Pleistocene megafauna such as mastodons and bison. It is thought that dire wolves died out as their prey did.

Because of skeletal similarities, scientists had thought that dire wolves were relatives of modern gray wolves. But DNA evidence published in a 2021 study found dire wolves belonged to a much older evolutionary lineage of dogs. The resemblance between dire wolves and gray wolves is an example of convergent evolution, when species separately evolve similar adaptations because they lead a similar lifestyle, the study's researchers said at the time.

“This is a designer dog. This is a genetically modified gray wolf.”—Jacquelyn Gill, paleoecologist

Beth Shapiro, who is now Colossal's chief science officer and was a co-author of the 2021 paper, says the company's recent work builds on those findings. This time, the scientists were able to extract and sequence DNA from a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull that yielded more complete genomic data than the samples used in the 2021 study. The results, Shapiro says, show the dire wolf was the result of hybridization between two ancient, now extinct canid lineages. Dire wolves' closest modern relatives are wolves, coyotes and dholes, and the new findings suggest they share 99.5 percent of their DNA with gray wolves. That finding is set to be detailed in a paper that will be posted to the preprint server arXiv.org. (Such preprint studies have not yet been peer-reviewed.)

After examining the dire wolf genome, Shapiro and her team edited 20 sites on 14 genes in the genome of the modern gray wolf (Canis lupus), introducing what they say are 15 extinct dire wolf variants. No ancient dire wolf genes themselves were directly inserted into the genome, however. The scientists created embryos that were implanted in surrogate dogs.

Colossal targeted genes that affected phenotype, or the observable characteristics of an organism—in this case, largely its appearance. The company's scientists edited genes that affect fur color and thickness and body size, as well as ear, skull and facial shape. “We're using a morphological species concept,” Shapiro says.

To make something that is genetically identical to an ancient dire wolf through gene editing “is not really possible. We can't create that many edits at once,” she says. “But it's also not the goal.” Instead, Shapiro adds, “we want to create functional versions of extinct species. We don't have to have something that is 100 percent genetically identical.”

The "dire wolves" are being kept on a preserve in an undisclosed location.

Other scientists disagree with this view, however. “This is a designer dog. This is a genetically modified gray wolf,” says Jacquelyn Gill, a paleoecologist at the University of Maine, who has worked with Shapiro in the past but was not involved in this project. “I have more than 14 Neandertal genes in me, and we wouldn't call me a Neandertal.”

The pups “don't have any traits that would allow us to understand the dire wolf any better than we did yesterday,” Gill says, adding that understanding ice age organisms isn't just a matter of knowing what they looked like or what they ate—but also about knowing what they did in those ancient ecosystems. “Some of those things are coded genetically; some of those are cultural” and passed down from generation to generation.

At best, this would be an “incremental step” toward de-extinction, she says. And even if scientists could clone a dire wolf that was completely identical to its extinct ancestor, Gill adds, that would raise a very important question: “What are we going to do with it?”

The wolves created by Colossal are being kept on a large preserve in an undisclosed location somewhere in the northern U.S. Colossal has worked with the American Humane Society to ensure the animals' welfare, and the company says it will be monitoring their health and development.

“There is cool science here, I just wish it wasn't getting lost in hype.”—Gill

It currently has no plans to breed these wolves. For now, it is doing feasibility studies on creating more of the animals to add to the pack—and to perhaps give to Indigenous tribes that Colossal says have expressed interest in keeping the wolves in preserves on tribal land.

But reintroducing dire wolves to the landscape beyond that is difficult to envision, Gill says. The biggest animals alive today were middle-sized during the Pleistocene. “We have downsized planet Earth,” she says, noting that conservationists already struggle to maintain and support populations of large predators, such as gray wolves. “It's hard to imagine a practical application here.”

There is, however, conservation potential in the gene-editing techniques used by the Colossal team—for a different species: the endangered red wolf. Red wolves, once found from Texas to Pennsylvania, saw their numbers nose-dive in the 20th century because of hunting and habitat loss. Declared extinct in the wild in 1980, they were eventually reintroduced using a captive breeding program.

But as with many small, endangered populations, the gene pool is limited. There is work with various species to collect genetic material from skin punches to “biobank” genetic material in order to introduce more diversity into extant populations. Shapiro says Colossal's technique, which uses routine blood draws, yields cells that are easier to reprogram than those that come from skin—and could thus be a better way of diversifying the red wolf gene pool. “It's actually using technology to prevent species from going extinct,” says Matt James, Colossal's chief animal officer.

Gill agrees that this approach is potentially promising. “There is cool science here,” she says. “I just wish it wasn't getting lost in hype.”

What if your mind is shaping the world around you in ways you can't see ... or even imagine?

Ever since we published our very first issue 123 years ago—yes, we're old—Popular Mechanics has endeavored to help you understand all kinds of technological marvels, from the tools in your shed, to the planes in the sky, to the tanks on the battlefield. But lately, we've really tried to dive deep into the world's most complex machine: you.   

Or, more specifically, the thing that makes you you: consciousness.

Discover the most mind-blowing new science stories from Pop Mech Pro!

The question of, “What is consciousness?” is no longer exclusively the realm of ancient philosophers and dorm-room debaters. In the last few years, scientists across all kinds of disciplines have been making remarkable breakthroughs in the study and exploration of consciousness—and PopMech has been along for the ride every step of the way.

We've covered every piece of cutting-edge research that could redefine our entire understanding of ourselves and the world around us. In the process, we've had to ask some mind-bending questions like:

Ready for the answers? We'll unravel these mysteries—and more—together. Just bring an open mind, and prepare to reconsider the very nature of consciousness ... starting with the possibility that it's not just all in your head.  

🤯 Are Your Cells Conscious?

Is consciousness confined to your brain, or does every part of your body contain a kind of consciousness, down to the cellular level? That's what William B. Miller, Ph.D., an evolutionary biologist and physician, is trying to figure out. Miller and his team have proposed ideas that flip Charles Darwin's concept of natural selection on its head, including how consciousness may play a critical part in the way life evolves. 

Miller is among a small, but growing group of scientists who believe that your cells aren't “passive robots that automatically follow a code of instructions, carrying out orders from our genome like mindless drones.” Instead, these scientists think the roughly 37 trillion cells that make up your body are themselves conscious—and that life and consciousness began exactly at the same time.  

This concept of cellular consciousness has gained further credence with the advent of a new class of AI-designed multicellular organisms known as “xenobots.” These are cells that form new roles beyond their original biological function, such as using hairlike cilia for locomotion rather than transporting mucus. This is why scientists like Peter Noble, Ph.D., and Alex Pozhitkov, Ph.D., say that xenobots form a kind of “third state” of life, “wherein cells can reorganize after the death of an organism to form something new.” 

Xenobots, then, could radically alter our understanding of life, where the conscious cell—and not the organism—is the “fundamental unit of biological agency.”

Here's the astonishing truth about these conscious cells, and why they're the next great leap in science.

🤯 Does Consciousness Exist in the Quantum Realm?

Scientists aren't just exploring consciousness in our bodies—they're also searching for it in even weirder, more complex places. 

In recent decades, some experts have developed a theory that says when your brain performs quantum operations, it generates consciousness. One scientist, Michael Pravica, Ph.D., for example, believes that your brain can access hidden dimensions during moments of heightened awareness. (You have to read his explanation for what happens during a “Eureka” moment.) 

We once asked a theoretical physicist, an experimental physicist, and a philosophy professor to weigh in on the controversial concept—sounds like the setup to a joke—and they couldn't come to a consensus on a direct connection between quantum mechanics and consciousness ... yet. 

But these ideas don't have to be purely theoretical; to some degree, they can be put to the test. That was the case with a recent groundbreaking study that suggests Your Consciousness Can Connect With the Whole Universe. 

In the study, scientists administered anesthesia to rats, some of whom also received molecules that stabilized a microscopic part of their brain known as “microtubules,” or hollow tubes that experts believe “perform incredible operations in the quantum realm.” The stabilized rats actually remained conscious for longer, suggesting a tantalizing link between these quantum brain components and the very essence of consciousness itself. 

If this all sounds trippy, you're right—and, as it turns out, taking “trips” on psychedelics might actually unlock new levels of consciousness. 

In a study from Johns Hopkins' Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research, people who used substances like LSD and DMT reported experiencing a connection to an “ultimate reality” and “had a decreased fear of death.” (And here's why some psychedelics even allow some users to “see God.”)

But let's go a step further: What if psychedelics like magic mushrooms aren't just a new way to expand your consciousness? What if they're the very thing that helped shape it?

A research review from the Miguel Lillo Foundation in Argentina concluded that, “psilocybin not only influenced an individual's perceptions while under its effects, but shaped human consciousness as a whole over the thousands of generations that humans had been eating psychedelic fungi.”

We know—that's a lot to take in. And yet, it's just the beginning. Consciousness remains one of the most profound, mind-blowing mysteries in all of science, and we've covered its every twist and turn, including: 

Every day, scientists all over the world are continuing to dive deeper into what makes us who we are. From radical new research to the daring pursuits that push the limits of understanding, there's always more to learn.

Quantum Physics Is on the Wrong Track, Says Breakthrough Prize Winner Gerard 't Hooft

After netting the world's highest-paying science award, preeminent theoretical physicist Gerard 't Hooft reflects on his legacy and the future of physics

In the pantheon of modern physics, few figures can match the quiet authority of Gerard 't Hooft. The Dutch theoretical physicist, now a professor emeritus at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, has spent much of the past half-century reshaping our understanding of the fundamental forces that knit together reality. But 't Hooft's unassuming, soft-spoken manner belies his towering scientific stature, which is better revealed by the mathematical rigor and deep physical insights that define his work—and by the prodigious numbers of prestigious prizes he has accrued, which include a Nobel Prize, a Wolf Prize, a Franklin Medal, and many more.

His latest accolade, announced on April 5, is the most lucrative in all of science: a Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, worth $3 million, in recognition of 't Hooft's myriad contributions to physics across his long career.

His most celebrated discovery—and the one that earned him, along with his former Ph.D. thesis adviser, the late Martinus Veltman, the 1999 Nobel Prize in Physics—showed how to make sense of non-Abelian gauge theories, which are complex mathematical frameworks that describe how elementary particles interact. Together, 't Hooft and Veltman demonstrated that these theories could be renormalized, meaning that intractable infinite quantities that cropped up in calculations could be tamed in a consistent and precise way. This feat would change the course of science history, laying the groundwork for the Standard Model, the reigning paradigm of particle physics.

But beyond this, 't Hooft has made many other breakthroughs, which are too numerous—and, in most cases, too technical—to thoroughly describe here. Among them, however, some of the most notable include his contributions to our understanding of the way that quarks are confined within protons and neutrons and the way that magnetic monopoles naturally emerge from the high-energy unification of fundamental forces, as well as the physics of black holes. In particular, his explorations of the latter area led to his proposal of the holographic principle in the 1990s. This is the notion that all the information within a three-dimensional volume of space can be encoded on a surrounding two-dimensional surface, akin to a hologram. The idea has since become central to many efforts to unify quantum mechanics with Einstein's general theory of relativity in an all-encompassing theory of quantum gravity.

In a conversation with Scientific American, 't Hooft spoke about his Breakthrough Prize, his optimism for the future of particle physics, his dissatisfaction with quantum mechanics, and the scientific and cultural effects that have arisen from some of his most provocative ideas.

[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]

It seems you've won practically all the big physics prizes at this point.

Some are still missing! But, yeah, I've won quite a few prizes. What worries me a little bit is that most of them were for the same thing. You get prize after prize for something that has already been recognized as such, whereas I've done other things in science that are not as well known—not by the general public, at least. But anyway, the Breakthrough Foundation has made a summary of my work for which they gave this prize, and that contains practically everything!

Yes, the foundation included it all! But given how many prizes you have won, does this one feel like just another notch on your belt? Has this all become routine for you, or is it still exciting?

I can assure you: nothing is routine. All these things are different. The climax really was the Nobel Prize itself, which is only granted to a very few people every year. And that's something very special. But this one is also very special. It's a big prize, literally speaking.

And as you mentioned, this one recognizes the full sweep of your scientific career rather than just one facet of it, such as your work in the 1970s with Veltman to explain the electroweak interaction that led to you both sharing the 1999 Nobel Prize in Physics. That work, of course, was fundamental to the subsequent formulation of the Standard Model of particle physics, now celebrated as the most well tested and successful scientific theory ever devised. But in some respects, the Standard Model has become notorious, too, because its many myriad experimental validations have contributed to a crisis in particle physics wherein progress has slowed down as researchers have seen no obvious path forward to further breakthroughs. Does this aspect of the Standard Model's decades-long dominance worry you?

No, not at all. I think it is natural for science that we cannot always have an infinitely continuous stream of discoveries and new insights. There will be periods, like the one we are in now in particle physics, where things seem to be quieter. I just saw the news from CERN, for instance, that at the Large Hadron Collider, they've detected in new channels the absence of CP [charge parity] symmetry. And that's fine. That's not earth-shattering. Nowadays, we're in a period where scientists in my field make many smaller discoveries that, in themselves, are very pleasing because they make our understanding more complete. But I think history shows it won't be always like this.

A few centuries ago, when [James Clerk] Maxwell joined electricity and magnetism, and after that, when Max Planck made the first observations about energy being quantized, there were long periods in which very little seemed to be happening. In reality, of course, many things did happen in other fields, such as statistical physics and other fundamental branches of science. And both then and now, there's been steady progress in those domains. Look at astronomy right now; the astronomers have their great moments all the time, and you can't say there's a dull moment at all! They're discovering many new things in the universe as their telescopes become bigger and more accurate and as they use more and more fundamental scientific techniques to enhance their resolution. You can say much the same thing about biophysics or medicine, where discoveries are made nearly every day.

But in my field, you're right, it seems to be that nothing is happening. I don't agree with that, though. Things are happening, just at a more modest scale.

Are you optimistic, then, that this situation will change, and we'll see a resurgence in big particle physics discoveries?

That's a very good question because it looks as if there's nothing we can do. If the situation proceeds in such a way that every new breakthrough requires a 10-fold, or even larger, increase in the machines' size, power and costs, then clearly we won't get much beyond where we are now. I cannot exclude such obstacles standing in the way of progress, but the history of science suggests, in such a case, progress will simply go in different directions. One may not only think of precision improvements but also [think of] totally different avenues of discovery such as cosmology and black hole physics.

But I would like to advise to the new generation of scientists: don't worry about that, because the real reason why there's nothing new coming is that everybody's thinking the same way!

I'm a bit puzzled and disappointed about this. Many people continue to think the same way—and the way people now try to introduce new theories doesn't seem to work as well. We have lots of new theories about quantum gravity, about statistical physics, about the universe and cosmology, but they're not really “new” in their basic structure. People don't seem to want to make the daring new steps that I think are really necessary. For instance, we see everybody sending their new ideas first to the [preprint server] arXiv.org and then to the journals to have it published. And in arXiv.org, you see thousands of papers coming every year, and none of them really has this great, bright, new, fine kind of insight that changes things. There are insights, of course, but not the ones that are needed to make a basic new breakthrough in our field.

I think we have to start thinking in a different way. And I have always had the attitude that I was thinking in a different way. And particularly in the 1970s, there was a very efficient way of making further progress: think differently from what your friends are doing, and then you find something new!

I think that is still true; however, I'm getting old now and am no longer getting brilliant new ideas every week. But in principle, there are ways—one could argue about quantum mechanics, about cosmology, about biology—that are not the conventional ways of looking at things. And to my mind, people thinking in such novel ways is not happening enough.

Could you give an example of the novelty or difference you're referring to?

Sure. My way of thinking about the world, about physics, about the other disciplines related to physics is that everything should be much more logical, much more direct, much more “down to Earth.”

Many people who write papers on quantum mechanics like to keep some sense of mysticism about it, as if there's something strange, something almost religious about the subject. I think that's totally false. Quantum mechanics is based on a mathematical method used to describe very ordinary physical effects. I think the physical world itself is a very ordinary one that is completely classical. But in this completely classical world, there are still too many things that we don't know today, there are “steps” we're basically missing on our path to deeper understanding.

What sorts of steps?

I'm talking about steps that would exploit the fact that the whole world is very simple and straightforward. The trouble is, the world still appears complicated to us now, which is why we're in this situation.

You already mentioned the Standard Model, this marvelous discovery from the previous century. It's an instructive example because, basically, it's very simple, but if you look at it deeper, you see there's something very important missing. The Standard Model is based on quantum mechanics, and quantum mechanics tells you what happens when particles approach one another and scatter. But they can scatter in many different ways; they have a large number of choices of ways in which they scatter against each other, and the Standard Model doesn't give any sound prediction there. It only gives you statistics. The Standard Model is a fantastic theory that handles the statistics of what things are doing. But the theory never tells you which choice nature makes; it only tells you that these different possibilities are there at a certain probability amplitude. That is the world as we know it. That's how we know how to phrase the laws of nature. But it's not the laws of nature themselves.

What's missing is our understanding as to what it is that sometimes makes a particle go this way, sometimes that way. Well, you can easily argue particles can hit each other at a tiny distance. They don't hit each other directly head-on but hit at some angle, and then they scatter away from some angle. That may be true. But what the theory today is not saying is what I should actually be looking at if two particles approach each other to predict how they'll scatter ahead of time.

Imagine if you knew the way such interactions would go as precisely as you could know what will happen when two grand pianos hit each other. In principle, for the pianos, you could say exactly which wire will hit each other wire; you could predict exactly what happens when two grand pianos collide. Could it be the same with particles? In practice, such predictions for particles are considered to be too hard, and you turn to statistics, and you conclude that your piano particles can scatter in all directions, and that's all there is to be said. Well, for looking at pianos, maybe you can say something more. If you know exactly where and at which angle they will hit each other, you can predict ahead of time how they will scatter. And that should be in our theories of the elementary particles as well—and it isn't.

I'm saying we should start to think in these ways. And people refuse that because they think quantum mechanics is too beautiful to be wrong. Whereas I believe that quantum mechanics is not the right way of ultimately saying what basic laws objects obey when they hit each other.

Incidentally, while I was preparing for this interview, I found a conversation you had in 2013 with one of my predecessors here at Scientific American, George Musser. And one of the things you discussed was the work of physicist John Bell and its implications for the nature of reality. You said that you considered locality to “be an essential ingredient for any simple, ultimate law governing the universe.” It sounds like that's still your view.

Very much, absolutely. I think, in fact, that you can understand and explain quantum mechanics very well if you only assume that the laws are local laws. Let us say what these particles do when they collide is determined by where they are, at that very spot when they hit each other. That is, what happens at other spots in the universe, in principle, should not matter. And if it does matter, then you have what we call “nonlocality.” But nonlocality would be a disaster for most solid scientific theories!

I don't believe nonlocality is necessary. We don't know exactly what to do when two particles collide because we don't know whether particles look like grand pianos or like pure points. But, then again, they can't be pure points because pure points can't do anything. There's something in there, and we should be able to write down all the laws on what's in there, in these particles: How can they collide against each other? And why is it that they sometimes go this way and sometimes go that way? How can they exhibit spin?

We should be able to phrase such things as solid laws, and we are not even close to that. And this is why I think other breakthroughs should still be possible—many of them!—to help us get closer to this level of understanding for particles that we simply don't have today, not even as something approximate.

You know, in my talks with theoretical physicists, I've noticed that the greater and more accomplished the individual is, the more likely they are to say, “The real challenge is not in answering old questions but rather in finding new, better questions for whatever problem you're addressing.” I think that's because there's this temptation for optimism about what can be known—this feeling that by asking the “right” questions, meaningful answers must emerge. Do you really think the problem is that we're not asking the right questions, or is it instead that we've been asking the right ones, and their answers are, against our hopes, simply beyond our reach?

What you just said, that the questions are beyond our reach, is exactly what people said a decade and a century and a millennium ago. And of course, that was the wrong answer each time. We can answer these questions, but to do so requires lots and lots of science. Before Maxwell, nobody understood how exactly electric and magnetic fields hang together, and they thought, “Oh, this is impossible to find out because it's weird!” But then Maxwell said, no, you just need this one term, and then it all straightens out! And now we understand exactly what electric and magnetic interactions do. It's simply not correct that you cannot answer such questions. No, you can, but you have to start from the beginning, like I said about quantum mechanics.

If you believe right from the beginning that quantum mechanics is a theory that only gives you statistical answers and never anything better than that, then I think you're on the wrong track. And people refuse to drop the idea that quantum mechanics is some strange sort of supernatural feature of the particles that we will never understand. No! We will understand, but we need to step backward first, and that's always my message in science in general: before you understand something, just take a few steps back. Maybe you have to make a big march back, all the way back to the beginning.

Just imagine: What would your basic laws possibly be if you didn't have quantum mechanics? Answering that, of course, requires saying what quantum mechanics is.

Okay. So what is quantum mechanics?

Quantum mechanics is the possibility that you can consider superpositions of states. That's really all there is to it. And I'd argue that superpositions of states are not real. If you look very carefully, things never superimpose. [Erwin] Schrödinger asked the right questions here: You know, take my cat, it can be dead; it can be alive. Can it be in a superposition? That's nonsense!

And he was quite right. People shouldn't continue to insist that a dead cat and a live cat superimpose. That's complete nonsense—yet, at that level, it seems to be the only correct answer to say exactly where the particle is, what its velocity is, what its spin is, and so on. Whereas there must be different kinds of variables that evolve in time, such as integer-valued variables or discretely moving variables, to name just two possibilities. These would be variables in terms of which you can't move a cat, you can't say whether it's dead or alive, unless you would make more nonlocal changes. There must be ways to describe all states for alive cats and for dead cats, but these states will mix with states that don't describe cats at all.

Using superpositions is then just a trick that works at first but doesn't get at the states we want to understand. We have to make that step backward.

Walk me through this for a moment. If superpositions are illusory in that they are purely mathematical concepts that have no basis in physical reality, how does that square with the ongoing success of quantum information science and quantum computing, where it seems as if superpositions are a real physical phenomenon that can be leveraged, for instance, to do things that can't be done classically?

Well, I think quantum technology is just what you get if you assume the reality of superimposed systems. What do I mean by that? We know superpositions in the macroscopic world are nonsense. That's clear. And I believe, in the microscopic world, it's clearly nonsense, too, even though it may seem we have nothing besides superpositions to use for understanding atoms. And I think what people in quantum technology probably don't realize is that they're doing the very converse of what they think they are doing. They think they're understanding quantum mechanics. Instead I think what they should be doing is trying to remove the quantum mechanics from the description, trying to use more fundamental degrees of freedom, like those discrete states I mentioned.

They're not asking the right questions, and that failure to do so makes things look more and more complicated—more and more quantum-mechanical—whereas, in reality, it shouldn't be interpreted that way.

Weren't we just discussing the tendency of eminent theorists to talk about not asking the right questions?

Well, let me say that, yes, they do the right experiments. Yes, they try to make the right things. And yes, their quantum computers may be more powerful than anything else for certain applications because they understand “quantum mechanics”—by which I mean they understand how these microscopic systems actually act, in great detail, because this is something that actually came out of studying the quantum world. Yes, we know how small objects react and interact. But our problem is that, at present, we can only make statistical predictions. And as soon as a quantum computer gives you statistical distributions instead of correct answers, well, that's the end of your “computer”; you can't use it for most applications anymore.

For most things, you want to use a computer in such a way that you avoid making superpositions—because you want to get a sharp answer. For instance, you want to decipher a secret code or something like that. You want to have the exact answer: “This is what it means, not that!” And let's not equate this answer to a superposition of those two possibilities—again, that's nonsense.

What I'm saying is: we must unwind quantum mechanics, so to speak, as to see what happens underneath. And until the quantum technologists start doing that, I believe they won't make really big progress. For instance, quantum computers always make errors, and their designers and operators try to correct them. And if you're trying to correct these errors, what that means to me is: you want to go to more basic degrees of freedom that do not ever carry any error in them because they're exact—they're just classical. But to have this realization is apparently very difficult.

This is my feeling as to why we don't make breakthroughs. We should think about things in a different manner.

It seems you're saying we must live in a clockwork universe, one in which things must be purely deterministic at a very fundamental level, and thus there's very little room for any sort of quasi-mystical speculation. And one consequence of that would seem to be the dissolution of mystery, to some degree. You mentioned earlier the stubborn persistence of an almost religious approach to quantum mechanics within the scientific community, not to mention in popular culture. Perhaps this attitude endures because, for so many people, it preserves something ineffable about all that we experience in the world rather than assuming everything can be known by filling in the right equations.

So if you do believe in this sort of clockwork universe, I wonder what you'd say its most mysterious aspect would be.

Well, there are still many mysteries that make our problem very, very difficult. And this deterministic universe we discuss is something that could only be fully understood by someone with a much bigger mind, a much bigger brain, than I have because they'll have to consider all possibilities. And as soon as you make some wrong assumption, then you again get this quantum-mechanical situation in which things get to superimpose each other.

A simpler question is: Can you formulate quantum mechanics without a superposition principle? And my answer is yes. And in one of my last [preprint] papers on arXiv.org, I wrote a little simple model—too simple to be useful in a real world. But the model is just a clock, a clock that has a pendulum that moves in a very organized way, and that pendulum drives a wheel that shows the time, the hands that show the minutes and seconds. And because of this, I call it my grandfather's clock model. And from the pendulum, you can derive what time the hand should show. And these hands are deterministic. They are just showing a time with infinite precision, say. And the pendulum is really a quantum pendulum; it can be quantized; we can write quantum equations for it.

I found the connection to the mathematics of this pendulum and the mathematics of this hand that shows the time. Keep in mind, the hand that shows the time is completely classical, and the pendulum is completely quantum-mechanical, but one is related to the other—it's just one machine.

But I got very few reactions to this. I would have thought that people would say, “Oh, yes, of course. Now we understand how to continue!” But instead they've said, “Okay, right, 't Hooft has another hot idea, another crazy idea. And he has many of those crazy ideas. Let him be happy with it; we're going to do our own thing.” And that's the most common reaction I've gotten.

I'd suspect the reasons for that reaction are, in some sense, not scientific and rather more “cultural,” right? I'm thinking of this in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio that exists for anyone trying to drink from the firehose of new preprint papers on arXiv.org and elsewhere. It can be very tough to know what to pay attention to and how to evaluate whatever does get one's attention. 

That leads me to one more question. I'm curious how you feel about the cultural impacts of your scientific contributions, in particular the holographic principle, which you first proposed in the early 1990s.

Arguably because of this idea, there are people—mostly nonscientists, I'd imagine—who truly believe that the cosmos is in fact within a black hole or that it's all some simulation in a higher-dimensional computer. The idea being for this “simulation hypothesis” that perhaps nothing is “real” besides information itself, as everything else could just be a projection of patterns of 1's and 0's encoded on the outermost boundary of the observable universe. I wonder what you think about this phenomenon in which you put forth a provocative theoretical insight more than 30 years ago, and it has somehow led to the world's richest man seriously suggesting on a popular podcast that “we are most likely” all just avatars in some cosmic-scale video game.

Well, I do have some reservations. Maybe I should have never talked about the holographic principle because, yes, some people are galloping away into nonsense, linking this idea with supernatural features and poorly defined dimensionality, all to sound very mysterious. And I have a big problem with that. I think you shouldn't phrase the laws of nature in more complicated terms than strictly necessary. You should simplify as much as possible. Even Einstein once said something like this, that you have to simplify things as much as possible but not beyond reality, not beyond the truth. We should try not to be supernatural; if we, as scientists, only leave a wake of mysteries behind us, we're not doing the right thing.

I am a bit worried that the holographic principle has only invited people to be more mysterious because I want the extreme opposite. I want people to try to be super rational. For me, even quantum mechanics is already too far away from reason. And you know, if you rephrase quantum mechanics to treat Hilbert space [a type of vector space that allows for infinite dimensions] as something used for practical purposes rather than Hilbert space being a fundamental property of nature, you don't even need this sort of holography anymore! I wish more people understood that. We have to try to phrase things more precisely to avoid public misunderstandings wreaking havoc on science.

People Likely Aren't as Susceptible to False Memories as Researchers Thought

New studies underscore the difficulty of implanting entirely fictional events in a person's recollection

By Bernice Andrews & Chris R. Brewin

How much can we trust our memories? We know that our mind keeps an imperfect record of the past. We can forget or misremember details with frustrating consequences. Our attention can be diverted in ways that make it all too easy to miss key events.

But a particularly disturbing idea suggests that we readily form false memories—that is, we can become convinced we experienced something that never actually occurred. This concept is often used to cast doubt on the reliability of a plaintiff's testimony in a court case, suggesting it is easy to create false memories of entire events. For example, lawyers representing Harvey Weinstein cited this idea to raise questions about several women's allegations against him.

Recently we had the opportunity to take a closer look at this concept by analyzing data from a study that intended to replicate one of the most iconic experiments on false memories to date.

The experiment was published by American psychologists Elizabeth Loftus and Jacqueline Pickrell in 1995. Decades earlier, Loftus had demonstrated that people's memories of visual details could be manipulated by posing questions that contained misinformation. She then wanted to see whether it was possible to implant an entire false memory for a childhood event that had never happened. To that end, in the 1995 study, she and Pickrell misled participants into believing that, according to their parents or older sibling, around age five, they had been lost in a shopping mall and then found by an older woman.

Over the course of two sessions, the researchers strongly encouraged 24 participants to remember and describe all they could about this experience (which the parents or older sibling denied had actually happened). The experimenters evaluated the participants' responses and concluded that one quarter of them had been led to remember the suggested fake event either partially or fully. Loftus had previously claimed some therapists could implant false memories of childhood sexual abuse in their clients. Her “lost in the mall” experiment therefore offered evidence that such a thing might be possible. Over the years, other scientists have implanted false memories of events, such as knocking over a punch bowl at a wedding, traveling in a hot air balloon or putting Slime in a teacher's desk.

In a 2017 paper we identified two big questions that have been hanging over these studies. The first is: How confident can we be in the experimenters' false memory judgments? For example, would the participants themselves agree that they not only believed in the false event on their relative's say-so but had an actual memory of it? And secondly, what exactly was it that the participants remembered? Could some of those recollections have been true memories? And what does a “partial” false memory consist of? Our new analysis digs into these questions and suggests that the body of research on false memory induction must be treated with caution: it is likely much more difficult to convince someone of a false memory than past work has suggested.

In 2023 Irish psychologist Gillian Murphy and her colleagues closely repeated the “lost in the mall” study, following the original methods. They used a larger sample of 123 people and reported that 35 percent of participants had a false memory, 10 percent more than in the original study. When asked, however, less than half (14 percent) of these participants agreed they had a memory of the fake event.

Murphy's team's data and transcriptions of what participants actually said were made freely available to other researchers, reflecting a move toward greater transparency in psychological research. We were impressed by this open approach to science, which is the only way to establish whether the claims made for memory implantation stand up to the scrutiny of independent researchers. For the first time, it was possible to examine what was really going on.

Before reanalyzing their data, we broke the suggested “lost in the mall” story down into its six core elements. These were that the person was around age five, was lost for an extended period, had cried, was found by an older woman, and was reunited with their family and that this event occurred in the specifically suggested shopping location.

To our surprise, none of the participants in the replication study remembered all six elements. Those rated as having a full false memory recalled fewer than three of the details on average, while those described as having a partial false memory recalled about one detail. Even more strikingly, 20 percent of those with a full memory and 60 percent of those with a partial memory did not explicitly remember the defining detail of being lost.

We also found that half of those judged to have a false memory had actually been lost before or experienced a similarly analogous situation but not in a way suggested by the experimenters. In all cases, these participants described real events that they clearly distinguished from the suggested fake event. One participant said, “My memory is completely different to the other [suggested] memory.” Another said, “I don't really remember that one.... But like me getting lost in the shop was like a regular occurrence.” Others were so uncertain about the suggested details in the fake story that their testimony would have little value in court. One participant commented, “I don't even know if I ever did get lost in the shop before so I'm not sure if it's completely constructed or whether it's the right memory.”

Taking everything into account, we estimated that only five participants could reasonably be claimed to have a false memory rather than the 43 that were originally claimed. The participants were clearly very engaged by the study and approached the task of weighing up what, if anything, they remembered about the suggested event in a sophisticated way. Their comments revealed, for example, that they compared the scenario with other episodes of being lost, thinking about who would have been present and considering if the mall was as suggested. Labeling their musings as a false memory does not capture these important aspects of their experience.

Our findings raise serious questions about claims made in court that it is easy to implant entire false memories in others. The great majority of these so-called false memories were much more limited, and held with much less conviction, than the claims made about this type of experiment led us to expect. While these questions remain, psychologists should be very cautious about how they present the findings on memory implantation to others. It is easy to overstate the relevance or generalizability of scientific evidence.

Nonpsychologists can take comfort in these findings. Though memory is limited and sometimes mistaken, completely false memories are not easy to implant. Most of the time, memory does a good enough job. And while it is valuable to bring critical distance and skepticism when considering the reliability of memory—particularly in legal contexts—we should not be too quick to throw out a person's testimony simply because it could be imperfect.

An Experimental Eye-Color-Changing Surgery Is Gaining Popularity—Here's What We Know about It

A new surgical procedure to permanently change eye color is gaining traction in the U.S. But many ophthalmologists fear long-term unknowns

By Saima S. Iqbal edited by Lauren J. Young

Some people who have always wanted a different eye color, like this vibrant green shade above, are considering a new surgery called cosmetic keratopigmentation to permanently change them.

Sergey Pristyazhnyuk/Alamy Stock Photo

Carol Miranda paid a surgeon in Los Angeles thousands of dollars last year to permanently change her eye color from dark brown to hazel.

Miranda, a now 49-year-old sales associate, had dreamed since childhood of having hazel or green eyes. For decades she'd worn colored contacts and admired how the lenses “softened” her facial features. She sometimes wore them to bed or the beach despite doctors' warnings. Then, in 2022, she learned of an experimental procedure called cosmetic keratopigmentation—which claimed to offer the effect of colored contacts sans the fuss.

For the procedure, Miranda lay flat on an operating table opposite a large, machine-guided laser. Speculums bared her eyes wide as numbing drops desensitized the tissues. Her surgeon directed the laser to dig donut-shaped channels into each of her corneas, the clear outer coverings of the eyes. Using various handheld tools, the doctor then adjusted the edges of these channels and filled them with dye. In under 20 minutes and with minimal discomfort, the transformation was complete: Miranda's honey-colored eyes looked “surprisingly natural,” she says.

Developed in small clinics in Spain and France in the 2010s, cosmetic keratopigmentation quietly entered the U.S. in 2019. Today just a handful of ophthalmologists in the country offer the procedure, and it is performed “off-label,” or at their professional discretion, without the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's explicit approval or supervision. Yet public demand has recently surged, in part because of viral social media videos. Miranda's surgeon and corneal specialist, Brian Boxer Wachler, has performed hundreds ofcosmetic keratopigmentation procedures since adding it to his practice in early 2024. Another well-established practitioner, Alexander Movshovich, told the Wall Street Journal last November that he was on track to perform more than 400 surgeries in 2024. The rise of cosmetic keratopigmentation has alarmed some ophthalmologists, who argue that the procedure is too risky to be readily available.

Clients' motivations range as widely as custom eye color options, which span the natural spectrum from icy blue to hazel. Some, like Miranda, believe different colors better suit their appearance. Others, Boxer Wachler says, find solace in having an eye color that resembles a family member's, living or deceased. After receiving their new eye color, “I've had patients be giddy with laughter or cry of happiness,” Boxer Wachler says.

In September 2024, surgeon Boxer Wachler transformed this client's eye color from brown to a “medium-intensity evergreen.”

In the early 2000s, people interested in similar cosmetic transformations often turned to iris implantation, an invasive and dangerous off-label operation then available in a few countries outside of the U.S. But iris implantation routinely causes chronic inflammation, glaucoma, cataracts and vision loss. By contrast, proponents of cosmetic keratopigmentation liken the newer procedure to LASIK (laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis), a widely approved procedure for correcting visual problems. Both LASIK and keratopigmentation procedures are generally quick, painless and easy to recover from. (At around $6,000 per eye, however, cosmetic keratopigmentation costs more than twice that of LASIK.)

In December 2024, Boxer Wachler transformed another client's eye color from brown to a “medium-intensity emerald green.”

Early studies indeed suggest that serious adverse effects of cosmetic keratopigmentation are rare, and practitioners market the surgery as safe. But many ophthalmologists emphasize that research on the procedure features small sample sizes and short follow-ups, leaving crucial questions about long-term effects. And they fear that people may not be able to make an adequately informed decision because they lack a full understanding of risks. For example, Miranda says she had assumed the operation was approved by the FDA. In fact, it is not standardized or regulated by any American medical organization.

“I tell my students, ‘You want to be on the cutting edge, not the bleeding edge,'” says Roberto Pineda, a corneal specialist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear. “Cosmetic keratopigmentation currently lacks scientific rigor.”

In January 2024 the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), the world's largest association of eye doctors, warned consumers that both iris implantation and cosmetic keratopigmentation “carry serious risks for vision loss and complications.” The latter surgery could inflame or damage the cornea, the association said. Scarring of the cornea may also occur from potential infection. The dye might also leach out of its channels, potentially affecting other structures of the eye.

Boxer Wachler, Movshovich and two doctors who pioneered cosmetic keratopigmentation promptly wrote to the academy, urging it to withdraw its warning and citing research they felt demonstrated the procedure's safety. The academy has stood by its statement, says AAO spokesperson Thomas Steinemann, an ophthalmologist at MetroHealth.

Boxer Wachler says few lasting adverse effects have been reported in the procedure's medical literature. The largest study of outcomes to date, published in 2018, surveyed 204 people who'd undergone keratopigmentation in the past four months to 12-plus years. Of the 29 people who developed complications, 49 percent suffered light sensitivity that tended to resolve after six months; 19 percent saw their new eye color fade or change; and 4 and 2 percent, respectively, experienced slight visual field limitations or pain in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines. A 2021 study conducted by some of the same co-authors, who surveyed 40 cosmetic keratopigmentation clients two and a half years after their operation, reported similar but less frequent complications. The authors of that study wrote in their paper that this shift reflected advancements in technique. More recent research documented five cosmetic keratopigmentation recipients who later developed ectasia, a corneal bulge that can distort vision without treatment.

Visual field changes may arise because the procedure can flatten the dome of the cornea, Boxer Wachler explains. And if a person later has an MRI, swelling and burning of the eye can occur if the machine's powerful magnetic field interacts with trace colorant metals in the new pigment. The FDA does not regulate such pigments, raising the risk of contamination by bacteria or damaging materials, including certain colorant metals.

Boxer Wachler clarified he does not use pigments containing metals, though he declined to specify his dyes' ingredients or sources. He and Movshovich say they've pioneered techniques to remove some of a client's dye if needed, but the pigment generally persists in eyes. The removal techniques are mostly used to modify the intensity of a client's new color or to swap it out for another hue.

To better assess the long-term health risks and safety of a new procedure, ophthalmologists generally prefer to follow people over a minimum of 30 years, says Diane Hilal-Campo, a private-practice ophthalmologist and member of the AAO. Some serious complications build gradually, as with iris implantation, she notes.

Cosmetic keratopigmentation surgeons may be able to extrapolate from the 25-year history of the procedure's therapeutic counterpart: medical keratopigmentation. This treatment, also performed off-label, is an option for people born without irises or missing parts of them, which causes serious visual glare that can make daytime activities such as driving difficult or painful; in medical keratopigmentation, surgeons inject dye over missing regions of the iris to help block excessive light. Pineda, who began performing the therapeutic procedure in the late 1990s, notes that reports of side effects are limited but can include pigment fading and, in rare circumstances, spreading.

A decades-long randomized controlled trial with hundreds or thousands of people who have received cosmetic keratopigmentation could best help doctors understand the procedure's long-term implications. But the logistics would likely be too expensive or burdensome for test subjects, says ophthalmologist Kevin Miller of UCLA Health. Doctors who perform the surgery can voluntarily document people's reports of severe complications or conduct limited survey-based studies—but they are not required to. Under current law, the recipient is ultimately liable for any benefits or burdens the procedure brings.

Boxer Wachler says he declines to operate on people with a history of LASIK, eye inflammation, present or prior autoimmune conditions or other conditions that might raise the risk of complications. He treats clients at risk for glaucoma on a case-by-case basis. Steinemann advises anyone with a strong family history of eye disease to steer clear of the procedure, noting that it might obstruct surgeries needed to treat any future conditions. Boxer Wachler encourages prospective cosmetic keratopigmentation receivers to seek out experienced providers for the safest and most natural-looking results.

Many ophthalmologists recommend that people interested in changing their eye color stick to colored contacts—a cheaper option they say poses minimal risk when used appropriately. Wearing poorly fitted or dirty contacts or regularly sleeping, showering or swimming with them can cause serious complications, such as corneal ulcers or potentially blinding infections. The AAO urges consumers to get their cosmetic contact fittings, prescriptions and use instructions from eye care professionals.

“I'd ask people to remember,” Steinemann says, “that with your eyes, you don't get a second chance.”

There's unexpected movement in the world of cell biology — specifically, with the energy factories known as mitochondria.

Ever since they were discovered in the mid-nineteenth century, mitochondria have been known as organelles that reside inside cells. But that textbook picture now seems to be wrong. An explosion of research is challenging mitochondria's long-standing image as exclusively cellular organelles. “They may be a multicellular organelle,” says Jonathan Brestoff, an immunologist who studies metabolism at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. In other words, the supposedly static energy factories now seem to be expert travellers, skipping from one cell to another on demand.

Cancer cells ‘poison' the immune system with tainted mitochondria

Cancer cells ‘poison' the immune system with tainted mitochondria

This ‘mitochondrial transfer' has been observed in a wide variety of cells and in organisms as diverse as yeast, molluscs and rodents. “It's really exciting to see,” says Jeffrey Spees, a stem-cell biologist at the University of Vermont in Burlington.

It's not yet clear why mitochondria are so mobile. Some studies have hinted that cells donate their mitochondria to their neighbours during times of need. In cellular emergencies, newly arrived mitochondria might kick-start tissue repair, fire up the immune system or rescue distressed cells from death. Other research suggests that mitochondrial transfer can be a lethal weapon that cancer cells deploy to gain an advantage.

But what this means for human health is still a mystery. Researchers haven't yet captured the process inside the human body and so don't know for sure if it happens in people, says Daniel Davis, an immunologist at Imperial College London. “We don't have the technology yet to witness this happening,” he says.

That fact hasn't stopped researchers from exploring how to leverage mitochondrial transfer to treat a variety of diseases, including cancer and stroke.

Over the past three decades, research has revealed that mitochondria are much more than cellular powerhouses that turn nutrients from food into energy. They're key players in multiple processes in the body: they guide the chatter that keeps cells functioning and contribute to the immune response against harmful invaders. They're also unexpectedly diverse. Last year, researchers found that mitochondria divide themselves into two distinct forms to help cells survive nutrient starvation1. Another study, published in March, modelled the density and type of mitochondria throughout the human brain2.

All mitochondria — in whatever organism, in whatever part of the body — are thought to have sprung from the same ancient bacterium. Around 1.5 billion years ago, this drifting bacterium was swallowed up by the microbe that eventually gave rise to eukaryotes — the large group of organisms, including us, whose cells have an enclosed nucleus.

After several evolutionary twists and turns, this borrowed bacterium became the organelle that drives metabolism. Mitochondria's microbial origins probably help to explain why they are more dynamic than they first appear, says Kazuhide Hayakawa, a neuroscientist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who studies how mitochondrial transfer could help to treat stroke. “It is possible that mitochondria retain the ancient ability to spread from cell to cell, like bacteria,” he says.

In 2006, Spees and his colleagues captured the first glimpse of mitochondria skipping from one cell to another3. The team had been trying to understand a perplexing behaviour of stem cells in laboratory dishes. These cells seemed to be sharing some kind of physical information that told them how to differentiate, and mitochondria were thought to be involved.

To investigate mitochondria's role, the researchers cultured human lung cancer cells, which lacked the organelles, with stem cells sourced from bone marrow. With the stem cells' mitochondria tagged with fluorescent proteins, the team shot a time-lapse video of what happened next.

The grainy black and white footage showed the stem cells shooting out their mitochondria, which were then taken up by the defective lung cells. After the donation, the lung cells quickly recovered their ability to divide and transform glucose into energy. “Watching it was like a miracle,” says Spees.

Since then, researchers have observed mitochondria zipping between several types of cell — lung, heart, brain, fat, bone and more. Sometimes the mitochondria are travelling down ephemeral highways known as tunnelling nanotubes that form between cells and transport other cellular cargo. In other cases, the mitochondria take their journey in bubble-shaped vesicles or float freely in blood4 (see ‘Three ways to go').



How mitochondria are getting around is largely settled, but what's less clear is why. Researchers are learning that the process is often a form of cellular damage control, says Clair Crewe, a cell biologist at Washington University.

Some studies suggest, for example, that mitochondrial transfer might help cells to weather neurological storms. In 2016, Hayakawa and his colleagues found that in mice that have had a stroke, support cells called astrocytes deliver their mitochondria to faltering neurons. With this mitochondrial boost, neurons grew branches and restarted their metabolic processes, which improved their chances of survival. When the researchers inhibited mitochondrial transfer, fewer neurons survived, suggesting the donated organelles were key to the cells' recovery5. But which part of the mitochondria's structure or function protected the cells remains unknown, says Hayakawa.

Lung cells might also benefit from a mitochondrial boost during a crisis, says Jahar Bhattacharya at Columbia University in New York City, who specializes in a severe inflammatory condition known as acute lung injury. He and his colleagues have found that in mice with this inflammation, stromal cells — which make up connective tissues that support organs — transfer their mitochondria to lung cells6. Cells with loaned organelles had higher concentrations of the cellular fuel ATP, which ended up being distributed to nearby cells that did not receive new mitochondria.

These diseased lungs showed more signs of recovery than did diseased lungs that didn't receive outside mitochondria. Bhattacharya was amazed when he and his team witnessed mitochondrial transfer in action. “I don't think we slept for the next few nights, it was so exciting,” he says.

Other research hints that transferred mitochondria might supercharge wound healing. In 2021, Anne-Marie Rodriguez, a cell biologist at Sorbonne University in Paris, and her colleagues found that platelets isolated from human blood shuttled their mitochondria to stem cells when researchers put the two cell types into a dish together. After taking up the mitochondria, the stem cells released molecules that play a part in forming new blood vessels. When the cells were placed onto skin wounds in mice, those injuries healed faster than did injuries in rodents that had received either stem cells or platelets alone7.

Researchers suspect that cells with dysfunctional mitochondria might even have ways to request healthy mitochondria from their neighbours, although the exact mechanisms underlying this process remain murky. “We're only beginning to understand the signalling that's involved,” says Crewe.

Beyond its role in recovery, researchers want to know whether mitochondrial transfer is an essential part of everyday biology. Initial evidence suggests it might help to maintain healthy tissues. Last year, Minghao Zheng, a regenerative biologist at the University of Western Australia in Perth, and his colleagues discovered that some types of astrocyte donate their mitochondria to cells that line blood vessels in the mouse brain8. When the researchers disrupted this process, the blood–brain barrier became leaky, suggesting that mitochondrial transfer helps to maintain this protective membrane shield. Zheng and his team had already reported that mitochondrial transfer in the bones of mice can accelerate the formation of new blood vessels9.

In healthy mice, Brestoff and his colleagues reported, white fat cells transfer their mitochondria to macrophages — white blood cells that hoover up cellular debris. The number of shuttled organelles was reduced in obese mice. The obese mice also burnt less energy than their healthy counterparts10. These organelles might help macrophages to function when their metabolism is disrupted, says Brestoff.

In the labyrinthine world of the immune system, donated mitochondria might have an anti-inflammatory effect, especially when they are taken up by T cells — white blood cells that stave off infections and disease. In studies in cell cultures, Patricia Alejandra Luz-Crawford, an immunologist at the University of the Andes in Santiago, Chile, and her colleagues found that some types of T cell that receive mitochondria from stem cells produce fewer inflammatory molecules. Stem cells cultured from people with rheumatoid arthritis pass fewer mitochondria along to T cells than do stem cells from healthy individuals, which she says might contribute to the chronic inflammation associated with the disease11.

But there are many unanswered questions about mitochondrial transfer, including what the organelles might be doing after they enter cells and how long they last, says Luz-Crawford. “There's still a lot of mystery.”

The lack of detail about why cells transfer their mitochondria makes it hard to know what specific role these cellular exchanges might have in conditions such as cardiovascular disease and obesity, says Rodriguez. In vivo studies have tracked mitochondria in only a handful of tissue types, making it difficult to build a bigger picture of the wider impacts these transfers have on health.

Metrics details

The chicken is a valuable model for understanding fundamental biology and vertebrate evolution and is a major global source of nutrient-dense and lean protein. Despite being the first non-mammalian amniote to have its genome sequenced, a systematic characterization of functional variation on the chicken genome remains lacking. Here, we integrated bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from 7,015 samples, single-cell RNA-seq data from 127,598 cells and 2,869 whole-genome sequences to present a pilot atlas of regulatory variants across 28 chicken tissues. This atlas reveals millions of regulatory effects on primary expression (protein-coding genes, long non-coding RNA and exons) and post-transcriptional modifications (alternative splicing and 3′-untranslated region alternative polyadenylation). We highlighted distinct molecular mechanisms underlying these regulatory variants, their context-dependent behavior and their utility in interpreting genome-wide associations for 39 chicken complex traits. Finally, our comparative analyses of gene regulation between chickens and mammals demonstrate how this resource can facilitate cross-species gene mapping of complex traits.

(b) Functional enrichment analysis of tissue-specific genes using the Gene Ontology (GO) database. (c) Number of tissue-specific genes associated with at least one epigenetic regulator in the respective tissue. The annotation of epigenetic regulators was retrieved from Pan et al.14. (d) Proportion of tissue-specific genes linked to at least one regulator (Regulator-specific) across tissues. (e) Differentially expressed liver genes (n = 327, shown at x-axis) by sex. Genes were identified according to expression differences between males and females. Each bar represents a gene being tested. (f) Ideogram depicting the chromosomal locations of 17 genes (triangles) exhibiting sex-biased expression across 18 tissues. The color scale represents gene density within a 1 Mb window.

Metrics details

Effective countermeasures against the adverse cardiovascular effects of circadian misalignment, such as effects experienced due to night work or jet lag, remain to be established in humans. Here, we aim to test whether eating only during daytime can mitigate such adverse effects vs. eating during the night and day (typical for night shift workers) under simulated night work (secondary analysis of NCT02291952). This single-blind, parallel-arm trial randomized 20 healthy participants (non-shift workers) to simulated night work with meals consumed during night and day (Nighttime Meal Control Group) or only during daytime (Daytime Meal Intervention Group). The primary outcomes were pNN50 (percentage consecutive heartbeat intervals >50 ms), RMSSD (root mean square of successive heartbeat differences), and LF/HF (low/high cardiac frequency). The secondary outcome was blood concentrations of prothrombotic factor plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). These measures were assessed under Constant Routine conditions, before (baseline) and after (postmisalignment) simulated night work. The meal timing intervention significantly modified the impact of simulated night work on cardiac vagal modulation and PAI-1 (pFDR = 0.001). In the Control Group, the postmisalignment Constant Routine showed a decrease in pNN50 by 25.7% (pFDR = 0.008) and RMMSD by 14.3% (pFDR = 0.02), and an increase in LF/HF by 5.5% (pFDR = 0.04) and PAI-1 by 23.9% (pFDR = 0.04), vs. the baseline Constant Routine. In the Intervention Group, there were no significant changes in these outcomes. For exploratory outcomes, the intervention significantly modified the impact of simulated night work on blood pressure (P < 0.05), with no significant change in the Control Group, and a significant reduction by 6-8% (P < 0.01) in the Intervention Group; without significant effects for heart rate or cortisol. These findings indicate that daytime eating, despite mistimed sleep, may mitigate changes in cardiovascular risk factors and offer translational evidence for developing a behavioral strategy to help minimize the adverse changes in cardiovascular risk factors in individuals exposed to circadian misalignment, such as shift workers.

Shift work is prevalent worldwide, with ~15% of the workforce performing night shift work in industrialized countries1, and it increases the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD)2,3,4,5,6,7. For instance, longer duration of night shift work was associated with increased coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in individuals followed over 24 years8. Importantly, this increased risk cannot be fully explained by differences in lifestyle and socioeconomic status9. Such observations highlight the urgent need to understand the underlying mechanisms and develop evidence-based countermeasures to mitigate these adverse health effects. Circadian misalignment, the misalignment between the central circadian pacemaker and the behavioral sleep/wake cycle (typical in shift workers) causes negative cardiometabolic changes10,11,12,13,14.

The adverse effects of circadian misalignment on cardiovascular risk factors in humans can be determined using stringently controlled laboratory protocols, including Forced Desynchrony (FD) and simulated shift work protocols15. In a FD protocol, in which participants were exposed to seven 28-h “days” under dim light (<3 lx), waketime blood pressure was higher during circadian misalignment. These misalignment-induced effects on blood pressure were not explained by changes in waketime heart rate, cortisol, nor sympathoadrenal measures (e.g., urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine), which remained unchanged11. While FD protocols provide experimental evidence for the adverse circadian misalignment effects on cardiovascular function, its translational value may be limited because shift workers do not live on 28-h “days”. Therefore, simulated shift work protocols offer a closer approximation to what shift workers typically experience while controlling for behavioral/environmental factors that directly affect cardiovascular function. For instance, a randomized crossover clinical trial showed that circadian misalignment increased 24-h systolic and diastolic blood pressure. At the same time, it decreased waketime cardiac vagal modulation (e.g., pNN50, percentage of consecutive heartbeat intervals differing by >50 ms, and RMSSD, root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats)16. These experimental human studies indicate that exposure to circadian misalignment may act as an underlying mechanism for the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in shift workers17. Since shift work is not foreseen to disappear, treatment interventions against the long-term adverse cardiovascular events are urgently needed. Preclinical work indicates that a well-consolidated 24-hour cycle of feeding and fasting can sustain cardiac health18. Food access limited to daytime protected against cardiac tissue aging in flies on either a normal or a fat-supplemented diet. Therefore, circadian organization is fundamental for normal health and longevity, while circadian disruption is implicated in the etiology of cardiac disease. Despite these recent breakthroughs, effective countermeasures against adverse cardiovascular effects due to circadian misalignment remain to be established in humans.

Here, we aim to identify whether circadian alignment of eating (despite the mistiming of sleep and of other behaviors) prevents the adverse effects of circadian misalignment on cardiovascular risk factors.

Healthy participants [7 females, 12 males; age: 26.5 ± 4.1 y; body-mass index: 22.7 ± 2.1 kg/m2] (Table 1) underwent a randomized single-blind parallel clinical trial (Fig. 1) consisting of a 14-day circadian laboratory protocol to test the effects of simulated night work with either nighttime and daytime or only daytime eating on circadian rhythms of cardiovascular function compared to simulated day work (Fig. 2). No important harms nor unintended adverse effects were observed in the meal timing groups. The simulated night work was induced using a Forced Desynchrony protocol (FD; four 28-h “days”, see Methods). In the Nighttime Meal Control (NMC) Group, participants had a typical 28-h FD protocol with all behaviors scheduled across a 28-h cycle, including the fasting/eating cycle, which resulted in meals consumed during the daytime and nighttime (typical among shift workers). In the Daytime Meal Intervention (DMI) Group, participants underwent a modified 28-h FD protocol, with all behaviors scheduled on a 28-h cycle, except for the fasting/eating cycle, which was scheduled according to a 24-h cycle, resulting in meals consumed only during the daytime. We assessed the cardiovascular outcomes during Constant Routine protocols (CR, i.e., at least 32-hours of constant wakefulness, semi-recumbent posture, dim light conditions [<3 lx], and hourly isocaloric snacks19), before (baseline CR) and after simulated night work (post-misalignment CR). The CR approach allowed disentangling the contribution of the endogenous circadian control from the acute effects of fasting/eating, sleep/wake, rest/activity, body posture, and dark/light cycles. Because the effects of behaviors and environment are minimized during the CR protocol, it is ideally suited to assess the cardiovascular outcomes, which could have otherwise been affected during the FD study segment. Throughout the baseline and post-misalignment CR protocols, we repeatedly assessed cardiac vagal modulation by heart rate variability analyses (pNN50, RMSSD, LF/HF ratio, which are sensitive to circadian misalignment effects14), circulating concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1, a key prothrombotic factor under circadian control20), blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma cortisol.

The clinical trial flow chart depicts the number of participants in the screening, allocation, and data analyses.

The 14-day stringently controlled circadian laboratory study included a parallel-design, randomized controlled trial with participants randomized to the Nighttime Meal Control (NMC) group or the Daytime Meal Intervention (DMI) group (see SI appendix for details). The study design is presented in relative clock time (for a participant with a habitual wake-up time of 7 a.m.).

Our results showed that the meal timing intervention significantly modified the impact of simulated night work on pNN50 (cosinor mixed-model analyses; meal timing group vs. pre/post simulated night work interaction: pFDR = 0.008). The pNN50 levels decreased in the NMC group by 25.7% after exposure to simulated night work (post-misalignment CR), compared to that before (i.e., baseline CR) (95% confidence intervals [CI], −33.9% to −17.5%; Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test adjusted for multiple comparisons, P = 0.001; Fig. 3A). Conversely, no significant change was observed in the DMI group (95% CI, −8.9% to 4.9%; P = 0.23; Fig. 3B). Similarly, the meal timing intervention significantly modified the impact of simulated night work on RMSSD (cosinor mixed-model analyses; meal timing group vs. pre/post simulated night work intervention: pFDR = 0.02). The RMSSD levels significantly decreased in the NMC group by 14.3% (95% CI, −18.4% to −10.1%; P = 0.001; Fig. 3C), after simulated night work compared to baseline. Conversely, no significant change was observed in the DMI group (95% CI, −2.1% to 2.2%; P = 0.31; Fig. 3D). Likewise, the meal timing intervention significantly modified the impact of simulated night work on LF/HF (i.e., the ratio of low frequency and high cardiac frequency heart rate variability, a measure to estimate cardiac autonomic modulation) (cosinor mixed-model analyses; meal timing group vs. pre/post simulated night work interaction: pFDR = 0.04). The LF/HF ratio levels significantly increased in the NMC group by 5.5% (95%CI, 3.5% to 6.9%; P = 0.03; Fig. 3E), after simulated night work compared to baseline. Conversely, no significant change was observed in the DMI group (95% CI, −0.3% to 1.7%; P = 0.29; Fig. 3F). Of note, the meal timing intervention did not significantly modify the impact of simulated night work on the endogenous circadian rhythms (i.e., circadian phase and amplitude) of pNN50, RMSSD, and LF/HF ratio (cosinor mixed-model analyses; interaction of meal timing group, pre/post simulated night work, and circadian effect: pFDR = 0.34).

The meal timing intervention significantly modified the impact of simulated night work on pNN50 (A, B), RMSSD (C, D), LF/HF (E, F) and PAI-1 (G, H) levels. For all results, cosinor mixed-model analyses were used, and the interaction of meal timing group vs. pre/post simulated night work is reported in the figures. Cosine curves make use of precise circadian phase of each measurement for each participant. Circles indicate data grouped into 15°-circadian windows (~1-hour resolution, except for PAI-1 that is presented with 2-h resolution) with SEM error bars and the top x axes were scaled to the approximate group-averaged clock time of the circadian CBT minimum (reflected by 0o) for reference (i.e., relative clock time). Data correspond to the average (mean ± SEM) across participants per pre/post simulated night work condition and per meal timing group (n = 10 in the NMC group and n = 9 in the DMI group).

The meal timing intervention significantly modified the impact of simulated night work on circulating PAI-1 concentrations (cosinor mixed-model analyses; meal timing group vs. pre/post simulated night work interaction: pFDR = 0.02). The PAI-1 concentrations significantly increased in the NMC group by 23.9% (95%CI, −2.3% to −45.6%; P = 0.001; Fig. 3G), after simulated night work compared to baseline. Conversely, no significant change was observed in the DMI group (95% CI, −2.1% to 2.2%; P = 0.24; Fig. 3H).

The meal timing intervention did not significantly modify the effect of simulated night work on cortisol levels (cosinor mixed-model analyses; meal timing group vs. pre/post simulated night work interaction: P = 0.31; Fig. S1). Neither in the NMC group (95% CI, −5.4% to 0.9%) nor in the DMI group (95% CI, −2.1% to 5.6%) was there a significant change in cortisol levels (Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test adjusted for multiple comparisons, P = 0.29 and P = 0.33, respectively). Similarly, the meal timing intervention did not significantly modify the effect of simulated night work on the heart rate (cosinor mixed-model analyses; meal timing group vs. pre/post simulated night work interaction: P = 0.36; Fig. S2). Neither in the NMC group (95% CI, −0.4% to 2.8%) nor in the DMI group (95% CI, −1.2% to 2.1%) was there a significant change in heart rate (Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test adjusted for multiple comparisons, P = 0.39 and P = 0.32, respectively).

The meal timing intervention significantly modified the impact of simulated night work on the SBP and DBP levels (cosinor mixed-model analyses; meal timing group vs. pre/post simulated night work interaction: respectively, P = 0.03 and P = 0.02, respectively; Fig. S3). In the NMC group, SBP and DBP levels did not significantly change after exposure to the simulated night work, compared to baseline (SBP: 95% CI, −1.3% to 2.8%; DBP: 95% CI, −1.1% to 0.7%; Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test adjusted for multiple comparisons, P = 0.22). Conversely, in the DMI group, blood pressure levels significantly decreased by 6-8% after exposure to the simulated night work, compared to baseline (SBP: −6.1%, 95% CI, −8.9% to −4.5%; DBP: −8.0%, 95% CI, −9.1% to −6.9%; Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test adjusted for multiple comparisons, P = 0.005 and P = 0.001). Of note, the meal timing intervention did not significantly modify the impact of simulated night work on the endogenous circadian rhythms (i.e., circadian phase and amplitude) of cortisol, heart rate, SBP, and DBP (cosinor mixed-model analyses; interaction of meal timing group, pre/post simulated night work, and circadian effect: P = 0.45, P = 0.51, P = 0.31 and P = 0.34, respectively).

We found evidence for an increase in cardiovascular risk factors after simulated night work with nighttime and daytime eating, whereas a Daytime Meal Intervention minimized the adverse effects of simulated night shift work on cardiovascular risk factors.

Exposure to simulated night work with nightime and daytime eating decreased cardiac vagal modulation, with vagal (parasympathetic) activity typically considered cardioprotective16, and these findings are consistent with a previous clinical trial that induced circadian misalignment, i.e., 12-h inverted behavioral and environmental cycles for 3 days16. Circadian clocks within the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus (SCN) and the heart set daily rhythms in sinoatrial and atrioventricular node activity, with a consequential time-of-day dependent vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmia21. Exposure to circadian misalignment might alter the electrophysiological cardiac milieu, potentially increasing the susceptibility to adverse cardiac events. This may provide a mechanism underlying the elevated risk of cardiovascular disease and cardiac events in shift workers22,23 Additionally, circadian misalignment decreased PAI-1 concentration by 11% during misalignment in a previous simulated shift work study16, while we show an increase by 24% after misalignment24. Mice exposed to chronic circadian phase shifts had an increase in PAI-1 mRNA expression and PAI-1 levels and decreased tissue-type plasminogen activator mRNA expression in the liver25. Such findings and ours suggest that circadian disruption might induce hypofibrinolysis and increase cardiovascular risk by inducing PAI-1 gene expression following circadian misalignment.

Our results indicate no significant circadian misalignment nor meal timing effects on cortisol levels (Fig. S1), in line with previous results where acute11,12, and chronic26 circadian misalignment had a limited impact on cortisol levels. Similarly, we observed no significant circadian misalignment nor meal timing effects on heart rate (Fig. S2). While not directly comparable to our current study, time-restricted eating (i.e., 8-hour eating window from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.) did not significantly affect heart rate, compared with a control eating pattern (i.e., a self-selected ≥12-hour window)27. Of note, the daytime meal intervention significantly reduced blood pressure levels by 6-8% after exposure to the simulated night work, compared to baseline, an effect that was not observed in the nighttime meal control (Fig. S3). The beneficial effect of appropriately aligned meal timing has been shown in a randomized control trial with shift workers who underwent 12 weeks of 10-h time-restricted eating compared to a standard of care (i.e., nutritional counseling and Mediterranean diet at usual eating times)28. Accordingly, participants consistently showed decreased diastolic blood pressure, compared to those who received standard of care. Similarly, a 14-week parallel-arm, randomized clinical trial weight-loss program with either early TRE (8-hour eating window from 7a.m.–3p.m.) or control eating (i.e., a self-selected ≥12-hour window) showed decreased diastolic blood pressure27. While our DMI findings bear resemblance to these TRE clinical trials, direct comparisons are challenging, as those studies, e.g., modified the fasting durations as part of the intervention, recruited participants who were overweight, included different sample sizes, and were long-term field studies. Of note, we did not observe endogenous circadian rhythms in blood pressure during baseline CR in either group. Circadian blood pressure rhythms have been described in previous laboratory studies29,30,31,32,33. While those previous studies used a Dynamap blood pressure monitor typically used for in-hospital spot-checks, our study used a Spacelabs blood pressure monitor typically used for 24-h automated blood pressure monitoring at home, which limits a direct comparison.

Preclinical work suggests dramatic effects of circadian rhythm disorganization on cardiovascular integrity34. A point mutation in the circadian regulatory gene, casein kinase-1, results in an intrinsic circadian period of 22 h (instead of approximately 24 h in wildtypes), early-onset cardiomyopathy, extensive fibrosis, and severely impaired contractility34. Intriguingly, under light cycles of 22 h, which match their intrinsic period (i.e., in resonance), their cyclic behavioral patterns and heart structure and function normalized, indicating the importance of synchrony between the internal circadian clock with environmental and behavioral cycles34. Moreover, preclinical work suggests a robust 24-h feeding/fasting cycle can maintain cardiac health in a high-fat fed aging Drosophila model, as compared to ad libitum fed flies that showed drastic deterioration of cardiac function, including increased arrhythmia index and reduced heart contractility18. In mice models, time-restricted feeding with food available only during the active nighttime reduced sympathetic activity during the resting daytime35. Here, we show that daytime meal timing avoids the adverse effects of simulated night work on cardiovascular function in humans. Critically, in our laboratory protocol, the design of the meal timing groups was identical (i.e., caloric and macronutrient intake, physical activity, posture, scheduled sleep schedule, and lighting conditions) except for the timing of meals. Moreover, our findings were unlikely due to group differences in participant sociodemographics and study-related characteristics (Table 1). Short sleep duration is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly from cardiovascular disorders, such as CHD, arrhythmias, and hypertension36. As sleep structure before the baseline and simulated night work conditions did not differ between the meal timing groups24, differences in prior sleep are unlikely to mediate our reported effects.

Eating patterns are increasingly varied. Typical breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals during the daytime are no longer the social norm because skipping meals and snacking are becoming increasingly prevalent, as well as eating during the night37. Nighttime eating was associated with increased CHD risk compared with those who did not eat during the night after adjustment for sociodemographic data, diet, lifestyle, and CHD risk factors38. Data from 103,389 adults in the NutriNet-Santé study indicated that a later first meal (after 9 a.m. relative to before 8 a.m.) and a later last meal (after 9 p.m. relative to before 8 p.m.) was associated with elevated CVD risk39. Night shift workers show changes in meal patterns, skipping meals and consuming them during the night40. Therefore, meal timing is a potential modifiable lifestyle factor involved in the higher CVD risk in night workers. In this context, our study demonstrates that a meal-timing-based behavioral intervention can help mitigate the adverse cardiovascular effects induced by a mistimed sleep/wake schedule, as typically experienced by night workers. Limitations in our study include the restricted age range of participants (18–30 years), which limits its relevance to middle-aged and older populations. Moreover, caution is warranted as our study has a limited sample size (due to the stringent participant selection criteria and the intensive and controlled study design) and includes individuals who do not engage in actual shift work. Additionally, we performed an FD protocol to induce circadian misalignment, and while laboratory approaches offer the greatest experimental control, its findings have limited direct translation to night shift workers, as they do not live under such carefully controlled behavioral and environmental conditions. Future clinical trials with larger samples, including individuals undergoing real-life shift work schedules (e.g., permanent, rotating or irregular night shifts, morning shifts, and evening shifts), are needed to establish whether our reported beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors translate to the shift work population.

The protocol was approved by the Partners HealthCare's institutional review board (IRB) and performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and participants provided written informed consent. IRB guidelines were followed. Laboratory protocols were conducted at the Center for Clinical Investigation at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, United States, between 19 March 2015 and 29 August 2018. The study ended when the laboratory protocol for the final randomized participant was completed. Due to the complex study design, this is a single study performed in a human clinical trial. This randomized clinical trial provides proof-of-evidence for the beneficial effect of meal timing as a countermeasure against the adverse cardiovascular effects of circadian misalignment in humans, and future studies are needed to replicate our findings.

Participants admitted to the laboratory protocols were free from medical conditions, including current and previous history of cardiometabolic disorders. Participants were not engaged in shift work, had not crossed more than one time zone in the previous 3 months, and did not have sleep disorders, including insomnia. Medical suitability was assessed using clinical history, biochemical and toxicology blood and urine screenings, and physical and psychological exams. Biochemical blood panels at screening included a comprehensive metabolic panel, TSH, complete blood count, and HbA1c, all of which had to be within typical ranges for study inclusion. Participants were not taking medications (excepting oral contraceptives), caffeine, smoking, or using recreational drugs (verified with urine toxicological panel). Participants underwent a randomized, parallel, controlled, single-blinded trial24, in which they were randomly assigned to one of two meal timing groups. The Nighttime Meal Control Group (NMC) completed a protocol that included simulated day work with day eating [baseline] followed by simulated night work with daytime and nighttime eating, typical for shift workers. The Daytime Meal Intervention Group (DMI) completed a protocol that included simulated day work with day eating (baseline) followed by simulated night work with daytime eating. Participants were randomized using minimization (Minim.exe, MS-DOS free access program for minimizing participants into the arms of a clinical trial) to minimize imbalance between meal timing groups. Minimization was performed—in decreasing sequence of importance—by sex, body mass index (BMI), and age (these factors were dichotomized, i.e., female or male, 18.5–24.9 kg/m2 or 25–29.9 kg/m2, and 18-26 years or 27-35 years, respectively).

Twenty healthy normotensive participants (mean age, 26.6 y [SD, 4.2 y, range: 18–35 y], eight females, BMI range: 18.5–29.9 kg/m2, hemoglobin A1C range: 4.9–5.4%) were randomized to the laboratory protocol: ten were allocated to the NMC Group and ten to the DMI Group (Fig. 1). Four females commenced the laboratory protocol on menstrual cycle days 1-5 (two per meal timing group) and four during days 14–19 (two per meal timing group). We excluded data from one participant in the DMI Group due to their inability to consume all food during the simulated night work. The final study sample included ten participants for the NMC Group (mean age, 27.0 years [SD, 4.4 y], 4 females, BMI: 22.5 kg/m2 [SD, 3.5]), and nine for the DMI Group (mean age, 26.2 years [SD, 4.1 y], 3 females, BMI: 23.1 kg/m2 [SD, 3.1]). Additional study-related characteristics between groups (e.g., diet, chronotype, among others) are shown in Table 1. No statistical differences in participant sociodemographics and study-related characteristics occurred between groups. Other aspects of this study, that was designed to test separate, independent hypotheses, have previously been published24,41,42,43.

To ensure the initial stability of circadian rhythms and sleep patterns, participants were requested to maintain a regular sleep/wake schedule for two weeks prior to admission to the laboratory. The personalized laboratory sleep/wake schedule was determined as the participants' habitual bedtime with 8-h time in bed. To ensure compliance with this schedule, each participant was monitored with at-home wristworn wearables (Actiwatch, Respironics). Participants also called into a time-stamped voice-mailbox when they were going to bed and getting out of bed. If more than one deviation (>1 h) per week from the target sleep/wake time was detected, participants were excluded from the study. In addition, during the three days before the laboratory study, participants received all meals (three meals and one snack) from the Metabolic Kitchen to meet dietary requirements (Harris-Benedict formula with activity factor 1.4) and controlled macronutrient distribution (45–50% carbohydrate, 15–20% protein, 30–35% fat, with 150 mEq Na+ (±20%), 100 mEq K+ (±20%)), to match the subsequent laboratory diet. Participants had to consume the provided meals at their habitual eating times to standardize the amount, type, and timing of food intake before the laboratory protocol. The latter was ensured by participants calling into a time-stamped voice-mailbox when they began each meal and by a daily food log that included food content and times. Participants were requested to consume their meals at the same time as in the laboratory relative to waketime (+/−1h). Participants who did not comply with the dietary requirements were excluded from the laboratory study. Moreover, participants were required to refrain from exercise (running/jogging, swimming, cycling, weight lifting, circuit training, and yoga) for 3 days prior to the laboratory protocol.

Participants remained in individual laboratory suites in an environment free of time cues. Throughout the study, when participants were not involved in a study task, they could undertake leisure activities, such as reading, writing, watching movies, crafts, etc. We monitored each participant's activity for compliance by means of closed-circuit TV and wrist-worn actigraphy. Days 1–2 comprised the laboratory adaptation days. Days 3-4 included a baseline Constant Routine (CR) protocol (Fig. 2), during which participants spent 32 h continuously awake in a constant semi-recumbent body posture, without physical exertion, in dim light (~3 lx in the horizontal angle of gaze) and eating hourly isocaloric snacks. This allowed a baseline assessment of endogenous circadian rhythms of physiologic markers by eliminating or minimizing the influences of behavioral and environmental factors on a given rhythm19. Following the baseline CR, participants had a 12-h sleep opportunity to recover. On Days 5 and 6, participants had further recovery from the baseline CR. On Day 7, participants underwent a 28-h Forced Desynchrony protocol (FD) to induce circadian misalignment, with 28-h sleep/wake cycles under dim light (~3 lx), to which the central circadian pacemaker in humans cannot entrain44. We used a 28-h FD protocol to assess the impact of circadian misalignment on cardiometabolic function11. During each 28-h cycle, the ratio of scheduled wakefulness (18 h:40 min) and sleep (9 h:20 min) was maintained at 2:1, to match the self-selected 8-h habitual time in bed per 24-h. The participants' sleep episodes (0 lx) were split into three identical blocks, each separated by 1 h of wakefulness in dim light (~3 lx) while remaining at rest in a semi-recumbent posture in bed. This allowed the participants to consume food during the circadian day when otherwise they would be sleeping. Importantly, participants woke during each sleep episode irrespective of meal consumption to ensure that both study groups had three equal sleep blocks during each of the FD'days'. On the first 28-h sleep/wake cycle, participants had normal circadian alignment (waking up at their habitual wake-time, e.g., 7a.m.; baseline). In contrast, on the fourth sleep/wake cycle, participants were 12-h misaligned (wake up at, e.g., 7p.m.; simulated night work) as compared to the first cycle in both meal timing groups. The NMC Group had a typical 28-h FD protocol with all behaviors, including the fasting-eating cycle, maintained on a 28-h cycle. Because of that, three meals and a snack were scheduled at fixed times relative to scheduled wake-time (at 0 h:10 min, 4 h:10 min, 8 h:10 min, and 12 h:10 min since scheduled awakening, during baseline and simulated night work). Thus, each meal was shifted 4 h later each cycle, in alignment with the sleep/wake cycle. Participants in the NMC Group thus consumed food during both the daytime and nighttime, which is typical behavior of shift workers. In contrast, the DMI Group had a modified 28-h FD protocol, with all behaviors identically scheduled on a 28-h cycle, except for the fasting/eating cycle that was maintained on a 24-h cycle. Accordingly, participants had standardized meals at 0 h:10 min, 4 h:10 min, 8 h:10 min, and 12 h:10 min relative to the habitual wake time of the participant, regardless of the sleep/wake cycle. This meal timing approach in the DMI Group allowed alignment of the fasting/eating cycle to the ~24-h central circadian cycle and ensured meal consumption only during the daytime and at the same clock time during each FD cycle. After the four “days” of a 28-h FD protocol, participants underwent a post-misalignment CR (Days 11/12/13) that allowed assessing the impact of prior circadian misalignment on endogenous circadian rhythms. During the post-misalignment CR, participants spent 40-h under the same experimental conditions described for the baseline CR. Thereafter, participants were scheduled to a 12-h sleep opportunity to allow them to recover partially from the post-misalignment CR protocol, and then were discharged from the study.

Participants received an isocaloric diet (i.e., CR snacks) calculated according to the Harris-Benedict equation with an activity factor of 1.2 (as participants had decreased activity). The diet consisted of 45–50% carbohydrate, 15–20% protein, 30–35% fat, with 150 mEq Na+ (±20%), 100 mEq K+ (±20%), and at least 2.5 L of water per 24 h. CR snacks comprised two alternating CR options (e.g., CR snack A, then CR snack B, then CR snack A, and so forth). This was based on a food preference form for each participantʼs two CR preselected CR snack choices (2 of 6 snack choices with different ingredients but the same macronutrient composition). CR snacks were calculated with the same two snack options and the same caloric level throughout both CR protocols per participant. Participants had 10–15 minutes to consume the CR snacks and were instructed to consume all food provided (verified by checking their food trays). During the CR protocol, actual energy consumption in the NMC Group was 99.9% (SEM, 0.01) and 99.9% (SEM, 0.04%) during baseline CR and post-misalignment CR, respectively. In the DMI Group, it was 98.6% (SEM, 1.9%) and 99.9% (SEM, 0.01%) during baseline CR and post-misalignment CR, respectively.

During the FD protocol, participants received meals (breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner) standardized across days based on a food preference form for each participant. Meals were calculated according to a 28-h day for the NMC Group and to a 24-h day for the DMI Group, during the four “days” in the FD protocol. Diet was calculated according to the Harris-Benedict equation with an activity factor of 1.4, and consisted of 45–50% carbohydrate, 15–20% protein, 30–35% fat, with 150 mEq Na+ (±20%), 100 mEq K+ (±20%), and at least 2.5 L of water per 24 h. The energy content of the meals/snack (% of total “day's” calorie intake) was as follows: Breakfast: 33.3% (±35 kcals); Lunch: 23.4% (±20 kcals); Snack: 10% ( ± 10 kcals); Dinner: 33.3% (±35 kcals). Breakfast and Dinner Test meals (used for glucose tolerance assessment published separately24) were preselected (one of two test meal choices, based on a food preference form for each participant).

During the other segments of the laboratory protocol, participants received an isocaloric diet, calculated according to the Harris–Benedict equation with an activity factor of 1.4. The diet had the same macronutrient composition as for the CR and FD segments, which was 45–50% carbohydrate, 15–20% protein, 30–35% fat, with 150 mEq Na+ (±20%), 100 mEq K+ (±20%), and at least 2.5 L of water per 24 h. Participants were instructed to consume all food provided (verified by checking their food trays).

The primary and secondary outcomes of this study are reported in clinicaltrials.gov (clinical trial registration: NCT02291952). Accordingly, the primary outcomes of this study as reported in ref. 24 were changes in glucose tolerance, plasma insulin levels, and plasma leptin levels. These primary outcomes were published in24, except for the leptin results, due to funding constraints and issues regarding preprocessing of the blood assays. The secondary outcomes of this study were: changes in circadian phase markers, such as from core body temperature and cortisol, in the circadian rhythm in resting energy expenditure, in hunger and appetite, mood, and cognitive performance, in microbiota, gene expression, epigenetic or proteomic markers, and in sleep. Most of these secondary outcomes have been published16,41,42,43.

The study is a secondary analysis of our randomized clinical trial, and here we assessed the following cardiovascular measurements:

Heart rate variability (pNN50, RMSSD, and LF/HF ratio). Electrocardiographic (ECG) measurements were performed continuously during the CR protocols, and data were binned into every 10-min.

PAI-1 concentration. Assays were obtained using blood samples every 2 hours during the baseline and post-misalignment CR protocols.

1) Blood pressure and heart rate. Measurements were obtained with a Spacelabs 90217 ambulatory blood pressure monitor (Spacelabs Medical, Inc.) placed on the non-dominate arm. 2) Cortisol concentration. Assays were obtained using blood samples every hour during the baseline and post-misalignment CR protocols.

Electrocardiographic (ECG) measurements were performed continuously during the CR protocols, and data were binned into 10-min bins. R-wave peak detection was done using ARISTOTLE45 following the same procedures as outlined in previously published work46,47. We established an analysis pipeline using MATLAB (Ver. R2022a; The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) for HRV analyses. Specifically, consecutive R peaks were used to construct the RR interval time series. As the R peak detection was based on an automated approach, anomalous intervals due to false detections could not be avoided. They are usually manifested as spikes in the time series. To diminish the influence of these spikes on subsequent analyses, an impulse rejection filter was first applied, and if spikes were ever identified, they were replaced by the median value of the surrounding five samples48. Time- and frequency-domain analyses of RR interval time series were done per 10-min fixed time window. Time-domain measures included the root mean square of the successive differences in RR intervals (RMSSD) and the proportion of the number of times that successive normal sinus intervals differed greater than 50 ms (pNN50). Greater values of RMSSD or pNN50 mean higher vagal modulation. No results were rendered if the 10-min time series contained less than 20 RR intervals. For frequency-domain analysis, each 10-min time series was first evenly resampled. The power spectral density (psd) was computed using the Welch's method with an added Hanning window. The power of low-frequency (LF; 0.04–0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF; 0.15–0.4 Hz) bands were then calculated. Note that for a reliable estimation of the psd, at least two consecutive segments, each with 150-s data, were required. The PSD was performed separately to each 150-s data, and the final psd for the 10-min time series was estimated by averaging all available psd's. If less than two consecutive 150-s data were available, no frequency-domain results were rendered.

Blood pressure and heart rate measurements started shortly after constant routine protocol started until scheduled recovery sleep time. Measurements were obtained with a Spacelabs 90217 ambulatory blood pressure monitor (Spacelabs Medical, Inc.) placed on the non-dominate arm. Such method has been validated according to the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation's standards49. Due to data loss, we had full time-series data for seven participants in the NMC group and six participants in the DMI group for the blood pressure and heart rate measurements.

PAI-1 and cortisol assays were obtained using blood samples every 2-hours and one hour, respectively, during the baseline and post-misalignment CR protocols. On admission to the laboratory, an 18-gauge intravenous catheter was inserted into the participant's forearm. The catheter was connected to a triple-stopcock manifold (Cobe Laboratories Inc., Lakewood, CO) via an intravenous loop with a 12-foot small-lumen extension cable (Sorex Pharmaceuticals, Salt Lake City, UT) through which blood sampling could continue in the next room without disturbing sleep. Between samples, infusion of a solution of 0.45% saline with 5000 IU/liter heparin at one drop every 5 to 10 sec maintained patency. Blood was transferred to 5-cm3 vacutainer tubes and centrifuged at 4 °C, pipetted into polystyrene tubes, and frozen at −80 °C until analysis. Participants' hematocrit and hemoglobin were measured on each CR day and on FD day 1 and day 4 (when blood measurements took place) to assess whether levels remained within normal range.

We performed statistical analyses using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The sample size derived from the difference in the effect of misalignment on glucose tolerance (primary endpoint: 3 h postprandial plasma glucose profiles; for details, see24) between the meal timing groups. To determine a large effect size (d = 1.5) with −80% power, eight participants per group were required (total sample = 16). We compared participants' characteristics with Yates's chi-squared tests or two-tailed t-tests for independent groups, and their demographics and study-related characteristics did not significantly differ between the meal timing groups (Table 1).

Females and males were included in the study with a 1:1 ratio. Biological sex was self-reported. This study was not designed to test for sex-differences and the sample size calculation did not include sex as a potential factor of interest, as there are no sex differences reported for meal timing studies in humans. Thus, we did not test for interaction effects of sex or menstrual phase because of the limited sample size. Regarding race, we included 1 Black, 1 Asian American, and 8 White participants in the control group, and 1 Black and 8 White participants in the intervention group. Regarding ethnicity, we included 10 non-Hispanics in the control group, and 7 non-Hispanics and 2 Hispanics in the intervention group. The race and ethnicity ratio are in accordance with the population demographics census of 2014 for the state of Massachusetts, United States. Race and ethnicity were self-reported. This study was not designed to test for race and ethnicity differences and the sample size calculation did not factor these as a potential covariate of interest, as there are no race and ethnicity differences reported for meal timing studies in humans. Thus, we did not test for such differences in the effects of the intervention because of the limited sample size.

We assessed cardiac vagal modulation by heart rate variability analyses, blood pressure, and blood assays of cortisol and PAI-1 before and after the simulated night work (i.e., pre/post night work, i.e., baseline CR and post-misalignment CR, respectively). This CR approach allowed disentangling the contribution of endogenous circadian control from the acute effects of fasting/eating, sleep/wake, rest/activity, and dark/light cycles19. We first performed tests of normality (the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and the Shapiro–Wilk test). As the outcomes had non-normal data distribution, we normalized the cardiovascular data using an average of each participant's levels measured throughout the Baseline CR. This approach also allowed minimizing interindividual differences in physiologic measures. We applied a mean ± 3 SD (standard deviation) filter to remove outliers on the raw data. Data from the first 5 h after starting the CRs were excluded from analysis, as is standard, to allow for stabilization of circadian rhythms. The effects of the circadian cycle and circadian alignment condition were assessed by cosinor analyses using mixed model analyses of variance (PROC MIXED, SAS), which were applied to all cardiovascular outcomes. These cosinor mixed-models included “Circadian effect” (a fundamental circadian component of ∼24-h), “Time since scheduled waketime” (a linear effect of hours into the CR protocol), “pre/post simulated night work” (baseline CR vs. post-misalignment CR), “meal timing group” (NMC and DMI), and the interaction of meal timing group and pre/post night work. Additionally, we tested whether the meal timing intervention modified the impact of simulated night work on the endogenous circadian cardiovascular rhythms (i.e., circadian phase and amplitude) using cosinor mixed-model analyses that included the interaction of meal timing group, pre/post night work, and circadian effect. In the results section, we also report the percentage of change from baseline to post-simulated night work, per group. This corresponds to the post-hoc results from the interaction of meal timing group and pre/post night work, and are presented for each group separately, as we used a parallel design (i.e., while each participant serves as their baseline per meal timing condition, different participants were enrolled for the two meal timing groups).

Missing data were not included in the cosinor mixed-model analyses (pNN50: 0.81%; RMSSD: 0.81%; LF/HF: 0.82%, and PAI-1: 1.12%). Participant was included as a random factor. Post-hoc comparisons used the Tukey-Kramer test to adjust for multiple testing. To control overall type I error in null hypothesis testing when conducting multiple comparisons, P-values from the mixed-model analysis were adjusted using False Discovery Rates (pFDR) (PROC MULTTEST, SAS) for the primary (i.e., pNN50, RMSSD, LF/HF ratio) and secondary (PAI-1) cardiovascular outcomes. Unless specified, data are the mean and standard error of the mean. The significance for all statistical tests was set as P < 0.05.

Five scientists who contributed to the development of the blockbuster weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy have picked up one of this year's Breakthrough prizes — the most lucrative awards in science. The prize is shared between the four researchers who discovered and characterized GLP-1, and Lotte Bjerre Knudsen of the pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, who spearheaded the development of drugs based on these discoveries. One of the fundamental-physics prizes was awarded to 13,508 physicists for work done at CERN, Europe's particle physics laboratory. The prize money will be used to fund international students to visit the collider. Other Breakthrough prizes were given to scientists for their research into multiple sclerosis, for creating the gene-editing technologies known as base editing and prime editing, and for proving a mathematical concept called the geometric Langlands conjecture.

The critically endangered sunflower star has found a refuge to protect itself from a mysterious disease in Canadian coastal fjords. Pycnopodia helianthoides reaches one metre in diameter and has as many as 24 arms. But it disintegrates in a few days when exposed to sea star wasting disease, whose cause is unknown. Since 2013, the disease has killed 90% of sunflower stars worldwide. Researchers found that, in the deep, cold fjords of British Columbia, populations remained stable, showing signs of disease but without high mortality.

A wave of shock and fear has spread among university researchers as US immigration officials have moved to detain and deport international students and scholars. Some arrests are notionally linked to participation in protests in support of Palestinians in Gaza, others aren't: for example, a bioinformatician was arrested at the US border after failing to declare frog embryos. Multiple organizations representing university faculty members filed a lawsuit on 25 March challenging the actions. “People are living in fear, if not for their lives, then certainly for their liberty and safety,” says mathematician Michael Thaddeus.

The team led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr pressured the country's top vaccine regulator to deliver non-existent anti-vaccine data and weaken regulation of unproved stem-cell treatments, and forced him to resign when he refused, reports The Wall Street Journal. In his resignation letter, hematologist-oncologist Peter Marks said that “it has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies”. Kennedy had a history of spreading vaccine and health-related misinformation before being named by President Donald Trump as head of the US Department of Health and Human Services. He downplayed his past statements, but has since made moves that worry public-health specialists, such as reportedly tipping an anti-vaccine activist to pursue evidence in support of a discredited claim that vaccines are linked to autism.

The growing role of artificial intelligence (AI) in science could do more harm than good if modelling-based approaches are wielded without nuance or understanding, argue computer scientists Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor. “Errors are becoming increasingly common, especially when off-the-shelf tools are used by researchers who have limited expertise in computer science,” they write. And, even if it's error-free, “it is easy for researchers to overestimate the predictive capabilities of an AI model, thereby creating the illusion of progress while stalling real advancements”.

Before he was a hitting co-ordinator for the New York Yankees, Aaron Leanhardt was a physicist. When the team wanted to find a way for some of its players to boost their hitting power, he put his skills to work: the result is the ‘torpedo' bat, which moves the centre of mass closer to the hands. Whether the bat has really given hitters an advantage, or it's just the placebo effect, the result has been a “home-run barrage”, writes sports reporter Louisa Thomas.

Science has a trust problem — at least, that is the common perception. If only, the argument goes, we could get people to ‘trust' or ‘follow' the science, we, as a society, would be doing more about climate change, childhood vaccination rates would be increasing rather than decreasing and fewer people would have died during the COVID-19 pandemic. Characterizing the problem as ‘science denialism', however, is misleading and wrongly suggests that the solution is to build greater trust between scientists and the public.

Indeed, the research produced by our organizations — the Edelman Trust Institute think tank and the Global Listening Project non-profit organization — suggests that trust in science and scientists remains high globally. But scientists and scientific information exist in an increasingly complex ecosystem in which people's perception of what counts as reliable evidence or proof is influenced by myriad other people and factors, including politics, religion, culture and personal belief. In the face of this complexity, the public are turning to friends, family, journalists and others to help them filter and interpret the vast amounts of information available.

Our work suggests that the crux of science's current challenge is not lost trust, but rather misplaced trust in untrustworthy sources. High trust levels can be dangerous when they are invested in institutions and individuals that are misinformed or not well-intentioned. In this regard, it is especially problematic when societal institutions become politicized and advocate policies and behaviours that are at odds with scientific consensus.

Misplaced trust can drive behaviours that put people's lives at risk1,2. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, cases and deaths were higher in nations, such as the United States and Brazil, that had political leaders who dismissed the severity or even existence of the pandemic, undermined the need for masks and questioned the safety of the vaccines2–4.

In what follows, we share data on trust in science and strategies to help scientists compete with non-credentialed sources for influence.

Trust in science is generally high. A survey, conducted in 68 countries between November 2022 and August 2023, found that 75% of respondents said that they trusted scientists5. In a separate study across 70 countries, conducted by the Global Listening Project between July and September 2023, 71% of respondents said that they had high trust in science (see go.nature.com/3qyawpb). And the 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer, an annual online survey of 28 countries conducted by the Edelman Trust Institute in November 2023, found that 74% of respondents trust scientists to tell the truth about new innovations and technologies6.

By contrast, our research revealed concern over the sanctity and independence of science, especially for certain topics, such as COVID-19 and climate change. More than half of Trust Barometer respondents (53%) said that science had become politicized in their country, and 59% said that governments and other large funding organizations have too much influence on how science is done6. One by-product of these perceptions has been an increase in aggression towards scientists7.

Another damaging consequence of this politicization is that it makes people more open to alternative narratives that might not be evidence-based and are often rooted in political ideologies, on topics such as climate and vaccines. This ideological schism is not defined by a pro-science versus anti-science antipathy but by a ‘my science' versus ‘your science' or a ‘my evidence' versus ‘your evidence' polarization.

Often, this tension stems from the fact that scientists seek truth in experiments and data analyses, and focus on effects that manifest across large numbers of people. By contrast, the public is often focused on, and driven by, the experiences of people they know personally or vicariously. These experiences are taken as evidence and often carry more weight than peer-reviewed research.

All sides claim respect for science and evidence, hence the generally high numbers for trust in scientists across ideological groups; but each side has its own version of the ‘truth' based on its own evidence and its own interpretation of what actions the evidence dictates6.

For example, parental concerns about the potential of vaccines to cause autism have been refuted by many scientific studies8; nevertheless, a parent's experience with their own child or witnessing what has happened to others can be taken as direct and compelling evidence of a causal rather than a coincidental link between the timing of a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and the onset of autism. Sometimes a sample of one, when you know that person, is more powerful emotionally, if not statistically, than a sample of 10,000.

Competing narratives around topics such as vaccines or climate change can also breed confusion, which manifests as doubt or misguided beliefs about the best actions to take, for oneself and for wider society. Doubt can weaken people's resolve to support and follow scientific advice, especially when doing so requires effort, risk and sacrifice. Misguided beliefs, meanwhile, can lead people to act against their own or society's best interests.

Another challenge is that many people trust non-scientists to tell them the truth about scientific matters. According to the 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer report, those with most influence include ‘someone like me' (74%) and ‘friends and family' (78%). Even celebrities (39%) and religious leaders (43%) enjoy substantial amounts of trust on technology and innovation matters6. Participants in the Global Listening Project study ranked family members higher than scientists when it came to who they would go to for truthful information in a crisis (see go.nature.com/3qyawpb and ‘Local influences').

Although these other sources generally lack scientific credentials, they exhibit other characteristics that people associate with legitimacy. In particular, respondents to the 2025 Edelman Trust Barometer survey conducted between October and November last year indicated that relevant personal experience (70%) is more strongly associated with source legitimacy than are formal training and academic credentials (65%; see go.nature.com/4jpparb). Although this might not affect the world of theoretical physics, it does matter in domains such as health and climate.

Legitimacy based on personal experience is something that people extend to themselves. The 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer Special Report: Trust and Health survey9, which involved 16 countries and was conducted in March last year, found that 65% of people are confident in their own judgement, information acumen and personal efficacy when it comes to health matters (see ‘Trust in health'). Of these ‘high health self-confidence' individuals, 43% have relatively low trust in the health-care system9. High health self-confidence coupled with trust in health-care systems generally drives better health outcomes, but when there is a high level of self-confidence accompanied by low levels of trust, things can be problematic.

Source: Ref. 9

This is especially true when it comes to complying with public-health mandates, acceptance of medical-care innovations and being a positive influence on the health decisions of others. In the case of vaccines, those who reported themselves as being self-confident with high trust in the health-care system were more likely to be fully vaccinated (including all boosters) against COVID-19 (54%) than were those who felt equally self-confident but had lower trust (40%)9.

The threat posed by high levels of trust in non-credentialed sources is exacerbated by where and how people get their scientific information. Most often, it is through online searches, which return a mix of credentialed and non-credentialed information. Because of how people judge credibility, it cannot be assumed that they will discount non-credentialed information in favour of evidence-based, peer-reviewed findings. In fact, those with high self-confidence and little trust in official sources are often drawn to non-credentialed voices and sources8.

Because the information ecosystem contains misinformation disseminated by sources who lack scientific training but are trusted at similar levels to those who have had training, scientists need to communicate better — with more relevance, emotional resonance and empathy — if they are going to compete with other sources that are increasingly influential.

We recommend three strategies for scientists to enhance the influence of evidence-based, peer-reviewed information.

First, work with locally trusted sources to disseminate information. Beyond their credibility, respected individuals such as physicians and religious leaders are often in the best position to make information relevant to people's lives and their values. Public-health authorities that issue scientific information, as well as academic and research institutions, should identify and work with such partners, and provide them with training to become trusted sources of information armed with accurate and compelling arguments to address misconceptions.

For example, people trust family physicians more than they do scientists in some settings, and religious leaders are more influential than scientists in many countries. Employers are another potential partner: 68% of respondents said they trust their employer to do what is right when it comes to addressing their health-related needs and concerns9. This trust was higher than for government, media, business and non-governmental organizations.

Vaccines have made several deadly diseases a thing of the past.Credit: Christina House/Los Angeles Times/Getty

A second unvaccinated child in Texas has died from measles, amplifying fears that the outbreak there could be wider than reported. 

 The death, announced on 6 April, also harkens back to a pre-vaccine past that many Americans have forgotten, when hundreds of children died each year of measles.

Generations ago, a child swimming in a community pool could become paralysed by polio. Pregnant individuals who contracted rubella (also called German measles) were at risk of their babies being born deaf, intellectually disabled or stillborn.

Vaccines have granted families in wealthy countries the luxury of forgetting this history, says Anne Schuchat, a former deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. “Many doctors have never seen these diseases because our vaccines have been so successful,” she says.

But public-health specialists fear that vaccination is under threat. Around the world, funds for vaccination drives are in jeopardy as the United States scales back foreign aid, and other countries and public-health organizations juggle competing demands.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr, a prominent anti-vaccine campaigner, has risen to head the US Department of Health and Human Services, which has the power to shape the country's approach to public health. Misinformation about vaccine safety and efficacy is rampant in the United States and beyond. “It can be very confusing for parents right now with the flood of information they get,” says Schuchat.

To illustrate the impact of vaccines, Nature examines the millions of lives that they have saved.

An alarming outbreak of measles is raging in the United States. It has infected more than 500 people and hospitalized dozens. In addition to the two Texas children, measles is thought to have killed an adult in New Mexico — the first measles deaths in the country in the past decade.

Before the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963, the country saw hundreds of thousands of measles infections each year. Within a decade of the vaccine's roll-out, infections in the United States plummeted from about 450,000 a year to fewer than 50,000 (see ‘Measles cases in the United States'). Measles kills up to 3 out of every 1,000 infected people.

In 2000, the World Health Organization declared that measles had been eliminated from the United States. But measles is so contagious that at least 95% of a population must be immunized to prevent transmission. US vaccination has dropped to 93% among children starting school, with pockets of the country falling even lower.

If the measles virus circulates in the country for more than a year, the virus will no longer be considered eliminated. “We can't take for granted the progress that we've made,” says Schuchat.

About 55 countries were reporting large measles outbreaks at the end last year, and an outbreak in Vietnam is thought to have infected tens of thousands of people.

The world is teetering on the edge of eradicating polio, thanks to a global vaccination campaign that has eliminated the virus in every country except Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The only virus to ever have been eradicated globally is smallpox in 1980. Eradicating polio would be an enormous victory against a virus that once killed or paralysed more than half a million people every year in the middle of the twentieth century, before vaccines were introduced (see ‘Severe polio').

Polio is not nearly as contagious as the measles, but it is still important to maintain high vaccination rates, says Neil Maniar, a public-health researcher at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. “If we start to see a consistent decline around the world in polio vaccination rates, all it takes is a couple of outbreaks for infections to start to expand more rapidly,” he says.

In total, childhood vaccinations have saved about 154 million lives over the past 50 years. Most of these are thanks to the measles vaccine, which has saved more lives than vaccines against tetanus, whooping cough (pertussis) and tuberculosis combined (see ‘Childhood vaccines save lives').

Source: Shattock/The Lancet

That figure doesn't include lives saved by the eradication of smallpox. Obidimma Ezezika, who studies vaccine implementation at the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada, estimates that the world would lose at least five million people each year to smallpox, had vaccines not been used to stamp out the virus entirely. 

Even without the development of new vaccines, just getting existing ones to more people would save another one to two million lives each year, Ezezika estimates.

“As I think about the great public-health success stories of the past century, vaccinations are at the top of that list,” says Maniar.

Metrics details

The prevalence of crop insect pests, which damage crops and reduce their yield, is increasing globally owing to changes in climate and land use, posing a threat to food security. In this Review, we synthesize evidence on how tropical, temperate, migratory and soil crop pests respond to changes in climate, land use and agricultural practices. In general, crop pests are responding to warming with expanded geographic ranges, advanced phenological events and increased number of reproductive generations per year. Increased pest damage under warming is projected to exacerbate yield losses of 46%, 19% and 31% under 2 °C warming for wheat, rice and maize, respectively. Pests at mid–high latitudes respond more positively to warming than those in the tropics. Moderate drought can increase pest damage to crops owing to enhanced feeding on plants as a water source and decreased resilience of plants and natural enemies of pests. Increased precipitation reduces small pests through washing them away, but favours pests in general through buffering thermal-hydro stresses. Land use change, such as deforestation and conversion to cropland, enhances warming and reduces biodiversity, leading to enhanced crop damage. Agricultural intensification, particularly fertilization and irrigation, increases the quality and quantity of host plants and buffers pests from environmental extremes, favouring proliferation. Globalization of trade networks increases pest invasions, with associated damage exceeding US $423 billion in 2019. Future research should examine the mechanisms underlying changes in pest status and develop monitoring and prediction systems to inform management approaches.

Climate warming and associated increasing extreme heat events are shifting tropical and temperate pest risks towards higher latitudes and elevations. Warming and heatwaves are extending the pest damage season, delaying pest diapause onset in warm temperate regions but disrupting diapause and weakening cold tolerance in cool temperate regions.

Migratory pests adapt well to global change owing to their high stress tolerances and their migratory behaviour allowing them to track suitable host plants and climate. Soil pests thrive worldwide as soil buffers them from exposure to extreme climates, toxic chemicals and natural predators, and pests can locate optimal thermal and moisture conditions through vertical movement within the soil profile.

Agricultural practices, such as irrigation and fertilization, provide pests with optimal host plant conditions, buffer climate stresses and reduce natural biological control through reduced biodiversity, whereas Bt-crop adoption curtails pest population. Land use changes, such as deforestation and cropland expansion, proliferate pests by modifying local climates, creating favourable conditions for pests and disrupting natural enemies, whereas landscape diversification promotes natural pest control.

Key pests impacting crops are aphids for wheat and soybean, planthoppers and stem borers for rice, and corn borers, noctuid caterpillars and locusts for maize. Warming promotes wheat pest abundance in the spring, moves rice pest damage from the subtropics to temperate regions and favours maize and soybean pests.

Yield losses to crop pests and pesticide use are increasing. However, pests could also decline in the future due to climate extremes, genetically modified crops and climate-smart pesticide applications.

Sustainable pest management can be achieved through increasing landscape and biological diversity, developing conservation biological control strategies. Increasing natural enemy biodiversity can help naturally control pest populations and reduce reliance on pesticides.

Meta cheated on an AI benchmark, and that is hilarious. According to Kylie Robison at The Verge the suspicions started percolating after Meta released two new AI models based on its Llama 4 large language model over the weekend. The new models are Scout, a smaller model intended for quick queries, and Maverick, which is meant to be a super efficient rival to more well-known models like OpenAi's GPT-4o (the harbinger of our Miyazaki apocalypse).

In the blog post announcing them, Meta did what every AI company now does with a major release. They dropped a whole bunch of highly technical data to brag about how Meta's AI was smarter and more efficient than models from companies better associated with AI: Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. These release posts are always mired in deeply technical data and benchmarks that are hugely beneficial to researchers and the most AI obsessive, but kind of useless for the rest of us. Meta's announcement was no different.

But plenty of AI obsessives immediately noticed one shocking benchmark result Meta highlighted in its post. Maverick had an ELO score of 1417 in LMArena. LMArena is an open-source collaborative benchmarking tool where users can vote on the best output. A higher score is better and Maverick's 1417 put it in the number 2 spot on LMArena's leaderboard, just above GPT-4o and just below Gemini 2.5 Pro. The whole AI ecosystem rumbled with surprise at the results.

Then they started digging, and quickly noted that in the fine print, Meta had acknowledged the Maverick model crushing on LMArena was a tad different than the version users have access to. The company had programmed this model to be more chatty than usual. Effectively it charmed the benchmark into submission.

It doesn't seem like LMArena was pleased with the charm offensive. “Meta's interpretation of our policy did not match what we expect from model providers,” it said in a statement on X. “Meta should have made it clearer that ‘Llama-4-Maverick-03-26-Experimental' was a customized model to optimize for human preference. As a result of that we are updating our leaderboard policies to reinforce our commitment to fair, reproducible evaluations so this confusion doesn't occur in the future.”

I love LMArena's optimism here because gaming a benchmark feels like a right of passage in consumer technology and I suspect this trend will continue. I've been covering consumer technology for over a decade, I once ran one of the more extensive benchmarking labs in the industry, and I have seen plenty of phone and laptop makers attempt all kinds of tricks to juice their scores. They messed with display brightness for better battery life and shipped bloatware-free versions of laptops to reviewers to get better performance scores.

Now AI models are getting more chatty to juice their scores too. And the reason I suspect this won't be the last carefully cultivated score is that right now these companies are desperate to distinguish their large language models from one another. If every model can help you write a shitty English paper five minutes before class then you'll need another reason to distinguish your preference. “My model uses less energy and accomplishes the task 2.46% faster,” might not seem like the biggest brag to all, but it matters. That's still 2.46% faster than everyone else.

As these AIs continue to mature into actual consumer-facing products we'll start seeing more benchmark bragging. Hopefully, we'll see the other stuff too. User interfaces will start to change, goofy stores like the Explore GPT section of the ChatGPT app will become more common. These companies are going to need to prove why their models are the best models and benchmarks alone won't do that. Not when a chatty bot can game the system so easily.

If there's one word on your mind this week, it's probably tariffs. Last week, President Trump announced sweeping tariffs on foreign goods imported into the US, setting the stage for a global trade war and stoking fears of a recession. A blanket 10 percent tariff on all imports kicked off on Saturday, April 5, with additional reciprocal tariffs on 60 countries to take effect by April 9.

It's a wildly dynamic situation that's changing by the day, but you might wonder how this affects you. The first thing to know is that tariffs are paid by the company importing a product into the country. In short, that fee affects their bottom line, so companies often pass those costs on to consumers by increasing the price of the goods.

Here's an example from Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University: Let's say a laptop costs $400 at import in the US. A retailer would then add an average gross margin rate of 30 percent—how much revenue the retailer retains after deducting the cost to produce or acquire the item—and that laptop will now cost $571. That's the price you'll pay at a big box store.

China exports a lot of laptops to the US, and as of April 9, you'll have to factor in the 54 percent tariff. (Update: The White House now says China tariffs will be 104 percent, according to CNBC.) Based on historical data that suggests 95 percent of the tariff is absorbed by the importer, the import price jumps by $205 to $605, and if the retailer passes those costs to you, the new total you'll pay at the store is $776. That represents 36 percent inflation, and the retailer's gross margin rate is lowered to 22 percent. Basically, you pay more, and the retailer earns less.

Every country has been affected by Trump's tariff salvo. While many product categories will likely see prices rise, electronics is a big one. "There's not any major electronics-producing nation that's not substantially affected by tariffs," Miller says, including Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan, and India. He believes tariffs will be negotiated for many countries, but expects the tariffs on China to stay.

That will heavily impact the prices of goods like smartphones, laptops, and video game consoles. Smartphones are the largest import from China, with laptops sitting in second. Miller says it's important for consumers to understand that while there were tariffs on some goods from China before, there were zero tariffs on electronics like smartphones and laptops as of January 2025.

His advice? If you were planning on upgrading your laptop, tablet, or smartphone soon—maybe the battery is lackluster or it's just too old—do it now. “Buy it now. Do not wait, it makes no sense to do that,” he says. You likely won't see prices rise for a few months as companies have stocked up on goods ahead of the impending trade war, but if nothing changes in the coming weeks, Miller expects to see prices soar starting in June or July.

Miller rattled off various categories outside of electronics that would also be affected, specifically from China, which is the second largest source of imports to the US behind Mexico:

Outside of higher prices, Miller says consumers should expect less product variety. “What importers are going to do is they're only going to import their most profitable, best-selling items for which they know they can still make a profit under these tariff regimes.” Apple will still import its iPhones, but a smaller smartphone maker that doesn't sell many units of a specific model may skip the US market entirely. It will also negatively impact any product where there's already a lot of consumer sensitivity to price increases.

A few companies have already made tariff-related announcements on their products. Nintendo canceled the original April 9 preorder date for the Switch 2 video game console and has yet to provide a new date, though its June 5 launch window hasn't changed.

Jaguar Land Rover Automotive is pausing auto shipments to the US this month. And Framework, known for making repairable laptops, is also pausing sales on a few models of its base Framework Laptop 13. Razer seems to have paused direct sales of its laptops in the US, though the company hasn't responded to our request for comment. Fujifilm announced a new Instax 41 camera today, but says it “has not yet determined the camera's pricing for the US market.”

WIRED reached out to more than 70 companies, from electronics manufacturers to coffee companies, asking if they could share any details about potential price increases on imported products. The vast majority, like Garmin, Oura, Amazon, Logitech, OnePlus, and Steelcase, declined to comment, while others said it was too early to discuss pricing. Still, some companies responded.

Popular home office furniture brand, Branch, says it has been preparing for trade policy changes for some time, finding efficiencies in its supply chain to absorb the impact of tariffs with minimal increases to pricing. The company says there's a lot of uncertainty: “Candidly, we may need to adjust some prices in the coming months, particularly for products sourced from countries where tariff rates came in significantly higher than we anticipated.” Branch says if there is a price change, it will be to protect margins rather than to expand them. It's worth noting that Branch's Ergonomic Chair, long recommended in WIRED's Best Office Chairs guide, used to be $339 but is now $359, though Branch says the price was adjusted before tariffs were announced.

Drip coffee maker Moccamaster says it may absorb “some short-term pressures at the US level," though it's too early to confirm whether prices will increase. Portland-based coffee machine maker Ratio says it's holding prices steady through April, but “tariffs this high will unequivocally compel higher retail prices—potentially much higher. We are a small business that was already struggling with increasing costs.”

Supernote, a company that makes digital notebooks, pointed to a statement it made on Reddit. It's implementing a price increase in the US by the end of April: “We are actively adjusting our supply chain to mitigate the long-term impact of these tariffs," the company says on Reddit. ”These adjustments take time, especially with the new tariffs hitting everything from people to penguins, which makes the situation more complicated. It's going to be a tough time."

The company behind smart bird feeders from brands like Harymor and Sehmua, says it's exploring strategies to absorb costs internally, with no price adjustments—"We are facing rising expenses that directly affect our profit margins. … We recognize the competitive nature of the market and the price sensitivity of our customers."

Meanwhile, Samsung hasn't responded to our request for comment yet, but the company told Reuters the tariffs don't affect its TVs as much since most are produced in Mexico.

We'll keep adding information from brands as we receive it. While it's too early to make a definitive statement on an ever-evolving situation, we can probably expect higher prices on almost everything if the tariff situation remains unchanged. The last thing we want is for everyone to panic buy, but if you need a new phone, a mechanical keyboard, or an air purifier, you should probably start looking now.

Updated on April 8: We've added new information on the latest China tariffs and how Razer seems to be pausing US sales of its laptops.

On Monday, the “de-extinction” startup Colossal Biosciences announced its most ambitious results to date: the dire wolf. These are creatures that have been extinct for more than 12,000 years and made famous by the HBO show “Game of Thrones.”

These white, fluffy animals live on a 2,000-acre preserve in a location so secretive that journalists, including from TechCrunch, who were invited to view the live animals, were not invited to the compound itself, located in the northern United States. Instead we flew to another secretive location to see the animals with our own eyes because in this age of AI, a photo can't be trusted.  

There we saw two six-month-old males named Remus and Romulus, each already weighing about 80 pounds. They looked to an inexperienced eye like very big wild dogs with slightly larger skulls and an elongated muzzle. In addition to Remus and Romulus, the company's engineered dire wolf pack includes a female named Khaleesi, who is two months old.

But the company says that there's very little that's ordinary about them. Colossal's dire wolves are the result of an 18-month effort based on the genes found in the fossils of a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull of the extinct animals.

When Colossal Biosciences announced its latest fundraise at a $10.2 billion valuation earlier this year, the company's co-founder and CEO Ben Lamm told TechCrunch he believed the startup was undervalued given its actual scientific progress.

Given the common startup tendency to overstate capabilities, it wasn't easy to take Lamm's claims at face value, particularly since Colossal's ambitious de-extinction projects for the woolly mammoth and Tasmanian tiger were not slated for completion until 2028.

Since then, the company introduced breakthroughs that Colossal hoped would quell the skeptics' doubts about its scientific advancements. Last month, the company announced that it engineered a mouse with mammoth-like fur. The woolly mice generated a lot of excitement. 

But clearly, with the dire wolves, the company has taken its animal creation to a new level.

The company's researchers compared the ancient DNA with the gray wolf and found that the species are 99.5% genetically identical. The scientists then used CRISPR technology to edit gray wolf cells with 20 genes that govern the dire wolf's outward appearance. The genetically modified cells were turned into embryos, which were implanted into a large domestic dog, who then gave birth to the dire wolf pups.

The result, the company claims, is the first extinct species to be brought back to life.

But many scientists who are not working for Colossal question whether they represent a true species revival.

“It is an impressive feat of genome editing, but I would not call it de-extinction,” David Gold, a professor of Paleobiology at UC Davis, told TechCrunch. “They have taken a grey wolf and modified some of its genes to mimic a dire wolf, making a sort of grey wolf / dire wolf hybrid. These animals are not being raised in a pack by other dire wolves, and they are not hunting in the wild, so I suspect their behavior will be different from a real dire wolf as well.”

That sentiment was echoed by Alexander Young, a professor of statistical genetics at UCLA, who wrote on X, “This seems massively overhyped. ‘Creating the dire wolves called for making just 20 edits in 14 genes in the common gray wolf.' In other words, it's not a dire wolf – it's a gray wolf modified to be more like a dire wolf. That's a cool achievement but they have not ‘brought the dire wolf back' sorry.”

When asked if the grey wolf genes that were edited aimed specifically at changing the external manifestations of the animal, George Church, Colossal co-founder and professor of genetics at Harvard University and MIT, told TechCrunch, “Some of them are aimed at the skull, which I think is internal.”  

He added that only 0.3% of gray wolves' genes were altered to make the dire wolf, and the remaining 0.2% variation was ultimately left unchanged.

The reason Colossal didn't use all of the dire wolf's recovered genes is because the scientists were worried those genes could cause deafness and blindness, Lamm said. “We felt, from an ethics perspective, we would not put that gene in there.”

Since we know that Remus, Romulus, and Khaleesi are not 100% identical to the animals that roamed the world until about 12,000 years ago, can we really call them de-extincted dire wolves?   

According to Gold, that's essentially a philosophical question. Another question is: Why dire wolves?

The idea for recreating the dire wolf came to Colossal by “sheer accident,” Lamm said. “We got additional capital and were looking at additional species we could work on.”

Dire wolves represented the ideal confluence of factors for a cash-rich startup that claims to be ethically conscious and has many entertainment-savvy investors on its cap table.

“We like to pair de-extinction with conservation projects,” Lamm said.

A couple of years ago, Lamm and Matt James, the chief animal officer at Colossal, learned from the government of North Carolina that red wolves are nearly extinct, with fewer than 12 animals still roaming around the state. The state had been trying to save them from disappearing. That discovery coincided with discussions with North Dakotan indigenous groups about the sacredness of wolves in their culture. And then, the company brought on George R.R. Martin, the writer of the “Game of Thrones” books, as an adviser to the company.

“It became this perfect Venn diagram. We can bring back a species that's culturally relevant, that our indigenous partners care about, and we can use the technologies to save the red wolves,” Lamm said.

The technology that Colossal used to engineer its dire wolves was also applied to create four red wolf clones. The company plans to make more red wolves and eventually re-wild them, which could save their species from extinction and increase biodiversity.

As for the plans for the dire wolves, Lamm said the company will likely create about five more animals so they can live in a pack, as wolves tend to do. Colossal is also talking to indigenous communities about possibly re-wilding the dire wolves on their lands. For now, the company scientists and animal specialists are spending time monitoring their creations' behavior and health.

Then there's another kind of question altogether: Is the science that Colossal has demonstrated enough to entice investors to fund the company at escalating valuations. Time will tell, but there are reasons to believe it could.

Lamm has laid out several potential revenue sources for the company. Colossal has already spun out two companies and plans to spin off three more businesses over the next two years, one of which will be for its artificial womb technology, which could have applications in fertility treatment.

The company may also one day start charging governments for help with endangered animal conservation. (Colossal currently provides its conservation technology at no cost, Lamm said.)

Finally, if the company successfully resurrects and reintroduces any of the species into their respective ecosystems, it may be able to generate revenue through the sale of biodiversity credits, a market-based mechanism similar to carbon credits.

These animals are not being raised in a pack by other dire wolves, and they are not hunting in the wild, so I suspect their behavior will be different from a real dire wolf as well.”

That sentiment was echoed by Alexander Young, a professor of statistical genetics at UCLA, who wrote on X, “This seems massively overhyped. ‘Creating the dire wolves called for making just 20 edits in 14 genes in the common gray wolf.' In other words, it's not a dire wolf – it's a gray wolf modified to be more like a dire wolf. That's a cool achievement but they have not ‘brought the dire wolf back' sorry.”

When asked if the grey wolf genes that were edited aimed specifically at changing the external manifestations of the animal, George Church, Colossal co-founder and professor of genetics at Harvard University and MIT, told TechCrunch, “Some of them are aimed at the skull, which I think is internal.”  

He added that only 0.3% of gray wolves' genes were altered to make the dire wolf, and the remaining 0.2% variation was ultimately left unchanged.

The reason Colossal didn't use all of the dire wolf's recovered genes is because the scientists were worried those genes could cause deafness and blindness, Lamm said. “We felt, from an ethics perspective, we would not put that gene in there.”

Since we know that Remus, Romulus, and Khaleesi are not 100% identical to the animals that roamed the world until about 12,000 years ago, can we really call them de-extincted dire wolves?   

According to Gold, that's essentially a philosophical question. Another question is: Why dire wolves?

The idea for recreating the dire wolf came to Colossal by “sheer accident,” Lamm said. “We got additional capital and were looking at additional species we could work on.”

Dire wolves represented the ideal confluence of factors for a cash-rich startup that claims to be ethically conscious and has many entertainment-savvy investors on its cap table.

“We like to pair de-extinction with conservation projects,” Lamm said.

A couple of years ago, Lamm and Matt James, the chief animal officer at Colossal, learned from the government of North Carolina that red wolves are nearly extinct, with fewer than 12 animals still roaming around the state. The state had been trying to save them from disappearing. That discovery coincided with discussions with North Dakotan indigenous groups about the sacredness of wolves in their culture. And then, the company brought on George R.R. Martin, the writer of the “Game of Thrones” books, as an adviser to the company.

“It became this perfect Venn diagram. We can bring back a species that's culturally relevant, that our indigenous partners care about, and we can use the technologies to save the red wolves,” Lamm said.

The technology that Colossal used to engineer its dire wolves was also applied to create four red wolf clones. The company plans to make more red wolves and eventually re-wild them, which could save their species from extinction and increase biodiversity.

As for the plans for the dire wolves, Lamm said the company will likely create about five more animals so they can live in a pack, as wolves tend to do. Colossal is also talking to indigenous communities about possibly re-wilding the dire wolves on their lands. For now, the company scientists and animal specialists are spending time monitoring their creations' behavior and health.

Then there's another kind of question altogether: Is the science that Colossal has demonstrated enough to entice investors to fund the company at escalating valuations. Time will tell, but there are reasons to believe it could.

Lamm has laid out several potential revenue sources for the company. Colossal has already spun out two companies and plans to spin off three more businesses over the next two years, one of which will be for its artificial womb technology, which could have applications in fertility treatment.

The company may also one day start charging governments for help with endangered animal conservation. (Colossal currently provides its conservation technology at no cost, Lamm said.)

Finally, if the company successfully resurrects and reintroduces any of the species into their respective ecosystems, it may be able to generate revenue through the sale of biodiversity credits, a market-based mechanism similar to carbon credits.

Waymo is preparing to use data from its robotaxis, including video from interior cameras tied to rider identities, to train generative AI models, according to an unreleased version of its privacy policy found by researcher Jane Manchun Wong, raising fresh questions about how much of a rider's behavior inside autonomous vehicles could be repurposed for AI training. 

The draft language also reveals Waymo may also share rider data to personalize ads. This isn't new; Waymo already collects personal data to improve services and for advertising purposes, per its existing privacy policy. 

What will change when this feature is released is that riders will have an opportunity to “opt out” of having their personal information sold, shared, or used for AI training.

“The feature, which is still under development, will not introduce any changes to Waymo's Privacy Policy, but rather will offer riders an opportunity to opt out of data collection for [machine learning] training purposes,” Julia Ilina, a Waymo spokesperson, told TechCrunch.

The unreleased privacy page states: “Waymo may share data to improve and analyze its functionality and to tailor products, services, ads, and offers to your interests. You can opt out of sharing your information with third parties, unless it's necessary to the functioning of the service.” 

That language is standard in today's world; bringing cameras into the mix is what ratchets up the creepiness factor.

“Opt out of Waymo, or its affiliates, using your personal information (including interior camera data associated with your identity) for training [generative AI],” reads the draft language of the unreleased page. 

Ilina noted that Waymo uses personal data to train AI models for safety, make sure cars are clean, find lost items, provide help in case of emergency, check that in-car rules are being followed, and generally improve products and services. 

“Any data Waymo collects will adhere to the Waymo One Privacy Policy,” Ilina said. “That policy explicitly states Waymo will not share personal information we collect through our products and services with other Alphabet companies for them to use for any purpose other than: with a users' consent, in connection with providing services to Waymo, or as otherwise described in the Privacy Policy's sharing section.”

Other Alphabet companies working on AI include Google and DeepMind. 

When asked whether Waymo will alert riders about the ability to opt out when the feature is live, or whether users will have to hunt through the app to find it themselves, Ilina said the company has not yet finalized its notification or deployment plans. 

Waymo is, to date, the only autonomous vehicle company pulling in revenue for robotaxi rides in the United States. As of February, the company is logging more than 200,000 paid robotaxi rides every week via its commercial services in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin. That's up from 10,000 rides per week just two years ago and is a harbinger of more growth as Waymo expands into new markets. The company aims to launch a commercial service in Atlanta, Miami, and Washington, D.C., over the next two years. 

Despite these gains, Waymo is still likely a money loser for Alphabet, which might be why the company appears to be exploring other revenue streams, like in-vehicle advertising and data sharing for generative AI models. 

Last year, Alphabet poured another $5 billion into Waymo, and the company raised an additional $5.6 billion from outside investors that boosted its valuation to more than $45 billion. 

Waymo is still investing heavily in R&D and incurring the costs of expansion, including growing its fleet, buying specialized equipment, vehicle maintenance, and charging infrastructure. 

It's not clear how far Waymo is from breaking even, much less profitability. Alphabet doesn't break out Waymo's financials in its earnings report. Instead, Waymo is included in Alphabet's “other bets” section of its balance sheet, which in 2024 recorded an operating loss of $1.2 billion. 

This article was originally published April 7, 2025 at 9:04 am PT. It has been updated to reflect new information from Waymo.

Like recently announced PC cases from Cooler Master and others, the Corsair Frame 4000D promises “modularity” and upgradability. But what's more important, at least in the short term, is that the Frame 4000D delivers a compelling combination of effective thermal performance in a lightweight package that's priced reasonably, at only $94.99 USD.

Will Corsair's 4000D make our list of best PC cases? Let's take a look at the specifications and features of the case, then we'll go over the features and wrap up our review with thermal testing.

▶️ Build quality

When I first picked up the box containing this case (it's available in black or white), I was surprised by how light it was. Many CPU coolers I have tested weigh more. While the individual pieces of the case will bend if separated from the other components and pressure is applied, they are well-designed and feel premium. When the parts are assembled in the case, it feels sturdy, solid, and capable.



▶️ Side view and customization options, GPU Holder



At first glance, things might seem fairly typical for a case that supports back-connect motherboards like MSI's Project Zero – cable management bar on the right, front intake next to the bar. But if you look closer, you'll notice that the motherboard tray is fully removable. And Corsair claims that billet aluminum upgrades will be available in the future.



The bottom piece covering the power supply can be black or translucent, with the latter being useful for lighting.



In the default configuration using front intake fans, there is a cable management bar with a built-in, adjustable GPU holder next to the motherboard (shown above). However, you can switch out the cable management bar with a fan-holding frame to enable the use of side intake fans (shown below).



▶️ Radiator and fan support

This case can be equipped with up to 12 fans, and supports 360mm radiators in the front, top, or side-mounted.

▶️ Dust filters, Bottom View

The case features multiple dust filters, which are fairly easy to remove.



On the bottom of the case, there's a smaller dust filter for the PSU, and four feet with rubber bottoms.



▶️ Rear side view, storage, and cable management features



The default configuration has both a cable management bar with velcro straps and a routing path with straps to keep things tidy. There are two plates supporting hard drives and SATA SSDs, one behind the motherboard highlighted in the photo above. The other is located between the PSU and the front intake fans, shown below.



Here's a more detailed look at the storage plate:





The front of the case shows off a grille with Corsair's distinct Y-design, behind which is a dust filter.



The included IO panel has (from left to right) a power button, audio jack, Two USB-A ports, and a USB-C port. As part of its modularity claims, Corsair says an upgraded IO panel will be available for purchase in Q2 2025.



The rear view seems pretty standard, but there are a few things to note that stand out from the competition.The PCIe slots are removable because the case includes support for both vertical and horizontal GPU mounting. There's also a strap handle at the top, but that's only intended to be used for removing the top tray – don't try to move the case with the strap, or you might break it!



CPU

Intel i9-14900K

CPU Cooler

Ocypus Iota A62 WH dual-tower cooler, configured with a single fan

System fans

Ocypus Gamma F12 BK ARGB

Motherboard

ASUS Z790-P Prime Wifi

GPU

MSI RTX 4070 Ti Super Ventus 3X OC



Our thermal tests are presented to give you more information about the product's performance, but aren't intended as the sole judgment of the chassis. The style, price, features, and noise levels of a case (if the case includes fans) should also be considered – and we all have different preferences. What I might like in a case, you might not, and that's OK. My goal with these reviews is to give everyone, no matter their preferences, enough information to decide whether or not a product is right for them.

With today's review, I've updated the configuration and testing methods I use for testing compared to previous reviews. For example, I used to use a single tower air cooler – but I've decided to use a dual-tower air cooler with a single fan in case reviews going forward.

The Frame 4000D can be configured in multiple ways: Both front and side-mounted intake fans are supported. For the results shown below, the case has been configured in a side-mounted configuration.

The measurements I've benchmarked this case against focus on the efficiency of the case's thermal transfer. One set of benchmarks will show performance with fans set at full speeds for maximum potential. The other set of benchmarks will show performance with system and CPU fans speeds set to 30% for those who prefer silently running systems.



The version of the Corsair Frame 4000D computer case tested today does not include fans, though versions with fans can be purchased for as little as $5 more in the US. All cases shown in the benchmarks have been tested with Ocypus Gamma F12 BK ARGB fans for consistency.

Mainframes live on.

IBM has introduced the z17, its newest mainframe system, designed for mission-critical business transactions with advanced security capabilities enhanced with AI. The system is based on the Telum II processor that offers both 70% higher general-purpose performance over its predecessor as well as 50% improved AI capabilities. For those who need even higher AI performance, IBM offers to install additional Spyre accelerators. 



IBM's Telum II processor is the heart of the company's new z17 mainframe. The Telum II CPU features eight advanced cores operating at 5.5 GHz, featuring enhanced branch prediction, store writeback, and address translation. The chip is equipped with 36MB of L2 cache, a 40% increase compared to the earlier version. It offers support for virtual L3 and L4 cache levels, expanding available cache to 360 MB and 2.88 GB, respectively. Additionally, Telum II integrates a data processing unit (DPU) to accelerate transactional workloads, which the company says increases overall system responsiveness. The chip is manufactured using Samsung's 5HPP fabrication process and contains 43 billion transistors. 

However, the Telum II does not only boast enhanced performance. A central element of this processor is its upgraded AI unit, which delivers four times the compute capability of the previous generation, reaching 24 trillion operations per second with INT8 data precision. Perhaps, 24 TOPS wasn't very impressive. However, the NPU is designed for mission-critical time-sensitive application that supports ensemble AI methods (traditional machine learning with a large-language model) to detect suspicious activities and fraud attempts. 

It should be noted that every AI unit within a processor drawer can accept tasks from any of the CPU cores. This ensures even distribution of processing demands and enables the full use of the available 192 trillion operations per second per drawer when all accelerators are active. 



IBM understands that some workloads will require more AI performance. Hence, alongside its Telum II, IBM unveiled the Spyre AI accelerator card with a PCIe interface. This 26-billion transistor processor packs 32 AI cores and features an architecture that closely resembles that of the AI accelerator architecture found in Telum II and, therefore, can be used to dynamically expand AI capabilities and performance of z17 drawers. 

"The industry is quickly learning that AI will only be as valuable as the infrastructure it runs on," said Ross Mauri, general manager of IBM Z and LinuxONE, IBM. "With z17, we are bringing AI to the core of the enterprise with the software, processing power, and storage to make AI operational quickly. Additionally, organizations can put their vast, untapped stores of enterprise data to work with AI in a secured, cost-effective way." 

To support AI workloads at the system level, IBM intends to introduce its z/OS 3.2 in Q3 2025, an updated version of its mainframe operating system. The new OS is designed to work with hardware acceleration and supports NoSQL and hybrid cloud data.

Traditionally, for IBM's z mainframes, the new z17 features robust security capabilities, including a new tool called IBM Vault, originally developed by HashiCorp to handle credentials, keys, and tokens across hybrid environments. 

The system also includes hardware-level support for data classification and anomaly detection using the inference capabilities of the Telum II CPU. 

As for storage, IBM's z17 will use the company's IBM DS8000 Gen10 system, which is designed to support high-speed transactions, availability, and scalability for mission-critical operations. 

The IBM z17 will be available starting June 18, 2025, with the Spyre Accelerator arriving later in the year.

This difference here is wonderful.dev adds points to skills based on repo stars. We take a dev's contributions to a repo, times that repo's stars, then assign those points to the repo's languages on the dev's profile. It's a proxy for impact by language.

I know the LinkedIn API is limited but it would also be cool to see a social graph of contributors you have worked with somehow. Finding the people, their titles, and companies would be valuable to see where you level (just imho).

When I search for TypeScript with location Fort Worth there is only one result.  When I change the location to Dallas there are 10 results.  Search cannot resolve results for Dallas/Fort Worth with any combination of white space.As a bonus candidate search tools never include a "negative search", as in results to exclude.  For example: TypeScript, but not React.

Frankly, I don't have much time to contribute to open source these days. I send a PR maybe once a year.Almost everything on my profile is from my university days, and none of it is related to my career specialty (ML SRE).And my employer asks me to fill out a form before I publish personal projects, so that they can be sure it is unrelated to my job (and thus that they do not have a patent or copyright claim over the code). This means most of my weekend projects simply aren't public, because I can't be bothered to do the paperwork.LinkedIn, on the other hand, clearly shows where I've worked and what I've worked on. It's a much more accurate resume for me that GitHub.

I think this tool as a whole is probably an awful way to judge a candidate. But that's not really the point. The point is to find additional candidates with a low false negative rate.E.g. over the past year I've written tens of thousands of lines of zig code. But that's not on my resume nor my LinkedIn. this would allow someone to include me. Is the code good, or am I a good candidate? Impossible to tell... Ah, but now you have heard of me! :DThere's more fluff on the page, but it's just fluff, and safe to ignore.> And my employer asks me to fill out a form before I publish personal projects, so that they can be sure it is unrelated to my job (and thus that they do not have a patent or copyright claim over the code). This means most of my weekend projects simply aren't public, because I can't be bothered to do the paperwork.Your employer is bad and they should feel bad! If you have the option you should consider changing to an employer less willing to make the world worse... or maybe a jurisdiction where that toxicity is unenforceable.

The issue isn't that not everyone has a Github presence, the issue is that for most people their Github presence is somewhat unrepresentative of their actual job skills.

GitMatcher is primarily aimed at the sourcing stage, where recruiters can find devs based on their actual code contributions. But I agree, it's not a one-size-fits-all solution — it's not meant to replace LinkedIn or fully capture your career.

This is a good idea, but it needs more work on how to tokenize and index the profiles. Are you just using the API? or storing the profiles? because API for exact matches misses a lot of profiles. The location field in GitHub has been always been inconsistent, some people use country flag emojis instead of names, or just abbreviations like AR, BO, or USA, etc

you also might want to check all the links in your footer.  all the social links are broken and the blog links to some generic content.

HN is doing a good job of complaining about all the edge cases where this won't work because most of us don't contribute high-quality, novel work to GH. For example, for me, my recent GH contributions are for an ancient video game in a niche language I've never used elsewhere and my location isn't even exposed. So I won't show up. Boo hoo.It's still a neat idea.

A few things that immediately jumped at me:- Not all code is on GitHub and not all of it is public. Recently I see more and more code moving elsewhere: GitLab (both managed and self-hosted), Codeberg, Forgejo instances.
- Even the code that is on GH might live outside of personal profile. Many notable FLOSS projects have their own organisations on GH. People who produce a lot of that code have direct commit access and don't keep forks on their profiles. You're missing all of the most prolific developers here.
- Location field in a GH profile is full of jokes. Search for “space”, “internet”, “/dev/null”, etc.
- It picks top repos weirdly. I tried to find my profile. It picked one repo that is not in my profile and wasn't there probably for a long time, and another that is a public archive and hasn't been updated since 2017. Both are forks with minimal contributions on my part. I have pinned repos in my profile that are much fresher and, arguably, more relevant.But the project looks sleek. Probably helpful in addition to Linkedin and whatever to uncover more potential candidates. I'm glad it works for you.

Both are forks with minimal contributions on my part. I have pinned repos in my profile that are much fresher and, arguably, more relevant.But the project looks sleek. Probably helpful in addition to Linkedin and whatever to uncover more potential candidates. I'm glad it works for you.

This difference here is wonderful.dev adds points to skills based on repo stars. We take a dev's contributions to a repo, times that repo's stars, then assign those points to the repo's languages on the dev's profile. It's a proxy for impact by language.

I love the concept though. Banning people from writing their own profiles makes it feel more objective/accurate even when it's not.

When I search for TypeScript with location Fort Worth there is only one result.  When I change the location to Dallas there are 10 results.  Search cannot resolve results for Dallas/Fort Worth with any combination of white space.As a bonus candidate search tools never include a "negative search", as in results to exclude.  For example: TypeScript, but not React.

An employer looking for a candidate has no reason to exclude someone with React experience though. If they want a candidate with Express.js experience, candidates may still have both. They just need the positive search in that case.

Frankly, I don't have much time to contribute to open source these days. I send a PR maybe once a year.Almost everything on my profile is from my university days, and none of it is related to my career specialty (ML SRE).And my employer asks me to fill out a form before I publish personal projects, so that they can be sure it is unrelated to my job (and thus that they do not have a patent or copyright claim over the code). This means most of my weekend projects simply aren't public, because I can't be bothered to do the paperwork.LinkedIn, on the other hand, clearly shows where I've worked and what I've worked on. It's a much more accurate resume for me that GitHub.

I think this tool as a whole is probably an awful way to judge a candidate. But that's not really the point. The point is to find additional candidates with a low false negative rate.E.g. over the past year I've written tens of thousands of lines of zig code. But that's not on my resume nor my LinkedIn. this would allow someone to include me. Is the code good, or am I a good candidate? Impossible to tell... Ah, but now you have heard of me! :DThere's more fluff on the page, but it's just fluff, and safe to ignore.> And my employer asks me to fill out a form before I publish personal projects, so that they can be sure it is unrelated to my job (and thus that they do not have a patent or copyright claim over the code).

If you have the option you should consider changing to an employer less willing to make the world worse... or maybe a jurisdiction where that toxicity is unenforceable.

The issue isn't that not everyone has a Github presence, the issue is that for most people their Github presence is somewhat unrepresentative of their actual job skills.

I know the LinkedIn API is limited but it would also be cool to see a social graph of contributors you have worked with somehow. Finding the people, their titles, and companies would be valuable to see where you level (just imho).

This is a good idea, but it needs more work on how to tokenize and index the profiles. Are you just using the API? or storing the profiles? because API for exact matches misses a lot of profiles. The location field in GitHub has been always been inconsistent, some people use country flag emojis instead of names, or just abbreviations like AR, BO, or USA, etc

Hundreds of thousands of Americans protested against President Donald Trump this past weekend in cities big and small across the country. But people like billionaire Elon Musk and right-wing influencer Laura Loomer are convinced these protests couldn't possibly be organic. In fact, Loomer has claimed that she found evidence the protests are being coordinated by shadowy foreign entities. And her conspiracy theories would be absolutely hilarious if Loomer wasn't wielding real power inside the White House right now by getting top security officials fired.

“I have exclusively confirmed that one of the busses used today to bus Muslim and radicals leftist protesters into Washington DC to protest President Trump is called SUMMER BUS TOUR INC!” Loomer tweeted on Saturday. “The registered agent for the bus is CHINESE.”

Loomer's tweet appeared to suggest that the owner of the bus being of Chinese descent was somehow evidence that the Chinese government was funding protests against Trump.

“The bus is registered out of Massachusetts and the Chinese registered agents' name is Yuxiu Wang! It appears that Chinese individuals and radical Muslims are now working together to march in support of HAMAS and ANTIFA on Capitol Hill. America is under attack!” Loomer wrote. 

What exactly does Loomer mean by “radical Muslims” working with “HAMAS and ANTIFA”? Loomer has a long history of anti-Muslim bigotry. The far-right influencer used to promote herself as the most “banned” woman in the world after being kicked off many online platforms, from Uber to PayPal, because she so frequently spreads virulent hate. Back in 2018, Loomer rather infamously chained herself to the door of an office building where Twitter employees worked to protest her ban on that platform. Loomer was reinstated in Dec. 2022 after Musk bought Twitter.

Again, Loomer's absurd theory that the nationality of someone who owns a bus would be almost funny if she didn't have real proximity to power. Loomer reportedly got several top government officials fired from their posts recently, including the director of the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command. A top Navy admiral at NATO headquarters in Brussels was the latest official to lose their job, making her the ninth person we've learned about, though it's not clear if she was fired as a direct result of Loomer's recommendations. Loomer appears to have only taken direct credit for the firing of the NSA director, though reporting from several news outlets suggests she was responsible for at least three others. Whatever the exact number, Trump has clearly been listening to Loomer's complaints, which mostly seem to be rooted in strange conspiracy theories with no basis in fact.

Loomer isn't alone in her absurd conspiracy theories about the protesters being part of some artificial operation rather than driven by real anger at the Trump regime. Musk has frequently insisted that protests, especially those against his car company Tesla, are simply a product of people paid by Democratic donors. The billionaire oligarch is currently helping dismantle the U.S. federal government with his so-called Department of Government Efficiency and insists that both peaceful protests and the arson at his dealerships around the world are a product of George Soros paying people to oppose him.

Musk even shouted “say hi to George for me” at a protester during his recent event in Wisconsin, apparently a reference to Soros. Ironically, Musk was there to hand out two $1 million checks in his bid to pay people for voting in that election. Musk was supporting a MAGA judge who lost his election, something the billionaire also suggested was somehow rigged.

The Tesla CEO has also repeatedly shared videos of protesters who are simply inarticulate and clearly shy about being on camera, pretending as though their inability to deliver a quick soundbite about their motivations for protesting prove they must be actors.

“Based on the videos I've seen so far, the worst fear of the paid Tesla ‘protestors' appears to be having to get a real job,” Musk tweeted on March 30.

There's no evidence that any of the people protesting against Trump and Musk are paid to do so. And given the hundreds of thousands who showed up at protests around the country over the weekend, that would be quite a bill to pay if you needed to shell out money to every one of them.

Your quest for the ultimate portable charger ends here. The Anker 737 Power Bank won't be a drag on your carry-on bag, backpack, or briefcase, but it will power up a MacBook and 2 other devices at the same time, and during this limited-time Amazon deal that cuts 41% off its price, it's just $88.

Everything about the Anker 737 Power Bank is impressive. It's roughly the size of a soda can and weighs only a pound and half, yet it packs a massive 24,000mAh punch with two USB-C and one USB-A ports. It has an LED smart display that shows you how much time your devices need to charge, how much juice each is getting, and how much charge the Anker 737 has left. And when that number starts to dip into the red, it takes less than an hour for it to recharge and be ready to fire up your devices again.

See at Amazon

If you're thinking the intense charging power of the Anker 737 Power Bank means it's a little too robust for your smaller items, like wireless earbuds and headphones, the USB-A port charges at 18W, which is ideal for those smaller devices and others like smart watches and tablets. If you need a little more reassurance, the Anker 737 also has Anker's ActiveShield 2.0 technology that monitors your devices as they charge and ensures they won't overheat.

But you're not buying a 24,000mAh portable charger that normally costs $150 to just recharge earbuds — any charger can do that. The Anker 737 Power Bank is the one you take on the road with you or have handy at home to keep your MacBook and your phone charged at the same time as your earbuds. The two USB-C ports can fast-charge at up to 140W.

How fast is 140W of fast-charging? Enough to get your 16-inch MacBook Pro or M3 MacBook Air from zero to 50% in just 33 minutes, or an iPhone 16 Pro or Samsung S23 to 50% in just 26 minutes.

Since the Anker 737 Power Bank meets all of TSA's boarding standards for carry-on devices, it's the perfect companion for keeping your laptop going and your devices charged on long flights. And once you reach your destination, just plug it in via the USB-C charging port and in less than an hour it's back to 100% and ready to go again.

The Anker 737 Power Bank is one of the best small portable chargers we've seen, if not the best. It's a solid purchase at its full $150 price, but when Amazon drops one of their limited-time deals like this one that knocks the price down by 41% to just $88, it's more of a “what are you waiting for?” recommendation.

It seems like new tablets have been dropping like rain lately, each one trying to one-up the other. As the tech wars escalate, however, so do the prices, and if you've been watching the news over the past week, this might not be the time for big splurges. So when Amazon keeps the price of the 10th Gen iPad just a buck above its all-time low, that's a deal worth jumping on.

This 30% off deal brings you the 10th Gen iPad in its maxed-out 256GB form to you for just $350. It's a savings of $150 off the regular retail price of the stalwart of Apple's tablet lineup. This is the iPad model we like to call the Goldilocks tablet — it's not too big, not too small, not too pricey, and not overly cheap. Everything about the 10th Gen iPad is just right.

See at Amazon

The overview of the 10th Gen iPad's features checks all the boxes for a tablet you'll use every day. It sports a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina screen that goes edge-to-edge, a new 12MP Landscape Ultra-Wide front camera and a 12MP rear camera, 4K video, Wi-Fi 6E, and the powerful A14 Bionic processor chipset to drive them all.

The headline, of course, is the $350 price tag, which really stands out when you line it up with the $999 starting price of the iPad Pro, the $599 tag on the iPad Air, and even the iPad Mini's $499. The features of the 10th Gen iPad stand up with its pricier cousins, with USB-C charging, compatibility with the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard Folio, and 10-hour battery life. The biggest difference is the price.

The 10th Gen iPad was released in 2022, and there have literally been dozens of tablets released since then, by Apple and its many competitors. And yet, the 10th Gen iPad still stands very high on the best-of lists, and that's due to its combination of processing power, top-end features, and price. It runs the latest version of iPadOS, has all of the essential iPad apps, and the industry-best Apple Liquid Retina screen.

Amazon's 30% sale on the 10th Gen iPad, available in four colors, lands it a mere dollar above its all-time lowest price, and well below its regular $500 retail price. It's also an incredible price considering this is the fully-loaded 256GB version of the 10th Gen iPad. We're not sure when that price is going to go back up, so hit Amazon now just to be safe.

Hafnium oxide FeRAM can combine high capacity and non-volatility.

Ferroelectric Memory Co. (FMC) has joined forces with Neumonda to reestablish production of the so-called DRAM+ in Germany. It's been a while since Infineon and Qimonda developed and produced dynamic random access memory in Germany, as it became particularly unprofitable to build commodity memory in Europe. However, the new FMC and Neumonda venture will focus on non-volatile FeRAM aimed at specific applications. 

FMC specializes in memory that uses ferroelectric hafnium oxide (HfO₂) to create DRAM+ that retains data without power. The technology replaces the typical capacitor in DRAM with a non-volatile version, keeping performance high while adding energy efficiency and data retention. FMC believes that its memory could be used for a wide range of applications, including AI, automotive, consumer, industrial, and medical.

Older FeRAM technologies (typically using lead zirconate titanate, or PZT, as the ferroelectric layer) were limited in capacity. Most commercial products topped out at a few megabytes, with 4MB or 8MB being quite common. PZT does not scale well with shrinking process nodes, and integration with standard CMOS processes is difficult and costly. As a result, cell structures like 1T1C (one transistor, one capacitor) consumed more area than DRAM or NAND. 

The move to hafnium oxide is a game-changer. HfO₂ is CMOS-compatible, scales well below 10nm, and can be integrated with existing semiconductor manufacturing processes. Therefore, its usage enables higher densities and performance, potentially in the gigabit to gigabyte range, putting it closer to DRAM. 

"FMC was founded to exploit the disruptive invention of the ferroelectric effect of HfO2 for semiconductor memories. Applied to a DRAM, it turns the DRAM capacitor into a low power, nonvolatile storage device while maintaining the high DRAM performance to produce a disruptive nonvolatile DRAM memory ideal for AI compute," explained Thomas Rueckes, CEO of FMC. "Since our technology is unique in the market, cost-effective testing of our memory products is of great importance for our product offerings. With Neumonda and its radically new approach to testing, we have found a partner that can help us speed up the development of our products. We also are excited to work with Neumonda as we share the common vision to bring Memory back to Europe." 

Neumonda will support FMC by consulting and providing access to its advanced test systems: Rhinoe, Octopus, and Raptor. These platforms are designed for low-cost, energy-efficient, and independent memory testing. Neumonda's systems offer detailed analysis that is not possible with traditional equipment and operate at significantly lower cost. 

Together, the two companies are advancing a new memory product and also laying the groundwork for a broader revival of European semiconductor capabilities. Their combined efforts aim to rebuild a local ecosystem for advanced memory design and testing.

"As our test platforms are maturing, FMC's products are an ideal test ground to prove the capabilities of our Rhinoe, Octopus, and Raptor testers, as well as the high-quality yield they enable," explained Peter Poechmueller, CEO of Neumonda. "One of my personal goals behind founding Neumonda was to bring semiconductor memory back to Europe. With this collaboration, we take a big step closer to establishing a new German memory manufacturer."

Nvidia may see some hope in the face of historic losses.

Around 60% of Nvidia's DGX and HGX AI datacenter servers may completely avoid recent U.S. tariffs, thanks to their production in Mexico. Stacy Rasgon, writing for Bernstein Private Wealth Management and one of the market's top chip analysts, found that the majority of Nvidia's datacenters going to U.S. hyperscalers might just arrive tariff-free.

In a memo sent to Bernstein clients, Rasgon highlighted fears from investors over the oncoming fate of Nvidia, as while semiconductors have been largely exempted from the "Liberation Day" tariff sweep, server hardware has not. "Analysis suggests the majority of [Nvidia's] US AI server shipments likely come from Mexico," writes Rasgon.

Nvidia's own export regulations website highlights that Nvidia's DGX and HGX servers are sorted under the U.S.'s Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) codes within categories that are exempt from U.S.-Mexico tariffs (8471.50 and 8471.80). This is thanks to the USMCA trade agreement between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico signed in Trump's first term, which lists digital and automatic data processing units as compliant product tags exempt from new tariffs.

It should be noted that the 60% estimate is not an exact percentage. The United States' import data for server-related categories 8471.50 and 8471.80 shows $73 billion of imports in 2024, with around 60% coming from Mexico, and around 30% from Taiwan. This is the data for all server imports entering the United States in 2024, not just Nvidia, though Nvidia's market dominance suggests that this general ratio represents the GPU maker appropriately.

While Nvidia consumer-grade GPUs also fall under protection from tariffs within USMCA, it is unlikely that Nvidia's consumer supply chain flows through Mexico as much as its server hardware does, though the USMCA agreement may see use as a loophole for companies like Nvidia if tariffs continue to increase.

Jensen Huang, longtime Nvidia CEO, has been optimistic about Nvidia's standing in the face of the threat of tariffs. During GTC 2025, Huang claimed, "In the near term, the impact of tariffs will not be meaningful." This bold confidence seemed laughable after Nvidia stock took a terrible stock tumble, but it seems prescient now. Nvidia's server footprint in Mexico is large, and is set to grow even larger as Foxconn completes production this year on its Chihuahua plant dedicated to manufacturing more Nvidia server hardware.

While Nvidia's outlook for AI server imports looks rosy, the average gamer and tech enthusiast will suffer in the wake of new tariffs issued from the United States government. U.S. PC system integrators, especially boutique brands, are set to increase prices by at least 20% in response to tariffs, as price increases come for virtually all consumer PC components. Time will tell whether the new wave of tariffs will last long, but as long as they do, hyperscalers can breathe easy while PC consumers may begin to sweat.

Politicians were also responsible for initially subsidizing solar to usher in the current boom.Corporations invested heavily in solar production to create the cheap panels that are being installed rapidly.Just because some politicians and corporations do things we don't like doesn't make them in general “the biggest enemy of humanity.”

Now, their prices have gone down, their generation per unit has gone up, and much more is known about how they behave long-term.The world has a LOT of power generation. It will take time to replace. But with every time that some existing power generation source shuts down due to age, or expansion occurs somewhere, it will inevitably be done with Solar/Wind. It's just more cost effective now.In the end it is not environmental concerns that will cause solar and wind to become commonplace. It's just economics. Slapping down something that generates power for 20-30 years with no input fuel is just way more economically feasible than anything that requires fuel. They still have maintenance costs, but it's nothing by comparison. They can completely undercut other sources of power.

The 2025 Ford Maverick remains the sole compact pickup truck on sale in North America—and it's been a smash success since it launched, with Ford adding a third shift at its plant to meet the demand. That suggests not every American pickup buyer needs something the size of Ford's F-Series, which remains the best-selling vehicle line in the US after four decades.

In particular, the Maverick made headlines in 2022 by offering a hybrid version that returned a 37 mpg combined EPA rating—against 26 mpg for its non-hybrid counterpart. Now, in its fourth model year, Ford has added the feature most requested by Maverick Hybrid buyers: all-wheel drive. And it's rated at the same 37 mpg, no less.

However, a storm cloud hovers over the new feature and the new model year: All Mavericks are made in Mexico, meaning they may well be subject to an import tariff—though details of how or whether that may be applied remain in flux at the time of writing.

The Maverick retains the clever design features that won acclaim when it launched. Slots in the FlexBed accept many sizes and types of lumber, while a half-open position for the tailgate lets DIYers carry flat boards. Owners who fancy themselves "makers” can wire their own LED bed lights—Ford built in a plug connector just for them.

Still, it's the AWD Hybrid that's the big news this year. And it turned out to require more work than simply swapping in a second driveshaft and a rear axle. Ford had to design an entirely new generation of its two-motor hybrid transaxle to make it work. For 2025, the previous third-generation system (known as HF45) has been replaced by a far more powerful fourth-gen system (HF55). WIRED got the details during almost an hour with Abby Grajek, the Maverick's vehicle integration engineer—which in non-Detroit terms means she's responsible for ensuring every performance target and user need specified for the vehicle is translated onto the assembly line and, hopefully, delivered properly.

The Maverick's Ford C2 platform is fundamentally oriented toward front-wheel-drive powertrains, as found in the Ford Escape (North America) and Kuga (in Europe), the soon-to-be-discontinued Europe-only Focus, and the Lincoln Corsair among others. When AWD was needed for the truck, Ford stuck with a traditional mechanical system that takes the combined power output of the engine and hybrid system and splits it between two drive units: one for the front wheels, one for the rear. This stands in contrast to Toyota and other hybrid makers, who use a small e-motor on the rear axle to add incremental power on demand.

The AWD Maverick Hybrid had to provide the same towing capacity as its turbo 2.0-liter gasoline counterpart, meaning a tow rating of up to 4,000 pounds if the “4K towing option” is specified. In practical terms, that meant that when towing, the total output of the engine and hybrid system had to be high enough to power a 3,850-pound vehicle, up to four occupants and cargo, plus a 4,000-pound trailer—effectively hauling a second vehicle, meaning double the weight the previous hybrid system had to tow. The new transaxle's internal cooling had to be robust enough to tow that combined weight up a steep grade for many miles without the electric motors overheating.

By comparison, the tow rating for the Escape Hybrid is a paltry 1,500 pounds, and the previous Escape Hybrid, in FWD-only form, was rated at 2,000 pounds. Even that 2,000-pound rating had required a change to the motor design of the previous HF45 system to improve lubricant flow to ensure sufficient cooling under maximum load. The new HF55 system had to do far better. “We weren't confident the previous system would do [everything] necessary” to provide the proper towing capacity and performance, said Grajek.

To deliver that performance, every component of the new HF55 hybrid transaxle (now used in all Maverick Hybrid versions) is uprated while continuing to fit within the same package size as its predecessor. Torque from the drive motor rises from 235 to 320 Newton-meters (173 to 236 pound-feet), while the generator's power output goes from 78 to 96 kilowatts (105 to 129 horsepower).

The new motors, combined with an essentially unchanged 2.5-liter Atkinson Cycle inline-4, boosts maximum powertrain output to 142 kW (191 hp) at (an unspecified) peak battery output. The hybrid engine turns out to run cooler overall (likely due to the added power supplied by the traction motor), meaning it delivers better cooling performance, even when towing, than the 2.0-liter turbo alternative: Grajek noted that even with the 4K package, Maverick Hybrids retained the standard radiator rather than the uprated version required for the turbo powertrain.

For better off-the-line performance, the rear axle ratio is raised to 3.37:1 from 2.91:1. Despite that, on-road performance improves: Ford says the 0-to-60-mph acceleration time is cut by 18 percent to 6.8 seconds, while a critical highway-passing-time metric improves roughly 10 percent.

The EPA ratings speak for themselves: A 2025 Maverick Hybrid gets a combined rating of 38 mpg in FWD form and loses only 1 mpg when AWD is added. So when this 37-mpg compact pickup, with four seats, can tow up to 4,000 pounds—what's not to like? (Like all hybrids, its city rating of 40 mpg AWD or 42 mpg FWD is higher than its highway rating, since the truck will operate on electric power only during some lower-speed usage.)

Other changes to all Maverick models for 2025 include a larger center touchscreen, now 13.2 inches, and a standard 8-inch digital instrument cluster on every trim. Wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay is now standard—another much-requested owner item—as is Sync 4, with the pale blue-and-white user interface familiar to Mustang Mach-E owners.

For 2025, all models include an onboard Wi-Fi hot spot. Options among various trim levels include wireless smartphone charging, a high-end B&O Play stereo system, and SiriusXM satellite radio. The XL, XLT, luxury Lariat, and off-road Tremor trim levels carry over—with the AWD Hybrid available on all but Tremor.

Behind the wheel, drivers enjoy good outward visibility from the upright cabin–better than most compact SUVs these days. The rotary shift selector takes a bit of getting used to but allows for two generous cupholders in the console. Once underway, certain road surfaces produce noticeable tire noise (at least in our XLT test truck), but like most modern hybrids, Ford has significantly tamed engine roar—to the point the engine switching on is often imperceptible.

Happily, the Maverick drives more like a compact car than a pickup truck, though the stiffer springs required for its 1,400-pound payload and trailer-towing abilities make its unladen ride a touch on the stiff side. Fully laden, it's slower but rides more smoothly. Either way, on twisty roads it's the least “truck-y” pickup Ford sells by far—which is one of its most appealing features.

Two new tech options should let Maverick owners maneuver and hitch their trailers with less hassle. The Pro Trailer Hitch Assist uses rear corner radars and a camera to align the trailer coupler (once raised to a suitable height) with the truck's tow ball. While such features have been offered on full-size pickups from Ford, GM, and others, the Maverick is the smallest truck to offer them. Once activated, the system identifies the trailer's extremities, then controls the truck's steering, braking, and reversing speed to position the coupler over the hitch ball. We tested it; it worked remarkably well.

The Pro Trailer Backup Assist lets owners reverse their truck and attach a trailer by simply turning a knob to indicate which direction the trailer should go while reversing the combination. This is often among the hardest trailering skills for novices to learn; this system, Ford suggests, should make that task easier. WIRED still parked the trailer atop a couple of cones on our first try, but with practice it should get significantly more natural.

Regrettably, we weren't able to test the towing performance of the Maverick Hybrid AWD in real-world circumstances (unlike the 2022 launch event which included towing segments). We look forward to doing so once we get a test vehicle for longer than several hours.

For this year at least, the 4K Towing option is available on the AWD Maverick Hybrid only in its top trim level, known as Lariat. The Pro Trailer Hitch Assist and Backup Assist functions are standard on the Lariat version.

Unfortunately, Maverick prices have risen significantly in its fourth year. In 2022, the entry-level Maverick carried a base price under $21,500—meaning dealers often added significant markups due to limited production capacity for a red-hot model. Now, the cheapest Maverick is more than $7,000 pricier, at $28,590 including mandatory delivery fee. WIRED's trial Maverick Hybrid AWD in XLT trim has a MSRP of $36,860, with the color option called Eruption Green.

As mentioned, so popular is the Maverick that the Mexico assembly plant, in Hermosillo, is now running three shifts a day, supplying pickups not just to North America but also to a variety of countries in South America—where it's essentially a mainstream pickup.

But the US government announced new import tariffs on virtually all imports last week while we were on the drive event. This could add 25 percent to the sticker of every Maverick—though Ford hasn't done that, at least so far. Instead, the day after the announcement, Ford said it would extend “employee pricing” (a special discounted rate usually offered to company employees and their families) to virtually every Ford buyer.

Meta is introducing Teen Accounts to Facebook and Messenger. The feature, which automatically enrolls young users into an app experience with built-in protections, will be available on these platforms in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and Canada before expanding to additional regions in the future.

Teen Accounts first rolled out to Instagram last September after Instagram and other popular social networks were grilled by U.S. lawmakers for not doing enough to protect teens. As part of Tuesday's announcement, Meta said it's bringing new built-in protections for Teen Accounts on Instagram.

With the expansion to Facebook and Messengers, teens will automatically be placed into an experience that is designed to limit inappropriate content and unwanted contact. Teens under the age of 16 need their parents' permission to change any of the settings.

While Meta's blog post about the launch doesn't share the exact restrictions that teens will be placed under, the company told TechCrunch in an email that teens will only receive messages from people they follow or have messaged before.

In addition, only teens' friends can see and reply to their stories. Tags, Mentions, and comments will also be limited to people they follow or who are their friends.

Teens will also receive reminders to leave the social networks after using them for an hour a day. Plus, they will be enrolled into “Quiet mode” overnight. 

As for the new restrictions on Instagram, teens under 16 will not be allowed to go live on the platform unless their parents give them permission to do so. Plus, teens under 16 will need to get parental permission to turn off the app's feature that blurs images containing suspected nudity in DMs.

The changes announced on Tuesday demonstrate Meta's latest step toward addressing teen mental health concerns tied to social media. These concerns have been raised by the U.S. Surgeon General and several states, some of which have even begun restricting teens from using social media without a parent's consent.

Meta has shared some insight into how Teen Accounts are doing on Instagram, as the company says it has moved 54 million teens into Teen Accounts. Meta says there are still many more to go, as the feature continues to roll out globally. The company also shared that 97% of teens ages 13-15 keep their built-in protections on, Meta says.

Meta also commissioned a study conducted by Ipsos that found that nearly all parents surveyed (94%) say Teen Accounts are helpful for parents, and 85% think they make it easier to help their teens have positive experiences on Instagram.

Colossal Biosciences claims it has revived an extinct species, but scientists outside the company are skeptical.

Somewhere in the northern US, drones fly over a 2,000-acre preserve, protected by a nine-foot fence built to zoo standards. It is off-limits to curious visitors, especially those with a passion for epic fantasies or mythical creatures.

The reason for such tight security? Inside the preserve roam three striking snow-white wolves—which a startup called Colossal Biosciences says are members of a species that went extinct 13,000 years ago, now reborn via biotechnology.

For several years now, the Texas-based company has been in the news for its plans to re-create woolly mammoths someday. But now it's making a bold new claim—that it has actually “de-extincted” an animal called the dire wolf.

And that could be another reason for the high fences and secret location—to fend off scientific critics, some of whom have already been howling that the company is a “scam” perpetrating “elephantine fantasies” on the public and engaging in “pure hype.”

Dire wolves were large, big-jawed members of the canine family. More than 400 of their skulls have been recovered from the La Brea Tar Pits in California. Ultimately they were replaced by smaller relatives like the gray wolf.

In its effort to re-create the animal, Colossal says, it extracted DNA information from dire wolf bones and used gene editing to introduce some of those elements into cells from gray wolves. It then used a cloning procedure to turn the cells into three actual animals. 

The animals include two males, Romulus and Remus, born in October, and one female, Khaleesi, whose name is a reference to the TV series Game of Thrones, in which fictional dire wolves play a part.

Each animal, the company says, has 20 genetic changes across 14 genes designed to make them larger, change their facial features, and give them a snow-white appearance.

Some scientists reject the company's claim that the new animals are a revival of the extinct creatures, since in reality dire wolves and gray wolves are different species separated by a few million of years of evolution and several million letters of DNA.

“I would say such an animal is not a dire wolf and it's not correct to say dire wolves have been brought back from extinction. It's a modified gray wolf,” says Anders Bergström, a professor at the University of East Anglia who specializes in the evolution of canines. “Twenty changes is not nearly enough. But it could get you a strange-looking gray wolf.”

Human “bodyoids” could reduce animal testing, improve drug development, and alleviate organ shortages.

Beth Shapiro, an expert on ancient DNA who is now on a three-year sabbatical from the University of California, Santa Cruz, as the company's CSO, acknowledged in an interview that other scientists would bristle at the claim.

“What we're going to have here is a philosophical argument about whether we should call it a dire wolf or call it something else,” Shapiro said. Asked point blank to call the animal a dire wolf, she hesitated but then did so.

“It is a dire wolf,” she said. “I feel like I say that, and then all of my taxonomist friends will be like, ‘Okay, I'm done with her.' But it's not a gray wolf. It doesn't look like a gray wolf.”

Dire or not, the new wolves demonstrate that science is becoming more deft in its control over the genomes of animals—and point to how that skill could help in conservation. As part of the project, Colossal says, it also cloned several red wolves, an American species that's the most endangered wolf in the world.

But that isn't as dramatic as the supposed rebirth of an extinct animal with a large cultural following. “The motivation really is to develop tools that we can use to stop species from becoming extinct. Do we need ancient DNA for that? Maybe not,” says Shapiro. “Does it bring more attention to it so that maybe people get excited about the idea that we can use biotechnology for conservation? Probably.”

Colossal was founded in 2021 after founder Ben Lamm, a software entrepreneur, visited the Harvard geneticist George Church and learned about a far-out and still mostly theoretical project to re-create woolly mammoths. The idea is to release herds of them in cold regions, like Siberia, and restore an ecological balance that keeps greenhouse gases trapped in the permafrost.

Lamm has unexpectedly been able to raise more than $400 million from investors to back the plan, and Forbes reported that he is now a multibillionaire, at least on paper, thanks to the $10 billion value assigned to the startup.

As Lamm showed he could raise money for Colossal's ideas, it soon expanded beyond its effort to modify elephants. It publicly announced a bid to re-create the thylacine, a marsupial predator hunted to extinction, and then, in 2023, it started planning to resurrect the dodo bird—the effort that brought Shapiro to the company.

So far, none of those signature projects have actually resulted in a live animal with ancient genes. 

Each faces dire practical issues. With elephants, it was that their pregnancies last two years, longer than those in any other species. Testing out mammoth designs would be impossibly slow. With the dodo bird, it was that no one has ever figured out how to genetically modify the pigeon, the most closely related species from which to craft a dodo via editing. One of Lamm's other favorite targets—the Steller's sea cow, which disappeared around 1770—has no obvious surrogate of any kind.   

But creating a wolf was feasible. Over 1,500 dogs had been cloned, primarily by one company in South Korea. Researchers in Asia had even used dog eggs and dog mothers to produce both coyote and wolf clones. That's not surprising, since all these species are closely enough related to interbreed.

“Just thinking about surrogacy for the dire wolf … it was like ‘Oh, yeah,'” recalls Shapiro. “Surrogacy there would be really straightforward.”

Dire wolves did present some new problems. One was the lack of any clear ecological purpose in reviving animals that disappeared during the Pleistocene epoch and are usually portrayed as ferocious predators with slavering jaws. “People have weird feelings about things that, you know, may or may not eat people or livestock,” Shapiro says.

The technical challenge was there was still no accurate DNA sequence of a dire wolf. A 2021 effort to obtain DNA from old bones had yielded only a tiny amount, not enough to accurately decode the genome in detail. And without a detailed gene map, Colossal wouldn't be able see what genetic differences they would need to install in gray wolves, the species they intended to alter.

Shapiro says she went back to museums, including the Idaho Museum of Natural History, and eventually got permission to cut off more bone from a 72,0000-year-old skull that's on display there. She also got a tooth from a 13,000-year-old skull held in another museum. which she drilled into herself.

This time the bones yielded far more DNA and a much more complete gene map. A paper describing the detailed sequence is being submitted for publication; its authors include George R.R. Martin, the fantasy author whose books were turned into the HBO series Game of Thrones, and in which dire wolves appear as the characters' magical companions.

In addition to placing dire wolves more firmly in the Canidae family tree (they're slightly closer to jackals than to gray wolves, but more than 99.9% identical to both at a genetic level) and determining when dire wolves split from the pack (about 4 to 5 million years ago), the team also located around 80 genes where dire wolves seemed to be most different. If you wanted to turn a gray wolf into a dire wolf, this would be the obvious list to start from.

Colossal then began the process of using base editing, an updated form of the CRISPR gene-modification technique, to introduce some of those exact DNA variations into blood cells of a gray wolf kept in its labs. Each additional edit, the company  hoped, would make the eventual animal a little more dire-wolf-like, even it involved changing just a single letter of a gene.

Shapiro says all the edits using information from the ancient dire wolf were made to “genetic enhancers,” bits of DNA that help control how strongly certain genes are expressed. These can influence how big animals grow, as well as affecting the shape of their ears, faces, and skulls. This tactic was not as dramatic as intervening right in the middle of a gene, which would change what protein is made. But it was less risky—more like turning knobs on an unfamiliar radio than cutting wires and replacing circuits.

That left the scientists to engineer into the animals what would become their showstopper trait—the dramatic white fur. Shapiro says the genome code indicated that dire wolves might have had light coats. But the specific pigment genes involved are linked to a risk of albinism, deafness, and blindness, and they didn't want sick wolves.

That's when Colossal opted for a shortcut. Instead of reproducing precise DNA variants seen in dire wolves, they disabled two genes entirely. In dogs and other species, the absence of those genes is known to produce light fur. 

The decision to make the wolves white did result in dramatic photos of the animals. “It's the most striking thing about them,” says Mairin Balisi, a paleontologist who studies dire wolf fossils. But she doubts it reflects what the animals actually looked like: “A white coat might make sense if you are in a snowy landscape, but one of the places where dire wolves were most abundant was around Los Angeles and the tar pits, and it was not a snowy landscape even in the Ice Age. If you look at mammals in this region today, they are not white. I am just confused by the declaration that dire wolves are back.”

Bergström also says he doesn't think the edits add up to a dire wolf. “I doubt that 20 changes are enough to turn a gray wolf to a dire wolf. You'd probably need hundreds or thousands of changes—no one really knows,” he says. “This is one of those unsolved questions in biology. People argue [about] the extent to which many small differences make a species distinct, versus a small number of big-effect differences. Nobody knows, but I lean to the ‘many small differences' view.”

Some genes have big, visible effects—changing a single gene can make a dog hairless, for instance. But it might be many more small changes that account for the difference in size and appearance between, say, a Great Dane and a Chihuahua. And that is just looks. Bergström says science has much less idea which changes would account for behavior—even if we could tell from a genome how an extinct animal acted, which we can't.

“A lot of people are quite skeptical of what they are doing,” Bergström says of Colossal. “But I still think it's interesting that someone is trying. It takes a lot of money and resources, and if we did have the technology to bring species back from extinction, I do think that would be useful. We drive species to extinction, sometimes very rapidly, and that is a shame.”

By last August, the gray wolf cells had been edited, and it was time to try cloning those cells and producing animals. Shapiro says her company transferred 40 to 50 cloned embryos apiece into six surrogate dogs. That led to three pregnancies, from which four dogs were born. One of the four, Khaleesi's sister, died 10 days after birth from an intestinal infection, deemed unrelated to the cloning process. “That was the only puppy that didn't make it,” says Shapiro. Two other fetal clones were reabsorbed during pregnancy, which means they disintegrated, a fairly common occurrence in dogs.

These days the white wolves are able to freely roam around a large area. They don't have radio collars, but they are watched by cameras and are trained to come to their caretakers to get fed, which offers a chance to weigh them as they cross a scale in the ground. The 10 staff members attending to them can see them up close, though they're now too big to handle the way the caretakers could when they were puppies.

Whatever species these animals are, it's not obvious what their future will be. They don't seem to have a conservation purpose, and Lamm says he isn't trying to profit from them.

“We're not making money off the dire wolves. That's not our business plan,” Lamm said in an interview with MIT Technology Review. He added that the animals would also not be put on display for the public, since “we're not in the business of attractions.”

Ancient DNA is telling us more and more about humans and environments long past. Could it also help rescue the future?

At least not in-person attractions. But every aspect of the project has been filmed, and in February, the company inked a deal to produce a docuseries about its exploits. That same month it also hired as its marketing chief a Hollywood executive who previously worked on big-budget “monster movies.”

And there are signs that de-extinction, in Colossal's hands, has the potential to generate nearly out-of-control of attention, much like that scene in the original King Kong when the giant ape—captured by a filmmaker—breaks its chains under the flashes of the cameras.

For instance company's first creation, mice with shaggy, mammoth-like hair, was announced only five weeks ago, yet there are already unauthorized sales of throw pillows and T-shirts (they read “Legalize Woolly Mice”), as well as some “serious security issues” involving unannounced visitors, Lamm says.

“We've had people show up to our labs because they want the woolly mouse,” Lamm says. “We're worried about that from a security perspective [for] the wolves, because you're going to have all the Game of Thrones people. You're going to have a lot of people that want to see these animals.”  

Lamm said that in light of his concerns about unruly fans, diagrams of the ecological preserve provided to the media had been altered so that no internet “sleuths” could use them to guess its location. 

Human “bodyoids” could reduce animal testing, improve drug development, and alleviate organ shortages.

Why archaeologists are increasingly leaving historic sites untouched until we have less destructive technologies for studying them. 

The animals, the first to have been created by Colossal Biosciences, have fluffy coats and curly whiskers.

But truly deleting your personal genetic information from the DNA testing company is easier said than done.

Billing itself as “Stripe for emerging markets,” Turkish Fintech Sipay has raised a $78 million Series B funding round, claiming a valuation of $875 million in the process. 

This round is significant, as Sipay plans to expand into markets outside of Turkey, offering additional services like remittances that Stripe currently does not offer in those regions.

The all-equity round was led by U.S.-based Elephant VC, with participation from Revolut co-founder Nik Storonsky's VC firm, QuantumLight.

Founded in 2019, Sipay operates an all-in-one app for managing digital wallets, investments and loyalty schemes, and offers embedded finance, FX transactions and other products. It works with partners including Visa and Mastercard, integrating with Turkish banks as well as large e-commerce providers such as Trendyol in Turkey. It has 6.3 million wallet users and 25,000 registered merchants.

Sipay claims it's been profitable since 2023, and its revenue has increased 5x year-on-year. The company says it ended last year with run-rate revenue of $600 million.

“Stripe is sorting out one single problem, but there is no all-in-one fintech solution in our markets,” Nezih Sipahioğlu, founder and global CEO of Sipay, said. “So that's why we have different products.”

“Our services run as a white label, similar to Solaris Bank in the U.K. So any fintech that wants to issue their own card or wallet can do it through us,” he said.

He added that the startup bootstrapped its growth until June 2024, when it raised a $15 million Series A funding round that was led by Anfa. 

“As markets become more globalized, Sipay's focus on cross-border payment solutions will help drive international growth and trade,” Peter Fallon, general partner at Elephant VC, said in a statement.

Apple is considering importing more iPhones from India to side-step the 54% additional tariffs on goods imported from China that U.S. President Donald Trump announced last week, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing anonymous sources. 

The company sees this as a short-term measure while it seeks to negotiate with the Trump administration to get an exemption from the tariffs, as it doesn't yet want to revamp its supply chain built around China, the report said.

Compared to the new 54% tariffs on Chinese-made goods, the U.S. has proposed a 26% tariffs on goods imported from India. If the tariffs aren't brought down and Apple continues to import iPhones from China, an iPhone 16 Pro that cost $550 to import before tariffs, could cost an additional $300 now.

Apple was on track to make 25 million iPhones in India this year, with 10 million units for the local market, the Wall Street Journal cited Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan as saying. He said that if Apple decided to import all 25 million iPhones to the U.S., it would satisfy about 50% of the demand in the U.S. market.

Designed to be the perfect person—always available, never critical—AI companions are hooking people deeper than social media ever could. They make the attention economy look like a relic.

On Tuesday, California state senator Steve Padilla will make an appearance with Megan Garcia, the mother of a Florida teen who killed himself following a relationship with an AI companion that Garcia alleges contributed to her son's death. 

The two will announce a new bill that would force the tech companies behind such AI companions to implement more safeguards to protect children. They'll join other efforts around the country, including a similar bill from California State Assembly member Rebecca Bauer-Kahan that would ban AI companions for anyone younger than 16 years old, and a bill in New York that would hold tech companies liable for harm caused by chatbots. 

You might think that such AI companionship bots—AI models with distinct “personalities” that can learn about you and act as a friend, lover, cheerleader, or more—appeal only to a fringe few, but that couldn't be further from the truth. 

A new research paper aimed at making such companions safer, by authors from Google DeepMind, the Oxford Internet Institute, and others, lays this bare: Character.AI, the platform being sued by Garcia, says it receives 20,000 queries per second, which is about a fifth of the estimated search volume served by Google. Interactions with these companions last four times longer than the average time spent interacting with ChatGPT. One companion site I wrote about, which was hosting sexually charged conversations with bots imitating underage celebrities, told me its active users averaged more than two hours per day conversing with bots, and that most of those users are members of Gen Z. 

The design of these AI characters makes lawmakers' concern well warranted. The problem: Companions are upending the paradigm that has thus far defined the way social media companies have cultivated our attention and replacing it with something poised to be far more addictive. 

In the social media we're used to, as the researchers point out, technologies are mostly the mediators and facilitators of human connection. They supercharge our dopamine circuits, sure, but they do so by making us crave approval and attention from real people, delivered via algorithms. With AI companions, we are moving toward a world where people perceive AI as a social actor with its own voice. The result will be like the attention economy on steroids.

Social scientists say two things are required for people to treat a technology this way: It needs to give us social cues that make us feel it's worth responding to, and it needs to have perceived agency, meaning that it operates as a source of communication, not merely a channel for human-to-human connection. Social media sites do not tick these boxes. But AI companions, which are increasingly agentic and personalized, are designed to excel on both scores, making possible an unprecedented level of engagement and interaction. 

In an interview with podcast host Lex Fridman, Eugenia Kuyda, the CEO of the companion site Replika, explained the appeal at the heart of the company's product. “If you create something that is always there for you, that never criticizes you, that always understands you and understands you for who you are,” she said, “how can you not fall in love with that?”

So how does one build the perfect AI companion? The researchers point out three hallmarks of human relationships that people may experience with an AI: They grow dependent on the AI, they see the particular AI companion as irreplaceable, and the interactions build over time. The authors also point out that one does not need to perceive an AI as human for these things to happen. 

Now consider the process by which many AI models are improved: They are given a clear goal and “rewarded” for meeting that goal. An AI companionship model might be instructed to maximize the time someone spends with it or the amount of personal data the user reveals. This can make the AI companion much more compelling to chat with, at the expense of the human engaging in those chats.

For example, the researchers point out, a model that offers excessive flattery can become addictive to chat with. Or a model might discourage people from terminating the relationship, as Replika's chatbots have appeared to do. The debate over AI companions so far has mostly been about the dangerous responses chatbots may provide, like instructions for suicide. But these risks could be much more widespread.

We're on the precipice of a big change, as AI companions promise to hook people deeper than social media ever could. Some might contend that these apps will be a fad, used by a few people who are perpetually online. But using AI in our work and personal lives has become completely mainstream in just a couple of years, and it's not clear why this rapid adoption would stop short of engaging in AI companionship. And these companions are poised to start trading in more than just text, incorporating video and images, and to learn our personal quirks and interests. That will only make them more compelling to spend time with, despite the risks. Right now, a handful of lawmakers seem ill-equipped to stop that.

The new general AI agent from China had some system crashes and server overload—but it's highly intuitive and shows real promise for the future of AI helpers.

What the firm found challenges some basic assumptions about how this technology really works.

These newer models appear more likely to indulge in rule-bending behaviors than previous generations—and there's no way to stop them.

We're starting to get a better sense of how chatbots are affecting us—but there's still a lot we don't know.

The privacy risks posed by the artificial intelligence industry are slowly coming into view. Alphabet's robotaxi business, Waymo, says it may use videos of passengers captured by in-vehicle cameras to sell ads and train its AI models.

TechCrunch reports that the unreleased policy was originally spotted by reliable software researcher Jane Manchun Wong, who posted about it on X on Saturday. A screenshot provided by Wong shows the terms of use that the robotaxi company plans to ask riders to comply with. An opt-out option is provided to comply with California's privacy law. It's not entirely clear how Wong was able to access the new policy that hasn't been shared publicly but Wong is known for digging through companies' software and finding unreleased updates.

The screenshot of the policy states: “Waymo may share data to improve and analyze its functionality and to tailor products, services, ads, and offers to your interests. You can opt out of sharing your information with third parties, unless it's necessary to the functioning of the service.”

Wong has noted that the new policy will have an opt-out option for California riders, to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act—one of the only comprehensive state privacy laws in the country. The CCPA allows residents to access and delete data that has been collected about them.

“Opt out of Waymo, or its affiliates, using your personal information (including interior camera data associated with your identity) for training GAI,” the screenshot.

When reached for comment by Gizmodo, Waymo disputed some of the assertions in the policy draft that had leaked but didn't dispute that the leak was real. “This unreleased app page contains placeholder text that doesn't accurately reflect the feature's purpose,” the company said.  “The feature, which is still under development, will not introduce any changes to Waymo's Privacy Policy, but rather will offer riders an opportunity to opt out of data collection for ML training purposes. The data is used among other things, to train models for safety, to make sure cars are clean, find lost items, provide help in case of emergency, check that in-car rules are being followed and improve products and services. Waymo's ML systems are not designed to use this data to identify individual people, and there are no plans to use this data for targeted ads.”

Waymo has become one of the most successful robotaxi companies on the market. With the swift implosion of its core competitor Cruise (which is owned by GM), Waymo has become the dominant player in California's self-driving car industry. Waymo, which is currently operational in a handful of cities across the country, recently partnered with Uber, signaling an expansion of services. Other companies, including Elon Musk's Tesla, have also gestured at future plans to launch robotaxi services—although none have enjoyed Waymo's level of success yet.

A recent study published in Science Translational Medicine involving scientists from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases in collaboration with scientists from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and the University of California-Berkeley have advanced discoveries surrounding the viral glycoprotein GP38 expressed by the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV).

CCHFV is endemic to Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia, and considered a priority pathogen by the World Health Organization. The virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals with a case fatality rate of up to 40%. There are currently no approved vaccines against the virus.

Historically GP38 has been considered an important target for vaccines or other treatments. However, the lack of knowledge regarding GP38s function during infection has hindered efforts to develop CCHFV-specific medical countermeasures.

The new research sheds light on GP38's role in viral infections and pathogenesis, and how GP38-specific antibodies particularly mediate protection in vivo.

This study is focused on demonstrating that GP38 alone can act as a 'viral toxin' and trigger vascular leakage to occur. It is also focused largely on understanding the mechanism of protective efficacy for antibodies targeting GP38."

Andrew Herbert, senior author of the study and USAMRIID branch chief

Evidence also shows that GP38 has a direct role in viral pathogenesis that is independent of its function in viral glycoprotein biogenesis. It emphasizes the importance of including GP38 in CCHFV vaccine design and provides a starting point for the rational design of GP38-targeting anti-CCHF therapeutics.

Additional research backs this evidence by treating CCHFV-challenged mice with exogenous GP38, further enhancing vascular leak in the context of infection, suggesting that GP38 functions as a secreted viral toxin in the induction of vascular leak.

In previous work, published in July 2024 Monticelli and Herbert, along with collaborators from academia and industry, isolated a large panel of GP38-targeting mAbs from human survivors of natural infection, and showed some of these to be protective in animal models of infection against multiple diverse isolates of CCHFV. While this study provided some evidence of protective epitopes on GP38, it did not provide a clear understanding of the mechanism of protection of these anti-GP38 antibodies.

"From the previous study, we didn't know how the antibodies were mediating protection," says Stephanie Monticelli, co-first author of the publication and a research scientist at USAMRIID. "By determining a mechanism of action for protective GP38-specific monoclonal antibody therapies, we can better understand how to target this protein for the development of potent medical countermeasures."

This recent publication showed that non-neutralizing GP38-specific mAbs targeting the N-terminal region of GP38 (region 2) were the most protective against lethal challenge, the most potent at reducing circulating GP38, diminishing vascular leak, and curtailing viral dissemination to distal tissues. The moderate effect of the virus-neutralizing anti-Gc mAb indicates that the observed reduction in vascular leak upon treatment with GP38-binding mAbs is not only a result of overall reduction in viral load but rather is specific to a reduction in circulating GP38 and direct blockade of the function of GP38 in inducing vascular leak.

These discoveries show a clear significance of the virus-host relationship, specifically when working with the CCHFV-challenged subjects.

"Virus host interactions are very complex and teasing apart complex processes that occur during a viral infection can be tricky," says Herbert. "Viral proteins often perform more than one function during infection, and they can also 'collaborate' with other viral proteins, or even host proteins, to perform a specific function that is beneficial for the virus."

This study is part of the Prepositioning Optimized Strategies for Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics Against Diverse Emerging Infectious Threats - PROVIDENT consortium.

New research from the University of Sydney reveals that the number of Australians living with diabetes may be up to 35 percent higher than previously estimated.

The findings raise critical questions about the size of one of Australia's most serious chronic health conditions.

The study, published in Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice, applied a sophisticated algorithm to integrated health data from Medicare, hospital records, and pharmaceutical claims. The results suggest there could be more than two million Australians living with diabetes, many of whom are currently missing from the official diabetes register.

Lead author Emma Cox, PhD Candidate from the Leeder Centre for Health Policy, Economics and Data, said the research highlights a much larger and more diverse population living with diabetes, particularly older Australians, people in remote areas, and culturally and linguistically diverse communities.

“This isn't just a data issue, it's a public health issue,” Ms Cox said. “A significant number of Australians are missing from national statistics. That makes it harder to plan services, allocate funding, and deliver prevention strategies where they're most needed.”

The research was partially funded in 2017 by a Diabetes Australia Research Trust grant and builds on longstanding calls for better integration of medical data to understand the true burden of chronic disease.

Professor Grant Brinkworth, Director of Research at Diabetes Australia, said the findings offer a compelling call to action.

This study tells us what many of us in the sector have said for years: we're not seeing the full picture of diabetes in Australia,”

Professor Grant Brinkworth, Director of Research, Diabetes Australia

“Understanding the true scale is essential if we want to improve outcomes for individuals and manage the national impact of this condition.”

The study also found that many people who are living with diabetes are managing the condition through lifestyle changes or medications like metformin, groups who may be less likely to register with the National Diabetes Services Scheme (NDSS).

“If people aren't visible in the data, they're also invisible to policy and funding decisions,” Professor Brinkworth added.

The research reinforces the importance of improved screening, earlier diagnosis, and greater health system integration to ensure every person affected by diabetes is counted, supported, and resourced.

Diabetes Australia is committed to working with the Australian Government and health sector to ensure barriers to registration are removed with appropriate investment in the NDSS to enable timely registration and accurate reporting.

Innovation Follows $1 Million FARE Award.

Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, a global leader in laboratory automation and innovation, introduces the Next-Generation Basophil Activation Test (BAT) for research use only to more effectively characterize food allergies without exposure to potentially harmful allergens.

Approximately 220 million people globally suffer from at least one food allergy. Most food allergies and treatment efficacies are currently determined through a dated and rigorous Oral Food Challenge (OFC), exposing a patient to gradual amounts of foods to determine if they have a reaction, which could include anaphylaxis in some situations. The new BAT test eliminates that risk, testing for multiple allergens at once through a blood draw -- saving hours of food testing and exposure to potentially harmful reactions.

This offers a groundbreaking alternative in allergy testing, removing patient obstacles and reducing ethical concerns associated with direct allergen exposure in vulnerable participants,”

Jean-Marc Busnel, PhD, Principal Investigator and Senior Staff Research Scientist, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences

“For too long these concerns have limited critical advancements, putting people at risk of not having access to life-saving treatment options should an allergic reaction occur. By removing these barriers, this test unlocks an opportunity to finally expand food allergy drug development and research. This reinforces our mission at Beckman Coulter Life Sciences to deliver tools that empower clinicians and improve patient outcomes.”

The innovation follows the FARE (Food Allergy Research and Education) Innovation Award Diagnostic Challenge which Beckman Coulter Life Sciences received in 2022. The $1 million award helps foster the development of improved testing methods in the field of food allergies.

“At FARE, we have prioritized supporting the development of safer alternatives to oral food challenges that can expose patients to risk and induce anxiety,” said Sung Poblete, PhD, RN, CEO of FARE. “The introduction of this next-generation Basophil Activation Test marks a significant advancement, moving diagnostic innovation from the bench toward future clinical application, paving the way for safer, more accessible food allergy research while offering the opportunity to stimulate progress and we are excited about the promise it holds for research and development.”

BAT are functional assays measuring basophil activation in response to specific allergens or other stimuli.

By leveraging dry technology to overcome traditional BAT challenges, standardization is enabled with conjugated antibodies and allergens pre-mixed and dried down together in a single tube with only 4 pipetting steps. Negative and positive controls can also be included, all without the need for compensation or centrifugation, and is compatible with any flow cytometer.

While BAT has been around for more than 30 years and provides valuable insights in the study of allergies, its adoption has been limited due to the perceived complexity and lack of reproducibility associated with the assay. The use of dry reagents can support overcoming those challenges.

The test offers unmatched flexibility with customizable dried down allergens, antibodies, and concentrations available through Custom Design Service from Beckman Coulter Life Sciences.

A new study by the University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Finland, found that a significant proportion of Parkinson's disease diagnoses are later corrected. Up to one in six diagnoses changed after ten years of follow-up, and the majority of new diagnoses were made within two years of the original diagnosis.

A recent study published in Neurology reveals significant diagnostic instability in Parkinson's disease, with 13.3% of diagnoses revised over a 10-year follow-up period. When dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is treated as a separate diagnostic category, the revision rate increases to 17.7%.

The large-scale study followed over 1,600 patients initially diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. The results demonstrate the ongoing difficulty of distinguishing it from other similar disorders, despite improvements in diagnostics.

Notably, a majority of these diagnostic changes occur within the first two years of diagnosis, which emphasises the challenges and uncertainty clinicians face in diagnosing Parkinson's disease accurately."

Valtteri Kaasinen, Professor of Neurology, University of Turku and principal investigator of the study

Commonly revised diagnoses included vascular parkinsonism, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, and clinically undetermined parkinsonism.

While dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging was frequently used to aid in diagnosis, the study found that postmortem neuropathological examinations were only conducted in 3% of deceased patients, with 64% of these confirming the initial Parkinson's disease diagnoses. This decline in postmortem examinations mirrors a global trend seen in other studies.

The study also highlights the difficulty in differentiating between Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, particularly in relation to the controversial "one-year rule."

"This rule, which considers the temporal sequence of motor and cognitive symptoms, resulted in more latter cases identified compared to the original clinical diagnoses. While the one-year rule is used in clinical practice, its relevance may be limited by the overlap between these disorders, with substantial group-level differences but minimal distinctions at the individual level," says Kaasinen.

"The key conclusions of our study are the urgent need for ongoing refinement of diagnostic processes, enhanced clinical training for neurologists, more frequent use of postmortem diagnostic confirmation, and the development of widely accessible, cost-effective biomarkers," Kaasinen summarises.

Increasing the rate of autopsies would enhance clinicians' understanding of diagnostic accuracy, particularly in cases where initial diagnoses are unclear or revised. The development of cost-effective and accessible biomarkers could improve diagnostic precision, particularly in non-specialised settings, ultimately leading to better patient care.

This retrospective study was conducted at Turku University Hospital and three regional hospitals in Finland, analysing patient records from 2006 to 2020. The study aimed to evaluate the long-term diagnostic stability of Parkinson's disease and assess the accuracy of initial diagnoses over time in a large cohort of patients diagnosed by neurologists, with or without specialisation in movement disorders.

Poor dietary habits in adolescence – lots of sweets, sugary drinks or skipping breakfast – is directly linked to overusing social media, University of Queensland research has found.

Associate Professor Asaduzzaman Khan from UQ's School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences led a team that analyzed data from the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children survey involving 222,865 adolescents from 41 countries.

This is the first multi-national study to offer insights into how social media behaviours are linked to adolescents' dietary choices.

As social media use continues to rise, it's important to access what potential harm its use may be doing to our kids.''

Dr. Asaduzzaman Khan, Associate Professor, UQ's School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences 

The study examined social media use that was defined as excessive (frequent or extended use), or problematic (mirroring addiction-like symptoms with compulsive and uncontrollable behaviour).

Both types were associated with lower breakfast intake and higher consumption of sweets and sugary foods and drinks.

Dr. Khan said the findings reinforced the importance of reducing problematic and excessive social media use to help stop poor dietary habits.

"These poor dietary habits are potential risk factors for obesity, weakened immune system, mental well-being, and chronic conditions including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular issues later in life," he said.

"Issues like cyberbullying, body shaming and negative body image are beyond the scope of this particular work, but we know from other research that overuse of social media certainly affects psychosocial health, academic performance, interpersonal and family relationships.

"The challenge is how, as a family, as a community, we are going to deal with it, so we are using the technology without letting our kids harm themselves.

"We cannot simply live our life without social media or without screens but there is a need for education in the community.''

The research also analyzed fruit and vegetable consumption, finding problematic social media use was associated with a lower fruit and vegetable intake, with adolescents in this category possibly engaging in mindless eating of unhealthy snacks while scrolling, with limited time for meal preparation.

Conversely, excessive use was linked to a higher intake of fruit and vegetables that may be due to the influence of health-conscious influencers, nutritionists, and fitness enthusiasts, the study reported.

Dr Khan said adolescence offered a unique opportunity to develop and promote healthy dietary habits.

"This is a period characterised by autonomy in eating behaviours and establishment of new personal habits,'' he said.

The research is published in Pediatric Research.

New Australian technology is set to transform the way that gastrointestinal cancers are detected and treated with precise, minimally invasive surgery.

Backed by the Federal Government's Economic Accelerator (AEA) Ignite Grant, researchers from the University of South Australia (UniSA) are using quantum technology to develop a first-of-its-kind laparoscopic probe that will allow surgeons to accurately map the spread of tumours.

The technology has the potential to improve cancer survival rates and patient quality of life worldwide.

Led by Dr. Nicole Dmochowska from UniSA's Future Industries Institute, the $405,050 project is being undertaken in partnership with precision cancer surgery company Ferronova.

The probe will work alongside Ferronova's iron-oxide nanoparticle formulation (FerroTrace) to improve the detection of cancerous lymph nodes during surgery, reducing the need for extensive procedures that often lead to life-threatening complications and life-long side-effects for survivors.

Gastrointestinal cancers are among the deadliest, often spreading through the lymphatic system to distant lymph nodes before diagnosis. Traditional surgical methods involve removing large sections of tissue, increasing the risk of infections and long-term digestive issues.

By integrating state-of-the-art quantum sensors into a minimally invasive laparoscopic probe, we aim to give surgeons a powerful new tool to precisely locate affected lymph nodes.

This will potentially enable more targeted surgery, reducing the need for extensive tissue removal and improving post-surgical recovery."

Dr. Nicole Dmochowska from UniSA's Future Industries Institute

The UniSA research team has already demonstrated the feasibility of the quantum sensor-based magnetometer probes in a successful phase-1 clinical trial for oral cancer.

This new project will take this technology further by miniaturising the probe for use in laparoscopic – or keyhole – surgery, allowing for more precise and less invasive cancer treatments.

Researchers have spent more than eight years developing the magnetometer probes for cancer surgery. The AEA Ignite grant will fund the next crucial step: developing a fully functional, preclinically validated prototype that can be trialled in large animal models before progressing to human clinical trials.

"This research aligns with Australia's national priority areas in both medical science and quantum technology," according to UniSA researcher Professor Benjamin Thierry.

"The commercial potential is immense, with an anticipated global market exceeding $2 billion annually," Prof Thierry says.

Unlike existing lymphatic mapping techniques that rely on radioactive tracers, the quantum probe and FerroTrace combination provide a safer and more effective combination, according to Ferronova senior researcher and development engineer Dr. Aidan Cousins.

"This technology is particularly promising for patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy before surgery, where conventional lymphatic mapping methods have limited effectiveness," Dr Cousins says.

"This could be a paradigm shift in cancer treatment, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients worldwide."

Preclinical trials are expected to start within the next year.

Drug-resistant infections - especially from deadly bacteria like tuberculosis and staph - are a growing global health crisis. These infections are harder to treat, often require more expensive or toxic medications and are responsible for longer hospital stays and higher mortality rates. In 2021 alone, 450,000 people developed multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, with treatment success rates dropping to just 57%, according to the World Health Organization.

Now, Tulane University scientists have developed a new artificial intelligence-based method that more accurately detects genetic markers of antibiotic resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus - potentially leading to faster and more effective treatments.

A Tulane study, published in Nature Communications, introduces a new Group Association Model (GAM) that uses machine learning to identify genetic mutations tied to drug resistance. Unlike traditional tools, which can mistakenly link unrelated mutations to resistance, GAM doesn't rely on prior knowledge of resistance mechanisms, making it more flexible and able to find previously unknown genetic changes.

Current methods of detecting resistance used by organizations such as the WHO either take too long - like culture-based testing - or miss rare mutations, as with some DNA-based tests. Tulane's model addresses both problems by analyzing whole genome sequences and comparing groups of bacterial strains with different resistance patterns to find genetic changes that reliably indicate resistance to specific drugs.

Think of it as using the bacteria's entire genetic fingerprint to uncover what makes it immune to certain antibiotics. We're essentially teaching a computer to recognize resistance patterns without needing us to point them out first."

Tony Hu, PhD, Senior Author, Weatherhead Presidential Chair in Biotechnology Innovation and director of the Tulane Center for Cellular & Molecular Diagnostics

In the study, the researchers applied GAM to over 7,000 strains of Mtb and nearly 4,000 strains of S. aureus, identifying key mutations linked to resistance. They found that GAM not only matched or exceeded the accuracy of the WHO's resistance database but also drastically reduced false positives, wrongly identified markers of resistance which can lead to inappropriate treatment.

"Current genetic tests might wrongly classify bacteria as resistant, affecting patient care," said lead author Julian Saliba, a graduate student in the Tulane University Center for Cellular and Molecular Diagnostics. "Our method provides a clearer picture of which mutations actually cause resistance, reducing misdiagnoses and unnecessary changes to treatment."

When combined with machine learning, the ability to predict resistance with limited or incomplete data improved. In validation studies using clinical samples from China, the machine-learning enhanced model outperformed WHO-based methods in predicting resistance to key front-line antibiotics.

This is significant because catching resistance early can help doctors tailor the right treatment regimen before the infection spreads or worsens.

The model's ability to detect resistance without needing expert-defined rules also means it could potentially be applied to other bacteria or even in agriculture, where antibiotic resistance is also a concern in crops.

"It's vital that we stay ahead of ever-evolving drug-resistant infections," Saliba said. "This tool can help us do that."

The cells with electrophysiological activity obtained at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) are opening up new avenues for the study of neurodegenerative diseases and the development of future autologous transplants.

A UPV/EHU study published in the prestigious journal Stem Cell Research & Therapy has proven that stem cells extracted from human dental pulp can be transformed into excitable neuronal cells and has highlighted the potential of these easily accessible cells for nerve tissue engineering. This finding will enable the furthering of advances in cell therapy for treating various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's disease and epilepsy.

"An adult neuron cannot be divided. When you lose it, you lose it for ever. And unlike other organs, the brain has a comparatively low capacity for natural regeneration due to its low presence of stem cells," said Gaskon Ibarretxe, a researcher in the UPV/EHU's Signaling Lab research group. The scientific community is looking for a way to obtain functional neurons that can be transplanted to restore impairments in neurodegenerative pathologies, brain lesions, strokes, etc. "But if the cells transplanted into the brain are to be able to integrate into a damaged brain circuit and replace the lost neurons, they need to be able to produce electrical impulses," added the researcher José Ramón Pineda, co-author of the study and a researcher in the group.

Stem cells have the capacity to divide and differentiate into different types of specialised cells. The UPV/EHU research group has obtained cells very similar to neurons; they "manage to produce electrical impulses like those of neurons by means of the differentiation of stem cells in human dental pulp, the soft tissue located inside the tooth," they said. The main milestone of this study was "the obtaining of cells that display functional excitability and which synthesise a type of neurotransmitter that regulates neuronal activity, without having been genetically modified; the primary dental cells were simply cultured with differentiation factors and were subjected to precise stimuli to generate cells with neuronal electrophysiological activity", said the researchers of the Signaling Lab at the UPV/EHU. This had never been achieved before."

Neurotransmitters are substances released by neurons that can send excitatory or inhibitory signals to make neurons generate an electrical impulse or not. "The cells that we managed to differentiate are capable of synthesising a neurotransmitter known as GABA," explained the researchers. "It is a type of inhibitory signalling, in other words, it controls whether the neuron that receives it fires electrical impulses or not. And that is very important because there are neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease or conditions such as epilepsy in which there is a selective death of those types of cells in specific areas of the brain, and a resulting hyper-excitability of the brain circuitry".

Ibarretxe and Pineda, lecturers in the UPV/EHU's Department of Cell Biology and Histology, expressed great optimism when referring to the new avenues that can be explored on the basis of this finding: "We believe that these cells could be integrated into a damaged brain circuit and replace lost neurons, and thus reconnect with existing neurons and eventually regenerate the entire lost area functionally. This finding suggests a different approach to traditional cell therapy applied to the nervous system, which until now has been based, above all, on reducing inflammation, on neuroprotecting what remained alive, but not on replacing what has been lost. This opens a new door to the future of personalised medicine."

That is in fact the next step in this research: "to transplant these cells into living animals and see if they are integrated into the brain circuit and reconnect with the host's neurons. We obtained cells that generate electrical impulses characteristic of neurons that are not yet fully mature, but we are aware that they must generate trains of electrical impulses and be correctly integrated into a neuronal circuit. We haven't achieved that yet". The UPV/EHU researchers admitted that "there is a long road ahead, but we know it's going to be very promising. We believe that these cells have a great chance of being implemented in the clinical setting. The fact that they are transplanted at a relatively immature stage could even encourage their plasticity and integration into already developed brain circuits". The researchers added that these cells in fact offer an inherent advantage: "They are cells that do not have a tendency to generate tumours; on the contrary, it has been proven that they are very stable cells and differentiate better than other types of human stem cells into neurons," they concluded.

About 65% of melanoma patients do not respond to immunotherapy. New work by the team of Prof. Max Mazzone (VIB-KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology) discovered that an enzyme called HPGDS (expressed in a specific subset of macrophages), plays a key role in immunotherapy resistance. Blocking HPGDS may be a new way to overcome immunotherapy resistance in melanoma patients and potentially in other tumors facing similar challenges. The results of this study were published in Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.

The field of cancer immunotherapy has witnessed exciting therapeutic advances in the last decade, particularly in the treatment of melanoma, a highly aggressive form of skin cancer. However, approximately 65% of melanoma patients still do not respond to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. The immunosuppression induced by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) may be pivotal in this process. TAMs have been shown to impede immune system function, thereby fostering tumor growth and metastasis dissemination. Thus, reprogramming TAM phenotype away from their immunosuppressive state might boost cancer treatments. 

New work by the team of Prof. Max Mazzone (VIB-KU Leuven) and colleagues zooms in on a specific enzyme known as hematopoietic prostaglandin D2 synthase (HPGDS), which is produced by TAMs. HPGDS promotes the formation of a metabolite called prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), which, in turn, helps cancer cells to resist treatment by blocking the activity of T-cells, which are vital for attacking tumors.

By analyzing the expression of genes related to the immune response in patients who responded to immune checkpoint blockade therapies compared to those who did not, we found that HPGDS levels were high in non-responding patients during treatment, whereas were downregulated if the treatment was working and T-cells were then activated against the tumor."

Dr. Rosa Trotta, first author of the study 

By employing genetic deletion of HPGDS in macrophages and using pharmacological inhibitors in mouse and humanized models, the researchers proved a remarkable shift in the macrophages' behavior from promoting tumor growth to supporting a more robust and anti-tumoral immune response. 

"Targeting HPGDS not only enhanced the recruitment and activation of T-cells per se," says Prof. Max Mazzone, "but also showed promise in overcoming resistance to existing therapies. Our findings suggest that blocking HPGDS or the two downstream receptors may be a new potential strategy for improving treatment options for melanoma patients and perhaps others facing similar challenges."

This study suggests that HPGDS inhibitors or PGD2 receptor blockers could serve as new therapeutic agents, either alone or in combination with existing treatments for melanoma and other cancers (i.e., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma) that show similar resistance mechanisms. As the research progresses, the team emphasizes the need for further studies to validate these findings in clinical settings.

A study published in Brain Communications highlights a new approach to treating drug-resistant epilepsy. Researchers at Mayo Clinic have developed an innovative deep brain stimulation (DBS) platform that was used to not only reduce seizures, but also improve memory and sleep - two common challenges for patients with epilepsy.

Epilepsy, a seizure disorder that affects about 50 million people worldwide, often disrupts memory, emotions and sleep. Many cases are drug-resistant, leaving people with limited treatment options. Researchers at Mayo Clinic found that low-frequency DBS not only reduced seizures, but it also improved memory and sleep.

"Using an implanted investigational device, the team continuously monitored brain activity with AI-driven seizure and sleep tracking," says Gregory Worrell, M.D., Ph.D., Mayo Clinic neurologist and co-lead author of the study. "A cloud-based platform simultaneously assessed participants' behavior, memory and mood at home. This real-time data enables precise tuning of stimulation settings, maximizing benefits while minimizing side effects."

By using an implanted device that continuously monitors brain activity, we can detect seizures more accurately than patient-reported diaries in order to optimize deep brain stimulation in real-time and improve treatment."

Vaclav Kremen, Ph.D., Mayo Clinic researcher and co-lead author of the study

The researchers monitored five patients with temporal lobe epilepsy throughout their DBS treatment. The system allowed patients to track their brain activity and symptoms remotely, providing doctors with detailed, real-world data to fine-tune treatments. This technology could lead to more effective treatments for drug-resistant epilepsy and could be expanded to treat other neurological and psychiatric disorders.

"Our study demonstrates the potential of emerging neurotechnology to treat human disease," says Jamie Van Gompel, M.D., Mayo Clinic neurosurgeon and co-author of the study.

"Combining neuroscience, engineering and artificial intelligence, our work is paving the way for more personalized and effective treatments for epilepsy and other brain disorders," says Dr. Worrell.

The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health - National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and the CLARA project, which has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation program. The implanted devices were donated by Medtronic as part of the National Institutes of Health Brain Initiative Public-Private Partnership.

When are you most forthcoming with life updates? And when are you the most transparent about exactly what those updates are? For most folks - show of hands, please - it's when things are going well. Sharing our wins is in our nature; our losses, typically, not so much.

Not surprisingly, governments are similarly inclined. Yet, it turns out, broad government transparency not only breeds goodwill, begetting still more transparency - it can change lives for the better.

Researchers Sarah Anderson and Mark Buntaine, of UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, and colleagues conducted a field experiment with cities in China to demonstrate that an increase in transparency causes decreases in pollution, with meaningful effects on health. Their findings are published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

This has major policy implications because we now know that policies to induce transparency can be effective at improving governance of outcomes like pollution."

Sarah Anderson, professor of environmental politics, UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management

More broadly, the results suggest that transparency can significantly improve how environmental policies are enforced, added Buntaine, professor of environmental institutions and government, and a lead author of the paper. "If governments provide clear and accessible information about their activities, firms respond by reducing pollution, leading to better environmental outcomes, he said. "This has implications for many countries facing similar issues, such as India, Indonesia, and the U.S., where transparency could help bridge gaps between environmental laws and actual practices, improving health and environmental quality broadly."

The researchers sought to understand whether transparency itself causes better enforcement of pollution laws and cleaner air. But governments being governments, studying transparency therein can be challenging: "Those that are more transparent usually have characteristics that help them perform better overall," Buntaine said. "They might be under pressure to be both transparent and effective at the same time, making it difficult to separate the effects of transparency alone from these other pressures. Our goal was to overcome this challenge and see if an increase in transparency, independent of these other factors, directly improves environmental outcomes."

To get at their answer, the team conducted a randomized experiment involving 50 Chinese cities. Half of them were publicly rated on how transparently they shared environmental information, like air quality data and pollution inspections; the other half were not rated. The researchers first showed that the rating boosted transparency in the treated cities. Then, by tracking pollution violations by firms, government inspection activities and air quality in both groups over several years, they were able to isolate the direct effects of transparency on pollution outcomes without other influencing factors - because transparency was randomly boosted.

The results? 

High-polluting companies reduced their violations by 37%, regulatory inspections increased by 90% and overall air pollution dropped by around 8–10% in cities subject to treatment that boosted transparency. All that, and no evidence of direct public pressure, like increased citizen complaints or media coverage, was found. What they did find - and were surprised by - was just how strongly firms responded to increased transparency, suggesting that the implied threat of scrutiny is a major motivator. 

"This provides strong evidence that transparency is a powerful tool for better governance and can lead to meaningful improvements in public health and environmental protection globally," Buntaine said. "These changes saved thousands of lives. 

"Transparency isn't just beneficial in theory - it has real-world impacts that save lives. This study highlights the importance of holding governments accountable through transparency, suggesting that more policymakers should embrace openness as a practical step toward achieving meaningful environmental improvements."

SPECIAL TO CITY & STATE


By Chris Teale

In a little over 400 days, the world's largest sporting event – the FIFA World Cup – will descend on the United States, and while cities are bracing for impact, they hope it will leave a positive legacy.

Eleven U.S. cities, including Philadelphia, will host dozens of games in 2026, in addition to several cities in Canada and Mexico, and they are preparing for thousands of fans to descend not just for the matches but for the Fan Festivals and other events that go along with the tournament.

It presents several logistical headaches for cities in areas like public safety and transportation, as they navigate a six-week, 48-team tournament – the biggest in World Cup history. But the tournament, visiting these shores for the first time since 1994, also poses longer-term questions about what its legacy will look like after the final is played at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on July 19.

Several city leaders promised to be ready at the Smart City Expo USA conference in New York City last week.

Meg Kane, host city executive and CEO of the Philadelphia Soccer 2026 organizing committee, said it all makes for a “really intriguing time,” especially as the city will host other events, including March Madness, the MLB All-Star Game and United States Semiquincentennial celebrations.

“It's a very full year for the city of Philadelphia, as well as the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,” she said.

“It's going to be quite epic, but in a positive way,” said Chris Canetti, president of the Houston 2026 Host Committee, noting that glut of matches and fans means the city will essentially be hosting “Seven Super Bowls in 20 days.”

Recent major event hosts in the U.S. said it is not possible to plan too much. New Orleans, for example, hosted the most recent Super Bowl and then weeks later held its annual Mardi Gras celebrations, all while still recovering from a terrorist attack.

“It really is about preparing for every scenario that could come about, and understanding what our priorities would be in that very scenario and what would be most essential to supporting our residents, to the success of that event, and then keeping everyone in our in our community safe,” New Orleans Chief Information Officer Kimberly LaGrue said during a separate panel discussion.

Engaging with residents early will also help major events go smoothly, especially as their lives will be disrupted in a big way. The recent Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris offer some insight, as residents were invited to get involved in any way they could, whether that be through volunteering, employment or special participatory events like the Marathon for All. Spectators could also watch various road races for free, while schools held an Olympic Week to get young people interested.

“The idea here was to engage,” Étienne Thobois, director general of the Paris Organizing Committee for the Olympics and Paralympics. “If you wanted to be a part of these Games, you could, even remotely.”

Technology will also play a role. Thobois said Paris and private sector partners laid 384,000 kilometers of fiber that is now available for future use, while the city also created a digital twin of all its facilities and streets to help plan for security, camera placement and various other scenarios.

Alex Lasry, CEO of the FIFA World Cup 26 New York New Jersey organizing committee, said the impending tournament has brought an “urgency” to infrastructure improvements. And those that already have a long heritage of embracing new technologies are looking to maintain that stature.

“There is an expectation when you come into the Bay that you will see the future,” said Zaileen Janmohamed, CEO of the San Francisco Bay Area Host Committee. “We are leaning into that.”

One of the most complex pieces of hosting a major tournament is its legacy. Some World Cups and Olympic Games have been criticized previously for not doing enough to map out the future of host cities – something that current host city leaders are keeping top of mind.

Kane said Philadelphia's Lemon Hill Park will host Fan Festivals during the tournament, with around 25,000 people expected to flock there. That 104-acre park has been “underinvested in” despite its crucial location near 13 neighborhoods, she said, but upgrades for the World Cup should help make it better for future users.

“The goal is that after the World Cup and after the FIFA Fan Festival is brought down, that we will invest further in leaving the park better than what it was previously,” Kane said.

“When people look at the World Cup in the United States, they're going to say this was the biggest and best World Cup that they've ever seen,” Lasry said. “That's the legacy that'll then show that we should get the 2031 Women's World Cup. There are these other sports and entertainment events that will be coming. Maybe it shouldn't be another 30 years before America gets the World Cup again, maybe it shouldn't be another 30 years before we get the Summer Olympics or events like that.”

New Chelsea signing Kendry Paez is currently training with Strasbourg. The 17-year-old Ecuador international will head to Stamford Bridge from Independiente del Valle this summer, after he turns 18, for a total package of €20m.

Paez is currently undertaking an acclimatisation process. He has already made two visits to Cobham, including an extended period in February, and is now gaining experience at the Blues' sister club, with the chance to meet Liam Rosenior and work with the first-team squad.

At this stage, the plan is for Paez to be part of the Club World Cup squad selected by Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca. It has not been decided yet whether a loan to Strasbourg is on the cards.

The Blues intend to recall Djordje Petrovic and Andrey Santos, while the plan is for Mathis Amougou to spend 2025/26 with Strasbourg. However, should the west Londoners and Strasbourg both end up in the same European competition, BlueCo 22 would put the latter in a blind trust, allowing both to still compete, and the knock-on effect would be an inability to loan any players between clubs.

 Chelsea are in for a busy summer and are expected to be particularly active in the June 1-10 window as they bid to add names ahead of the Club World Cup and get business done early. Midfielder Dario Essugo will join from Sporting in time for the tournament in a deal worth €22m.

The Blues are in the market for a right-footed left-winger and a new No.9. Winger targets are still being crystalised, but Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams and Borussia Dortmund's Jamie Gittens are both still appreciated. Mathys Tel could become a target again if Tottenham Hotspur don't take the option to buy him from Bayern Munich.

Chelsea's search for another winger is more with Mykhailo Mudryk's situation in mind than that of Jadon Sancho. Mudryk is currently serving a provisional ban after testing positive for the banned substance meldonium. Although the capital club are fully supporting him, Mudryk could face a four-year ban, or a lengthy process defending himself regardless of the outcome.

GIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Mykhailo Mudryk has been limited to just 158 minutes of Premier League action this season

Maresca and influential figures behind the scenes will also decide at the end of the season whether to return Jadon Sancho to Manchester United for a £5m 'penalty' fee rather than proceed with an obligation to buy of up to £25m, which kicks in if Chelsea finish above 15th. This is already almost mathematically guaranteed.

Chelsea have Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap high in their thinking and will face competition from Manchester United and possibly Newcastle United as well. Delap is likely to be available for around £40m this summer since he has a relegation release clause set at this number. It is not thought Manchester City plan to trigger a buyback clause also set at this figure.

The Blues will also consider RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko and Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres, two names featuring on Arsenal's list. Chelsea will likely enter the race for Newcastle's in-form striker Alexander Isak, but only if he genuinely becomes available.

 Victor Osimhen, who is currently on loan at Galatasaray from Napoli, is currently less of a priority for Chelsea. The Nigerian striker has not changed his £250,000-per-week wage demands, while regardless of the number offered, he would have to agree to the Blues' incentive-driven structure.

Saudi Arabia remains the most likely destination for Osimhen, who is keen on a move to the Saudi Pro League after almost joining Al-Ahli last summer. It is believed Al-Hilal, Al-Ittihad, Al-Qadsiah and NEOM SC have all discussed him, but central dealmakers will ultimately decide the best fit.

Al-Ahli is viewed as an unlikely landing spot now that Ivan Toney has joined from Brentford, with head coach Mathias Jaissle wanting a holding midfielder, left-back and likely a No.10 since Roberto Firmino is set to depart.

Chelsea's 2023/24 accounts reveal fresh FFP talks with UEFA

This summer will also be key for Chelsea as they look to resolve ongoing issues with both the Premier League and UEFA. The Champions League qualification-chasers are in talks with the former over self-declared financial breaches under former owner Roman Abramovich, with a settlement the most likely outcome.

Chelsea already agreed a similar €10m settlement with UEFA over the same matter. Owners Clearlake-Boehly set aside £100m from the original £2.5bn sale price to deal with these inherited issues.

The Blues are also in fresh talks with UEFA over their current Financial Fair Play position. Although Chelsea Holding's 2023/24 accounts show a post-tax profit of £129.6m, this was only after selling their women's team to parent company BlueCo 22 for a profit of £200m. The Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules allow for this profit to form part of calculations, but UEFA rules do not.

Talks with UEFA are described as productive and amicable by sources, with another settlement the expected outcome. UEFA has the power to impose a European ban, but this is usually a punishment reserved for repeat offenders, or clubs who do not cooperate. Clearlake-Boehly gained stock with UEFA by immediately flagging breaches pre-dating them and there is optimism the current issue can be resolved. UEFA are expected to rule on the issue by the end of May.

The use of the cameras will be on a trial basis after they were approved last month by IFAB, the sport's lawmakers.

"We think that it is a good chance to offer the viewers a new experience, in terms of images taken from a perspective, from an angle of vision which was never offered before," said Pierluigi Collina, chairman of the FIFA referees committee.

"It's a combination of new experience for broadcasters and also for coaching purposes," he added.

"Having the possibility to see what the referee sees is important in the debriefing, to evaluate how the call was made by the referee, which was his view, and so on."

The 32-team competition in the United States will also attempt to crack down on time-wasting by goalkeepers, awarding a corner to the opposing team if they hold on to the ball beyond eight seconds.

The current rule states that 'keepers are supposed to be sanctioned with an indirect free-kick if they hold on for more than six seconds.

However, the offence is rarely penalised.

The Club World Cup begins on June 14 and runs until July 13.

Six neighbourhood associations in the Basque city of San Sebastián have asked Fifa to withdraw it as a venue for the 2030 men's World Cup. The letter – which was criticised by the city's mayor on Tuesday – comes three months after the city was named as one of 11 Spanish venues for the tournament taking place in Spain, Morocco and Portugal.

Signed by associations representing several areas around the San Sebastián's historic centre as well as a platform of residents pushing for “tourism degrowth,” the letter said: “Hosting the Fifa World Cup will only worsen living conditions in our city,” adding that it would “further exacerbate the touristification” of the city.

Between 2015 and 2024, the number of tourists visiting San Sebastián – from within Spain and beyond – climbed by 78%, according to those behind the letter. The effect on the city, long celebrated for its Michelin-star restaurants, scores of pintxo bars and crescent-shaped La Concha beach, has been “brutal,” they said. “Residents are being pushed out of the city, public spaces are being reshaped according to commercial interests, infrastructure is being designed to meet the needs of the tourism industry and the local language and culture are being fetishised for marketing purposes.”

Anger over the issue led hundreds of people to take to the streets in late October, echoing the widespread protests across Spain last year as tourism soared to record levels.

The arrival of the world's largest football tournament would probably exacerbate the situation while benefiting only a “privileged few,” the letter to Fifa said. “The effects of this mega-event on most of the population are dramatic: the worsening of the housing crisis, the increase in tourist activity, the commodification of urban space, the development of unsustainable transport infrastructure and the implementation of security-driven measures that will constrain daily life.”

The associations said their call to Fifa was part of a wider push. “Tourism in our city has already had a major impact on daily life, causing serious harm,” the letter said. “We therefore believe it is urgent to follow the path of tourism degrowth and hosting events like the Fifa World Cup moves us in precisely the opposite direction.”

Fifa did not reply to a request for comment, but the city's mayor was swift to distance himself from the letter. “I honestly don't share that point of view,” said Eneko Goia s, arguing that residents should be proud of the San Sebastián's longstanding success when it comes to organising sporting events. “If it was up to them, the city would have zero international profile.”.

NWSL

LOS ANGELES — Michele Kang is used to people not seeing her vision. She doesn't mind their initial reactions either, the way they might think she has overstepped or gotten it wrong. She tries not to pay much attention, though she doesn't always have a choice.

Sometimes, friends will send her the best posts they've spotted on social media after she has made a move with one of her teams. She takes a spin through fan reactions on rare occasions, but generally, the owner of three women's soccer clubs around the world relies on her staff. She talks to players for their input, too. She has built a thick skin over the years from her time as a CEO and founder in her pre-soccer life.

But Kang focuses mostly on what she is trying to accomplish, which these days is a lot in the women's soccer world.

“If you believe in it, and if you're trying to do something for the first time, it's not necessarily people thinking you're wrong or bad or whatever, but people haven't seen it,” she told The Athletic on Saturday before the U.S. women's national team's 2-0 win over Brazil. “It's only natural that they're skeptical.”

People were doubtful when she took over the Washington Spirit in 2022 after a contentious battle with previous ownership in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), bidding $35 million for a team at a time when most clubs ranged from $3 million to $5 million in expansion fees and valuations.

“I'm not the first one who did this,” Kang said, pointing to various start-up investments across Silicon Valley. “It's not any different. If we think the NWSL is a valuable product and we don't value it, who's going to value it for us?”

The average NWSL team is valued at $104 million, with the Spirit valued at $95 million (fifth overall across the league), per Sportico's rankings as of September 2024.

People were again skeptical when Kang took over Olympique Lyonnais Féminin, finalized in February last year (the purchase was completed last August). She turned the perennial French powerhouse into a standalone club separate from the men's side. “Everyone was like, ‘She's crazy; that shouldn't be allowed. This is against European culture,'” she said. “Now teams are copying because they saw the benefit.”

Chelsea followed suit a few months later, announcing the women's team would be “repositioned” alongside the men's team, with the women getting their own standalone business. However, the sale to a sister company is still being assessed by the Premier League from a fair market value standpoint.

Lyon was the third team Kang added to her ownership portfolio, having acquired the London City Lionesses in England in 2023. That team is leading the FA Women's Championship, 2 points ahead in the race for promotion to the top-tier Women's Super League (WSL). Kang folded all three teams under her Kynisca Sports International, a multi-team global women's soccer organization. It's something that has not been done on the women's side but has been widely criticized among men's clubs.

While widening her sphere of influence beyond professional clubs in the U.S. and Europe, she has found a significant partner in U.S. Soccer.

Last November, Kang became one of the federation's largest donors, with $30 million earmarked over five years for women's youth national team camps, talent identification and scouting, and female coach and referee education and mentorship. Friday, she doubled down with another $25 million investment as U.S. Soccer integrates Kang's Kynisca Innovation Hub into its Soccer Forward Foundation. The sides will work together to perform much-needed research on the health of athletes and establish best practices across the women's soccer landscape for performance and player health.

“Our objective was not just, ‘We'll do some research and publish and say here's a standard,'” Kang told The Athletic on Saturday. She launched the innovation hub alongside the multi-club umbrella organization last year. “I'd really rather make it a living and breathing document and get teams to implement it. When you start thinking about that, there were some limitations as a private foundation and private effort.”

She found out U.S. Soccer had plans of its own along the same lines, and the federation had much greater reach when it came to conducting research and implementing quality across teams.

“This partnership is key in accelerating our in-service to soccer strategy,” U.S. Soccer CEO JT Batson said in the partnership announcement. “Kynisca Innovation Hub and Soccer Forward share a mission to advance women's soccer, and by combining efforts, we're creating an unmatched platform for research, innovation and long-term impact.”

When Kang made her donation to U.S. Soccer last year, she set clear terms with U.S. Soccer. It wasn't created for U.S. Soccer to avoid spending its own money. It would allocate its budget, and her donation would provide the boost.

“Over time, I saw their vision and how they're executing against their vision,” she said.

She shared a lot of the skepticism that was already around the federation, based on its track record with the women's national team, but she saw potential — especially after she started talking with Batson. “They're getting things done,” she said. “Look at the coaches they brought in for both the men and women, the training center, the Soccer Forward Foundation.”

Though she immediately found something of a kindred spirit in Batson — their first meeting at the Paris Olympics was scheduled for 45 minutes, but instead they “geeked out for a few hours” discussing the big-picture needs of the women's game — the addition of USWNT head coach Emma Hayes helped tremendously.

Kang and Hayes spent some time together in London and the United States.

“She's not just a head coach focused on winning; she has a bigger vision. She wants to make an impact, really move the needle,” Kang said. “U.S. Soccer creating the Soccer Forward Foundation, Emma coming in and having that vision, me separately having that vision, we're all coming together. Why wouldn't we work together? This was sort of like love at first sight.”

As exciting as the partnership is for Kang, there's still a lot on her mind.

“For something like women's soccer to move forward, where your vision, my vision and 5,000 other visions come to fruition, there are so many elements that need to move together,” she said.

It's not just building a training center and hiring the right technical staff; it's the referees, it's the youth development, it's coaching education. She's thinking about how the whole landscape becomes sustainable.

And she knows she can't do everything, nor should she. Kang has picked her key areas to keep the whole thing moving. After her donation last November, she has already seen some results: more under-23 camps for the USWNT, and people are talking about referees and women's health.

“It's a very, very critical moment for all of us, and we need to work together to make sure that everything is moving in the same direction and everyone can be successful,” Kang said.

For her, it has never been a zero-sum game. However, she's worried that sometimes the best efforts get undermined without better coordination.

In her eyes, this is actually a good problem, especially when comparing where the NWSL was when she first took over the Spirit to now.

Kang has repeated one line over the past couple of years as she makes waves across the sport: She wants a critical mass, for more people to come in.

“No one can do this by himself or herself,” she said. “If I can bring attention and show how this could work, and more people join in, the tipping point happens. I'd be very grateful if I could see that in my lifetime.” She paused, then laughed before adding, “In my soccer lifetime.”

MLS

Patrick Agyemang has no problem elaborating on his answers to questions about his rapid rise. He's generous when it comes to sharing detail and perspective. Only one of over a dozen queries warrants a one-word answer of “no” – albeit with a bit of a chuckle to provide plenty of subtext.

The question: Did he hear from U.S. Soccer or sense he was being considered for inclusion prior to Mauricio Pochettino's tenure?

It's defensible to an extent. Striker has quickly become one of the deepest position groups in the USMNT pool, with multiple players scoring regularly in Europe – Josh Sargent and Haji Wright were at it again this past weekend – and a steady stable of dependable forwards playing regularly in MLS. Injuries, however, remain a regular concern.

Folarin Balogun has struggled since joining Monaco in the summer of 2023 and hasn't played since October after suffering a shoulder injury. Ricardo Pepi's season ended in late January after suffering a knee injury. Sargent missed all of November and December with a groin injury, and Wright missed nearly four months with an ankle complaint.

Even so, to those who hadn't been watching Agyemang's 2024 season, the 24-year-old's inclusion on Pochettino's January camp squad may have seemed like little more than a flier on a young player.

“It's so easy to go into these camps and think you're not good enough to be here, or just feel like this isn't your level, it's too high for you or something,” Agyemang told The Athletic. “For me, I go into these camps and I'm just like, ‘I need to do my role. I need to work hard. If I get on the field, I need to show that I belong here and I want to be back, to be in this picture.'”

Agyemang was arguably the standout player of his first USMNT camp, scoring in each of his first two international caps in wins against Venezuela and Costa Rica. The strong impression kept him in frame for the Nations League finals, where he came off the bench in the semifinal vs. Panama and then started the third-place match against Canada. His 35th-minute goal in the latter fixture helped the U.S. pull level before halftime.

While the end result — a fourth-place showing in a four-team bracket — hardly inspired, Agyemang's conversations with Pochettino made him feel as though he had impressed again.

“I've been really trying to make a presence for myself on the field,” Agyemang said. “In the first game against Panama, if I could go back, I would change the decisions that I made in a split moment, because essentially, I could have scored two goals, but the fact I was able to create space for myself in those opportunities, (Pochettino) was happy with it. He's realizing I can come in showing a different profile and spark to the game. As long as I continue doing that, he was happy with it.

“There's things I need to still improve on, but in the overall bulk of it, it was a positive outlook on what I did (from him).”

It was hard to find reasons for optimism surrounding the USMNT after those consecutive defeats.

The two games provided a worrying 180 minutes for Pochettino to assess, with defensive miscues and clumsy attempts at upfield progression leaving time for concerningly few glimpses of promise. After each game, pundits and fans alike grasped for answers as to how the U.S., once lauded for grit and determination, could look so flat.

Throughout the discourse, two players' names emerged as bright spots amid the carnage, the same two who combined for the team's only goal of the window: Diego Luna and Agyemang. While Luna's stock began rising during a breakout 2023, Agyemang's has escalated more rapidly, having only just become Charlotte FC's starting striker in 2024.

He has now been thrust into contention for the 2026 World Cup, and even the loudest detractors of the U.S.'s present form can notice what he brings to the fold.

“Yeah, it has been a lot, just how quickly everything has been moving,” Agyemang said. “I've always prayed for this. I've always had the faith that at some point, hopefully I'll be able to be on a stage where I can really show what I can do and just give my all for it, just to see that this is the start of something that potentially could just keep going higher. It's a blessing.”

At a time when former U.S. stars are questioning the motivation and commitment of the current group of players, Agyemang's performances have merited increased attention. While many other U.S. forwards have played abroad, Agyemang's development has fully come stateside, first in the college ranks and then with Charlotte.

A striker can often force his way onto a tournament squad on the back of strong scoring form, and Agyemang is no exception. The fact that making the World Cup squad seems like a genuine possibility is an impressive development from a player whose professional career is still getting started.

“To hear stuff like that, it's a nice feeling,” Agyemang said of his increasing support, “but that just makes me want to do it more.”

Agyemang's ascent is even more impressive when considering that he didn't begin playing striker regularly until he was 21.

Given his pace and dribbling ability, coaches asked Agyemang to play on the wing, most often on the left to cut inwards onto his preferred right foot. It's the spot where Agyemang began his college career with his hometown Eastern Connecticut State Warriors. He was prolific during his two years in Division III, bagging 30 goals and 10 assists in 39 appearances and garnering D-1 interest from the University of Rhode Island. Once he arrived, his new coach saw a different way to maximize his skillset.

“When I got to Rhode Island, that's when the coaches said, ‘I want you to be my No. 9,'” Agyemang said. “I was like, ‘OK, cool. I could do pretty well (in) this position for myself.' I thought if I continue just learning more about the nine position, I could be a really good nine.”

Agyemang took to his new position and level of competition quickly, landing on the Atlantic 10 All-Conference first team in both his junior and senior seasons. He scored 19 times while adding 12 assists in 37 games, and that caused his stock to soar ahead of the 2023 MLS SuperDraft, where Charlotte traded up to select him 12th overall.

While he earned 423 minutes across the regular season and Leagues Cup, scoring twice, most of his rookie development came in MLS Next Pro with Crown Legacy FC. Throughout 2023, however, he found himself being asked to play striker in a less agile manner, a potential byproduct of his 6-foot-4 stature as well as a coach (Christian Lattanzio) whose positional play model had granularly defined job descriptions for each role.

“It's hard,” Agyemang said of being assessed on his stature. “I remember when I first got here, a lot of times, it was just like: hold the ball, set and go. Obviously, that's a lot of principles that as a striker you want, because at the end, you want to score your goals in the box and stuff like that. I think I had to build into it, because I was letting people know, like, I could do more than that.

“I know my game, and I know when I'm at my best. I know what I'm good at. When the ball is on my feet, I'm never scared to, like, take somebody on in a 1-v-1. I look for those opportunities, and I always want to go.”

Ahead of 2024, Charlotte appointed Dean Smith as its new head coach, bringing the former Aston Villa and Norwich City boss over for his first job outside England. Early in preseason, Agyemang worked with his new coaching staff to try incorporating more of his natural skillset into his game.

Agyemang feels as though Smith — like Pochettino with the national team — took the time to size up how he could thrive most.

“There's a difference,” Agyemang said of coaches who tailor game plans to their personnel instead of forcing players into strict systems. “You definitely feel that. Initially, when I first was here at Charlotte, it felt like I was just a role, like they weren't really looking into who I was as a player.

“I think a lot of times, coaches try to give you too much information rather than letting you just play. So I think now, especially with the coaches I've been working with now, it's been a big change. I feel like now, I'm just gonna continue to elevate my game.”

Agyemang and Charlotte leveled up during a transformative 2024. Across 2,014 minutes in the regular season and playoffs, Agyemang led the club with 10 goals and tied for the team lead with six assists. He bagged three crucial game-winners as Charlotte found its rhythm in the spring and summer, showing Smith he could swing results with his approach to leading the line.

“His ceiling is as much as he wants it to be, to be honest,” Smith told the Total Soccer Show podcast in March. While he has just one goal to date in the 2025 MLS season, the underlying numbers show that he has the requisite instinct to find dangerous areas that typifies an elite center forward.

Since the start of 2024, 30 strikers have played at least 1,500 minutes in MLS. It's a sample that includes luminaries like Luis Suárez, Christian Benteke and Cucho Hernández as well as prolific MLS forwards like Jordan Morris and Cristian Arango. While Agyemang's numbers are competitive among them in most categories, he tops the charts in two crucial rate stats for a forward with his profile.

Nobody has a higher progressive carry rate — that is, how often his carries advance the ball at least five yards closer to goal — of 32% (second-best is 22.1%), while no striker has logged a greater share of his touches in the opponent's box than Agyemang's rate of 25.4%.

When presented with the data, Agyemang can't help but take a little pride in how his work is paying off. Still, he sees it as evidence that he needs to keep refining the rest of his game.

“It's cool to hear those stats, but I just know how I like to play the game now,” Agyemang said. “I'm comfortable being on the ball and on the run with the ball. With my frame, you look at me, and you're like, ‘A 6'4” winger, it just doesn't make sense.'

“I like to add those things I've learned on the wing, and bring it into my game, because I want to make my game unique to myself. There's a lot of players in the world that play the nine in a way, but I want to make it my unique way. That's why I think like that progressive ball carrying is a way that I like to do. Maybe nines, you know, they don't want the ball (that far from goal), but I love carrying the ball.”

— U.S. Soccer Men's National Team (@USMNT) January 18, 2025



Another area that Agyemang continues to refine is his off-ball movement, a facet that changes considerably when shifting from the wing to center forward.

He admits to being “very critical” of himself, watching each of his performances back to revisit in-moment thoughts that crop up in games. He looks for “patterns” that come up in game scenarios, trying to identify pockets of space that opponents are presenting his team so he can exploit them to create room for himself or his teammates as a clever decoy.

“I've just been really working on that, because before I really didn't do as much movement,” Agyemang said, “But the best way as a striker is like, you want to feel as if the defenders don't know where to go at times. If I'm always in front of them and stuff like that, it's a field day for them. You kind of mix it up and find ways to open space.”

That effort is possibly more crucial now as Smith calibrates his system to include Wilfried Zaha, who joined the club this winter on an initial loan. The former Crystal Palace great is among the modern era's most prolific dribblers, and his presence will inevitably take some carrying responsibility off of Agyemang's shoulders. While the striker acknowledged that they're “still learning and understanding each other's games,” the initial collaboration has been positive and he's already seen glimpses of the pair “getting that rhythm down.”

Charlotte fans are watching that partnership blossom with great hope, as the team — which also includes U.S. international defender Tim Ream and former Villa and Burnley midfielder Ashley Westwood — projects to remain in contention in the Eastern Conference. It'll also be closely assessed by Pochettino and his staff as they continue to size up the U.S.'s player pool ahead of next summer.

Agyemang's work rate in the Nations League finals stood out in contrast to some of his teammates. His goal against Canada was a just return for his first-half shift, where his movement had unsettled the defense and opened spaces for Luna, Tim Weah and Christian Pulisic.

To him, that inner drive was refined during his time in the NCAA.

“I think there's things that I still need to work on, but I think it's just like the grit and the grind part — like the determination,” Agyemang said of his college tenure. “No matter what happens, I'm gonna keep going. I think that's the part I really like grabbed and has stuck with me since college.”

He, like his peers, will also want to play in the 2026 World Cup. The fierce competition in his position will keep a fire under Agyemang to turn in good performances, refine that interplay with Zaha and keep himself on the radar regardless of what his compatriots are doing.

Agyemang isn't fixating too much on what could happen when the tournament kicks off in over 15 months — after all, he wasn't even a projected starter for his club 15 months ago.

“For me, I try not to look too far, because it brings a lot of extra pressure,” he said. “But at the end of the day, it's home. If you're a part of that, you're involved in something that's so special, just to be able to play in a World Cup on your home soil. That's such a special feeling. I think a lot of Americans will want to be a part of that. It's cool to just be in the conversation for it. At the end of the day, who knows?”

And so, the hard work continues in Charlotte and off the training ground. Agyemang emphasized that he wants to improve his consistency in 2025, and not just in front of goal. He's studying the tape to see how he can improve his defensive pressing, how to be even better at retaining the ball and making better decisions when it's at his feet. In total, it's about “polishing the cleanness of (his) game” now that he's getting consistent reps.

At a time when greats like Landon Donovan question if the current group wants to represent the U.S., it's an honor that's only fueling Agyemang to push on. Although it comes with increased expectations and scrutiny, it's a blessing he's worked hard to invite – and an area where he's more than happy to elaborate.

“Now that I've quickly gotten into this national team, they're expecting more from me,” Agyemang said. “For me, it's cool. It's a fun dynamic to work with. At the end of the day, if you want to be a great player, you need to know what's to come with it.

“I'm blessed to be in this position, but I won't puff my chest because of what's come, if that makes sense. I'm always this type of guy to keep my head down and want to do more, and get better each and every day. I don't want it to just be, like, that was my first and my last camp. I want it to be the beginning of something to come.”

This is Alyssa Thompson's moment.

That much was palpable when she received the ball left of the center circle from defender Crystal Dunn during the U.S. women's national team's 2-0 win over Brazil on Saturday in front of 32,303 people in her home city of Los Angeles.

For anyone who has watched the 20-year-old attacking player during her three seasons across town with Angel City FC in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), her path might as well have been cut into the field at SoFi Stadium with a lawn mower: straight to goal.

One feint sent a Brazilian defender sliding out of the play and Thompson exploited the space left behind. By the time she reached the top of the 18-yard box, the moment had begun to feel like what could one day be considered vintage Thompson, much like the goal she scored for Angel City before the international break. But rather than aim for the goal, Thompson delivered an assist that split two more defenders to reach an oncoming Trinity Rodman, who knocked the ball past Brazilian and Kansas City Current goalkeeper Lorena in the sixth minute.

“That was the perfect ball to a perfect finish. I think we read each other's minds in that moment,” Rodman said after the match.

Her direct attacking style aside, Thompson's short journey from being voted Gatorade Player of the Year at high school level in 2021 to this moment has been anything but linear.

She was the first overall pick in the 2023 NWSL Draft and the youngest player on the USWNT's World Cup roster in a matter of months. Her standout rookie season rolled into her first senior call-up, however, and things quickly changed.

Thompson made just two appearances off the bench in the defending champion United States' ill-fated run to the round of 16 at that World Cup, playing just 17 minutes in a tournament that saw very little squad rotation by coach Vlatko Andonovski. The World Cup crash led to Andonovski resigning and the youngest member of the squad getting left out of the roster to regain form, with mixed results, for her club.



After new coach Emma Hayes took the reins midway through 2024, Thompson watched the USWNT's Olympic gold medal run from home. Instead of a summer in France, she worked to hone her skills, and after five goals and two assists in seven NWSL games, Thompson got the call from Hayes in October. And she didn't waste her shot.

The then-19-year-old scored her first senior international goal 39 minutes into a friendly against Iceland in Austin. The joy was apparent on her face as she leaped into the arms of substitute Sophia Wilson on the sideline.

“I feel like last year, and the last couple of years, I put a lot of pressure on myself,” Thompson told reporters last week. “I think just coming in this year, I just wanted to be confident in my abilities and know what I bring as a player, and not compare myself to other people. I think that has helped me a lot, just knowing that if I'm playing like Alyssa Thompson then I'll be able to put a good foot forward for my team.”

Each month since, Thompson has been finding and learning ways to sharpen her craft. And, with the marquee front three of Wilson, Rodman and Mallory Swanson, who headlined that Olympic triumph, down to just Rodman for now, Thompson found another moment to make her case on Saturday.

Hayes acknowledged Thompson's journey ahead of the match as a cautionary tale of how a mistimed moment can obscure a player's potential, especially from an outsider's perspective.

“I hope that we can look at someone like Alyssa Thompson's situation, i.e. a 17-year-old coming into the program probably underprepared for that because the level is so much higher, to then have a journey which is pretty normal for a young player. But I think she's in the best place she has been in terms of her start to the season,” Hayes said.

But the former Chelsea manager also expressed her intention to continue elevating the characteristics that make Thompson an attacking threat as she progresses through national team camps and racks up minutes on the field.

“Since October we've been working so hard positionally with her to get her to have a better understanding of what to do and when, and saying, ‘Listen, at the top level, you're a great one-v-one specialist, but when you're playing the top players in the world, they know how to drop off of you in a certain way where they don't give you a one-v-one opportunity, so how do you link with others?',” Hayes said.

There were glimpses of those areas of growth in Saturday's match, particularly in some of Thompson's unsuccessful attempts to take on the well-read Brazilian and Olympique Lyonnais central defender Tarciane. Still, she created dangerous scoring opportunities that contributed to the team's 2.72 expected goals (xG) figure.

Hayes has seen the gap close between where Thompson was six months ago and where she is now, and part of that comes through in her instinctive thinking.

“When you play for me, I will overload you to take a player to another level tactically, but that means for a period of time, there's a lot of thinking going on, a lot of processing,” Hayes said. “There's a lot of conscious thinking, whereas I feel like with Alyssa now, she understands that, so she's able to do it more naturally.”

Thompson is still at the beginning of her professional career and it's important to consider: managing internal pressure, brewing confidence and resisting the urge to compare herself to others. These are all tall orders for most teens (and adults) even when they haven't faced the challenges she has. But they, too, have led to the moment Thompson is now enjoying, and she credits her teammates with supporting her through it.

“They believe in me so much and I attribute a lot of my success to them because their help and reassurance has really helped me become the player that I am right now,” Thompson said.

Angel City captain and defender Ali Riley has viewed Thompson's journey from a unique vantage point.

The 37-year-old Los Angeles native attended Harvard-Westlake, the same high school Thompson and her younger sister and Angel City teammate Gisele did, and experienced that same World Cup in 2023, though Riley played for co-host New Zealand (she was born in LA but her father is from New Zealand). Riley was quick to refuse credit for any guidance she's given the elder Thompson and made clear her progress is just as promising as her ceiling — as a player and as a face of the sport.

“Even when we look at how much she's grown, her performances on the field, what's so special about her is that this is the beginning,” Riley told The Athletic. “I think she has the personality and the eloquence to be someone who can speak about being a woman in sport, being a woman of color in sport. She's so good about speaking about her experience growing up, the value of representation.”

Riley, who hasn't played since last season because of nerve damage in her left leg, added that Thompson was voted into the team's leadership group this year.

When Thompson went through a bit of a scoring drought during that 2024 season, Riley said she faced criticism from “keyboard warriors” on social media who picked through her stats and body language with a fine-tooth comb. Now, Riley said, “when she scores, she doesn't seem relieved, she's genuinely happy.”

So far, that happiness has shown up as cheeky TikTok goal celebrations with her sister Gisele and fellow Angel City striker Casey Phair on the sidelines. Other times, it's a full-throated rebel yell.

For Thompson to enjoy another stellar performance in her hometown on Saturday only sweetened the moment — topped off with one of those yells after assisting fellow Southern California native Rodman.

“I love playing in LA,” Thompson said in the mixed zone following the match. “Being here is amazing for the club, and I've never played in LA with the national team, so being able to feel that comfort from my city and my family and friends, I just felt like I could be more like me, and I knew what I could do.”

FIFA estimates its next two summer tournaments – primarily hosted in the United States – will generate $47 billion in economic impact and provide 290,000 jobs in the country, with $62 billion in gross domestic product globally, the soccer governing body said in a news release this week.

FIFA and the World Trade Organization (WTO) Secretariat released two studies to showcase potential socioeconomic impact in the U.S. and globally from this summer's Club World Cup 2025 and next summer's World Cup 2026. 

The Club World Cup could help generate up to $21.1 billion in global GDP, including $9.6 billion in the U.S. 

It could also generate $17.1 billion in gross output and unlock $3.36 billion in social benefits across the U.S., while supporting the creation of approximately 105,000 full time equivalent (FTE) jobs. 

World Cup 2026 could help drive up to $40.9 billion in GDP, with $8.28 billion in social benefits and the creation of nearly 824,000 jobs globally. Specifically for the U.S., OE estimates 185,000 FTE jobs could be created, with $30.5 billion in gross output and $17.2 billion in GDP. 

The analysis also estimates 3.7 million fans will attend Club World Cup matches this summer, while 6.5 million people are expected to attend World Cup matches in 2026. 

FIFA says the studies aim to capture both tangible and intangible benefits through structured and comprehensive analysis that includes direct, indirect and induced contributions. The studies were developed by OpenEconomics (OE), an independent body that supports institutions and companies in designing policies and investment projects. 

The analysis adopts both the Impact Analysis methodology and Social Return on Investment (SROI) methodology aligned with Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines, to evaluate the value generated relative to the investments made. 

To provide a comprehensive picture, the analysis uses an inter-country social accounting matrix (SAM) with a breakdown into 45 productive sectors and 76 different countries. Key data comprised of international benchmarks from organizations such as the World Bank, OECD, ILOSTAT, UNECE, WTO and UNWTO. The same methodology has been applied across both reports.

The 2025 Club World Cup begins with Lionel Messi and Inter Miami on center stage against Egyptian club Al Alhy on June 14 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. The final will be July 13 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Club World Cup matches will also be hosted in Atlanta, Charlotte, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Orlando, Nashville, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington D.C.

The World Cup begins June 11, 2026 and ends with the final at MetLife Stadium July 19, 2026. World Cup games in the U.S. will be played in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Miami, Philadelphia, Seattle and near the Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco areas. World Cup games will also be played in Guadalajara, Mexico City and Monterrey in Mexico, and Toronto and Vancouver in Canada.

Updated on April 08, 2025

In a move that sent ripples through the soccer world, UEFA released its financial report for the previous 2023-24 season, laying bare the intricate details of the organization's earnings, expenditures, and leadership compensation. At the center of attention was one figure: Aleksander Ceferin, UEFA's president since 2016.

Though the report covered the governing body's broader fiscal operations, what truly stood out was the meteoric rise in Ceferin's earnings — a detail that not only caught fans and analysts off guard but also invited direct comparison with FIFA's top brass.

Since assuming office in September 2016, Aleksander Ceferin has steadily consolidated his position at the helm of European soccer, winning re-election and steering the organization through pandemic-era uncertainties and the rapidly evolving commercial landscape of elite soccer. But while the Slovenian's leadership has often drawn praise for stability, his remuneration has quietly climbed with each passing year.

According to UEFA's latest financial report, Ceferin earned a gross salary of $3.7 million last season. This figure reflects a 13% year-on-year increase, amounting to an additional 435,000 euros compared to the previous season. That's not all. He also receives an annual stipend of almost $300,000 euros as a FIFA vice-president, a position he holds in parallel with his UEFA role. Over the course of his presidency, the Slovenian has reportedly earned nearly $19.9 million in total.

To place this in perspective, Ceferin's salary has grown by an eye-watering 108% since his first season, when he earned $1.82 million. The average annual growth rate of his compensation stands at 9.6% — a trend that has continued despite widespread conversations about financial fairness and transparency in soccer governance.

While Ceferin's earnings have certainly raised eyebrows, they still trail behind those of FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who heads the sport's global governing body.

In May 2024, FIFA revealed that Infantino's total pay package for the previous year had surpassed $4.67 million, thanks to a significant 33% raise. His base salary alone rose to over $2.78 million, while his annual bonus remained a hefty $1.87 million.

According to FIFA's financial report, “Infantino's pre-tax base salary payment rose by more than $565,000 last year [2023]… His annual bonus was worth $1.87m, the same as in 2022.”

Though Ceferin's salary comes close in raw numbers, Infantino remains the best-paid executive in world soccer, particularly when bonuses and tax arrangements are factored in. The FIFA president has been known to split his time between Switzerland, Qatar, and Florida — with the latter offering the additional financial benefit of zero state income tax.

Amid growing discomfort between the two organs, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin slammed FIFA and Gianni Infantino over the idea of expanding the 2030 World Cup.


The United States is poised to reap massive economic rewards from hosting the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 and FIFA World Cup 2026. New reports project billions in revenue and the creation of thousands of jobs for the host nation.


The newly leaked Mexico 2026 World Cup home kit, inspired by a vintage design and reminiscent of an iconic Portugal look once worn by Cristiano Ronaldo, is turning heads for more than just aesthetics. It signals a return to tradition, a connection to legacy, and a challenge to perform under immense pressure on home soil.

	RIYADH: Tourism license applications in Saudi Arabia have surged nearly fourfold since the Kingdom secured hosting rights for the 2034 FIFA World Cup, a senior official has revealed.


	Speaking at a panel discussion during the Sports Investment Forum in Riyadh, taking place from April 7 to 9, the Kingdom's Vice Minister of Tourism, Princess Haifa bint Mohammed Al-Saud, said applications had surged by 390 percent — highlighting the growing interest of international tourists and boosting economic growth, according to local broadcaster Al-Ekhbariya. 


	The increase comes as Saudi Arabia ramps up investments in sports infrastructure as part of Vision 2030, the Kingdom's strategic framework to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on oil. 


	It also aligns with the growing recognition that sports tourism is a key driver of economic development, accounting for 10 percent of global tourism expenditure and projected to grow by 17.5 percent by the end of this decade. 


	“Sports tourism has no limits. The number of tourists who came solely to attend sporting events reached 14 million by last year, spending nearly SR22 billion ($5.86 billion),” Princess Haifa said, according to a post on Al-Ekhbariya's X account. 


	“In 2018, visitors from 70 nationalities visited the Kingdom to attend sporting events, and today the number has exceeded 160 nationalities, thanks to various facilities,” she added. 


	During the session, the vice minister emphasized the role of the broader tourism ecosystem in supporting the Kingdom's sporting ambitions and contributing to sustainable economic development through public-private collaboration. 


	In November, experts told Arab News that Saudi Arabia could expect a gross domestic product boost of between $9 billion and $14 billion from the 2034 FIFA World Cup, as well as the creation of 1.5 million new jobs, and the construction of 230,000 hotel rooms developed across five host cities.


	For Saudi Arabia, key cost drivers include $378.4 million for television operations, $273.8 million for workforce management, and $124 million for transport as well as $111.1 million for team services, and $99.5 million for IT and telecommunications, according to a report released by the world football governing body in December.


	The inaugural edition of the three-day Sports Investment Forum sees local and international leaders, officials, investors, and entrepreneurs exploring opportunities in the Kingdom's evolving sports landscape. 


	The forum aims to expand the scope of sports investment in Saudi Arabia by fostering effective partnerships, attracting capital, and launching initiatives to drive growth across the sector. 


	RIYADH: Saudi telecommunication firm stc Group has been ranked the best workplace in the Kingdom, with energy giant Aramco placed second, a report by LinkedIn showed.


	Boston Consulting Group was named the best workplace in the UAE, while aviation company Emirates garnered the second rank, according to a press statement. 


	The report revealed that over one-third of companies across the lists in the Kingdom and the UAE are either major- or tech-focused companies. 


	The high placing of the companies highlights their' focus on helping employees build and secure long-term careers in a rapidly evolving work landscape, according to the business-centered social network.


	“This year's list underscores the diverse business landscape in the region, with 14 different industries showing up on the top companies lists in the UAE and Saudi Arabia,” said Nabila Rahhal, editor at LinkedIn. 


	She added: “From technology and finance to retail and energy, the rankings highlight the breadth of opportunities available and the region's continued evolution as a thriving hub for innovation, investment, and talent development.”


	Affirming the dominance of stc in the Saudi market, in February the company revealed that its net profit for 2024 reached SR24.7 billion ($6.58 billion), representing a rise of 86 percent compared to 2023. 


	In January, stc Group's financial arm, STC Bank, received a non-objection certificate from the Saudi Central Bank, also known as SAMA, to commence operations in the Kingdom.


	Saudi Aramco posted a net profit of SR398.42 billion in 2024 despite challenging market conditions, including lower prices for crude oil, refined products, and chemicals. 


	To prepare the list of best workplaces, LinkedIn uses eight key factors to determine the ranking, which include ability to advance, skills growth, company stability, as well as external opportunity. 


	Additional factors used to determine the rankings are company affinity, gender diversity, and educational background, as well as employee presence in the country. 


Best workplaces in Saudi Arabia 


	Following stc and Aramco, IT services firm EY secured the third spot, while motor vehicle manufacturer Ceer claimed fourth place on the list.


	Consulting firm Elm Co. grabbed the fifth position, followed by manufacturing company Procter and Gamble in sixth and IBM in seventh. 


	Professional services firm PwC secured eighth place on the list, while Riyad Bank placed ninth.


	In the healthcare sector, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center and Bupa were ranked 10th and 11th on the list, prompting Linkedin to write: “Making a comeback after a year's absence, the healthcare industry in Saudi Arabia is back on the map.”


	The 12th spot was secured by MATARAT Holding, followed by media giant Saudi Research and Media Group, which placed 13th.

	RIYADH: Egypt and France have signed a €7 billion ($7.6 billion) agreement to develop a large-scale green hydrogen and ammonia production complex near Ras Shokeir on the Red Sea coast. 


	The deal, which comes amid heightened economic relations between the two nations, includes the development, financing, construction, and operation of a private-sector-led facility.


	EDF Renewables and Zero Waste will lead the project in partnership with the General Authority for the Red Sea Ports and the New and Renewable Energy Authority.


	According to a joint statement by the Egyptian Ministries of Industry and Transport, the undertaking will be fully financed and implemented by the private sector consortium, with no financial commitments or infrastructure obligations from the government. 


	The initiative will be developed over three phases and is expected to produce up to 1 million tonnes of green ammonia annually, starting in 2029.


	Earlier in April, Egypt received French President Emmanuel Macron in an official visit focused on addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and strengthening bilateral economic cooperation.


	Macron participated in the Franco-Egyptian Business Forum, where discussions emphasized increasing French investment in Egypt and expanding collaboration in renewable energy, infrastructure, and industry. 


	The hydrogen agreement signed during the visit was among the most significant outcomes, aligning with Egypt's strategy to become a regional hub for clean energy and green fuel exports.


	Egypt's Deputy Prime Minister for Industrial Development and Minister of Industry and Transport Kamel El-Wazir emphasized that the project aligns with national directives to localize the green hydrogen industry and position Egypt as a regional and global leader for progressive environmental practices. 


	He stated that this initiative reflects the distinguished relationship between the political leaderships and peoples of both countries and highlights their shared commitment to strategic cooperation for mutual benefit and development.


	The first phase of the project will require €2 billion in direct investment and aims to produce 300,000 tonnes of green ammonia per year. 


	EDF Renewables Chairwoman Beatrice Buffon and Zero Waste Chairman Amr El-Sawaf signed the agreement alongside Egyptian energy officials. The combined investment across all three phases is projected to reach €7 billion, entirely financed by the project company.


	The minister noted that 368 sq. km of land in Ras Shokeir have been allocated for solar and wind energy generation to power the facility, while 1.2 million sq. meters will be used to construct the integrated industrial plant. 


	The project also includes the construction of a 400-meter export jetty with a 17-meter draft, as well as a 7-km transmission corridor. A dedicated seawater desalination unit will supply the project's water needs.


	El-Wazir said that this is one of the few long-term projects in Egypt being implemented entirely by the private sector, without any reliance on public infrastructure or electricity grid services, highlighting that the investment is structured to recover costs over a 50-year period. 


	The state will benefit from licensing fees, land-use charges, export duties, and taxes— all to be paid in US dollars.


	Beyond direct revenues, the undertaking is expected to generate thousands of jobs during the construction and operational phases. 


	The consortium has committed to training and employing local labor, with a goal of reaching 95 percent Egyptian participation in the project's workforce.


	El-Wazir added that the initiative will also support the localization of green energy components, including electrolyzers, solar panels, and wind turbines.


	This undertaking strengthens Egypt's position in the global renewable energy landscape and contributes to the country's transition toward a green economy, El-Wazir explained. 


	He also noted its alignment with Egypt's climate commitments under the Paris Agreement and COP27, as well as its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and preserve natural gas reserves by providing sustainable alternatives for the energy and industrial sectors.


	The minister also underscored the strategic importance of providing green fuel for ships transiting the Suez Canal and developing a new Red Sea port under the Red Sea Ports Authority without any fiscal burden on the government.


	RIYADH: Kuwait has signed a 2.5 million Kuwaiti dinars ($8.1 million) contract for the design and planning of its section of the regional rail network, marking a step forward in the realization of the Gulf Railway Project first conceived in 2009. 


	The agreement with Turkish consultancy firm Proyapi marks the official launch of Kuwait's participation in this Gulf Cooperation Council-wide infrastructure initiative, bringing the long-delayed project closer to reality. 


	The 2,177-km GCC railway will connect Kuwait City to Muscat via Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, and the UAE, with most of the route running through Saudi and Emirati territory.


	Construction is already underway in the UAE, Oman, and Saudi Arabia, and the project aims to boost regional trade, travel, and tourism. 


	Kuwait's Public Works Minister, Noura Al-Mashaan, said that “the railway project comes in line with the visions of the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries to establish a passenger and freight railway network linking the GCC countries,” the Kuwait News Agency, also known as KUNA, reported. . 


	Kuwait is set to be the northern terminus of the network, with its portion covering 111 km. The route will extend from Al-Shadadiya — where a major train station will be constructed on a site spanning 2 million sq. meters— to Al-Nuwaiseeb at the Saudi border. 


	The contract signing ceremony was attended by Turkiye's Ambassador to Kuwait, Tuba Nur Sonmez.


	The agreement encompasses design and engineering studies, soil testing, route mapping, and the preparation of tender documents for the subsequent construction phase. Once the design work is finalized, Kuwait will move forward with inviting bids for the actual construction. 


	Ahmed Al-Saleh, assistant undersecretary for planning and development and official spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Works, highlighted the railway's far-reaching impact.


	“The project has great social and economic importance for the smooth transport of passengers and goods,” he said, according to the KUNA report, adding that it is being implemented in line with “the desire of the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.” 


	In April 2024, Hafeet Rail began implementing the Oman-UAE connection, marking the first operational GCC link in the regional network. The 238-km stretch will connect Sohar Port in Oman to Abu Dhabi, integrating with the UAE's national rail system and significantly reducing travel times. Passenger trains will cover the Sohar-Abu Dhabi route in just 100 minutes, according to the Hafeet Rail website. 


	During the 26th meeting of GCC transport ministers in Doha in November, officials reaffirmed the project's advancement toward its 2030 completion target. GCC Secretary-General Jasem Mohamed Al-Budaiwi highlighted Hafeet Rail as a key milestone, emphasizing its role in creating a unified transport and logistics network across the region. 


	JEDDAH: Saudi shipping firm Folk Maritime Services Co. has purchased its second vessel in a sign of the growing strength of the Kingdom's logistics sector.


	The company, which is owned by the Public Investment Fund, described the acquisition of the M/V Folk Jazan as a significant step forward in enhancing regional maritime connectivity.


	The addition of the second vessel aligns with Saudi Arabia's National Logistics Strategy, which aims to increase the sector's contribution to the gross domestic product from 6 percent to 10 percent by 2030.


	Registered at Jeddah Islamic Port, the vessel has begun operating on the company's routes across the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf, offering cost-effective and efficient logistics services that will drive trade growth.


	The company's CEO, Poul Hestbaek, said the acquisition of M/V Folk Jazan expands the firm's operational capabilities and reinforces Folk's commitment to supporting Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030.


	“Folk Maritime's strategic acquisition of its second owned Saudi-flagged container vessel, part of an expanding fleet now totaling six ships, significantly enhances the company's operational flexibility and reduces dependency on chartered vessels,” Hestbaek noted.


	The CEO noted that his company's fleet expansion, which started with the purchase of “Folk Jeddah” in September, now operating out of Jeddah Islamic Port, significantly strengthens trade operations and underscores Folk Maritime's dedication to increasing its contributions to the regional economy. 


	Built in 2008 by Zhejiang Shipbuilding Co. in China, Folk Jazan has a nominal capacity of 2,015 twenty-foot equivalent units, enhancing operational flexibility and greatly expanding Folk Maritime's service network, the company stated in a press release. 


	Engineered to meet the demands of modern containerized shipping, the vessel achieves a critical balance between capacity and operational efficiency, ensuring reliable service.


	Established in 2023 and commencing operations in April 2024, Folk Maritime is dedicated to enhancing the Kingdom's maritime connectivity by providing reliable shipping solutions that support regional trade.


	Through the expansion of its fleet, the company has strengthened the local supply chain and created jobs.


National drive for maritime connectivity


	In March, the Saudi Ports Authority, also known as Mawani, announced Mediterranean Shipping Co. would launch the new “Clanga” shipping line at Jubail Commercial Port, a move aimed at bolstering the Kingdom's investment and logistics landscape, according to the Saudi Press Agency.


	The new service will link Jubail with King Abdulaziz Port in Dammam, the Port of Singapore, the Port of Shanghai in China, and the Port of Colombo in Sri Lanka, with a handling capacity of up to 6,000 TEUs.


	In February, Mawani also revealed the introduction of five new shipping services by Hapag-Lloyd and Maersk, serving Jeddah Islamic Port, King Abdulaziz Port in Dammam, and Jubail Commercial Port.


	According to the authority, these services will further connect Saudi ports to major regional and international hubs, including Aqaba in Jordan, Port Said in Egypt, and Tangier in Morocco, as well as Algeciras in Spain, Jebel Ali in the UAE, Mundra and Pipavav in India, and Salalah in Oman.


	KARACHI: Haball, a Pakistan fintech firm, raised $52 million to expand its Shariah-compliant supply chain financing and payments services, the company said on Tuesday.
	The funding, led by Zayn VC and Meezan Bank, includes $5 million in equity and $47 million in strategic financing and will support Haball's growth plans for Pakistan, the company said in a statement.
	The money will also help Haball's expansion into the Middle East, starting with Saudi Arabia this year, it added.
	“Supply chain finance in Pakistan is nascent but is expected to be worth over $9 billion; driven by the severe financing gap faced by the country's SMEs – less than 5 percent can access financing from commercial banks,” the company statement said.
	Islamic banking and finance has been growing rapidly in Pakistan, the world's second most populous Muslim country, with assets reaching 9,689 billion Pakistani rupees ($34.54 billion)at the end of June 2024, according to the Quarterly Islamic Banking Bulletin released by the State Bank of Pakistan.
	The market share of assets and deposits of the Islamic banking sector in the overall banking industry stood at 18.8 percent and 22.7 percent, respectively.
	The central bank has a target of 30 percent of overall banking assets and deposits to be Islamic by this year, according to its strategic plans for 2023-2028.
	Haball says it provides shariah-compliant financing to nearly 8,000 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as multinationals, in addition to digital invoicing, payment collection, and tax compliance services.
	“Haball has processed over $3 billion in payments and disbursed over $110 million in financing – optimizing supply chains across the country,” said the firm's founder and CEO, Omer bin Ahsan.
	Islamic finance bans interest payments and pure monetary speculation and can only be used to invest in Shariah-compliant assets or portfolios. ($1 = 280.5000 Pakistani rupees)

...

Legendary Inter Milan defender Marco Materazzi waxed lyrical about the current Nerazzurri squad during his latest interview.

In an interview made for the Menu di Giornata series by JustEat via FCInterNews, Materazzi confessed he nearly joined AC Milan.

Marco Materazzi spent ten years at Giuseppe Meazza.

During his trophy-laden spell at Inter, he won 14 major titles, including an unprecedented treble in 2010 under Jose Mourinho.

Indeed, Materazzi was part of the team that won five consecutive Serie A trophies between 2006 and 2010.

Furthermore, he won the Champions League and FIFA Club World Cup before leaving the club in 2011.

Known as a fierce competitor, Materazzi inspired fear among rivals and was among Europe's finest defenders.

However, he nearly swapped Inter for Milan on the eve of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

“I wasn't getting much playing time at Inter and I wanted to go to the World Cup in Germany,” he stated.

“I didn't want to lose my spot, so I spoke to Marcello Lippi.

“He told me that even if I only played once every ten matches, he would still call me up.

“Giacinto Facchetti, who was like a father to me, told me to stay at Inter and not to go to the other side of Milan because they needed my help.

“He promised I'd play enough to make the World Cup squad.

“It wasn't easy for me because Inter fans loved me, and the other side hated me.

“But waiting for me over there was Gennaro Gattuso, who's a great friend of mine.”

Simone Inzaghi could replicate Mourinho's heroics this season and bring another treble to the San Siro.

However, the road is long and treacherous, with Inter facing numerous obstacles.

For instance, they must overcome runaway Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich to reach the Champions League semi-finals.

Yet, as the competition's best defense, Inzaghi's charges look well-prepared for this challenge.

“Inter have already kept eight clean sheets in the Champions League, which is incredible,” Materazzi said.

“But the next round against Bayern won't be easy because the two teams are on the same level.

“And they have Harry Kane, who's aiming to win his first trophy.

“I think this Inter play better than mine, but if the two teams faced each other, we'd still beat them!

“We may not have been the prettiest to watch, but we were strong enough to score.

“Who knows, maybe it'd end 1-0 – but definitely not 3-0.”

Finally, Materazzi compared himself to Virgil van Dijk and Alessandro Nesta.

While acknowledging the qualities of the two football greats, he believes he falls into the same category.

“I'm the one who scared people the most on the pitch – I'm great, and I hate losing.”

The U.S. women's national team will wrap up a two-game series against Brazil on Tuesday. In another anticipated friendly, the group will get another chance to work on tactics against a Brazil side with technical quality and attacking ability. Manager Emma Hayes and the squad will host Brazil at a sold-out Pay Pal Park in San Jose, California. Brazil will look to bounce back after a 2-0 loss to the USWNT on Saturday. 

Forward Trinity Rodman made an enthusiastic return to the senior team, getting on the scoreboard in her first game back since the 2024 Olympic final. The prolific winger was part of the attacking "triple espresso" trio that dominated scoresheets during the Olympics and was managing a back injury before her return.

Hayes will likely continue with the player rotations as the program builds towards the 2027-28 cycle, and fans can anticipate some changes ahead of match day two. The head coach has been steadfast in player evaluations and two players earned their first senior caps on Saturday. Goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce earned the clean sheet and Avery Patterson was a late sub to help close out the game.

Here are storylines, how you can watch the match and more:

Match one against Brazil: Prior to Saturday's meeting, the two teams met during the 2024 Paris Olympics in the gold medal final. During the friendly rematch, Rodman's lone goal came in the opening six minutes, despite Brazil setting the tempo early. But a tactical shift by the South Americans kept the match narrow into halftime. Hayes won the substitution battle on the sideline after Lily Yohannes entered the match, and immediately earned a penalty. Team captain Lindsey Heaps converted the attempt and the USWNT kept Brazil's attack quiet thanks to a big six save game by Tullis-Joyce.

For all the discussion of the expanded player pool, there's also the responsibility of game planning and preparation for so many new players to the program. Hayes is already looking ahead to game two for improvements against Brazil. 

"I feel we do all the hard work, we get the ball and we turn it back over again. We call it transition to retain. This is an area of our game we have to get better with," Hayes said during postgame comments. 

"We've certainly given the team the framework. Then you have to give the team the opportunity to develop it, and then you coach all the minute details that go with that. And I think by the end, we'd got a better handle on that, but it took us quite a while to get there today, as it did against Japan [in SheBelieves Cup]. So I think this is a big area for us, because we're not afraid to back press, and we're not afraid to go player for player in situations, but we need to be a little more decisive in the decision-making and execution of things."

Hayes also expanded on the groups decision-making when in transition during attacking scenarios, and when to recognize going quickly or recycing the ball. 

"I don't know the xG of the game, but I felt we created good chances, and I think we're getting more. I know this for a fact, that our xG in general is increasing, and our --  as I call them, the golden the gold zones -- chances are definitely significantly higher than they were at the Olympics. That's something we really have been conscious to work on, whether that's getting the right numbers into the right area, hitting the right areas, Getting the timings right. I can't talk for the goals Brazil could and should have scored. I can only talk for us, but I think we could have scored more than two goals ... and I certainly couldn't have said that in the Olympic gold medal final."

The USWNT ended match one with an xG of 2.72, which doubled Brazil's total xG of 1.41.

Anything is possible during this Hayes era of player evaluation, here's who we think could get the start on Sunday.

USWNT Starting XI: Mandy McGlynn, Giselle Thompson, Emily Sams, Alana Cook, Avery Patterson; Korbin Albert, Lily Yohannes, Jaedyn Shaw; Yazmeen Ryan, Ashley Hatch, Michelle Cooper

Yazmeen Ryan (forward): The Houston Dash attacker has rapidly become a regular in team camps since her first official senior call-up in October 2024. She's bumped her caps up to eight, after subbing in against Brazil on Saturday, and has two assists in her short time with the program. She has versatility in both wide and central roles, and her ability to create scoring opportunities with sharp crossing will be an asset on Tuesday. 

Goalkeeper trends: While Tullis-Joyce earned her first cap on Saturday, McGlynn might earn her third. McGlynn was among multiple players called post-2024 Olympics as Hayes began her planning for the next cycle. The coaching staff has evaluated the role after Alyssa Naeher's retirement, and Jane Campbell has been the most capped keeper in camps with 10 appearances and six clean sheets. Hayes has a summer timeline to narrow down the keeper pool and hone in on a starter moving forward.

The beauty of a second match against a similar opponent is that there is a familiarity to build off. The downside is that the other team likely feels the same way. The USWNT get the win, but Brazil get on the board. Pick: USWNT 2,  Brazil 1

Omar Marmoush has decided to represent Manchester City at the FIFA Club World Cup between June and July and will not join the Egypt National Team camp, as per a new report.

Manchester City will participate in the 32-club, newly-formatted tournament in the United States to round off the 2024-25 season, hoping to pick up more silverware after winning the FA Community Shield in August and vying for an eighth FA Cup title.

Pep Guardiola's side will finish the tournament in mid-July and spend pre-season to prepare for the 2025-26 season, with incoming sporting director Hugo Viana – who officially started work in Manchester on Monday – set to back Guardiola heavily in the transfer market.

     

City are expected to make wholesale changes to their first-team after signing the quartet of Abdukodir Khusanov, Omar Marmoush, Vitor Reis and Nico Gonzalez for a combined £181.5 million in January to give Guardiola a helping hand amidst a treacherous fitness period for the Blues.

Marmoush's arrival from Eintracht Frankfurt following a stellar first half of the season in the Bundesliga has been an exciting prospect and something to cheer about for Manchester City fans in what has largely been a disappointing campaign for the club.

The 26-year-old has scored six times and provided an assist in 13 outings in all competitions for the Premier League champions since his arrival, scoring a hat-trick against Newcastle United in the Premier League and the winner in the FA Cup quarter-final against Bournemouth.

In the absence of Erling Haaland – who is expected to be out for a month-and-a-half after injuring his ankle against Bournemouth – the goalscoring burden will naturally fall upon Marmoush to deliver the goods and step up in the business end of City's season amidst their top-four chase and FA Cup run.

As reported by Ismael Mahmoud, Marmoush will stay on with Manchester City at the FIFA Club World Cup in the United States and will not be joining up with the Egypt National Team in June.

This is a massive personnel boost for Guardiola and Manchester City, who are waiting for a decision on Kevin De Bruyne's availability for the tournament after the 33-year-old confirmed he will be leaving the club in the coming months, amid recent interest from Inter Miami CF in the Major League Soccer.

Marmoush has been a breath of fresh air in a Manchester City attack that has struggled for creative inspiration and often in the absence of Haaland has failed to put the ball in the back of the net over the course of the campaign.

 Casper Ruud  was the last player who faced  Rafael Nadal  in the French Open final. Nadal last lifted a Grand Slam at the 2022 Roland Garros after breezing past Ruud 6-3, 6-3, 6-0.

Those who have faced Nadal in Paris know very well how brutal he can be in his favorite tournament. Ruud experienced the same when he reached the summit clash of the clay-court Major for the first time in his career.

My final against Rafa wasn't so fun because I was outclassed, even though the score was harsh. If you look at history, I'm not the first to experience that. It helps put things into perspective. Before going on court, I saw myself again at 14, a spectator at Centre Court watching one of his many victories. At that age, I dreamed of facing him one day.

Despite the easy defeat, Ruud cherishes the match. It was the first time he locked horns with the 22-time Grand Slam champion in his career. The same year, they again met in the round-robin stage of the ATP Finals which Nadal won.

Well, when you see him on the other side of the net, it's rather surreal! If the match had been more close, I would have liked to play more aggressively. I'm more proud of being the last person to have faced him in a final at Roland-Garros.

Ruud had another chance to take home the French Open, for he had progressed to the summit clash the following season. But this time, Novak Djokovic was his opponent who claimed a straight-set win to lift his 22nd Grand Slam title and his third at the Roland Garros.

Nadal, at the 2023 Australian Open, suffered a hip injury which eventually forced him to call time on his career. The 38-year-old hung up his racket at the Davis Cup last year.

Casper Ruud will kick-start his Monte Carlo Masters campaign against Roberto Bautista Agut. The Spaniard knocked out Brandon Nakashima to set up the clash with the Norwegian. Ruud has met the 36-year-old four times and lost three of those matches. They first locked horns in Munich back in 2018 which Agut won. 

Following their first encounter, they clashed in the 2022 ATP Cup, 2022 Canadian Open, and the 2024 Swiss Indoors. The only time Ruud was successful in securing a win was in the fourth round of the Canadian Open. The upcoming match will be their second meeting on clay.

Ruud was last year's runner-up in The Principality. He faced Stefanos Tsitsipas who breezed past him 6-1, 6-4 to claim his third title in the tournament. Ruud so has reached just one final in the season. Following his disappointing campaign at the Australian Open, the 26-year-old came close to lifting the Dallas Open but Denis Shapovalov denied him the win in the final.

He is expected to have decent campaigns on the clay swing this season as he has established himself as one of the best players on the red dirt in recent years. If Ruud reaches the quarterfinals, he could set up a clash with 2025 Indian Wells champion Jack Draper.

In the semifinals, he is projected to meet World No.3 Carlos Alcaraz, who will be playing in the tournament for the second time in his career following the 2022 season. In the final, Ruud could meet World No.5 and two-time Monte Carlo Masters champion Novak Djokovic, who will once again be chasing his 100th ATP title after being denied the same by Jakub Mensik in the Miami Open final.

There are many questions about the 21-year-old's form. He's already defused them all.ByPeter BodoPublished Apr 08, 2025 copy_link

Carlos Alcaraz is still just 21, but he's already challenging some of the received wisdom about a champion's mentality—how a great one approaches the game, deals with adversity and views rivals.The No. 3-ranked Spaniard faced a slew of questions from reporters when he met with them before the start of this week's Monte Carlo Masters. Everyone wanted to know how he feels about leaving the Sunshine Double without having made a final. Is he concerned that the only tournament he's won this year is the indoor Rotterdam event? Is he concerned about the state of his game?All good, solid questions, all easily handled and defused by Alcaraz. He is no closer to displacing No. 1 -anked Jannik Sinner at the top of the ATP rankings than he was back in February, when Sinner was banished from the game for three months for a doping violation.It doesn't appear to perturb Alcaraz at all.“I am really happy with the way I am playing,” Alcaraz told the reporters. “Since I started the year I have been playing great tennis. Tennis is not just about hitting the ball. It is about more than that. It is about mentality, physical side.”

The idea that tennis is not just about “hitting the ball” with positive outcomes, or even that life is not just about tennis, has been overlooked often by great players, sometimes for long periods of time. Their anxiety at a loss of form, their rationalizations of a decline in the rankings, their anger when a blinkered fealty to the W-L column fails to pay off can be a painful experience, often played out in the public eye.But Alcaraz is lousy at creating drama. He is a happy warrior, who takes setbacks—such as they are, for one of his class—in stride. Already a four-time Grand Slam singles champion, Alcaraz has Olympian talent and ambitions. But his attitude is different from that of other giants of the game. It shows in the way he plays the game.

Tennis is not just about hitting the ball. It is about more than that. Carlos Alcaraz

Alcaraz will often choose to try the spectacular shot instead of the safer, smart one. He thereby shatters one of the chief commandments of winning tennis, one that applies at every level. Of course, he does it because it brings him satisfaction. It gives him joy, which is an emotion players are urged to check before first ball, as if it were a piece of oversized baggage.“The guys that win majors are somewhat predictable when it really counts,” elite coach and ESPN analyst Patrick McEnroe told me in a recent conversation. “But Alcaraz has moved a little bit away from that. He's an amazing shotmaker with a level of athleticism that's just off the charts. That has hurt him in the last nine months. In that sense, he's too much of a shotmaker. He hits his way into trouble.”Alcaraz doesn't appear to have regrets. He also bemoaned the way that, win or lose, the focus in matches is almost always on him. When he suffers an upset, some suspect that “something is going on.” He said that isn't fair to those who beat him, who do it on the strength of great tennis.

If Novak Djokovic were listening, he might have bobbed his head right along with Alcaraz. At 37, and finding those precious Ws considerably more difficult to come by, the No. 3 seed in Monte Carlo has come to value the time he still has left on court regardless of the result.It once took a Grand Slam singles title to satisfy Dokovic, and chasing it had very little to do with being “happy.” Now, he told the press in Monte Carlo, he's found that “joy” that comes from playing well in Miami, even though he was beaten in a barnburner of a final by a still-green newcomer, 19-year-old Jakob Mensik.

Alcaraz and Djokovic are on opposite sides of the draw. A meeting between them in the final would be a great table setter for the clay-court season. Djokovic is hopeful but—old habits die hard—worried that he may not be as well prepared as he'd like on the red clay.Alcaraz has reason to feel concern as well, but you'd never know it.“I am just happy,” he said, “and ready to play well on clay.”

Jannik Sinner has been a notable absentee from the ATP Tour in recent weeks as he serves a three-month suspension for a doping violation and former world No 1 Andy Roddick believes what comes next could shape a few agendas in years to come.

Sinner accepted a short ban from tennis amid the threat of a one-year suspension if he had taken his case against the World Anti-Doping Agenda all the way to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

It means world No 1 Sinner has missed recent tournaments in Indian Wells and Miami and he will also miss the start of the clay court season, including ATP Masters 1000 events in Monte Carlo and Madrid.

While he has been denied the chance to challenge for world ranking points and big money, his time away from the court could work in his favour if he returns refreshed and revived against opponents who have had hectic schedules on court in his absence.

Speaking on the latest edition of his Served podcast, former US Open champion pondered whether Sinner would benefit from the break away from tennis as he targets his first French Open title at Roland Garros.

“I don't think you are ever a winner when you get suspended for three months… but will he look back in a year in a half and say you know what, that was decent. I had a pretty hectic schedule, played two majors (this summer), was there a benefit to it? Maybe,” said Roddick.

“What's going to happen is one of two things. He's not going to play as well in Rome or the French Open and by the way, it's not his best surface, so we are going to overreact to whatever the result is for Jannik Sinner when he comes back.

“We will say ‘that really hurt him' if he loses in Rome, or if he loses in the semi-finals of the French Open, but that could have happened [whether he was banned or not].

Roddick went on to suggest Sinner and other players may look at how the Italian reacts to his unwanted time away from tennis and may conclude that taking a break after the ATP 1000 tournaments in Indian Wells and Miami is a shrewd move in preparation for the French Open.

The question here is how will other players react if a fresh and hungry Sinner springs back into top gear and performs well in Rome at the French Open, would that encourage other players to take some time off at the start of the clay court season in years to come?

“What will be curious is moving forward, with this three-month gap, with the schedule being too busy, maybe he takes parts of this three months [off],” he added.

“Maybe he says I play Indian Wells and Miami and I doesn't play Monte Carlo. I get a later start, I buy myself during the clay court season to refresh.

“So I think this experience may be a good learning tool and maybe you take the good parts of it. We'll see.”

Sinner spoke at length about his decision to accept a doping ban for the first time in an interview with Sky Italy, as he reflected on a tough decision that he felt forced to take.

‘I really believe Jannik Sinner can win the Calendar Grand Slam this year'

Exclusive: Has ‘more consistent' Jannik Sinner's absence fuelled Carlos Alcaraz criticism?

“The decision to take the three-month suspension was rather quick. We accepted it quite quickly, even though I didn't agree completely. There was a bit of back and forth with my lawyer and the people around me,” the Italian said. “After we took this decision, it took me a while to find myself again.

“But I am still here. There is still a bit of time to digest all this, but I can't wait to be back in Rome. It's a special tournament for me, even though it will also very tough. I'll be back in a moment in which there will be already a lot of attention on me, and in Rome it's not easy.

“I was very fragile after what happened. I would tell a lie if I said I was a person without feelings or emotions. In life you learn, every year I learn more about myself, also about my values. It was not easy, very hard at times, but the people around me gave me the strength to understand what had happened.”

He remains unsure how other players on the tour will react to his return.

“I can't answer this question as I don't know what could happen,” he said. “I know how things went, I know I am innocent.

“I am calm because, in the end, I know that what I want to do is to play tennis and be serene. That's the end of the story. So, I am sure all will go well, even if at the beginning it will take a while to start over. These are questions I don't know how to answer.”

Sinner has confirmed he will return to action at the Rome Masters next month, where he is set to be the top seed.

Matteo Berrettini earned the biggest win of his career by PIF ATP Ranking on Tuesday, when he overcame World No. 2 Alexander Zverev 2-6, 6-3, 7-5 in a Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters epic.

Competing in front of a raucous crowd on Court Rainier III, Berrettini produced one of his best performances in recent years to reach the third round in The Principality for just the second time and improve to 3-4 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Zverev.

"The game plan was the same but I changed my attitude and the way I was believing in my strokes," said Berrettini, who won 14 of 15 first-serve points in the second set, according to Infosys ATP Stats. "I wasn't hitting my forehand and serve like I had in previous days and I had to adapt and adjust to the conditions and Sascha was playing unbelievable, so it was not easy. Then I told myself to be more aggressive and if I am going to lose this match, I am going to do the right things and luckily it worked."

In a tense encounter, Berrettini failed to serve out the match at 5-4 but recovered in style. At 5-5, 40/40, he won an absorbing 48-shot rally with a forehand winner and then earned the break when Zverev was unable to retrieve the ball in the backhand corner.

Pumped up, the 28-year-old did not falter at the second time of asking, sealing victory on serve to triumph after two hours and 27 minutes. Following his dramatic win, the World No. 34 raised his arms aloft and soaked in the roars from the sunbaked crowd.

Berrettini has won 17 of his past 18 matches on clay. Last season, the 28-year-old lifted ATP Tour clay-court titles in Marrakech, Gstaad and Kitzbuhel, while he defeated Mariano Navone in his Monte-Carlo opener in his first match on the surface on Monday.

"I grew up on clay, playing on it until 19," Berrettini said. "On Tour we don't play on it as much but at the same time I have missed the biggest tournament on clay for the past three years and that was tough and now I want to enjoy it. I feel really comfortable on clay."

He will next play Jiri Lehecka or countryman Lorenzo Musetti, who was the last Italian to defeat a Top-2 opponent on clay prior to Berrettini (Djokovic Monte-Carlo 2023).







Zverev suffered disappointing quarter-final exits on clay earlier this year in Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro. The 27-year-old will next head to the ATP 500 event on home soil in Munich.
In other action, Italian Flavio Cobolli backed up his Bucharest title by moving past Dusan Lajovic 6-4, 6-2 in his opening match in Monte-Carlo. Cobolli, who defeated Sebastian Baez in Romania to win his first ATP Tour title, will play Arthur Fils in the second round after the Frenchman beat Tallon Griekspoor 6-7(3), 6-4, 6-2.
Fils arrived in Monte-Carlo in good recent form, having advanced to the quarter-finals in Indian Wells and Miami. The 20-year-old is making his second appearance in The Principality. 
Tomas Martin Etcheverry moved past Corentin Moutet 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, while Roberto Bautista Agut downed Brandon Nakashima 6-2, 6-4. Tomas Machac defeated Baez 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 and will next meet eighth seed Alex de Minaur.

Former world number one Mats Wilander has made a bold prediction ahead of the upcoming French Open, naming Germany's Alexander Zverev as a top contender for the prestigious title.

Wilander, a tennis legend himself, expressed his confidence in Zverev's ability to bounce back from a recent slump in form, attributing it to a natural reaction following disappointing results. Reflecting on his own experiences, Wilander emphasized the significant impact of winning or losing a Grand Slam final on a player's confidence.

The 60-year-old tennis icon remarked, “I do think he is going to be back. He is too good a player, he works too hard.” Wilander highlighted Zverev's strong work ethic and confidence against other players as key factors that will likely propel him back into top form.

Zverev, who had a remarkable run at Roland Garros last year, reaching the final before falling to Spain's Carlos Alcaraz in a thrilling five-set match, has proven his capabilities on the clay court.

As the tennis world eagerly anticipates the start of the French Open on May 25, all eyes will be on Zverev to see if he can fulfill Wilander's prophecy and emerge as a formidable contender for the prestigious title once again.

Jannik Sinner has been backed to be “strong” as soon as he returns from his three-month doping ban by his former coach Riccardo Piatti.

The world No 1 has not played since January, when he defended his Australian Open title with a straight sets win over Alexander Zverev in the final in Melbourne.

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) announced on February 15 that it had reached a deal with Sinner‘s representatives for the Italian to serve a suspension from February 9 until May 4 (his ban also includes four days previously served while he was under a provisional suspension).

Sinner tested positive for the banned anabolic steroid clostebol twice in March 2024 — during and after the Indian Wells Masters.

The three-time major winner initially avoided a ban when The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) revealed in August that an independent tribunal ruled he carried “no fault or negligence.”

However, WADA appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) over the ITIA's ruling in September, seeking to impose a ban of between one and two years on Sinner. The case was scheduled to be heard at the CAS from April 16-17 until Sinner's agreement with WADA.

The 23-year-old has already missed events in Doha, Indian Wells, Miami and Monte Carlo, while he will also be unable to play the Madrid Open.

Sinner will make his comeback at the Italian Open, a Masters 1000 tournament that will begin on May 7. He will then be able to play the French Open.

Piatti, who coached Sinner from the age of 13 to 20, has expressed his belief that his former charge is capable of winning all four Grand Slam tournaments in 2025.

“He will be strong right away [after he returns from the ban],” he told Corriere della Sera. “I really believe that this year he can do the Grand Slam.

“The suspension has extended his life: he will arrive at the end of the season fresh. You play too much, mentally you never stop. He will return charged and motivated. He always has been.

“During the pandemic many took advantage of it to not train. Gasquet, during the doping stop, gained eight kilos. Jannik has not missed a day. He knows perfectly where he wants to go.”

The 66-year-old Italian coach also identified the reason for his split with Sinner in February 2022.

“Everyone remembers the match with [Taro] Daniel, in Melbourne, in January 2022, when he said: calm down, damn it,” Piatti explained.

“He was angry with me for things on the pitch, it had already happened other times: it's normal dynamics between coach and player. That's not the problem.

“I always wanted Jannik to become independent, I knew that one day he would leave. But with him, I had to be the rigorous coach, sometimes rigid: it was my role.

“[Ivan] Ljubicic reproaches me for telling him: you decide too, Ivan, but then do as I say. For Jannik, this penalty, at a certain point, was too much to bear.”

On whether it bothers him that Sinner has not mentioned him since they parted ways, Piatti added: “No, it doesn't bother me. I know him, I know players. How they are, how they think. They always look forward, never back.

“I don't see it as ingratitude — Jannik does his job, he doesn't have to thank anyone. Nor do I feel there's anything to clarify with him. Tennis is a sport where ego plays a big role.”

      Former world number one Mats Wilander believes that Germany's Alexander Zverev will be one of the favourites to lift the title at the French
Open. The second Grand Slam of the year will begin on May 25, where players from all over the world will compete to secure the ultimate prize.  


      Former world number one Wilander has been recently quoted in
a re port by Tennis 365, where he was labelled as one of the favourites to lift the
title. The 60-year-old was of the opinion that the German tennis star's recent
slump in form is a ‘natural reaction'.  


      “Now that I watched him play, I do feel that he looks… I
wouldn't say he is tired, but he looks a little bit like ‘Okay I kind of had
enough at the moment' and I think it is a natural reaction,” he said. “I can
only speak from experience, once I lost a Grand Slam final, the difference
between winning a Grand Slam in terms of confidence and losing a final is like
night and day. You would think it wouldn't be that big a difference because you
win six matches and you win seven matches [when you win the final].”   


      He continued by saying: “But to win six matches and lose in
the final, it takes you two to three months before you figure out first of all
‘what the hell happened', second of all ‘I had my chances' or third, even worse
‘I didn't have my chances'. I think that's what Zverev is dealing with [as he
might think] ‘I didn't actually have my chances in that match'. And that is
feeling awful right now. Right now [Zverev is thinking] ‘I am not sure I think
I can beat any player in the world'. So I think it's a natural dip in his form
and I do think he is going to be back. He is too good a player, he works too
hard. I think his confidence against normal players is too high for him to lose
early. I think by the time Madrid comes around, which is one of his favourite tournaments on clay, I do think we are going to be talking about Sascha Zverev as one of the contenders at the French Open again.”  


      Zverev had an impressive outing at Roland Garros last year, where he finished as the runner-up after losing to Spain's Carlos Alcaraz in the final in a five-set thriller with a score of 6–3, 2–6, 5–7, 6–1, 6–2.

Holger Rune had a dreadful start to the clay season when he crashed of the ATP tournament in Monte Carlo in the first round to Nuno Borges.

The Dane lost the first set 6-2 and subsequently called a doctor over to examine him in between the first and the second set. 

Rune told the doctor that he had been suffering from illness in the days leading up to the tournament. 

Rune returned to the court in the second set, but down 3-0 the Dane chose to withdraw.

"It's a tournament that means so much to him. This hurts", said his mother and agent Aneke Rune after the match.

Holger Rune lives in Monaco on a daily basis and trains on these courts, which made it even more painful for him to retire today. 

"I simply don't understand how he can be so unlucky. I know there are two other players who also have a stomach virus. But why Holger again?"

He hasn't been out, he's been sleeping and living healthily. It's terrible for him to be hit right here. It could happen at any other tournament, but just not right here", said Aneke Rune to TV Sport.

The next tournament for Holger Rune will be the the ATP 500 tournament in Barcelona.

With tennis moving over to clay courts, one ATP youngster has already made waves with his performances on the surface.

Three champions have been crowned on the ATP Tour just one week into the clay court season.

America's Jenson Brooksby won his first tour-level title in Houston, taking down Frances Tiafoe, 6-4, 6-2 in the final.

In Morocco, Luciano Darderi clinched his second career title with a tight two-set win over Tallon Griekspoor, 7-6, 7-6.

It was arguably another Italian youngster, however, that impressed the most, with one former American star predicting big things for the 22-year-old.

Speaking on the Nothing Major podcast, Jack Sock shared his thoughts on the 2025 Romanian Open champion.

“He [Flavio Cobolli] is already top 40 in the world and has just won a tournament, I think that is only going to help him for the rest of the year or the rest of the clay court season,” he said.

“I think the confidence that he needed from one awesome week like that and probably off to the races now, would be my guess, the guy is very good.”

Cobolli won the first title of his career in Bucharest, dropping just one set on his way to victory.

The American then revealed what he thought about Cobolli when he watched him play in 2024.

“I remember watching this guy last year somewhere and before [Joao] Fonseca I thought this guy was the next guy,” he said.

Former Wimbledon semi-finalist Sam Querrey disagreed with Sock's Cobolli assessment but admitted he would be gladly proven wrong.

“I think he is really good but I am not going to give him the off to the races,” said Querrey.

“I think he will win some matches in Madrid, Rome, and Monte-Carlo and hover around 40 [in the world].

“I like him though, I hope he proves me wrong.”

Before traveling to Romania, Cobolli had struggled for form, losing seven consecutive matches on the ATP Tour.

The 22-year-old picked up two wins at the United Cup to kick off the year but then embarked on a seven-match winless run.

Cobolli's title in Bucharest came at the perfect time, as the Italian can now approach the remainder of the European clay season with confidence.

The world number 35 is currently scheduled to take part in four ATP tournaments before the French Open.

Cobolli will begin his campaign in the principality with a tough test in the first round against 2019 finalist Dusan Lajovic.

Tennis

The king is dead, long live the king. As tennis moves to clay courts for the next few months, one of the sport's greatest on the surface will be abscent for the first time in two decades. A clay-court swing without Rafael Nadal seemed implausible for so long, but now it has arrived.

In his absence, a cast of men's tennis characters will be looking to take up the mantle, while on the women's side, another clutch of players will be looking to topple the contemporary queen of clay, Iga Świątek.

Elsewhere, there's a return from a doping ban, a new umpiring system and much more to contend with. Here's what to look out for during the European clay-court swing.

The main character of the men's clay-court season will be someone other than Nadal for the first time in around two decades. He may not have won the French Open every year from 2005 onwards, but even when he didn't, the state of his game and body was always the main talking point. Before Nadal lost to Alexander Zverev in the first round of his final French Open last year, all anyone was talking about in April and May was how his body would hold up on the surface he had owned for the previous 19 years.

With Nadal retired, someone else has the opportunity to make the next couple of months their own. Maybe it will be Carlos Alcaraz, the reigning French Open champion, or one of the last two runners-up, Zverev and Casper Ruud. The world No. 1, Jannik Sinner, will surely fancy his chances when he returns to tennis at the Italian Open in May, with most of his rivals in various states of disrepair.

The most intriguing player in all this is Novak Djokovic, the man who suffered more than anyone from Nadal's absurd domination at Roland Garros. Djokovic is considered one of the greatest clay-courters of all-time, but his relationship with Roland Garros is one of frustration and disappointment. Three titles would be a dream-like haul for pretty much every other player, but for Djokovic, the tally would likely be far higher were it not for Nadal (and a red-lining Stan Wawrinka in 2015.)

Djokovic won his only title of 2024 at Roland Garros, beating Alcaraz in their titanic Olympic gold medal match. As he searches for his 25th Grand Slam title (and if he does not win a title before late May, his 100th overall), the red clay of Paris may be his best surface for success.

This is where it gets real for Świątek.

She has not won a tournament since last year's French Open. That includes a semifinal loss to Zheng Qinwen in the 2024 Paris Olympics on the red clay that she has ruled for three years. This season, she has come up short of her past successes on hard courts in February and March, relinquishing the Qatar Open title she had won three times in a row and losing to the eventual champion at the Australian Open and also at Indian Wells, where she was defending champion.

If similar dominoes fall on the red dirt, alarm bells might start going off. Whether they should or not is another question. Świątek was a point from the Australian Open final before Keys played three inspired points in a row; her loss to Alexandra Eala, the 19-year-old wild card from the Philippines who beat her in Miami, was the kind of one-off upset that any player can suffer.

Then there's the fact the ranking system means winning a tennis title one year becomes par the next year; if Świątek goes four for four at Roland Garros, or defends her titles at the Madrid and Rome Opens, she'll get no change in her gap to world No. 1 Sabalenka despite those being remarkable achievements.

“It's nice to learn from losses, but there are other things ahead,” she said after the loss to Eala. But then came a bit of a hedge.

“I'm happy that we're going to play on clay. I don't know how it's going to look like this year, but for sure I'll work hard to be ready.”

She will need to be ready, fair or not. The surface which spins her forehand highest and gives her the time to plow through opponents may also afford her the comfort to work on the elements of her game that she is changing, including her serve and her tendency, in some defeats, to descend into a flurry of wild groundstroke errors. The pressure of it being her favorite surface may have the opposite effect. Whatever happens, a few wins where a tennis player feels comfortable is usually a good place from which to build.

It might get worse for Zverev before it gets better.

After the Australian Open, he became the de facto world No. 1, with Sinner sidelined for his doping suspension. Zverev, last year's French Open finalist and Italian Open champion, headed to South America to play the Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro Opens, figuring he could clean up on points given his clay court prowess and make a play for the summit.

It hasn't worked out that way.

Zverev, an avid golfer, has been well below par since then. He's 6-6 since Australia. Worse, he doesn't seem to know what's wrong with his game.

He was 3-3 on the clay in South America, and the early events on clay in Europe haven't been kind to him historically. In a news conference in Miami, Zverev said the adjustment from hard courts to red clay takes some time for him. He returns from further back in the court. He puts a different shape on the ball; because of the change in bounce, he even adjusts his swing path.

As a result, Monte Carlo and Munich, both of which are sort of home tournaments for him, rarely go all that well. Madrid can be better. He won it in 2021 and made the final in 2022. By Rome, he's ready to roll, but the question this year is how his psyche will absorb any early losses after two months of falling short of his own expectations. There was a world where he could have snatched the No. 1 ranking from Sinner.

Right now, that's something of a fantasy world, as Zverev has been the first to admit. He did so once more after frittering a third-set lead to Arthur Fils in Miami.

“I have to look at myself more than anything else,” he said.

Sabalenka is in the enviable position of being world No. 1 but not having a great deal of pressure on her shoulders over the next couple of months.

She won't see it like that and will be desperate to win a first French Open title, but Świątek is the de facto No. 1 in this part of the year.

Sabalenka is so good and so absurdly consistent that there's no reason she can't have a great season on the clay and end it with a proper crack at winning at least a third title on the surface and perhaps a first major away from hard courts. She was a French Open semifinalist two years ago and would likely have repeated the feat in 2024 were it not for a bout of food poisoning that left her shaken against Mirra Andreeva in the quarterfinals. Before that, she reached the final in both Madrid and Rome, losing to Świątek on both occasions.

Sabalenka has also added tools to her game, particularly the slice and the drop shot, which are vital for success on the surface. Right now, she looks ready to capitalize on any wobble from her adversary, and in a sport in which timing is everything, she could spy an opportunity.

Maybe there will be some pressure on her after all.

Meanwhile, Sinner's form after his return from a three-month doping ban could decide the destination of this year's French Open title.

He will come back well-rested, but that's unlikely to be the key to his causing Alcaraz, Djokovic and co a problem in Paris. Even for the best player in the world, three months without elite-level competition is a long time, and he'll have just two tournaments — his home event in Rome and the Hamburg Open in Germany — to get match-tough for the French Open. For a player who has tended to struggle in the longest Grand Slam matches he has played, that may not be enough.

Off the court, he might be on the receiving end of some lingering frostiness in public and in private, but Sinner has, on numerous occasions, said he is used to blocking out external voices.

For the poor lost boys of men's tennis, the so-called “sandwich generation” born in the 1990s, it could be another rough couple of months.

Players born in the 2000s have dominated the start of 2025, with Sinner, Jack Draper and Jakub Menšík winning the three biggest titles, and things could be about to get worse for Stefanos Tsitsipas, Casper Ruud and Andrey Rublev in particular. They all have a lot of points to defend and none of them have been very consistent at the biggest events this season, despite all of them having 500-level titles or finals to their names in 2025.

Tsitsipas won the Monte Carlo Masters last year. Ruud lost to Tsitsipas in the final there and won the Barcelona Open, while Rublev won the Madrid Open. Ruud and Tsitsipas have semifinal and quarterfinal points to defend at the French Open, too. By the end of the clay-court season, all three could join Daniil Medvedev, another struggling member of their generation, in exiting the top 10.

The glass-half-full read on this is that Tsitsipas and Ruud are excellent clay-court players, so this period offers them the chance to rediscover their best level.

Twenty years ago, a 19-year-old who grew up on clay showed up at Roland Garros for the first time and walked away with the French Open title.

Strange as it may seem, Nadal was the favorite that year, with good reason. He'd won all three of the warm-up tournaments in Monte Carlo, Madrid and Rome.

No one is suggesting that's where Joao Fonseca of Brazil will be in six weeks. He is just 18 and he's probably not going to sweep the red-clay ATP 1,000s. If he does, he certainly will be the favorite heading into Roland Garros.

That said, Fonseca may have the X-factor for men's tennis this clay-court season. He won Buenos Aires, becoming the fourth-youngest man to win an ATP Tour title this century, and he's played more tennis on clay in his life than on any other surface. Fonseca has only just cracked the top 60, but there is widespread agreement that he's way better than his ranking right now. That makes him one of the most dangerous floaters in any draw, especially on a surface he knows well.

Maybe he's a year or two away from competing for these big titles in historic venues, but any player who sees Fonseca's name next to theirs on a draw sheet is going to immediately think they're not just facing a hot prospect, but also a future clay-court champion.

Świątek and Sabalenka are clearly the big favorites to win the big titles this clay-court season. So if not them, who else? And what does a good clay-court season even look like for a player in the next collection of contenders?

Starting with the players who cut against the stereotype of Americans being allergic to clay because they all played on it plenty growing up, Coco Gauff and Keys look well-placed. Gauff was 10 when she started spending time at the Mouratoglou Academy in the south of France. Keys and Stephens, both French Open finalists, spent their formative years at the Evert Academy in Florida. When it rained basically every afternoon, the green clay courts there dried out the fastest, so that's where they headed.

Emma Navarro grew up in Charleston, S.C., where there is plenty of green clay, including at the Charleston Open. She relishes physical three-set battles, which clay can often bring.

Jessica Pegula, the world No. 3, and a U.S. Open finalist in September, has not had a ton of success on clay, but said after her loss in the Miami final that she remains hopeful.

“I know I'm known more as a hard court player, but I think I can do well on the clay, too,” she said. “Hopefully, with some of those intangibles that I have added to my game, that can help me have a good clay season.”

She duly won this year's Charleston title, beating Sofia Kenin, another American French Open finalist of the past.

Gauff, the 2022 French Open finalist, is 11th in the race for the WTA Tour finals and still trying to find consistency with her serve and her forehand. Still, it's unlikely she and Keys will leave the European clay satisfied with anything less than making the final in one of the big events. If Pegula and Navarro are playing beyond the round of 16, they will feel like they've made progress.

Outside of the Americans, Zheng Qinwen, the 2024 Olympic champion who toppled Swiatek on the way to a gold medal at Roland Garros, has every right to believe she should be in the mix each week. She's based in Spain and her coach, Spaniard Pere Riba, knows his way around a clay court.

Likewise, Andreeva is expecting big things from herself. Her original breakthrough came on clay. She was a semifinalist in Paris last year. Can Jasmine Paolini get to another final? She believes she can. Elena Rybakina has beaten Świątek twice on clay, though one win came when Świątek retired with injury. She's looking to arrest her slide down the top 10.

It may prove that a late-round loss to Świątek or Sabalenka awaits some or all of these players. It will be gutting in the moment, but in hindsight, it might not look so bad. Keys lost to Świątek in the semifinals of the Madrid Open and the quarterfinals of the Italian Open last year. She then went to Strasbourg in France and won the title. In Paris, she fell to Navarro in the third round in two tiebreak sets, a loss that has also aged quite well.

MONTE CARLO, Monaco—It's been 20 years since Gael Monfils debuted at the Monte Carlo Masters, when he notably fell to fellow teenage sensation Rafael Nadal. When he arrives to play Roland Garros next month, the 38-year-old will also celebrate the 20-year anniversary of his first main-draw appearance there.Much has evolved over time, but there's one aspect of the two-decade journey that doesn't sit well with Monfils: Mother Nature.“The weather is worse and worse. Well, this is what I'm saying, because maybe summer arrives a lot later now. But honestly, it's not only here. The whole period on clay has changed,” the current world No. 44 told French press Monday.“I remember when the weather was really hot during those tournaments, and now we arrive here, the weather is bad. And the French Open, it's been a long time we didn't have two beautiful weeks. Every time, now I have the feeling it's cold in the French Open. I remember in Monte Carlo, so it was cold, it's been a long time. I haven't played here in Monte Carlo in the old way, with the beautiful weather.”

Despite Monday's nippy conditions, Monfils dug in to rally past Fabian Marozsan for a 4-6, 6-1, 6-1 victory. In assessing his performance, the fan favorite seemingly exceeded his own bar.“I really didn't expect to play as well as I did today. My contract is fulfilled. I won a match. I wanted to win more matches this year. Well, now I won one match out of one, so I think it's time for me to stop,” he laughed.“I did something I haven't been able to do for a long time, like moving around well, hitting well on both sides, and I served well. This helped me. I didn't panic after losing the first set, either.”

By advancing, Monfils lined up a second-round clash with Andrey Rublev. The seventh seed comes into the first Masters 1000 clay-court event of the year having added Marat Safin to his coaching team.“Mentally he was extremely solid. He really liked very tight matches, and he won many of them. So he has a great experience. This is what he can bring to Rublev,” believes Monfils about the two-time major winner.“I think also we'll discover what is happening little by little. It's a bit early maybe to talk about it. I think Marat has been coaching a top player for the first time this time, so it's like Andy [Murray] with Novak [Djokovic]. So it's difficult to tell right now. We need a few days, at least.”With his win over Marozsan, Monfils improved to 15-5 on the season. His lone clay-court title was his very first ATP tournament win, 20 years ago in Sopot, Poland. His most recent runner-up showing on red dirt came in Monte Carlo, nine years ago.

There's a new US No. 1 in town and she goes by the name Jessica Pegula.

The American tennis star has also dethroned Coco Gauff to officially become the new world No.3 after winning the Charleston Open.

Pegula's championship win was anything but straight forward. The 31-year-old had to mount a second-set fightback to beat Sofia Kenin 6-3, 7-5 on Saturday.

It was the first All-American final since 1990 and Pegula nearly had her first clay title slip away from her when she was down 5-1 in the second set.

However, the top seed saved three set points and won six games in a row against 2020 Australian Open champion Kenin to seal the victory. 

It is the latest victory following a string of strong performances from Pegula in recent weeks.

The American, who is the daughter of billionaire Buffalo Bills owner Terry Pegula, reached the Miami Open final last week.

"To be able to come here this week after a long two weeks in Miami and take the title is just incredible," said Pegula.

"In the second set, I just wanted to hold, I just wanted to tell myself to get momentum for the third, because coming into a third like that never feels good.

"I honestly didn't think I was going to break her twice, but luckily I could play some good tennis."

The new US No.1 was congratulated by her fellow American stars after she celebrated her Charleston Open success on social media.

“Maddie and I had a great week,” Pegula wrote on Instagram about her and her dog. “It's really special winning in a place that means so much to me.

“Charleston Open, you go above and beyond to make this tournament the best it can be – thank you for everything. I already can't wait for next year, Charleston.”

There were no hard feelings from Gauff, who posted a celebratory one-word message to Pegula despite her compatriot bumping her down the world rankings.

Gauff commented: “Congratulations,” while recent Australian Open champion Madison Keys commenting: “Goat s***".

Other tennis stars like Victoria Azarenka and Kim Clijsters also messaged Pegula, with the former writing: “Love that, congrats Jessie,” as the latter shared a handful of emojis.

Pegula has now won 17 of her last 19 matches, and with five victories this week, has 25 for the season.

This makes her the most in form player on the WTA Tour.

Pegula is also now the 10th American to win the home title in Charleston.

She joins Rosie Casals, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, Tracy Austin, Serena Williams, Venus Williams, Sloane Stephens, Madison Keys, and Danielle Collins as the other Americans to lift the title.

Meanwhile, Gauff, who has relinquished her title as the top ranked American player and drops to world No.4, has struggled on the tour this season.

The 21-year-old has had multiple early exits across several WTA tournaments since the Australian Open.

After a quarter-final defeat to Paula Badosa in Melbourne, the 21-year-old suffered further losses to Martha Kostyuk in Doha before losing to McCartney Kessler 6-4, 7-5 in Dubai.

Indian Wells and the Miami Open did not offer any reassurance to Guaff either as she was upset by Belinda Bencic and Magda Linette respectively.

Pegula's rise to become to the US No.1 will now set up a battle between her and Guaff on the WTA tour, with the pair separated by just 38 points in the rankings.

With next month's French Open hurtling up fast on the horizon, the 2025 Monte Carlo Masters gives men's tennis the chance to see who's showing the best form on the clay. This guide has everything you'll need to know in order to watch Monte Carlo Masters live streams, no matter where in the world you are.

After Rafa Nadal's decade of domination on the courts of the Monte Carlo Country Club, Stefanos Tsitsipas has stepped up to fill the void — the Greek adonis has won three of the last four editions, beating Casper Ruud in last year's final. That victory propelled him to a Roland-Garros quarter-final, but his form since has dipped and he's only managed to win a single match over the course of the last three Grand Slams.

With world No. 1 Jannik Sinner still sidelined through suspension, this year's Monte Carlo Masters couldn't be harder to call. Alexander Zverev and Carlos Alcaraz are the highest ranked players heading to the tournament (with Taylor Fritz out last-minute with an injury). British threat Jack Draper also recently won the prestigious Indian Wells Masters and is playing Monte Carlo. And that's before you even get to the GOAT, Novak Djokovic.

With men's elite tennis so gloriously unpredictable at present, you're going to want to know your options for watching Monte Carlo Masters live streams. Our dedicated guide has the instructions you need to watch the tennis in the US, UK, and beyond.

US: Tennis Channel

UK:

The Tennis Channel is the exclusive place to watch ATP Masters 1000 events like the Monte Carlo Masters in the US. The Tennis Channel is carried through a number of cable plans or, if you want to watch online, you can subscribe through its website for $10/month or $110/year. Alternatively, it's well-serviced by a variety of OTT streaming services.

Sling TV has long been a reasonably priced alternative to cable. To get access to the Tennis Channel, you first need to sign up for one of its base packages — check out our guide to Sling Orange vs. Blue to see which is a better match for your viewing habits. These generally cost $46/month, but a special offer means that you can currently get your first month for half that price. From there, you'll then need to add Sports Extra for an additional $11/month.


                          For just the essentials without any extra fluff, Sling TV is the streaming service you're looking for. It's more customizable than other plans, with three options you can choose from, so you pay for only what you need. New members often get a chunky discount on their first month.
                        
                      

DirecTV Stream costs more than Sling TV, but carries way more channels. The Tennis Channel appears on its Choice tier (and above) among 125+ other networks, which currently costs $115/month (with $25/month off for the first three months). It offers loads of flexibility on what you can add in terms of add-ons and connection devices, too.


                      DirecTV Stream carries all of the merits of the provider's Entertainment tier, plus access to regional and specialty sports networks. The MLB Network, NBA TV, and SEC Network are just some of the 125+ channels available with the plan.
                    

Sky Sports once again has the rights to show the Monte Carlo Masters in the UK. That means subscribers can also watch online and through their mobile thanks to the Sky Go app. If you don't want to sign up to a full blown Sky TV package, then you can opt for a more flexible Now Sports membership, which starts from as little as £15/day or costs £35 on a rolling monthly basis.

ATP Tour tennis tournaments — including this year's Monte Carlo Masters — can be watched on beIN Sports in Australia. Plans cost $15/month or $150/year, with a one-week free trial available either way for new users. You can watch through your web browser or via apps for iOS, Android, Samsung TVs, LG TVs, and AndroidTV. As well as the tennis, a subscription also gives you access to live streams of European club soccer from the likes of La Liga, Serie A, and the Bundesliga.

Although US- and UK-based tennis fans have to pay to watch this tournament, those in France get to catch some of the action absolutely free. One match per day (favoring French players) will be streamed for free on the france.tv platform — including the final!

You need to register an account to watch, which includes your name, date of birth and a postal code (the Eiffel Tower's, for example, is 75007). Once you've done that, you can watch france.tv streams live and on replay.

Try watching Monte Carlo Masters coverage from outside your country and you'll soon find that your normal feed is blocked. To get around this issue, you can use a virtual private network — or VPN. It's a clever tool that makes your laptop, smartphone, or other streaming device think it's in another country altogether, as well as giving you an extra level of online security.

ExpressVPN is among our very favorites. As per our ExpressVPN review, it's easy to use and is compatible with pretty much every device you can think of. Give it a try risk-free thanks to its 30-day money-back guarantee.


                      With its consistent performance, reliable security, and expansive global streaming features, ExpressVPN is the best VPN out there, excelling in every spec and offering many advanced features that make it exceptional. Better yet, you can save more than 60% right now and get up to four months free.

Alexander Zverev's recent drop in form is a “natural reaction” following his Australian Open final heartbreak, according to tennis great Mats Wilander.

The world No 2 started his year with a bang as he reached his third Grand Slam final, but he once again came up short as he was blown away by Jannik Sinner with the Italian winning 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3.

Many predicted Zverev would kick on after that, especially with Sinner's three-month ban starting at the beginning of February.

However, he went off the boil during the South American swing as he failed to make it past the quarter-finals at his three events while he fared even worse at the Sunshine Double as he lost in the second round at Indian Wells and the last 16 in Miami.

Seven-time Grand Slam winner Wilander says he is not too surprised that Zverev has struggled after his Melbourne defeat.

“Now that I watched him play, I do feel that he looks… I wouldn't say he is tired, but he looks a little bit like ‘Okay I kind of had enough at the moment' and I think it is a natural reaction,” he told Eurosport Germany.

“I can only speak from experience, once I lost a Grand Slam final, the difference between winning a Grand Slam in terms of confidence and losing a final is like night and day.

“You would think it wouldn't be that big a difference because you win six matches and you win seven matches [when you win the final].

“But to win six matches and lose in the final, it takes you two to three months before you figure out first of all ‘what the hell happened', second of all ‘I had my chances' or third, even worse ‘I didn't have my chances'.

“I think that's what Zverev is dealing with [as he might think] ‘I didn't actually have my chances in that match'. And that is feeling awful right now. Right now [Zverev is thinking] ‘I am not sure I think I can beat any player in the world'.

“So I think it's a natural dip in his form and I do think he is going to be back. He is too good a player, he works too hard. His confidence I think against normal players is too high for him to lose early.”

The clay-court season is now in full swing and Zverev has always been good on the surface. Last year he won the Italian Open and finished runner-up at Roland Garros.

Wilander feels it is only a matter of time before the world No 2 regains form.

The Swede added: “I think by the time Madrid comes around, which is one of his favourite tournaments on clay, I do think we are going to be talking about Sascha Zverev as one of the contenders at the French Open again.”

Zverev is a two-time champion at the Madrid Open, but he is confident he will return to form at this week's Monte Carlo Masters.

His best run at the tournament was in 2022 when he reached the semi-final while last year he lost in the third round.

“I lost a few matches I shouldn't have lost because I was always in the lead. But I played better recently in Miami and am now really looking forward to Monte Carlo,” the German said.

Zverev added on Eurosport. “I've won all the other Masters tournaments on clay and have reached the semifinals here twice. I hope I can play good tennis this week, and I believe I can win here too.”

Alexandra Eala's Miami Masters campaign was one for the record books.

The 19-year-old Filipina wildcard unexpectedly surged into the semifinals, becoming the first teenager to achieve this feat in Miami since Victoria Azarenka in 2009.

Eala upset Jelena Ostapenko, Madison Keys and Iga Swiatek throughout the tournament, becoming the second wildcard – alongside Elina Svitolina at Wimbledon 2023 – to defeat three Grand Slam champions at the same WTA event.

Australian doubles No.1 Ellen Perez, who hit with Eala in Miami, was like many surprised by her groundbreaking run, but perhaps less so in hindsight given what she'd seen from the rising star in practice.

“We hit the first day just before she played her first round of singles," Perez recounted on this week's episode of The Sit-Down podcast.

"We were doing a lot of cross-court shots; she wanted to work on her forehand and I was like, ‘Oh, this is fun' – because it's lefty forehand-to-forehand – and we were absolutely crushing it.

“I even have to toot my own horn; I was playing so well and we were absolutely smacking it for long rallies, and I turned to Rennae Stubbs and I'm like ‘damn, we're hitting [the ball] so well' and little did I know how well she was going to go [at the tournament]. 

"But I look back on that moment of us hitting and I think I could see it coming too.”

Eala and Perez share a mutual connection through former Portuguese player Maria Joao Koehler. 

Koehler served as Perez's coach between 2021 and 2022, and Eala was also coached by the former world No.102 at the Rafa Nadal Tennis Academy in Spain, where she graduated in 2023. Perez sometimes trains at the Manacor facility.

“She trained at the Rafa [Nadal] Academy and my coach Maria used to coach her. So as we were playing [ITF W25s and W60 tournaments], I hit with her quite a few times,” Perez explained. 

“She even asked to play doubles at one of the tournaments, and I said yes. In the end, her coach backed out, but we've hit maybe four or five times.

“After she beat Jelena [Ostapenko], I was just about to go on and play and I went over to congratulate her, and I took a photo to send it to Maria – because we do that every time I catch up with Alex. I'll take a photo with her, and I'll send it to Maria just as a ‘oh, we miss you' kind of thing.

“Then when it blew up that she was doing so well, I posted it [on X] just as like ‘If you're not on the bandwagon, you should be'.” 

Eala's Miami miracle proved that now is indeed the time to get on board and follow this ascendant Filipina star.

Arthur Fils will kick off his Monte-Carlo campaign against Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor, while fellow Frenchman Ugo Humbert takes on Aussie Alexei Popyrin. It's the continuation of first-round competition on Tuesday.

(12) Arthur Fils vs. Tallon Griekspoor

France's Arthur Fils is knocking at the door of the top 10, as the 20-year-old sits at a career-high of 15th in the world. He comes to European clay off a pair of quarterfinal results at the Indian Wells and Miami Masters events, having downed world No. 2 Alexander Zverev a couple of weeks ago. Fils has a good all-surface game, with two clay-court titles and one hard-court crown on his resume so far. He is also very popular in France and will have vocal support at the Monte-Carlo Country Club this week.

Tallon Griekspoor just made a clay final in Marrakech last week, but it was a bit of depleted draw. He beat nobody inside the top 70 en route to the title match against world No. 57 Luciano Darderi. In addition to possible fatigue for Griekspoor from playing a final just a few days ago, Fils is in excellent form right now and he will be playing with the crowd on his side.

Look for a tidy win from Fils to advance to the second round.

Alexei Popyrin vs. Ugo Humbert

Like Fils, Ugo Humbert will be playing in front of a “home” crowd–but unlike the youngster, the world No. 20 often flies under the radar. Well, there's also the fact that clay is Humbert's worst surface by some margin. He has a miserable 14-30 ATP-level record on the dirt and has never won a clay-court title. He does usually play well in front of an appreciative crowd, but the courts in Monte-Carlo are as classically clay as they get.

Alexei Popyrin has endured a terrible start to the season. The Aussie has played seven tournaments with just two wins to show for his efforts. He is comfortable on the clay moreso than his opponent, but whether a change in surface can make up for his dismal form remains to be seen. He has played Humbert twice before; they split the wins at one each, but Popyrin won their only clay-court encounter.

The crowd should give Humbert the edge he needs to advance.

Bortoleto concedes ‘tricky' start cost him in Japan while Hulkenberg reflects on ‘frustrating' Suzuka outing

Mercedes' Fred Vesti, Aston Martin's Felipe Drugovich and Williams' Luke Browning will drive in Free Practice 1 (FP1) at the Bahrain Grand Prix, replacing George Russell, Fernando Alonso and Carlos Sainz.

The trio  will get behind the wheel as part of the rules that state every driver on the grid must vacate their seat for a rookie for two FP1 sessions in a season.

READ MORE: Antonelli hails ‘boost of confidence' in Suzuka after ‘mentally tough' weekend

A rookie is classed as a driver who has started two or fewer Grands Prix, with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli technically already fulfilling this requirement for the season having completed his two sessions for 2025 in Australia and China.

Vesti – the runner-up in the 2023 F2 Championship – will be making his third FP1 appearance, having previously driven for the Silver Arrows in Mexico and Abu Dhabi back in 2023.

Vesti was runner-up in the 2023 F2 Championship

As part of his role as Test and Reserve Driver, Vesti has spent the first part of this year working in the simulator at Mercedes' base in Brackley, combining his role with his first season in endurance racing in the United States, where he is competing in IMSA with Cadillac.

“I am really looking forward to getting my first taste of the W16 in FP1 in Bahrain," Vesti said. “Being able to put all of my simulator work into practice on the track is a really exciting prospect for me.

“At the start of the year, I set myself the goal of maximising every chance I get behind the wheel of an F1 car in 2025, and that is what I hope to achieve in Bahrain.

“I will be doing everything I can to help the team, George, and Kimi get set for the rest of the weekend. I am grateful to Mercedes for once again giving me this opportunity.”

Aston Martin's Test and Reserve Driver Drugovich – the 2022 F2 Champion – will also embark on his latest session in F1 at a track he knows well, having previously stood in for an injured Lance Stroll during 2023 pre-season testing at the same venue.

Drugovich drove in the 2024 end-of-season test for Aston Martin

The 24-year-old Brazilian has also taken part in three end-of-season tests for Aston Martin previously, as well as five FP1 sessions at race weekends.

"I'm very happy to be getting out in the F1 car again, especially so early in the season," he said. "I've been preparing on the simulator to get a feel for the car, and Bahrain is a track I know well and really enjoy driving.

"I'm excited to contribute and give the team the data they need to perform at their best this weekend. Thanks to the whole team for their continued support."

Andy Cowell, Aston Martin's CEO and Team Principal, said: "We're pleased to offer Felipe this opportunity to drive the AMR25 in Bahrain. He has been an integral part of our team's simulator programme at the AMR Technology Campus and consistently provides valuable and insightful feedback that helps drive the development of the car.

"Felipe is a trusted pair of hands, and we're confident he'll do a great job in FP1 and contribute to our preparations for the race weekend."

Meanwhile, Williams Racing Academy Driver Browning, who is currently in his first full F2 season with Hitech GP, will make his second FP1 appearance after turning out for the Grove-based outfit in the first practice session over the 2024 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix weekend.

Luke Browning will take over Carlos Sainz's Williams in Fp1 in Bahrain

The 23-year-old Briton said: “Being given another opportunity to drive in a Free Practice session with Williams is a dream come true, and I'm getting more and more confidence each time I drive the car. My main aim for FP1 is to get more comfortable with the procedures and environment that come with Formula 1, and to build on my experience from Abu Dhabi last December.

"I'm excited to feel the progression from the FW46 to the FW47 and I feel incredibly grateful to James [Vowles], Sven [Smeets] and the team at Grove for entrusting me with the car. A lot of preparation has gone into this weekend, so thank you to everyone in the Driver Academy for supporting my development so far.”

Sven Smeets, Williams' Sporting Director, added: “Luke has made strong progress since his first Formula 2 weekend last year and scored good points in the opening race of the season in Australia.

"His previous FP1 experience, participation in our TPC programme, and simulator work have prepared him well for this weekend and we look forward to seeing him take this next step forward in his development.”

Earlier this week it was also confirmed that Ryo Hirakawa would drive in FP1 in Bahrain for Haas, taking over Ollie Bearman's VF-25 machine.

POWER RANKINGS: Who dazzled our judges with a perfect performance during the Japanese GP?

Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto and Nico Hulkenberg were left to reflect on a frustrating Japanese Grand Prix as neither driver was able to make much progress in the race, the Brazilian rookie coming home in P19 while the German took P16.

Bortoleto's race got off to the worst possible start when he picked up wheelspin off the line on what looked a slightly greasy portion of the track following earlier rain. Starting on the hard compound tyres did not help the rookie, as three cars shot past him right from the off.

READ MORE: Leclerc admits Ferrari have ‘got to work' on performance after P4 in Japan as Hamilton reflects on ‘lonely race' to P7

They included Haas' Esteban Ocon – who was also on the hard tyre – and Alpine's Jack Doohan and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll on the softs. Bortoleto only managed to make it back in front of Stroll across the race, enduring lap after lap stuck behind Ocon.

“The start was a bit tricky, I didn't have the best start ever," Bortoleto explained after the race. "There were two soft tyres behind us so already we expect them to overtake.

Bortoleto found himself stuck behind Ocon for much of the race in Japan 

“But anyways, Ocon was in the same strategy as me and he managed to… he had a better pull away at the start and overtook me, and I got stuck behind him the whole race. I think I was faster through the whole race honestly. It was just not enough pace advantage to overtake."

One thing all the rookies are continuing to do is learn – about their cars, the tyres, how to extract the best from their set-ups and how to fight wheel-to-wheel with their rivals. Bortoleto is no different, as he continues to adjust to life as an F1 driver.

“I'm leaving Suzuka satisfied with how the weekend unfolded,” he added. “I have learned a lot – it's been a steady learning curve since Melbourne, and I am feeling more in control with each session. I want to thank the team both trackside and back at base.”

Hulkenberg could not find a way to overtake as he came home 16th at Suzuka 

As for Hulkenberg, the German was another who could not make much progress through the field on Sunday. He was on the same medium-hard tyre strategy as the majority of the field, and came home behind the Alpine of Doohan.

“The car didn't feel too bad today, and I would have liked the chance to explore its full potential a bit more,” Hulkenberg said afterwards. "But Suzuka is a track where overtaking is notoriously difficult, and that really defined the race.

“I spent most of the time in traffic, which made it hard to make any real progress and ultimately turned it into a fairly uneventful race. That's obviously a bit frustrating.

“We know there's still work to do – both in terms of overall pace and car characteristics – and today's race underlined that once again. It‘s still early in the season and we continue to learn with every race weekend.”

EXCLUSIVE: Even as Denis Villeneuve puts the finishing touches on the script for the next installment in the Dune franchise, the director already has his sights set on a new addition to the all-star ensemble. While sources close to the project say no formal offer has been presented, Deadline is hearing there is strong interest in Robert Pattinson joining the cast. Legendary had no comment.


	The film already features an A-list ensemble that includes Timothée Chalamet, Florence Pugh and Zendaya, and many are expected to return. Even so, a handful of new roles remain and, as with any Dune project, stars are lining up at the chance to appear in the Oscar-winning franchise.

	











	While confirmed, sources say Pattinson would play the villain role of Scytale.

	As Deadline previously reported, the plan is to shoot the film this summer. Villeneuve is returning to direct.


Dune is Legendary's expansive, multi-format science fiction universe based on Frank Herbert's Hugo Award-winning novel series. The collection has included two feature films (2021's Dune: Part One and last year's Dune: Part Two, which earned a combined $1.12 billion at the global box office and won eight Oscars from 15 nominations, including Best Picture noms for both. The universe's most recent entry is prequel TV series Dune: Prophecy, from Lost writer-producer Alison Schapker and set 10,000 years before the ascension of Paul Atreides. The series premiered on HBO and Max in November to critical acclaim.


	As for Pattinson, The Batman star has been busy, recently wrapping A24 film The Drama, which also stars his Dune co-star Zendaya, as well as the Lynne Ramsay film Die, My Love in which he stars opposite Jennifer Lawrence. He is currently filming Christopher Nolan's adaptation of The Odyssey. He is also producing the A24 film Primetime.


	Pattinson is repped by WME, 3 Arts Entertainment, Curtis Brown Group and attorney Robert Offer.

For a show that can't escape the term “prescient,” it's fitting that one critic knew exactly what would doom “The Handmaid's Tale” before anyone else even knew it was doomed. Not me, of course. I would never claim such credit even if I deserved it. But in her 2017 review of the first season, New Yorker critic Emily Nussbaum (who won the Pulitzer Prize just a year earlier) framed her critique in the sturdy housing of history. 

She starts off noting the adaptation's “grotesque timeliness,” arriving just a few months into Trump's first term, while also noting how many other critics have noted the same thing. So she shifts gears, appraising the American landscape that received Margaret Atwood's esteemed book: “Just a decade earlier,” Nussbaum writes, “a woman could be denied a credit card without a man to co-sign, and yet, by 1985, when the novel was written, the media was declaring that feminism was over, dunzo, defunct — no longer necessary, now that women wore sneakers to jobs at law firms.”

The timely parallels and contradictions Nussbaum describes are much like the traits she admires in Atwood's novel. There, Offred is an observer. A witness. She's chronicling her experience as a means to preserve her sanity in a place designed to strip it away. Whatever hope Offred has for the future isn't for her to experience.

But in the show, as Nussbaum notes, Offred's not just Offred; she's June. She's not just surviving; she's fighting back. She's not a witness; she's a heroine. Instead of acting as a passive participant in history, June — and “The Handmaid's Tale” — are actively engaged with changing history. 

This tonal shift may not feel as drastic as some of showrunner Bruce Miller's narrative alterations, but time has proven it carried the most consequence. Atwood's novel allows readers to map June's hardship onto virtually any era in which women feel oppressed (which, horrifically, is every era in American history). June's perspective and its near-future setting make the book timeless.

But Hulu‘s “The Handmaid's Tale” is not timeless. It, like its protagonist, is firmly rooted in this moment, this era, and this portion of history — for better or, lately, for worse.

At the outset, the show felt like an unwanted yet undeniable reflection of reality. As much as viewers would prefer to see less of their lives in their dystopian TV dramas, having a searing, widely available example of what it was like to be alive in 2017 functioned like a rallying cry. Hell, it was a rallying cry. But movements change, protests choose new names, and signs are rewritten. Wearing a handmaid's blood-red robes wouldn't mean the same thing for the Hands Off March as it did for the Women's March. (And the intended meaning didn't even last beyond the first year of Women's Marches.)

 










But the prescience was always an accident. A scripted TV show, which takes months (sometimes years) to plan and produce, can't possibly keep pace with current events, let alone predict them, and making June an inspirational figure put the “The Handmaid's Tale” on, as Nussbaum feared, a predictable progression. First, she would survive Gilead. Then, she would escape Gilead. Then, she would defeat Gilead. And when Gilead represents American misogyny, that's a tall order when it comes to reflecting the real world.

In a way, the series was doomed if it leaned into its topical designations and doomed if it didn't. Once the first season took off the way it did — in the ratings, in the culture, in the awards realm — there was no putting the genie back in the bottle. By then (to borrow a phrase from another insightful science-fiction series), resistance was futile. 

Now, the end is nigh. After the first season's thunderous debut, “The Handmaid's Tale” has been in steady decline. Critical favor dropped off by the third season. The Emmys, known for lingering on shows long past their primes, bailed in Season 5. The final season premiered today, as I write this, and, in the admittedly subjective and secretive arena of TV popularity, the only notable peeps have come from critics, the cast, and hangers-on. This is not the triumphant, obsessed-over exit given to Elisabeth Moss‘ other awards darling, “Mad Men.”  

 










That's not to say the series can't close out its run respectably. I don't know how “The Handmaid's Tale” ends, since Hulu only provided eight of the final 10 episodes for review. But so far, it's barely deviating from the repetitious story arcs it's cycled through over the last three seasons, intent on sticking to whatever path it's set up for itself long, long ago. 

June (Moss) begins Season 6 on a train from Toronto to Vancouver. She's been turned away by a Canadian government growing increasingly hostile toward Gilead refugees, and Gilead's interest in removing her has only intensified. She carries her second daughter, Nichole (still an infant), and she hopes to reunite with her husband, Luke (O-T Fagbenle), once his own legal issues are settled. Then, they can finally be free. They can finally flee to one of the two remaining U.S. states. They can leave their wretched pasts behind, in Gilead, where wretchedness goes to thrive. 

But waiting on her train, like a living reminder of what June knows she'll never forget, is Serena Joy (Yvonne Strahovski). She, too, is fleeing Toronto, where she was abandoned by her former friends in Gilead. She, too, carries a baby in her arms, having stolen her child back from adoptive parents assigned by the state. She, too, hopes to find a family and freedom at the end of the line. 

 










June doesn't see these similarities. Or, perhaps she does, but she's loathe to admit there's any truth in them. “The enemy of my enemy is my friend,” Serena says to June. “On a case by case basis,” June spits back. Their ensuing dance — between peace and animosity, the bond of motherhood and the betrayal of opposing beliefs — remains a focal point for “The Handmaid's Tale,” buoyed by each performer's well-built convictions if lacking in the raw power felt when the Commander's wife was still ordering around her handmaid. Serena's journey in Season 5 pulls her closer to June's point of view than she ever expected, and June's experiences are colored by a growing empathy brought out in her by the woman she once loathed more than anyone else.  

They're fitting arcs, albeit familiar ones. Perhaps June and Serena navigating a future that's so out of whack with what they expected 10 years, five years, or even a few months prior would be more compelling if they weren't plotting out courses they've already tried. June resumes her rebel ways. Serena finds comfort in the arms of a new Commander (Josh Charles). As the world around them shifts toward accepting Gilead as a sovereign state — thanks in no small part to the continued reforms of its repentant founder, Commander Lawrence (Bradley Whitford, still great) — June and Serena just keep repeating themselves, hoping for a different result. 

 










In practice, it's like “The Handmaid's Tale” is stalling for time. Anyone curious how it ends needn't catch up on past seasons or even sit through all of this one; just tune in for the final two episodes next month, and trust the “previously on” recaps will tell you everything you need to know. But those expecting a definitive ending probably shouldn't. Atwood's sequel to “The Handmaid's Tale” is already in production. “The Testaments” takes place just 15 years after the end of the original book, and Gilead is chugging along just fine. Whatever righteous coup June imagined achieving in the past seems unlikely to transpire.  

But June has to win something, somehow. That's the ending “The Handmaid's Tale” is built for, and that's the one producers are promising to deliver. It would also, rather decisively, break from the series' penchant for real-world parallels. We're not even three months into Trump's second term, and imagining a path to victory, virtuous or otherwise, feels next to impossible. Too much damage has already been done and too many lives have already been ruined to pretend America can emerge triumphant. But June can. Maybe the final message will be one of finding individual fulfillment, through small communities, fighting against an authoritarian regime. It wouldn't fix a wayward final season, but maybe it could work. And maybe that small ray of hope would resonant even more than all that relatable darkness.

 










If so, perhaps “doomed” is too strong a forecast. After all, Nussbaum's original review was positive (the headline even uses the term “cunning”), and she allowed for the chance, as any sage critic should, that her assumptions about where the show would wind up could be wrong. “[The show] might succeed,” she wrote. But by pivoting onto a “conventional path” it still lost something irretrievable: The book ends with a “brilliantly dark punchline: Offred's future reader turns out to be a smug know-it-all, a future professor of Gileadean studies, who deconstructs her like a bug. Her desperate message was received, but misunderstood, because the future inevitably imagines itself superior to the past.”

The show can't end that way, and not only because it moved past Atwood's story by the end of Season 1: An ending like that, which respects time's inherent repetitions, doesn't fit an inspirational saga of perseverance, freedom, and victory. It would be a reflective conclusion for a show devoted to progress; an ending that looks back when it's always looking forward. What Nussbaum calls “the special beauty of a bleak ending” belongs to the novel. “But it can't happen here.” 

Such a shame. An ending like that would be all too fitting.

“The Handmaid's Tale” premieres Tuesday, April 8 on Hulu with three episodes. New episodes will be released weekly through the series finale on Tuesday, May 27.

Whether it's a short-run or year-round channel, the satellite dial can be a place to more deeply connect with fans while promoting a new release or diving into a catalog.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



Back before satellite radio launched at the turn of the millennium, the best an artist could hope for was that their label's radio team could help get their songs on playlists at as many terrestrial stations as possible, as often as possible.


	But following the launch of the XM and Sirius satellite radio services in 2001 and 2002, respectively, a new paradigm emerged that allowed artists the possibility of hosting their own bespoke channels — on which they could play their hits and deep cuts, as well as songs by their influences, while chatting up their latest releases.


	The new format kicked off, naturally, with Elvis Radio in 2004 on Sirius. That was followed by Sirius' first artist pop-up channel, the Bruce Springsteen-focused E Street Radio, in November 2005, which ultimately went full-time in 2007 and continues to this day.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The trend continued following the 2008 merger of the Sirius and XM satellite services. Since then, SiriusXM has hosted full-time channels by big-name artists including Kenny Chesney, Willie Nelson, Kelly Clarkson, Taylor Swift, Pitbull, Eminem, Bob Marley, Diplo, The Beatles, Jimmy Buffett, Grateful Dead, Phish, Frank Sinatra and dozens of others. The service has also collaborated with artists including Green Day, Beastie Boys, Jonas Brothers, Metallica, Linkin Park, Luke Bryan, Coldplay, Usher and Billie Eilish on shorter-run pop-up stations.


	So why have artists flocked to the service to claim their own spots on the satellite dial?


	For some, having their own SiriusXM channel can serve as a valuable promotional vehicle for a forthcoming release. Lady Gaga, who had a short-run “Gaga Radio” channel in February ahead of her blockbuster Mayhem album, tells Billboard it was “a reflection of the sounds that shaped Mayhem, the artists who move and inspire me, and the emotional connection I share with my fans,” adding that “every song you hear was handpicked — not by an algorithm, but by me.”


Marcus Mumford — whose band Mumford & Sons is the newest act to have a short-run channel, tied to the release of its new album Rushmere — says his group “leapt” at the chance to celebrate their music and look back at their catalog, live performances and collaborations over the years. “As artists now we can't show up expecting to get people's attention… there's less gatekeeping, which is a good thing, so you really have to put in the work,” he tells Billboard. While taking extra time to sit with SiriusXM staffers to record the stories behind the band's songs and curate the channel during the rush of Rushmere promotional duties, was, in his words, “not ideal,” he says the group was up for the hard work it takes. “We love going where people are,” he says.


	“The feedback we get labels or artists when they do these pop-up channels has been really outstanding, so I think there are other aspects beyond increasing consumption numbers,” says SiriusXM head of music Steve Blatter when asked if there's specific market data he can point to that illustrates a Colbert-like “SiriusXM bump” for either the long-running or time-limited channels (he notes that the company does not share any details on the financial arrangements for its artist channels).


	For other artists, particularly those who have year-round stations on the satellite service, it's less about promoting a project than about promoting a catalog, or even a culture. When LL Cool J launched his year-round Rock the Bells Radio channel in 2018, he wasn't interested in just putting his name on a channel — he wanted to preserve and elevate timeless hip-hop. “[I] personally went through thousands of tracks to shape something real for the culture,” he says. “Every song, every interview, every moment you hear is chosen with intention.”


Tom Petty‘s daughter, Adria Petty, says that when her dad heard Bob Dylan doing his “Theme Time Radio Hour” shows on SiriusXM's Deep Tracks channel from 2006 to 2009 — on which the rock bard told rambling stories and played songs around a particular theme — it led him to approach SiriusXM about starting his own channel, realizing the free format would allow him to do something other than talk about his music and lyrics, which “he found to be a hassle,” she says.


	While Petty was alive, the channel also gave Petty's fellow Heartbreakers band members the chance to come on and do their own shows and play deep cuts, live tracks and rarities. “It was that idea that DJs are people who create and curate culture and have fun in communion with people,” says Adria, adding that before her father died in 2017 at age 66, he told her the channel was a crucial part of his legacy.


	Today, Adria says the channel not only heightens her dad's catalog consumption but functions as the “heart and soul” of the estate. The 24-hour channel's constant presence on the virtual dial impacts the catalog “in a big way,” she says, because there's a whole team dedicated to programming it, which can help promote re-issues and archival releases.


	“When you have an artist produce their channel in the manner we do, it's not just about spinning their music, but about shaping a culture and cultivating the artist's fan community and really presenting their legacy in a way that's very authentic and credible to that artist,” says Blatter. Since Carrie Underwood's year-round Carrie's Country channel launched in 2023, it's been an “amazing avenue” for the country star to connect with her fans, says her manager, The HQ's Ann Edelblute, who adds that connection “is extremely important to her and the reason she signed on.” Since the launch of Carrie's Country, the superstar has launched two additional streaming-only channels: Carr-dio by Carrie, featuring the country star's workout picks; and Savior Sunday Daily, which has a mix of uplifting faith-based country and gospel.


	“Both [of the additional channels] allow her to go deeper into areas that she and the fans love,” says Edelblute. “The three channels are a great creative outlet for her as well, as she regularly curates new playlists and loves being able to create new content and special programming year-round.”


	Not everyone can have a year-round channel, however. Satellite-distributed services such as SiriusXM have a limited bandwidth to work with, says Blatter, so there's a fixed number of channels they can offer; any time they add a new channel, they have to drop something else. “I'd love to offer a lot more artists their own year-round channels, but it's challenging to do so…so the bar to get your own year-round channel becomes fairly high,” he says. Another key factor in who gets a spot is whether an artist's body of work can hold up to being a year-round draw, according to Blatter. This can include legacy acts like the Dave Matthews Band, Pearl Jam, Springsteen, Grateful Dead and Phish as well as contemporary artists such as Eilish and Lizzo.


	As for audience size, Blatter says even the artist channels with the smallest audiences are well-trafficked, though he declined to provide any hard numbers. (A spokesperson for SiriusXM says the company does not publicly share listenership data.)


	At this point, SiriusXM has 46 year-round artist partner channels, though a few legendary acts with deep catalogs such as Michael Jackson, Prince, Dolly Parton and Beyoncé are noticeably absent from the permanent lineup (though all except Beyoncé have had limited-run channels in the past). Blatter says he'd love to expand the company's relationship with any of those artists (or artist estates) into something bigger, noting that sometimes it's the talent's choice to only commit to a short-run channel to promote an album release or documentary.


	Sometimes it comes down to resources and the artist only wanting to have a presence during a specific promotional window. Or, in the case of a somewhat niche act like Trans-Siberian Orchestra, realizing that interest will peak during the Christmas holiday and then likely drop off shortly after, making a quick hit channel more realistic.


	For Mumford, having a SiriusXM channel is a way to engage with fans on a deeper level amid a surge in short-form content that perhaps underestimates audiences' attention spans. “A lot of your publicity has to be shortened into snippets… yet people's capacity and attention is greater than ever — they'll sit and watch 10 hours of a Netflix show,” he says. “I think people want to hear stories in whatever form they come… it felt like a wider palette to paint with.”

Billboard's Hot Latin Songs sub-genre charts (dated April 12, 2025) have arrived, spotlighting a variety of format stars across the four new rankings.


	The surveys — Hot Regional Mexican Songs, Hot Latin Pop Songs, Hot Latin Rhythm Songs and Hot Tropical Songs — celebrate the accomplishments of Latin artists based on the same multimetric methodology (official U.S. audio and video streaming, radio airplay and sales) used for the pan-genre Hot Latin Songs chart and the all-genre Billboard Hot 100, with data provided by Luminate.

	











Bad Bunny doubles up, dominating Hot Latin Rhythm Songs with “DTMF” and Hot Tropical Songs with “Baile Inolvidable.” Selena Gomez, Benny Blanco and The Marías join forces to rule Hot Latin Pop Songs with “Ojos Tristes,” and Fuerza Regida and Grupo Frontera claim the top spot on Hot Regional Mexican Songs with “Me Jalo.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Here's a deeper look at the four charts' first leaders, which, notably, take the top four spots on Hot Latin Songs.


	Bad Bunny's “DTMF” is No. 1 on the Hot Latin Rhythm Songs chart with 9.6 million official U.S. streams from March 28 to April 3. On the radio front, the song drew 5.4 million audience impressions — up 18% week-over-week.


	“DTMF” also tops the Hot Latin Songs chart for a 12th week, having become the superstar's sweet 16th No. 1. It's his sixth song to reign for at least a dozen weeks.


	Benito's “Baile Inolvidable,” meanwhile, tops the first Hot Tropical Songs chart, with 8.3 million streams and 6.1 million in radio reach. The track ranks at No. 4 on Hot Latin Songs, after previously reaching No. 2 on the chart.


	Selena Gomez, Benny Blanco and The Marías' “Ojos Tristes” crowns Hot Latin Pop Songs fueled by strong streaming and airplay gains. The track, a modern reinterpretation of Jeanette's British-Spanish classic “El Muchacho De Los Ojos Tristes,” drew 8.7 million U.S. official streams, up 5%. It's also beginning on radio, with 506,000 in audience.


	“Ojos Tristes” ascends from No. 4 to No. 3 in its second week on Hot Latin Songs.


	Fuerza Regida and Grupo Frontera's “Me Jalo” starts atop the Hot Regional Mexican Songs chart, just one week after simultaneously leading both the Latin Airplay and Regional Mexican Airplay charts. The collab collected 8.1 million streams and 7.5 million in radio audience over the last week. It rises 3-2 for a new high on Hot Latin Songs.

Rubby Pérez has been hospitalized following the deadly roof collapse at the Jet Set nightclub in the Dominican Republic, where he was performing early on Tuesday (April 8).


	The 69-year-old Dominican merengue singer — known for Billboard hits such as “Tu Vas a Volar,” “Enamorado de Ella” and “15,500 Noches” in collaboration with Romeo Santos, Toño Rosario, Fernandito Villalona and Raman Orlando — has been transferred to the Plaza de la Salud hospital, according to medical director Nepomuceno Mejia. 

	











	“He's hospitalized, he's inside, and we hope to God that he recovers soon,” the singer's daughter, Zulinka Pérez, told local news outlets. “He's injured, but he's hospitalized; they found him singing. He started singing so they could hear him. He's always told me: ‘If something ever happens to me, cover me so no one takes pictures.'”

	Zulinka, who's also a backup singer for Pérez and was present when the roof collapsed, shared: “I'm his backup singe — my husband and I are backup singers. My husband covered me, threw himself on top of me, and he got trapped. He told me, ‘Get out quickly.' The musicians were able to get out; the bass player is in critical condition; I think he had surgery in the hospital. And one of the saxophone players is dead.” 


	The roof collapse left nearly 50 dead and over 150 injured, according to multiple reports. A cause for the roof's collapse is not yet known.


	On Valentine's Day, Pérez released his latest single, “No Voy a Llorar,” and announced a few shows in the U.S. kicking off in May, including one slated for July 18 at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Hollywood, Fla.

Senior Editor, Latin


	The roof of the renowned Jet Set nightclub in the Dominican Republic collapsed early Tuesday (April 8), killing dozens and injuring more than 100 attendees, according to local authorities. The deadly incident occurred during a Rubby Pérez live performance, where more than 300 people gathered to see the merengue singer perform.


	Located in Santo Domingo's National District, the beloved live music venue — a go-to destination for locals and tourists alike — was celebrating its 50th anniversary, according to its Instagram account. “Dominican discotheque in charge of making its audience dance for more than 50 years,” an official description reads.

	











	Hours after the collapse, the nightclub posted its statement: “Last night a tragedy occurred that has deeply touched the hearts of all of us at Jet Set and all Dominicans. At this difficult time, our prayers are with each of the families affected. We share their pain as if it were our own, because we are also in mourning. We are collaborating fully and transparently with the competent authorities to help the victims and clarify what happened. The loss of human lives leaves us in a state of deep pain and consternation. We join the expressions of solidarity from all over the country in this unexpectedly painful situation.”

	According to Enrique Paulino, Pérez's manager, who spoke to reporters at the scene, the roof collapsed about an hour after the show's midnight start time. The singer was transferred to the Plaza de la Salud Hospital, according to medical director Nepomuceno Mejía. Pérez's saxophone player was killed in the incident, according to Paulino. It's not clear what caused the roof to collapse.


	Below are fo ur things to know about the emblematic Jet Set nightclub.


	Right in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, the nightclub was located in the city's National District, which hosts various nightlife activities, including chic discotheques, hotels and upscale restaurants and bars. 


	Powerhouses such as Los Hermanos Rosario, Sergio Vargas, Omega and Fernando Villalon, to name a few, had performed at the Jet Set. Notably, El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico performed there for the first time in 2008, in celebration of the nightclub's 35th anniversary. Mondays were particularly busy for the live music venue.

	











Billboard Español contributor Franchesca Guim, who is from the Dominican Republic but is currently based in Spain, shares the importance of Jet Set. “The Jet Set has been part of the nightlife culture and entertainment in Santo Domingo. I would dare to say that it is a place of reference in the Dominican Republic, where locals and tourists attend to enjoy live orchestras,” she explains. “Christmas and New Year's parties have been memorable, and part of the Dominican tradition. Any week lends itself to go to the Jet Set, because there is always a good atmosphere and above all live orchestras and music. My mom remembers that Jet Set Mondays became a tradition. Every Monday there was a party with a live orchestra.”


	Owned by businessman Antonio Espaillat, the Jet Set Club had a capacity of 700 seated and 1,000 standing room only. According to local reports, it had been remodeled several times to update its dance floor, ambiance, lights and sound. It is reported that in 2015 it underwent its last remodeling. In 2023, a fire affected the facilities after lightning struck its power plant.

	Across the federal government, Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has gained access to untold volumes of data containing the personal information of hundreds of millions of Americans. The data includes information like addresses, tax filings, family members, and medical records for everyone from average citizens receiving Social Security benefits, to millions of current and past federal employees, and applicants for government jobs, as well as judges who hear disputes between government agencies, companies, and everyday Americans.


	Exactly what DOGE is doing with all this data seems to be an open question, according to court filings reviewed by Rolling Stone and American Doom. Those filings show that lawyers representing Donald Trump's administration have failed to explain why DOGE needs the data. And even the simple fact that DOGE has access to this data appears to represent a blatant and widespread violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, according to plaintiffs in a slew of lawsuits directed at DOGE's work inside the government. 

	











	The lawsuits — and DOGE's access to reams of data at agencies like the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Treasury Department, and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) — have prompted federal judges to issue restraining orders prohibiting DOGE from continuing to access the data. In Maryland, U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman recently ordered that DOGE stop accessing data at the Treasury Department, saying it was likely a violation of the Privacy Act. Also in Maryland, another federal judge, Ellen Lipton Hollander, ordered DOGE to stop accessing data at the SSA that has provided Musk's organization with the personal information of every single person in the country who possesses a Social Security number. DOGE has access not just to every U.S. citizen's personal information thanks to the SSA data, but also anyone who has applied for or been granted Social Security numbers, like legal immigrants, according to court documents reviewed by Rolling Stone and American Doom.

	In both cases, unions representing workers have sued the agencies, alleging that DOGE's access to the personal information of union members contained in government datasets violates the Privacy Act. The law — created in the wake of Watergate to prevent the abuse of data held by government agencies, like former President Richard Nixon's attempts to punish political enemies by blackmailing them with IRS tax information — is at the center not just of the Maryland lawsuits, but several more in which unions and other organizations are suing the government over DOGE's information gathering. 

	











	“It goes back to why the Privacy Act exists in the first place — to prevent someone in the government like the president from accessing data to create an enemies list or effectuate a mass firing of employees who aren't loyal,” says Rhett Millsaps of Lex Lumina, a law firm that is representing several groups in their lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against OPM over DOGE's access to agency data. “It's not just about information that's shared outside of the agency, the Privacy Act even restricts within an agency who can access the data to those who need to know.”


	That's why, Millsaps said, it doesn't matter if DOGE employees are technically working for DOGE or are named employees of the agency itself, as is the case with two DOGE staffers who were recently named to staff positions at the SSA. Even agency staff must comply with the Privacy Act's stipulations that data is accessed only for the purposes it was collected, or other specific purposes of work within an agency, according to Millsaps. According to Judge Hollander, DOGE failed to adequately explain how its access to Americans' personal information falls within the scope of what's allowed by the Privacy Act, court filings show. 


	However, a panel of federal appeals court judges ruled that DOGE should be able to at least temporarily access Americans' personal data at the Department of Education and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), an issue at the heart of a lawsuit brought by Protect Democracy, which has sued Education, Treasury, and OPM on behalf of the American Federation of Teachers and other unions.

	It “does not stretch the imagination to think that modernizing an agency's software and IT systems would require administrator-level access to those systems, including any internal databases,” Judge Steven Agee wrote in a Monday ruling that lifted an injunction on DOGE from accessing data at Education and OPM. The panel allowed the injunction to remain in place for Treasury Department data.


	The Trump administration appears to have found something of a workaround for Privacy Act concerns by technically classifying some DOGE employees as working for government agencies. 


	Agee added: “The harm that might come from granting database access to an additional handful of government employees — prone as they may be to hacks or leaks, as the plaintiffs have alleged — strikes me as different in kind, not just in degree, from the harm inflicted by reporters, detectives, and paparazzi.”

	











	The ruling conflicts with other judges' opinions of DOGE's access to data. In her order prohibiting DOGE from continuing to access SSA data, Judge Hollander said that government lawyers representing the Trump administration “offered no meaningful explanation as to why the DOGE Team was in ‘need' of unprecedented, unfettered access to virtually SSA's entire data systems in order to accomplish the goals of modernizing technology, maximizing efficiency and productivity, and detecting fraud, waste, and abuse.” Hollander added that the “silence is deafening” when it came to the administration's failure to explicitly detail why DOGE needs access to SSA data. Instead, lawyers representing the Trump administration simply repeated an “incantation of a need to modernize the system and uncover fraud.”


	DOGE's access of SSA data supposedly to improve IT systems and uncover fraud “is tantamount to hitting a fly with a sledgehammer,” Hollander wrote in her order, which came on March 20.


	In response, SSA's acting commissioner Leland Dudek provided Hollander with an affidavit claiming DOGE employees need access to Americans' personal information as part of a project called “Are You Alive,” in addition to another project seeking to identify dead people within Social Security systems and a third project to detect fraud. 


	“To perform the Are You Alive Project,” DOGE employees “need access to individual Social Security numbers (SSNs), demographics, benefits status, and contact information, among other fields,” Dudek testified in his affidavit. “The access is necessary to examine whether the agency has assigned SSNs to all individual records, and to research and conduct outreach (as needed) to confirm a person's status as living or deceased.” 


	In addition to arguing that DOGE needs access to Americans' personal data to find dead people within SSA systems, the Trump administration has also claimed that data must be shared across government agencies to root out “fraud, waste, and abuse.” On the same day as Hollander's order demanding DOGE stop accessing SSA data, Trump signed an executive order titled “Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos.” The order calls for agencies to share data with one another and “rescind or modify all agency guidance that serves as a barrier to the inter- or intra-agency sharing of unclassified information.”


	Like DOGE's access to government data, the “Information Silos” executive order is another violation of the Privacy Act, according to Millsaps.

	











	“The president can't just say, ‘Well everyone has to share data.' The Privacy Act prohibits that,” Millsaps says. “The president is obviously just trying to get around the law. He's clearly just trying to rule by fiat. It's an unprecedented assault on the rule of law in our country.”


	MILLSAP'S LAWSUIT — filed on behalf of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the AFL-CIO, the Association of Administrative Law Judges and others — is just one of several lawsuits alleging DOGE is actively violating the Privacy Act by accessing Americans' personal information. Public Citizen is suing the Department of Education on behalf of the University of California Students Association; and Democratic attorneys general from 19 states are suing the Trump administration over DOGE's access to data as well as funding freezes.


	At OPM, DOGE has accessed the personal information of about 20 million Americans, including current and former federal employees as well as applicants for government jobs. Those employees include administrative law judges who adjudicate disagreements between agencies, companies and the public. Judge Som Ramrup is one of those judges, hearing disability cases for the SSA. As president of the Association of Administrative Law Judges (AALJ), she says the personal information of the organization's members is at risk of exposure thanks to DOGE's infiltration of OPM, noting that she and other administrative law judges are “are subjected to threats by disaffected members of the public.”


	Judges have to undergo background checks, information that's included in the OPM data DOGE has access to, as well as “a lot of information about judges, family members, and associates,” Ramrup tells Rolling Stone and American Doom. It's also not clear, according to Ramrup, what fraud DOGE might find in the personal information of 20 million government employees. 


	“Why do you need to know my Social Security number, my health care information, my family information? Because you don't need this data to accomplish the goal of modernizing the workforce or improving IT infrastructure,” Ramrup said. 


	Ramrup and Millsaps note that this exact data was the target of a hack of OPM databases by Chinese hackers in 2015. Part of their concerns — shared by the AFL-CIO labor union in its DOGE-related lawsuit against the SSA — is that Musk's organization isn't following proper security procedures to keep Americans' personal information out of the wrong hands. Those concerns were recently heightened when Reuters reported that DOGE's Edward “Big Balls” Coristine has ties to a cyber-crime group that claimed it had hacked government emails and had harassed a former FBI agent. Millsaps noted that Coristine was also fired from a cyber security firm under suspicion of leaking company information.

	











	“They're not people who have Americans' best interest at heart,” Millsaps said of Coristine and other DOGE staffers. “They're people who have the best interest of Elon Musk at heart.”


	MUSK, THE WHITE HOUSE, and congressional Republicans continue to insist that DOGE is working solely toward eliminating “waste, fraud and abuse” at government agencies. But a growing number of groups have expressed concern that DOGE is simply engaged in a massive data-gathering operation aimed at punishing Trump and Musk's political enemies and vulnerable populations.


	Advocates for the trans and immigrant communities are particularly concerned that DOGE's access to government data will allow the Trump administration to target trans Americans and even legal immigrants.


	“They are obviously trying to create lists of people — legal and illegal immigrants, trans… all the various types of people that they want to do harm to,” a former government employee with knowledge of DOGE's operations tells Rolling Stone and American Doom. “If you do not care about various laws, this is incredibly easy to do.”


	Trans and immigrant advocates say that DOGE's access to Social Security data allows the Trump administration to identify undocumented immigrants, green card holders, and trans Americans. Some of their suspicions were validated when The Washington Post reported that the IRS is finalizing a deal with Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE)  to share tax data with the agency to carry out immigration enforcement. The paper subsequently reported that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is seeking access to confidential IRS tax data to track down 7 million immigrants. Public Citizen is suing the IRS — the same agency whose data Nixon tried to use as a weapon against his political foes.


	Deborah Fleischaker, who worked in Homeland Security's civil rights office before serving as ICE's director of policy and later DHS' Chief Privacy Officer, tells Rolling Stone and American Doom that DOGE's access to government data and Trump's “Information Silos” executive order are “unbound from the law.”


	“There are reasons you have to balance the reasons for data sharing and privacy,” Fleischaker says. “There were processes and procedures in place, but we're in the wild west now.”


	Under other recent executive orders to rescind temporary protective status for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, Fleischaker says the Trump administration has simply increased the number of undocumented immigrants by removing protections for immigrants from the four counties, and can now use government data to track them down.

	











	“They are very consciously widening the aperture of people who will be undocumented, then maximalizing data-sharing to go after them and get them,” Fleischaker says.


	Another recent executive order requires the SSA to share data with state and local officials involved in removing ineligible voters from voter rolls — another possible violation of the Privacy Act. The order, titled “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of Elections,” gives DOGE the power to subpoena state voter rolls to hunt for ineligible voters, potentially expanding the data-gathering operation of Musk's organization.

FX has set a premiere date for Adults, its new comedy from The Tonight Show scribes Ben Kronengold and Rebecca Shaw. 


	The ensemble series, which was formerly titled Snowflakes, premieres May 28 with two episodes. It follows five friends — Samir (Malik Elassal), Billie (Lucy Freyer), Paul Baker (Jack Innanen), Issa (Amita Rao) and Anton (Owen Thiele) — who crash together in Samir's childhood home. FX says “the show puts a slightly heightened twist on the wins, losses and humiliations of starting out in the adult world. Whether they're trying to get ahead at work, navigating the healthcare system, hosting a dinner party or dating in the age of Find My Friends, the group is finding that nothing about the real world is simple, and all their best intentions tend to make things worse.”

	











	Charlie Cox, Julia Fox, D'Arcy Carden, Grace Kuhlenschmidt, John Reynolds and Ray Nicholson will guest star in the first season. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	“We're so grateful to be telling this story about a group of friends navigating the hardest, horniest time of life together,” Kronengold and Shaw said in a joint statement last year after the show was picked up. “FX comedies have defined our generation, and we can't wait to show them the consequences.”


	The entire eight-episode season will become available May 29 on Hulu and FX on Demand. FX will continued to air two episodes each Wednesday for the following three weeks. 


Adults is executive produced by Kronengold and Shaw, along with Nick Kroll (Big Mouth, The League), Stefani Robinson (Atlanta, What We Do in the Shadows), Sarah Naftalis (What We Do in the Shadows) and Jonathan Krisel (Baskets, English Teacher). Alicia Van Couvering (Tiny Furniture, Drinking Buddies) also serves as an executive producer under Kroll's Good At Business banner. 


Adults is produced by FX Productions.

20th Century Studios has announced that Predator: Killer of Killers, an original animated film set in the Predator universe, will premiere exclusively on Hulu on June 6, also unveiling first-look footage, which you can view above.


	Directed by Dan Trachtenberg, who's held the reins to the Predator franchise since 2022 Hulu hit Prey, Killer of Killers is an anthology story following three of the fiercest warriors in human history: a Viking raider guiding her young son on a bloody quest for revenge, a ninja in feudal Japan who turns against his Samurai brother in a brutal battle for succession, and a WWII pilot who takes to the sky to investigate an otherworldly threat to the Allied cause. While all these warriors are killers in their own right, they are merely prey for their new opponent — the ultimate killer of killers.

	











	Josh Wassung of animation company The Third Floor served as co-director of the project. Micho Robert Rutare penned the script from a story conceived with Trachtenberg, based on characters created by Jim Thomas & John Thomas. John Davis, Trachtenberg, Marc Toberoff, and Ben Rosenblatt produced, with Lawrence Gordon, James E. Thomas, John C. Thomas, and Stefan Grube serving as executive producers.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Unusually, this year will feature two Predator features, with the other, the live-action Predator: Badlands, also helmed by Trachtenberg, hitting theaters via 20th on November 7. Elle Fanning stars in a story said to examine an unlikely allyship between her character, Thia, and a young Predator. The actress took to CinemaCon in Las Vegas to preview the film last week.

“The White Lotus” series creator Mike White is speaking out on former colleague Cristóbal Tapia de Veer, who announced his exit from the show the week the highly-anticipated Season 3 finale was set to air. The Emmy-winning composer told the New York Times that a clash about the Season 3 theme song with White was in part why he opted to leave the buzzy series. At the time, Tapia de Veer admitted that he did not tell White about quitting and decided to wait until “just at the end for the shock.”

Now, White is weighing in. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






“I honestly don't know what happened, except now I'm reading his interviews because he decides to do some PR campaign about him leaving the show,” White said during “The Howard Stern Show” from THR. “I don't think he respected me. He wants people to know that he's edgy and dark and I'm…I don't know, like, I watch reality TV. […] I was thrown that he would go to The New York Times to shit on me and the show three days before the finale. It was kind of a bitch move.”

White also took issue with Tapia de Veer claiming that he and the auteur “already had our last fight forever.” According to White, no such arguments took place. 

“We never really even fought. He says we feuded. I don't think I ever had a fight with him — except for maybe some emails,” White said (Tapia de Veer also claimed that White was “just saying no to anything,” including objecting to releasing the longer theme song.) “It was basically me giving him notes. I don't think he liked to go through the process of getting notes from me, or wanting revisions, because he didn't respect me. I knew he wasn't a team player and that he wanted to do it his way.” 

White pointed to how “The White Lotus” elevated Tapia de Veer's career, and allegedly emboldened Tapia de Veer to mistreat White. 

“By the time the third season came around, he'd won Emmys and he had his song go viral,” White said. “He didn't want to go through the process with me, he didn't want to go to sessions. He would always look at me with this contemptuous smirk on his face like he thought I was a chimp or something. He's definitely making a big deal out of a creative difference. He is very talented. [But] I've never kissed somebody's ass so hard to just get him to — to lead that horse to water. Have fun with whatever you're doing next.”

 










To the NYT, Tapia de Veer did confirm that his dynamic with White changed across the course of the viral series. The first theme song for Season 1 of the series was actually created by Tapia de Veer for a Nike ad with Kanye West. Tapia de Veer then collaborated with White amid legal issues with West to adjust the tone of the track, and the rest is “White Lotus” history. 

“Maybe I was being unprofessional, and, for sure, Mike feels that I was always unprofessional to him because I didn't give him what he wanted,” Tapia de Veer said of concluding his collaboration with White. “But what I gave him did this, you know — [won] those Emmys, people going crazy [for the show]…That is the main thing that I'm most happy about — it was worth all the tension and almost forcing the music into the show, in a way, because I didn't have that many allies in there. This was a good struggle.”

Logic suggests that rogue CIA assassin Jason Bourne might be much less of a threat if — instead of a shredded government super-soldier with a sniper's accuracy and no personal attachments — he were a vaguely autistic wife guy who couldn't hit someone with a bazooka if they were standing right in front of him. James Hawes' “The Amateur” begs to differ. 

An aggressively competent spy thriller that has less use for logic than its lead actor does for his smile, this globe-trotting Robert Littell adaptation would have us believe that no one is more dangerous than a math nerd who refuses to think of himself as a killer, and the film makes a compelling enough case to sustain itself across the entire television season's worth of plot that it packs into two hours. Rami Malek has made that argument before, of course, and the “Mr. Robot” star's decision to play another socially maladapted hacker type suggests that he would rather weaponize his established strengths than correct for his weaknesses — an oddly fitting choice for the savant-like cryptographer he plays here.

An unblinking human sweater vest who's married to a beatific Rachel Brosnahan, Langley-based cryptographer Charlie Heller loves exactly three things in this world: His wife, his wife, and sifting through confidential data sets in order to determine that unknown members of the CIA have been assassinating targets in the Middle East and blaming the kills on suicide bombers. But mostly he loves his wife. When Sarah asks Charlie to make him a cup of coffee in the morning, he replies “of course!” with the enthusiasm of a dog who's just been asked if it wants to go for a walk; in a spy movie so humorless it makes “The Good Shepherd” look like “Goldmember” by comparison, Malek's sincerity in that moment is the closest thing we get to a laugh. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






Unfortunately for Charlie, Sarah so obviously exists to get fridged that she might as well be a piece of Tupperware. And so, when our mild-mannered hero's wife is taken hostage — and killed execution style — while on a business trip to London, Charlie is the only person on Earth who seems to be surprised. CIA Deputy Director Alex Moore (Holt McCallany, born for this) certainly knows more than he lets on, even if his boss (Julianne Nicholson in full “Paradise” mode) seems to be in the dark. 

 










When Charlie resolves to hunt down the men who killed Sarah, Director Moore only agrees to let the twerpy computer genius get some much-needed field training because a firing range is a really convenient place to put someone who you might want to shoot “by accident.” That gruesome job would fall to Robert Henderson (Laurence Fishburne), a rather Morpheus-like mentor who feels like he's wasting his time on a brilliant man who doesn't have what it takes to pull the trigger. And Robert is right on both counts: Charlie is smart enough to slip off to Europe before the CIA has the chance to wipe him off the board, and also gutless enough that he tries to commit his first kill with… pollen. 

And so it goes for a cloak and dagger yarn that uses its outward seriousness as a cover for the silliness at its core — a cover that it maintains with the help of Volker Bertelmann's sawing, “Conclave”-loud violin score. Still, “The Amateur” never forgets its true identity, and while Hawes' previous feature, the Holocaust-tinged biographical drama “One Life,” offers a strangely accurate preview of the tone at work here, the film seldom takes itself as seriously as its po-faced spycraft might suggest. Imagine a movie shot to resemble a less shaky version of “The Bourne Identity,” except — in the first proper fight scene — our hero isn't throwing down with a beefed out henchman so much as he's clawing at a middle-aged woman who's in the middle of asphyxiating from an allergy attack. And he only wins the bout on a technicality. 

 










“The Amateur” doesn't play any of this for comedy, but there's something inherently funny about Malek's surprise at his character's own capacity for violence. Even as Charlie evolves into a master hitman, he's still caught off guard by the sounds of his own explosions, and — as it criss-crosses Europe from one target to the next — the movie is sustained by the way that Malek allows the character's discomfort to grow alongside his confidence (the former expressed through the actor's eyes, the latter exclusively with the point of his chin).

By that, and by the all too rare decision to (obviously) shoot on location. So far as “Bourne” wannabes go, this one is awful light on action, but Hawes uses the money he saved on massive stunts to shoot Malek scurrying through the nightclubs of Marseille, the hilly streets of Istanbul, and a handful of other very real places that all combine to lend the action — or lack thereof — a degree of movement that's credible enough to disguise how Ken Nolan and Gary Spinelli's screenplay prefers to spin in circles. 

Running a well-paced two hours, “The Amateur” doesn't have time to stuff in all of the stuff that its story requires in order to make (enough) sense by the end, which forces a crucial thread like the departmental pissing match between Charlie's CIA bosses to feel like a supplemental B-plot rather than something that's inextricable from Charlie's mission. The same could be said of Fishburne's character, whose allegiance is more fun to track than his whereabouts, and of Jon Bernthal's two-scene performance as a badass field agent known as The Bear (lol), who exists to personify the kind of spy movie we're used to seeing. 

 










Even major aspects of Charlie's emotionality tend to fall by the wayside, as “The Amateur” — more self-assured than its main character, but similarly unwilling to get its hands dirty — only glancingly connects the dots between its protagonist's extra-judicial killings and the ones the CIA is trying to keep covered up. The implication is that modern technology has turned murder into a coward's game, as the growing distance between weapons and their targets invites the kind of moral disconnect that allows people to lie to themselves (and their country), but the disconnect between Charlie and his handlers is too vast for either of them to render dramatically interesting judgment on the other. 

If the movie wags its finger at Charlie as he closes in on the man who executed his wife (Michael Stuhlbarg as a bearded German baddie), that's only because the seriousness of its tone requires “The Amateur” to gesture toward depth, just as the absurdity of its plot occasionally requires “The Amateur” to remind us that it's not that serious — which it accomplishes with the help of some ridiculously angelic visions of Sarah, dead-wifing so hard that it feels like she's hoping to be reincarnated into a Christopher Nolan film. That balancing act results in a spy adventure that's neither fun nor dull, and in almost exactly equal measure. But there's no doubt that Charlie is dangerous, and I wouldn't be opposed to a sequel where he's forced to figure out what to do with that information; a sequel in which neither he nor the potential franchise around him can write off its errors as rookie mistakes.

 










20th Century Studios will release “The Amateur” in theaters on Friday, April 11.

Authorities are still searching for survivors after the roof fell at the Jet Set in Santo Domingo.


	The roof of the Jet Set nightclub, a well-known venue in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic, collapsed during a live performance early Tuesday (April 8). CNN and the Associated Press are reporting that at least 44 people have been confirmed dead, with another 160 injured. Rescuers are racing to reach about 100 people who are still trapped, according to CNN.

	It wasn't immediately clear what caused the roof to collapse.


	So far, at last 146 people have been rescued, according to CNN. More than 300 people were inside the club at the time of the roof collapse.

	











	Among the injured is merengue singer Rubby Pérez, who was performing when the roof fell, officials said. The singer was taken to the Plaza de la Salud hospital, according to medical director Nepomuceno Mejía.


	Pérez daughter Zulinka, who is also one of his backup singers, told local media that her father was “found singing” under debris. She explained: “He started singing so they could hear him. He's always told me: ‘If something ever happens to me, cover me so no one takes pictures.'”


	The AP reported that the Pérez's manager, Enrique Paulino, spoke to reporters at the scene about the collapse that happened about an hour after the show began at midnight. Paulino said that Pérez's saxophone player was killed in the incident.


	Among the deceased is Nelsy Milagros Cruz Martinez, the governor of Monte Cristi, CNN reported. She was also the sister of former Seattle Mariners player Nelson Cruz. 


	Authorities have launched extensive search and rescue efforts, with the national police sharing on its Instagram account early Tuesday that there have been “101 transfers have been made to different hospital centers in the National District,” noting that “search, rescue and medical assistance” is ongoing in the area, where an estimated 300 people had gathered for the concert.


	“We presume that many of them are still alive, and that is why the authorities here will not give up until not a single person remains under that rubble,” Juan Manuel Méndez, director of the Center of Emergency Operations, said of the search for survivors and victims inside the venue, according to the AP.


Jet Set issued a statement later on Tuesday morning, sharing condolences to the families of those impacted by the roof collapse. “Last night, a tragedy struck that has deeply shaken the hearts of everyone who is part of Jet Set and all Dominicans. The loss of human lives leaves us in a state of profound sorrow and grief,” the venue shared in part on its Instagram account. “In this difficult moment, our prayers are with each of the affected families. We share their pain as if it were our own, as we too are in mourning. We are working fully and transparently with the competent authorities to assist the victims and clarify what happened … We join the country in expressing solidarity during this unexpected and painful situation.”

	











	Carolina Mejía de Garrigó, the mayor of Santo Domingo, also discussed the “terrible tragedy” and the action being taken in messages posted to X. “My deepest sympathy goes out to the families still waiting for news of their loved ones,” she wrote. “Our National District Disaster Prevention, Mitigation, and Response Committee is active and in permanent session. We will continue to make every effort and remain united in prayer.”


	President Luis Abinader also wrote on X that all rescue agencies are “working tirelessly” to help those affected. “We deeply regret the tragedy that occurred at the Jet Set nightclub. We have been following the incident minute by minute since it occurred,” he shared.

Elon Musk went off on Donald Trump‘s top trade adviser Peter Navarro, as the latter figure dismissed the billionaire's criticism of a chief architect of the administration's tariff policy.


	On his X platform, Musk called Navarro “a moron,” “dumber than a sack of bricks” and used an offensive slur for people with intellectual disabilities. He also mocked Navarro over claims that he had created a fake expert, Ron Vara.


	Earlier on CNBC, Navarro said that Musk was not a car manufacturer, but a “car assembler,” arguing that Tesla relies on batteries from Japan and China, and the electronics come from Taiwan.

	











	“We want the tires made in Akron. We want the transmissions made in Indianapolis. We want the engines made in Flint and Saginaw, and we want the cars manufactured here,” Navarro said.

	Musk responded, “By any definition whatsoever, Tesla is the most vertically integrated auto manufacturer in America with the highest percentage of US content. Navarro should ask the fake expert he invented, Ron Vara.”


	According to The Washington Post, Musk has tried to talk Trump out of the tariff plan, while he has posted a video to X in which late economist Milton Friedman talks up the benefits of trade deals. Musk also has talked of a free trade zone between Europe and the United States.

The 15th anniversary of the beloved Lower East Side Film Festival (LESFF) has a star-studded lineup. IndieWire can announce that LESFF 2025 will open with the New York premiere of Pete Ohs' “The True Beauty of Being Bitten by a Tick” May 1. The festival will conclude May 5 with Lola Rocknrolla's true crime documentary “The Big Johnson” about drag queen Dean Johnson. 

“Our Opening and Closing Night films are proof that indie filmmaking packs a punch,” Roxy Hunt, LESFF Co-Director and CEO of BFD Productions, said. “Pete Ohs and Lola Rocknrolla are true badass filmmakers, telling stories that are daring, original, and unapologetic. At a time when Hollywood is playing it safe and overlooking bold, visionary voices, independent film is where authentic stories have the freedom to break through. LESFF has always been about championing that spirit, and this year is no different.”

 “The True Beauty of Being Bitten by a Tick” had its world premiere at SXSW. The film stars Zoë Chao, Jeremy O. Harris, Callie Hernandez, and James Cusati-Moyer a as friend group whose weekend retreat goes unsettlingly wrong after an ominous tick bite seems to unravel reality.

In contrast, “The Big Johnson” tells the story of late NYC legend Dean Johnson, who was a drag queen, rock star, activist, and enigma, per the logline. “A towering figure in the underground scene, Johnson's shocking, unsolved death remains a mystery. Was it murder? Was it an accident? One thing's for sure: Dean changed New York forever,” as the description reads. 

“'The Big Johnson' is thrilled to have our New York premiere at the LES Film Festival,” director Lola Rocknrolla said. “Dean Johnson lived most of his adult life on the Lower East Side and I lived on Ludlow Street for the better part of a decade. Roxy Hunt and Tony Castle are the best festival curators I have ever worked with and they really care about keeping film and culture alive. This is our neighborhood, this is our festival and we can't freakin' wait for it.” 

LESFF will take place May 1 to 5, and will have screenings at Village East by Angelika and DCTV's Firehouse Cinema. Purchase tickets to the Lower East Side Film Festival here. 

This festival also marks the launch of its first-ever Stay Indie Project, a direct pipeline for independent filmmakers to get their projects made. Launched in collaboration with BFD Productions, the initiative connects independent filmmakers with development, financing, and production support to greenlit indie films. The first Stay Indie project to be part of the festival is feature “Not One Drop of Blood,” which had its world premiere at Filmfort (Treefort Music Fest, Idaho) before screening at The Florida Film Festival. It will have its New York premiere at LESFF out of competition.

 










“Not One Drop of Blood” is produced by LESFF co-directors Hunt and Tony Castle, as well as LESFF Board Member Sarah Wharton. The feature documentary film is directed by Jackson Devereux and Lachlan Hinton, and follows the decades-long mystery of unexplained cattle mutilations in rural Oregon. The doc was based on Anna King's NPR reporting; King produces the film that was financed and produced in partnership with BFD Productions, Northpoint Post, and Copperline Creative. 

“With the Stay Indie Project, we're helping tear down the biggest roadblock indie filmmakers face — getting their films made,” Tony Castle, LESFF Co-Director and COO of BFD Productions, said. “It's not enough to just celebrate independent film; we need to actively build a pipeline for bold, risk-taking storytellers to get their work out into the world. By pairing the festival with our production company, we're giving filmmakers real resources, real funding, and real momentum. But it doesn't stop at making movies — we're here to make sure they get seen. Getting indie films into actual cinemas, on the big screen, where they belong—that's what it's all about. Watching movies together, in the dark, the way they were meant to be experienced. That's the magic. That's the mission.” 

 










Additional Stay Indie Project features in the works include narrative film “Our Bodies and Other Shames,” written by Malka Wallick and directed by Jenny Lester; and documentaries “The Ark,” “Hoop Like This,” and “Credible Fear.” 

“Our Bodies and Other Shames” stars Alysia Reiner, Micaela Diamond, Gideon Adlon, and Malka Wallick as childhood best friends who are forced to confront their past when one is diagnosed with breast cancer.

“The Ark,” which is directed by Jeremy Chilnick and Viacheslav Rakovskyi, centers on a young Ukrainian family who, in the midst of war, transforms their farm into a refuge for 1,000 displaced animals. 

“Hoop Like This” is directed by Shubhangi Shekhar and follows the best Indian basketball players from around the globe as they join forces to compete in the world's highest stakes basketball tournament on ESPN to prove to the world that brown men can jump. 

“Credible Fear,” directed by Gabrielle Ewing, is about a chance pairing between Yojana, a Guatemalan asylum seeker, and Amy, a DC attorney, during a seven-year battle for justice inside America's broken immigration system.

The full LESFF program will be announced soon.

	Now that the dust has settled from HBO's The White Lotus third season finale, creator Mike White is getting candid about the show's Emmy-winning composer announcing he's quitting the show. 


	Talking to Howard Stern on Tuesday, White was asked about composer Cristóbal Tapia de Veer saying he's not returning for the HBO drama's fourth season after feuding with White over show's score. The composer told The New York Times last week that he is exiting the show, saying, “We already had our last fight forever.” 




	“I honestly don't know what happened, except now I'm reading his interviews because he decides to do some PR campaign about him leaving the show,” White said. “I don't think he respected me. He wants people to know that he's edgy and dark and I'm, I don't know, like I watch reality TV. We never really even fought. He says we feuded. I don't think I ever had a fight with him — except for maybe some emails. It was basically me giving him notes. I don't think he liked to go through the process of getting notes from me, or wanting revisions, because he didn't respect me. I knew he wasn't a team player and that he wanted to do it his way. I was thrown that he would go to The New York Times to shit on me and the show three days before the finale. It was kind of a bitch move.”

	White added that he struggled with de Veer during the first two seasons. “By the time the third season came around, he'd won Emmys and he had his song go viral, he didn't want to go through the process with me, he didn't want to go to sessions. He would always look at me with this contemptuous smirk on his face like he thought I was a chimp or something … he's definitely making a big deal out of a creative difference.”


	Stern marveled: “You're the genius behind this thing. Why quit a hit show because you got some notes and some differences? Just work it out.”


	White replied, “He is very talented. [But] I've never kissed somebody's ass so hard to just get him to — to lead that horse to water. Have fun with whatever you're doing next.”


	In the Times story, de Veer said, “Maybe I was being unprofessional, and, for sure, Mike feels that I was always unprofessional to him because I didn't give him what he wanted. But what I gave him did this, you know — [won] those Emmys, people going crazy [for the show] … That is the main thing that I'm most happy about — it was worth all the tension and almost forcing the music into the show, in a way, because I didn't have that many allies in there … This was a good struggle.”

	











	With season three having broken ratings records for the series, White also revealed he's currently renegotiating his HBO deal ahead of the show's fourth season, while Stern pressed him on how much money he's going to make. 


	“We are renegotiating right now, I'm definitely curious to find out what that [amount] is,” White said. “I feel like I have financial security for sure … at a certain point with money, [you wonder]: ‘Is this going to make me worse?' Is having more money just going to make me more dysfunctional?”


	Stern, of course, also pressed White on infamous “incest hand job” between Patrick Schwarzenegger and Sam Nivola's sibling characters and the creator admitted that, to some degree, he was indeed trying to generate some shock and attention for the show.


	“In the show, it's a trope where gay sex is like a jump scare,” he said. “I just felt like we had to build a trope. We had done faux incest [in season two, where two characters turned out not to be related], so maybe we should do real incest. Beyond the shock of it, just to have a character like Patrick[‘s Saxon], who's all about getting off and just thinks of sex in base terms, what would need to happen to him to where he'd suddenly have to pull the brakes on the way he's thinking? I was trying to think of a way that would be integral to his character. But it would be a talking point for sure. Once we cast Patrick and Sam [and they saw the script], I told them, ‘You guys can still get out of this, you're going to be the face of gay incest.'”

	











	White also said he's been reading all the finale coverage and has been angsting a bit over the (relatively modest) criticisms out there.


	“They're criticizing the show in certain ways and they're meaner in certain ways [now that the show is popular],” White said. “I'm used to being this underdog indie writer that people are championing. Certain things will hurt my feelings or I'll feel misunderstood. The mean ones have gotten meaner. It's like they don't like me. I guess I need to either avoid that stuff or get tougher, because it does bum me out.”


	Some of the finale gripes that bothered White the most were — for instance — complaints that the surviving characters should be getting interviewed by Thai police after the tragic resort murders in the last episode. 


	“Little logic police — really, you can't enjoy the vibe and the emotional arcs because you're so caught up in the — this isn't a police procedural, this is a rumination-type show,” he said. “It makes me want to pull my hair out. Is this how you watch movies and TV shows? Constant literal police?”


	In fact, White says he's about to hit the road again to get out of Los Angeles and clear his head. 


	“I'm going to Colombia today just to get the hell out of here,” he said. “I've never been there. I don't think [season four is] going to South America, but I've never been there. Maybe one day. I just got to get out of L.A. I'm scrolling on my phone and reading shit about the show and this is not the finish line that I want.”

	Gotham Award winner Danielle Deadwyler (Till) is teaming with Alix Madigan and Michael Sherman to develop and produce The Street, a feature adaptation of the novel by Ann Petry, in which she's set to star.


	Also aboard the project is Gina Atwater (Westworld), who will write the script and serve as executive producer.


	Reissued in 2022, Petry's 1946 debut novel was famously the first book by a Black woman to sell over one million copies. This is the harrowing story of young Black woman Lutie Johnson (Deadwyler) and her spirited struggle to raise her son amid the violence, poverty, and racial dissonance of Harlem in the late 1940s. 

	











	In a statement accompanying the development announcement, Deadwyler said, “Ann Petry's The Street has quaked my understanding of motherhood, Black and American family life experiences on how to just get by (historically), and the festering emotions that seed alongside the wilted optimism and dark hope of the American Dream.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	She called The Street “essential to American literature,” saying that this was “evident upon its marvelous critically acclaimed debut; and, now, with this steadfast and dynamic collaboration with Alix, Michael, Gina, myself and the Petry estate, we hope to rumble the film landscape with an adaptation of her evergreen tale of the lengths to which one mother, one woman is stretched for self, family and the costs of survival.”


	Commented Madigan and Sherman, “We are inspired to be a part of bringing Ann Petry's harrowing classic to life with Danielle and Gina and could not imagine better creative collaborators to partner with on this journey.”


	Currently, Deadwyler can be seen starring in Universal & Blumhouse's horror film The Woman in the Yard, which opened March 28. Recently seen in Netflix's smash hit Christmas action thriller Carry-On, her other best known credits include Station Eleven, Till, The Piano Lesson, and The Harder They Fall. Other upcoming projects for the actressinclude HBO's untitled Steve Carell comedy from Bill Lawrence, Matt Tarses and Warner Bros. TV, as well as Fifth Season's Otis & Zelma opposite John Boyega, of which she is an EP.


	Atwater wrote on HBO's Westworld, has developed TV for Apple and HBO, and just wrapped up a multi-year overall deal at Netflix. Currently, she's writing and producing Myrtis, based on the life of bull rider Myrtis Dightman, with Dee Rees attached to direct, in addition to developing projects at Orion Pictures and Ley Line Entertainment. 

	











	An Oscar nominee, Madigan has produced titles like Winter's Bone and Hold Your Breath. Credits for Sherman include The Truffle Hunters, The Fight, and Native Son, to name just a few.


	Deadwyler is represented by Paradigm, Play Management, and Ziffren Brittenham; Atwater by The Mission Entertainment, CAA, and Gang, Tyre, Ramer.

SPOILER ALERT! This post contains details from Margaret Atwood's novel The Testaments, which may allude to certain plot points in the final season of The Handmaid‘s Tale.


	The end of Hulu‘s The Handmaid's Tale is nigh, but the story of Gilead will continue in the upcoming sequel series The Testaments, which creator Bruce Miller tells Deadline is in the casting phase and will give a very different perspective on the oppressive nation.


	Based on the novel by Margaret Atwood, The Testaments will take place several years after the events of the final season of The Handmaid's Tale. The story follows the lives of three women, Aunt Lydia (Anne Dowd), Agnes and Daisy, whose fates become intertwined as they uncover the secrets of Gilead and the resistance against its regime.

	“It's about growing up Gilead. It feels like exactly the opposite world. These are…the most precious girls in Gilead,” Miller teased. “And yet you start to realize they're walking a plank as well, just like the Handmaids. Hannah has to deal with the June inside of her [and] all of a sudden she starts to feel mighty, mighty, mighty rebellious.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Avid Handmaid's Tale viewers will know that Agnes is Gilead's given name for June and Luke's daughter Hannah, who as of Season 6 is training to become a Wife. There are still some key story beats that need to play out in order to get these characters from where they currently stand in the original series to where they'll be when we pick up with them in The Testaments.


	Ann Dowd's Aunt Lydia, for example, is still trying to play by the rules while simultaneously protecting her Handmaids from the horrors that she's become more and more sensitive to over the last few seasons. But, in The Testaments, she'll be an instrumental part of the rebellion.


	“It is very different for her this season, because she has she's trying to expand her power. She's trying to work her power in other places, places that are not just with the Handmaids, but the wider world,” Miller says of the character's Season 6 arc. “Lydia is trying to do a very difficult job well, and I think she realizes over time that these girls are valuable on their own and is trying to kind of figure out a way to do her job that she's said ‘I'm going to do,' and also recognize the humanity of these girls that she can't quite ignore.” 

	











	Pivotal to her development this season will be her struggle for control, even as it is seemingly slipping further away from her. 


	“I think that her level of control is kind of getting sapped by herself. She's undercutting herself and saying, ‘I want to control these women, but I can't, because I feel like that's wrong,' and she's a very right and wrong person,” Miller explains. “But I think that what she does, what this season brings her to, is the idea that that — what happens to someone who enjoys control when they realize they have nothing? They don't just fold under. What happens as we move forward and as we move into The Testaments is she tries to get more control.”


	He continued: “What becomes someone like Lydia, who has not just desire to be in control, but confidence and actual competence in being in control? What happens to someone like that? Well, they don't just sit by the wayside. They actually, if you tell them no and beat them up, they take your country.”


	The first three episodes of The Handmaid's Tale Season 6 are now streaming on Hulu.

River Gallo‘s neo-noir thriller “Ponyboi” has had a long walk to the screen. The feature is based on actor/writer Gallo's 2019 short film, which won the New York Short jury grand prize at NewFest31. Gallo reprises the title role for the feature adaptation, which Gallo also writes and produces; Esteban Arango directs.

After premiering at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival as a sales title, “Ponyboi” is finally opening for audiences in theaters. The film centers on Latinx intersex sex worker Ponyboi (Gallo), who works at a New Jersey laundromat where he is employed both as a clerk and drug dealer. The feature unfolds over the course of a single day after Ponyboi is thrown into chaos when a drug deal goes wrong, forcing him to go on the run from the mob.

Dylan O'Brien plays Ponyboi's pimp, with Victoria Pedretti as Ponyboi's best friend. Murray Bartlett is cast as a possible client. Indya Moore also stars.

“The road to making ‘Ponyboi' has been as long as the New Jersey Turnpike — the backdrop of the film and a meaningful location in my childhood landscape,” Gallo said in a press statement. “Despite being raised as a ‘normal' boy, when I was 12, my parents disclosed I had Anorchia, a condition where my testicles were absent at birth. Without my consent, I was forced to undergo cosmetic plastic surgery and testosterone treatment to present as a cisgender man. I spent years hiding my true identity. When I was 27 years old, I decided to explore this part of myself by making the short film iteration of ‘Ponyboi.' In that process, I discovered for the first time that the condition I was born with is part of the intersex umbrella, a term for those born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn't fit the typical definitions of female or male. I belong to a community of 1.7 percent of the world's population that has faced stigmatization and still endures non-consensual human rights violations.”

Gallo continued, “This pivotal discovery led me to finally come to terms with my intersex, non-binary, and trans identity. It ignited a passion to tell my story. There exists no representation of intersex people in the current film or television landscape. It is about time! I want ‘Ponyboi' to be the film I needed when I was younger and felt so lost. I firmly believe ‘Ponyboi' is poised to start a societal revolution by being the first narrative feature film created by and starring an intersex person to enter the popular culture. It will take an intersex film like ‘Ponyboi' to touch the hearts of audiences and break through the cultural zeitgeist in order for real change to happen.” 

 










“Ponyboi” recently won the NewFest 2024 Grand Jury Award, with the U.S. Narrative Feature category jurors saying in a statement, “This is a film that, we felt, bridged the space of humanistic storytelling at its highest level. This year, we award ‘Ponyboi‘ for its beautiful writing, performances, and cinematic storytelling. This film is a beautiful blend of personal storytelling that highlights River Gallo's personal journey and interweaves a daring and propulsive thriller. It's a brave invitation to a brave new world, blending skill, joy and heart while exciting us about the future of films.”

The IndieWire review also applauded the “unapologetic crime saga for having flourishes of comedy and romance often comes across as excitingly undefinable.” 

“Director Arango deftly interprets Gallo's script bridging the melange of ideas in ways that function to draw a touching portrait of an individual with an abysmally underrepresented gender identity while preserving a darkly comedic tone and making it visually idiosyncratic,” the review reads. “It's Gallo's charmingly fierce performance that anchors all the loose pieces. They communicate Ponyboi's fury, fear, and fated fabulousness with the intentionality and first-hand connection of an artist who has been waiting their entire life to tell this story exactly as fearlessly as this movie does.” 

 










“Ponyboi” premieres in theaters June 27 from FOX Entertainment Studios' Tideline banner. Check out the trailer below.

	Authorities are continuing to search through the rubble at the Jet Set nightclub in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, which saw mass casualties and injuries after its roof collapsed during an event in the early hours of Tuesday, April 8.


	The incident occurred within the hour after midnight, according to Associated Press. Among those who were present, at least 18 attendees have died, and more than 120 have been injured or hospitalized. Montecristi governor Nelsy Cruz was reportedly killed, as was the saxophonist who performed on stage with merengue singer Rubby Pérez. Pérez himself sustained injuries, according to his manager, Enrique Paulino.


	“We presume that many of them are still alive, and that is why the authorities here will not give up until not a single person remains under that rubble,” said Juan Manuel Méndez, director of the Center of Emergency Operations. Ambulances are traveling between the nightclub site and the local hospital as authorities work to uncover more concertgoers. 

	











	Paulino noted that he initially thought the rumble was an incoming earthquake. In a video from the event uploaded to social media, a man can be seen pointing at the ceiling and noting that something had just fallen over the crowd. “It happened so quickly,” Paulino told local reporters. “I managed to throw myself into a corner.”

	“We deeply regret the tragedy that occurred at the Jet Set nightclub,” President Luis Abinader wrote on X. “We have been following the incident minute by minute since it occurred. All relief agencies have provided the necessary assistance and are working tirelessly in the rescue efforts. Our prayers are with the affected families.”


	The number of patrons present at the time of the collapse is unknown at the moment. Jet Set holds a total capacity of 2,000, per Resident Advisor, and regularly hosts concert events on Monday evenings.

Turnstile are coming back with their first album since 2021's Glow On. The new album, Never Enough, is out on June 6 via Roadrunner. Leading the full-length is the title song, which arrives with a music video directed by singer Brendan Yates and guitarist Pat McCrory. Watch the new video below.

Brendan Yates produced Never Enough, with the band members recording the album in Los Angeles and Baltimore. The new album is the first from Turnstile since the departure of founding guitarist Brady Ebert. The band now features guitarist Meg Mills, who joined Yates, McCrory, bassist Franz Lyons, and drummer Daniel Fang.

Turnstile have a handful of festival slots lined up for the spring, summer, and autumn. See the Baltimore experimental hardcore band's tour dates below.

Glow On was a true breakout album for Turnstile, earning the group three nominations at the 2023 Grammy Awards. They followed it with the New Heart Designs remix EP, featuring a new version of “Alien Love Call” made with BadBadNotGood and Blood Orange. That track got nominated for Best Remixed Recording at the 2024 Grammy Awards.

Kelsea Ballerini won over Adam Levine during her first season as “The Voice” coach. “We got along famously instantly — like a nice, friendly, sweet version of when I met Blake [Shelton],” Levine told People on April 7.

The “Maroon 5” frontman recalled recording a performance with the other coaches and getting teased by Ballerini. 

“I've only really ever sung with an ensemble group of people on ‘The Voice' so it's still foreign to me a little bit,” he shared to People.

Levine continued, “And I go in my feelings, go inside a little bit, close my eyes, whatever — and we did a take of this song for the coaches' performance, and then she looked up at me, and she'd be like, ‘Hey, you going to pretend you like us?'”

The “Payphone” singer found the ribbing hilarious and thought Ballerini was cool for poking fun at him. “What I like about her is that what you see is what you get,” he said.

A post shared by Kelsea Ballerini (@kelseaballerini)

During the February 24 episode of “The Voice,” Ballerini revealed that she had some anxiety about Levine prior to meeting him because of what Shelton had told her.

“He was like, ‘Adam's tough. Sometimes, he's mean. He's competitive. He's ruthless,'” Ballerini told Levine. “He was wrong. You're lovely. You're really nice,” she added.

Levine joked, “Thank you. I feel like Blake was, like, hazing you. Something like that. He's mean. He's not a nice guy. He's not a nice person. If he's being nice to you, that means he's lying.”

It was clear Levine was still fond of his friend when he said, “I miss Blake. I'm in his mangy, musty chair.”

In a January 30 interview with Extra TV, Ballerini expressed her excitement about being a coach on “The Voice.”

“I'm the new girl. I love it!” she exclaimed. “I feel like now, by this point, my nerves are gone, I kind of know the ropes. 

“We have all of our vibes, and I just feel comfortable. I'm so happy to be here,” Ballerini gushed.

Levine, who had been absent from “The Voice” since season 17, said of his return, “It feels great to be back with my ‘Voice' family. Turning to his castmates, he added, “I love these guys so much.”

John Legend returned the love and said, “He was there for my first season and then we hadn't been together as coaches since then, and he just came right back in like he never left.”

Authorities search for survivors after the roof fell at the Jet Set in Santo Domingo.


	The roof of the Jet Set nightclub, a well-known venue in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic, collapsed during a live performance early Tuesday (April 8). CNN reports at least 27 people have been confirmed dead, with the Associated Press reporting that at least 120 were injured.

	So far, more than 100 people have been rescued, according to CNN, citing Juan Manuel Méndez, director of the Center of Emergency Operations. More than 300 people were inside the club at the time of the roof collapse.

	











	Among the injured is merengue singer Rubby Pérez, who was performing when the roof fell, officials said. The singer is being transferred to the Plaza de la Salud hospital, according to medical director Nepomuceno Mejía.


Billboard Español had reached out to Pérez's management.


	The AP reported that the Pérez's manager, Enrique Paulino, spoke to reporters at the scene about the collapse that happened about an hour after the show began at midnight. Paulino said that Pérez's saxophone player was killed in the incident.


	The authorities said that among the deceased is the governor of Montecristi, Nelsy Milagros Cruz Martinez, according to Dominican newspaper El Día.


	Authorities have launched extensive search and rescue efforts, with the national police sharing on its Instagram account early Tuesday that there have been “101 transfers have been made to different hospital centers in the National District,” noting that “search, rescue and medical assistance” is ongoing in the area, where an estimated 300 people had gathered for the concert.


	“We presume that many of them are still alive, and that is why the authorities here will not give up until not a single person remains under that rubble,” Méndez said of the search for survivors and victims inside the venue, according to the AP.


	“It happened so quickly. I managed to throw myself into a corner,” Paulino told reporters of the rumble that he initially thought was an earthquake. Video taken just before the roof collapse shows Pérez and fans enjoying themselves before a large crash is heard as the clip goes dark.


	Carolina Mejía de Garrigó, the mayor of Santo Domingo, discussed the “terrible tragedy” and the action being taken in messages posted to X. “My deepest sympathy goes out to the families still waiting for news of their loved ones,” she wrote. “Our National District Disaster Prevention, Mitigation, and Response Committee is active and in permanent session. We will continue to make every effort and remain united in prayer.”

	











	President Luis Abinader also wrote on X that all rescue agencies are “working tirelessly” to help those affected. “We deeply regret the tragedy that occurred at the Jet Set nightclub. We have been following the incident minute by minute since it occurred,” he shared.

Good news for fans devouring “The Chicken Sisters” as Hallmark Channel airs its first season, which premiered exclusively on Hallmark+ in the fall of 2024. On April 7, 2025, the network confirmed via Deadline that the star-studded series has been renewed for a second season. Not only that, but the show has a new home and a new Hallmark hunk on board. 

A post shared by David James Elliott (@djameselliott)

As previously reported, the series renewal is no surprise to the cast of “The Chicken Sisters” — led by Lea Thompson (Nancy), Wendie Malick (Gus), Schuyler Fisk (Amanda), and Genevieve Angelson (Mae). They have already reunited in Vancouver to film the new season. On April 4, Angelson posted a photo in her Instagram Stories while getting her hair and makeup done, writing, “and we're back!” 

But according to Deadline, they'll be joined by a new cast member for season 2 — actor David James Elliott, best known for the decade he spent, from 1995 to 2005, starring on “JAG” opposite another Hallmark star, Catherine Bell. Elliott, 64, will play a man from Gus' past who returns to the fictional town of Merinac, Kansas. 

He joins a handful of Hallmark hunks who are part of the cast, including “Ruby Herring Mysteries” alum James Kot, who plays Amanda's husband and new restaurant owner Frank Jr. The first season cast also included “Ride” alum Jake Foy and Ektor Rivera, who co-starred with Lacey Chabert in 2022's “Groundswell,” but their casting for season two hasn't been confirmed yet. 

Based on KJ Dell'Antonia's popular book of the same name, “The Chicken Sisters” follows the drama between two fried chicken restaurants in the same small town, Mimi's and Frannie's. 

The townspeople's loyalty is deeply divided over the restaurants, owned by separate families with complicated ties to each other. The drama is only exacerbated by the arrival of a production crew for the reality TV show “Kitchen Clash.” 

Months after the first season of “The Chicken Sisters” premiered on Hallmark+, where it's still available to stream, the series made its Hallmark Channel debut on March 30, airing on Sunday nights through May 18. According to Deadline, the second season will premiere on Hallmark Channel, with each new episode available to stream the day after it airs. 

In another interesting shift behind the scenes, series co-creator and season one showrunner Annie Mebane has been replaced by Erin Gibson, who was a writer on the first season. 

Samantha DiPippo, senior vice president of programming for Hallmark Media, told Deadline, “We're grateful to Annie Mebane for creating the series for television and expertly bringing to life the town of Merinac and its colorful characters in K.J. Dell'Antonia's beloved book. The show is in great hands with Erin Gibson taking the reins as showrunner this season and we know that our stellar cast … will serve up something special for viewers.”

After Hallmark Channel aired the first episode on March 30, Fisk shared some behind-the-scenes details in her Instagram Stories, including gushing about her castmates. The daughter of Hollywood legend Sissy Spacek, Fisk said it's “a dream to get to act alongside the incredible wendie malick” and called Angelson “the best tv sister” and “the bessssst friend.” 

Of her TV mom, Thompson, Fisk wrote, “i sat next to @lea_thompson at our first table read for the show after basically just meeting her. i was (still am) so in awe of her. she has a poise and strength and a vibe that you just want to be around.”

“The Kingdom” reigned upon Un Certain Regard at Cannes 2024, where it premiered as a sales title before being acquired by Metrograph Pictures. The critically acclaimed “anti-gangster film,” as writer/director Julien Colonna described it, shockingly marks a series of firsts for its cast and crew: “The Kingdom” is Colonna's feature narrative debut (he previously helmed 2019 documentary “Luo Yang's Girls”) and lead stars Ghjuvanna Benedetti and Saveriu Santucci's first times onscreen. 

Benedetti plays Lesia, a teen in 1995 Corsica who has to help her father Pierre-Paul (Saveriu Santucci) escape from the mob that he used to lead. The official synopsis reads: “One day a man bursts into her life and takes her to an isolated villa where she finds her father, in hiding, surrounded by his clan. An underworld war erupts. The noose is tightening around them. Death strikes.

“The Kingdom,” though, is not a mob movie: Colonna instead sought to helm a film that de-stigmatized the “violence” that exists in real life Corsica while also dichotomizing the rebellion of organized crime with the angst of being a teenage girl in a patriarchal society. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






“Through this film I want to show the machinery of thug rule in its inevitable programmed extinction. These men are neither heroized nor sanctified; on the contrary, they are shown as the penitents of their own lives, ghosts of those who are already dead but don't yet know it,” Colonna said in a press statement. “Lesia's fear of seeing her father die at any moment, powerless in the face of the male violence imposed on her, in the face of the carefree childhood slipping away from her. ‘The Kingdom''s narrative perspective is from the level of a child in a man's environment. The point of view is simultaneously immersive yet distanced and depicts a filial relationship trying to exist, to survive in a context where everything dies. The characters' emotional issues can be seen more clearly as I have placed the classic genre film plot – the military chess board, the war of clans and territories – in the background. I wanted to create a space in which to see something else come alive: a story about the consequences of these marginal lives, a more truthful reflection of an environment that is too often treated fantastically, and thus to stake out the boundaries of an anti-gangster film.” 

 










Colonna directed the film from a script he cowrote with Jeanne Herry. Hugo Sélignac and Antoine Lafon produce. 

The IndieWire review for “The Kingdom” noted how the film charted the “gradual transformation of an innocent child into an accessory to violence, forced to become increasingly pragmatic and cold along the way” an entirely “fresh hook” into a crime film that makes the feature a “riveting, moving” movie.

“The Kingdom” premieres May 30 in theaters in NY and LA with a national expansion to follow from Metrograph Pictures. Check out the trailer below.

As the judges on season 23 of “American Idol” used the first-ever Head to Head Duet round to choose their Top 24, online critics were quick to pounce on some of their choices. Most singers ignored the naysayers, but Baylee Littrell's mom immediately defended her son as he advanced in the competition, ready to sing for viewers' votes. 

Baylee, the son of Backstreet Boy Brian Littrell, has been widely scrutinized as a “nepo baby,” with some fans questioning whether he deserves to keep advancing or was chosen because of his famous father. Shortly after the Top 24 episode aired on April 7, 2025, USA Today called the 22-year-old's Head to Head duet his “roughest performance yet” and viewers flooded “Idol's” social media pages asking why he made it through instead of his duet partner, soulful singer Keilene Bultron. 

When “American Idol” posted a photo of the duo performing “Shallow,” disappointed viewers filled the comment section, including one who wrote, “Seriously??!!!!!…. I thought that the judges are in it for real!!… but it's obvious that she sings better than him!!.. did you pass him through just because of who his father is??????? This was very unfair!!!!!!!!”

After Baylee posted a photo of himself outside the Orpheum Theater in Los Angeles to celebrate moving into the Top 24, he got a written pep talk from his mom Leighanne Litrell, who's been seen on the show multiple times cheering Baylee on with his famous dad. 

She wrote, “Love you bub! I love your heart ! I love your song writing , I love your voice! Don't listen to the negative peeps hating on you because of who your dad is You have so many people who love you for who you are and how talented you are! Keep shinning! Keep on keeping on! You have always carved your own path, and will continue too! We are so proud of you!!!!” 

Nearly 100 fans liked Leighanne's comment and multiple people replied with encouraging words, including one who wrote, “exactly agreed! Your son has a beautiful voice and good heart on him you and his dad did a great job raising a nice young man. Rooting for him as well!”

In a separate comment, Leighanne wrote, “Cho Cho babe wish they showed the whole performance!”

Brian also wrote a supportive comment on his son's post, telling him, “Keep chugging Bubba that was a great job…. So much hard work, so very proud of you. 🔥”

Critiquing the duet, judge Lionel Richie noted, “I don't know if it was powerful or too powerful” and while deciding their fates, Bryan said Baylee seemed “real timid” on his verses. In the end,   Bultron was sent home and Underwood told Baylee that though he was going through, it was “not a unanimous decision,” which she said she faced during her own Hollywood Week performances in 2005. 

Underwood told him, “I am your cheerleader, I believe in you, and I had to be very vocal about that … So, moving forward, I need you to step it up!” 

The 24 contestants chosen to advance after Hollywood Week will now head to Disney's Aulani Resort in Hawaii to work with celebrity mentors Ashanti and Josh Groban, as well as new Artist-in-Residence Jelly Roll, as they prepare to perform for a live audience on the outdoor stage “Idol” producers set up there each year. 

Those performances will air on April 13 and 14, giving viewers their first chance to vote for which singers should move on in the competition. Here's a list of the 24 singers — including all three Platinum Ticket recipients — who made it through Hollywood Week:

Paige DeSorbo and Craig Conover's breakup took the Bravo world by surprise. The couple had been together for three years and often discussed their future together on their respective shows. 

Many people had opinions after the news was made public, and they took to social media to express them. However, DeSorbo knew that she had to do the best thing for herself, not worrying about the outside noise. 

“I'm proud of myself for making a tough decision even though the public was like, ‘You're wrong, you'll never find another person again,'” she said in an interview with The New York Times that was published on April 6. 

“I am really thankful for the women that supported me and saw what I was going through,” she added.

DeSorbo and Berner spend a lot of time together, so it's natural that the “Summer House” star would lean on her podcast co-host in the tough moments.  

“It really is true that there is nothing better than your best friend in moments like that,” DeSorbo told The New York Times. “I feel like I was processing the breakup so differently because I had those months where she allowed me to say every single thought that came into my brain about relationships, being someone's wife, being someone's mother. Like I had said everything I could, even I could think in those months. And so then once, like the public found out, I was like, ‘Oh, this is going to be fine.'”

And with that, she's focused on her very successful career. Plus, she gets to do it all alongside her best friend. 

“I definitely feel driven and focused,” DeSorbo explained. “I wanted something, so I'm working toward it.”

“Hitting these milestones in your career is so exciting,” she added. “But hitting them with your best friend is like a different level of happiness.”

“How To Giggle: A Guide to Taking Life Less Seriously” is being released on April 15, 2025. 

“It's for the casual reader,” DeSorbo told The New York Times. “I really pictured the girls like, going on vacation, grabbing this book, throwing it in their bag. Maybe they pick it up on vacation — but maybe they don't even open it.”  This book is an opportunity for DeSorbo and Berner to “share hilarious and heartwarming advice on how to take life a little bit less seriously,” according to Simon and Schuster.

	A stage show that intermingles music and life stories isn't new in rock; just ask Bruce Springsteen and Ray Davies. But Jesse Malin already knows one way in which his first foray into the genre will be set apart from those that came and rocked before.


	“The play opens in the hospital,” Malin says from his East Village home in New York. “And I'm telling somebody what happened to me and that I've canceled tours and haven't played my guitar. There's a guitar next to the bed and a wheelchair, and I'm just thinking about what I'm going to do.”


	Two years ago this month, Malin, a longtime fixture and champion of New York's punk scene, suffered a rare spinal stroke that left him unable to walk. In the agonizing time since, he's endured a regimen of demanding physical therapy, and even stem-cell injections. Musician friends have rallied to his aid, releasing an album of Malin covers (featuring Springsteen, Lucinda Williams, Billie Joe Armstrong, Elvis Costello, and others) and honoring Malin at two tribute concerts at New York's Beacon Theatre last year that brought together Williams, Costello, Counting Crows' Adam Duritz, and more.

	











	Once the Beacon shows were over, however, Malin wasn't sure what was next, especially when it came to paying for medical bills that are not covered by insurance. “After [the tribute shows], I didn't know what else to do,” he says. “I'm thinking I can't tour right now. You don't make money from records. You gotta play live. And a good friend suggested an idea of a residency.”

	That proposal has led to Silver Manhattan, a combination of concert and play that will weave together Malin's music — from his bands Heart Attack and D Generation through his solo records — with tales from his life and career. Opening Sept. 6, the show (written by Malin and produced by Tommy Kriegsmann / ArKtype and David Bason, and presented by Peter Shapiro) will be performed once a month on select Saturdays at New York's Gramercy Theatre: Oct. 4, Nov. 22, Dec. 6, and Jan. 11, 2026, in addition to the September premiere. “I thought, ‘I want to do something where I can work and be in New York,' and we found a theater ten minutes from my house,” says Malin, who needs a walker and cane to take even a short stroll. “I want to tell a story I've always wanted to tell. And now there's this new element into it.”

	Months before his stroke, Malin was indeed already at work on a memoir, for which he had more than enough material, starting with his childhood in Queens, New York. “It was really a story about coming of age in a New York that doesn't exist anymore, growing up in a broken home with a single mom, getting exposed to music at a young age and coming into the city and playing CBGB and putting out my first hardcore single,” he says. “Then touring and learning in the early Eighties about this positive outlook that wasn't the nihilism of the Seventies punk, then forming bands, finding a family in the city of people with similar mindsets and seeing how much music brings people together. It's filled with funny characters, humor and just these struggles. So I started the book, and then this happened.”


	Malin resumed working on his book after the stroke, a process he says he found “sometimes painful, sometimes depressing.” Some of that material will provide the foundation for Silver Manhattan, named after a song on Malin's second solo album, 2004's The Heat. “It's a kind of hybrid play-slash-concert,” he says of the show. “It's not a one-man show. The full band will be up there. Yet there is a story with characters from my childhood up through D Generation. I want to take aspects from the story of my life, the struggles I had to overcome at a young age, and then I'm hit with even more of a challenge at this current point.”


	Messing with the notion of a traditional residency also appealed to Malin. “I just didn't want it to be where I play my songs once a month,” he continues. “That's great for Billy Joel, and I'd love to go see that. But when I was thinking about the idea of making a show, I was very inspired by David Byrne's American Utopia, and how uplifting it was. It had music and stories, and it was presented in a fresh way, and you left there feeling very alive.”

	The precise structure of Silver Manhattan is still being worked out, but at the moment, Malin envisions a show that, after opening in the hospital, will feature him talking about his upbringing and performing at least a dozen songs from his back catalog with his band, with a minimal set and possibly actors portraying people from his life. “It's definitely going to be a show, a concert for my fans, but also a platform and a story. We're going to keep simple and work within our means, which is something I learned from punk rock,” he says. He thinks the show will incorporate sets, but, he adds with a chuckle, “It's not going to be super-elaborate where I'm going to be flying over the audience in a harness or something.”

	











	As the show progresses through his early life and solo career, Malin imagines it will flash-forward — “Goodfellas style,” he says — to his stroke, a subsequent trip to Argentina for stem-cell treatments, and his initial efforts to stand up from his wheelchair and take early steps. “The buildup, the Rocky Balboa of this, is me wanting to get back to my life, which is in front of my audience,” he says. “I'll be trying to make my body do the most I can, and not just sit there and accept that I'm paralyzed with this disability. So when you see the show each night, you'll be seeing that in real action.”


	After two years, Malin still has no feeling in his legs and undergoes regular physical therapy. But the last few months have offered glimmers of hope, especially after he began to focus on building up his calves and hips. “There's some things I see progress in,” he says. “I made it a goal to want to be able to find a way to stand up, even if it was just for a song. To find a way to get my body up onto that mic stand to sing. And we worked at that for six months.”


	That goal was on display at a tribute concert to Patti Smith at Carnegie Hall last month. After arriving onstage in his wheelchair, Malin stood up, clutched the microphone stand, and sang Smith's “Free Money,” a song he picked for the occasion. “I was nervous to get up there and I was trying to get out of a wheelchair and stand up to sing a song like that and make sure I didn't fall,” he recalls. “There's a non-stop barrage of words and no musical breaks.” But he made it through and received a standing ovation. “It really touched my heart,” he says.

	For all its focus on his struggles, Malin hopes Silver Manhattan will also transcend his story. “I don't want to just target my core fans,” he says. “We're here to make sure it's a good time in the end, that it's fun —even though there are a lot of things that happen along the way. I'm not going to run my usual five miles along the water near the Brooklyn Bridge. Every day is a challenge, but I'm going to keep pushing through. That's why I call this ‘a musical guide to survival.'”


Tickets for Silver Manhattan go on sale Friday, April 11 at 12 noon ET, with Citi and Artist presales set for April 9 at 10 a.m. ET (PW: JESSE) and April 10 at 10 a.m. ET through LiveNation (PW: DANCE) and Ticketmaster (PW: SYNC).

Two widely followed Chinese public figures — one an editor for a state media outlet, the other the son of a former party chief — released identical outlines on Tuesday of countermeasures Chinese authorities are said to be considering in response to Trump's tariffs. 


							By 

	Patrick Brzeski


Asia Bureau Chief


	The U.S. film industry so far has escaped direct retaliation from countries hit by President Donald Trump‘s globe-spanning tariffs, thanks to theatrical film releases and streaming platforms being categorized as services rather than physical goods. But Hollywood's luck in China, the world's second-largest film market, could soon run out, according to statements issued Tuesday by two influential public figures in the country. 


	With trade relations between Washington and Beijing spiraling, two widely followed Chinese bloggers posted an identical set of measures that local authorities are said to be mulling in response to Trump's 54 percent tariffs on all Chinese goods, which the president vowed to increase to 104 percent if Beijing didn't back down from a pledge to match the current U.S. tariff rate. The list of mooted moves includes “reducing or banning the import of U.S. films,” as well as increasing tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods and U.S. services, among other countermeasures.

	The potential plans were shared simultaneously over local social media by Liu Hong, a senior editor at the state-backed Xinhua News Agency, and Ren Yi, the influential and widely followed grandson of Ren Zhongyi, former communist party chief of Guangdong Province. Both figures attributed the outlined proposals to unnamed sources familiar with authorities' planning. Bloomberg News was the first Western outlet to cover their statements. 


	The U.S. studios' earnings in China have declined drastically in recent years as local tastes have shifted away from Hollywood franchise spectacle toward the country's homegrown Chinese-language blockbusters. But losing all access to the Chinese market could still ding the studios' bottom lines. Warner Bros. and Legendary's A Minecraft Movie opened in China in first place last weekend with ticket sales of $14.5 million, just over 10 percent of its $144 international earnings haul. In 2024, the biggest U.S. release in the country was Warner Bros. and Legendary's Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire with a hefty $132 million China box office total. 


	Chinese authorities hold a firm grip over every aspect of film distribution in the country and they have worked tirelessly over the years to boost local content at the expense of imported movies. Under former trade agreements, China committed to releasing 34 foreign films per year under revenue-share terms, with overseas studios permitted to a 25 percent share of ticket sales. Other films, usually smaller-budget titles, are imported via a buy-out system, where a local distributor pays a flat fee to release the movie in Chinese theaters. China's film regulators also maintain strict censorship standards for film content and choose the release dates for all movies, reserving the most lucrative holiday windows for local Chinese films.

	











	The film business, though, is one sector where the U.S. maintains a sizable trade surplus with China, as Chinese films, despite their enormous earnings in the home market, have made little headway with mainstream North American moviegoers.

The singer and "The Voice" judge didn't have a lot of specific details on Monday night (April 7), but promised that things are definitely happening.

	First the good news. Adam Levine confirmed on Monday night's (April 7) Tonight Show that Maroon 5 will be be back in our ears this year. The bad news is that, for now, the details are a bit fuzzy. “I am gonna confirm the rumors are true,” Levine said to huge shouts from the studio audience when host Jimmy Fallon asked him if the band is planning to release new music this year.


	“The rumors are correct. There are details. I cannot divulge all the details,” Levine continued cagily. “But the details are basically, roughly, there's a single coming at the end of the month-ish. I'm really excited about it. An album is coming over the summer. Non-specifically around the summertime. And then, even more non-specifically, there is a tour coming in the fall-ish.”

	











	The album, when it comes, will be the follow-up to 2021's Jordi. And the single, when it drops, will be the band's first since 2023's “Middle Ground.”  




			Trending on Billboard		







	Levine also talked about the the first time he worked with producer/songwriter Benny Blanco on the M5 smash “Moves Like Jagger.” The 2011 Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit was co-written and co-produced by Blanco, who Levine described as a “fun… hilarious dude” who was the first person to convince him to write songs on his own away from his M5 bandmates. They talked and Blanco played him a few demos, including “Moves Like Jagger” and another track that went on to be a hit for Gym Class Heroes, “Stereo Hearts.” 


	“He brought those two to me and I was like, ‘Oh this is a lot of fun,'” Levine said. “Having new energy is a great thing… funnily enough, now I've kind of gone back to writing and shutting everybody out. But Benny was the first guy that got me to kind of think outside of the band.”

Jon Stewart took aim at Donald Trump‘s tariffs plan on the latest episode of The Daily Show. 


	He opened the show by noting, “Our economy is in the midst of a beautiful metamorphosis, turning from a simple caterpillar into a dead caterpillar.” The host then introduced a new segment he dubbed “Trade Wars” (same logo as Star Wars), and played a series of news clips outlining the impact of Trump's global tariffs. 


	“This turmoil could have lasting effects on the global economy, on everyday Americans, and most worryingly, the stock portfolios of members of Congress,” Stewart said. “Mr. President, now is the time to soothe a worried nation!”


	Stewart followed with another news clip that detailed a social media post from Trump that read, “Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid. Don't be a PANICAN.” The latter being a new term Trump has created for “weak and stupid people.” 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“‘Panican?' The genius who gave us classics like ‘Sleepy Joe' and ‘Crooked Hillary' just shit out, ‘You're just a panican?'” Stewart replied. “How about ‘hystericrats?' ‘Repussicans?' How about ‘cryin-tologists?' Did the overseas factory you had been sourcing your nicknames from get shut down during the tariff war?”

	











	Trump also posted “Only the weak will fail” on Truth Social, prompting Stewart to quip, “What are you doing? Your economic policy has the same tagline as Season 3 of Squid Game? That's supposed to make us feel better?”


	The late-night host continued that he's concerned about the lack of response from Republicans, who don't seemed fazed by the potential economic ripple effect. “When did the right become so chill?” Stewart wondered. “Aren't you the ‘Bud Light is turning my kids trans' folks? But economic meltdown and you're getting all philosophical?”

	He added, “You are all acting the tariff regime in a tried-and-true remedy. ‘Oh, of course, this is the medicine that's always prescribed!' Except the last time it was tried 100 years ago we had a Great Depression.”


	Stewart closed his monologue by reflecting on the overall issue with the tariff plan. “We continue to blame everybody else in the world that we designed and policed after World War II,” he said. “We're the richest country in the world, ever! We're not the world's victims. If we have inequalities in this country, that's on us. It's not a supply problem, it's not on fair trade for the most part. It's an investment and distribution problem. It's our fucking fault. And it's not saying we can't make adjustments and renegotiate things, but it didn't have to be this reckless. You killed the hostage and then went, ‘Oh, ransom?'”

Luann de Lesseps may be taking a break from “The Real Housewives of New York City,” but she's still booked and busy. 

On April 7, People shared a behind-the-scenes look at de Lesseps' appearance as Noelle Victoria on “Murdoch Mysteries.”

The reality star was dressed in a black and white fur coat with short hair styled in waves. Perched on her head was a black hat that completed her early 1900s look.

“I've done a lot of shows now — I've done some scripted shows like ‘Law & Order,' a lot of reality shows, like the ‘Real Housewives' and ‘Crappie Lake.' So being the drama queen in ‘Murdoch Mysteries ‘is not too far of a cry from the ‘Housewives,' de Lesseps told People.

She also revealed that her character's name was a nod to her children, Noel and Victoria de Lesseps.

Yannick Bisson, who plays Detective William Murdoch, said of de Lesseps, “We got along great, we had some laughs. Then I saw a bunch of pictures back from when we were on set, and I was like, ‘Did we have a special look to each other?'”

“I think the fans will be excited to see me in a different light. To be a part of ‘Murdoch Mysteries,' which is so popular, [is so special],” de Lesseps gushed. The Countess' episode airs on April 7 at 8 p.m. ET.

Luann de Lesseps told the Vancouver Sun on April 3 that she had caught the eyes of “Murdoch Mysteries” producers. 

“I first heard about the opportunity at the meet and greet for my Toronto cabaret show in fall 2023, when two people from ‘Murdoch' approached me about a scripted role,” she revealed.

The “Crappie Lake” star continued, “It was a brief conversation, but they followed up with my team months later after the series was renewed for its 18th season.”

“The timing aligned with my tour schedule, so when I returned to Toronto for my Christmas show late last year, I used my day off to stick around and film the scene they had written for me,” de Lesseps added.

A post shared by CBC (@cbc)

On the day of de Lessep's “Murdoch Mysteries” episode, CBC shared a clip on Instagram of the reality star in character, and fans shared their excitement.

“I smell an Emmy,” one replied. Another referenced de Lesseps' song and wrote, “This is so chic! C'est la vie!”

One fan commented, “Is there anything The Countess can't do?!!! Love you, Lu!!!”

“The Real Housewives of Miami” star, Marysol Patton, simply wrote, “Bravo.”

Amadou Bagayoko, the award-winning Malian singer and guitarist in the husband-and-wife duo Amadou & Mariam, has died, according to the Associated Press. In a local televised broadcast, Mali's Minister of Culture Mamou Daffé revealed that Bagayoko died on Friday (April 4) in his hometown of Bamako. He was 70.

Alongside his wife Mariam Doumbia, Bagayoko found international success creating music as Amadou & Mariam. The two combined traditional African instruments with more Western-inspired rock, pop, and blues in the hopes of making Malian music universal. On some records, that meant invoking their regional sounds through creative methods, like playing electric guitar as if it were the ngoni, a West African stringed instrument. Over the course of their multiple decades-long career, they more than succeeded at their goal, performing around the world with artists like Stevie Wonder and U2, recording lauded collaborations with Santigold and TV on the Radio, and earning high-profile awards in the music industry.

Born in October 1954, Bagayoko lost his vision due to a congenital cataract at age 15 and began studying at Mali's Institute for the Young Blind. It was there that he met Doumbia, who went blind at age five, and they bonded over their shared love of music while performing at the institute's Eclipse Orchestra. After getting married in 1980, the two formally kicked off their band Mali's Blind Couple, recording blues songs in the regional Mali style. They relocated to Côte d'Ivoire a few years later and switched to more lo-fi, stripped-back arrangements on guitar and vocals under the moniker Amadou & Mariam, recording songs on cassette tapes in the '80s and '90s. It was there that they crossed paths with Stevie Wonder, who invited them to start playing festivals outside of Africa.

In 1996, Amadou & Mariam moved to Paris and signed to the record label Emarcy. Sou Ni Tile, their first studio album recorded outside of Africa and their debut on the label, came out in 1998 and found considerable success on Parisian radio with the single “Je Pense à Toi.” The duo rolled out three more albums before catching the attention of Latin star Manu Chao, who offered to produce their 2004 record Dimanche à Bamako, their breakout LP and highest-charting album in numerous countries. Amadou & Mariam followed it up with three more full-length records: 2008's Welcome to Mali, 2012's Folila, and 2017's La Confusion.

As their music crossed over to other countries, so did their touring routes. Amadou & Mariam booked sets at U.S. festivals like Coachella and Lollapalooza, landed opening slots for historic gigs like Blur's massive 2009 reunion shows in Hyde Park, and got invites to perform on TV shows like Late Night With Jimmy Fallon.

Amadou & Mariam's music earned them numerous awards over the years, including a nomination for Best Contemporary World Music Album with Welcome to Mali at the 2010 Grammy Awards. The duo won awards for Dimanche à Bamako and Folila at France's Victoire de la Musique, as well as a BBC Radio Awards trophy for World Music thanks to Dimanche à Bamako. Though not a physical award, Bagayoko's final performance with Doumbia certainly felt like a gold trophy, as it took place at one of the biggest stages imaginable: the closing ceremony of the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games.

By bringing those records to life with live performances around the globe, Bagayoko helped play a big role in broadening the global reception to Malian music, a long-term goal of his with the band. “Part of what helped the growth of Mali's music industry is that musicians participated in international festivals. Malian musicians like to listen to a lot of music and they're interested in other music. They have a lot of courage. We and others were influenced and encouraged by other Malian musicians such as Ali Farka Toure and Oumou Sangare,” he said in a 2006 interview with Pitchfork. “We're enjoying our success, but we'd like to make our music more well known, and we're trying to spread it as much as we can.”

Actor Kevin Bacon has not spoken much about Bernie Madoff since he and his wife were victims in the Ponzi scheme that led to Madoff's arrest in 2008.

However, in an interview with Esquire that was published on April 4, they asked if it was okay to discuss Madoff.  

“There's not that much to say, really,” Bacon answered. “If it seems too good to be true, then it's too good to be true.” 

The interviewer followed that up by noting that Bacon and his wife, Kyra Sedgwick appeared to be not “too jaded from the experience”

 “No, not jaded,” he answered. “More careful. But not jaded.”

“I go to this gym. It has a few machines and only a handful of people there at any given time. There's no showers, it's very bare bones,” he added. “But there's a leg press machine. A leg press can be brutal… The machine is right next to a window, and when I look out that window, I'm looking right at the building where Madoff was.” 

“I'm in excruciating pain, doing the leg press, staring out that window,” Bacon continued. “It's perfect, in a funny way, because I also have to think, I can get through this. And that's how we felt about Madoff.

Bacon has never revealed the exact amount he lost to Madoff, but Madoff's Ponzi scheme is said to have defrauded people of an estimated $64.8 billion total. 

While it was a very tough time for Bacon after they learned they had been defrauded by Madoff, he leaned on his family to help him get through it. 

“It sucked, and we were certainly angry and all the things,” Bacon explained to Esquire. “But then we woke up the next day and said, ‘What do we got? We love each other. We love our children. We're healthy. No one took away our ability to make a living.' So we got back to work.”

In 2022, Bacon appeared on the Smartless podcast, hosted by Jason Batemen, Will Arnett, and Sean Hayes, and opened up about how he was impacted by Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. 

Specifically, Bacon revealed that he and Sedgwick “had most of our money in Madoff” and admitted that he received a “portion” of the losses returned, but not everything.

“Certainly, you get angry and stuff, but I have to say, there were a lot of people who were much worse off than we were – old people, people whose retirement funds were completely decimated,” Bacon said on Smartless. “So there's always going to be somebody that's going to have it a lot worse than you.”

With season three now over, the actress can finally talk about her character's fate, and the heartache that accompanied it.  


							By 

	Lacey Rose


Writer-At-Large


[This story contains major spoilers from The White Lotus season three finale, “Amor Fati.”]


Aimee Lou Wood watched the season 3 finale of The White Lotus for the first time last night just like the rest of us.




	But unlike those who are seemingly outraged by her character's fate, she's at peace with it. In fact, when Mike White was suddenly second guessing the decision to have the ever-hopeful Chelsea meet her demise — caught in the middle of a shootout that claimed the lives of several at the resort— including her soulmate, Rick, played by Walton Goggins, Wood was the one who pushed him to stay the course.

	On Monday afternoon, Wood spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about those conversations with White as well as the reasons why she feels strongly Chelsea is not a victim and reveals a few powerful scenes that none of us will ever see.


	***


It was awfully prescient to have photographed you lying flat on your back as part of our recent cover shoot, no?


	I loved that because I obviously knew and they were like, “It would be quite cool if she was lying down,” and I was like, “Yeah, yeah, I think that would be really cool.” I was so keen to do the “dead Barbie.”


Little did we know…


	And that's what was so funny. I was like, “Ooh, I'm playing with fire here.”


At the time, you also said, “I still can't believe that my character, in a way, got her happy ending, in a really fucked up way.” That's how you felt?


	Yeah.


Unpack that a little more.


	People love Chelsea and now they're angry that she was put in harm's way by Rick. But she was not put in harm's way by Rick, she was put in harm's way by herself. So, she's not a victim, she's like many of the tragic heroines that I adore. I was actually listening to Amy Winehouse the whole time I was there. And so we love these incredible women, and I'm not denying that they were not treated well because they did have grumpy men that were shit to them, right?


Oh, absolutely.


	But they're also strong, tenacious, determined women. Even if Rick had bundled Chelsea into a car and sent her to the furthest away place that he could find, she would find her way back. She'd run back. And that is a very addict quality, and Chelsea is an addict — she's a love addict and she didn't defeat her addiction. It's like she's made Rick her higher power, she's made the relationship her higher power, and she sees God in that moment where he says, “Yes, that's the plan.” And in that moment, they've gone from addictive relationship to connected relationship and that's what we've wanted all along. We've wanted it to be not a power dynamic, but a connected horizontal relationship, but of course, in classic Rick and Chelsea fashion, it can only last for one night …

	











Because both of them are addicts?


	Yes. Rick has made his pain his higher power, or the revenge his high power. So, they're both trapped. And Chelsea thinks that fate is external, but it's internal. It's her stuff that she hasn't faced. It's her unhealed shit. It's not big forces outside of her pushing her to Rick; it's big forces inside of her pushing her to Rick. But she doesn't look inside. She pretends to, she says that she reads these books. But then Saxon [played by Patrick Schwarzenegger] tries to look inside her and she can't do it. She chucks those books at him and says, “Here, read these.” It's all the stuff that she uses to deflect: the spirituality, the zodiacs. It's: don't look at me, look at this. And you can really see it in that moment where Saxon came and sat on the beach with her and he's gone and read the book. Do you think that if she'd said to Rick, “I need you to read this book for me,” he would have done it?


Not a chance.


	It's never going to be read. But Saxon takes it, and he reads it — he's still reading it on the boat home. That end shot of him is him reading that book, which kills me. Because he's looking at her and he's listening to her. He's not saying she's stupid, he's not shutting her down, but then she sees Rick and she runs to him. She literally runs towards her fate. So, that's what she wants. And actually, it's patronizing in a way to make it out like she doesn't have any agency — that Rick is the one who's caused all the problems. It's like, they're both colluding in this thing. Even Patrick saying, “Why did Saxon not take a bullet for Chelsea?” He was so upset that Saxon doesn't take a bullet. He was like, “Why didn't Mike write it so that Saxon jumps in front, so Chelsea could live?” It's like everyone wants to save Chelsea.

	











But …


	But she can only save herself. I do think she does live on in Saxon though. He doesn't get Chelsea, but he's going to internalize everything that she taught him and he's going to live with that. Like Mike says, the reading of the book at the end is very hopeful because it's saying that he might use everything [he's learned], and it's very rare for a White Lotus character to actually change that much.


Tell me more about the experience of filming that final, fatal scene, and the conversations you had with Mike White about it?


	It was Mike [who] a few times was like, “Am I doing the wrong thing?”


Jennifer Coolidge famously tried to talk him out of killing Tanya, her character. Did you do the same?


	No. I said, “Actor Aimee wants to be in another season….” Actually, today, I saw [someone say that] maybe Chelsea could be Saxon's imaginary friend in season four, and I was like, “I'm up for that.” She's like his inner voice. But I was like, “Chelsea has to die, Mike. Chelsea and Rick have to die. They have to.” But, yeah, he was the one who started to wobble on the choice. He was like, “But she's hope and I'm killing hope.” And this is also Mike expressing himself through all these characters, and if I'm the hopeful, optimistic part of him and he then has to kill it, that must feel pretty terrible. But it's not the same as killing Tanya because there are some traits in Tanya that you might want to kill off … (Laughs.)

	











That seems fair to say.


	Whereas with Chelsea, you don't want to kill the hopeful, tenacious, heart of the story. But it had to be her or it had to be Rick and Chelsea because, by Mike doing that, he's given Chelsea the status of the mystic that she thinks she is. She says that things happen in threes, that Rick and Chelsea will be together forever, that she's going to follow him into the next life — so, by giving her the death, Mike is giving her what she wants, which is being right. And people will say, “Well, what she wants is just Rick to show up for her,” but I don't know if that is true. I think that a part of her does, the evolved part of her, but the un-evolved part of her, the one who hasn't done the work, who hasn't gone to therapy, who hasn't looked inside, she just wants to be right and she gets proven right.


As Mike has acknowledged, there's a lot on the cutting from floor. What didn't we see?


	Oh, a lot had to be cut. I mean, I think it was like half-an-hour of every episode.


What from the end didn't we see?


	There was this beautiful scene with Rick and Chelsea that didn't make it into the final episode, and I completely get why it didn't because it would've been a double beat. But there was a scene where they're back in the bedroom, and she asks him if he did anything bad [while he was away], and he says no, and she knows that he's telling the truth and she's very happy and joyful. And then she says, “This year's my Saturn return, so it's either going to be the best or the worst year, and I think it's going to be the best, don't you?” And he says, “I do.” And then he picks her up and he kisses her and he puts her on the bed. And it was beautiful, but if we'd had that, then the scene where he says, “That's the plan” wouldn't have been as special. So, I know why it had to go. There was lots of Rick and Chelsea stuff that didn't make it…

	











What else?


	In the first drafts of the script, before it was me playing Chelsea and Walton playing Rick, Chelsea talked about things like his money more. She'd be like, “Oh, it's okay when you spend money, but not when I spend money,” and he's like, “Yeah, because it's my money and you're not my wife.” And she's like, “But we're soulmates; that's what you said in Cancun.” And he says, “But we were on meth.” There was way more like that, but it was cut because we can't have anyone doubt, even for a second, that Chelsea loves Rick. It's also why sometimes I feel quite bad for Rick because there were other moments where Chelsea fucking gives it to him and those big, fucking gnarly arguments didn't make it in either. And I think that if they had, people would've seen their relationship as more equal and hated on Rick less, but, at the same time, their death and their fate, Rick and Chelsea, it had to be a love story.


Walton wasn't at the finale event last night. He's said that he watched the episode alone, which was part of his grieving process. I believe last night was the first time you watched it, and you did so with the rest of the cast. How are you feeling about that decision and the experience?


	I'm going to watch it alone as well. But I'm so glad I made that decision because of the catharsis.


It was cathartic for you?


	Yeah. Seeing Patrick's hand come across the thing to hold mine, and the gasp in the room when it went to Chelsea and there's blood there. I think just being part of the collective, which is so important to me, getting to end that journey with my friends, who are now my family. And I was getting overwhelmed when it was coming out. I was saying, “I don't think I want to do any of the press, I don't think I want to go anywhere,” which is why the coming to L.A. was such a big thing for me. But Michelle [Monaghan] had been like, “Understand the assignment,” and last night, everyone understood the assignment. I sat there and I could see them all, and then there was a moment after [the episode aired], where Jon [Gries] and I just held hands and cried. Then we had to do a panel after! We were like, “How are we expected to speak right now?!” And I was sad that Walton wasn't there because it was something that we did together but also it's so fucking Rick and Chelsea. Like, of course Walton had to watch it alone and of course I had to watch it in the group because there is so much Aimee in Chelsea and so much Walton in Rick.

	











I suppose it's a bit of life imitating art or art imitating life…


	It is. And I think both of us are feeling a similar thing today of, “Okay, I can let go of the parts of this character, of Chelsea, that have been holding me back and I can grow up in the way that Chelsea couldn't.” And at the same time, all the bits that I love about her, I can take with me. So, there's this weird feeling today of rebirth, and I'm sure that Walton feels the same about Rick because it's like, whatever the fuck was going on in him, that was Rick, and he can let go of it now. Like Chelsea says, “You're free. It's a new day.” And it's true. It feels like today is the first new day that I've had in a very long time. Because this journey has felt so long — and the weekly thing, I love it, but it's meant that I'm still in it. But now I feel like I've been released and it's sad, but it's also like, I'm free to be Aimee again.

The legend of the Bell Witch claims that more than 200 years later, her reign of terror continues in Tennessee.

About a 40-minute drive from Nashville, Tennessee, in the city of Adams, where you'll find some intriguing stories of a cursed land and a woman who is said to have returned to the same property that she haunted more than two centuries ago.

On that property is the Bell Witch Cave, which is said to be inhabited by the infamous Bell Witch, a spirit who tormented a farmer and his family in the early 1800s. The lore of the Bell Witch says that she vowed to return to the area, and according to many locals and paranormal investigators, she has made good on that promise and returned to the area.

Legend says farmer John Bell, and his family were tormented by the Bell Witch for years at their Tennessee home. According to the legend, the Bell Witch took responsibility for John Bell's death, which made Tennessee the only state to recognize a death due to the supernatural.

Over the years, the Bell Witch Cave has played host to many curious tourists and offers tour options if you're brave enough.  Even Ghost Adventures has made a stop in Tennessee to attempt to catch a glimpse of the Bell Witch.

Legends say that the Bell Witch stayed true to her word and returned to the area to continue her reign of terror.  Do you think she is still there?  Well, now you can find out, by joining a paranormal investigation.

The Black Wolf Paranormal will be hosting a public investigation of the Bell Witch Cave, and you are invited to attend. This will be the first public investigation of the year, and you can help them get the season off to an exciting start by joining in on the action.

The event will start May 10th at 7 PM and last until 1 AM. You're asked to wear good walking shoes as you'll be investigating 3 separate locations on the property, including the Bell Witch Cave, Native grounds, and a replica cabin.  If this sounds like your kind of adventure, you can learn more here.

NASA astronaut Don Pettit captured breathtaking video of a rare atmospheric phenomenon from his perch high above Earth on the International Space Station.

While the International Space Station (ISS) was orbiting above South America, Pettit recorded what are known as Transient Luminous Events, or TLEs. These are bright, colorful flashes of light faster than lightning and are sometimes referred to as "sprites."

Pettit was able to view the sprites from directly above, looking down at what is known as the nadir, the point directly below a particular location. "OK, this is kind of out there and caters to your inner Uber-Geek," Pettit posted to X (formerly Twitter along with the video. "Nadir view of Transient Luminous Events (TLE ) or upper atmospheric lightning."

The video captures around six seconds of sprites over the Amazon basin. And it's not the first time these phenomena have been caught on camera from the ISS.

In 2024, NASA astronaut Matthew Dominick caught a glimpse at one of the most elusive atmospheric phenomena known as red sprites. These occur during particularly powerful thunderstorms and travel upwards into the atmosphere, as opposed to normal lightning which travels downward to the surface of Earth.

Sprites like the ones Pettit captured on video occur much higher than regular lightning. Their name is an acronym, short for stratospheric perturbations resulting from intense thunderstorm electrification.

Sprites are created when electrical discharges created by lightning shoot upward, creating bursts of plasma in the ionosphere, found around 50 miles (80 km) above Earth's surface. They were not captured on camera until 1989.

Video footage captured by NASA's Perseverance rover shows a small "dust devil" merging with a much larger twister on the surface of Mars.

NASA's Perseverance rover recently had a front-row seat to a rare case of Martian cannibalism: It filmed a massive, swirling "dust devil" engulfing a smaller twister on the Red Planet.

The roaming robot captured the epic encounter on Jan. 25, on the 1,399th sol (Martian day) of its mission. In the video, a smaller devil, which is barely visible in the images, follows in the wake of a larger twister (moving from left to right), before getting too close and being sucked into the larger vortex. The rover was around 0.6 mile (1 kilometer) from the pair when this happened.

The larger devil is estimated to measure around 210 feet (65 meters) wide, while the smaller cone appears to be just 16 feet (5 m) across. It is unclear how tall they were as they were cut off by the rover's field of view. However, a dust devil previously filmed by Perseverance — and with a width almost identical to the larger devil — was predicted to be around 1.2 miles (2 km) tall, or around five times taller than the Empire State Building.

"Convective vortices — aka dust devils — can be rather fiendish," Mark Lemmon, a Perseverance senior research scientist with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado, said in a NASA statement. "These mini-twisters wander the surface of Mars, picking up dust as they go and lowering the visibility in their immediate area."

It is very rare for two dust devils to collide with one another, but when it happens, there are two possible outcomes: "If two dust devils happen upon each other, they can either obliterate one another or merge, with the stronger one consuming the weaker," Lemmon said.

"If you feel bad for the little devil in our latest video, it may give you some solace to know the larger perpetrator most likely met its own end a few minutes later," he added. "Dust devils on Mars only last about 10 minutes."

The largest devil was likely spinning at a max speed of more than 10 mph (16 km/h), based on data collected from previous sightings.

Dust devils are formed by warm air rising from the planet's sun-heated surface. As the air rises, cooler air rushes down to replace it, which is then heated and rises again. This cycle creates a column of rising air that starts to spin increasingly quickly. This phenomenon also occurs on Earth, though the results are usually far less dramatic.

"When the incoming air rises into the column, it picks up speed like a spinning ice skater bringing their arms closer to their body," NASA representatives wrote in the statement. "The air rushing in also picks up dust, and a dust devil is born."



When the new video was taken, Perseverance was deliberately scouring the horizon in search of the spinning devils to help gather data that can help researchers learn more about this phenomenon.

"Dust devils play a significant role in Martian weather patterns," Katie Stack Morgan, a project scientist for the Perseverance rover at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in the statement.

Studying them is important because "these phenomena indicate atmospheric conditions, such as prevailing wind directions and speed, and are responsible for about half the dust in the Martian atmosphere," she added.

NASA's Viking orbiters captured the first-ever images of Martian dust devils in the 1970s, as the spacecraft spied the swirling structures from space.

However, Perseverance has captured some of the best videos of these mini-twisters, including a swarm of around a dozen funnels in July 2021. The rover also captured the first audio recording of a Martian dust devil in September 2021.

When we entered the premises of Ajabgarh on a sunny Friday afternoon, I knew little about Bhangarh, the "in"-famous curse, and the history of this place in the foothills of the Aravallis. As a blurry Ajabgarh Fort came into view, I knew there were stories waiting there.

Rajasthan's Ajabgarh, located in the Alwar district, is no Jaipur, Udaipur or Jaisalmer. An abandoned village, a cursed place, a mysterious palace - this lesser-known stony region has everything that might go against the traditional ideas of tourism. But trust a new luxury resort to change all of that.

Spread across 30 acres of pristine land, Ananta Spa & Resort is trying to rebuild the image of a once-"haunted" area, known for its negative energy.

Bhangarh and Ajabgarh are spoken of in the same breath. Situated in the Rajgarh area, in the Alwar district of Rajasthan, Bhangarh Fort lies just at the border of the Sariska Tiger Reserve. Ajabgarh is the neighbouring village, and comes with a fort of its own.

Bhangarh and Ajabgarh were tied together by the same curse. Ajabgarh, says the local folklore, was deserted overnight around the same time that Bhangarh was "cursed".

Two main legends explain the Bhangarh-Ajabgarh "curse". The first goes: A sage, Guru Balu Nath, told the Bhangarh maharaja that no shadow should fall on his home. When columns were added to the Bhangarh Fort, the sage's home was in the dark. He cursed the twin villages of Bhangarh and Ajabgarh, and both were deserted.

The second, and more interesting story, is that a black magician fell in love with the Bhangarh princess. She did not like him or his love potion. When she threw the love potion away, a rock crushed the black magician to death. However, not without a curse. The black magician's curse led to the royal family, along with the entire village, leaving Bhangarh. Ajabgarh followed suit.

A "haunted" place isn't quite the location of choice for a luxury resort. So, why Ajabgarh?

Ananta Spa & Resort director Ashutosh Goyal tells NDTV, "Consumers are always attracted to places that are out of the box. If you give them something unique, they will be attracted; that's what we have seen at our previous properties [Ananta has a chain of luxury properties around India, from Ranthambore to Pushkar]. We also want to educate people on Ajabgarh," says Goyal.

"Everything has a cycle. This region has a lot of negative energy. But in history, rajas and maharajas lived here. Jaipur or Udaipur was not the hub. It's Ajabgarh that the rajas chose as their base. After the Bhangarh curse, people started to move out. A curse persisted for a few years. Now, the time has come to make people aware of the positive energy of the place," says Goyal.

So, we set out for ourselves to see the "negative energies" and the luxury resort trying to combat it.

The vastness of the property was overwhelming. Sprawling over 30 acres, the resort boasts of beauty, aesthetics and sustainable consumption, all in the same place.  

The lush green, the flowers in and around the villas, the blue sky - all seemed to be waiting to welcome us.

The ornate chandelier at the reception, the high ceilings (which is a special feature in the Bamboo Villas - more on that later) and the general architecture of the resort captivated our attention.

For its villas, Ananta picks elements of nature, blending luxury with earthiness, and the contemporary with the ancient. Here's a lowdown on the four kinds of villas at the property. 

Fire Villas: These villas, inspired by the Rajasthani Jhopda and spanning 800 sq ft each, showcases bold architecture inspired by cubist forms and the vibrant reds of Gulmohar trees. Their interiors pulse with energy, offering sleek, minimalist designs accented with fiery hues.

● Earth Villas: Inspired by Rajasthani Bhonga houses, these villas are 1,650 sq ft each, with circular mud structures and conical thatched roofs. The Earth Villas are the most expensive ones from among the Ananta Ajabgarh offering.

The villas come with a private, open-air jacuzzi.

● Bamboo Villas: Featuring minimalist architecture with bamboo-inspired accents and tropical greenery, they provide a calming, natural retreat.

Bamboo Villa, like the name says, has bamboo as its key highlight. From the interiors to the furniture, the Bamboo Villas are crafted in wood and bamboo.

● Lagoon Villas: Elevated on pillars, they offer uninterrupted views of serene koi-filled ponds and flourishing lilies, creating an idyllic lagoon-like experience.

What we liked the most about these Villas is a sense of place. Unlike the box apartments we are used to seeing in big cities, the sense of space here in Ajabgarh also reiterates the ideas of freedom, relief from boredom and the mundaneness of city life.

From Ananta Spa & Resorts, you can go for a Somsagar Lake trek (half-hour drive), and a jungle safari in the Sariska Tiger Reserve (one hour by road).

At the break of dawn on Saturday, we tried our luck spotting a leopard or a tiger in Sariska. The last time I was here, a leopard was kind enough to grace us with a visit. However, this time around, no such luck.

We did spot some other animals and birds too.

Peacocks and sambar deer greeted us during our trip. The leopards and tigers chose to stay away. We only had a stray call here and there to get our hopes high (in vain).

The beauty of a jungle safari lies in its unpredictability. We ended ours with the hope of a next time.

The Oasis restaurant, curated by executive chef Laveen Mathur, delivers an exceptional farm-to-table dining experience.

● Authentic Rajasthani classics like Dal Baati Churma, Laal Maas, and Ker Sangri are prepared with age-old recipes and with the finest ingredients.● Signature creations like Khad Murgh are slow-cooked underground for its distinct smoky flavour, and Gulkand Gulab Ki Kheer, an heirloom dessert of the Ajabgarh royals.● Global cuisines featuring pan-Asian, Mediterranean, and Continental specialities, including Khow Suey, the refreshing Som Tam Salad, and lavish English breakfasts.

We were treated to an authentic Rajasthani thali

A tour of the whole property is an exercise in itself. If you don't want to chill in your cosy room, try out their swimming pool or a drink at the Float Bar.

There's also a cycling track that you can take a bicycle out on.

One of the highlights of our trip was a book-reading session by author Tripti Pandey, a cultural ambassador of Rajasthan. Pandey read out excerpts from her book, The Half Empress.

Pandey's book is historical fiction, about the courtesan Raskapoor, the daughter of a Muslim mother and a Brahmin father. Raskapoor was a celebrity prisoner at the famous Nahargarh Fort, who was called The Half Empress by Sawai Jagat. Pandey's book is a fictional version of the life of Raskapoor.

Our two-day stay included a tour of the Ajabgarh village, where the women weave carpets and make brooms from date leaves.

We also visited the decades-old Raghunath Temple.

With the setting sun behind us, we visited the chhatri where the rajas used to entertain their guests over lunch and dinner. Guests have the option of choosing a specially curated breakfast under the chhatri.

Ananta's wellness programme included a sound-healing session, a welcome break from our chaotic city lives.

After two days of Ajabgarh, it's the stories and the myths that stay with you, the experience apart. 

What's the truth of Ajabgarh? What actually happened? To seek those answers, we would probably need to visit Ajabgarh once more.

Researchers bombarded lichens with a year's worth of Martian radiation in just 5 hours — and they survived, hinting that the extremophiles could potentially live on the Red Planet.

Earth-based lifeforms known as lichens may be tough enough to survive on Mars, a new study suggests.

Scientists came to this conclusion after blasting the lichens with a year's worth of Martian radiation in less than a day during a lab experiment — and the terrestrial lifeforms survived the process.

Mars is not an easy place to live. The Red Planet is essentially one giant desert with a minimal atmosphere, low temperatures and no liquid water at its surface. But the biggest barrier to life on Mars is the lack of a strong magnetic field, which protects against the constant bombardment of ionizing radiation from cosmic rays and solar flares, which can damage living cells and mutate their DNA.

One group of living things that may be able to survive these extreme conditions is lichens, symbiotic associations between fungi and photosynthetic bacteria and/or algae. These hybrid lifeforms, which are not considered true organisms but are listed as species on the three of life, work together to stay alive and many are extremophiles, capable of tolerating no hydration and extreme temperatures for long periods. Some species have even survived being directly exposed to the vacuum of space.

In the new study, published March 31 in the journal IMA Fungus, researchers tested how two lichen species — Diploschistes muscorum and Cetraria aculeata — reacted to ionizing radiation under Martian conditions. To do this, the team placed the lifeforms in a specialized vacuum chamber at the Space Research Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, which replicated the atmospheric pressure, temperatures and composition on the Red Planet. They bombarded the lichens with a year's worth of Martian radiation in just 5 hours. Both species were able to remain metabolically active throughout the tests.

"These findings expand our understanding of biological processes under simulated Martian conditions and reveal how hydrated organisms respond to ionizing radiation," Kaja Skubała, a researcher at the Institute of Botany at the Jagellonian University in Krakow, Poland, said in a statement. "Ultimately, this research deepens our knowledge of lichen adaptation and their potential for colonizing extraterrestrial environments."

Of the two species, D. muscorum showed the greatest resistance to the radiation, sustaining less damage to its cells, which suggests that some lichens will be better suited to Martian conditions than others. However, it is unlikely that any species would be able to survive on Mars unattended for long periods, as there is no known liquid water at the surface, which all of Earth's lifeforms need to survive.

This is the reason why it is unlikely that there is any extraterrestrial life currently alive on Mars.

According to the researchers, the new experiments show that lichens are prime candidates for being taken on future Mars missions, although there are several resilient species other than D. muscorum that could also make the trip.

But lichens are not the only lifeforms that could potentially survive on the Red Planet.



One extremophile group that has long been considered as future Martian tourists is tardigrades. These microscopic critters are nearly indestructible and can survive extreme temperatures, crushing pressures, total dehydration and the vacuum of space, largely thanks to an ability to switch off their metabolism and enter a state of suspended animation.

Other candidates include mosses — plants with similar abilities to lichens. Some desert moss species have even been shown to be resilient to gamma rays and liquid nitrogen, hinting that they too could fare well on Mars.

—Longest molecules ever found on Mars may be remnants of building blocks of life

Single-celled microorganisms, such as bacteria, might also be able to survive on Mars if they were sheltered from radiation, living underground. Research has shown that these microbes could also survive for hundreds of millions of years beneath the surface in a hibernation-like state.

However, the first terrestrial lifeforms to touch down on Mars will likely be a species that is naturally very poorly suited to living on Mars — humans. NASA intends on launching the first crewed mission to the Red Planet sometime in the 2030s, when they will get a taste of how tough it is to survive there.

Social signals stop young labyrinth spiders from hunting their siblings even when they are starving. However, the cannibalistic spiderlings quickly feed on the corpses of their brothers and sisters.

Young cannibalistic spiders give off social signals that stop siblings from eating each other alive, a new study finds. But the corpses of fallen brothers and sisters are fair game.

Labyrinth spiders (Agelena labyrinthica) live across Europe and spend most of their lives alone, dining on small insects and, if the opportunity arises, other labyrinth spiders. However, despite their cannibalistic tendencies, labyrinth spiderlings are content to share a web with their siblings at a young age.

In a new study, published in the April volume of the journal Animal Behaviour, researchers put spider sibling tolerance to the test by depriving lab-reared labyrinth spiderlings of food. The researchers wanted to see whether the hungry spiderlings would turn on each other, but, to the researchers' surprise, the spiderlings remained civil.

"Spiders, even when starving, can be highly tolerant of their living siblings, with strong signals that prevent cannibalism," study authors Antoine Lempereur, a doctoral student, and Raphaël Jeanson, a senior researcher, both at the University of Toulouse in France and the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), told Live Science in an email.

However, these signals only appear to be active while the spiders are alive, because the spiderlings happily fed on their brothers and sisters once they were dead, according to the study.

Labyrinth spiders live in webs with intricate tunnel systems, or labyrinths. Females lay and hatch their eggs — up to 130 of them — in the central chamber of these webs during the summer. The resulting hatchlings remain in the web with their mother over winter, before emerging in spring, according to the Southwick Country Park Nature Reserve in England, which is home to labyrinth spiders.

The spiderlings initially live off egg yolk from the eggs they're born in, which is kept in their abdomens, and will eat their mother if she dies. However, they can also catch flies within days of hatching, so they're capable of hunting at a young age.

To learn more about why siblings aren't hostile to one another, Lempereur and Jeanson collected labyrinth spider egg sacs in southwest France and hatched them in a lab. Some of the spiders were kept in groups of four, while others were kept alone. None of the spiders were fed during the experiment, and after 20 days, the researchers started putting two hungry spiders into small plastic "arenas" to see how they would interact, according to the study.

The spiderlings raised in groups were significantly less aggressive to one another than the spiders raised alone, something Jeanson has already demonstrated in previous studies. The researchers suggested this is because social isolation reduces sensitivity to social signals.

"In short, a spider living alone has no reason to respond to cues emitted by other spiders, as it will never encounter them again, except during reproduction when other signals, such as sexual pheromones, come into play," Lempereur and Jeanson said.

While the group-reared spiders were typically not hostile to each other, they fed on their dead siblings just as quickly as the socially isolated spiders, which the researchers said was surprising for two reasons.

"First, spiders are typically predators of living prey rather than dead prey," Lempereur and Jeanson said. "Second, and more importantly, as shown in our previous work, spiders can tolerate living siblings for weeks but will consume dead siblings within an hour of their death."

Lempereur and Jeanson wrote in the study that living siblings could be sending a "life signal" to one another through chemicals, which is one of the ways spiders communicate. The researchers will now investigate the makeup of this signal.

Today, Peace Is Loud and UFO announce the Peace is Loud x UFO Post/Impact Residency, which combines more traditional residency perks of a post-production workspace and support with impact strategizing. The pilot residency went to Wood Street, directed by Caron Creighton, which “follows members of Oakland's Wood Street homeless encampment as they organize against dual evictions from both the city and state,” according to the organizations' press release.

Both Peace Is Loud and UFO have track records supporting under-resourced filmmakers. The details of the month-long residency at the Silver Sun Foundation in Woodstock, NY, included private live/work space equipped with an edit suite, compensated time to focus on the film, technical support, feedback from an experienced editor. The tailored 1:1 impact support to advance impact fundraising, the development of an impact campaign, and care for the film's participants included four weekly sessions with Creighton and producer Estevan Padilla, hosted by the Peace Is Loud team. In addition to the residency, Wood Street (which is fiscally-sponsored by IDA) will receive a US$10,000 unrestricted grant. 

UFO is known for its 18-month intensive for shorts filmmakers, the UFO Shorts Film Lab, and unique collaborations with other documentary film support organizations. UFO Co-Director Arno Morkros says: “We are honored to have such incredible partners in our colleagues at Peace Is Loud—by combining forces, we have created a unique residency model that invests in a film's capacity for impact.”

Echoing their excitement at partnering with UFO, Peace Is Loud Director of Film Impact and Innovation Stephanie Palumbo and Learning & Filmmaker Outreach Lead Florencia Varela add: “We're thrilled to launch our first-ever in-person residency dedicated to both post-production support and impact planning. This innovative model not only allows filmmakers to advance their edit but also ensures they're equipped with tools and support to drive lasting social change. Wood Street filmmakers Caron Creighton and Estevan Padilla have already demonstrated a deep commitment to accountable storytelling, prioritizing the safety and well-being of the film's participants, in addition to demonstrating a compelling artistic vision.”

Documentary previously covered Wood Street's selection for a 2023 Berkeley Film Foundation film grant. Since then, the project has gathered a fair bit of momentum with pitches at Big Sky, Realscreen Summit, an upcoming appearance at Black Public Media's PitchBlack Forum, and a grant from the Fund for Investigative Journalism.
