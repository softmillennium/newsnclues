                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After making high-dollar donations and, in some cases, appearing at President Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration, billionaire tech and finance CEOs are watching their companies' stocks plunge. Here is how much eight companies lost in share value since Trump's inauguration day as of market close on Tuesday, April 8, 2025, according to Yahoo Finance. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, personally donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee and attended the ceremony. In addition to attending Trump's inauguration, Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, also congratulated Trump on his election win and said, "We are in a golden age of American innovation." Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund. Uber and its CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, each donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund. Goldman Sachs donated an unspecified amount to Trump's inauguration fund. Other notable business leaders who have donated in some way to Trump — though not specifically to his inauguration — are Tesla's Elon Musk and Oracle's Larry Ellison. Tesla CEO Elon Musk donated at least $260 million to put Trump back in the White House. Musk and his PAC also spent at least $12 million on the Wisconsin Supreme Court election to support a conservative candidate, who eventually lost. Tesla's diminished share value comes after not only tariff and recession fears but also a widespread protest movement against his company and involvement in the White House DOGE office. One Telsa fan called the carmaker's decline in sales "brutal," and branding experts have said it would take significant concessions from Musk to rebrand Tesla. Musk himself said that running his businesses while working closely with the White House hadn't been easy. Oracle's cofounder and chairman, Larry Ellison, was one of the few top technology executives to openly support Trump back in 2020. Ellison, Sam Altman of OpenAI, and SoftBank's Masayoshi Son are also spearheading Project Stargate, a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative supported by Trump. Meta, Google, Oracle, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, Goldman Sachs, and Uber did not immediately respond to requests for comments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Find the Best Personal Loan for You Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit A federal judge on Tuesday ruled that the White House cannot bar Associated Press reporters and photographers from the Oval Office, Air Force One, and other secure spaces where journalists from other media outlets are admitted. District Court Judge Trevor McFadden in an order said that the White House's current blocking access to AP journalists to those tightly controlled spaces with President Donald Trump is "contrary to the First Amendment" of the U.S. Constitution. McFadden, who was appointed to the bench by Trump, stayed his order requiring the White House to restore access from taking effect until Sunday, to give the White House time to appeal his ruling in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. The AP's stylebook is widely used by media outlets, including CNBC. "It does not bestow special treatment upon the AP. The 179-year-old wire service has long had its reporters and photographers be part of the small and highly select press pool of journalists who attend most White House events in the Oval Office and other small spaces, as well as travel with the president. Julie Pace, the AP's executive editor, in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published March 26, "For anyone who thinks The Associated Press' lawsuit against President Trump's White House is about the name of a body of water, think bigger." "It's really about whether the government can control what you say," Pace wrote. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on McFadden's ruling. AP spokesperson Lauren Easton, in a statement, said, "We are gratified by the court's decision." "Today's ruling affirms the fundamental right of the press and public to speak freely without government retaliation," Easton said. "This is a freedom guaranteed for all Americans in the U.S. "We look forward to continuing to provide factual, nonpartisan and independent coverage of the White House for billions of people around the world," she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is CNBC's live coverage of how the White House, U.S. trade partners and employers are responding to President Donald Trump's historic tariffs. Trump says the U.S. is "doing very well" in early negotiations with other countries who are set to soon face steep tariffs on their imports. "I call them tailored deals, not off the rack," Trump said at an executive order signing event at the White House. At that rate, none of the 86 countries set to face new, so-called reciprocal tariffs will be able to head off the new duties before they take effect at 12:01 a.m. Canada reconfirmed plans to implement 25% retaliatory tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles into Canada, saying the new levies will go into effect at 12:01 a.m. The latter part means that even if a vehicle made by General Motors, Ford Motor or Stellantis in the U.S. is compliant with USMCA, the parts that aren't from Canada and Mexico will be taxed. Canadian officials said "a remission framework for auto producers that incentivizes production and investment in Canada, and helps maintain jobs in the country, will also be implemented." Canada's retaliatory tariffs also do not include auto parts, which Trump expects to implement on non-U.S. components by May 3. Needham analyst Laura Martin cast doubt on Trump's belief that Apple can move its iPhone manufacturing to the U.S. "I don't think that's a thing," Martin said on CNBC's "The Exchange." Martin was responding to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt's suggestion that the company could move its production of the smartphone stateside. One analyst predicted that an iPhone would cost $3,500 if produced in the U.S. Mortgage rates hit their highest level in more than a month amid continued uncertainty over the tariffs. The rates are now close to levels seen over the past six weeks, eliminating last week's declines for would-be homebuyers. About 70 countries have reached out to the White House with "inquiries" about the tariffs, and they're "starting the negotiations right now," House Majority Whip Rep. Tom Emmer tells reporters after a meeting with Bessent. "The president would have liked to hold off longer, but they've had so many responses from not only our allies ... but even our adversaries, about trade that they're starting the negotiations right now," Emmer, R-Minn.,says, according to Punchbowl News. U.S. Customs and Border Protection says it is prepared to begin enforcing Trump's so-called reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries' imports once the new duties kick in after midnight Wednesday. CBP will be collecting "an individualized reciprocal higher tariff from 11% to 50% for 86 countries with exclusions on April 9, 2025, at 12:01 a.m. EDT," the agency said in a statement. CBP also boasted that it has already collected more than $4.8 billion in tariffs on Chinese imports, more than $2 billion on Mexican imports and about $861 million on Canadian imports in response to Trump's prior executive orders. Mortgage rates hit their highest level in more than a month amid continued uncertainty over the tariffs. The rates are now close to levels seen over the past six weeks, eliminating last week's declines for would-be homebuyers. Trump believes that Apple can make iPhones in the United States, the White House said today, as the administration pushes Apple to move device production to U.S. shores in response to Trump's tariffs. "Absolutely, he believes we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it," Leavitt said when asked if Trump envisions U.S. workers doing device production like screwing parts into iPhones. "As you know, Apple has invested $500 billion in the United States, so if Apple didn't think the the United States could do it, it wouldn't have put up that big chunk of change," she said. Apple does the majority of its manufacturing in China — which will receive a 104% tariff on Wednesday — and has secondary production in Vietnam, India, and other countries which are also in line to receive new import duties. Stock indexes gave up much of their early gains, as a market rebound appeared to lose steam in midday trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which roared nearly 4% higher when markets opened, was up about 0.7% at 2 p.m. The volatile session followed a multi-day stock plunge spurred by Trump's announcement of sweeping new tariffs on nearly every country on earth. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt minimized an increasingly hostile public feud between Elon Musk and trade advisor Peter Navarro. "Look, these are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and on tariffs," Leavitt told reporters at a briefing when asked about the spat between the Trump administration colleagues. The U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports will shoot up to 104% at 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday, a White House official confirmed to CNBC. Beijing vowed that it would not scrap its 34% retaliatory tariffs. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis told Greer he is "skeptical" that Trump's tariff strategy will work and not alienate voters. The North Carolina lawmaker pressed Greer at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on who would be held responsible if the strategy fails. The report came as Musk continued a days-old feud with Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro, who is an ardent supporter of the tariffs. What he says here is demonstrably false," Musk wrote on X, his social media site. One of the reporters, Faiz Siddiqui, covers X and Tesla, whose CEO is Musk. The House legislation, dubbed The Trade Review Act of 2025, requires Trump to give Congress 48 hours' notice before imposing or increasing tariffs, along with an explanation and an impact assessment. The legislature also allows Congress to end a tariff early via joint resolution. The bill was introduced by Reps. Don Bacon, R-Neb., Jeff Hurd, R-Colo., Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., and Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y. It mirrors a Senate bill previously introduced by Sens. It's "classic Donald Trump," Wyden said during a hearing with Greer. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer cited the ongoing feud between Navarro and Musk as he argued for the president to "immediately reverse his reckless trade war." "Their plan is so crazy, so controversial, that this administration cannot get its act together, with them calling names about each other, to — against one another, about this tariff plan." "Donald Trump should immediately reverse his reckless trade war," said Schumer. "He should halt his tariff tax at once, and he should start focusing more on America's actual trade adversaries, like China, instead of picking a fight with the entire world and causing chaos and steering us towards a recession in the process." National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said the Trump administration is "managing a massive number of requests for negotiations" from countries seeking to be spared from aggressive new U.S. tariffs. "It is challenging to go through them," Hassett said in a Fox News interview. Jimmy Donaldson, also known as MrBeast on the internet, says the chocolate bars he sells through his company, Feastables, will be cheaper to make under Trump's new tariffs. "Ironically, because of all the new tariffs it is now way cheaper to make our chocolate bars we sell globally NOT in America because other countries don't have a 20%+ tariff on our cogs," Donaldson posted. Donaldson is the most followed creator on YouTube, with more than 380 million subscribers. He founded the chocolate company in 2022 and has built it into a global brand. Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung said his nation is prepared to negotiate with the U.S. on tariffs and other trade issues. "As long as the negotiation time and method are confirmed, we can negotiate with the United States at any time," he said. Subscribers accounted for nearly half of all spending on Walmart's website and app in its most recent fiscal year, the company told CNBC. That gives Walmart a few advantages if Trump's tariffs raise its input costs or trigger an economic downturn. As the memberships are highly profitable, they give Walmart room to keep prices of groceries and other staples low even if the company's expenses increase. Walmart+ is gaining ground at a good time for Walmart. The retailer gave a financial outlook that disappointed Wall Street in February — even before Trump announced the steep duties on key U.S. trade partners. California Rep. Ro Khanna says Trump's tariffs have been hitting his district in Silicon Valley hard, especially with delayed IPOs and mergers. "I'm hearing that these are some of the most self-destructive, wealth-destroying policies that any modern president has had," Khanna said on CNBC's "Squawk Box." Khanna also singled out Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, calling Lutnick's claim that tariffs would lead to more iPhone production false. "I know Lutnick loves 19th-century policies, but he should understand 21st-century production," Khanna said. "Bring in new people on an economic team, assure the country you're never going to do blanket tariffs again, that was a mistake, and that you're going to look at things sector by sector." Businesses and consumers want certainty as Trump's steep tariffs loom, says Levi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass. We need some clarity," she said on CNBC's "Mad Money." Levi's manufactures some of its products in countries like Cambodia and Vietnam, which will face 49% and 46% tariffs, respectively, under Trump's plan. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is sharply escalating his attacks on top Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro as he defends his car company and chafes against the administration's tariff plans. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks," Musk, Trump's top campaign donor, wrote on X, the social media platform he owns. What he says here is demonstrably false," Musk wrote in another post. Musk was responding to Navarro's contention in a CNBC interview on Monday that Musk is not a car manufacturer but a car "assembler" whose vehicles are made of many parts sourced from overseas. Days earlier, Musk in a since-deleted X post said Navarro "ain't built s---." Musk currently works for Trump as head of the White House DOGE initiative. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shrugged off questions about Musk's attacks on his colleague. Cambodia is being hit with the biggest single nation tariff rate of all, at 49%. This has major implications for its factories, now in a fight to survive the next few months if the tariffs are implemented, as retail partners freeze orders. Its one million workers, many of whom are women at the low-end of the global income distribution pie, are facing financial ruin. But a U.S. trade group that represents retailers reliant on Cambodia says factories now based in Cambodia will "absolutely not" be coming back to the U.S. Instead, they will seek out alternative manufacturing locations in lower tariff regimes. Read the full story: Cambodia, hit with Trump's steepest tariffs, 'absolutely not' sending factories back to U.S., says trade group Trump says China "wants to make a deal" as his deadline for steep new tariffs draws near, but adds that Beijing has not yet reached out to the United States. "They don't know how to get it started. Trump also held what he described as a "great call" with South Korea's acting president, Han Duck-soo. "We have the confines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries." U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says China is playing with a "losing hand" in the escalating tariff back-and-forth between the two countries. "I think it was a big mistake, this Chinese escalation, because they're playing with a pair of twos," Bessent said on "Squawk Box." "If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals," he said, "and part of the calculus of that may be that some part of the tariffs stay on." Last night, members of the administration discussed which countries to prioritize for trade talks, he added. Founder and CEO of Citadel Ken Griffin is taking aim at Trump's tariffs, calling them a a "huge policy mistake" that will hurt middle-class Americans. "Since this began, money is leaving the United States to be reinvested in Europe," Boujnah said in an interview with France Inter radio today. Investors, he said, are struggling to navigate Trump's unpredictability, which is making the U.S. "We are mourning the United States that we knew … which was very similar in values and institutions to Europe," he said. "Now it looks more like an emerging country." Euronext operates markets in various European cities, including Paris, Milan, Amsterdam, Brussels and Dublin. Historical allies the U.S. and European Union should have zero tariffs between them, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen urged amid the bloc's ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of 20% White House duties it was slapped with last week. The EU has previously expressed willingness to take steps against Washington if negotiations fail, but it has yet to specify the nature and extent of these potential countermeasures. Trump will sign energy-related Executive Orders this afternoon, and deliver a speech to House Republicans this evening, according to the White House schedule. 3:00 p.m.    Trump participates in an Unleashing American Energy Executive Order signing event White House East Room6:45 p.m.   Trump delivers remarks at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinnerThe National Building Museum U.S. markets are poised to open higher this morning, after three days of steep losses. Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rebounded 747 points, or 2%. Asian markets also closed higher Tuesday, staunching a decline fueled by Trump's tariff rollout that has seen the biggest losses since the pandemic. Von der Leyen and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held "constructive" talks today that touch on a possible mechanism for trade diversion in the wake of sweeping levies announced by the world's first economy. "In response to the widespread disruption caused by the US tariffs, President von der Leyen stressed the responsibility of Europe and China, as two of world's largest markets, to support a strong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field," according to an EU readout, which added that von der Leyen called for a "negotiated resolution to the current situation" that avoids escalation. "The leaders discussed setting up a mechanism for tracking possible trade diversion and ensuring any developments are duly addressed," the readout said. Speculation has been mounting whether Trump's protectionist agenda will push U.S. trade partners toward China in a bid to redress commercial relations. Beijing has already retaliated with its own 34% levies on the U.S., which is now threatening further countermeasures. Greer's testimony will offer the Senate one of its first opportunities to question a Trump administration official about the president's trade and tariff policy since Trump unveiled the sweeping new tariff regime. ET, and CNBC.com will stream the hearing on our liveblog. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez will visit China and Vietnam later this week, as Europe prepares to absorb the impacts of a new 20% tariff rate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Our usual Qantas flight from Dallas to Melbourne is considered one of the longest in the world, and it can be pretty intense. After years of flying it in economy, my wife and I recently accumulated enough Qantas air miles to experience the long-haul flight in business class, which would typically cost thousands of dollars a seat. The dedicated business-class check-in and priority boarding meant our journey got off to a stress-free start. I checked boxes for my morning preferences and loved that I could confidently maximize precious sleep time without missing a meal. My wife and I had the middle pair of seats in our row in business class, where two seats occupied the space of four economy spots. Each pod featured a 16-inch HD screen loaded with hundreds of movies and TV shows, ample storage for essentials, USB charging ports, and enough space to store a small carry-on bag within arm's reach. The multicourse dinner rivaled meals I've had at high-end restaurants. The main course was a seasoned beef fillet served with corn purée, green beans, and red wine jus. As someone who usually avoids sweet desserts, I enjoyed finishing my meal with a curated cheese selection paired with red wine. Flight attendants also regularly walked through the cabin to offer us water and light refreshments, ensuring we stayed well-hydrated during the long journey. As it got later, I changed into my complimentary Qantas pajamas in the bathroom and returned to my pod to find it had been transformed into a comfortable sleeping space. The seat-turned-bed was flat, and I had enough room to fully stretch out. Curling up in a bed was way nicer than contorting into increasingly uncomfortable positions while trying to nap upright in economy. When we landed, I felt refreshed rather than exhausted. Our business-class perks also continued on the ground. We were in an Uber to our next destination within 30 minutes of landing. By upgrading to business class, our 17-hour journey transformed from an exhausting ordeal into a luxurious experience. Despite arriving in Melbourne at 5:30 a.m., I stayed awake all day and didn't experience the foggy head and zombie-like state I always feel after long-haul flights. However, trying to use frequent-flyer and credit-card points to upgrade can be a great value — especially on long-haul routes like this. It'll be challenging to return to the economy cabin for my next trip, but I'm already saving points for our next business-class adventure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's an uneasy time for the many families who rely on the stock market's returns to send their children to college. Stocks have been in the red amid President Donald Trump's new tariff policy and worries of a global trade war. The S&P 500 dropped around 15% between when Trump took office on Jan. 20 and Apr. State-sponsored 529 college savings plans, like other investment accounts, may see the market selloff reflected in their balances. These plans, which are named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, allow parents to invest money and then withdraw it tax-free to cover certain education expenses. Fortunately, you have options if a college bill is due soon, financial experts say. Meanwhile, if your child is still young, it may actually be a good time to buy stocks at a discount. "The stock market will eventually recover," said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. If an investor put $10,000 into the S&P 500 index on Jan. 3, 2005, and left that money untouched until Dec. 31, 2024, they would have amassed $71,750, for a 10.4% annualized return over that time, according to JPMorgan Asset Management's research. Here's what college savers should know during the market volatility. Many 529 plans use an age-based asset allocation — meaning the mix of investments is based on the beneficiary's age and time horizon, and typically becomes more conservative as they approach college enrollment age. "A 5 year-old has a long time horizon, whereas someone entering [college] this fall should not have that much at risk," said Barry Glassman, a certified financial planner and the founder and president of Glassman Wealth Services. Another benefit of the age-based investment strategy is that the funds automatically rebalance to sell high and buy low, added Glassman, who is also a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council. "So not only are they getting less risky over time, but they have been taking profits as stocks have soared to bring risk back into check," he said. More from Personal Finance:Selling out during the market's worst days can hurt you3 strategies to keep your money safe amid market volatilityDon't miss these tax strategies during the tariff sell-off Parents should check to see if their 529 plan account is invested in "a dynamic" portfolio, Kantrowitz said. If you're facing an imminent college bill and see that your 529 account balance has taken a big hit of late, you still have options to avoid drawing down the balance and to give stocks time to potentially recover, experts said. You can use other potential cash savings or income to try to delay a 529 plan distribution until the market comes back, Kantrowitz said. Families can potentially use their 529 college savings account to repay student debt for a beneficiary without incurring taxes or penalties, Kantrowitz explained. Families with many years ahead of them before sending their child to college should see the current moment as investment opportunity, Glassman said. "During market turmoil, they are scooping up bargains to invest for the future," Glassman said. "Pulling out funds now will lock in losses," Kantrowitz said. "If anything, families should save more now that the market is down." Over longer periods, the stock market has historically given more than it takes. Advisors say it's best for investors, once they've set up a smart allocation strategy, to look away from headlines and let the market do its thing. The stock market typically experiences at least three 10% drops and at least one 20% drop in any 17-year period, the typical timeline from birth to college, he added.

They are part of the brand's previously announced plans to offer a full lineup of all-electric cars, crossovers and SUVs, he said. Crossovers blend elements of cars with a traditional truck-based SUV. Cadillac, which has pulled back on its ambitions to exclusively sell EVs by 2030, has been on an aggressive product rollout that has included introducing six new or updated products in the past year or so. That has included EVs and gas-powered vehicles. 3 selling vehicle last year behind the Escalade SUV and Lyriq. Sales of the XT6 have largely been underwhelming since its launch in 2019, with sales averaging about 19,000 units a year. It was the last of GM's three-row crossovers to be released during that time and shared many components with the less expensive GMC Acadia. GM confirmed the downtime, as well as temporary plant layoffs for workers, citing the need to adjust vehicle inventory with demand.

The breach, first disclosed and resolved in February, involved information related to the "financial condition of federally regulated financial institutions used in its examinations and supervisory oversight processes." The regulator said it is using external cybersecurity experts for a full review of the incident and is launching a review of its IT security policies to prevent further attacks. "There will be full accountability for the vulnerabilities identified and any missed internal findings that led to the unauthorized access," he added. Hackers had access to more than 150,000 emails from June 2023 until earlier this year, Bloomberg reported earlier, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit This is CNBC's live coverage of how the White House, U.S. trade partners and employers are responding to President Donald Trump's historic tariffs. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt minimized an increasingly hostile public feud between Elon Musk and trade advisor Peter Navarro. "Look, these are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and on tariffs," Leavitt told reporters at a briefing when asked about the spat between the Trump administration colleagues. The U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports will shoot up to 104% at 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday, a White House official confirmed to CNBC. Beijing vowed that it would not scrap its 34% retaliatory tariffs. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis told U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer he is "skeptical" that Trump's tariff strategy will work and not alienate voters. The North Carolina lawmaker pressed Greer at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on who would be held responsible if the strategy fails. The report came a Musk continued a days-old feuding with Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro, who is an ardent supporter of the tariffs. What he says here is demonstrably false," Musk wrote on X, his social media site. One of the reporters, Faiz Siddiqui, covers X and Tesla, whose CEO is Musk. A quartet of congressmen are introducing a bipartisan bill that would rein in Trump's tariff powers by giving Congress a final say over whether his duties can remain in effect. The House legislation, dubbed The Trade Review Act of 2025, requires Trump to give Congress 48 hours' notice before imposing or increasing tariffs, along with an explanation and an impact assessment. The legislature also allows Congress to end a tariff early via joint resolution. The bill was introduced by Reps. Don Bacon, R-Neb., Jeff Hurd, R-Colo., Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., and Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y. It mirrors a Senate bill previously introduced by Sens. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer cited the ongoing feud between Navarro and Musk as he argued for the president to "immediately reverse his reckless trade war." He called him a moron," Schumer said, "Their plan is so crazy, so controversial, that this administration cannot get its act together with them, calling names about each other, to--against one one another, about this tariff plan." "Donald Trump should immediately reverse his reckless trade war," said Schumer. "He should halt his tariff tax at once, and he should start focusing more on America's actual trade adversaries like China, instead of picking a fight with the entire world and causing chaos and steering us towards a recession in the process." National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett says that the Trump administration is "managing a massive number of requests for negotiations" from countries seeking to be spared from aggressive new U.S. tariffs. "It is challenging to go through them," Hassett said in a Fox News interview. Jimmy Donaldson, also known as MrBeast on the internet, says the chocolate bars he sells through his company, Feastables, will be cheaper to make under Trump's new tariffs. "Ironically, because of all the new tariffs it is now way cheaper to make our chocolate bars we sell globally NOT in America because other countries don't have a 20%+ tariff on our cogs," Donaldson posted. Donaldson is the most followed creator on YouTube, with more than 380 million subscribers. He founded the chocolate company in 2022 and has built it into a global brand. Chocolate from the company is produced in Peru and the United States and is sold in 20 countries. Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung said his nation is prepared to negotiate with the U.S. on tariffs and other trade issues. "Regarding the negotiation content, whether it is reducing tariffs or investment procurement, especially the non-tariff trade barriers that the U.S. is concerned about, we have prepared various plans," Chia-lung told reporters. "As long as the negotiation time and method are confirmed, we can negotiate with the United States at any time," he said. Subscribers accounted for nearly half of all spending on Walmart's website and app in its most recent fiscal year, the company told CNBC. That gives Walmart a few advantages if Trump's tariffs raise its input costs or trigger an economic downturn. As the memberships are highly profitable, they give Walmart room to keep prices of groceries and other staples low even if the company's expenses increase. Walmart+ is gaining ground at a good time for Walmart. The retailer gave a financial outlook that disappointed Wall Street in February — even before Trump announced the steep duties on key U.S. trade partners. "It's based on a fallacy" that "somehow, in a trade, someone must lose," Paul said on CNBC's "Squawk Box." California Rep. Ro Khanna says Trump's tariffs have been hitting his district in Silicon Valley hard, especially with delayed IPOs and mergers. "I'm hearing that these are some of the most self-destructive, wealth-destroying policies that any modern president has had," Khanna said on CNBC's "Squawk Box." Khanna also singled out Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, calling Lutnick's claim that tariffs would lead to more iPhone production false. "I know Lutnick loves 19th-century policies, but he should understand 21st-century production," Khanna said. "Bring in new people on an economic team, assure the country you're never going to do blanket tariffs again, that was a mistake, and that you're going to look at things sector by sector." Businesses and consumers want certainty as Trump's steep tariffs loom, says Levi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass. We need some clarity," she said on CNBC's "Mad Money." Levi's manufactures some of its products in countries like Cambodia and Vietnam, which will face 49% and 46% tariffs, respectively, under Trump's plan. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is sharply escalating his attacks on top Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro as he defends his car company and chafes against the administration's tariff plans. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks," Musk, Trump's top campaign donor, wrote on X, the social media platform he owns. What he says here is demonstrably false," Musk wrote in another post. Musk was responding to Navarro's contention in a CNBC interview on Monday that Musk is not a car manufacturer but a car "assembler" whose vehicles are made of many parts sourced from overseas. Days earlier, Musk in a since-deleted X post said Navarro "ain't built s---." Musk currently works for Trump as head of the White House DOGE initiative. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shrugged off questions about Musk's attacks on his colleague. Cambodia is being hit with the biggest single nation tariff rate of all, at 49%. This has major implications for its factories, now in a fight to survive the next few months if the tariffs are implemented, as retail partners freeze orders. Its one million workers, many of whom are women at the low-end of the global income distribution pie, are facing financial ruin. But a U.S. trade group that represents retailers reliant on Cambodia says factories now based in Cambodia will "absolutely not" be coming back to the U.S. Instead, they will seek out alternative manufacturing locations in lower tariff regimes. Read the full story: Cambodia, hit with Trump's steepest tariffs, 'absolutely not' sending factories back to U.S., says trade group Trump says China "wants to make a deal" as his deadline for steep new tariffs draws near, but adds that Beijing has not yet reached out to the United States. "They don't know how to get it started. Trump also held what he described as a "great call" with South Korea's acting president, Han Duck-soo. "We have the confines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries." U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says China is playing with a "losing hand" in the escalating tariff back-and-forth between the two countries. "I think it was a big mistake, this Chinese escalation, because they're playing with a pair of twos," Bessent said on "Squawk Box." "If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals," he said, "and part of the calculus of that may be that some part of the tariffs stay on." Last night, members of the administration discussed which countries to prioritize for trade talks, he added. Founder and CEO of Citadel Ken Griffin is taking aim at Trump's tariffs, calling them a a "huge policy mistake" that will hurt middle-class Americans. "Since this began, money is leaving the United States to be reinvested in Europe," Boujnah said in an interview with France Inter radio today. Investors, he said, are struggling to navigate Trump's unpredictability, which is making the U.S. "We are mourning the United States that we knew … which was very similar in values and institutions to Europe," he said. "Now it looks more like an emerging country." Euronext operates markets in various European cities, including Paris, Milan, Amsterdam, Brussels and Dublin. Historical allies the U.S. and European Union should have zero tariffs between them, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen urged amid the bloc's ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of 20% White House duties it was slapped with last week. The EU has previously expressed willingness to take steps against Washington if negotiations fail, but it has yet to specify the nature and extent of these potential countermeasures. Trump will sign energy-related Executive Orders this afternoon, and deliver a speech to House Republicans this evening, according to the White House schedule. 3:00 p.m.    Trump participates in an Unleashing American Energy Executive Order signing event White House East Room6:45 p.m.   Trump delivers remarks at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinnerThe National Building Museum U.S. markets are poised to open higher this morning, after three days of steep losses. Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rebounded 747 points, or 2%. Asian markets also closed higher Tuesday, staunching a decline fueled by Trump's tariff rollout that has seen the biggest losses since the pandemic. Von der Leyen and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held "constructive" talks today that touch on a possible mechanism for trade diversion in the wake of sweeping levies announced by the world's first economy. "In response to the widespread disruption caused by the US tariffs, President von der Leyen stressed the responsibility of Europe and China, as two of world's largest markets, to support a strong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field," according to an EU readout, which added that von der Leyen called for a "negotiated resolution to the current situation" that avoids escalation. "The leaders discussed setting up a mechanism for tracking possible trade diversion and ensuring any developments are duly addressed," the readout said. Speculation has been mounting whether Trump's protectionist agenda will push U.S. trade partners toward China in a bid to redress commercial relations. Beijing has already retaliated with its own 34% levies on the U.S., which is now threatening further countermeasures. Greer's testimony will offer the Senate one of its first opportunities to question a Trump administration official about the president's trade and tariff policy since Trump unveiled the sweeping new tariff regime. ET, and CNBC.com will stream the hearing on our liveblog. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez will visit China and Vietnam later this week, as Europe prepares to absorb the impacts of a new 20% tariff rate. Sanchez is scheduled to visit Hanoi on Wednesday, the same day the new Trump tariff rates go into effect. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nathaneo Johnson and Sean Hargrow, both students at Yale University, think so. The two college juniors founded Series, an AI social network that matches people over text messages, in 2024 as a new way for Gen Z students to find professional connections. The founders said one of the biggest problems they saw in professional networking was that social media platforms — like LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter), or Instagram — had become bloated with vanity metrics like follower counts and likes. "Forget your likes, forget your followers, let's focus on who you are and what you can bring to the table and what you need, and what somebody else can bring to your table if it makes sense." Series lets users chat with an "AI Friend" over iMessage or SMS about the type of connection they are looking for, such as a cofounder, investor, or mentor. For instance, I got assigned an AI Friend "Stevie," who told me over text that it would "start scouting for the best connections" and hit up one of its other AI Friends, "Oliver." The startup fits into a broader trend of AI disrupting consumer technology, which has revitalized investor interest in companies applying AI to areas like social networks and even dating. "There's this new area opening up because of the technology," Johnson said. Since launching its first chatbot in the summer of 2024, Series has expanded to over 500 universities. While you can set up an account without a student email (like I did), using a college student email lets users access features like group chats. As Series grows, the founders said in its pitch deck shared with investors that it plans to expand beyond student entrepreneurs and professional networking. The startup is also building out early monetization with premium features for enterprise users, which will include different paid tiers that unlock additional AI agents and more customization. Series' $3.1 million pre-seed round was led by Anne Lee Skates, a former partner at Andreessen Horowitz. Read the 11-page pitch deck Series used to raise its $3.1 million pre-seed: The slide also includes a visual representation of how follower counts impact someone's feelings around reaching out. It includes examples of questions people may ask others in their network, such as: We've opened up Series to college students for early access — prioritizing those with the most vetted networks For business owners looking to meet a specific type of person more frequently - meeting their advertising, sourcing, and lead-gen needs We plan on expanding beyond entrepreneurs — so anyone to access the right people.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The list includes a blanket "10% tariffs on all countries," according to a White House memo, and higher rates on certain competitors, such as China, India and the European Union. That's on top of existing tariffs the administration had previously announced. Tariffs are paid by importing companies, which can increase costs for businesses. Job cuts are one way American business leaders may attempt to control their costs. As of early afternoon Monday, the S&P 500 had fallen around 19% from its record high in February. The labor market could see similar volatility, experts say. More than a third, 37%, of CEOs said they expect to cut jobs this year, according to a CNBC survey of its CEO Council, which includes more than 100 CEOs in various industries. Some companies have already started layoffs: Car manufacturer Stellantis announced April 3 it was temporarily laying off 900 employees as a result of the president's tariffs. Agriculture jobs may be similarly affected, says Harry Holzer, senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and professor of public policy at Georgetown University. Companies whose products are entirely made in the U.S. could benefit: "At least in the short term, employment would likely rise there, because those folks will see more demand," says Holzer. That could mean cumulative hikes of tens of thousands or even a few hundred thousand jobs added in the next three or four months, he says. The Budget Lab at Yale calculated that Trump's tariffs will cut 2025 U.S. GDP growth by a percentage point. That represents "roughly half a million people," he says. The rise in unemployment could be even higher, according to Holzer's loose calculations: Job losses "could be in the millions," he says. In the long run, Tedeschi predicts another "200,000 to 300,000" fewer people in the labor market every year as a result of Trump's tariffs. "That's going to have big direct employment effects" as well, says Hersh. Uncertainty about future policy changes could cause businesses to cut both roles in the near term and create fewer jobs down the line. "It's the chaotic way in which they've been rolled out." That's because, "when you don't know what the tariff rate is going to be an hour from now, let alone a week from now or a month from now or a year from now, how can you as a business hire and invest in that environment?" The White House has not responded to a request for comment. Experts recommend staying calm and beefing up your emergency fund with six months or more of savings to cover a possible job loss.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit Last week the 30-year fixed rate dropped to the lowest level since last October after President Donald Trump announced global tariffs. "Last week's drop was a knee-jerk reaction that priced in more dire economic expectations," said Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. "So far this week, bonds are less panicked after several officials have discussed tariff negotiations and deals. Just this morning, when [Treasury Secretary Scott] Bessent referred to tariffs as a melting ice cube, we saw an immediate reaction in the market. Bottom line, rates took a lead off last week as economic fears surged. Now they're back on base and waiting for the next pitch," he said. The initial drop in mortgage rates last week had housing watchers cheering a potential boost to the lackluster spring market. Mortgage rates had been moving in a very narrow range since the end of February, lower than last year, but not by much. Homebuyers are also contending with high, and still rising, home prices, as well as dwindling confidence in the broader economy and their own employment. "The spring housing season is beginning with more sellers and a growing number of homes for sale," said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in its March housing report. "But the high cost of buying coupled with growing economic concerns suggest a sluggish response from buyers in early spring." The biggest drop in rates so far this year came not last week, but in January and February, when the 30-year fixed mortgage fell from a high of 7.26% to 6.74%. Despite that decline, pending home sales, which are a measure of initial signed contracts on existing homes, and therefore the most recent indicator of activity, rose just 2% in February from January, according to the National Association of Realtors. "Despite the modest monthly increase, contract signings remain well below normal historical levels," said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. "A meaningful decline in mortgage rates would help both demand and supply – demand by boosting affordability, and supply by lessening the power of the mortgage rate lock-in effect." The next significant move in mortgage rates could come as the market digests new economic data, namely Thursday's consumer price index and Friday's produce price index reports. Both have a strong track record of influencing rate momentum. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk escalated his own sort of trade war Tuesday morning — not against another country, but against President Donald Trump's top trade advisor, Peter Navarro. He followed up by saying: "Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks." Less than 20 minutes later, Musk shot out yet another insult, correcting another user's spelling of Navarro's name with a play on the R-word: "*Peter Retarrdo." Tuesday's posts are the latest in a string of anti-tariff comments from Musk, who said over the weekend that America should establish a "zero-tariff" system with Europe. Musk, who has been heading up Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. "These are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and tariffs," she said. During a Sunday interview on Fox News, he said that Musk is great "when he's in his DOGE lane" but is protecting his own business interests when it comes to criticizing the wide-ranging tariffs Trump announced last week. During the same interview, Navarro said that things are "fine" between the two men and "there's no rift there." Yet Navarro turned up the heat on Monday when he appeared on CNBC, possibly prompting Musk's recent comments. He's a car assembler in many cases," Navarro said, saying that Tesla gets car parts from foreign nations. The markets continue to be roiled by the tariff chaos, with US stocks surging Tuesday morning after a painful three-day sell-off.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stocks extended their losses on Monday, with all three benchmark indexes diving into the red and the S&P 500 briefly entering a bear market as Trump doubled down on his resolve to lower the trade deficit. Here's what Wall Street's top minds have been saying this week. The US is likely already mired in a downturn — and stocks could plummet another 20% before they find a bottom, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said. Still, he said the sell-off in stocks looked like "more of a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity," adding that he didn't believe tariffs were creating systemic risks to the economy. Economic chaos is likely if Trump doesn't pause or scale back tariffs immediately, the billionaire hedge funder Bill Ackman said Monday in a post on X. In a separate post, Ackman said his firm wouldn't dump its US stock holdings even if tariff fears sparked a massive price drop. "We will suffer mark-to-market losses if the market crashes, but we will not be sellers in a declining market," Ackman said, adding: "Over the long term, we are exposed to the health of our country and its economy. This is my only investment 'conflict' if you want to call it that." That's because Trump's trade war could rattle the bond market and spark a wave of bankruptcies, he told Bloomberg TV. I believe you cannot put the genie back in the bottle," Weinstein told the outlet in an interview published on Monday, pointing to reciprocal tariffs from China and other knock-on effects from Trump's tariff plan. "There might be something in between that stops the boulder, but I'm very concerned about a crash," he said. In his annual letter to shareholders on Monday, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of the impact of tariffs, saying the steep duties on US imports could slow growth and raise inflation. "The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession," the billionaire banker wrote. Dimon also mentioned stagflation, a scenario where economic growth stagnates while inflation stays high. Stanley Druckenmiller reiterated his stance against tariffs in an X post on Monday. "I do not support tariffs exceeding 10% which I made abundantly clear in the interview you cite," the top investor wrote in response to another post, which featured a clip of a previous CNBC interview. In the interview, Druckenmiller said he saw tariffs within "the 10% range" as the "lesser of two evils," adding that he believed that duties on US imports were "simply a consumption tax" partly paid for by foreign countries. Trump's tariffs are having "very big impacts on markets and economies," but there should be more focus on what caused them and the even greater disruptions ahead, Ray Dalio said in a LinkedIn post on Monday. "The far bigger, far more important thing to keep in mind is that we are seeing a classic breakdown of the major monetary, political, and geopolitical orders," he wrote, adding this kind of event only happened about once in a lifetime. He also pointed to increasingly disruptive acts of nature and technological innovations such as AI as key drivers of the ongoing changes. Trump went too far with his tariffs, leaving investors shellshocked and the economy in danger, Brad Gerstner, the founder and CEO of Altimeter Capital, told Fox Business on Monday. "These are not reciprocal tariffs — this is a nuclear-style assault on global business and it's gonna land us in a recession." The veteran tech investor said Trump needs to show Wall Street he wants fair tariffs and isn't "trying to unwind the entire global system of trade which has worked really well for America." The US can't "just push a button and magically this all resets."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DOGE is taking an ax to consulting, and the contracts being targeted show a major realignment in how the federal government wants to work with consultants under President Donald Trump. Business Insider analyzed the data available on the White House DOGE office's website to work out two things: what services DOGE deems a waste of money and, more broadly, what the government has been paying consultants to do. In the weeks following Trump's inauguration, contracts providing services related to DEIA and renewable energy were the first to be canceled. Another trend in the data is cuts to blanket purchase agreements — an acquisition method that enables the government to easily purchase recurring products. 10 of the federal government's highest-paid consultancies are under particular scrutiny in the consulting crackdown, and so BI's analysis focused on their contracts. The list includes Deloitte, Accenture, and Booz Allen Hamilton. The biggest estimated savings made from a single contract with one of the 10 consultancies so far comes from a General Dynamics IT contract. DOGE claims to have saved $69.1 million from modifying a contract providing a "portfolio of integrated value-oriented technologies" to the Department of Education. General Dynamics was "responsible for the technical management and integration of pivot IT infrastructure services," per a description on the federal procurement data system. $308,469 of services have been cut from a Booz Allen Hamilton contract with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Booz Allen Hamilton makes most of its $10 billion in annual revenue from the US government. DOGE estimates that $400,000 has been saved from a $1.2 million contract to provide "Diversity Equity Inclusion and Accessibility website and strategic planning" services to the Department of Commerce. This contract was altered on 31 January 2025, soon after Trump signed executive orders targeting DEI initiatives for federal employees. Similar examples include a contract for Booz Allen Hamilton to implement DEIA analytics on one of NASA's data platforms and a contract for Deloitte to provide DEIA training for the Department of Health and Human Services. Deloitte was contracted to provide "a temporary staff augmentation solution to support budget operations" at the Export-Import Bank of the US. One of the federal government's common uses of contractors is to outsource to them for employees with technical expertise. Deloitte contractors were directly involved in contributing to accurate financial reporting and ensuring transparency and compliance in budget matters. According to BI's analysis, of the 10 firms, Deloitte has had the highest number of contracts cut or modified so far. Mische, who has been advising some of the affected firms in DC, told BI that these trends signal a shift toward a more commercial, value-driven approach employing consultants. Mische said the government has been operating with a "patchwork" of systems, processes, and open-ended contracts. The Trump administration wants to overhaul how those services are delivered and prepare for more advanced technologies, eliminating the need for so many individual service contracts, he said. Rather than "massive contracts for 300 or 400 million dollars and more, that take years and years to do," Mische predicts that there will be much more emphasis on outcomes. The government's attitude will be, "Show me what you did and show me what I got," he said, adding that fee-for-performance arrangements and measurable metrics for consulting services will likely be introduced. "What I think we're going to see under this administration is a much greater emphasis on design for business outcomes. Not automate the toll path that you're on, but create a new freeway," he said. The five consultancies did not respond to BI's requests for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She was eight during the Great Recession in 2008 and remembers coming home from school, turning on the TV, and seeing advertisements focused on budgeting. Now 24 and working at a nonprofit in San Diego, she's nervous that she's about to relive the not-so-glory days of her youth after years of slowly mounting economic anxiety. With President Donald Trump's trade war in full swing, many see the probability of a downturn rising. Business Insider spoke to two boomers, a millennial, and two Gen Zers about what they're making of a possible economic slump. Martinson, a Gen Zer, said she's always been frugal and isn't too nervous about losing her job, but she feels increased pressure to save money. Michelle Husberg, 62, credits some of her previous recession luck to the saving habits she developed as a young person. A retired nurse, she and her husband never lost jobs or a house or impulsively withdrew all their money from the stock market. They kind of instilled that in me," Husberg said. She's saved money since landing her first job at age 20 and called her dad, a firm believer in the stock market, as a young adult to figure out how much to contribute to her 401(k). Between her husband's pension and Social Security, the two of them don't have to withdraw funds to cover their basic expenses. Most of their money has been invested in the stock market for decades; Husberg remembers watching her savings vanish seemingly overnight in 2001 and 2008. "It is hard when you see the money go, especially when it drops in half," Husberg said of her investments. Gene Cain, a retired 71-year-old, wasn't so fortunate. Now, Cain relies on his Social Security check and lives month-to-month. I know it was a dumb thing to do, but it was what we had to do at the time." Casandra King, a 37-year-old HR manager, said the shadow of 2008 has "impacted me greatly." King, a millennial, graduated from college in 2010 and wasn't able to start saving then. She'd been worried about paying her bills since she was a junior during the Great Recession when she got a job working at Godiva Chocolates to stay afloat and crashed on friends' couches after losing her housing. Ava Hannah, a Gen Zer pursuing a nursing degree at the University of Central Arkansas, barely remembers previous recessions — she was three in 2008 and more focused on "TV and snacks" than market slides — but knows enough to be a little freaked. Hannah and her friends have talked about the possibility of a recession a bit, mainly over meals in the cafeteria. "Usually it's full of jokes, because I don't know what's going to happen, but there's a real underlying element not of despair, but worry at least," she said. "I think a bunch of other kids on campus are also talking about it, because we're all college kids, we don't have money. Husberg is mainly worried about how a recession could impact others, especially people in their 20s, and isn't changing her own habits much to prepare. After landing a new job recently, Martinson became a little looser with her spending but has since abandoned that mindset. She's started listening to news podcasts first thing each morning again, a habit she developed during the pandemic but later dropped. "I'm nervous, and my body and brain are aware of this routine that another historical event is happening," she said. King, the HR manager, is reexamining her family's spending — she and her husband have two kids — to cut out any waste, knowing that things might "seem really crappy for a long time."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In her email, Noem said the buyout offer generally wasn't being extended to law enforcement officials, which includes ICE agents. "As a general rule, Law Enforcement Officials will be exempt from participation in these programs due to their essential mission-critical responsibilities," she wrote. According to Noem's email, the lump sum policy would be considered severance pay. It's not clear whether the offer would follow the Office of Personnel Management's severance pay formula for federal employees. Representatives for DHS did not answer questions about how the offer would work and how many employees received it. "The American people deserve a government that works for them, something President Trump has promised." DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. "Every dollar spent and position filled at DHS should be focused on our core mission of securing our homeland and keeping the American people safe." Employees have until April 14 to decide whether they want to take the offer, which was meant to "reflect our commitment to aligning our workforce with evolving mission needs," Noem wrote in the email, which had the subject line "Reshaping of the DHS workforce." I am writing to share important news regarding new voluntary workforce transition programs approved for immediate implementation across the Department. Components will provide guidance for which of these three programs are available to their respective workforce, to include populations who are excluded from our mission critical frontline workforce. As a general rule, Law Enforcement Officials will be exempt from participation in these programs due to their essential mission-critical responsibilities. This program offers eligible employees a structured and supported path to transition from DHS. Those who choose to participate will receive a brief period of paid administrative leave to complete key tasks, submit retirement documentation, and prepare for departure. Most transitions under this program are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2025, though exact dates may vary depending on individual circumstances. S§ 8336(d)(2) (CSRS) and 8414(b)(1)(B) (FERS), VERA allows eligible employees who meet certain age and service requirements to retire early. This option helps employees who are ready to retire while ensuring DHS can address evolving needs across our Components. Often referred to as a "buyout," this option offers a lump-sum payment of up to $25,000 (or an amount equal to severance pay if lower) for employees in roles slated for voluntary departures. By offering these options, we intend to provide flexibility for employees who may be considering a change, retirement, or new career opportunities, while also supporting the Department's operational readiness. If you believe any or all of these programs might be right for you, please watch for further announcements from your Component leadership or Human Resources office, where you will find more specific eligibility criteria, detailed instructions, and timelines. Your decision to apply for any of these programs will be due NLT 11:59 ET on April 14, 2025. If you have any questions in the meantime, please reach out to your HR office or supervisor for additional guidance.</p>
