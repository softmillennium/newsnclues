                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is CNBC's live coverage of how the White House, U.S. trade partners and employers are responding to President Donald Trump's historic tariffs. Trump says the U.S. is "doing very well" in early negotiations with other countries who are set to soon face steep tariffs on their imports. "I call them tailored deals, not off the rack," Trump said at an executive order signing event at the White House. At that rate, none of the 86 countries set to face new, so-called reciprocal tariffs will be able to head off the new duties before they take effect at 12:01 a.m. Canada reconfirmed plans to implement 25% retaliatory tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles into Canada, saying the new levies will go into effect at 12:01 a.m. The latter part means that even if a vehicle made by General Motors, Ford Motor or Stellantis in the U.S. is compliant with USMCA, the parts that aren't from Canada and Mexico will be taxed. Canadian officials said "a remission framework for auto producers that incentivizes production and investment in Canada, and helps maintain jobs in the country, will also be implemented." Canada's retaliatory tariffs also do not include auto parts, which Trump expects to implement on non-U.S. components by May 3. Needham analyst Laura Martin cast doubt on Trump's belief that Apple can move its iPhone manufacturing to the U.S. "I don't think that's a thing," Martin said on CNBC's "The Exchange." Martin was responding to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt's suggestion that the company could move its production of the smartphone stateside. One analyst predicted that an iPhone would cost $3,500 if produced in the U.S. Mortgage rates hit their highest level in more than a month amid continued uncertainty over the tariffs. The rates are now close to levels seen over the past six weeks, eliminating last week's declines for would-be homebuyers. About 70 countries have reached out to the White House with "inquiries" about the tariffs, and they're "starting the negotiations right now," House Majority Whip Rep. Tom Emmer tells reporters after a meeting with Bessent. "The president would have liked to hold off longer, but they've had so many responses from not only our allies ... but even our adversaries, about trade that they're starting the negotiations right now," Emmer, R-Minn.,says, according to Punchbowl News. U.S. Customs and Border Protection says it is prepared to begin enforcing Trump's so-called reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries' imports once the new duties kick in after midnight Wednesday. CBP will be collecting "an individualized reciprocal higher tariff from 11% to 50% for 86 countries with exclusions on April 9, 2025, at 12:01 a.m. EDT," the agency said in a statement. CBP also boasted that it has already collected more than $4.8 billion in tariffs on Chinese imports, more than $2 billion on Mexican imports and about $861 million on Canadian imports in response to Trump's prior executive orders. Mortgage rates hit their highest level in more than a month amid continued uncertainty over the tariffs. The rates are now close to levels seen over the past six weeks, eliminating last week's declines for would-be homebuyers. Trump believes that Apple can make iPhones in the United States, the White House said today, as the administration pushes Apple to move device production to U.S. shores in response to Trump's tariffs. "Absolutely, he believes we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it," Leavitt said when asked if Trump envisions U.S. workers doing device production like screwing parts into iPhones. "As you know, Apple has invested $500 billion in the United States, so if Apple didn't think the the United States could do it, it wouldn't have put up that big chunk of change," she said. Apple does the majority of its manufacturing in China — which will receive a 104% tariff on Wednesday — and has secondary production in Vietnam, India, and other countries which are also in line to receive new import duties. Stock indexes gave up much of their early gains, as a market rebound appeared to lose steam in midday trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which roared nearly 4% higher when markets opened, was up about 0.7% at 2 p.m. The volatile session followed a multi-day stock plunge spurred by Trump's announcement of sweeping new tariffs on nearly every country on earth. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt minimized an increasingly hostile public feud between Elon Musk and trade advisor Peter Navarro. "Look, these are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and on tariffs," Leavitt told reporters at a briefing when asked about the spat between the Trump administration colleagues. The U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports will shoot up to 104% at 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday, a White House official confirmed to CNBC. Beijing vowed that it would not scrap its 34% retaliatory tariffs. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis told Greer he is "skeptical" that Trump's tariff strategy will work and not alienate voters. The North Carolina lawmaker pressed Greer at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on who would be held responsible if the strategy fails. The report came as Musk continued a days-old feud with Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro, who is an ardent supporter of the tariffs. What he says here is demonstrably false," Musk wrote on X, his social media site. One of the reporters, Faiz Siddiqui, covers X and Tesla, whose CEO is Musk. The House legislation, dubbed The Trade Review Act of 2025, requires Trump to give Congress 48 hours' notice before imposing or increasing tariffs, along with an explanation and an impact assessment. The legislature also allows Congress to end a tariff early via joint resolution. The bill was introduced by Reps. Don Bacon, R-Neb., Jeff Hurd, R-Colo., Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., and Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y. It mirrors a Senate bill previously introduced by Sens. It's "classic Donald Trump," Wyden said during a hearing with Greer. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer cited the ongoing feud between Navarro and Musk as he argued for the president to "immediately reverse his reckless trade war." "Their plan is so crazy, so controversial, that this administration cannot get its act together, with them calling names about each other, to — against one another, about this tariff plan." "Donald Trump should immediately reverse his reckless trade war," said Schumer. "He should halt his tariff tax at once, and he should start focusing more on America's actual trade adversaries, like China, instead of picking a fight with the entire world and causing chaos and steering us towards a recession in the process." National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said the Trump administration is "managing a massive number of requests for negotiations" from countries seeking to be spared from aggressive new U.S. tariffs. "It is challenging to go through them," Hassett said in a Fox News interview. Jimmy Donaldson, also known as MrBeast on the internet, says the chocolate bars he sells through his company, Feastables, will be cheaper to make under Trump's new tariffs. "Ironically, because of all the new tariffs it is now way cheaper to make our chocolate bars we sell globally NOT in America because other countries don't have a 20%+ tariff on our cogs," Donaldson posted. Donaldson is the most followed creator on YouTube, with more than 380 million subscribers. He founded the chocolate company in 2022 and has built it into a global brand. Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung said his nation is prepared to negotiate with the U.S. on tariffs and other trade issues. "As long as the negotiation time and method are confirmed, we can negotiate with the United States at any time," he said. Subscribers accounted for nearly half of all spending on Walmart's website and app in its most recent fiscal year, the company told CNBC. That gives Walmart a few advantages if Trump's tariffs raise its input costs or trigger an economic downturn. As the memberships are highly profitable, they give Walmart room to keep prices of groceries and other staples low even if the company's expenses increase. Walmart+ is gaining ground at a good time for Walmart. The retailer gave a financial outlook that disappointed Wall Street in February — even before Trump announced the steep duties on key U.S. trade partners. California Rep. Ro Khanna says Trump's tariffs have been hitting his district in Silicon Valley hard, especially with delayed IPOs and mergers. "I'm hearing that these are some of the most self-destructive, wealth-destroying policies that any modern president has had," Khanna said on CNBC's "Squawk Box." Khanna also singled out Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, calling Lutnick's claim that tariffs would lead to more iPhone production false. "I know Lutnick loves 19th-century policies, but he should understand 21st-century production," Khanna said. "Bring in new people on an economic team, assure the country you're never going to do blanket tariffs again, that was a mistake, and that you're going to look at things sector by sector." Businesses and consumers want certainty as Trump's steep tariffs loom, says Levi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass. We need some clarity," she said on CNBC's "Mad Money." Levi's manufactures some of its products in countries like Cambodia and Vietnam, which will face 49% and 46% tariffs, respectively, under Trump's plan. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is sharply escalating his attacks on top Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro as he defends his car company and chafes against the administration's tariff plans. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks," Musk, Trump's top campaign donor, wrote on X, the social media platform he owns. What he says here is demonstrably false," Musk wrote in another post. Musk was responding to Navarro's contention in a CNBC interview on Monday that Musk is not a car manufacturer but a car "assembler" whose vehicles are made of many parts sourced from overseas. Days earlier, Musk in a since-deleted X post said Navarro "ain't built s---." Musk currently works for Trump as head of the White House DOGE initiative. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shrugged off questions about Musk's attacks on his colleague. Cambodia is being hit with the biggest single nation tariff rate of all, at 49%. This has major implications for its factories, now in a fight to survive the next few months if the tariffs are implemented, as retail partners freeze orders. Its one million workers, many of whom are women at the low-end of the global income distribution pie, are facing financial ruin. But a U.S. trade group that represents retailers reliant on Cambodia says factories now based in Cambodia will "absolutely not" be coming back to the U.S. Instead, they will seek out alternative manufacturing locations in lower tariff regimes. Read the full story: Cambodia, hit with Trump's steepest tariffs, 'absolutely not' sending factories back to U.S., says trade group Trump says China "wants to make a deal" as his deadline for steep new tariffs draws near, but adds that Beijing has not yet reached out to the United States. "They don't know how to get it started. Trump also held what he described as a "great call" with South Korea's acting president, Han Duck-soo. "We have the confines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries." U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says China is playing with a "losing hand" in the escalating tariff back-and-forth between the two countries. "I think it was a big mistake, this Chinese escalation, because they're playing with a pair of twos," Bessent said on "Squawk Box." "If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals," he said, "and part of the calculus of that may be that some part of the tariffs stay on." Last night, members of the administration discussed which countries to prioritize for trade talks, he added. Founder and CEO of Citadel Ken Griffin is taking aim at Trump's tariffs, calling them a a "huge policy mistake" that will hurt middle-class Americans. "Since this began, money is leaving the United States to be reinvested in Europe," Boujnah said in an interview with France Inter radio today. Investors, he said, are struggling to navigate Trump's unpredictability, which is making the U.S. "We are mourning the United States that we knew … which was very similar in values and institutions to Europe," he said. "Now it looks more like an emerging country." Euronext operates markets in various European cities, including Paris, Milan, Amsterdam, Brussels and Dublin. Historical allies the U.S. and European Union should have zero tariffs between them, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen urged amid the bloc's ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of 20% White House duties it was slapped with last week. The EU has previously expressed willingness to take steps against Washington if negotiations fail, but it has yet to specify the nature and extent of these potential countermeasures. Trump will sign energy-related Executive Orders this afternoon, and deliver a speech to House Republicans this evening, according to the White House schedule. 3:00 p.m.    Trump participates in an Unleashing American Energy Executive Order signing event White House East Room6:45 p.m.   Trump delivers remarks at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinnerThe National Building Museum U.S. markets are poised to open higher this morning, after three days of steep losses. Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rebounded 747 points, or 2%. Asian markets also closed higher Tuesday, staunching a decline fueled by Trump's tariff rollout that has seen the biggest losses since the pandemic. Von der Leyen and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held "constructive" talks today that touch on a possible mechanism for trade diversion in the wake of sweeping levies announced by the world's first economy. "In response to the widespread disruption caused by the US tariffs, President von der Leyen stressed the responsibility of Europe and China, as two of world's largest markets, to support a strong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field," according to an EU readout, which added that von der Leyen called for a "negotiated resolution to the current situation" that avoids escalation. "The leaders discussed setting up a mechanism for tracking possible trade diversion and ensuring any developments are duly addressed," the readout said. Speculation has been mounting whether Trump's protectionist agenda will push U.S. trade partners toward China in a bid to redress commercial relations. Beijing has already retaliated with its own 34% levies on the U.S., which is now threatening further countermeasures. Greer's testimony will offer the Senate one of its first opportunities to question a Trump administration official about the president's trade and tariff policy since Trump unveiled the sweeping new tariff regime. ET, and CNBC.com will stream the hearing on our liveblog. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez will visit China and Vietnam later this week, as Europe prepares to absorb the impacts of a new 20% tariff rate.

A quartet of congressmen are introducing a bipartisan bill that would rein in Trump's tariff powers by giving Congress a final say over whether his duties can remain in effect.

Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung said his nation is prepared to negotiate with the U.S. on tariffs and other trade issues. "Regarding the negotiation content, whether it is reducing tariffs or investment procurement, especially the non-tariff trade barriers that the U.S. is concerned about, we have prepared various plans," Chia-lung told reporters. "As long as the negotiation time and method are confirmed, we can negotiate with the United States at any time," he said.

The retailer gave a financial outlook that disappointed Wall Street in February — even before Trump announced the steep duties on key U.S. trade partners. "It's based on a fallacy" that "somehow, in a trade, someone must lose," Paul said on CNBC's "Squawk Box." California Rep. Ro Khanna says Trump's tariffs have been hitting his district in Silicon Valley hard, especially with delayed IPOs and mergers. "I'm hearing that these are some of the most self-destructive, wealth-destroying policies that any modern president has had," Khanna said on CNBC's "Squawk Box."

Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks," Musk, Trump's top campaign donor, wrote on X, the social media platform he owns. What he says here is demonstrably false," Musk wrote in another post. Musk was responding to Navarro's contention in a CNBC interview on Monday that Musk is not a car manufacturer but a car "assembler" whose vehicles are made of many parts sourced from overseas. Days earlier, Musk in a since-deleted X post said Navarro "ain't built s---." Musk currently works for Trump as head of the White House DOGE initiative. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shrugged off questions about Musk's attacks on his colleague. Cambodia is being hit with the biggest single nation tariff rate of all, at 49%. This has major implications for its factories, now in a fight to survive the next few months if the tariffs are implemented, as retail partners freeze orders. Its one million workers, many of whom are women at the low-end of the global income distribution pie, are facing financial ruin. But a U.S. trade group that represents retailers reliant on Cambodia says factories now based in Cambodia will "absolutely not" be coming back to the U.S. Instead, they will seek out alternative manufacturing locations in lower tariff regimes. Read the full story: Cambodia, hit with Trump's steepest tariffs, 'absolutely not' sending factories back to U.S., says trade group Trump says China "wants to make a deal" as his deadline for steep new tariffs draws near, but adds that Beijing has not yet reached out to the United States. "They don't know how to get it started. Trump also held what he described as a "great call" with South Korea's acting president, Han Duck-soo. "We have the confines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries." U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says China is playing with a "losing hand" in the escalating tariff back-and-forth between the two countries. "I think it was a big mistake, this Chinese escalation, because they're playing with a pair of twos," Bessent said on "Squawk Box." "If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals," he said, "and part of the calculus of that may be that some part of the tariffs stay on." Last night, members of the administration discussed which countries to prioritize for trade talks, he added. Founder and CEO of Citadel Ken Griffin is taking aim at Trump's tariffs, calling them a a "huge policy mistake" that will hurt middle-class Americans. "Since this began, money is leaving the United States to be reinvested in Europe," Boujnah said in an interview with France Inter radio today. Investors, he said, are struggling to navigate Trump's unpredictability, which is making the U.S. "We are mourning the United States that we knew … which was very similar in values and institutions to Europe," he said. "Now it looks more like an emerging country." Euronext operates markets in various European cities, including Paris, Milan, Amsterdam, Brussels and Dublin. Historical allies the U.S. and European Union should have zero tariffs between them, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen urged amid the bloc's ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of 20% White House duties it was slapped with last week. The EU has previously expressed willingness to take steps against Washington if negotiations fail, but it has yet to specify the nature and extent of these potential countermeasures. Trump will sign energy-related Executive Orders this afternoon, and deliver a speech to House Republicans this evening, according to the White House schedule. 3:00 p.m.    Trump participates in an Unleashing American Energy Executive Order signing event White House East Room6:45 p.m.   Trump delivers remarks at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinnerThe National Building Museum U.S. markets are poised to open higher this morning, after three days of steep losses. Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rebounded 747 points, or 2%. Asian markets also closed higher Tuesday, staunching a decline fueled by Trump's tariff rollout that has seen the biggest losses since the pandemic. Von der Leyen and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held "constructive" talks today that touch on a possible mechanism for trade diversion in the wake of sweeping levies announced by the world's first economy. "In response to the widespread disruption caused by the US tariffs, President von der Leyen stressed the responsibility of Europe and China, as two of world's largest markets, to support a strong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field," according to an EU readout, which added that von der Leyen called for a "negotiated resolution to the current situation" that avoids escalation. "The leaders discussed setting up a mechanism for tracking possible trade diversion and ensuring any developments are duly addressed," the readout said. Speculation has been mounting whether Trump's protectionist agenda will push U.S. trade partners toward China in a bid to redress commercial relations. Beijing has already retaliated with its own 34% levies on the U.S., which is now threatening further countermeasures. Greer's testimony will offer the Senate one of its first opportunities to question a Trump administration official about the president's trade and tariff policy since Trump unveiled the sweeping new tariff regime. ET, and CNBC.com will stream the hearing on our liveblog. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez will visit China and Vietnam later this week, as Europe prepares to absorb the impacts of a new 20% tariff rate. Sanchez is scheduled to visit Hanoi on Wednesday, the same day the new Trump tariff rates go into effect. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit Last week the 30-year fixed rate dropped to the lowest level since last October after President Donald Trump announced global tariffs. "Last week's drop was a knee-jerk reaction that priced in more dire economic expectations," said Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. "So far this week, bonds are less panicked after several officials have discussed tariff negotiations and deals. Just this morning, when [Treasury Secretary Scott] Bessent referred to tariffs as a melting ice cube, we saw an immediate reaction in the market. Bottom line, rates took a lead off last week as economic fears surged. Now they're back on base and waiting for the next pitch," he said. The initial drop in mortgage rates last week had housing watchers cheering a potential boost to the lackluster spring market. Mortgage rates had been moving in a very narrow range since the end of February, lower than last year, but not by much. Homebuyers are also contending with high, and still rising, home prices, as well as dwindling confidence in the broader economy and their own employment. "The spring housing season is beginning with more sellers and a growing number of homes for sale," said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in its March housing report. "But the high cost of buying coupled with growing economic concerns suggest a sluggish response from buyers in early spring." The biggest drop in rates so far this year came not last week, but in January and February, when the 30-year fixed mortgage fell from a high of 7.26% to 6.74%. Despite that decline, pending home sales, which are a measure of initial signed contracts on existing homes, and therefore the most recent indicator of activity, rose just 2% in February from January, according to the National Association of Realtors. "Despite the modest monthly increase, contract signings remain well below normal historical levels," said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. "A meaningful decline in mortgage rates would help both demand and supply – demand by boosting affordability, and supply by lessening the power of the mortgage rate lock-in effect." The next significant move in mortgage rates could come as the market digests new economic data, namely Thursday's consumer price index and Friday's produce price index reports. Both have a strong track record of influencing rate momentum. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit This was CNBC's live blog covering European markets. European markets closed broadly higher on Tuesday, breaking a four-day losing streak fueled by red-hot global tariff tensions. The regional Stoxx 600 index closed 2.72% higher at 486.9 points. It comes after the Stoxx 600 index ended Monday's session around 4.5% lower, falling to its lowest closing level since January 2024, following days of market volatility and extreme selling. Amid some dip buying, investors also appeared hopeful the U.S. will begin talks that could lead to deals that lower the duties over time. The world has been rocked by the frequent updates around U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs regime in recent days, and despite stock gains, tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners do not appear to be easing. Speculation on Monday about a potential tariff pause was quickly shut down by the White House, while Trump threatened to hike tariffs on China by another 50% unless it scrapped retaliatory duties. Beijing last week imposed a 34% tariff on American products in response to Trump announcing his full list of so-called reciprocal tariffs. Overnight, China's Commerce Ministry said it "resolutely opposes" Trump's threat of escalating tariffs and vowed to take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests. Also on Monday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU had offered Trump a "zero-for-zero tariffs" deal for industrial goods, and reiterated that the bloc was keen to negotiate but was also prepared to impose countermeasures. Trump promptly rejected the EU's 0% tariff offer, however. European stock markets closed higher on Tuesday, with the Stoxx 600 index closing up 2.72%. Gains were broad-based, with France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX both up around 2.5%, as the U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 2.7%. The Bank of England is unlikely to overreact and press the "panic button" toward aggressive monetary policy easing as a result of the British currency's underperformance amid U.S. tariffs, according to Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury. Sterling was up 0.4% against the dollar at 12:18 p.m. in London. It was also up almost 0.2% against the euro. Yet, investors appear to be punishing GBP given its high-risk status and elevated interest rates, which allow room for aggressive easing under a scenario where the Bank of England presses the panic button on the growth outlook." Ebury is "confident that this underperformance won't last for too much longer," Ryan noted. "We don't expect the MPC to overreact to the tariffs, and the economic hit will probably transpire to be relatively minimal (troubles at home probably carry greater weight for Britain's economy in our view)," he added. James Moore, head of capital goods research at Redburn Atlantic, warns of U.S. stagflation and goods dumping in Europe as the Trump administration's tariffs escalate. London's FTSE 100 led gains among Europe's major bourses on Tuesday, trading 1.6% higher by 11:33 a.m. U.K. time. The U.K.'s FTSE AIM All-Share index was up by almost 2%. London-listed shares of British Airways owner IAG jumped 5.1%, while Rolls-Royce added 5% and Games Workshop rose by 4.2%. European alcohol producers made broad gains on Tuesday morning, after news emerged that the EU had exempted whiskey, wine and dairy products from its 25% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Diageo, which makes Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff and Guinness, was up by around 1% at 9:47 a.m. in London, while AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, gained 1.6%. In a note to clients on Tuesday, strategists at Swiss investment bank UBS argued that now is not the time to cash out of the stock market. "Even though the market may move even lower in the near term, periods of market stress have historically and consistently offered long-term rewards for diversified investors who look through near-term volatility, stay the course, and/or put fresh money to work," they said. "Staying invested also reduces the risk of missing significant "up days" for financial markets, which often occur during periods of high volatility," UBS' strategists added. Strong hedges in the current environment include medium-term bonds, gold, hedge funds and capital preservation, they said. Europe's Stoxx Aerospace and Defense index gained around 4% by 9:12 a.m. in London on Tuesday. It put the index on course to end a four-day losing streak, during which it notched single-session losses of up to 8%. "After multiple punishing sessions, stock markets appear to have started their road to recovery," Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said in a note on Tuesday. "It's dangerous to think a massive rally will definitely happen, given how [U.S. President Donald] Trump is unpredictable, but the 'just imagine' thought will now be firmly engrained in investors' minds," Mould said. It would only take a new sign of aggression from Trump or a trading partner fighting back hard to cause upset again. Market recoveries can quickly lose momentum if investors lose faith in a remedy to the situation that caused the original sell-off." The currency jumped higher in the immediate aftermath of Trump's reciprocal tariffs announcement on Wednesday, but pared some of those gains on Monday. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was 1.3% higher at 8:16 a.m. in London. Every sector barring telecom was in positive territory, with all major bourses edging higher. China's Commerce Ministry said it "resolutely opposes" U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of escalating tariffs, and vowed to take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests. The comments came after Trump said he would impose an additional 50% duties on U.S. imports from China Wednesday, if Beijing does not withdraw the 34% tariff it imposed on American products last week. Market participants traded about 29 billion shares on Monday, resulting in the highest volume day in at least 18 years, according to FactSet and Nasdaq Trader.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit The U.S. Justice Department abruptly shut down its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, signaling a major shift in how the federal government will handle crypto-related crimes going forward, according to a memo obtained by NBC News Tuesday. The memo, sent Monday night by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, outlines a decentralized approach in which U.S. The memo said efforts would focus on "prosecuting individuals who victimize digital asset investors, or those who use digital assets in furtherance of criminal offenses such as terrorism, narcotics and human trafficking, organized crime, hacking, and cartel and gang financing." This is the latest in a sweeping set of pro-crypto moves under President Donald Trump aimed at rolling back what his administration views as regulatory overreach.

Trump posted on Truth Social Tuesday that he had a "great call" with the acting president of South Korea, and that China "also wants to make a deal badly." This comes amid a series of comments from White House officials that the U.S. is in negotiation talks with trading partners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's told CNBC on Tuesday that around 70 countries had approached the U.S. for tariff negotiations. "If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals," Bessent said. The rebound come after three days of steep losses and violent volatility. The blue-chip index ultimately closed down by 349 points, or 0.9%. The S&P 500 briefly entered bear market territory at the lows of Monday's session, down more than 20% from its record, before rebounding slightly and finishing the session slightly lower. The benchmark lost 10% in two days to end last week, its worst losses since 2020 during the outbreak of Covid, on fears that Trump's shockingly high tariff rates on most of the world will lead to a recession. Despite Tuesday's gains on growing optimism for tariff negotiations, investors will need to see more stability in trade policy for the bounce to have legs, according to Robert Ruggirello, chief investment officer at Brave Eagle Wealth Management. "There has to be some staying power, something [where] corporations can make longer-term capital allocation decisions. Other megacap tech stocks were higher on the day, Nvidia and Meta Platforms gained around 5% each. The CBOE Volatility Index – known as Wall Street's so-called fear gauge – spiked to about 60 on Monday, an extreme level that could signal a technical bounce was due. Tuesday's stock rally was broad based, with 474 S&P 500 advancers during midday trading. All 11 S&P 500 sectors were trading in positive territory, with information technology the best-performing sector, while materials was the biggest laggard. Shares of Palantir Technologies and Western Digital climbed more than 8%, each. Humana was the top-performing stock, rallying along with other health care companies after Wall Street Journal reported the Trump administration will raise payment rates for Medicare insurers next year. Semiconductor funds on Tuesday headed for their best days in several months as the market rebounded. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) jumped more than 5% and 4%, respectively, as of shortly before 10:15 a.m. Both were tracking for their biggest one-day gains since August. Retail investor favorite Nvidia also climbed, with shares of the artificial intelligence titan popping more than 7%. Still, the SMH ETF has dropped more than 8% compared with where it traded five sessions earlier. The SOXX fund has plunged around 10% over that period. Month to date, the benchmark small cap index remains 7.3% lower following the broad selloff on fears President Donald Trump's tariff policy could lead to a recession. Apple's tumbling stock price presents an "enhanced buying opportunity for investors to own a high-quality name," said Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan The iPhone maker's shares have fallen about 25% so far this year due in large part to geopolitical uncertainty around Trump's tariffs and the delay of Siri features with artificial intelligence, Mohan said. It's possible that the risk of tariff escalation with China could pose a more severe threat to Wall Street's consensus estimates for Apple, Mohan said. But Apple has options to mitigate downside risk, including shifting production to India, increasing prices, change the pace of product releases, and wringing efficiencies out of its supply chain.

Monday's trading session saw the highest trading volume on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) since 2020, which could signal a short-term bottom in the stock market, according to BTIG technical strategist Jonathan Krinsky. "Over the past ten years, the four prior largest notional volume days all marked tactical lows, but all of those were re-tested and in some cases meaningfully broken over the ensuing weeks.

"We think this set-up is likely this time around in that we are seeing 'a' bottom for stocks and peak for VIX, but then re-test and possibly break to lower lows over the coming weeks/months," Krinsky continued.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk escalated his own sort of trade war Tuesday morning — not against another country, but against President Donald Trump's top trade advisor, Peter Navarro. He followed up by saying: "Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks." Less than 20 minutes later, Musk shot out yet another insult, correcting another user's spelling of Navarro's name with a play on the R-word: "*Peter Retarrdo." Tuesday's posts are the latest in a string of anti-tariff comments from Musk, who said over the weekend that America should establish a "zero-tariff" system with Europe. Musk, who has been heading up Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. "These are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and tariffs," she said. During a Sunday interview on Fox News, he said that Musk is great "when he's in his DOGE lane" but is protecting his own business interests when it comes to criticizing the wide-ranging tariffs Trump announced last week. During the same interview, Navarro said that things are "fine" between the two men and "there's no rift there." Yet Navarro turned up the heat on Monday when he appeared on CNBC, possibly prompting Musk's recent comments. He's a car assembler in many cases," Navarro said, saying that Tesla gets car parts from foreign nations. The markets continue to be roiled by the tariff chaos, with US stocks surging Tuesday morning after a painful three-day sell-off.</p>

The three major averages were on track for their best session since Nov. 2022. Trump posted on Truth Social Tuesday that he had a "great call" with the acting president of South Korea, and that China "also wants to make a deal badly." This comes amid a series of comments from White House officials that the U.S. is in negotiation talks with trading partners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's told CNBC on Tuesday that around 70 countries had approached the U.S. for tariff negotiations. "If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals," Bessent said. The rebound come after three days of steep losses and violent volatility. The blue-chip index ultimately closed down by 349 points, or 0.9%. The S&P 500 briefly entered bear market territory at the lows of Monday's session, down more than 20% from its record, before rebounding slightly and finishing the session slightly lower. The benchmark lost 10% in two days to end last week, its worst losses since 2020 during the outbreak of Covid, on fears that Trump's shockingly high tariff rates on most of the world will lead to a recession. Despite Tuesday's gains on growing optimism for tariff negotiations, investors will need to see more stability in trade policy for the bounce to have legs, according to Robert Ruggirello, chief investment officer at Brave Eagle Wealth Management. "There has to be some staying power, something [where] corporations can make longer-term capital allocation decisions. Other megacap tech stocks were higher on the day, Nvidia and Meta Platforms gained around 5% each.

Tuesday's stock rally was broad based, with 474 S&P 500 advancers during midday trading. All 11 S&P 500 sectors were trading in positive territory, with information technology the best-performing sector, while materials was the biggest laggard. Shares of Palantir Technologies and Western Digital climbed more than 8%, each. Humana was the top-performing stock, rallying along with other health care companies after Wall Street Journal reported the Trump administration will raise payment rates for Medicare insurers next year. Semiconductor funds on Tuesday headed for their best days in several months as the market rebounded. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) jumped more than 5% and 4%, respectively, as of shortly before 10:15 a.m. Both were tracking for their biggest one-day gains since August. Retail investor favorite Nvidia also climbed, with shares of the artificial intelligence titan popping more than 7%.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit This is CNBC's live coverage of how the White House, U.S. trade partners and employers are responding to President Donald Trump's historic tariffs. Subscribers accounted for nearly half of all spending on Walmart's website and app in its most recent fiscal year, the company told CNBC. That gives Walmart a few advantages if Trump's tariffs raise its input costs or trigger an economic downturn. As the memberships are highly profitable, they give Walmart room to keep prices of groceries and other staples low even if the company's expenses increase. Walmart+ is gaining ground at a good time for Walmart. The retailer gave a financial outlook that disappointed Wall Street in February — even before Trump announced the steep duties on key U.S. trade partners. "It's based on a fallacy" that "somehow, in a trade, someone must lose," Paul said on CNBC's "Squawk Box." California Rep. Ro Khanna says Trump's tariffs have been hitting his district in Silicon Valley hard, especially with delayed IPOs and mergers. "I'm hearing that these are some of the most self-destructive, wealth-destroying policies that any modern president has had," Khanna said on CNBC's "Squawk Box." Khanna also singled out Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, calling Lutnick's claim that tariffs would lead to more iPhone production false. "I know Lutnick loves 19th-century policies, but he should understand 21st-century production," Khanna said. "Bring in new people on an economic team, assure the country you're never going to do blanket tariffs again, that was a mistake, and that you're going to look at things sector by sector." Businesses and consumers want certainty as Trump's steep tariffs loom, says Levi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass. We need some clarity," she said on CNBC's "Mad Money." Levi's manufactures some of its products in countries like Cambodia and Vietnam, which will face 49% and 46% tariffs, respectively, under Trump's plan. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is sharply escalating his attacks on top Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro as he defends his car company and chafes against the administration's tariff plans. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks," Musk, Trump's top campaign donor, wrote on X, the social media platform he owns. What he says here is demonstrably false," Musk wrote in another post. Musk was responding to Navarro's contention in a CNBC interview on Monday that Musk is not a car manufacturer but a car "assembler" whose vehicles are made of many parts sourced from overseas. Days earlier, Musk in a since-deleted X post said Navarro "ain't built s---." Musk currently works for Trump as head of the White House DOGE initiative. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shrugged off questions about Musk's attacks on his colleague. Cambodia is being hit with the biggest single nation tariff rate of all, at 49%. This has major implications for its factories, now in a fight to survive the next few months if the tariffs are implemented, as retail partners freeze orders. Its one million workers, many of whom are women at the low-end of the global income distribution pie, are facing financial ruin. But a U.S. trade group that represents retailers reliant on Cambodia says factories now based in Cambodia will "absolutely not" be coming back to the U.S. Instead, they will seek out alternative manufacturing locations in lower tariff regimes. Read the full story: Cambodia, hit with Trump's steepest tariffs, 'absolutely not' sending factories back to U.S., says trade group Trump says China "wants to make a deal" as his deadline for steep new tariffs draws near, but adds that Beijing has not yet reached out to the United States. "They don't know how to get it started. Trump also held what he described as a "great call" with South Korea's acting president, Han Duck-soo. "We have the confines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries." U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says China is playing with a "losing hand" in the escalating tariff back-and-forth between the two countries. "I think it was a big mistake, this Chinese escalation, because they're playing with a pair of twos," Bessent said on "Squawk Box." "If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals," he said, "and part of the calculus of that may be that some part of the tariffs stay on." Last night, members of the administration discussed which countries to prioritize for trade talks, he added. Founder and CEO of Citadel Ken Griffin is taking aim at Trump's tariffs, calling them a a "huge policy mistake" that will hurt middle-class Americans. "Since this began, money is leaving the United States to be reinvested in Europe," Boujnah said in an interview with France Inter radio today. Investors, he said, are struggling to navigate Trump's unpredictability, which is making the U.S. "We are mourning the United States that we knew … which was very similar in values and institutions to Europe," he said. "Now it looks more like an emerging country." Euronext operates markets in various European cities, including Paris, Milan, Amsterdam, Brussels and Dublin. Historical allies the U.S. and European Union should have zero tariffs between them, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen urged amid the bloc's ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of 20% White House duties it was slapped with last week. The EU has previously expressed willingness to take steps against Washington if negotiations fail, but it has yet to specify the nature and extent of these potential countermeasures. Trump will sign energy-related Executive Orders this afternoon, and deliver a speech to House Republicans this evening, according to the White House schedule. 3:00 p.m.    Trump participates in an Unleashing American Energy Executive Order signing event White House East Room6:45 p.m.   Trump delivers remarks at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinnerThe National Building Museum U.S. markets are poised to open higher this morning, after three days of steep losses. Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rebounded 747 points, or 2%. Asian markets also closed higher Tuesday, staunching a decline fueled by Trump's tariff rollout that has seen the biggest losses since the pandemic. Von der Leyen and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held "constructive" talks today that touch on a possible mechanism for trade diversion in the wake of sweeping levies announced by the world's first economy. "In response to the widespread disruption caused by the US tariffs, President von der Leyen stressed the responsibility of Europe and China, as two of world's largest markets, to support a strong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field," according to an EU readout, which added that von der Leyen called for a "negotiated resolution to the current situation" that avoids escalation. "The leaders discussed setting up a mechanism for tracking possible trade diversion and ensuring any developments are duly addressed," the readout said. Speculation has been mounting whether Trump's protectionist agenda will push U.S. trade partners toward China in a bid to redress commercial relations. Beijing has already retaliated with its own 34% levies on the U.S., which is now threatening further countermeasures. Greer's testimony will offer the Senate one of its first opportunities to question a Trump administration official about the president's trade and tariff policy since Trump unveiled the sweeping new tariff regime.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stocks extended their losses on Monday, with all three benchmark indexes diving into the red and the S&P 500 briefly entering a bear market as Trump doubled down on his resolve to lower the trade deficit. Here's what Wall Street's top minds have been saying this week. The US is likely already mired in a downturn — and stocks could plummet another 20% before they find a bottom, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said. Still, he said the sell-off in stocks looked like "more of a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity," adding that he didn't believe tariffs were creating systemic risks to the economy. Economic chaos is likely if Trump doesn't pause or scale back tariffs immediately, the billionaire hedge funder Bill Ackman said Monday in a post on X. In a separate post, Ackman said his firm wouldn't dump its US stock holdings even if tariff fears sparked a massive price drop. "We will suffer mark-to-market losses if the market crashes, but we will not be sellers in a declining market," Ackman said, adding: "Over the long term, we are exposed to the health of our country and its economy. This is my only investment 'conflict' if you want to call it that." That's because Trump's trade war could rattle the bond market and spark a wave of bankruptcies, he told Bloomberg TV. I believe you cannot put the genie back in the bottle," Weinstein told the outlet in an interview published on Monday, pointing to reciprocal tariffs from China and other knock-on effects from Trump's tariff plan. "There might be something in between that stops the boulder, but I'm very concerned about a crash," he said. In his annual letter to shareholders on Monday, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of the impact of tariffs, saying the steep duties on US imports could slow growth and raise inflation. "The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession," the billionaire banker wrote. Dimon also mentioned stagflation, a scenario where economic growth stagnates while inflation stays high. Stanley Druckenmiller reiterated his stance against tariffs in an X post on Monday. "I do not support tariffs exceeding 10% which I made abundantly clear in the interview you cite," the top investor wrote in response to another post, which featured a clip of a previous CNBC interview. In the interview, Druckenmiller said he saw tariffs within "the 10% range" as the "lesser of two evils," adding that he believed that duties on US imports were "simply a consumption tax" partly paid for by foreign countries. Trump's tariffs are having "very big impacts on markets and economies," but there should be more focus on what caused them and the even greater disruptions ahead, Ray Dalio said in a LinkedIn post on Monday. "The far bigger, far more important thing to keep in mind is that we are seeing a classic breakdown of the major monetary, political, and geopolitical orders," he wrote, adding this kind of event only happened about once in a lifetime. He also pointed to increasingly disruptive acts of nature and technological innovations such as AI as key drivers of the ongoing changes. Trump went too far with his tariffs, leaving investors shellshocked and the economy in danger, Brad Gerstner, the founder and CEO of Altimeter Capital, told Fox Business on Monday. "These are not reciprocal tariffs — this is a nuclear-style assault on global business and it's gonna land us in a recession." The veteran tech investor said Trump needs to show Wall Street he wants fair tariffs and isn't "trying to unwind the entire global system of trade which has worked really well for America." The US can't "just push a button and magically this all resets."</p>

Now 24 and working at a nonprofit in San Diego, she's nervous that she's about to relive the not-so-glory days of her youth after years of slowly mounting economic anxiety. With President Donald Trump's trade war in full swing, many see the probability of a downturn rising. Business Insider spoke to two boomers, a millennial, and two Gen Zers about what they're making of a possible economic slump. Martinson, a Gen Zer, said she's always been frugal and isn't too nervous about losing her job, but she feels increased pressure to save money. Michelle Husberg, 62, credits some of her previous recession luck to the saving habits she developed as a young person. A retired nurse, she and her husband never lost jobs or a house or impulsively withdrew all their money from the stock market. They kind of instilled that in me," Husberg said. She's saved money since landing her first job at age 20 and called her dad, a firm believer in the stock market, as a young adult to figure out how much to contribute to her 401(k). Between her husband's pension and Social Security, the two of them don't have to withdraw funds to cover their basic expenses. Most of their money has been invested in the stock market for decades; Husberg remembers watching her savings vanish seemingly overnight in 2001 and 2008. "It is hard when you see the money go, especially when it drops in half," Husberg said of her investments. Gene Cain, a retired 71-year-old, wasn't so fortunate. Now, Cain relies on his Social Security check and lives month-to-month. I know it was a dumb thing to do, but it was what we had to do at the time." Casandra King, a 37-year-old HR manager, said the shadow of 2008 has "impacted me greatly." King, a millennial, graduated from college in 2010 and wasn't able to start saving then. She'd been worried about paying her bills since she was a junior during the Great Recession when she got a job working at Godiva Chocolates to stay afloat and crashed on friends' couches after losing her housing. Ava Hannah, a Gen Zer pursuing a nursing degree at the University of Central Arkansas, barely remembers previous recessions — she was three in 2008 and more focused on "TV and snacks" than market slides — but knows enough to be a little freaked. Hannah and her friends have talked about the possibility of a recession a bit, mainly over meals in the cafeteria. "Usually it's full of jokes, because I don't know what's going to happen, but there's a real underlying element not of despair, but worry at least," she said. "I think a bunch of other kids on campus are also talking about it, because we're all college kids, we don't have money. Husberg is mainly worried about how a recession could impact others, especially people in their 20s, and isn't changing her own habits much to prepare. After landing a new job recently, Martinson became a little looser with her spending but has since abandoned that mindset. She's started listening to news podcasts first thing each morning again, a habit she developed during the pandemic but later dropped. "I'm nervous, and my body and brain are aware of this routine that another historical event is happening," she said. King, the HR manager, is reexamining her family's spending — she and her husband have two kids — to cut out any waste, knowing that things might "seem really crappy for a long time."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In her email, Noem said the buyout offer generally wasn't being extended to law enforcement officials, which includes ICE agents. "As a general rule, Law Enforcement Officials will be exempt from participation in these programs due to their essential mission-critical responsibilities," she wrote. According to Noem's email, the lump sum policy would be considered severance pay. It's not clear whether the offer would follow the Office of Personnel Management's severance pay formula for federal employees. Representatives for DHS did not answer questions about how the offer would work and how many employees received it. "The American people deserve a government that works for them, something President Trump has promised." DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. "Every dollar spent and position filled at DHS should be focused on our core mission of securing our homeland and keeping the American people safe." Employees have until April 14 to decide whether they want to take the offer, which was meant to "reflect our commitment to aligning our workforce with evolving mission needs," Noem wrote in the email, which had the subject line "Reshaping of the DHS workforce." I am writing to share important news regarding new voluntary workforce transition programs approved for immediate implementation across the Department. Components will provide guidance for which of these three programs are available to their respective workforce, to include populations who are excluded from our mission critical frontline workforce. As a general rule, Law Enforcement Officials will be exempt from participation in these programs due to their essential mission-critical responsibilities. This program offers eligible employees a structured and supported path to transition from DHS. Those who choose to participate will receive a brief period of paid administrative leave to complete key tasks, submit retirement documentation, and prepare for departure. Most transitions under this program are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2025, though exact dates may vary depending on individual circumstances. S§ 8336(d)(2) (CSRS) and 8414(b)(1)(B) (FERS), VERA allows eligible employees who meet certain age and service requirements to retire early. This option helps employees who are ready to retire while ensuring DHS can address evolving needs across our Components. Often referred to as a "buyout," this option offers a lump-sum payment of up to $25,000 (or an amount equal to severance pay if lower) for employees in roles slated for voluntary departures. By offering these options, we intend to provide flexibility for employees who may be considering a change, retirement, or new career opportunities, while also supporting the Department's operational readiness. If you believe any or all of these programs might be right for you, please watch for further announcements from your Component leadership or Human Resources office, where you will find more specific eligibility criteria, detailed instructions, and timelines. Your decision to apply for any of these programs will be due NLT 11:59 ET on April 14, 2025. If you have any questions in the meantime, please reach out to your HR office or supervisor for additional guidance.</p>
