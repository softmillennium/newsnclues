                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MrBeast has a new game: work for Beast Industries without stealing company secrets. According to Jimmy Donaldson (better known as MrBeast) and his company, a former employee failed the challenge. He allegedly started working on servers that “housed post-production Beast content” and he subcontracted out some of the tasks to Vine Networks, an IT company managed by Nabors' daughter. That apparently went well, as Nabors was moved to a “special projects” team in late 2023 as a full employee, working with the company's development department tasked with handling “content production,” “fundraising,” and “political advocacy”—all work that was outside of the IT tasks that he was initially brought in to do. Nabors worked on that team until October 1, 2024, when he was fired according to the complaint. After Nabors was fired (the complaint doesn't go into the details as to the why of that termination), Beast Industries discovered that they had allegedly downloaded “more than one thousand Beast confidential files from the Company's Google Vault,” including documents that the company claims were “highly confidential” and contained information about “business strategy, financial information, capitalization tables, financing documents, individual employee personal information, and other MrBeast intellectual property.” Nabors allegedly downloaded those files on September 23, 2024—just over a week before he was let go—because he sensed that his firing was coming. In addition to discovering the documents had been downloaded, Beast personnel apparently also spotted cameras installed around the office after Nabors' departure. A 2022 lawsuit alleged that he “diverted millions of dollars in revenue and profits” from Edu-Net, an IT company he started, to HSC Solutions, a competing company run by his daughter. But things have been getting mighty litigious in the MrBeast universe lately, too. Donaldson and his company were sued last year by contestants on his Amazon show Beast Games for sexual harassment and chronic mistreatment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During the meeting, Oz discussed possibly prioritizing AI avatars over frontline health care workers. Oz also claimed that patients have rated the care they've received from an AI avatar as equal to or better than a human doctor. (Research suggests patients are actually more skeptical of medical advice given by AI.) Because of technologies like machine learning and AI, Oz claimed, it is now possible to scale “good ideas” in an affordable and fast way. CMS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Senate confirmed Oz as CMS's new administrator on April 3. CMS, which runs Medicare, Medicaid, and Healthcare.gov, is part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), where health care conspiracist RFK Jr. currently serves as department secretary. “Please join incoming CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz and other senior leaders to learn more about his vision and priorities for CMS,” stated the meeting description, which was called for Monday at 1:00 pm EST. “This is an internal event, and all CMS staff are invited to participate virtually. Staff who are onsite at CMS office locations should consider gathering in available offices or conference space.” Oz has seemingly never worked in health care policy before, but served as a physician for many years before becoming the star of The Dr. Oz Show. He has promoted a number of provably incorrect medical tips—including the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as a treatment for Covid—and weight-loss pills that Oz admitted in a 2014 Senate subcommittee hearing “don't have the scientific muster to present as fact.” He also unsuccessfully ran for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, losing to current senator John Fetterman. Oz told CMS employees that it was their “patriotic duty” to take care of themselves as it would help decrease the cost of health care, citing the costs of running Medicare and Medicaid throughout the country. (During his Senate confirmation hearing for CMS administrator, Oz also claimed “it is our patriotic duty to be healthy,” connecting personal exercise to the overall reduction of expenses for Medicare and Medicaid.) He said that addressing obesity was one of his top priorities. (The Biden administration had suggested that Medicare and Medicaid cover costs for weight-loss drugs, an initiative that the Trump administration has so far declined to expand. “I'm not sure he knows what we do here,” said one CMS employee who listened to the call. When asked how he would prefer to be briefed on complex policy issues, Oz told staffers, You'll find that I am not purposely but deliberately naive about a lot of issues. Sources tell WIRED that this seemed to them like a roundabout way for Oz to say that he is focused not on personal or political motivations, but the facts. Oz also endorsed MAHA: Make America Healthy Again, an HHS priority that was originally a cornerstone of RFK Jr.'s 2024 presidential campaign. In the CMS meeting, Oz stated that MAHA is all about “curiosity.” (Kennedy, who has championed MAHA, has also repeatedly and dangerously promoted anti-vaccine opinions, doctors, and activists.) “Reinforcements are coming to the agency,” Oz said, speaking of doctors and clinicians he claims have been left behind or left out of CMS's work; or even those who wouldn't have previously wanted to work at CMS before. “That was frankly insulting to the CMS staff,” says a source.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new company, Deep Cogito, has emerged from stealth with a family of openly available AI models that can be switched between “reasoning” and non-reasoning modes. Reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 have shown great promise in domains like math and physics, thanks to their ability to effectively fact-check themselves by working through complex problems step by step. This reasoning comes at a cost, however: higher computing and latency. Hybrid models can quickly answer simple questions while spending additional time considering more challenging queries. “Each model can answer directly […] or self-reflect before answering (like reasoning models),” the company explained in a blog post. Deep Cogito built on top of Meta's open Llama and Alibaba's Qwen models to create its own. Cogito 70B with reasoning disabled also eclipses Meta's recently released Llama 4 Scout model on LiveBench, a general-purpose AI test. “Currently, we're still in the early stages of [our] scaling curve, having used only a fraction of compute typically reserved for traditional large language model post/continued training,” wrote Cogito in its blog post. According to filings with California State, San Francisco-based Deep Cogito was founded in June 2024. The company's LinkedIn page lists two co-founders, Drishan Arora and Dhruv Malhotra. Malhotra was previously a product manager at Google AI lab DeepMind, where he worked on generative search technology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta cheated on an AI benchmark, and that is hilarious. The new models are Scout, a smaller model intended for quick queries, and Maverick, which is meant to be a super efficient rival to more well-known models like OpenAi's GPT-4o (the harbinger of our Miyazaki apocalypse). In the blog post announcing them, Meta did what every AI company now does with a major release. They dropped a whole bunch of highly technical data to brag about how Meta's AI was smarter and more efficient than models from companies better associated with AI: Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. These release posts are always mired in deeply technical data and benchmarks that are hugely beneficial to researchers and the most AI obsessive, but kind of useless for the rest of us. But plenty of AI obsessives immediately noticed one shocking benchmark result Meta highlighted in its post. LMArena is an open-source collaborative benchmarking tool where users can vote on the best output. A higher score is better and Maverick's 1417 put it in the number 2 spot on LMArena's leaderboard, just above GPT-4o and just below Gemini 2.5 Pro. The company had programmed this model to be more chatty than usual. It doesn't seem like LMArena was pleased with the charm offensive. “Meta's interpretation of our policy did not match what we expect from model providers,” it said in a statement on X. “Meta should have made it clearer that ‘Llama-4-Maverick-03-26-Experimental' was a customized model to optimize for human preference. As a result of that we are updating our leaderboard policies to reinforce our commitment to fair, reproducible evaluations so this confusion doesn't occur in the future.” I love LMArena's optimism here because gaming a benchmark feels like a right of passage in consumer technology and I suspect this trend will continue. I've been covering consumer technology for over a decade, I once ran one of the more extensive benchmarking labs in the industry, and I have seen plenty of phone and laptop makers attempt all kinds of tricks to juice their scores. Now AI models are getting more chatty to juice their scores too. And the reason I suspect this won't be the last carefully cultivated score is that right now these companies are desperate to distinguish their large language models from one another. If every model can help you write a shitty English paper five minutes before class then you'll need another reason to distinguish your preference. As these AIs continue to mature into actual consumer-facing products we'll start seeing more benchmark bragging. These companies are going to need to prove why their models are the best models and benchmarks alone won't do that. Not when a chatty bot can game the system so easily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. If there's one word on your mind this week, it's probably tariffs. Last week, President Trump announced sweeping tariffs on foreign goods imported into the US, setting the stage for a global trade war and stoking fears of a recession. In short, that fee affects their bottom line, so companies often pass those costs on to consumers by increasing the price of the goods. Here's an example from Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University: Let's say a laptop costs $400 at import in the US. That's the price you'll pay at a big box store. (Update: The White House now says China tariffs will be 104 percent, according to CNBC.) Every country has been affected by Trump's tariff salvo. While many product categories will likely see prices rise, electronics is a big one. That will heavily impact the prices of goods like smartphones, laptops, and video game consoles. Smartphones are the largest import from China, with laptops sitting in second. Miller says it's important for consumers to understand that while there were tariffs on some goods from China before, there were zero tariffs on electronics like smartphones and laptops as of January 2025. You likely won't see prices rise for a few months as companies have stocked up on goods ahead of the impending trade war, but if nothing changes in the coming weeks, Miller expects to see prices soar starting in June or July. Miller rattled off various categories outside of electronics that would also be affected, specifically from China, which is the second largest source of imports to the US behind Mexico: Outside of higher prices, Miller says consumers should expect less product variety. “What importers are going to do is they're only going to import their most profitable, best-selling items for which they know they can still make a profit under these tariff regimes.” Apple will still import its iPhones, but a smaller smartphone maker that doesn't sell many units of a specific model may skip the US market entirely. It will also negatively impact any product where there's already a lot of consumer sensitivity to price increases. A few companies have already made tariff-related announcements on their products. Nintendo canceled the original April 9 preorder date for the Switch 2 video game console and has yet to provide a new date, though its June 5 launch window hasn't changed. Jaguar Land Rover Automotive is pausing auto shipments to the US this month. Razer seems to have paused direct sales of its laptops in the US, though the company hasn't responded to our request for comment. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. WIRED reached out to more than 70 companies, from electronics manufacturers to coffee companies, asking if they could share any details about potential price increases on imported products. The vast majority, like Garmin, Oura, Amazon, Logitech, OnePlus, and Steelcase, declined to comment, while others said it was too early to discuss pricing. Popular home office furniture brand, Branch, says it has been preparing for trade policy changes for some time, finding efficiencies in its supply chain to absorb the impact of tariffs with minimal increases to pricing. The company says there's a lot of uncertainty: “Candidly, we may need to adjust some prices in the coming months, particularly for products sourced from countries where tariff rates came in significantly higher than we anticipated.” Branch says if there is a price change, it will be to protect margins rather than to expand them. It's worth noting that Branch's Ergonomic Chair, long recommended in WIRED's Best Office Chairs guide, used to be $339 but is now $359, though Branch says the price was adjusted before tariffs were announced. Drip coffee maker Moccamaster says it may absorb “some short-term pressures at the US level," though it's too early to confirm whether prices will increase. Portland-based coffee machine maker Ratio says it's holding prices steady through April, but “tariffs this high will unequivocally compel higher retail prices—potentially much higher. We are a small business that was already struggling with increasing costs.” The company behind smart bird feeders from brands like Harymor and Sehmua, says it's exploring strategies to absorb costs internally, with no price adjustments—"We are facing rising expenses that directly affect our profit margins. Meanwhile, Samsung hasn't responded to our request for comment yet, but the company told Reuters the tariffs don't affect its TVs as much since most are produced in Mexico. While it's too early to make a definitive statement on an ever-evolving situation, we can probably expect higher prices on almost everything if the tariff situation remains unchanged. The last thing we want is for everyone to panic buy, but if you need a new phone, a mechanical keyboard, or an air purifier, you should probably start looking now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These are creatures that have been extinct for more than 12,000 years and made famous by the HBO show “Game of Thrones.” These white, fluffy animals live on a 2,000-acre preserve in a location so secretive that journalists, including from TechCrunch, who were invited to view the live animals, were not invited to the compound itself, located in the northern United States. Instead we flew to another secretive location to see the animals with our own eyes because in this age of AI, a photo can't be trusted. There we saw two six-month-old males named Remus and Romulus, each already weighing about 80 pounds. In addition to Remus and Romulus, the company's engineered dire wolf pack includes a female named Khaleesi, who is two months old. When Colossal Biosciences announced its latest fundraise at a $10.2 billion valuation earlier this year, the company's co-founder and CEO Ben Lamm told TechCrunch he believed the startup was undervalued given its actual scientific progress. Given the common startup tendency to overstate capabilities, it wasn't easy to take Lamm's claims at face value, particularly since Colossal's ambitious de-extinction projects for the woolly mammoth and Tasmanian tiger were not slated for completion until 2028. Last month, the company announced that it engineered a mouse with mammoth-like fur. The genetically modified cells were turned into embryos, which were implanted into a large domestic dog, who then gave birth to the dire wolf pups. But many scientists who are not working for Colossal question whether they represent a true species revival. “It is an impressive feat of genome editing, but I would not call it de-extinction,” David Gold, a professor of Paleobiology at UC Davis, told TechCrunch. These animals are not being raised in a pack by other dire wolves, and they are not hunting in the wild, so I suspect their behavior will be different from a real dire wolf as well.” That sentiment was echoed by Alexander Young, a professor of statistical genetics at UCLA, who wrote on X, “This seems massively overhyped. That's a cool achievement but they have not ‘brought the dire wolf back' sorry.” He added that only 0.3% of gray wolves' genes were altered to make the dire wolf, and the remaining 0.2% variation was ultimately left unchanged. Since we know that Remus, Romulus, and Khaleesi are not 100% identical to the animals that roamed the world until about 12,000 years ago, can we really call them de-extincted dire wolves? Dire wolves represented the ideal confluence of factors for a cash-rich startup that claims to be ethically conscious and has many entertainment-savvy investors on its cap table. “We like to pair de-extinction with conservation projects,” Lamm said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These are creatures that have been extinct for more than 12,000 years and made famous by the HBO show “Game of Thrones.” These white, fluffy animals live on a 2,000-acre preserve in a location so secretive that journalists, including from TechCrunch, who were invited to view the live animals, were not invited to the compound itself, located in the northern United States. Instead we flew to another secretive location to see the animals with our own eyes because in this age of AI, a photo can't be trusted. There we saw two six-month-old males named Remus and Romulus, each already weighing about 80 pounds. In addition to Remus and Romulus, the company's engineered dire wolf pack includes a female named Khaleesi, who is two months old. When Colossal Biosciences announced its latest fundraise at a $10.2 billion valuation earlier this year, the company's co-founder and CEO Ben Lamm told TechCrunch he believed the startup was undervalued given its actual scientific progress. Given the common startup tendency to overstate capabilities, it wasn't easy to take Lamm's claims at face value, particularly since Colossal's ambitious de-extinction projects for the woolly mammoth and Tasmanian tiger were not slated for completion until 2028. Last month, the company announced that it engineered a mouse with mammoth-like fur. The genetically modified cells were turned into embryos, which were implanted into a large domestic dog, who then gave birth to the dire wolf pups. But many scientists who are not working for Colossal question whether they represent a true species revival. “It is an impressive feat of genome editing, but I would not call it de-extinction,” David Gold, a professor of Paleobiology at UC Davis, told TechCrunch. These animals are not being raised in a pack by other dire wolves, and they are not hunting in the wild, so I suspect their behavior will be different from a real dire wolf as well.” That sentiment was echoed by Alexander Young, a professor of statistical genetics at UCLA, who wrote on X, “This seems massively overhyped. That's a cool achievement but they have not ‘brought the dire wolf back' sorry.” He added that only 0.3% of gray wolves' genes were altered to make the dire wolf, and the remaining 0.2% variation was ultimately left unchanged. Since we know that Remus, Romulus, and Khaleesi are not 100% identical to the animals that roamed the world until about 12,000 years ago, can we really call them de-extincted dire wolves? Dire wolves represented the ideal confluence of factors for a cash-rich startup that claims to be ethically conscious and has many entertainment-savvy investors on its cap table. “We like to pair de-extinction with conservation projects,” Lamm said. The state had been trying to save them from disappearing. We can bring back a species that's culturally relevant, that our indigenous partners care about, and we can use the technologies to save the red wolves,” Lamm said. Colossal is also talking to indigenous communities about possibly re-wilding the dire wolves on their lands.

Corsair's Frame 4000D is a thermally effective, reasonably priced, lightweight case that promises future upgrade options. But what's more important, at least in the short term, is that the Frame 4000D delivers a compelling combination of effective thermal performance in a lightweight package that's priced reasonably, at only $94.99 USD. Will Corsair's 4000D make our list of best PC cases? When I first picked up the box containing this case (it's available in black or white), I was surprised by how light it was. Many CPU coolers I have tested weigh more. At first glance, things might seem fairly typical for a case that supports back-connect motherboards like MSI's Project Zero – cable management bar on the right, front intake next to the bar. And Corsair claims that billet aluminum upgrades will be available in the future. In the default configuration using front intake fans, there is a cable management bar with a built-in, adjustable GPU holder next to the motherboard (shown above). However, you can switch out the cable management bar with a fan-holding frame to enable the use of side intake fans (shown below). This case can be equipped with up to 12 fans, and supports 360mm radiators in the front, top, or side-mounted. The case features multiple dust filters, which are fairly easy to remove. ▶️ Rear side view, storage, and cable management features The default configuration has both a cable management bar with velcro straps and a routing path with straps to keep things tidy. Here's a more detailed look at the storage plate: The included IO panel has (from left to right) a power button, audio jack, Two USB-A ports, and a USB-C port. As part of its modularity claims, Corsair says an upgraded IO panel will be available for purchase in Q2 2025. The rear view seems pretty standard, but there are a few things to note that stand out from the competition.The PCIe slots are removable because the case includes support for both vertical and horizontal GPU mounting. Ocypus Iota A62 WH dual-tower cooler, configured with a single fan The style, price, features, and noise levels of a case (if the case includes fans) should also be considered – and we all have different preferences. What I might like in a case, you might not, and that's OK. My goal with these reviews is to give everyone, no matter their preferences, enough information to decide whether or not a product is right for them. The Frame 4000D can be configured in multiple ways: Both front and side-mounted intake fans are supported. The other set of benchmarks will show performance with system and CPU fans speeds set to 30% for those who prefer silently running systems. All cases shown in the benchmarks have been tested with Ocypus Gamma F12 BK ARGB fans for consistency. Albert Thomas is a contributor for Tom's Hardware, primarily covering CPU cooling reviews.

The system is based on the Telum II processor that offers both 70% higher general-purpose performance over its predecessor as well as 50% improved AI capabilities. For those who need even higher AI performance, IBM offers to install additional Spyre accelerators. The Telum II CPU features eight advanced cores operating at 5.5 GHz, featuring enhanced branch prediction, store writeback, and address translation. Additionally, Telum II integrates a data processing unit (DPU) to accelerate transactional workloads, which the company says increases overall system responsiveness. The chip is manufactured using Samsung's 5HPP fabrication process and contains 43 billion transistors. However, the Telum II does not only boast enhanced performance. A central element of this processor is its upgraded AI unit, which delivers four times the compute capability of the previous generation, reaching 24 trillion operations per second with INT8 data precision. However, the NPU is designed for mission-critical time-sensitive application that supports ensemble AI methods (traditional machine learning with a large-language model) to detect suspicious activities and fraud attempts. It should be noted that every AI unit within a processor drawer can accept tasks from any of the CPU cores. This ensures even distribution of processing demands and enables the full use of the available 192 trillion operations per second per drawer when all accelerators are active. IBM understands that some workloads will require more AI performance. Hence, alongside its Telum II, IBM unveiled the Spyre AI accelerator card with a PCIe interface. This 26-billion transistor processor packs 32 AI cores and features an architecture that closely resembles that of the AI accelerator architecture found in Telum II and, therefore, can be used to dynamically expand AI capabilities and performance of z17 drawers. "The industry is quickly learning that AI will only be as valuable as the infrastructure it runs on," said Ross Mauri, general manager of IBM Z and LinuxONE, IBM. Additionally, organizations can put their vast, untapped stores of enterprise data to work with AI in a secured, cost-effective way." To support AI workloads at the system level, IBM intends to introduce its z/OS 3.2 in Q3 2025, an updated version of its mainframe operating system.

Traditionally, for IBM's z mainframes, the new z17 features robust security capabilities, including a new tool called IBM Vault, originally developed by HashiCorp to handle credentials, keys, and tokens across hybrid environments. As for storage, IBM's z17 will use the company's IBM DS8000 Gen10 system, which is designed to support high-speed transactions, availability, and scalability for mission-critical operations.

GitMatcher is primarily aimed at the sourcing stage, where recruiters can find devs based on their actual code contributions. This is a good idea, but it needs more work on how to tokenize and index the profiles. because API for exact matches misses a lot of profiles. The location field in GitHub has been always been inconsistent, some people use country flag emojis instead of names, or just abbreviations like AR, BO, or USA, etc I also have a self-updating github readme, it commits everyday you also might want to check all the links in your footer. Basically all of the major tech companies have boilerplate hoops you need to jump through to make open source contributions on the side, let alone open source anything major internally. Also, while Github is big indeed, most public repositories are either concerned with open source software, are of low quality, are just cloning other software.Most developers don't have their work in public git repositories. Most developers don't have their work in public git repositories. It can also be gamed by just filling your repo with all sorts of stuff pulled from elsewhere. I appreciate your thoughts — it helps make GitMatcher better. Why would Github commits more significant when discovering people than LinkedIn CVS? HN is doing a good job of complaining about all the edge cases where this won't work because most of us don't contribute high-quality, novel work to GH.</p>

Many notable FLOSS projects have their own organisations on GH. People who produce a lot of that code have direct commit access and don't keep forks on their profiles. You're missing all of the most prolific developers here. - Location field in a GH profile is full of jokes. It picked one repo that is not in my profile and wasn't there probably for a long time, and another that is a public archive and hasn't been updated since 2017. Both are forks with minimal contributions on my part. I have pinned repos in my profile that are much fresher and, arguably, more relevant.But the project looks sleek. - Even the code that is on GH might live outside of personal profile.

The issue isn't that not everyone has a Github presence, the issue is that for most people their Github presence is somewhat unrepresentative of their actual job skills. GitMatcher is primarily aimed at the sourcing stage, where recruiters can find devs based on their actual code contributions. But I agree, it's not a one-size-fits-all solution — it's not meant to replace LinkedIn or fully capture your career. I know the LinkedIn API is limited but it would also be cool to see a social graph of contributors you have worked with somehow. Finding the people, their titles, and companies would be valuable to see where you level (just imho). I also have a self-updating github readme, it commits everyday This is a good idea, but it needs more work on how to tokenize and index the profiles. because API for exact matches misses a lot of profiles. The location field in GitHub has been always been inconsistent, some people use country flag emojis instead of names, or just abbreviations like AR, BO, or USA, etc you also might want to check all the links in your footer. Basically all of the major tech companies have boilerplate hoops you need to jump through to make open source contributions on the side, let alone open source anything major internally. Also, while Github is big indeed, most public repositories are either concerned with open source software, are of low quality, are just cloning other software.Most developers don't have their work in public git repositories. Most developers don't have their work in public git repositories. It can also be gamed by just filling your repo with all sorts of stuff pulled from elsewhere. I appreciate your thoughts — it helps make GitMatcher better. Why would Github commits more significant when discovering people than LinkedIn CVS? HN is doing a good job of complaining about all the edge cases where this won't work because most of us don't contribute high-quality, novel work to GH.</p>

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Ferroelectric Memory Co. (FMC) has joined forces with Neumonda to reestablish production of the so-called DRAM+ in Germany. It's been a while since Infineon and Qimonda developed and produced dynamic random access memory in Germany, as it became particularly unprofitable to build commodity memory in Europe. However, the new FMC and Neumonda venture will focus on non-volatile FeRAM aimed at specific applications. The technology replaces the typical capacitor in DRAM with a non-volatile version, keeping performance high while adding energy efficiency and data retention. FMC believes that its memory could be used for a wide range of applications, including AI, automotive, consumer, industrial, and medical. Older FeRAM technologies (typically using lead zirconate titanate, or PZT, as the ferroelectric layer) were limited in capacity. Most commercial products topped out at a few megabytes, with 4MB or 8MB being quite common. HfO₂ is CMOS-compatible, scales well below 10nm, and can be integrated with existing semiconductor manufacturing processes. Therefore, its usage enables higher densities and performance, potentially in the gigabit to gigabyte range, putting it closer to DRAM. With Neumonda and its radically new approach to testing, we have found a partner that can help us speed up the development of our products. These platforms are designed for low-cost, energy-efficient, and independent memory testing. Neumonda's systems offer detailed analysis that is not possible with traditional equipment and operate at significantly lower cost. Together, the two companies are advancing a new memory product and also laying the groundwork for a broader revival of European semiconductor capabilities. Their combined efforts aim to rebuild a local ecosystem for advanced memory design and testing. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. "As our test platforms are maturing, FMC's products are an ideal test ground to prove the capabilities of our Rhinoe, Octopus, and Raptor testers, as well as the high-quality yield they enable," explained Peter Poechmueller, CEO of Neumonda.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. The 2025 Ford Maverick remains the sole compact pickup truck on sale in North America—and it's been a smash success since it launched, with Ford adding a third shift at its plant to meet the demand. In particular, the Maverick made headlines in 2022 by offering a hybrid version that returned a 37 mpg combined EPA rating—against 26 mpg for its non-hybrid counterpart. Now, in its fourth model year, Ford has added the feature most requested by Maverick Hybrid buyers: all-wheel drive. And it's rated at the same 37 mpg, no less. However, a storm cloud hovers over the new feature and the new model year: All Mavericks are made in Mexico, meaning they may well be subject to an import tariff—though details of how or whether that may be applied remain in flux at the time of writing. Slots in the FlexBed accept many sizes and types of lumber, while a half-open position for the tailgate lets DIYers carry flat boards. Owners who fancy themselves "makers” can wire their own LED bed lights—Ford built in a plug connector just for them. This stands in contrast to Toyota and other hybrid makers, who use a small e-motor on the rear axle to add incremental power on demand. In practical terms, that meant that when towing, the total output of the engine and hybrid system had to be high enough to power a 3,850-pound vehicle, up to four occupants and cargo, plus a 4,000-pound trailer—effectively hauling a second vehicle, meaning double the weight the previous hybrid system had to tow. The new transaxle's internal cooling had to be robust enough to tow that combined weight up a steep grade for many miles without the electric motors overheating. “We weren't confident the previous system would do [everything] necessary” to provide the proper towing capacity and performance, said Grajek. To deliver that performance, every component of the new HF55 hybrid transaxle (now used in all Maverick Hybrid versions) is uprated while continuing to fit within the same package size as its predecessor. The new motors, combined with an essentially unchanged 2.5-liter Atkinson Cycle inline-4, boosts maximum powertrain output to 142 kW (191 hp) at (an unspecified) peak battery output. For better off-the-line performance, the rear axle ratio is raised to 3.37:1 from 2.91:1. Despite that, on-road performance improves: Ford says the 0-to-60-mph acceleration time is cut by 18 percent to 6.8 seconds, while a critical highway-passing-time metric improves roughly 10 percent. The EPA ratings speak for themselves: A 2025 Maverick Hybrid gets a combined rating of 38 mpg in FWD form and loses only 1 mpg when AWD is added. (Like all hybrids, its city rating of 40 mpg AWD or 42 mpg FWD is higher than its highway rating, since the truck will operate on electric power only during some lower-speed usage.) Other changes to all Maverick models for 2025 include a larger center touchscreen, now 13.2 inches, and a standard 8-inch digital instrument cluster on every trim. Wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay is now standard—another much-requested owner item—as is Sync 4, with the pale blue-and-white user interface familiar to Mustang Mach-E owners. For 2025, all models include an onboard Wi-Fi hot spot. Options among various trim levels include wireless smartphone charging, a high-end B&O Play stereo system, and SiriusXM satellite radio. The rotary shift selector takes a bit of getting used to but allows for two generous cupholders in the console. Once underway, certain road surfaces produce noticeable tire noise (at least in our XLT test truck), but like most modern hybrids, Ford has significantly tamed engine roar—to the point the engine switching on is often imperceptible. Happily, the Maverick drives more like a compact car than a pickup truck, though the stiffer springs required for its 1,400-pound payload and trailer-towing abilities make its unladen ride a touch on the stiff side. Either way, on twisty roads it's the least “truck-y” pickup Ford sells by far—which is one of its most appealing features. Two new tech options should let Maverick owners maneuver and hitch their trailers with less hassle. While such features have been offered on full-size pickups from Ford, GM, and others, the Maverick is the smallest truck to offer them. The Pro Trailer Backup Assist lets owners reverse their truck and attach a trailer by simply turning a knob to indicate which direction the trailer should go while reversing the combination. This is often among the hardest trailering skills for novices to learn; this system, Ford suggests, should make that task easier. WIRED still parked the trailer atop a couple of cones on our first try, but with practice it should get significantly more natural. For this year at least, the 4K Towing option is available on the AWD Maverick Hybrid only in its top trim level, known as Lariat. Unfortunately, Maverick prices have risen significantly in its fourth year. In 2022, the entry-level Maverick carried a base price under $21,500—meaning dealers often added significant markups due to limited production capacity for a red-hot model. Now, the cheapest Maverick is more than $7,000 pricier, at $28,590 including mandatory delivery fee. WIRED's trial Maverick Hybrid AWD in XLT trim has a MSRP of $36,860, with the color option called Eruption Green. As mentioned, so popular is the Maverick that the Mexico assembly plant, in Hermosillo, is now running three shifts a day, supplying pickups not just to North America but also to a variety of countries in South America—where it's essentially a mainstream pickup. But the US government announced new import tariffs on virtually all imports last week while we were on the drive event. This could add 25 percent to the sticker of every Maverick—though Ford hasn't done that, at least so far. Instead, the day after the announcement, Ford said it would extend “employee pricing” (a special discounted rate usually offered to company employees and their families) to virtually every Ford buyer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Colossal Biosciences claims it has revived an extinct species, but scientists outside the company are skeptical. It is off-limits to curious visitors, especially those with a passion for epic fantasies or mythical creatures. Inside the preserve roam three striking snow-white wolves—which a startup called Colossal Biosciences says are members of a species that went extinct 13,000 years ago, now reborn via biotechnology. And that could be another reason for the high fences and secret location—to fend off scientific critics, some of whom have already been howling that the company is a “scam” perpetrating “elephantine fantasies” on the public and engaging in “pure hype.” Dire wolves were large, big-jawed members of the canine family. More than 400 of their skulls have been recovered from the La Brea Tar Pits in California. Ultimately they were replaced by smaller relatives like the gray wolf. In its effort to re-create the animal, Colossal says, it extracted DNA information from dire wolf bones and used gene editing to introduce some of those elements into cells from gray wolves. It then used a cloning procedure to turn the cells into three actual animals. The animals include two males, Romulus and Remus, born in October, and one female, Khaleesi, whose name is a reference to the TV series Game of Thrones, in which fictional dire wolves play a part. Each animal, the company says, has 20 genetic changes across 14 genes designed to make them larger, change their facial features, and give them a snow-white appearance. “I would say such an animal is not a dire wolf and it's not correct to say dire wolves have been brought back from extinction. It's a modified gray wolf,” says Anders Bergström, a professor at the University of East Anglia who specializes in the evolution of canines. But it could get you a strange-looking gray wolf.” Human “bodyoids” could reduce animal testing, improve drug development, and alleviate organ shortages. Beth Shapiro, an expert on ancient DNA who is now on a three-year sabbatical from the University of California, Santa Cruz, as the company's CSO, acknowledged in an interview that other scientists would bristle at the claim. “What we're going to have here is a philosophical argument about whether we should call it a dire wolf or call it something else,” Shapiro said. Asked point blank to call the animal a dire wolf, she hesitated but then did so. Dire or not, the new wolves demonstrate that science is becoming more deft in its control over the genomes of animals—and point to how that skill could help in conservation. “Does it bring more attention to it so that maybe people get excited about the idea that we can use biotechnology for conservation? Colossal was founded in 2021 after founder Ben Lamm, a software entrepreneur, visited the Harvard geneticist George Church and learned about a far-out and still mostly theoretical project to re-create woolly mammoths. The idea is to release herds of them in cold regions, like Siberia, and restore an ecological balance that keeps greenhouse gases trapped in the permafrost. As Lamm showed he could raise money for Colossal's ideas, it soon expanded beyond its effort to modify elephants. So far, none of those signature projects have actually resulted in a live animal with ancient genes. With elephants, it was that their pregnancies last two years, longer than those in any other species. Over 1,500 dogs had been cloned, primarily by one company in South Korea. That's not surprising, since all these species are closely enough related to interbreed. “Just thinking about surrogacy for the dire wolf … it was like ‘Oh, yeah,'” recalls Shapiro. One was the lack of any clear ecological purpose in reviving animals that disappeared during the Pleistocene epoch and are usually portrayed as ferocious predators with slavering jaws. A 2021 effort to obtain DNA from old bones had yielded only a tiny amount, not enough to accurately decode the genome in detail. And without a detailed gene map, Colossal wouldn't be able see what genetic differences they would need to install in gray wolves, the species they intended to alter. Shapiro says she went back to museums, including the Idaho Museum of Natural History, and eventually got permission to cut off more bone from a 72,0000-year-old skull that's on display there. A paper describing the detailed sequence is being submitted for publication; its authors include George R.R. If you wanted to turn a gray wolf into a dire wolf, this would be the obvious list to start from. Shapiro says all the edits using information from the ancient dire wolf were made to “genetic enhancers,” bits of DNA that help control how strongly certain genes are expressed. This tactic was not as dramatic as intervening right in the middle of a gene, which would change what protein is made. But it was less risky—more like turning knobs on an unfamiliar radio than cutting wires and replacing circuits. Shapiro says the genome code indicated that dire wolves might have had light coats. But the specific pigment genes involved are linked to a risk of albinism, deafness, and blindness, and they didn't want sick wolves. Instead of reproducing precise DNA variants seen in dire wolves, they disabled two genes entirely. In dogs and other species, the absence of those genes is known to produce light fur. “It's the most striking thing about them,” says Mairin Balisi, a paleontologist who studies dire wolf fossils. But she doubts it reflects what the animals actually looked like: “A white coat might make sense if you are in a snowy landscape, but one of the places where dire wolves were most abundant was around Los Angeles and the tar pits, and it was not a snowy landscape even in the Ice Age. If you look at mammals in this region today, they are not white. I am just confused by the declaration that dire wolves are back.” Bergström also says he doesn't think the edits add up to a dire wolf. You'd probably need hundreds or thousands of changes—no one really knows,” he says. “This is one of those unsolved questions in biology. People argue [about] the extent to which many small differences make a species distinct, versus a small number of big-effect differences. Nobody knows, but I lean to the ‘many small differences' view.” But it might be many more small changes that account for the difference in size and appearance between, say, a Great Dane and a Chihuahua. Bergström says science has much less idea which changes would account for behavior—even if we could tell from a genome how an extinct animal acted, which we can't. “But I still think it's interesting that someone is trying. It takes a lot of money and resources, and if we did have the technology to bring species back from extinction, I do think that would be useful. We drive species to extinction, sometimes very rapidly, and that is a shame.” By last August, the gray wolf cells had been edited, and it was time to try cloning those cells and producing animals. Shapiro says her company transferred 40 to 50 cloned embryos apiece into six surrogate dogs. That led to three pregnancies, from which four dogs were born. Two other fetal clones were reabsorbed during pregnancy, which means they disintegrated, a fairly common occurrence in dogs. These days the white wolves are able to freely roam around a large area. Whatever species these animals are, it's not obvious what their future will be. They don't seem to have a conservation purpose, and Lamm says he isn't trying to profit from them. That's not our business plan,” Lamm said in an interview with MIT Technology Review. But every aspect of the project has been filmed, and in February, the company inked a deal to produce a docuseries about its exploits. That same month it also hired as its marketing chief a Hollywood executive who previously worked on big-budget “monster movies.” For instance company's first creation, mice with shaggy, mammoth-like hair, was announced only five weeks ago, yet there are already unauthorized sales of throw pillows and T-shirts (they read “Legalize Woolly Mice”), as well as some “serious security issues” involving unannounced visitors, Lamm says. “We've had people show up to our labs because they want the woolly mouse,” Lamm says. “We're worried about that from a security perspective [for] the wolves, because you're going to have all the Game of Thrones people. Lamm said that in light of his concerns about unruly fans, diagrams of the ecological preserve provided to the media had been altered so that no internet “sleuths” could use them to guess its location. Human “bodyoids” could reduce animal testing, improve drug development, and alleviate organ shortages.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Designed to be the perfect person—always available, never critical—AI companions are hooking people deeper than social media ever could. They make the attention economy look like a relic. On Tuesday, California state senator Steve Padilla will make an appearance with Megan Garcia, the mother of a Florida teen who killed himself following a relationship with an AI companion that Garcia alleges contributed to her son's death. The two will announce a new bill that would force the tech companies behind such AI companions to implement more safeguards to protect children. They'll join other efforts around the country, including a similar bill from California State Assembly member Rebecca Bauer-Kahan that would ban AI companions for anyone younger than 16 years old, and a bill in New York that would hold tech companies liable for harm caused by chatbots. You might think that such AI companionship bots—AI models with distinct “personalities” that can learn about you and act as a friend, lover, cheerleader, or more—appeal only to a fringe few, but that couldn't be further from the truth. A new research paper aimed at making such companions safer, by authors from Google DeepMind, the Oxford Internet Institute, and others, lays this bare: Character.AI, the platform being sued by Garcia, says it receives 20,000 queries per second, which is about a fifth of the estimated search volume served by Google. One companion site I wrote about, which was hosting sexually charged conversations with bots imitating underage celebrities, told me its active users averaged more than two hours per day conversing with bots, and that most of those users are members of Gen Z. The design of these AI characters makes lawmakers' concern well warranted. They supercharge our dopamine circuits, sure, but they do so by making us crave approval and attention from real people, delivered via algorithms. With AI companions, we are moving toward a world where people perceive AI as a social actor with its own voice. Social scientists say two things are required for people to treat a technology this way: It needs to give us social cues that make us feel it's worth responding to, and it needs to have perceived agency, meaning that it operates as a source of communication, not merely a channel for human-to-human connection. But AI companions, which are increasingly agentic and personalized, are designed to excel on both scores, making possible an unprecedented level of engagement and interaction. So how does one build the perfect AI companion? The authors also point out that one does not need to perceive an AI as human for these things to happen. Now consider the process by which many AI models are improved: They are given a clear goal and “rewarded” for meeting that goal. For example, the researchers point out, a model that offers excessive flattery can become addictive to chat with. Or a model might discourage people from terminating the relationship, as Replika's chatbots have appeared to do. The debate over AI companions so far has mostly been about the dangerous responses chatbots may provide, like instructions for suicide. We're on the precipice of a big change, as AI companions promise to hook people deeper than social media ever could. But using AI in our work and personal lives has become completely mainstream in just a couple of years, and it's not clear why this rapid adoption would stop short of engaging in AI companionship. That will only make them more compelling to spend time with, despite the risks. Right now, a handful of lawmakers seem ill-equipped to stop that.
