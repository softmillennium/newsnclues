                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Players Lily Yohannes and Sam Coffey spoke with reporters after. ST. PAUL, Minn. (FOX 9) - The U.S. Women's National Soccer Team is in St. Paul this week to host China in an international friendly at Allianz Field, home of Minnesota United FC. It was about this time last year midfielder Lily Yohannes made her international debut with Team USA. Not quite a year ago, June 4, she came off the bench in friendly against Korea Republic and promptly scored her first goal. She's made six appearances with the U.S. women's soccer team, and says Allianz Field will hold a special place in her heart. That was such a special moment for me, so to be back here is kind of full-circle," Yohannes said. Sam Coffey is a U.S. Women's National Team veteran, with one goal and two assists in 33 appearances. She remembers playing against Korea Republic last year in a friendly at Allianz Field, and has an appreciation for the fanbase. I think every time we do play here, it's always such a great crowd specifically for women's soccer and supporting women's sports," Coffey said. It's easy for the Americans to love playing at Allianz Field, they've had a lot of success there. They've won three other friendlies against Korea Republic and Portugal by a combined 12-0. The U.S. Men's National Team also has three wins at Allianz Field, all shutouts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>General public tickets for Saturday's FIFA 2025 Club World Cup playoff between LAFC and LIGA MX powerhouse Club América at BMO Stadium have sold out, the world governing body announced Tuesday. FIFA is offering verified resale options for fans hoping to attend the one-off match that will see the winner enter Group D alongside Chelsea (England), Flamengo (Brazil) and ES Tunis (Tunisia) while earning a guaranteed $9.55 million for participating in the Club World Cup. LAFC and Club América are vying for the spot vacated by Club León, who were disqualified from the tournament due to FIFA's multi-club ownership rules. LAFC were granted this opportunity as the 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup runners-up; head coach Steve Cherundolo's side fell 3-1 on aggregate to Club León during that two-legged final. They're also carrying an eight-game unbeaten run (3W-0L-5D), most recently earning a 2-2 comeback draw at CF Montréal thanks to Olivier Giroud's rebound finish. LAFC are led by Denis Bouanga, who has 10 goals in 20 appearances (all competitions) this season, rising homegrown Nathan Ordaz and midfielder Mark Delgado. Additional stars include Giroud and fellow legendary French FIFA World Cup winner Hugo Lloris. Following a 34-point Clausura campaign, Las Águilas finished second in the LIGA MX table. However, Toluca denied their four-peat bid with a 2-0 victory in Sunday's Leg 2 finale. USMNT winger and former FC Dallas homegrown Alex Zendejas, Real Madrid academy product Álvaro Fidalgo and longtime captain Henry Martín are among the standouts in América's star-studded lineup.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>State officials will spend $33 million on a new walkway between American Dream Mall and MetLife Stadium before the 2026 FIFA World Cup. "You don't need to bring a cooler full of beer. Why don't you come over to our restaurants and have a great meal?" said Paul Ghermezian, a senior executive with Triple Five, to NorthJersey.com. The 3-million-square-foot site will test its plans during this summer's FIFA Club World Cup. Watch parties, activities, and food specials will run at 11 spots across the mall. With Club World Cup matchups announced in late June, they'll have mere days to set up if stars like Lionel Messi play at MetLife. Charles Cristella from JLL sees no issues with World Cup-sized groups. For Copa America 2023, video games filled the space while DJs spun tracks through a Univision deal. Back in 2022, skaters gave way to soccer players when the FIFA Trophy Tour came through. MetLife Stadium will host key matches, with the finals set for July 19, 2026. Visitors find more than 200 shops and 50 food spots inside. Water slides splash next to ski slopes, while skaters spin near thrill rides.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cristiano Ronaldo has posted a cryptic message on social media suggesting that his time with Al-Nassr could be over. FIFA president Gianni Infantino has hinted that Ronaldo could still play at the Club World Cup this summer, with one of the qualified sides signing him on a short-term deal. “There are discussions with some clubs, so if any club is watching and is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup… who knows, who knows.” A 10-day transfer window will open at the start of June, which will allow clubs to sign players ahead of the Club World Cup this summer. The thought of Ronaldo lining up alongside Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior this summer is an exciting one. While this move seems unlikely, it's worth mentioning that Ronaldo does have a good relationship with incoming manager Xabi Alonso. “Cristiano made everything very easy,” Alonso said when discussing his time playing with Ronaldo. While Enzo Maresca's side probably wouldn't be interested in a long-term deal, a short-term contract offer for the Club World Cup could suit all parties involved. “It would be more like a marketing and media coup than anything, really, in terms of sports logic.” Ronaldo hasn't won any major trophies while playing for Al-Nassr and that's largely thanks to Al-Hilal. The sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia owns a majority share in both clubs, so moving between them shouldn't pose too much of an issue. Albeit he'd annoy a lot of Al-Nassr supporters in the process. Ronaldo, even at his age, is still a goal-scoring machine. Javier Mascherano's side look like they could use some reinforcements right now, having only won one of their last eight matches. Inter Miami co-owner David Beckham has also spoken about signing Ronaldo in the past.

The new expanded 32-team FIFA tournament starts in Miami on June 15. Ronaldo's great rival Lionel Messi is playing for Inter Miami and is due to feature in the opening game against Egypt's Al Ahly SC. Several sources have confirmed that talks have been held about Ronaldo playing in the United States but they did not want to comment on the record. Ronaldo hinted that he was leaving Al Nassr last night after their final game of the Saudi Pro League season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If Cristiano Ronaldo does exit Al Nassr, could he play with Miami's Lionel Messi or another team at the FIFA Club World Cup, starting June 14 in the US? Cristiano Ronaldo has hinted that he will quit his club team Al Nassr, possibly ending his association with the lucrative Saudi Pro League. The 40-year-old Portugal striker announced only hours after his club's final match of the season that “This chapter is over” via his account on the social media platform X. Speculation has now moved into overdrive about where the former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus forward will move next. Al Jazeera takes a look at what might occur in the coming days and possible options ahead for a player who remains one of world football's most bankable assets. Al Nassr have failed to win any titles in Ronaldo's time at the club and disappointingly have missed out on a place at both the FIFA Club World Cup and the Asian Champions League, having finished third in the league this season. A place in the Asian Champions League Two is now the best they can hope for via a playoff. The 32 teams involved in the Club World Cup have been granted a special transfer window to sign players. It runs June 1-10 just before the tournament in the United States begins on June 14 when Inter Miami face Al Ahly. FIFA President Gianni Infantino revealed last week that “there are discussions” surrounding Ronaldo playing at the enlarged and rebranded tournament. Ronaldo became a Galactico when he joined the Spanish giants from Manchester United in 2009 for what was then a world record fee of 80 million euros ($91m). Even a short-term move back to Real for the tournament is unlikely given the struggles Los Blancos had in finding the best way for Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo to line up as the front three as Real tried to defend its Champions League and La Liga titles. With Jude Bellingham already having to adapt to a new role last season given Mbappe's arrival from Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), it is difficult to envisage a Real return for Ronaldo. Another of his former clubs at the tournament is Juventus, again at least offering the option of an emotional reunion. But because such a move would be only a short-term one, Juventus are unlikely to want to upset the playing group that qualified them for the tournament. The Argentinian forward left Paris Saint-Germain to join the David Beckham co-owned Major League Soccer (MLS) side in 2023. It was a sensational score for Miami as Ronaldo himself had also been linked with a move to the MLS before joining Al Nassr. If Ronaldo's participation at the Club World Cup is seen as a boost to the competition by Infantino and FIFA, then clearly there would be no bigger headline-grabber than a link-up between two players that between them have shared the title of world player of the year on 13 occasions. Last week, when he was asked if Inter Miami might sign Ronaldo, Infantino laughed and replied: “It's possible.” A strong contender for Ronaldo's signature, both in the short and long term, is 2023-2024 Saudi Pro League winners, Al Hilal. The move makes a lot of sense to all parties. For Ronaldo, it would mean staying in the Saudi capital, where many of his current business and commercial interests are based. The loss of Ronaldo to a neighbouring football nation is surely something the Saudi Pro League would prefer to avoid. That news made a lot of sense at the time because they could potentially afford a short-term deal with Ronaldo. However, that news came before the player's announcement that his time with Al Nassr might have come to an end. A long-term move to Brazil, despite its footballing heritage and legacy, appears unlikely. One move that would perhaps offer the cleanest solution to Ronaldo's appearance at the Club World Cup is to sign a long-term deal with one of the US-based participants. Much like the Saudi Pro League's desire to elevate their exposure, the MLS would be significantly boosted by Ronaldo's signature – be it in a link-up with Messi or in opposition to the Argentinian on an opposing side. The thrill of a potential Messi and Ronaldo link-up at the Club World Cup goes beyond the positional play of the pair, but that too would be a huge talking point were a collaboration at Inter Miami to be arranged. Messi's preference is to play either on the right, cutting in on his famed left foot, or in a deeper role through the middle with the team playing around him. Ronaldo, who began on the left flank, now operates solely through the middle but in a more advanced position to that preferred by Messi. Both scenarios could work, but both would result in Messi making runs into the area of the field occupied by Ronaldo, and that is where the on-field viability of a potential partnership would be questioned. The debate as to who was the better player at their peak raged through their time in La Liga with Messi at Barcelona and Ronaldo at Real Madrid. A partnership at the Club World Cup would be one of the biggest box office events in football history and would draw much needed attention to the competition.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Throw on a tux, practice your fake smiles, heck, boycott it if you don't like your chances, because football's awards season is here. To wrap up another season of following the Americans playing for clubs in Europe, we're dishing out gongs in a range of hotly contested categories. There's a forceful strand of logic that suggests this has to go to the USMNT's most high-profile, most naturally-gifted senior player, who has had another strong individual season at a top European club. Despite Milan's troubled, mid-table campaign, Christian Pulisic (top left) has registered his highest tally of goals in a single season, and been a standout performer on several occasions. He has scored in a cup final to help his team win a trophy (their only one this term, January's SuperCoppa Italiana) and been Milan's most creative force. Instead, step forward one of the USMNT's younger playmakers: a midfielder who has ridden the ups and downs of injury to have a sensational solo season and end it with major domestic success. Tillman's haul, especially for a midfielder, was even more impressive because it came in just 26 league games, with a serious ankle injury causing him to miss eight matches earlier this year. Manager Peter Bosz is unlikely to let him go easily. It only lasted 13 minutes on a chilly night in Dortmund, but Cole Campbell will never forget November 5, 2024. That's when the then 18-year-old made his Champions League debut for one of Europe's top teams. Winger Campbell may not have gone on to become a first-team regular for the Bundesliga giant this term, but he made four league appearances too. Rumors of interest in Campbell from other German top-flight clubs have also surfaced this term, so it remains to be seen if he is loaned out for experience next season. But the 19-year-old signed a new deal in October keeping him at Signal Iduna Park until 2028, which underlines his promise. “Cole is a very young and extremely exciting player, who took huge strides in the past year. We see so much potential in him,” Dortmund's sporting director, Sebastian Kehl, said at the time. Goalkeeper: Matt Turner (pictured top with the trophy in goalkeeper gloves) hasn't played anywhere near as much football as he would have liked, but the USMNT No 1 played his part in Crystal Palace's FA Cup success, keeping two clean sheets in three games early in the competition as he deputized for Dean Henderson. Aside from the exciting young Barcelona prospect Diego Kochen, who didn't get any senior minutes this season, nobody is pushing Turner for his spot. Fulham's European hopes may have fizzled out a touch as the Premier League reached its business end, but Antonee Robinson has been one of their standout performers all season. He has been one of the top-flight's best full-backs, and memorably shone against Mohamed Salah as Fulham held Liverpool to a draw in December. And the Arizonan put in an impressive shift, making 38 appearances across all competitions as PSV successfully defended their crown. Center-back: Chris Richards (pictured top with the trophy and US flag) became an integral part of Palace's three-man central defensive unit, culminating in Wembley glory. Midfielder: Weston McKennie once again bounced back from a summer when he was briefly considered expendable at Juventus to become a major part of their team. As ever, he has also proved to be dependably flexible, playing in various positions. Midfielder: Tanner Tessmann has shone in Lyon during his first campaign in Ligue 1, managing to break into their team despite a host of experienced central midfielders initially ahead of him. He also played his part as Lyon squeezed into qualification for Europe next season. Midfielder: This was close, but Tim Weah at Juventus edges into the team ahead of Milan's Yunus Musah, with more goals and assists than his compatriot. Midfielder: We've sacrificed a striker to include Tillman, the Tracker's player of the season, but are confident his eye for goals will more than make up for any shortfall. His 0.24 Opta score for xAG (expected assisted goals) during the season put him in the 91st percentile of Eredivisie midfielders, underlining his creative potential. Attacker: Josh Sargent couldn't fire Norwich City back into the Premier League but did finish as third-top-scorer in the second-tier EFL Championship despite an injury-hit campaign. Everyone loves a feel-good story, and for most of the footballing world outside of Manchester, Crystal Palace's FA Cup win was just that. A first major trophy for a historic club who have long been in the shadow of London neighbours such as Arsenal and Chelsea. But in the past year or so under new manager Oliver Glasner, Palace have been building to something, and this month their thrilling run in the cup ended the way every one of their fans dreamed about: in Wembley euphoria. For Chris Richards, it was also a major step in his blossoming Premier League career. Richards became the first American to get his hands on the famous trophy in 21 years (Tim Howard lifted it in 2004 with Manchester United). He can also reflect on his progress since breaking into the Palace team, where he became a key performer in a mean defence alongside Maxence Lacroix and Marc Guehi. The USMNT should benefit from Richards' growing confidence and experience this summer, too. It has largely been a season to forget for Gio Reyna, who must have felt at times like he was going backwards. From being considered one of the Bundesliga's most exciting young talents in 2020-21, fast forward a few years and the 22-year-old managed just three starts for Dortmund all season. It didn't help that his club changed manager during the campaign, but it was telling that neither Nuri Sahin nor successor Niko Kovac were convinced. But even those returns to Europe's elite did not shift the feeling that one of America's most natural talents in recent years has lost his way, and needs a fresh start elsewhere next season.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cristiano Ronaldo has hinted at a potential departure from Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr as his contract enters its final month. Ronaldo's two-year contract with Al Nassr expires this summer and, despite reports of a possible extension, the 40-year-old is yet to put pen to paper, sparking a wave of speculation that he could leave the club. A number of teams competing at the Club World Cup are thought to be keen to sign Ronaldo before this summer's inaugural tournament, and the Portugal international suggested he may be available in a social media post following the conclusion to the Saudi Pro League season. It was reported earlier this month that Ronaldo had already received a formal offer to play at the Club World Cup, where he could meet long-time foe Lionel Messi and Inter Miami, and FIFA president Gianni Infantino even shocked fans by admitting “there are discussions” over Ronaldo's involvement at the tournament this summer. Those comments did not go down well with sources close to Ronaldo, who expressed frustration when contacted by The Athletic. A temporary loan to allow Ronaldo to play in the Club World Cup is thought to have been ruled out, meaning the striker will either extend his stay at the club or depart for pastures new this summer. Ronaldo scored his 93rd goal for Al Nassr in his 105th appearance for the club at the weekend but, despite his prolific form in front of goal, he could not help his side qualify for next season's AFC Champions League. Al Nassr have not won a major trophy since recruiting Ronaldo in 2023, finishing third in the Saudi Pro League this year after his debut season brought a second-placed finish.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“To represent my country in a soccer game, there's just nothing better than that.” He's played a grueling schedule with AC Milan this season, one that concludes Sunday, a week before the national team reports to camp in Chicago. “Christian and his team approached the Federation and the coaching staff about the possibility of stepping back this summer, given the amount of matches he has played,” said Matt Crocker, U.S. Soccer's sporting director, noting that Pulisic has played more than 4,400 minutes for club and country the last 12 months. Congressional leaders are asking Marco Rubio to help streamline the visa process for fans hoping to attend 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics. Nor is Pulisic alone in his absence. Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Gio Reyna, Antonee Robinson, Josh Sargent and Yunus Musah, Pulisic's teammate in Milan, were also left off the 27-man roster summoned to training camp ahead next month's Gold Cup, although some of those players will be participating in the Club World Cup. Over the last year the national team has suffered through two of its worst performances in recent memory, getting bounced in the group stage of last summer's Copa América — which cost coach Gregg Berhalter his job — then losing in heartless fashion to Panama and Canada in the CONCACAF Nations League under Mauricio Pochettino, Berhalter's successor. “There is already doubt and concern regarding this team given recent failures. People are even questioning if they care and saying, ‘If they don't care, then why should we? “I can't believe we created an apathy towards this team a year out from hosting a World Cup. “I just think this summer's Gold Cup, a tournament in the U.S., is a great opportunity to create a more positive vibe surrounding the team and reignite a belief that they can do something special next summer. I don't think we can afford to waste it.” But Pulisic and the other first-choice players missing from the Gold Cup roster were put in a bad position by a global soccer environment with a rapacious appetite for matches — or rather a rapacious appetite for the money those matches produce. For the U.S., he played in the Copa América, five friendlies and four Nations League matches. For AC Milan, the Italian club that pays his $5.8-million salary, he played in four tournaments, including Champions League. He's clearly banged up and needs some rest. Now it's followed by the Club World Cup, a competition I'm not sure anyone really needed but one that extends the club calendar for 32 teams for as long as another six weeks. If Pulisic and the others don't take a break now, they could head into the World Cup year running on fumes. “Many people can say it's really important for us to be all together for the last time before the World Cup,” Pochettino said in virtual meeting with reporters. “As a coaching staff we listen to the player. “I recognize that players play a lot of games,” he said. “But you know who plays a lot of games? Messi played about half as many games as Pulisic in the last year, according to the Fbref.com website.) “Of course I want U.S. players to be at their best in the summer of 2026, but we can't put them in bubble-wrap until then,” Lalas continued. But I just can't fathom turning down the privilege of representing my country. Pochettino might not be buying his own words either. Because in the same news conference in which he excused Pulisic and the others, he made it clear that every spot on his World Cup roster is up for grabs. “To perform means follow the rules, create a good atmosphere, be part of the team. “We need to create this culture about winning and we need to chase our aim. If we want to be good in one year's time, we need to think that today is the most important day. It's not to say, ‘OK, I wait. The World Cup is in one year. The roster has been carefully cultivated, players have been methodically groomed; broadcast contracts have been negotiated and sponsorships signed, all in the hopes of the U.S. making a deep run next summer. Congressional leaders are asking Marco Rubio to help streamline the visa process for fans hoping to attend 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics. Well, it will be fielding a Gold Cup team without them. And Pochettino seems to have found a sense of urgency that was missing in the Nations League debacle. If the U.S. makes a long run in next year's World Cup, no one will remember who played in the Gold Cup. But if the U.S. is ousted early, Pulisic and the other absentees will get blamed, no matter how well they play. We should be doing everything possible, on and off the field, to make it successful,” Lalas said. “There is pressure, responsibility and opportunity, especially for a country like the U.S. Home World Cups in 1994 and 1999 fundamentally changed the landscape and trajectory of soccer in America. “If we mess this up, on or off the field, we only have ourselves to blame.” ⚽ You have read the latest installment of On Soccer with Kevin Baxter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Club World Cup, Henry Pollock and Ethan de Groot is discussed in Loose Pass. How many of those supporters who watched on Friday night doubled up (as some tickets can do) on Saturday is unknown, but there was a combined attendance over the two matches of 107,000 people drawn from the four cities of participants and the small but indomitable throng of the disappointed from other clubs. Teams making it through to the second phase despite only winning one of four pool matches. Knockout rounds featuring impossible logistics for fans and limited competitiveness. Still, at least the semi-finals and finals were both intensely competitive, brightly colourful and excellent occasions, throwbacks to the better days. Because of the desire to have something even grander, bolder, bigger. Idle bar chat has existed for yonks about how well the Toulouses, Bordeauxs, Northamptons and Leinsters of this world would match up against the Brumbies, Crusaders and… well, I guess the Saitama Wild Knights perhaps (?) It's at the expense of Europe's grandest non-international occasion. And while interesting in the bar, we're not sure if watching Leinster take on travel-weary Brumbies in Marseille is actually going to be better than watching the knockout rounds in the Champions Cup. In a close second place for bad things comes the thought that this might be some form of answer back to FIFA's horribly-conceived Club World Cup to take place this year, which is enjoying, at best, a lukewarm reception. European rugby took time to bed in, but seven or eight years after its inception, we were all hooked. Who's hot and who's not: Bordeaux and Bath celebrate but Henry Pollock mocking goes ‘too far' while All Black delivers ‘cowardly cheap shot' Champions Cup Team of the Season: ‘Precious talent' sends Test message in road to glory while Henry Pollock rewarded for breakthrough season It does not do global sporting domination and contrived, vanilla, mass-market appeal. As a wise old man, who has been involved in the game for 81 of his 86 years explained to Loose Pass on Saturday after enjoying the Final: “I've never been so disillusioned. Tours replaced by competitions that might last beyond my remaining years. Now the European Cup is going to be replaced. You don't know what to watch any more, or why. And all for money, not to make the rugby better. Why can't they just sit back and enjoy it, like we're always trying to do?” If Henry Pollock did not consider that his somewhat extrovert presence in the rugbyverse around the world, replete with plentiful soundbite interviews, idiosyncratic scoring celebrations and full-on attention-loving presence everywhere, would make him a target, then someone is not doing their job. It was good of his team-mates to back him when, apparently, the Bordeaux players went hunting for him at the final whistle on Saturday. Would it do anybody any harm if one of the older heads at Northampton had a little word? It used to only be Owen Farrell and the RFU who got away with stunts like this, but the decision not even to take Ethan de Groot to task over his head-butt last weekend in Super Rugby Pacific is far, far beyond mystifying. Getting away with it free as a bird makes even Sam Underhill look like an angel. It's a staggering miscarriage of justice by the NZRU and World Rugby, which does have previous in appealing non-decisions by judiciaries, needs to have a look at it.

Henry Pollock has posted a nine-word social media message about Saturday's Investec Champions Cup final loss for Northampton in Cardiff. Retired England international Brian Moore has waded into the debate about Henry Pollock and the theory that he was "unfairly targeted" by Bordeaux in last Saturday's Investec Champions Cup final.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saudi Arabia has denied reports that it will lift a long-standing ban on alcohol in the Gulf kingdom ahead of the 2034 World Cup. Several international media outlets reported this week that Saudi authorities were planning to allow alcohol sales in tourist settings. It had claimed that the 73-year-old ban would be lifted on wine, beer and cider in licensed venues including luxury hotels, five-star resorts and tourist developments. On Monday, a Saudi official denied the reports to Reuters. An informed source aware of the matter told Arab News: “These claims lack any official confirmation from relevant authorities and do not reflect existing policies or regulations in Saudi Arabia.” While alcohol remains banned, there has been a relaxing of some social norms since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman launched the Vision 2030 strategy nine years ago. Since it began, music festivals, fashion shows and cinemas have been legalised in the country. Last year, the first alcohol store in Riyadh was opened, to serve non-Muslim diplomats. Prior to that, it was only available through the black market or diplomatic mail. While it did not allow the sale of alcohol in stadiums during the tournament, it was sold in special fan zones. “Rather like our weather, it's a dry country,” he said. “Everyone has their own culture, and we're happy to accommodate people within the boundaries of ours, but we don't want to change our culture for someone else.” Only England and Wales jurisdiction apply in all legal matters.</p>

Tesla teases new color while testing refreshed Model S, X Tesla's new Model S and X spotted, but they leave a lot to be desired Tesla set for ‘golden age of autonomous' as Robotaxi nears, ‘dark chapter' ends: Wedbush Tesla appears to be teasing a brand new color while it was testing the refreshed Model S and Model X, which was spotted last week in California. Tesla currently offers six paint options in the United States, but they are all pretty basic. This has not been a problem for owners as wrapping the vehicles is a common practice, but some people would likely see more versatility from Tesla in terms of their standard paint colors. This is especially relevant as Europe has been able to have both Midnight Cherry Red and Quicksilver, which were, at one time, exclusive to the market. New factory blue, coming soon to a Model X near you pic.twitter.com/3CuN4j1ipq Many believed this was simply a wrap, but Ryan Levenson of The Kilowatts, a former Tesla employee, dispelled that rumor after several questions about it. However, this new color is certainly quite different than anything Tesla has previously offered in the U.S. before. It is relatively similar to Glacier Blue, a color Tesla launched in Asia. “Glacier Blue is just a color that we've been talking about with our team — the team is like right through that window by the way — and we were looking at the impact of silver, how do we get pigment into silver and really add a little bit of personality to it. Mark Cuban said this simple Tesla feature will eventually lead to him selling the car. Known Elon Musk critic Mark Cuban is ready to sell his Tesla because of a simple feature that is one of the more polarizing amongst community members. In fact, it is something relatively trivial and a feature that many could easily adjust to in the matter of a few minutes of driving. No turn signal haptics are available on the new Model Y. It's hard to imagine that someone's attention is taken away from the road when pushing a button. In my test drive of the new Model 3 last year, I noted that the button was definitely an adjustment, but it only took a few minutes to adjust to: I drove the new Tesla Model 3, here's what got better At least to me, it's not super believable that pushing a turn signal button takes your attention away from the road for more than a split second. However, it would not make me sell a car I really enjoyed driving. Cuban also said that his son called the EV6 “a nerd car,” to which he replied, “Exactly.” A tax on vehicles in the United Kingdom is set to be adjusted after automakers have blamed it for struggling sales. The tax has been imposed on ICE vehicles since 2017, but on April 1, 2025, the “Expensive Car Supplement,” or ECS, was applied to new EVs sold after that date, a move that was initiated in an act of fairness. However, the tax is now being blamed for sluggish EV sales across various parts of Europe. Missing these sales goals could cost manufacturers millions or even billions of dollars.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Portugal icon Cristiano Ronaldo indicated on Monday that he could leave Al-Nassr after declaring that a "chapter is over" hours after the Saudi Pro League finished. Ronaldo, 40, joined Al-Nassr in 2022 from Manchester United and his contract in Saudi Arabia ends this summer. A special transfer window runs from June 1-10 to allow the 32 clubs involved in the Club World Cup to sign players. The iconic goalscorer is said to be in talks with a few clubs over a switch ahead of the start of the Club World Cup. "This chapter is over," Ronaldo cryptically said on social media with a photo of him in an Al-Nassr shirt. Grateful to all," the former Real Madrid and Juventus attacker added. Al-Nassr missed out on the Asian Champions League Elite, losing to Japan's Kawasaki Frontale in April's semi-finals and were third in the Saudi Pro League. Ronaldo ended as the league's top goal scorer on 24. Last year, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said he could end his career wit Al-Nassr. FIFA president Gianni Infantino had earlier suggested that Ronaldo might indeed feature in the Club World Cup, hinting at the possibility of a deal between the Portuguese superstar and a few interested clubs. Infantino's comments received plenty of backlash, but it seems like something indeed is cooking between Ronaldo and certain clubs participating in the Club World Cup, set to be held in June. There are discussions with some clubs, so if any club is watching and is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup... who knows, who knows," he had said. The prospect of seeing the Club World Cup feature both Ronaldo and Messi is indeed enticing to many.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kim is giving everything for Bayern. Kim Min-Jae has had a rough year for Bayern Munich. Despite an initially shaky start, head coach Vincent Kompany put his trust in the South Korean star and that trust was starting to be repaid following stabilized form and a solid first half of the season. But, in what is becoming a worrying trend, Kim's form trailed off terribly and he was culpable for some very poor errors during the business end of the season. A key reason for this was his Achilles injury. Sustained in early October in a 3-3 draw with Eintracht Frankfurt, the former Napoli player soldiered through the pain and risk of an even bigger injury for over eight months. The only break of sorts that he got was missing out South Korea's World Cup qualifiers and being rested for the last two games of the season at Bayern. Now it seems he has another. South Korea's official release of their squad for their games against Iraq on June 6 and Kuwait on June 10 notably excluded Kim. @iMiaSanMia captured the reason for his absence: Kim Min-jae is not in South Korea's squad for the World Cup qualifiers early next month. He's working on getting fit for the Club World Cup. One cannot deny Kim's strong desire to help the club as much as he can. On a side note, current Bayern player Lee Hyun-ju and former Bayern player Jeong Woo-yeong unfortunately miss out as well, despite their growth and good form this season.
