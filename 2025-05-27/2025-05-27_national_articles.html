                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>National Public Radio and three local stations are suing President Donald Trump, arguing that an executive order aimed at cutting federal funding for the organization is illegal. The headquarters for National Public Radio (NPR) is seen in Washington, April 15, 2013. NEW YORK (AP) — National Public Radio and three of its local stations sued President Donald Trump on Tuesday, arguing that his executive order cutting funding to the 246-station network violates their free speech and relies on an authority that he does not have. Earlier this month, Trump instructed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal agencies to cease funding for NPR and PBS, either directly or indirectly. The president and his supporters argue their news reporting promotes liberal bias and shouldn't be supported by taxpayers. Retaliation is Trump's plain purpose, the lawsuit argues. It was filed in federal court in Washington by NPR and three Colorado entities — Colorado Public Radio, Aspen Public Radio and KUTE, Inc., chosen to show the system's diversity in urban and rural areas. “By basing its directives on the substance of NPR's programming, the executive order seeks to force NPR to adapt its journalistic standards and editorial choices to the preferences of the government if it is to continue to receive federal funding,” Katherine Maher, NPR's CEO, said Tuesday. The lawsuit alleges that Trump is acting to contravene the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a private nonprofit corporation set up to distribute federal funding to NPR and PBS, which is intended to insulate the system from political interference. Congress has appropriated $535 million yearly to CPB for 2025, 2026 and 2027. In response to the lawsuit, White House deputy press secretary Harrison Fields said that CPB “is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime,” so Trump was exercising his authority under the law. “The president was elected with a mandate to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and he will continue to use his lawful authority to achieve that objective,” Fields said. Trump hasn't hidden his feelings about NPR, calling it a “liberal disinformation machine” in an April social media post. The court fight seemed preordained, given that the heads of NPR and PBS both reacted to Trump's move earlier this month with statements that they believed it was illegal. The absence of PBS from Tuesday's filing indicates the two systems will challenge this separately; PBS has not yet gone to court, but is likely to soon. The president's attempts to dismantle government-run news sources like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty have also sparked court fights. The Federal Communications Commission is investigating ABC, CBS and NBC News. That station was founded in 1976 by the Southern Ute Indian Tribe. NPR notes that the order attempts to prohibit individual stations in NPR's system from using any federal money to buy NPR programming, like “All Things Considered,” the most listened-to afternoon radio news program in the country, its early counterpart “Morning Edition” and cultural programming like the Tiny Desk concerts. The order “directly interferes with editorial independence by requiring them to seek programming elsewhere,” the lawsuit said. NPR says it also provides infrastructure services to hundreds of public radio stations and without it, their coverage area would shrink. “Public broadcasting is an irreplaceable foundation of American civic life,” Maher said.</p>

As summer approaches and many Americans plan to jet-set across the country and world on vacation, the U.S. Department of State is warning travelers to take caution while visiting a popular destination. The advisory warns that terrorists "may attack with little or no warning" and encourages Americans to be aware of common targets, including tourist spots, transportation centers, shopping malls and markets, local government buildings, hotels, clubs, restaurants, religious sites, parks, sports and cultural events, schools, airports and public areas. The State Department has issued a Level 2 travel warning for Italy, urging travelers to exercise increased caution due to the risk of terrorism. The travel advisory also emphasized the importance of "staying alert in tourist spots" and "to check local media for breaking news." "Be prepared to adjust your plans and prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations," the advisory read. The department is also encouraging travelers to enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive messages and alerts from the U.S. Embassy, stating it "makes it easier to locate you in an emergency." People admire the 18th-century Trevi Fountain, one of Rome's most iconic landmarks, as it reopens to the public after undergoing maintenance, Dec. 22, 2024. The warning comes as concerns over potential attacks in popular tourist destinations and public areas heighten in Italy, which remains one of the top European destinations for American tourists. In May, the State Department issued travel advisories for 21 countries worldwide, ranging from the lowest level 1, which alerts travelers to "Exercise Normal Precautions," to the highest advisory at level 4, which means "Do Not Travel." Italy has been under a level 2 advisory since April 2022, according to the State Department. Crowds gather for a view of the Trevi Fountain in Rome on June 3, 2022. The State Department said they review travel advisories on a regular basis and would update alerts "any time conditions change substantially." Level 1 and 2 advisories are reviewed every 12 months, while levels 3 and 4 are reviewed at least every six months, the department added. A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital that there is "no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas." "We take seriously our commitment to provide U.S. citizens with clear, timely, and reliable information about every country in the world so they can make informed travel decisions," a State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital. "The Department of State routinely updates our Travel Advisories and destination information pages based on a comprehensive review of all available safety information and ongoing developments." Italy's political system is also traditionally volatile, and, as of 2018, saw a populist coalition rise to power. She covers topics including missing persons, homicides, national crime cases, illegal immigration, and more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You'll never guess which institutions are polling lower than almost any other right now. Per Gallup's latest polling asking which institution voters trust most, small businesses rank highest at 65%, with the military and police coming in second and third, respectively. And per separate polling from Quinnipiac, the Democratic Party is clocking in at 21% approval. Yes, this was a dominant story that lasted several years during President Donald Trump's first term. “Do you still believe the president could be a Russian asset?” Anderson Cooper asked during an interview with disgraced former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on CNN. I think that's why we started our investigation, and I'm really anxious to see where Mueller concludes that,” McCabe, who was fired from the FBI for leaking sensitive information to the press, replied without a hint of self-awareness. In March 2017, she feared that Russia had not just stolen the election but also the U.S. government: “We are also starting to see what may be signs of continuing influence in our country. “Breaking news: ABC News's Brian Ross is reporting Michael Flynn promised full cooperation to the Mueller team and is prepared to testify that as a candidate, Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians!” Joy Behar exclaimed on ABC's The View. And even after the Robert Mueller report exonerated Trump, many of these outlets pushed the “Trump is owned by the Russians” narrative to this very day as he attempted to broker a peace between Ukraine and Russia. May 11, 2020: Trump touts increased testing for COVID, which essentially shut down the country two months prior. But CBS reporter Weijia Jiang decided to be hostile in her line of questioning. “Why is this a global competition to you if every day, Americans are still losing their lives, and we're still seeing more cases every day?” “Well, they're losing their lives everywhere in the world. And maybe that's a question you should ask China,” Trump responded. “Sir, why are you saying that to me specifically?” an offended Jiang shot back. “I'm not saying it specifically to anybody,” Trump calmly replied before moving on. Washington Post: “Trump's ‘ask China' response to CBS's Weijia Jiang shocked the room — and was part of a pattern.” Vogue: “'Go Ask China': Trump's Latest Attack on a Female Reporter Sparks Outrage.” BLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors, however, allocated $1.6 million to her father for “security services,” while $2.1 million went to BLM board member Shalomyah Bowers for “consulting.” And per NPR in April 2022, $6 million was spent on a luxury home in California for BLM's top brass. So, after being heralded by professional sports leagues and legacy media, BLM has since seen its donations dry up and its relevance shattered. Even Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington, D.C., was recently dismantled. “Hunter Biden story is Russian disinfo, dozens of former intel officials say.” That was the headline of a Politico story in October 2020 touting that “more than 50 former intelligence officials signed a letter casting doubt on the provenance of a New York Post story on the former vice president's son.” It turns out the New York Post story was 100% correct. Hunter Biden's laptop detailed shady business dealings overseas through influence peddling. He made close to $1 million as a board member of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma without having any experience in the energy sector. Compensation from companies in China was also funneled through shell companies to various members of the Biden family, with emails citing “the big guy” receiving a 10% cut. “Start your tape right now because I'm about to tell you the truth. The host made this comment despite seeing then-President Joe Biden repeatedly forget the names of his Cabinet members, call only on handpicked reporters during rare press conferences, wander off during photo shoots, fall up the stairs on Air Force One, claim to have conversations with dead people, and spend long weekends at his homes in Delaware. “So, I said that this was Biden at his best. Scarborough wasn't alone in his laughable assessment at the time. CNN's Jake Tapper lambasted Lara Trump in an interview when she accurately observed that Biden was experiencing a cognitive decline. The “anchor” simply blamed a “stutter” for Biden's lapses. Tapper, because he has a book to sell, is now looking back on his coverage with “humility.” In 2024, before Biden dropped out of the presidential race, the White House blamed “cheap fake” videos produced by conservatives for Biden's decline. The media, showing there is no bottom, echoed this sentiment. Washington Post: “How Republicans used misleading videos to attack Biden in a 24-hour period.” NBC News: “Misleading GOP videos of Biden are going viral. It's beyond parody to look at these comments and headlines. After looking at these examples, the only answer to this question is, “Not on your life.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding from California on Tuesday after a transgender athlete competed in the female track and field state qualifiers. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) on Tuesday and mentioned that the California governor recently said allowing biological males to compete in female sports was “unfair.” In a Truth Social post, Trump said it was “totally demeaning to women and girls” that officials allowed the 16-year-old transgender athlete to compete in the state track event. “California, under the leadership of Radical Left Democrat Gavin Newscum, continues to ILLEGALLY allow ‘MEN TO PLAY IN WOMEN'S SPORTS,” Trump posted. “This week a transitioned Male athlete, at a major event, won ‘everything,' and is now qualified to compete in the ‘State Finals' next weekend. As a Female, this transitioned person is practically unbeatable.” “The Governor, himself, said it is ‘UNFAIR,'” Trump posted. His administration has been enforcing Title IX civil rights protections on the basis of biological sex, as opposed to gender identity. The government is interpreting policies that require females to compete against transgender athletes, instead of having female-exclusive sports, as Title IX violations. The government has withheld funding from Maine and frozen millions of dollars in funding from the University of Pennsylvania due to similar practices.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Forget marching in the streets with creative signs. For President Donald Trump's second term, in the face of steep funding cuts for climate and weather research and forecasting, scientists have a new way of engaging the public: livestreamed presentations. ET and lasting for 100 straight hours, climate and weather specialists will spend 15 minutes each talking about their work and why it is so valuable for the American people. Their goal is to call attention to the impacts of cuts to federal agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NASA and the Department of Energy, along with the Trump administration's withholding of research funding to academia. The livestream marathon is billed as nonpartisan, according to Marc Alessi of the environmental group Union of Concerned Scientists, who is one of about a dozen organizers. It is also timed to mark the end of NASA's longstanding lease at Columbia University, which housed the agency's top climate lab, known as the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The Trump administration canceled that lease in April, and the facility's scientists, who study Earth's climate and track global average temperatures, will be forced to work remotely. “We think that this livestream is basically an opportunity for scientists to show how these cuts to our research really damage our ability to do climate science and weather prediction,” Alessi said. “If the American public tunes in, they watch our science talks, they will see how our science benefits the public,” he said. Climate scientist Kate Marvel, who will be participating in the livestream event in her personal capacity, said the series of talks may be “The scientist-iest thing we could do,” but it makes sense given the expertise of those who are taking part. “This is really speaking to the public and saying, ‘Look, look at all of the amazing stuff you get for pennies on the dollar,'” she said, referring to publicly-funded weather and climate research. “Nobody wants to hear me complain about the administration,” Marvel said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• The latest: Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs, is testifying in his criminal sex-trafficking trial. Ventura testified earlier in the trial that she endured physical and sexual abuse from Combs and detailed how he orchestrated drug-fueled sex performances called “Freak Offs.” If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. • Editor's Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence, there are resources available, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs, is back on the stand following a lunch break, and the jury is returning. Lawyers are discussing upcoming exhibits before the jury is brought in. Prosecutors said that they are so far ahead of schedule, their case is likely shaping up to last five weeks instead of the six weeks they originally estimated. The jury has been dismissed for a lunch break until 1:15 p.m. “We hung out all the time, I played it super cool,” she said. I just knew for sure that you liked to have me around.” Capricorn Clark, a former employee for Sean “Diddy” Combs, testified that she met Combs around 2002 through a mutual friend shortly after she moved to New York City. Clark said Combs took ecstasy in the early stages of their friendship, and his drug use increased over time. Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo began by confirming with Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs, that they had met before. Agnifilo, Teny Geragos, and another attorney for Sean Combs, Jonathan Davis, met with Clark, who brought an attorney and a friend with her on April 10, 2024. Agnifilo asked Clark to confirm that she told the lawyers at the meeting that Combs “wouldn't be in this mess if he had kept (her) around.” She acknowledged she probably said something like that as they discussed the possibility of her returning to work for him as his chief of staff. Returning to that meeting in April 2024, Agnifilo suggested that she was told it would be impossible to hire her amid the ongoing criminal investigation into Combs. Since Sean “Diddy” Combs federal criminal trial began earlier this month, three of the music mogul's former assistants have been called to testify about their experience working for him, with patterns starting to emerge. On the stand today is Capricorn Clark, a former personal assistant to Combs and former marketing executive for his clothing brand Sean Jean. So far, Clark testified that she was subjected to taking a lie detector test, threats and intimidation, and witnessed Combs be violent with Cassie Ventura. She also described an encounter where she saw Combs enter rapper Kid Cudi's home after he found out about his relationship with Ventura, an incident that Kid Cudi testified about last week. Clark is the third former Combs assistant to testify, joining David James and George Kaplan. James was an assistant for Combs from 2007 to 2009 and worked for Combs during the early part of his relationship with Ventura. James described witnessing Combs use drugs and testified about his role in stocking hotel rooms for him when he traveled. He also testified about being subjected to lie detector tests and intimidation. Kaplan also said part of his job as Combs' assistant was to clean up the hotel rooms Combs stayed in and, at one point, he said he picked up drugs for him. Another high-ranking executive on Combs' team, Kristina Khorram, Combs' former chief of staff, has been mentioned several times during testimony throughout the trial, but there is no indication yet whether she will be called to testify. Remember: Combs is facing charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. The government alleges that between 2004 and 2024, Combs created a criminal enterprise using his business empire where he engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice. Jurors in the Sean “Diddy” Combs' federal racketeering and sex-trafficking trial have heard from 17 witnesses so far. Capricorn Clark, former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs and Cassie Ventura: Sean “Diddy” Combs' mother and sister are inside the courtroom today. After court recessed for a short break, Combs' mother kissed defense lawyer Nicole Westmoreland on the cheek. Combs' sister Keisha, who has been a constant presence at the trial, is also present today. Combs' mother was overheard saying she attended her granddaughters' graduation and prom. During Capricorn Clark's emotional testimony, she often patted her eyes with a tissue. Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo will begin cross-examination after court takes a short break. Capricorn Clark, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former employee, testified that she retained attorneys in 2023 after Cassie Ventura filed her lawsuit against Combs. Clark met with attorneys for Combs in April 2024, and they spoke about the possibility of her working for one of Combs' companies again. Clark testified that she hasn't spoken to Ventura since 2018. The prosecution needs to show a pattern of “criminal activity” by Sean “Diddy” Combs and his associates to reinforce the racketeering conspiracy charge, CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson said. “We're talking about the prosecution saying it was a criminal racketeering enterprise, a conspiracy, and so in order to do that you have to get people in your inner circle –– as we see the assistants who have testified so far –– that would establish that over a period of time there was illegal things happening in this business. That he was agreeing with his confederates who were acting as, really, as underbosses, to carry out his lawless activities,” Jackson told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Though she was fired in 2012, Capricorn Clark returned to work for Sean “Diddy” Combs as Cassie Ventura's creative director in 2016, Clark testified. Clark testified she noticed an increase in Ventura's drug use during this time. Clark testified that she received a settlement through Combs' attorneys over wrongful termination allegations in the fall of 2012. After the December 2011 incident, Sean “Diddy” Combs told Capricorn Clark she couldn't be friends with Cassie Ventura; they could only see each other for work. Clark also said that in early 2012, she informed someone in human resources and Harve Pierre, the former president of Bad Boy Records, about the kidnapping incident and how Combs wanted to kill Kid Cudi and beat Ventura. Pierre just told her, “That's crazy, but it's going to be OK.” After the events of late 2011, Sean “Diddy” Combs would angrily ask Capricorn Clark why she didn't tell him about Cassie Ventura's brief relationship with Kid Cudi, Clark testified. Clark estimated Combs threatened her about 50 times between December 2011 and the following summer. Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs, said arson investigators reached out to her in 2012, asking her to make a statement about an arson incident involving Kid Cudi's vehicle. Clark said she hung up the phone and did not provide a statement. “I wanted this whole thing to be over,” she testified. Clark added that she never discussed an arson incident involving Cudi with Combs. Looking at photos, Cudi explained that it looked “like the top of my Porsche was cut open, and that's where the Molotov cocktail was put in,” causing further damage that couldn't be salvaged, Capricorn Clark said that after Sean “Diddy” Combs allegedly broke into Kid Cudi's home, she approached Cassie Ventura, who was still with Kid Cudi. Clark told them, “If you tell on him, he's going to hurt us all.” According to Clark, Ventura responded by asking her, “Do you really think he will?” Clark said she and a security guard stood by as Combs repeatedly kicked Ventura. Clark said she left after the security guard told her to leave, and Ventura was still on the ground while Combs continued to kick her. I can't call the police but you can,” Clark recalled telling Ventura's mother. Former Sean “Diddy” Combs employee Capricorn Clark is now testifying about what happened directly after the episode in which she says Combs and a security guard were at Kid Cudi's home in December 2011. Clark, Combs, and his security guard went to a nearby nightclub, she said. Combs directed Clark to call Cassie Ventura and tell her that “he has me, and he's not going to let me go until I come get her,” Clark testified Combs then said she and Ventura needed to convince Kid Cudi to not tell police that Combs was involved in the break-in at Kid Cudi's home, Clark testified. Clark testified she told Ventura, “Cassie, stop him, he's going to come get himself killed.” Ventura said she couldn't stop him. Clark testified she understood Kid Cudi was on his way to the house. When Combs got back in the car, he asked who Clark had been talking to. He called Ventura's burner phone, which was the last record in Clark's call log. Combs, furious, said, “B*tch what the f**k is this number.” A short time later, Kid Cudi pulled up next to Combs' Escalade outside his home and then accelerated away. “It felt like forever, but couldn't have been longer than a minute,” Clark testified about the pursuit. Capricorn Clark is giving more details about what happened after Sean “Diddy” Combs' showed up at her home in December 2011. Clark said she stayed in the car and called Cassie Ventura — Combs' former girlfriend who was dating Kid Cudi at the time — on a burner phone. Clark said she could hear someone yelling, “He's in my house?” in the background when they were on the phone, and Ventura told her she was with Kid Cudi. One day in December 2011, Sean “Diddy” Combs showed up at Capricorn Clark's home, banging on her door. Clark testified that Combs, still holding the gun, told her, “Get dressed, we're going to go kill” him. When she tried to protest, Combs said, “I don't give a f**k what you want to do, go get dressed.” Clark said Combs was “livid, furious, mad at me.” “I had never seen him with a weapon, I had never seen him making me do something like this,” she said. Capricorn Clark's voice has been quivering through much of her testimony Tuesday morning. Capricorn Clark, former employee for Sean “Diddy” Combs and his Sean Jean fashion company, has started testifying about Cassie Ventura dating  the rapper Kid Cudi in December 2011. Clark, Ventura and Kid Cudi sometimes would hang out, she said. One time, Ventura texted her, asking if they could pick up Kid Cudi, and Clark told Ventura to delete the text because Combs paid for both of their phones, Clark testified. Kid Cudi testified last week that when he dated Ventura in December 2011, he believed at the time that Ventura was not romantically involved with Combs anymore. In 2011, Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs, was also managing Cassie Ventura as her creative director. Clark said Combs had final approval over everything, including Ventura's physical appearance and every opportunity Ventura could or couldn't take. Capricorn Clark, a former employee for Sean “Diddy” Combs, said she returned to work for the hip-hop mogul after a 2006 incident at his Miami home, but not directly under him. Clark testified that she accepted the director of marketing position for “Sean John” women's line because she didn't have to work directly with him. Capricorn Clark, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, recounted a time she was at Combs' Miami home in the summer of 2006. She said when she arrived, Combs told her, “I don't care what goes on this weekend, you are not to leave this house.” Clark said when she returned to Combs' home, he told her, “See, your problem is you want a life, and you can't have that here,” and again told her not to leave the house. The following day, Clark said she told Combs' chef, “I hate it here,” and the chef relayed that to Combs. “He immediately looked at me and said, ‘You hate it here?' Eventually, one of Combs' security guards intervened by telling Combs to stop and telling Clark to go pack her belongings. Clark testified she left her job after this incident because “it was crossing my boundary.” Capricorn Clark, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former employee, recalled a time when Combs had 100,000 euros that he made from club bookings in Europe. Capricorn Clark saw Sean “Diddy” Combs doing ecstasy and molly about once a week, in addition to prescription medication, she testified. A man called “One Stop” usually provided the drugs when they were in Los Angeles, and the drugs usually were delivered to her or to Combs directly, she said. Combs asked her to get him ecstasy fewer than 10 times, she said. Clark saw Combs offer drugs to his friends and girlfriends, she said. Clark also would get prescription drugs for Combs, she said. The testimony of Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs, should help corroborate both Kid Cudi and Cassie Ventura's testimonies, but the prosecution still has a lot to prove in other areas of the case, according to CNN legal analyst and former prosecutor Jennifer Rodgers. “It seems to me that (prosecutors) have decided to start with this bucket: Cassie Ventura, her testimony, and then all of the testimony that corroborates her,” Rodgers told CNN. “But I think the jury is thinking about this conspiracy… . Those other questions include laying out “where are the other conspirators – not only who did things for him, like any employee would, but who had a meeting of the minds, a criminal meeting of the minds that they were all together in this enterprise,” Rodgers said. As for how the prosecution may go about proving the alleged criminal acts Combs committed within his business empire, Rodgers said they need to “identify” people within his business who may have been “involved in the criminality of what they were doing.” Rodgers said they can also show that “through testimony,” with witnesses saying they were directly “criminally involved” or by naming others who “knew what was going on.” When Sean “Diddy” Combs traveled, his rooms were usually reserved under the names Frank Black or Frank White, Capricorn Clark, Combs' former assistant, testified. The name Frank Black was a reference to the late rapper and Bad Boy Records artist Notorious B.I.G., who had a nickname of Frank White. Clark said she would also bring candles to provide lighting in the rooms. After Combs' stay, Clark said she would sweep the room for anything left behind. She was never compensated for the overtime, Clark testified. Capricorn Clark, the former director of marketing for Sean “Diddy” Combs, typically worked from 9 a.m. until 4 a.m. as Combs' personal assistant without breaks for meals. Capricorn Clark, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, said that after he accused her of stealing diamond jewelry from him, she was given a lie detector test. “I'm not getting a good reading, you need to you're going to be in the East River if I cant get a reading on this,” Clark recalled the man saying. Eventually, one of Combs' security guard took her home and picked her up the next day to repeat the same process. Clark testified she was taken to the same vacant office building for questioning with the lie detector for five straight days. She said she didn't want to do it but thought the lie detector was the only way to prove her innocence. Clark testified that Combs never asked her where she was during those five days and he never mentioned the lie detector tests to her. One time, Sean “Diddy” Combs accused Capricorn Clark of stealing diamond jewelry that was on loan to him from a jeweler, the former assistant testified. Combs went on to Miami, leaving Clark with a security guard who questioned her for hours and then searched her apartment. Clark, Combs and his then-manager got into an elevator after Combs did an MTV event that also involved rapper 50 Cent, she said. Combs told his elevator companions he had an issue with 50 Cent, and after further conversation, Combs said, “I don't do that; I like guns,” Clark testified. On her first day working for Sean “Diddy” Combs in 2004, Capricorn Clark said he took her to Central Park with his security guard some time after 9 p.m. There, he brought up her former employment with Death Row Records, which was founded by Combs' rival Marion “Suge” Knight. The security guard stood by silently while Combs threatened her, Clark said. Capricorn Clark, the former director of marketing for Sean “Diddy” Combs, said she has been involved in the music industry since shortly after graduating from high school, when she landed an internship with Def Jam Records. After Def Jam, she worked for Death Row Records, which Suge Knight then managed. She then worked as Cassie Ventura's creative director from 2016 to 2018. The jury has entered, and prosecutors have called Capricorn Clark, a former director of marketing for Sean “Diddy” Combs, to the stand. Clark came up in last week's testimony by rapper Kid Cudi. As jurors head into a third week of testimony in the Sean “Diddy” Combs federal criminal case, prosecutors are still working to prove Combs was involved in a criminal enterprise, engaged in arson, kidnapping and other illegal acts. Not yet, according to CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney, Joey Jackson. Prosecutors are attempting to lay the foundation for the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs faces through witnesses who spoke about Combs' alleged involvement with arson and extortion, Jackson told CNN's Sara Sidner. Rapper Kid Cudi, who dated Combs' ex-girlfriend and key witness in trial, Cassie Ventura, testified and accused Combs of setting his Porsche on fire with a Molotov cocktail while he was dating Ventura. Last week, Ventura's mother testified about taking a home equity loan to get $20,000 to pay Combs, asked for to “recoup money he had spent” on her daughter “because he was angry that she had been in a relationship” with Kid Cudi. In order to further prove the racketeering charge, prosecutors need to establish “continuous use of the enterprise over a significant period of time, not just these one-off activities, and sexual exploitation and trafficking would lead to that.” Prosecutors “have to show more coercion and forced activity,” Jackson said. Prosecutors and defense attorneys are discussing some issues before the jury enters. Former Combs' employee Capricorn Clark is expected to testify today followed by witnesses from the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles Fire Department, according to prosecutor Maurene Comey. The jury has already heard from two other former assistants for Combs, George Kaplan, and David James. Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. “She didn't want to testify,” the source said, not providing any further details. Prosecutors allege some of these sex acts, known as “Freak Offs,” involved male sex workers who were transported across state lines. Gina has been described in testimony as an ex-girlfriend of Combs. CNN has reached out directly to Victim-3, regarding her participation in the case. Last week, Combs' former assistant George Kaplan testified that he once witnessed Combs throwing apples at Gina at his home in Miami. Cassie Ventura, the case's star witness and another former girlfriend of Combs, testified that Combs was unfaithful to her by continuously dating Gina during their 11-year relationship. Prior to the start of testimony at the trial, prosecutors indicated in early May that they may not call Victim-3 as a part of their case. Assistant US Attorney Maurene Comey said they “may” try to call her, but said that while she's under subpoena to testify, “she may not show up.” Comey noted that it's been difficult to get in touch with Victim 3's lawyer. Assistant US Attorney Christy Slavik said that Gina was “very much a part of this case,” adding that she was identified in the indictment. CNN has reached out to the prosecutor's office for comment. The government can call Gina if it wants to,” Agnifilo responded. CNN's Kara Scannell and Nicki Brown contributed to this post. As the second week of Sean “Diddy” Combs' racketeering trial wrapped up on Thursday, all eyes turned to another entertainer, Scott “Kid Cudi” Mescudi, whose explosive testimony about Combs included allegations of a burned-out Porsche and a frightened dog. CNN entertainment correspondent Elizabeth Wagmeister joined Laura Coates to break it all down on the latest episode of the “Trial By Jury: Diddy” podcast. Prosecutor Maurene Comey on Thursday said the first witness they'll call today will be former Sean “Diddy” Combs' employee Capricorn Clark. Comey said the prosecution's case is running on time. The jury has already heard from two other former assistants for Combs, George Kaplan and David James. The third week of testimony in Sean “Diddy” Combs' criminal sex trafficking trial begins today. Here's a look at who else has taken the stand so far:</p>

Travel expert Lee Abbamonte discusses air traffic control outages and Memorial Day travel statistics on ‘Fox News Live.' Travelers flying on United Airlines will need to follow a new rule when it comes to checking in for their flights. A United spokesperson told Fox News Digital, "Starting June 3, our check-in cutoff time for domestic flights will change to 45 minutes before departure." "The change brings greater consistency for our customers by aligning with our current checked baggage deadline and the check-in policies followed by most other airlines," the spokesperson added. Currently, the check-in cutoff time for domestic travel is 30 minutes, while international check-in times will remain unchanged at one hour. There are time limits for checking bags that vary by airport. Travelers should arrive a minimum of two hours before their scheduled domestic flights and three hours before scheduled international flights, the TSA advises. The international check-in times will remain unchanged at one hour. A TSA spokesperson told Fox News Digital the agency continues to urge passengers to get REAL IDs or bring other acceptable forms of ID for travel. "Summer travel is upon us, and there is still time to get a REAL ID," said the spokesperson. "The change brings greater consistency for our customers by aligning with our current checked baggage deadline and the check-in policies followed by most other airlines," the spokesperson added. Other forms of identification that are accepted in lieu of a REAL ID include a valid U.S. passport or passport card; DHS trusted traveler cards such as Global Entry; Department of Defense IDs; permanent resident cards; and border crossing cards. Those who do not have an acceptable form of ID may be subjected to further screening. A look at the top-trending stories in food, relationships, great outdoors and more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Deputy director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Madison Sheahan, flanked by Acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Todd Lyons, speaks during a news conference at ICE Headquarters, in Washington, Wednesday, May 21, 2025. Judge Brian E. Murphy in Boston found that the White House had “unquestionably” violated his earlier order that people must be given a chance to raise objections before being sent to another country that would put them in danger, even if they've otherwise exhausted their legal appeals. The U.S. says the order has wrongly stalled its efforts to carry out deportations of migrants who can't be returned to their home countries. WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge suggested the Trump administration was “manufacturing” chaos and said he hoped that “reason can get the better of rhetoric” in a scathing order in a case about government efforts to deport a handful of migrants from various countries to South Sudan. “From the course of conduct, it is hard to come to any conclusion other than that Defendants invite a lack of clarity as a means of evasion,” the Boston-based Murphy wrote in the 17-page order. Murphy oversees a case in which immigration advocates are attempting to prevent the Trump administration from sending migrants they're trying to deport from the U.S. to countries that they're not from without giving them a meaningful chance to protest their removal. In a hearing last week called to address reports that eight immigrants had been sent to South Sudan, Murphy said the men hadn't been able to argue that the deportation could put them in danger. Days later, the Trump administration filed another motion saying that Murphy was requiring them to hold “dangerous criminals in a sensitive location.” But in his order Monday he emphasized repeatedly that it was the government's “own suggestion” that they be allowed to process the men's claims while they were still abroad. “It turns out that having immigration proceedings on another continent is harder and more logistically cumbersome than Defendants anticipated,” Murphy wrote. The government has argued that the men had a history with the immigration system, giving them prior opportunities to express a fear of being deported to a country outside their homeland. And they've said that the men's home — Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and South Sudan — would not take them back. The Trump administration has increasingly relied on third countries to take immigrants who cannot be sent to their home countries for various reasons. Some countries simply refuse to take back their citizens being deported while others take back some but not all of their citizens. But the Trump administration has leaned on other countries to take them. In the Western Hemisphere, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama have all agreed to take some people being removed from the U.S., with El Salvador being the most controversial example because it is holding people deported from the U.S. in a notorious prison. The Trump administration has said it's exploring other third countries for deportations. Murphy said in his order that the eight men were initially told May 19 they'd be going to South Africa and then later that same day were told they were going to South Sudan. He noted that the U.S. government “has issued stark warnings regarding South Sudan.” He said the men had fewer than 16 hours between being told they were going to be removed and going to the airport “most of which were non-waking hours” and “limited, if any” ability to talk to family or a lawyer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Interior Secretary Doug Burgum speaks as his wife, Kathryn, and President Donald Trump listen, in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, Jan. 31, 2025, in Washington. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum arrives before President Donald Trump speaks during an executive order signing event in the East Room of the White House, Tuesday, April 8, 2025, in Washington. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration A Texas oil executive from Elon Musk's government efficiency team has been given sweeping powers to overhaul the federal department that manages vast tracts of resource-rich public lands, but he hasn't divested his energy investments or filed an ethics commitment to break ties with companies that pose a conflict of interest, records show. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum recently directed Tyler Hassen, who lacks Senate confirmation and has no public administration experience, to reorganize the Interior Department, which oversees some 70,000 employees in 11 agencies including the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Before joining DOGE, Hassen spent nearly two decades as an executive at Basin Holdings, an enterprise involved in the manufacture, sale and servicing of oil rigs worldwide. A financial disclosure report obtained by AP shows Hassen made millions annually from these companies, owned by John Fitzgibbons — an industry giant who is well-connected in Russia. “It's a dereliction of duty to offload decisions about staffing and funding at the Interior Department to someone who hasn't even been confirmed by the Senate,” said Kate Groetzinger, with the Center for Western Priorities, a nonpartisan conservation group. Do you have a confidential tip for an AP reporter? Department spokesperson Katie Martin said in an email that Hassen is helping achieve the president's vision for major changes, and Interior will “continue to prioritize retaining first responders, parks services and energy production employees.” Once inside Interior in January, Hassen reviewed “every single contract, every single grant,” and sent action items to Burgum, he told FOX News in an April interview. A draft copy of Interior's new strategic plan includes increasing “clean coal, oil, and gas production through faster permitting” while reducing regulations to “generate more revenue from lands and resources for the U.S. Treasury.” An old Facebook page for Tyler Hassen includes a 2010 photo of him at the “Samotlor Field, Western Siberia - largest oilfield in Russia.” He's been CEO of Red Wolfpack Resources since 2024 and was with Tellurian, a natural gas company, and EagleStone Resources before that, according to his LinkedIn page. Burgum named Hassen his assistant secretary for policy, management and budget in March, but changed his title in April to “principal deputy assistant secretary.” An assistant secretary requires Senate approval and an ethics commitment to resign positions that would create a conflict of interest. Kathleen Clark, a government ethics expert at Washington University in St. Louis, said Interior officials are committing fraud “by calling someone by a different name so that they don't have to file a really important document where they explain how they're going to comply with ethics standards.” Hassen sought to fire a top department lawyer in April for refusing to give him and other DOGE officials access to a highly sensitive personnel database as he pushed for massive department-wide staff reductions through buyouts, early retirements and layoffs. “In seeking to remove Tony Irish, Tyler Hassen has demonstrated his own unfitness for federal service,” PEER executive director Tim Whitehouse said in a press release. Jacob Malcom, a former Interior Department executive, said Burgum's order directing Hassen to make “appropriate funding decisions” for administrative changes and ensure “the appropriate transfer of funds, programs, records and property” is unconstitutional — Congress appropriates funds, not assistant secretaries. Although Hassen didn't file a divestment commitment, he did file a financial disclosure in February — revised five times, the most recent dated April 21 — revealing he made almost $4 million annually from Fitzgibbon's oilfield services companies. Hassen reported that he holds $50,001 to $100,000 worth of stock in Fitzgibbon's company Block Harvest, a cryptocurrency mining business that uses flared natural gas to run data centers. He reported owning $250,000 to $500,000 worth of stock in Fitzgibbon's Global Guardian, a security company. It's currently seeking authorization from Interior's Bureau of Land Management to expand its operations. Hassen's potential conflicts of interest have raised concerns among environmental groups and some U.S. lawmakers. “As a member of those industries, he's uniquely qualified to flag the ones they don't like.” Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine, the ranking Democrats on Interior's Senate and House oversight subcommittees, have demanded a stop to Hassen's large-scale reorganization. Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico told Burgum in a May 7 letter that “delegating sweeping authorities and responsibilities to a non-Senate confirmed person in violation of the Vacancies Reform Act is baffling and extremely troubling.”</p>

Fox News Digital spoke to Alabama State Auditor Andrew Sorrell about his personal experience being debanked and what states can do to stop it in the future EXCLUSIVE: Protecting Americans from being "debanked" has been a top priority for the State Financial Officers Foundation, and Fox News Digital spoke to a member of that organization, who said he was targeted himself, about the importance of that pursuit. "When I was initially debanked, I didn't realize I was getting debanked," Alabama Republican State Auditor Andrew Sorrell told Fox News Digital at the State Financial Officers Foundation conference in Orlando, Florida. "What happened was I just get a letter one day from our credit card company, from my gun store, Gold Guns and Guitars, and we get this curious letter in the mail, and it says that in 30 days, we're closing your account. And it didn't tell us why at all." Fox News Digital spoke to Alabama State Auditor Andrew Sorrell about his experience of being "debanked." "So we're doing about 2 million dollars in revenue, about a million and a half of that is done by credit card or debit card transactions, and I was really confused this time, because why would a credit card processor drop us?" "I called my insurance broker, and he said, ‘Oh yeah, this is happening to all gun stores,'" Sorrell said. "He said insurance companies are dropping all gun stores. Oh my goodness, I'm a victim of political debanking. Debanking is the phenomenon in which a bank customer has their accounts canceled, often with no explanation. Conservatives have long alleged that banks were unfairly targeting them in the practice, with banks specifically going after companies with conservative messaging or principles, including gun stores. In an interview with "Sunday Morning Futures" anchor Maria Bartiromo, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., said he had seen "numerous" examples of conservatives being debanked during the Biden administration. "Especially people that were involved in different energy-type businesses and things like that, as well as very well-spoken and outspoken conservative activists," Comer said in the interview. "So there are numerous instances, enough to open an investigation again. House Oversight and Accountability Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) said he had seen "numerous" examples of conservatives being debanked during the Biden administration. Sorrell told Fox News Digital he is "convinced this is happening to other people in Alabama," and that the problem doesn't stem from local community banks but from large national banks who were "pushed" by the Obama and Biden administrations. "I actually have some sympathy for these large banks, and I think passing debanking legislation at the state level might actually help some of these large banks, because they can go back, and they can say, I'm sorry, Alabama has now passed debanking legislation. "This is un-American, and it has to be stopped." Since the Trump administration took office in January, pushing back against political debanking has become a more prevalent conversation in government, including in the form of a bill from GOP Sen. Tim Scott to address regulatory language that has prompted financial institutions to debank those involved in certain industries. "It's clear that federal regulators have abused reputational risk by carrying out a political agenda against federally legal businesses," Scott said. "This legislation, which eliminates references to reputational risk in regulatory supervision, is the first step once and for all." Andrew Mark Miller is a reporter at Fox News.

Chicago was plagued by violence over Memorial Day weekend when 22 people were shot, including two fatally, ABC7 reported. One fatal shooting reportedly occurred when an argument erupted inside a vehicle on the city's Northwest Side in the Logan Square neighborhood on Saturday afternoon. Chicago police officers guard a crime scene after a shooting at the CTA Red Line station at 79th Street on Aug. 8, 2022. A 46-year-old man on the Northwest Side was shot in the head while inside his vehicle near Humboldt Park. The vehicle then crashed into another car and a pole. The suspect in that shooting also remains at large. Two other people were also shot near a Humboldt Park homeless encampment, and one was critically injured. Chicago has reportedly recorded 139 homicides so far in 2025. On the city's South Side, two people were sitting inside their home when they were shot. According to the Chicago Tribune, which keeps a running tally of the number of homicides in the city each year, 139 people have been slain in the troubled city so far in 2025, based on data through May 17. Last week, two Venezuelans living illegally in Chicago were arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in connection with a deadly mass shooting. Ricardo Granadillo Padilla, 25, and Edward Martinez Cermeno, 24, suspected members of the violent Tren de Aragua (TdA) street gang, were taken into custody by federal law enforcement for allegedly killing three and wounding five others after opening fire during a December house party. Over the Memorial Day weekend, 22 people were reportedly shot, including two killed, in Chicago. More than a dozen suspected TdA members were also arrested as part of the investigation into the shooting.

(AP) — American gymnastics icon Mary Lou Retton faces a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence following her arrest in her West Virginia hometown. According to the criminal complaint, Retton smelled of alcohol and was slurring her words, and she failed a field sobriety test. Officers also reported observing a container of wine in the passenger seat. Retton, 57, refused a roadside breath test and a blood test. She was released from custody after paying a $1,500 personal recognizance bond. Her attorney listed in court records, Edmund J. Rollo of Morgantown, did not immediately respond to phone and email requests from The Associated Press seeking comment. Retton was 16 when she became the first American female gymnast to win the all-around at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. She also won two silver and two bronze medals to help bring gymnastics into the mainstream in the United States. In 2023, Retton's family disclosed she was recuperating from a rare form of pneumonia that landed her in intensive care. Doctors found her oxygen levels dangerously low. Retton went on oxygen treatment and, after weeks in the hospital, improved enough to be sent home.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear an appeal from a Massachusetts middle school student who was forced to remove a T-shirt that claimed “there are only two genders.” Related article Supreme Court enters final stretch of term poised to decide cases on birthright citizenship, transgender care and religion The student, Liam Morrison, wore the shirt to Nichols Middle School in Middleborough, Massachusetts, in 2023 to “share his view that gender and sex are identical.” School administrators asked him to remove it and, when he declined, sent him home for the day. Weeks later, he wore the same shirt but covered the words “only two” with a piece of tape on which he wrote “censored.” The high court is already considering other cases dealing with LGBTQ+ rights, including a major challenge to Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for minors. David Cortman, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, which represented Morrison, called the Supreme Court's decision disappointing. Here, the school actively promotes its view about gender through posters and ‘Pride' events, and it encourages students to wear clothing with messages on the same topic,” Cortman said. “Our legal system is built on the truth that the government cannot silence any speaker just because it disapproves of what they say.” “We should reaffirm the bedrock principle that a school may not engage in viewpoint discrimination when it regulates student speech,” Alito wrote in his dissent. “By limiting the application of our viewpoint-discrimination cases, the decision below robs a great many students of that core First Amendment protection.” Related article Supreme Court declines to halt land transfer that would destroy sacred site for Western Apache In their written response to the Supreme Court, school officials noted they are aware of transgender and gender-nonconforming students “who had experienced serious mental health struggles, including suicidal ideation, related to their treatment by other students based on their gender identities” and that those struggles could impact the students' ability to learn.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The bucolic, vineyard-dotted Eastern Townships region of southern Quebec has a message for Americans: come hug it out. It's part of a CA$150,000 (US$109,000) ad campaign timed for the start of the summer travel season and aimed at US vacationers. Isabelle Charlebois, general director of Tourism Eastern Townships, said the video is meant to reassure American visitors that “they are not only expected this summer, but truly welcome.” If travelers need that encouragement, perhaps it's because amid a trade war and rising tensions some are wondering if it's the right time to visit Canada. “When our administration starts talking about making Canada the 51st state, I could understand if Canadian border patrol might be giving extra scrutiny to Americans,” said Brian Kirchhoff of Middlebury, Vermont. While he still plans to visit Montreal for next month's Canadian Grand Prix, Kirchhoff worries escalating rhetoric from the White House will have repercussions for Americans traveling abroad. Melissa Curtin McDavitt, a Fora Travel adviser in Los Angeles, California, was taken aback when clients cited concerns about politics and cancelled a planned girls getaway to Quebec City, a provincial capital that's among the safest cities in Canada. “We don't want to stir up trouble,” wrote one American on Reddit. Andrew Siegwart, president and CEO of the Tourism Industry Association of Ontario (TIAO), said Canadians working at hotels, resorts and other travel destinations are hearing similar concerns from Americans wondering if they should call off their plans. “Our members and operators across the province are fielding these types of questions,” Siegwart said. Such hesitations could have a big economic impact in Canada, where Americans made up nearly 79% of international visits in the third quarter of last year. US travelers spent $6.6 billion in the same period, according to Canada's national statistics office. US resident trips to Canada sagged in both February and March, the first year-over-year monthly decreases since 2021. About a third of TIAO members have reported lower summer-season bookings from American travelers when compared with the same period in 2024, Siegwart said. Like their counterparts in the Eastern Townships, members of the Ontario tourism industry are inviting Americans to visit — and telling them that they'll meet with a warm reception. “We really are ‘arms open' to the world and our US visitors,” Siegwart said, using a tagline that riffs on the “elbows up” slogan that's a rallying cry for Canadian resistance to Trump's tariffs. In western Canada, a group of tour operators specializing in grizzly bear viewing is launching a “Hey, Neighbor!” campaign this month, featuring small business owners speaking directly to Americans. “We've been hearing your questions up here in British Columbia. Other destinations in Canada are beckoning US travelers with reminders that their budgets go further north of the border. On April 28, Tourisme Montreal launched a “stretch your dollar” campaign with a real-time ticker tracking the exchange rate between US and Canadian currencies, which is currently very favorable to Americans. “In Montreal, we're privileged to have ties with the United States that are historical, cultural and geographical. “Montrealers are known for being warm, welcoming and open-spirited, which is not going to change.” Ad campaigns don't always mirror popular sentiment — and it's clear that events on the national level have sparked widespread anger in Canada. Nearly two-thirds of Canadians now see the United States as an “unfriendly” or “enemy” country, according to a YouGov poll last month; the same poll found that 61% are boycotting American companies. This winter, Canadian fans at NHL and NBA games took to booing the US national anthem. But surging Canadian pride really isn't hostile to Americans themselves, said Jessica Langer Kapalka, who co-owns Toronto's Canada-themed Grizzly Bar. At Grizzly Bar, visitors of all nationalities can enjoy Molson lager and elk-topped poutine in a space decked with portraits of Canadian greats from Celine Dion to David Suzuki. Plenty of everyday Canadians say they have no intention of taking out political frustrations on visitors — and some are going the extra mile to be neighborly. On April 26, some 500 people took him up on it, gathering for group photos with the mayor in Maffeo Sutton Park and nibbling the town's namesake dessert: Nanaimo bars. Responses to Americans' anxious social media queries have been largely friendly, too. Echoing a recurrent theme, one poster suggested that Americans come, but be sensitive: “Lay off the 51st state ‘jokes' and you are welcome with open arms. In response to the American who asked, on Reddit, if it's “appropriate” to visit, Blake Smith of Kitchener, Ontario, replied that even Canadians frustrated with US politics don't have a problem with Americans as people. “I think your average person in Canada likes to judge individuals by themselves, on their own merit … not as a deep red MAGA Republican or a blue Democrat,” he said, then weighed in with an invitation of his own. In Canada, he noted, it's still considered a bit impolite to talk too much about politics. Turn off the part of your brain that's doom scrolling,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>National Public Radio filed suit against the Trump administration on Tuesday for its move to withhold funds approved by Congress. NPR filed the suit along with three Colorado public radio stations in response to President Donald Trump's executive order to end funding for NPR and PBS, the Public Broadcasting Service. The lawsuit states the Trump administration has gone around congressional duties to direct how federal money is spent. “It is not always obvious when the government has acted with a retaliatory purpose in violation of the First Amendment. “The Order targets NPR and PBS expressly because, in the President's view, their news and other content is not ‘fair, accurate, or unbiased. Trump and his allies have called the public broadcasters “left-wing propaganda.” “The Executive Order is a clear violation of the Constitution and the First Amendment's protections for freedom of speech and association, and freedom of the press,” NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher said in a statement. Earlier this year, the Republican-led Congress passed a stopgap budget measure to fund CPB through the end of September 2027. In response to Trump's order, in which he said he was withholding CPB funding to NPR and PBS, the corporation's chief executive said the president did not have the authority to carry out such a move. “Congress directly authorized and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? China may have met an important climate goal — ahead of schedule. For decades, China's emissions soared ever higher as its economy grew, burning extraordinary volumes of coal, oil, and natural gas to light up cities, power factories, and fuel cars. The trend seemed unstoppable: At one point, China was approving two new coal power plants per week. It was an alarming prospect for the whole world. “If we're going to make real progress on climate change, that will require reductions from that 85 percent.” And since China is the single-largest emitter, there's no feasible way to meet international climate change targets without them on board. But now, for the first time, there's been a shift: China's greenhouse gas emissions have actually fallen even as energy demand went up. According to a new report at Carbon Brief by Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air, China's overall greenhouse gas emissions have dropped for the first time, thanks largely to the country's aggressive build-out of clean energy. Looking at official statistics and commercial data, the analysis shows greenhouse gas output fell 1 percent over the past year, even as China's overall energy use and economic activity increased. The growth rate of humanity's greenhouse gas emissions has begun to level off, but it has yet to decline. The decline of emissions in China is a big step toward this international goal, and the timing puts it on course for its own climate targets, too. China had previously committed to peaking its greenhouse gas emissions before 2030. “This is a little ahead of schedule,” Greenstone said. China deployed vastly more wind, solar, and nuclear power — sources that don't emit carbon dioxide — at a pace faster than its electricity demand growth. Meanwhile, its coal and gas electricity production dropped. China's emissions have dipped before due to economic slowdowns, so the fact that its economy grew while emissions declined is a significant turning point, putting China in a league with more than 30 countries, including the US, that have already done the same. China has established itself as the world's largest producer of solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and batteries, driving down prices for the global market. It's deploying these technologies within its own borders, as well as exporting them en masse, and some of its biggest customers are developing countries. Renewables accounted for 90 percent of new power capacity installed worldwide last year. Later this year, countries will gather in Brazil for the COP30 climate conference, where world leaders will hash out how to bring new, stronger commitments to cut their contributions to climate change by 2035. China's President Xi Jinping pledged that his country will come to the table with a comprehensive plan to further reduce its emissions across its economy, while the US may not show up at all. However, in the Carbon Brief report, Myllyvirta noted that China's small drop in emissions could easily go back up. If its economy grows even faster, demand for fossil fuels could rise again. China also emits greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide. In particular, China is releasing high levels of HFC-23, a byproduct of making nonstick coatings and a pollutant that is thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide when it comes to trapping heat in the atmosphere. Meanwhile, US emissions are also seeing a slight downward trend. But the Trump administration's push to extract more fossil fuels, cut incentives for clean energy, and roll back efforts to curb greenhouse gases mean that the US could become a larger climate polluter. That could offset some of the progress in China and slow the overall global endeavor to limit climate change. Why the Senate's repeal of California's gas car ban is such a big deal. This is what happens when you put a clownfish in hot water. Ganaderos han matado jaguares desde hace mucho tiempo. Now they're earning thousands of dollars to help save them. Dozens of countries have promised to end deforestation. The administration's attack on nature, explained by a dancing chicken.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The left-wing advocacy organization Southern Poverty Law Center listed the conservative Republican activist group Turning Point USA in its “2024 Year in Hate and Extremism Report.” Describing Turning Point Action as a “well-funded, hard-right organization with links to Southern Poverty Law Center-identified hard-right extremists and a tremendous amount of influence in conservative politics,” the SPLC provided multiple examples to justify its classification of Turning Point Action in its report. The organization was particularly critical of Turning Point Founder Charlie Kirk. “Kirk accused Democrats of embracing immigration as part of their plot to secure voters, permit crime and enact the ‘great replacement,'” read the report. Kirk blasted the SPLC's report in a post on X. The SPLC has added Turning Point to their ridiculous “hate group” list, right next to the KKK and neo-Nazis, a cheap smear from a washed-up org that's been fleecing scared grandmas for decades. They somehow still rake in over $100 million a year peddling their “hate map”… “The SPLC has added Turning Point to their ridiculous ‘hate group' list, right next to the KKK and neo-Nazis, a cheap smear from a washed-up org that's been fleecing scared grandmas for decades,” Kirk said. Even former staffers called their racket a ‘con. “But it's 2025, and nobody with a functioning brain buys their garbage anymore,” Kirk added. Maybe someone should take a hard look at where all that ‘nonprofit' money's really going?” Presidential adviser and SpaceX founder Elon Musk also chimed in, criticizing the SPLC. “Being on their list is a badge of honor,” Kirk said.</p>
