                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. military veteran Jake Wood has resigned from his position as executive director of the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) just weeks after its launch, amid heavy criticism from organizations that say that the U.S.- and Israel-backed group will hinder, not help, aid delivery in the starvation-stricken enclave. “I am proud of the work I oversaw, including developing a pragmatic plan that could feed hungry people, address security concerns about diversion, and complement the work of longstanding NGOs in Gaza,” said Wood in a statement on Monday. “However, it is clear that it is not possible to implement this plan while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence, which I will not abandon,” the former U.S. marine went on. “I urge Israel to significantly expand the provision of aid into Gaza through all mechanisms.” The group said in a statement after Wood's resignation that it is beginning aid delivery in Gaza despite Wood's resignation. The Israeli military said on Tuesday that the foundation, in collaboration with a private U.S. military company, is beginning operation of two aid centers. Though Wood cited humanitarian concerns for his resignation, he perhaps ignored that the U.S.-Israel plan for GHF has been condemned since the moment it was announced as a way for Israel to further its control over Gaza and push out any entities not entirely at the whim of Israeli leaders. Distressing scenes.The GHF American-Israeli mercenaries lost control over one of the small aid distribution centres, with hundreds of Palestinians falling into chaos.A helicopter reportedly took off and opened fire on the crowd.This has nothing to do with humanitarianism. “We have over 3,000 trucks, not only of food, but also medicines that are lining up in places like Jordan, like Egypt, that are waiting for the green light to go in, and they're carrying medicines and that is expiring soon,” said UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) spokesperson ​​Juliette Touma. In a letter released Tuesday, UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini again urged Israel to end its “disinformation campaign” against the agency — the central group providing and coordinating aid for Palestinians. Israel has not provided a shred of evidence for its claims against the agency, Lazzarini said, in over 20 months of accusations of criminality that the government is nonetheless using to disenfranchise the agency.

MOSCOW, May 27. /TASS/. Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev responded to US President Donald Trump's social media post that said Vladimir Putin is "playing with fire."

"Regarding Trump's words about Putin ‘playing with fire' and ‘really bad things' happening to Russia. I only know of one REALLY BAD thing — WWIII. I hope Trump understands this!" the Russian official said on X.

Trump said earlier on Tuesday that if it weren't for him "really bad things would have already happened to Russia." He said the Russian leader didn't understand that. The US president described this alleged lack of understanding as "playing with fire."</p>

The U.S. Department of State has issued new travel advisories for American citizens visiting Italy and Belgium due to the “risk of terrorist violence,” upgrading both countries to a Level 2 warning.

“Terrorists may attack with little or no warning,” the embassy bulletin said, adding that common targets may include public areas such as transportation centers, shopping malls, markets, tourist areas, local government offices, hotels, clubs, restaurants, and other sites.

The State Department did not explain why both countries were upgraded to “Level 2 - Exercise Increased Caution.”

There are four levels of travel advisories: Level 1 – Exercise Normal Precautions, Level 2 – Exercise Increased Caution, Level 3 – Reconsider Travel, and Level 4 – Do Not Travel. The highest level is usually reserved for war zones, countries with authoritarian governments, or areas with excessive criminal activity, such as kidnappings.

It comes as some countries in Europe have issued stronger advisories on traveling to the United States in recent months, including the UK and Germany.

A criminal convicted in the United States, overstaying a visa for a short period, giving false information, or other offenses can lead to arrest, detention, and deportation, Germany's foreign office further warned.

“Any further questions concerning entry into the USA should be clarified with the relevant U.S. diplomatic mission abroad well in advance of departure,” the office said.

“You may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules. If you're not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the U.S. Embassy or a consulate in the UK,” the country's government said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Doctors have kept Adriana Smith on breathing machines for three months due to the state's “heartbeat law.” A 30-year-old Black woman in Georgia has been kept on life support for three months against her family's wishes because of the state's “fetal heartbeat” anti-abortion law. Adriana Smith was declared legally dead in February after a medical emergency caused her brain function to cease. Smith, a nurse, had been initially turned away when she first sought medical care. She was nine weeks pregnant at the time. But because her medical providers would face legal consequences including jail time if they were to end the pregnancy, Smith's body is still being kept on breathing machines despite the fact that Smith herself can no longer be resuscitated. The case demonstrates once again that “it is deadly to be Black and pregnant,” says Monica Simpson of the reproductive justice organization SisterSong. Copy may not be in its final form. We turn now to Georgia, where there's growing concern about the plight of a pregnant woman who's been declared brain dead but has kept on life support for three months against the wishes of her distraught family because of Georgia's abortion ban. Adriana Smith is a 30-year-old mother and nurse who suffered a medical emergency in February due to blood clots in the brain, was declared legally dead. At that point, she was about nine weeks pregnant. She's now about 22 weeks pregnant, but doctors have kept her on breathing machines because her fetus was old enough to have detectable cardiac activity. This comes as Georgia's attorney general has said Georgia's heartbeat bill does not require medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death, and issued a terse statement that, quote, “Removing life support is not an action ‘with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy. In Washington, D.C., Mini Timmaraju is with us, president of Reproductive Freedom for All, formerly NARAL Pro-Choice America. And in Atlanta, we're joined by Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong, the national women of color reproductive justice collective that's based in Georgia, has a lawsuit against Georgia, arguing its six-week abortion ban is denying people in Georgia lifesaving care. We welcome you both back to Democracy Now! Can you talk about the situation right now, what the family wants for their beloved, brain-dead loved one who is pregnant and who doctors are keeping on life support? MONICA SIMPSON: Thank you so much for having me. It is a dire situation that we're dealing with here in Georgia. And we are constantly having to navigate this system that keeps showing us over and over again that it is deadly to be Black and pregnant in this state, where access to care is so far out of reach for so many people, and the limitations and the criminalization that we are constantly navigating now with this abortion ban is something that Georgians did not want, and it's something that we are constantly doing all that we can to push back against. Now, if the doctors would have been — did everything they could, maybe we would have been able to get a different outcome for Adriana. But, unfortunately, that's not what happened, because, unfortunately, that's not what happens for so many Black women in this country. And so, now her family is battling such a hard time. They should be able to take care of themselves and all of the family members who are having to deal with this ordeal. But, unfortunately, they're having to navigate so many unanswered questions. They're having to navigate something they shouldn't have to, which is an abortion ban that's connected to this issue, that should not even be at play at this particular moment. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And in Georgia, we're talking about one of the states that has among the worst maternal and infant mortality rates in the country, particularly for African American women and children. We are dealing in Georgia with maternal health deserts, right? Over half of our counties do not have access to an OB-GYN, so care is out of reach for so many. We are also a state that has yet to expand Medicaid, and we know, federally, we are still fighting for Medicaid to be something that Americans have access to, which means that there are thousands of people upon thousands of people who are falling in the cracks every single day, not having access to basic healthcare needs. So, when you add that to a state that has now put a six-week abortion ban in place, it makes it a very, very harsh environment for folks to be able to get access to what they need in terms of their reproductive healthcare. Georgia's Attorney General Chris Carr released a statement declaring that the six-week abortion ban doesn't require medical professionals to keep women alive on life support after they've been declared brain dead, Monica. MONICA SIMPSON: What I find very interesting about the times that we are in is that this abortion ban has created so many obstacles for people. There has been too many people who have tried to figure out what it means, when it means that, and that is the problem that we're dealing with here. We lost Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, right? These are two Black women who were also pregnant in our state that wanted to terminate a pregnancy and came up against the very real barriers that this abortion ban puts in place for folks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Decision was initially announced in February by Milei following Trump's footsteps Argentina has ratified its decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO) during a visit to Buenos Aires by the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr. Milei's government justified its departure from the UN agency in a statement on Monday. “The WHO's prescriptions do not work because they are not based on science but on political interests and bureaucratic structures that refuse to review their own mistakes,” the statement said. The announcement came as Kennedy and the Argentinian health minister, Mario Lugones, met to define “a joint work agenda that will strengthen transparency and trust in the health system”. We have similar visions about the path forward,” Lugones said. Kennedy, a controversial Trump pick for health secretary given his vaccine skepticism, is also expected to meet with Milei during his visit. In a video broadcast at the WHO's annual assembly last week, he urged other governments to withdraw from the agency and create other institutions. In his speech, Kennedy alleged that the UN health agency was under undue influence from China, gender ideology and the pharmaceutical industry. The Argentinian government also announced a “structural review” of national health agencies to “organize, update, and make transparent the structures and processes” of the health system “that for years operated with overlaps, outdated regulations and limited oversight”.</p>

The 57-year-old was charged with “driving under influence of alcohol, controlled substances, or drugs” on 17 May after police responded to reports of someone driving a Porsche erratically. After her gymnastics career, Retton remained active in the media, appearing in a number of films and TV shows. She was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 1997 and was the first woman to be selected into the Houston Sports Hall of Fame in 2020. Retton also served on the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under US president George W Bush. At the time her daughter Kelley said her mother was “fighting for her life” and started a fundraiser to cover medical costs for Retton, who did not have medical insurance. Donations to the fundraiser ended up totaling nearly $500,000. Retton recovered but said she had “faced death in the eyes” during her illness.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MOSCOW, May 27. The Ukraine peace process is in its early stages and is still very tenuous, making German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's statements about lifting long-range weapons restrictions on Kiev especially perilous, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Peskov pointed out that the German chancellor "confused everyone, and maybe was confused himself," as government officials had said the exact opposite the day before. "But, as you see, he persists and insists that such a decision has indeed been made and that Ukraine has been given permission to carry out attacks deep inside Russia with long-range missiles," the spokesman said. "If this is true, then it is an extremely dangerous decision. It moves us several steps closer to direct confrontation and, of course, runs counter to the tenuous peace settlement efforts that have just begun," he emphasized. Peskov added that instead of creating "uncertainty" for Russia, as it is trying to do, it will only create uncertainty for itself. "This uncertainty will become a burden for them. Let's see if they can cope with it," the spokesman noted. Earlier, Merz said that Germany and its allies, France and the United Kingdom, had allowed Ukraine to use their long-range missiles to attack deep within Russian territory.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>King Charles III used a significant speech in Canada's parliament on Tuesday to underscore the country's sovereignty following pressure from US President Donald Trump. It was the first time in nearly 50 years that a sovereign had delivered the address and was seen by many as a powerful show of support for Canada. King Charles' remarks comes as Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to annex Canada and make it the 51st state — a move which Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has repeatedly rebuffed. “The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades, is changing. “The Prime Minister and the President of the United States, for example, have begun defining a new economic and security relationship between Canada and the U.S., rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests, to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations,” he said. Charles also referenced protecting Canada's sovereignty, saying that the government would look at “rebuilding, rearming, and reinvesting in the Canadian Armed Forces.” He said the government “will boost Canada's defence industry by joining ReArm Europe, to invest in transatlantic security with Canada's European partners. And it will invest to strengthen its presence in the North, which is an integral part of Canada, as this region faces new threats.” The monarch added: “The government will discharge its duty to protect Canadians and their sovereign rights, from wherever challenges may come at home or abroad.” King Charles on Tuesday also emphasized that “the Crown has for so long been a symbol of unity for Canada,” adding that “it also represents stability and continuity from the past to the present.” Jeffrey Dvorkin, journalist and senior fellow at Massey College in Toronto, described the speech as a “delicate balancing act” after the recent unwanted attention from Trump, but one that touched upon key issues and tensions in Canada. Related article King Charles makes ‘impactful' trip to Canada as Trump pushes 51st state claim “What it also did — really quite deliberately — was send a message to the administration of Donald Trump that the country is going to go in a somewhat different direction than it has in the past,” he told CNN. But now under Prime Minister Carney, Canadians are looking overseas for a different set of connections without necessarily separating from the best connections that Canada has with the United States,” he continued. “But it certainly was a message to the Trump administration that those days of Canada accepting everything that the United States tries to do, those days are over.” On Monday, Carney – who was elected in March largely on an anti-Trump platform - praised the “historic ties” between Canada and the United Kingdom which “crises only fortify.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stand behind Ukrainian independent journalism when it's needed most. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on May 27 that Moscow would welcome a second round of peace talks with Ukraine in Istanbul, he said during a joint press conference with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. "If you ask me, I would turn to our Turkish friends again — Istanbul is very good," Lavrov said, according to state-owned news agency TASS. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on May 19 that Ukraine is open to a new round of talks in Turkey, Switzerland, or the Vatican. Lavrov, however, cast doubt on the Vatican as a host, arguing that it would be an unsuitable platform for talks between "Orthodox countries." The Turkish foreign minister, who met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kremlin negotiator Vladimir Medinsky during his visit, reaffirmed Ankara's readiness to facilitate future talks. Since then, Ankara has maintained active contact with both Kyiv and Moscow and facilitated multiple prisoner exchanges, as well as the now-defunct Black Sea Grain Initiative. No official date or venue for a second round of talks has been agreed. The renewed discussion about potential locations follows a May 19 call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all. Our goal: reach 20,000 members to prove independent journalism can survive without paywalls, billionaires, or compromise.</p>

But Reynolds learned some valuable lessons from his painful Hal Jordan experience: “Too much money and too much time wrecks creativity,” he has said. “And constraint is the greatest creative tool you can possibly have.” No amount of cash can save a poorly conceived idea. Due largely to studio shenanigans, he was forced to debut the character in the 2009 X-Men Origins: Wolverine but hated the portrayal that was foisted on him. He persevered until he won absolute creative freedom, and the first foul-mouthed, critically acclaimed Deadpool film, released in 2016, grossed US$782 million worldwide. He often becomes the quirky, hilarious spokesman for many of his investments, including Mint Mobile. Five years after he accrued a 25% stake, T-Mobile bought it for US$1.4 billion. He bought a majority stake in Aviation Gin in 2016; Diageo acquired the brand four years later for US$610 million, based largely on his genius as creative director.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Check out our new weekly Work Life newsletter. About once a month, I'll get assigned a task that requires one-on-one meetings with him, which is anxiety-inducing and stressful. I don't want to leave my job, but what are some strategies I can use to cope with being around the company owner? How can I tactfully request that my manager not put me on tasks that involve time with the owner? In a values and purpose-based workplace culture, we understand that every interaction – even the challenging ones – offers valuable insight into how we relate, communicate and influence one another. Your stress around the company owner is completely valid and rather than seeing it solely as a problem, it can be viewed as a meaningful signal – an opportunity to reflect on your boundaries, needs and energy. Rather than approaching this situation with avoidance, consider shifting how you prepare for and engage in these moments. Before your meetings, ground yourself – take a few deep breaths, remind yourself of what you bring to the table and set a clear intention to remain steady and composed. This helps you stay aligned with your values, regardless of someone else's behaviour. You might say something like: “I work best in calm, collaborative settings. I find it difficult to stay focused and confident when I work directly with [the owner] and it impacts my ability to deliver my best. Would it be possible to adjust how these tasks are assigned so I can continue contributing effectively?” This isn't about avoiding responsibility – it's about making intentional choices that support your well-being and performance. With clear communication and a centred mindset, you can create more peace within yourself while continuing to make a meaningful contribution. Empowerment doesn't always require dramatic action – sometimes, it comes from quiet self-awareness and conscious choices about where your energy goes. Bruce Sandy, principal, Pathfinder Coaching & Consulting, Nanoose Bay, B.C. I am curious why you hate your boss/the owner of the company. There are a number of rude, brash and dismissive people in the world. If you have unresolved abuse (and/or) trauma caused by someone similar to your boss in your past, then you will want to consider speaking to a therapist or counsellor about this. Be curious about how this avoidance of dealing with the owner may impact you in your job and the workplace. If it is not possible to avoid contact with the owner, then ask your direct manager about how best to work with the owner. Does your boss/owner have any redeeming qualities that you appreciate? If so, list these and focus on them. If you cannot avoid the owner, then be professional, respectful and set clear boundaries with him. Also, ask if he has any constructive feedback for you at the end of meetings. You may want to have your direct manager or someone else involved in the meetings until you become comfortable interacting with the owner by yourself.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EU officials in charge of enforcing Russia sanctions have lamented a major disconnection with Washington, following US President Donald Trump's change in policy towards Moscow. Since the Ukraine conflict escalated in 2022, the US and EU have imposed sweeping sanctions to isolate Russia, including bans on seaborne oil, asset freezes, and restrictions targeting the country's economy, trade, and defense sectors. Recent efforts have focused on alleged sanctions evasion, citing purported attempts by Russia to acquire weapons components through third parties using a so-called “shadow fleet,” a Western term for tankers operating outside recognised insurance systems. The EU has been pushing for additional measures to prevent vessels from operating, including by sanctioning Russia's trade partners, such as China. “There is no more joint outreach,” he reportedly admitted, adding that G7 cooperation has also “lost momentum.” US President Donald Trump has threatened tougher sanctions on Russia if negotiations to end the Ukraine conflict fail, without naming any concrete proposals. Officials cited in the report believe he is looking to restore business ties sooner rather than later. A recent Bloomberg report citing EU sources also claimed the US has become “unresponsive” in working groups focused on sanctions enforcement. The next EU sanctions package is expected to target Russia's energy and banking sectors, the report notes, but its approval is now uncertain. Hungary, which has repeatedly opposed sanctions, is reportedly blocking key elements of the proposal. Washington's fading support has further cast doubt on its passage. German MEP Sergey Lagodinsky told Süddeutsche Zeitung that a full US withdrawal from the sanctions regime would likely bring the entire system to a halt. Moscow has repeatedly denounced Western sanctions as illegal and ineffective, arguing they have failed to destabilize the Russian economy and have instead backfired on the countries that imposed them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>El Zonte was transformed after Nayib Bukele made currency legal tender — but now the bubble has burst The road to El Zonte was, quite literally, paved by Bitcoin. Just a few years ago, surfers sniffing out the region's world-class waves would have to drag their boards down dirt roads to reach this stretch of tropical shoreline. But after Nayib Bukele, the self-described “world's coolest dictator”, announced in 2021 that El Salvador would become the first country to make Bitcoin a legal tender, this small seaside town of 3,000 people was transformed. The region had already been branded “Bitcoin Beach” – ground zero of the country's cryptocurrency experiment – but Mr Bukele's controversial crypto-policies turned what had been a trickle of interest into a tsunami. Roads were quickly laid to welcome the influx of crypto-enthusiasts descending on their decentralised fiscal mecca, with almost every sign lining the streets boasting some form of Bitcoin reference. Hotels, restaurants, apartment complexes have all cropped up – with construction sites on every corner as builders struggle to keep up with demand. But Mr Bukele's Bitcoin bubble now appears to have burst. As part of the agreement, Salvadorian merchants are no longer compelled to accept the cryptocurrency as payment and Mr Bukele agreed on paper to stop buying Bitcoin with public cash – the country currently owns more than 6,000 Bitcoin – although he has since said their strategy is not stopping. While he does not think the IMF deal will impact life in El Zonte, where Bitcoin is already enmeshed in the community, he worries it could cause some Bitcoiners to get “cold feet”. When Mr Bukele announced Bitcoin would be a legal tender, he saw an “influx” of Bitcoiners from all over the world arrive. Talking to The Telegraph after giving a short lesson on investing in the courtyard outside his shop, he adds: “From a tourist perspective, you know, I don't feel that excitement anymore... Yesterday, I went to buy food at the grocery store in Bitcoin. “I don't know what's gonna happen over the next six months if it were to change... Mr Avendano believes it's not just Bitcoin pulling foreigners to El Salvador, but the country's safety. To combat gang violence, Mr Bukele enforced a “state of exception” in 2022, rounding up and imprisoning more than 80,000 people without due process. His administration also built the notorious Cecot mega-prison, where Donald Trump has since deported Venezuelan migrants the White House claims are gang members. Walter Mena, a Salvadorian lawyer, was reluctant to open a business before Mr Bukele, when even El Zonte was overrun by gangs and it was not uncommon for people to be shot dead on the beach. Mr Mena, who accepts Bitcoin payment for his legal services, does not think the IMF deal will make any difference. Wealthy foreigners have been investing in the area, buying land, building homes and starting businesses. But prices have increased, and for each tale of one local making enough money to buy a new motorcycle with Bitcoin, there are stories of those who lost thousands in the volatile market. Surf teacher Isaac Reyes, 28, who is from El Zonte, says there have been more positive impacts than negative on the local community. He is sometimes paid in Bitcoin but he and most of the locals transfer it straight into dollars using an app on their phone. M moved to El Salvador from London in 2021 after he broke up with his girlfriend and read about Mr Bukele. M, 28, who did not want to give his full name, now lives in San Salvador. He first bought Bitcoin almost a decade ago when he was at university and now works for a hardware Bitcoin devices firm. He invested his life savings in 2014, when one Bitcoin was worth around $311. El Salvador, by contrast, he says is like the Wild West. James Bosworth, the founder of Hxagon, a firm which provides political risk analysis with a focus on Latin America, is also unconvinced the IMF deal will have much of an impact. “It's probably more a function of the initial hype cycle about El Salvador's Bitcoin drawing down and global macro factors (likely recession hits all tourism),” he says. He adds: “There are only so many people who might relocate and most of them jumped early. For anyone still considering it, the IMF agreement didn't change much.” Dr Peter Howson, an assistant professor at Northumbria University who has written books on cryptocurrency, thinks Mr Bukele's Bitcoin experiment has been a “failure”. In 2023, eight out of 10 Salvadorians did not use cryptocurrency, according to a survey by the University Institute of Public Opinion (Iudop) at the José Simeón Cañas Central American University (UCA). Meanwhile, only a fraction of remittances sent back to El Salvador from relatives abroad, which accounts for 25 per cent of the country's GDP, were sent with Bitcoin. “It might be popular with tourists that have come for the novelty of being able to do something useful with their Bitcoin, but other than that it was a failure,” Dr Howson says. He adds: “I think just because there's this IMF deal in place, I think there's still going to be some fondness for Bitcoin and silly policies down the road.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stand behind Ukrainian independent journalism when it's needed most. Calin Georgescu, a Moscow-friendly Romanian politician who ran for president in November 2024, announced on May 26 that he is retiring from politics. In a video address posted online, Georgescu said he had made a personal choice to become a mere "observer of public and social life" and devote more time and energy to his family. Romania's Constitutional Court later annulled the vote due to credible evidence of foreign interference in Georgescu's favor, namely from Russia. Georgescu was later barred from participating in a rerun in May as he faces multiple criminal charges over suspected promotion of fascist ideologies and Romania's World War II-era leader, Ion Antonescu, who oversaw the Holocaust in the country. After Georgescu was banned from running for president, far-right Eurosceptic George Simion became the leading nationalist candidate instead but was defeated in the runoff on May 18 by pro-EU centrist Nicusor Dan. "The world is weary of conflict, war, haste, violence, and political excess," Georgescu said. Georgescu thanked all those who supported him, claiming they had been "harassed, humiliated, and marginalized," and extended his gratitude also to his opponents. The former candidate has vowed to end Romania's assistance to Ukraine and once suggested that Bucharest could take part in the country's post-war partition, drawing a rebuke from Kyiv. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. From 2021 to 2025, he served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs in the Biden administration. For decades, such a pact was neither possible nor necessary. Today, in the face of a growing threat from China, it is both viable and essential. After decades of pouring resources into its armed forces, China could soon have the military strength to make that vision a reality. As CIA Director William Burns revealed in 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed his military “to be ready by 2027 to invade Taiwan.” But as Burns went on to note, China's leaders “have doubts about whether they could accomplish that invasion.” To sustain those doubts—concerning Taiwan but also other potential targets in the region—should be a top priority of U.S. foreign policy. It has moved more mobile and lethal military forces to strategic locations across Asia. Crucially, it has overhauled its security partnerships in the region. In past decades, Washington's principal focus was to forge close bilateral ties. In recent years, by contrast, the United States has pursued a more networked approach that gives U.S. allies greater responsibilities and encourages closer ties not just with Washington but among the allies themselves. These changes are creating novel military and geopolitical challenges for Beijing, thereby reinforcing China's doubts about the potential success of aggression. The new, more multilateral approach marks a critical step toward stronger deterrence. But the defense initiatives it has produced remain too informal and rudimentary. In the face of continued Chinese military modernization, true deterrence requires the will and capability that only a collective defense arrangement can deliver. Skeptics may argue that such an arrangement is infeasible with a Trump administration that appears to disavow the importance of the United States' alliances. But the reality is that leaders in Washington and allied capitals are still working to deepen military cooperation in the Indo-Pacific despite economic and diplomatic tensions. After World War II, the United States crafted a network of alliances in the region, hoping to keep Soviet expansion at bay, entrench its own military presence—particularly in East Asia—and curb internecine tensions among its partners. This network, made up of separate security arrangements with Australia and New Zealand, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand, served its constituents well. Notably, the network never evolved beyond a set of disparate and almost exclusively bilateral alliances. As John Foster Dulles, one of the architects of the U.S. postwar security order, wrote in these pages in 1952, shortly before becoming secretary of state: “It is not at this time practicable to draw a line which would bring all the free peoples of the Pacific and East Asia into a formal mutual security area.” For their part, many Asian leaders preferred strong bilateral relationships with the United States over closer links with former adversaries or historical rivals. Others doubted that any such institution could overcome the legacies of conflict and mutual distrust among their neighbors and bring together members that were far apart both geographically and in terms of security concerns. It suffered from a lack of unity and quietly dissolved in 1977. The conditions once preventing multilateral alignment in Asia are giving way to fresh calls for collective defense. Just before taking office last year, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba warned that “the absence of a collective self-defense system like NATO in Asia means that wars are likely to break out.” In fact, such a collective defense pact is now within reach. China's assertiveness throughout the Indo-Pacific is spreading a sense of insecurity, particularly as leaders in Beijing lean on the military as a central instrument in their revisionist aims. The dangerous and threatening activities of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), combined with its rapidly growing capabilities, have prompted leaders across the region to adopt new defense strategies arrayed against what they perceive as a growing threat from China. Nowhere is this strategic reorientation more apparent than in Tokyo. Despite deep economic interdependence between China and Japan, ties between the two countries have been frail for decades, strained by historical animus, trade tensions, and territorial disputes. Relations have only worsened in recent years, as Beijing has leveraged its budding economic and military power to ramp up pressure on its neighbor. A new law, passed in 2021, allows China's coast guard to use weapons against foreign ships sailing in what Beijing considers its sovereign waters. In the years since, Chinese incursions into the areas surrounding what Japan refers to as the Senkaku Islands—administered by Japan but also claimed by China, which refers to them as the Diaoyu Islands—have become more frequent, with greater numbers of larger and more heavily armed vessels. In March, Chinese coast guard ships entered the territorial waters around the islands and lingered for nearly 100 hours—the longest episode to date in a string of incidents that Japan's top diplomat described as “clearly escalating.” Tokyo is responding by loosening long-standing political and legal constraints on its armed forces. As early as 2013, the country's first-ever publicly released national security strategy warned of China's “rapidly expanded and intensified” activities around Japanese territories. Not long after, the Japanese government reinterpreted the country's pacifist constitution, allowing its armed forces to work more closely with partner militaries. In recent years, it has embarked on a historic military buildup, pledging to double its military spending to roughly two percent of its gross domestic product. Tokyo has also moved beyond its erstwhile focus on defensive capabilities and now aims to acquire and deploy “counterstrike capabilities,” including hundreds of long-range Tomahawk missiles. Today, the insurgency has weakened, but an external threat looms larger and larger: steady Chinese encroachment on Philippine maritime rights and sovereignty, primarily in the South China Sea. China has cordoned off one of these atolls, Scarborough Shoal, denying access to Philippine fishing vessels. At another reef, Second Thomas Shoal, violent attacks by Chinese vessels have disrupted efforts to resupply Philippine military personnel. Chinese coast guard ships have even harassed vessels conducting energy exploration inside the Philippines' exclusive economic zone. Beginning under President Rodrigo Duterte in the late 2010s and accelerating under his successor, Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., the Philippine military has been undertaking an ambitious modernization effort. The government adopted a watershed defense strategy in 2024 to secure the country's periphery with investments in additional combat aircraft, tougher cyberdefenses, and more unmanned assets for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. There is little doubt about what is driving the overhaul: the need to better monitor and confront China's coercive activities. In Canberra, a few thousand miles to the south, the rise of China was once considered benign and beneficial to Australian interests. Revelations of malign Chinese Communist Party influence in Australian elections and policymaking ignited a political firestorm. And after Australia's government called for an independent investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, China unleashed a barrage of tariffs and other restrictions on Australian exports. In the South China Sea, Australian armed forces have suffered the same malign pattern of harassment by Chinese jets and warships. The PLA is also operating closer than ever to Australia's shores. Earlier this year, Chinese naval vessels circumnavigated Australia and disrupted commercial air traffic with live-fire exercises in the Tasman Sea. And amid intense efforts by China to make security inroads with Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and other Pacific Island countries, Australia's foreign minister said in 2024 that her country is now “in a state of permanent contest in the Pacific.” Against this backdrop, Canberra, too, is revising its defense priorities from top to bottom. As recently as 2016, the government's official view was that a foreign military attack on its territory was “no more than a remote prospect.” By 2024, its updated national defense strategy warned that, owing to the present realities in the Indo-Pacific, “there is no longer a ten-year window of strategic warning time for conflict.” Instead of preparing for a wide variety of contingencies around the world, including counterterrorism in the Middle East, the Australian Defence Force is gearing up to fend off major threats closer to home. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has unveiled plans for record military spending, including major investments in stockpiles of critical munitions such as long-range fires, antiship missiles, and missiles for air defense. The public shares that apprehension: according to the Lowy Institute, a leading Australian think tank, the share of Australians who believed China would become a military threat to their country nearly doubled from 2012 to 2022. Japan, the Philippines, and Australia have not only come to recognize China as their primary and common threat; they also increasingly acknowledge that their fates are intertwined with the broader region. This is true even on issues as sensitive as Taiwan, once a taboo subject in the region: “A Taiwan emergency is a Japanese emergency,” former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared in 2021. “If something happens to Taiwan, inevitably we will be involved,” the Philippine military chief warned earlier this year. Analysts have described defense cooperation between Australia and Japan in particular as taking on “alliance-like characteristics.” A new reciprocal access agreement allows the Australian and Japanese militaries to operate in each other's countries. August 2023 marked the first-ever visit by Japanese F-35 fighter jets to northern Australia, followed only days later by the inaugural deployment of Australian F-35s for military exercises in Japan. Japan is finalizing a similar access agreement with the Philippines, which has emerged in recent years as the largest recipient of Japanese security assistance. In February, defense leaders from the two countries announced a spate of measures for closer security cooperation. In what could be read only as a thinly veiled reference to China, the Philippine secretary of defense explained that Manila and Tokyo's “common cause” was to resist “any unilateral attempt to reshape the global order.” The Biden administration in particular worked to supplement the older “hub-and-spokes” model with what it envisioned as a “latticework” of relationships in Asia. The AUKUS partnership brought together Canberra, London, and Washington to help Australia build conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines. American officials also stepped up trilateral security cooperation with Japan and South Korea. Among the many partners involved in these efforts, Canberra, Manila, and Tokyo frequently stand out as common denominators. Later that year, Australian, Japanese, and U.S. defense leaders unveiled another set of cooperative activities, including three-way military exercises and advanced defense industrial cooperation. Perhaps most promising of all is a new grouping that brings together all four of these parties—Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and the United States. There are no mutual defense obligations between U.S. allies, only with the United States. There is no central headquarters to plan and conduct multilateral operations. And the unofficial nature of these groupings means that there is no regular drumbeat of planning among political and military staffs. As a result, it rarely receives the necessary urgency, attention, and resources. A collective defense pact would deliver where the current mechanisms fall short. Getting there would not require a panregional security organization such as NATO, which grew from 12 original members to over 30. As an advanced and stalwart ally in East Asia, South Korea would be an obvious candidate, and its contributions could be quite significant. But Seoul would have to decide whether it was willing to focus its defense forces more on China, partner more closely with Japan, and support a broader regional orientation for its own military and the tens of thousands of U.S. troops stationed on the peninsula. But although New Zealand has recently shown greater willingness to challenge China and align more closely with the United States, it might not yet be prepared to enter a formal collective defense pact. Critical U.S. partners such as India and Singapore would not be expected to join at the outset but could still participate in certain activities as observers or in some other nonmember capacity, as is common in regional groupings. As for the United States' European allies, they are neither politically nor militarily ready to join as full members right now, but that option could be considered in the future, under different circumstances. Larger defense budgets in Europe could produce militaries with more global reach, provided the continent itself is secure and at peace. Given that alliances with the United States already exist, a first-order task is to establish mutual obligations among Australia, Japan, and the Philippines themselves. This will demand skillful leadership and intense negotiations, but the benefits of stronger deterrence and greater security should outweigh the risks of closer alignment. One such project is the Bilateral Intelligence Analysis Cell, a new U.S.-Japanese effort at Yokota Air Base that monitors Chinese activity in the East China Sea. Likewise, the recently inaugurated U.S.-Philippine Combined Coordination Center near Manila could include Australia and Japan, providing similar functions in the South China Sea. The U.S. military has major operating bases in Japan, access to locations in the Philippines, and regular rotations of U.S. troops throughout Australia. With sufficient legal underpinning—including reciprocal access agreements among the three Asian allies— each of these arrangements could be expanded to include forces from the other members. The four members could also invest in shared military facilities. Major bilateral and trilateral military exercises involving different combinations of the partners could include all four. Together, they could more readily pre-position weapons to ensure sufficient stockpiles in the event of conflict, further strengthening deterrence. The four countries should establish a series of working groups to negotiate the full range of policy and legal issues associated with more integrated planning and operations. In addition to deepening their collective cooperation with one another, U.S. allies will also need to rebalance their bilateral security partnerships with Washington. In their current form, those partnerships reflect the asymmetries of a different era, when American military primacy appeared uncontested and immutable. Bilateral treaties in the region were restricted in scope to specific local geographies, and the contributions of allied militaries were limited by design. Domestic politics in the United States also makes greater reciprocity necessary. U.S. President Donald Trump has focused in particular on the notion that allies need to pay their “fair share,” casting doubts on whether the United States would defend NATO members that failed to meet certain levels of military spending. U.S. allies do need to spend more on defense—but reciprocity should extend far beyond bigger military budgets. Washington's security treaty with Tokyo, for instance, is bound only to “the territories under the administration of Japan.” The resulting imbalance is on display at every major bilateral summit, where U.S. leaders reaffirm their commitment to defend Japan and Japanese leaders stay silent on whether their forces would assist the U.S. military elsewhere. The upshot of more mutual obligation would be that U.S. allies could take on new roles and missions in crises and conflicts, especially when combined with recent investments in their own militaries. This would, in turn, open new pathways for cooperation that do not exist today in sufficient form: members of the pact could draft combined military plans, more effectively target their defense spending toward specialized and complementary capabilities, and rehearse and improve together through tailored military exercises and operations. These measures would fortify the collective power and deterrence of the United States' alliances far beyond what is possible under today's informal mechanisms. Greater reciprocity should also entail greater clarity on what military strategists refer to as “access, basing, and overflight”—that is, the ability of the U.S. military to operate in and around allied territory. Given the vast distances involved, forward-deployed U.S. forces are essential to ensuring rapid response times and sustaining the military during a contingency. More assured access would also lead to greater infrastructure investments and the deployment of more advanced capabilities, which further enhance the potential utility of various locations. While U.S. allies should not be expected to give the U.S. military a blank check, a robust Pacific Defense Pact will require more flexible and assured access for U.S. forces. Short of a severe break in ties, the four partners should work as best they can to silo security cooperation from economic and diplomatic disagreements. The stakes are simply too high to do otherwise. It is also worth underscoring that the demand for more reciprocal relationships has become a political and strategic imperative that spans the partisan divide in Washington. The evidence to date is that the United States and its Indo-Pacific allies are managing to deepen defense cooperation despite political and economic headwinds. To be sure, the Trump administration may be too divided, distracted, or confrontational to play the winning hand it has been dealt. Beyond strategic arguments about deterrence and national security, the United States can support these conversations by highlighting the potential benefits to its allies' domestic constituencies. These could include technology sharing, infrastructure investments, and improved disaster response. Given the historic significance of such an arrangement, Washington should also be prepared to manage reactions and concerns from others in the Indo-Pacific. U.S. officials can underscore that a Pacific Defense Pact would be but one of several components of its approach to the region. Moreover, the pact should remain focused on defense rather than subsuming or taking on the economic and diplomatic roles of other important institutions. Indeed, the pact will be most successful if complemented by a robust regional trade agenda, active diplomatic efforts, and effective foreign assistance programs. China has long accused the United States of “Cold War thinking” and “bloc politics.” PLA officials have already warned that current U.S. efforts to bring American security partners closer together are “tying the region's countries to the U.S. war chariot.” These refrains will feature prominently in China's reaction precisely because a stronger coalition could stymie Beijing's revisionist ambitions. To push back and make potential members think twice about a new pact, Beijing will likely draw from its traditional playbook of disinformation and economic coercion. With that in mind, the United States should help its allies prepare for China's efforts to scuttle a collective defense arrangement in Asia. But neither was the great progress that Washington's allies have already made, not only in acknowledging the threat from China but also in taking unprecedented steps to invest in their own militaries, build ties with their neighbors, and double down on their alliances with the United States. In fact, in recent years, Australia, Japan, and the Philippines have already made moves on defense and security matters that were previously deemed implausible. The conditions are now set for strong leadership to transform a collective defense pact in Asia from something once unimaginable into a defining feature of the region's future peace and prosperity.
