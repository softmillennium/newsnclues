King Charles III used a significant speech in Canada's parliament on Tuesday to underscore the country's sovereignty following pressure from US President Donald Trump.
    


            “Today, Canada faces another critical moment. Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination, and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear, and ones which the Government is determined to protect,” the king said from the throne in the Senate chamber as he delivered a speech, which laid out the Canadian government's legislative agenda for the year ahead.
    


            Charles, 76, is on a two-day trip to Canada, the first time he has visited the country since assuming the throne in 2022. He is the head of state in Canada and 13 other Commonwealth realms, as well as in the United Kingdom.
    


            It was the first time in nearly 50 years that a sovereign had delivered the address and was seen by many as a powerful show of support for Canada.
    


            King Charles' remarks comes as Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to annex Canada and make it the 51st state — a move which Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has repeatedly rebuffed.

            During the roughly 26-minute address, which was written by the Canadian government, Charles spoke of the several challenges the nation faced. “The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades, is changing. Canada's relationships with partners are also changing.”
    


            King Charles discussed the changing relationship between Canada and the United States.
    


            “The Prime Minister and the President of the United States, for example, have begun defining a new economic and security relationship between Canada and the U.S., rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests, to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations,” he said.
    


            Charles also referenced protecting Canada's sovereignty, saying that the government would look at “rebuilding, rearming, and reinvesting in the Canadian Armed Forces.”
    


            He said the government “will boost Canada's defence industry by joining ReArm Europe, to invest in transatlantic security with Canada's European partners. And it will invest to strengthen its presence in the North, which is an integral part of Canada, as this region faces new threats.”
    


            The monarch added: “The government will discharge its duty to protect Canadians and their sovereign rights, from wherever challenges may come at home or abroad.”
    


            King Charles on Tuesday also emphasized that “the Crown has for so long been a symbol of unity for Canada,” adding that “it also represents stability and continuity from the past to the present.”
    


            Charles and his wife, Camilla, made their way to parliament by carriage through the streets of the capital.
    


            As the king formally opened a new session of parliament, he outlined some of Carney's other priorities, which also focused on domestic issues such as more affordable housing, a tax cut for the middle class and the removal of barriers to interprovincial trade — themes the prime minister promised voters during the recent election campaign.
    


            The king alternated between speaking in English and French – the two official languages of Canada – and received a standing ovation after wrapping up the speech.
    


            Jeffrey Dvorkin, journalist and senior fellow at Massey College in Toronto, described the speech as a “delicate balancing act” after the recent unwanted attention from Trump, but one that touched upon key issues and tensions in Canada.

            “What it also did — really quite deliberately — was send a message to the administration of Donald Trump that the country is going to go in a somewhat different direction than it has in the past,” he told CNN.
    


             “Geography has been the greatest uniting force. But now under Prime Minister Carney, Canadians are looking overseas for a different set of connections without necessarily separating from the best connections that Canada has with the United States,” he continued.
    


            “But it certainly was a message to the Trump administration that those days of Canada accepting everything that the United States tries to do, those days are over.”
    


            King Charles and Queen Camilla were warmly welcomed on the tarmac as the couple touched down in Ottawa on Monday afternoon by Carney and Canadian Governor General Mary Simpson, the monarch's representative in the country.
    


            On Monday, Carney – who was elected in March largely on an anti-Trump platform - praised the “historic ties” between Canada and the United Kingdom which “crises only fortify.”

US President Donald Trump is considering a complete withdrawal from the Ukraine peace process due to a lack of progress, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing sources. The US leader, however, is reportedly reluctant to tighten sanctions against Russia.

Trump appeared to express the sentiment following a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week as he spoke with several European leaders, the NYT reported. 

During the conversation, Trump shared his impression that “Putin thought he was winning the war and would press his advantage,” according to officials briefed on the matter. They also reportedly indicated that Trump “made it clear he had no intention on putting pressure, much less harsh economic sanctions, on Russia.”

“He said, essentially, ‘I'm out,'” an NYT source claimed. At the same time, the paper would not say whether Trump, who has been skeptical of US aid to Ukraine and has yet to approve new assistance packages, might be willing to continue military support for Kiev.

Trump, who has described the Ukraine conflict as “Europe's war,” was shocked by Moscow's unwillingness to change its key terms of resolving the crisis, according to the NYT. Russia has insisted that any sustainable peace must include guarantees of Ukraine's neutrality, its demilitarization, denazification, and recognition of the new territorial reality on the ground.

A separate Wall Street Journal report also claimed that Trump is increasingly frustrated with the peace process and may abandon it entirely if current efforts fail. The paper suggested that the US leader is eyeing new sanctions against Russia, although no final decision has been made.

The reports come after Trump claimed that Putin “has gone absolutely CRAZY,” rebuking Moscow for firing “missiles and drones… into cities in Ukraine for no reason whatsoever.”

Moscow said its recent strikes targeting Ukrainian military-related facilities were retaliation for a significant increase in Kiev's drone raids into Russia. Russian officials reported near-daily interceptions of over 100 Ukrainian UAVs, suggesting that the strikes are meant to derail the peace process.

Responding to Trump's remarks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that the start of the negotiation process is a “very important moment which is fraught with emotional overload” on all sides. He also stressed that Putin makes decisions “required for the security of our country,” while praising the efforts of the Trump administration to broker an end to the conflict.

US President Donald Trump's plans for a new “Golden Dome” anti-ballistic missile defense system will fuel a nuclear arms race, North Korea has said.

Unveiled by Trump last week, the initiative would provide a multilayered shield against long-range threats to the US. Some interceptor weapons would be deployed in space, and the system would reportedly include the capacity to strike launch sites before a missile is fired. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the project could cost more than $542 billion over a 20-year period.

North Korea reiterated its objections in a memorandum released by the Foreign Ministry's Institute for American Studies, describing the Golden Dome as an inherently offensive system and a “malignant factor” fueling a global strategic arms race. The findings were reported by state media on Tuesday.

The memorandum accused Washington of attempting to militarize space, meaning nations not aligned with the US would be forced to pursue symmetrical nuclear capabilities as their only means of self-defense. It also warned that US “satellite states,” including South Korea and Japan, could be drawn into American military strategy and serve as “cannon fodder” in future conflicts.

The project is “a typical product of ‘America first', the height of self-righteousness, arrogance, high-handed and arbitrary practice, and is an outer space nuclear war scenario supporting the US strategy for uni-polar domination,” the state-run Korean Central News Agency said.

Last week, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said all nations have the sovereign right to develop means of countering perceived threats, when asked specifically about the Golden Dome. However, Moscow has consistently opposed the militarization of space and actions it views as destabilizing to the global strategic balance.

President Vladimir Putin, speaking at his annual press conference last December, underscored Russia's efforts to ensure that its nuclear-capable weapons could defeat all possible countermeasures. He argued that decades of American investment in anti-ballistic missile infrastructure “cost a lot to taxpayers and contribute little to the security for their country.”

EU officials in charge of enforcing Russia sanctions have lamented a major disconnection with Washington, following US President Donald Trump's change in policy towards Moscow.

According to a report by Süddeutsche Zeitung citing an internal document from Germany's Foreign Office, the US and EU have failed to reach an agreement on efforts to counter circumvention of restrictions. Experts have warned the EU/US divide could spell an end to the Russia sanctions regime altogether.

According to the document, the EU's sanctions envoy David O'Sullivan lamented the lack of unity between Brussels and Washington towards anti-Russia restrictions, during a bloc Foreign Affairs Council meeting last week.

Since the Ukraine conflict escalated in 2022, the US and EU have imposed sweeping sanctions to isolate Russia, including bans on seaborne oil, asset freezes, and restrictions targeting the country's economy, trade, and defense sectors.

Recent efforts have focused on alleged sanctions evasion, citing purported attempts by Russia to acquire weapons components through third parties using a so-called “shadow fleet,” a Western term for tankers operating outside recognised insurance systems. The EU has been pushing for additional measures to prevent vessels from operating, including by sanctioning Russia's trade partners, such as China.

According to the report, however, the US does not support Brussels' moves: O'Sullivan at the meeting reportedly acknowledged a total breakdown in coordination with Washington on measures targeting Russia.

“There is no more joint outreach,” he reportedly admitted, adding that G7 cooperation has also “lost momentum.”

US President Donald Trump has threatened tougher sanctions on Russia if negotiations to end the Ukraine conflict fail, without naming any concrete proposals. He has repeatedly noted that he looks forward to boosting trade and economic cooperation with Russia once the conflict is over.

Officials cited in the report believe he is looking to restore business ties sooner rather than later. A recent Bloomberg report citing EU sources also claimed the US has become “unresponsive” in working groups focused on sanctions enforcement.

The next EU sanctions package is expected to target Russia's energy and banking sectors, the report notes, but its approval is now uncertain. Hungary, which has repeatedly opposed sanctions, is reportedly blocking key elements of the proposal. Washington's fading support has further cast doubt on its passage.

German MEP Sergey Lagodinsky told Süddeutsche Zeitung that a full US withdrawal from the sanctions regime would likely bring the entire system to a halt. “The problem is that the US has been the de facto driving force behind the sanctions,” he said.

Moscow has repeatedly denounced Western sanctions as illegal and ineffective, arguing they have failed to destabilize the Russian economy and have instead backfired on the countries that imposed them.

The Trump administration has canceled $100m in contracts as the US president escalates his war on elite universities

US politics live – latest updates

The Donald Trump administration is set to order federal agencies to cancel all government contracts with Harvard University worth an estimated $100m, dramatically escalating the president's assault against America's most prestigious university.

A planned directive first seen by the New York Times set to circulate to agencies on Tuesday instructs officials to terminate existing deals and seek new suppliers, marking what the White House describes as a total break with Harvard after decades of collaboration.

The order comes by way of the General Service Administration (GSA) and affects contracts across nine federal departments, from health research to executive training programs. Agencies must report back by early June on which agreements they plan to axe, according to the letter.

“GSA understands that Harvard continues to engage in race discrimination, including in its admissions process and in other areas of student life,” the letter signed by federal procurement chief Josh Gruenbaum reads. It also claims Harvard has shown a “disturbing lack of concern for the safety and wellbeing of Jewish students”.

It represents the most severe blow yet in Trump's dismantling of Harvard's federal relationships. Since April, the administration has already frozen $3.2bn in research grants and attempted to ban the university from enrolling foreign students – a move temporarily blocked by federal courts.

Harvard's leadership has refused to buckle under federal pressure, with the university's president, Alan Garber, dismissing the administration's demands as “illegal” attempts “to control whom we hire and what we teach”.

The Ivy League institution, which boasts a $53bn endowment, has launched multiple federal lawsuits challenging the funding freeze and student enrollment restrictions. It argues the White House is violating constitutional protections for academic freedom.

The administration also claims Harvard has not complied with a 2023 supreme court decision banning race as a factor in admissions, even though Black enrollment actually dropped at Harvard – from 18% to 14% among first-year students.

“Going forward, we also encourage your agency to seek alternative vendors for future services where you had previously considered Harvard,” the GSA letter adds.

Trump's assault on Harvard began during pro-Palestinian campus demonstrations last year but has since expanded into a broader ideological battle against elite higher education. Trump has repeatedly branded top universities as havens for “Marxist maniacs and lunatics” and on Monday mused that he would redirect their federal funding to trade schools.

Congressional Republicans have backed Trump's university crackdown by approving new taxes on large endowments that could cost Harvard $850m annually, yet the measure still requires Senate approval.

With 6,800 international students making up more than a quarter of its enrollment, Harvard faces an existential threat if Trump succeeds in blocking foreign admissions. Hong Kong universities have already begun recruiting displaced Harvard applicants.

A federal hearing on Thursday will determine whether Harvard's temporary right to enroll international students should be extended. The university continues to challenge the administration's demands in court, including requirements to eliminate diversity programs, cooperate with immigration authorities, and ban face masks apparently targeting pro-Palestinian protesters.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Former gymnast was released after posting bond

Retton won five medals at 1984 Summer Olympics

Olympic gymnastics champion Mary Lou Retton was arrested for DUI earlier this month, according to records on the West Virginia Judiciary website.

The 57-year-old was charged with “driving under influence of alcohol, controlled substances, or drugs” on 17 May after police responded to reports of someone driving a Porsche erratically. According to the records, Retton was slurring her words when police stopped her, and officers saw a container of wine on the passenger seat of her car. She refused to take a breath test, and was released after posting a $1,500 bond.

Retton became a household name in the US after she won five medals at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, including a gold in the all-around competition – the first individual Olympic gymnastics medal ever won by an American – scoring a perfect 10 on the vault in the final rotation. The West Virginia native's performance landed her on the front of Wheaties boxes and keyed the sport's explosion in popularity in the United States.

After her gymnastics career, Retton remained active in the media, appearing in a number of films and TV shows. She was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 1997 and was the first woman to be selected into the Houston Sports Hall of Fame in 2020.

Retton also served on the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under US president George W Bush.

In 2023, she fell seriously ill with pneumonia and was in ICU for a number of weeks. At the time her daughter Kelley said her mother was “fighting for her life” and started a fundraiser to cover medical costs for Retton, who did not have medical insurance. Donations to the fundraiser ended up totaling nearly $500,000. Retton recovered but said she had “faced death in the eyes” during her illness.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Exiled Soviet-era dissident tells the Guardian that for the US to turn its back on the territory would be ‘shameful'

When Mustafa Dzhemilev read the news about Donald Trump's plan for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, he could not believe his eyes. Part of the US administration's peace plan, say recent reports, would involve Washington recognising annexed Crimea as legitimate Russian territory, among other concessions to the Kremlin that Trump hopes might stop Russia's war on Ukraine.

“The whole world knows what happened in Crimea … It would be such a damage to the reputation of the US that it will be hard for them to recover. It would be shameful,” said Dzhemilev, a Soviet-era dissident turned Crimean Tatar political leader, in an interview at his office in Kyiv.

Back in March 2014, during the Russian annexation, Dzhemilev was asked for his public declaration of support for Moscow's takeover by Vladimir Putin himself. The Russian president spoke by telephone to Dzhemilev, promising money and support for the Crimean Tatar community in exchange for his backing. “He explained how we'll be so happy under Russian rule,” Dzhemilev said, recalling the conversation with disdain.

Dzhemilev turned down the deal, saying that after centuries of oppressing the Crimean Tatars, the Russians were unlikely to change, and telling Putin the best thing he could do was remove his troops from the peninsula. A month later, when returning to Crimea from Kyiv, he was stopped at the new Russian frontier and told he was banned from entering. He has lived in exile in Kyiv ever since.

Unlike government officials, who are required to moderate their opinions of the Trump administration for the sake of diplomatic nicety, the 81-year-old Dzhemilev pulls no punches. He talks quietly yet with a sharp turn of phrase and a dark sense of humour, pausing every few minutes to light a fresh cigarette or answer his mobile phone, set to a barking dog ringtone.

“We are in a situation where the head of the US administration, the president, is now a person who feels no emotions, in whose head there is only deal-making … To say the things he says, to say Ukraine shouldn't have started this war. Have they been keeping this man in the dark for the last years? Does he know anything? Has he read anything?”

He recalled an interview with Trump's Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff, who failed to remember the names of all the regions he believed Russia had a reasonable claim to. “That's a diplomat from the United States of America? I've seen a lot of stupid diplomats in my life, but one like him, that's a first,” he said.

This is not Dzhemilev's first exile. In May 1944, when he was six months old, Joseph Stalin had the entire Crimean Tatar population rounded up and deported to Soviet Central Asia on cattle wagons, accusing them of collaboration during the Nazi occupation. Tens of thousands died on the journey.

The Crimean Tatars had been the majority of the population in Crimea until the first Russian annexation, under Catherine the Great in the 18th century. In the intervening years, Russians had begun to dominate, and after Stalin's deportation every single Crimean Tatar was removed.

From exile, Dzhemilev and other dissidents campaigned for a return. He received the first of many jail sentences in 1966 for refusing to do his military service, saying he could not fight in the army of the country that had stolen his homeland.

It was not until 1989 that Crimean Tatars were officially allowed to return, where they found a very different Crimea and a local population that often viewed them as intruders. Many of their houses had been seized and their villages destroyed.

Dzhemilev was elected chair of the Mejlis, the informal parliament of the Crimean Tatars, in 1991. During the early years of Ukrainian rule, Crimean Tatars were often accused of being separatists, wanting their own homeland in Crimea. In the end, they turned out to be some of Ukraine's fiercest defenders in the region. Since the annexation, Russia has launched multiple waves of persecution and arrests against the community, which is estimated to number around 250,000, or about 10% of the population of Crimea.

Many Crimean Tatars have agreed to work with Russian authorities, but Dzhemilev insists that most have done so only under pressure. He conceded, however, that 11 years of Russian rule had made an impact. Children who were in kindergarten at the time of the annexation will soon be old enough to be mobilised into the Russian army, having had a decade of schooling in the Russian curriculum. “Of course, this has an effect on some people's consciousness,” he said.

Still, he believes that many Crimean Tatar families will ensure their children do not lose sight of their history, and is heartened by one of his own earliest memories, as a young schoolboy in 1953, when it was announced on the radio that Stalin had died. “Everyone was crying, but not the Crimean Tatars. The first thing my dad said was, ‘Finally, the dog has kicked it',” he remembered. A relative came by with some onions, in case crying on demand was required.

Dzhemilev spent a total of 15 years in prisons and camps during the Soviet period, after seven different court cases. “The biggest single sentence I got was three years. By today's Russian standards I guess they would have shot me 10 times. They are destroying the lives of people by giving them 17 or 20 years for some small thing that was overheard,” he said.

There was a moment, in late 2022 and 2023, when Ukraine's army was on the offensive against the Russians and anything seemed possible, including Kyiv winning back Crimea. Dzhemilev recalled how, at the end of 2023, the head of Ukraine's military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, came to visit him, suggesting he record a New Year's Eve address that Ukrainian hackers could show on television channels in Crimea, replacing Putin's. In the address, Dzhemilev announced that 2024 would be the final year of Russian rule and advised recent arrivals to return to Russia.

That did not happen. “It seems the liberation of Crimea has been postponed,” he conceded. If the US does recognise Crimea, Dzhemilev hopes international leaders will put some kind of pressure on Russia to give guarantees to the Crimean Tatars.

He has called on Turkey to push for the creation of an international monitoring group to work in Crimea, and for members of the Mejlis to be given the freedom to travel to Crimea with immunity from prosecution under Russian law. He was due to meet President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at a diplomatic forum in Antalya in April to put the request to him in person.

The pair have met several times before, but this time Erdoğan cancelled the meeting, citing a packed schedule, and sent a deputy instead, Dzhemilev said: “One of his aides said to me that it wasn't really about time, it was because this is a person who likes to be able to fulfil people's requests. And he knew more or less what I was going to ask, and he knows he won't be able to fulfil it.”

Dzhemilev's biography has a sad symmetry to it: decades of exile culminating in a return home, only for another exile to begin. He dismissed any personal hardship, noting that his years in the gulag had made him accustomed to being far from home. “Personally, I am quite comfortable, I have no complaints. But the fact that our people fought to return home after the 1944 deportation for half a century and now are once again in a forced deportation, that is quite awful,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

President William Lai (賴清德) yesterday called on the European Parliament to support the signing of an economic partnership agreement (EPA) between Taiwan and the EU, citing the potential for enhanced economic security.

An EPA would “not only yield mutually beneficial win-win developments, but also consolidate economic security and boost international competitiveness on both sides,” Lai said during a meeting in Taipei with European Parliament members Reinis Poznaks and Beatrice Timgren.

Highlighting a strong complementarity between Taiwan and the EU in areas such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence and green energy, Lai said that through “our joint efforts, we can create more resilient democratic supply chains, and further contribute to global prosperity and development.”

Taiwan has been calling for an economic deal with the EU since the tenure of Lai's predecessor, former president Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), underscoring Taipei's desire to deepen economic and trade ties with Europe.

While the European Parliament has voiced support for negotiating an EPA with Taiwan, the European Commission has remained hesitant on the issue.

During the meeting at the Presidential Office, Lai also thanked the European Parliament for resolutions reaffirming support for Taiwan amid ongoing “provocative military actions” from China, and for recognizing Taiwan as a key democratic partner in the Indo-Pacific region.

Poznaks, reflecting on his home nation Latvia's own experience with its “large, aggressive neighbor,” expressed solidarity with Taiwan and stressed the importance of democracies uniting to defend the rule of law.

Seeing China and Russia as using the same playbook through disinformation attacks, Poznaks said it was “crucial for all democracies around the world to stick together and protect our freedoms, values and democracy.”

Timgren echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing the importance of close ties between democratic nations in the face of authoritarian threats, adding that such a demonstration of unity would be “part of [our] defense.”

During their visit from Sunday to Friday, the parliamentarians are also scheduled to meet with Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍), as well as representatives from the legislature, civil society groups and think tanks, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.

Separately yesterday, Lai also urged more cooperation beyond Europe during a separate meeting with a delegation led by Guam Governor Lourdes Leon Guerrero, who is on a seven-day visit to Taiwan this week.

“The world is rapidly changing and tensions in the Indo-Pacific continue to rise, but if we combine our strengths, come together as one and enhance cooperation, we can maintain peace, stability and prosperity in our region,” Lai said.

He added that Taiwan looked forward to working with Guam and the US to further strengthen economic ties and explore more opportunities for industrial cooperation.


GAINING STEAM: 
                                        The scheme initially failed to gather much attention, with only 188 cards issued in its first year, but gained popularity amid the COVID-19 pandemic                                        Applications for the Employment Gold Card have increased in the past few years, with the card having been issued to a total of 13,191 people from 101 countries since its introduction in 2018, the National Development Council (NDC) said yesterday.
Those who have received the card have included celebrities, such as former NBA star Dwight Howard and Australian-South Korean cheerleader Dahye Lee, the NDC said. 
The four-in-one Employment Gold Card combines a work permit, resident visa, Alien Resident Certificate (ARC) and re-entry permit. It was first introduced in February 2018 through the Act Governing Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professionals (外國專業人才延攬及雇用法),                                    


WARNING:
                                        From Jan. 1 last year to the end of last month, 89 Taiwanese have gone missing or been detained in China, the MAC said, urging people to carefully consider travel to China                                        Lax enforcement had made virtually moot regulations banning civil servants from making unauthorized visits to China, the Control Yuan said yesterday.
Several agencies allowed personnel to travel to China after they submitted explanations for the trip written using artificial intelligence or provided no reason at all, the Control Yuan said in a statement, following an investigation headed by Control Yuan member Lin Wen-cheng (林文程).
The probe identified 318 civil servants who traveled to China without permission in the past 10 years, but the true number could be close to 1,000, the Control Yuan said.

The nation last year acquired the Swiss-owned vessel, formerly known as Turanor PlanetSolar, in a bid to boost Taiwan's technology sector, as well as ecotourism in Palau, Chen said at the ship's launch ceremony at Singda Harbor.
Palauan President Surangel Whipps Jr and Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍) also attended the event.
The original vessel was the first solar-powered ship to circumnavigate the globe in a voyage from 2010 to 2012.

ENHANCE DETERRENCE:

Calin Georgescu, a Moscow-friendly Romanian politician who ran for president in November 2024, announced on May 26 that he is retiring from politics.

In a video address posted online, Georgescu said he had made a personal choice to become a mere ""observer of public and social life"" and devote more time and energy to his family.

An ultranationalist and a staunch opponent of NATO, Georgescu came first in the initial round of the presidential election in November 2024 with 22.9% of the vote. Romania's Constitutional Court later annulled the vote due to credible evidence of foreign interference in Georgescu's favor, namely from Russia.

Georgescu was later barred from participating in a rerun in May as he faces multiple criminal charges over suspected promotion of fascist ideologies and Romania's World War II-era leader, Ion Antonescu, who oversaw the Holocaust in the country.

In his address, Georgescu said that after the presidential election, ""this stage of the sovereignist movement has ended."" He added he would not join any political party or seek to hold a political office.

After Georgescu was banned from running for president, far-right Eurosceptic George Simion became the leading nationalist candidate instead but was defeated in the runoff on May 18 by pro-EU centrist Nicusor Dan.

""The world is weary of conflict, war, haste, violence, and political excess,"" Georgescu said.

""When public attention is consumed by political infighting that has little to do with society's well-being, those in professions vital to the country's welfare are pushed to the margins.""

Georgescu thanked all those who supported him, claiming they had been ""harassed, humiliated, and marginalized,"" and extended his gratitude also to his opponents.

The largely unknown Georgescu surged in popularity shortly before the November vote thanks to what is suspected to be Russian interference and a hybrid campaign on the TikTok platform.

The former candidate has vowed to end Romania's assistance to Ukraine and once suggested that Bucharest could take part in the country's post-war partition, drawing a rebuke from Kyiv.


          We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war —
          and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information

Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds.EMAL COUNTESS/GETTY IMAGES

Try, try again

He might be one of the world's most successful actors, but 48-year-old Reynolds has starred in plenty of dogs (see No. 2). Critics absolutely pan you? Shake it off, move on—and joke about it later. 

You can't spend your way to success

Green Lantern is generally regarded as the worst comic-book adaptation ever. But Reynolds learned some valuable lessons from his painful Hal Jordan experience: “Too much money and too much time wrecks creativity,” he has said. “And constraint is the greatest creative tool you can possibly have.” No amount of cash can save a poorly conceived idea.

Never settle

Reynolds started developing Deadpool in 2004. Due largely to studio shenanigans, he was forced to debut the character in the 2009 X-Men Origins: Wolverine but hated the portrayal that was foisted on him. So did fans. He persevered until he won absolute creative freedom, and the first foul-mouthed, critically acclaimed Deadpool film, released in 2016, grossed US$782 million worldwide. Its two sequels grossed even more, and the third installment is the highest-grossing R-rated film ever. 

Marketing is everything

Reynolds is no silent partner. He often becomes the quirky, hilarious spokesman for many of his investments, including Mint Mobile. Five years after he accrued a 25% stake, T-Mobile bought it for US$1.4 billion. He bought a majority stake in Aviation Gin in 2016; Diageo acquired the brand four years later for US$610 million, based largely on his genius as creative director. Since he took over Wrexham AFC in 2020—and created a hit docuseries about his and Rob McElhenney's adventures in Wales—tourism earnings in the town have tripled. Oh, and the team just won a third straight promotion. Next up: reversing the fortunes of Alpine, currently ranked No. 9 in F1.

Give back

The prolific philanthropist most notably uses his star power to raise money for Toronto's SickKids Hospital. And as SickKids Foundation CEO Jennifer Bernard told us, for Reynolds, it really is all about the kids. “He came for a visit on my second day... No security, regular street clothes. Drove up, went through a side door. And we always send our stars a package on the kids. He knew every kid's name. He knew their story, he knew their parents... Ryan, honestly, is a national treasure.”

I love my job and my direct manager but I hate my boss, who is the owner of the company. He's rude, brash and dismissive. I dread our weekly company-wide meetings. About once a month, I'll get assigned a task that requires one-on-one meetings with him, which is anxiety-inducing and stressful. I don't want to leave my job, but what are some strategies I can use to cope with being around the company owner? How can I tactfully request that my manager not put me on tasks that involve time with the owner?

Jivi Saran, executive business adviser, Quantum Business Growth, Vancouver

In a values and purpose-based workplace culture, we understand that every interaction – even the challenging ones – offers valuable insight into how we relate, communicate and influence one another. Your stress around the company owner is completely valid and rather than seeing it solely as a problem, it can be viewed as a meaningful signal – an opportunity to reflect on your boundaries, needs and energy. 

Rather than approaching this situation with avoidance, consider shifting how you prepare for and engage in these moments. Before your meetings, ground yourself – take a few deep breaths, remind yourself of what you bring to the table and set a clear intention to remain steady and composed. This helps you stay aligned with your values, regardless of someone else's behaviour.

When it comes to speaking with your manager, approach the conversation with honesty and professionalism. You might say something like: “I work best in calm, collaborative settings. I find it difficult to stay focused and confident when I work directly with [the owner] and it impacts my ability to deliver my best. Would it be possible to adjust how these tasks are assigned so I can continue contributing effectively?” This isn't about avoiding responsibility – it's about making intentional choices that support your well-being and performance. We know that when we make even small adjustments to how we show up, the environment often begins to shift in response.

You don't have to give up a role you care about. With clear communication and a centred mindset, you can create more peace within yourself while continuing to make a meaningful contribution. Empowerment doesn't always require dramatic action – sometimes, it comes from quiet self-awareness and conscious choices about where your energy goes.

Bruce Sandy, principal, Pathfinder Coaching & Consulting, Nanoose Bay, B.C. 

I am curious why you hate your boss/the owner of the company. There are a number of rude, brash and dismissive people in the world. Do you feel as strongly about them? How do you handle them? 

Your boss may remind you of other key figures, which may be causing your amplified reactions to him. Reflect on who that may be. If you have unresolved abuse (and/or) trauma caused by someone similar to your boss in your past, then you will want to consider speaking to a therapist or counsellor about this.

Ask your direct manager if it is possible not to have direct contact with the owner. Be curious about how this avoidance of dealing with the owner may impact you in your job and the workplace. If it is not possible to avoid contact with the owner, then ask your direct manager about how best to work with the owner. 

Does your boss/owner have any redeeming qualities that you appreciate? If so, list these and focus on them. Remember, that which you focus on grows.

If you cannot avoid the owner, then be professional, respectful and set clear boundaries with him. Indicate to the owner that you want to focus on the issue at hand and that you have a set amount of time for the meeting. Also, ask if he has any constructive feedback for you at the end of meetings. You may want to have your direct manager or someone else involved in the meetings until you become comfortable interacting with the owner by yourself. They can then provide you with feedback, recommendations and coaching on how best to work with the owner.

Germany's Foreign Ministry has dismissed Uganda's accusations that the German ambassador to Kampala was involved in ""subversive activities."" Uganda's armed forces said they had suspended military cooperation with Berlin.

The German Foreign Ministry on Monday dismissed Uganda's accusations that Berlin's ambassador, Mathias Schauer, had been involved in illicit meddling in the East African country's affairs.

A ministry spokesperson said that Berlin ""strongly condemned"" the allegations, describing them as ""absurd"" and ""baseless.""

In an X post published on Sunday, Ugandan military spokesperson Chris Magezi said that Kampala had received ""credible intelligence reports"" that the German ambassador had been ""actively engaged in subversive activities"" in Uganda.

He said that Uganda's army would suspend all cooperation with Germany.

""The Uganda People's Defence Forces has with immediate effect suspended all ongoing defence and military cooperation activities with the Federal Republic of Germany,"" Magezi said.

Ugandan troops participate in an African Union peacekeeping force in Somalia, a mission partially funded by the European Union.

Earlier in the month, Ugandan military chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba warned that the EU was ""playing with fire"" after a group of European diplomats met senior members of the National Unity Platform (NUP) opposition party, including leader Bobi Wine.

Kainerugaba is the son of President Yoweri Museveni and is likely to succeed the 80-year-old strongman, who has been in power since 1986.

Wine, who was a popular musician before launching his political career, has been put under house arrest by Ugandan authorities multiple times.

Another major Ugandan opposition figure, Kizza Besigye of the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC), was jailed in November.

Last August, 36 FDC members were charged with terrorism, an accusation rights groups argued was politically motivated.

Uganda has also been criticized by Western governments and rights groups for a 2023 law imposing penalties of up to life in prison for consensual same-sex relations and containing provisions allowing the death penalty for ""aggravated homosexuality.""

A report of an antisemitic incident at a high school in central Germany last week coincided with the arrest of teenage right-wing extremists. Are deeply right-wing extremist views resonating with more and more youth?

Ideally, a graduation motto is a phrase one fondly remembers for a lifetime. It decorates the senior class' T-shirts, serves as inspiration for numerous graduation parties and is the title of the graduation newspaper, marking the ceremonial end of school life for 18- and 19-year-olds.

For some students at the Liebig School in the town of Giessen in central Germany, however, the whole topic of picking a graduation motto is now something they would rather quickly forget. Or, as student representative Nicole Kracke told German news magazine, Der Spiegel: ""We're now the ones with the Nazi label. That hurts.""

'Abi macht frei' (a reference to the infamous 'Arbeit macht frei' signs above the gates of Nazi extermination camps), and 'NSDABI — Burn the Duden' (referring to the Nazi party NSDAP, Nazi book burnings and Jewish persecution) were among the proposals in an anonymous online vote for the 2026 graduation motto.

Some students reacted immediately and reported the incident to the school administration. Access to the portal was deleted, the entire graduating class was summoned and a prepared statement was presented to them: 'In our school community, there is no place for racism, antisemitism or discrimination. We stand together against it!'

The police are now investigating on suspicion of incitement to hatred.

Was the incident just a provocation, a lapse by a few immature high school graduates, or a silly prank? Or was it, perhaps, the ultimate proof of how deeply right-wing extremist views are resonating with more and more young people in Germany?

The Nazi slogans proposed as a graduation motto caused such an uproar that the new education minister, Karin Prien, of the center-right Christian Democratic Union party (CDU), called for mandatory visits to concentration camp memorials for all students in Germany.

The motto comes after several recent antisemitic incidents involving students. In April, front of the Auschwitz extermination camp, where the National Socialists murdered over a million people, ninth-grade students from Görlitz, Saxony, displayed a neo-Nazi salute. Also last month, a secondary school teacher at a school in Oelsnitz, Saxony, requested a transfer after being threatened by far-right students. And in February 2024, at a school in Wiesbaden, Hesse, students applauded during an educational film about the murder of millions of Jews.

Tina Dürr was therefore not particularly surprised when she learned about the incident in Giessen. She is the deputy director of the Democracy Center Hesse, which assists and advises schools, municipalities and organizations in the fight against right-wing extremism.

""Provocations and right-wing extremist statements, such as this graduation motto, have generally increased in schools — we receive more and more reports about it,"" she told DW. ""There are swastikas and right-wing extremist graffiti, Hitler salutes, racist or right-wing extremist songs being sung on school trips.""

The federal states do not have a uniform way of recording far-right hate crimes in schools, but a survey conducted by the German weekly Die Zeit among German state ministries revealed a worrying picture: In 2024, right-wing extremist incidents increased by at least 30%, compared with the previous year.

In German society, such positions and provocations are becoming more acceptable, and Dürr has explored the ways in which young people are being engaged. 

""Young men are being deliberately drawn into pre-political activities through martial arts, in order to recruit them for nationalist ideas and toxic masculinity ideals,"" she said.

On social media, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) particularly focuses on the issue of misogyny. ""The devaluation of women and a return to a traditionally conservative gender role model — both elements of right-wing extremism — are experiencing a resurgence. Confident women are devalued, queer people are devalued, leading up to acts of violence and femicide,"" explained Dürr.

Above all, this has presented an enormous challenge for teachers. Two years ago,a case in Brandenburg drew national attention when two teachers publicly exposed right-wing extremist incidents at their school. They were subsequently subjected to massive hostility — and ultimately left the school in frustration.

A response from teachers is more necessary now than ever, said Dürr — otherwise far-right and racist provocations could become socially acceptable. ""If right-wing extremist incidents are not addressed and the perpetrators are allowed to act unchecked, it sends a subtle message to students that such behaviour is normal,"" she said. ""We must support those who have the courage to stand up for democratic values, and who identify extremism as a problem.""

Stefan Düll knows this issue all too well from personal experience. The head of the German Teachers' Association is also the principal of a high school in Neusäss, Bavaria. He has called for the toughest possible response to right-wing extremist misconduct by students, involving the police, filing charges and emphasizing that public officials are legally obligated to take action.

""We cannot sweep crimes under the carpet and say, 'We'll just handle this with a personal discussion, and that will be enough.' Even if the perpetrator is only 13 years old, we must report it to the police. And when the police visit the perpetrator and issue a formal warning, it carries a different weight than school disciplinary measures, which must also be imposed,"" he told DW.

Düll supports the Federal Education Ministry's plan to make visits to concentration camp memorials mandatory — 90% of schools already do this. However, educational institutions are finding it increasingly difficult to keep the memory of the Holocaust alive, he said.

According to a study by the Jewish Claims Conference, some 40% of surveyed Germans aged 18 to 29 did not know that approximately 6 million Jewish men and women were murdered during the Nazi era. Eyewitnesses who visit schools, such as the recently deceased Margot Friedländer, will soon no longer be around. And as time passes, the historical distance grows: students live in the here and now, Düll explained.

""Right-wing extremist incidents in schools are increasing because the direct connection, even through one's own family, is no longer present,"" said Düll. ""We also have students whose families have no connection to the history of Nazi Germany because they did not live in Germany during that time.""

Trump is dangerously underfunding FEMA, leaving states that rely on it unprepared in the face of upcoming severe storms.

Trump is dangerously underfunding FEMA, leaving states that rely on it unprepared in the face of upcoming severe storms.

With the official start of hurricane season less than a week away, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is facing a storm of its own.

Donald Trump's administration has begun gutting the agency, slashing budgets and cutting staff. The president has made clear from the start of his term that he wants to shift the financial burden for disaster relief from the federal government to states — the same vision outlined in the far right Project 2025 playbook — if not eliminate FEMA entirely, as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has pledged. While emergency management experts agree that states should play a role in funding their disaster relief efforts, recent government leaks have raised concerns that the Trump administration is leaving FEMA dangerously underfunded — and leaving the states that rely on it unprepared in the face of upcoming severe storms.

In a May budget draft, Trump proposed slashing FEMA grants by $646 million, even as the agency is projected to run out of disaster relief money by this summer for the third consecutive year. The administration also canceled a grant program called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, which funds community-level emergency preparedness efforts. The popular program had enjoyed bipartisan support.

In internal meetings, newly appointed FEMA head David Richardson admitted himself that the agency isn't ready for hurricane season. Like many of the efforts undertaken by the Trump administration this term, FEMA's transition to a “smaller footprint” has been hasty and disorganized. An internal review found that understaffing and other issues had derailed FEMA's usual processes for hurricane season preparedness. The agency is also scrambling as it adjusts to new leadership after the Trump administration fired acting FEMA head Cameron Hamilton earlier this month. The sudden firing was in response to Hamilton's public testimony at a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing, during which he said he does not “believe it is in the best interests of the American people to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency.” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later told reporters that Hamilton had been dismissed because he said “something that was contrary to what the president believes.”

Scientists say that warming ocean temperatures are causing more intense and destructive hurricanes. And many months later, states are still reeling from last year's devastating season: In North Carolina, where Hurricane Helene killed at least 100 people last September and caused nearly $60 billion in damage, residents and town leaders are still waiting for disbursements of federal funds. Data released this month by North Carolina's Office of State Budget Management found that $5.95 billion has been allocated by federal and state governments for Helene recovery — only about 10 percent of the total amount needed to rebuild homes and public infrastructure. But just because money has been earmarked doesn't mean it's been disbursed. “The money is there,” Zeb Smathers, the mayor of Canton, North Carolina, told The Charlotte Observer. “It's the will to act. I'm very tired of excuses.”

In April, FEMA denied North Carolina's request for the federal government to continue matching 100 percent of the state's spending on Helene debris removal for another six months. “The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said in a statement. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA's bad decision, even for 90 days. Six months later, the people of western North Carolina are working hard to get back on their feet; they need FEMA to help them get the job done.”

It's clear that FEMA needs reforms. Bureaucratic red tape and procedural lags have left vulnerable people in limbo. Ironically, as the Trump administration has preached streamlining the agency, a memo obtained by southwest Virginia outlet Cardinal News outlined new, additional “manual review processes” implemented by FEMA that were slowing Helene recovery efforts in the region. John Scrivani, the acting state coordinator of the Virginia Department of Emergency Management (VDEM) wrote to local emergency managers on April 11, that FEMA had provided “revised guidance” on how documentation should be submitted for grant programs. After submitting the requested documentation, Scrivani wrote, VDEM still had not received feedback from FEMA, leaving the state agency without guidance as it awaited payment for a range of disaster reimbursements and emergency preparedness funds — seven months after the storm.

“Unfortunately, at this time, we do not have an update as to when and if these funds will be made available,” wrote Scrivani. “We are asking for your patience and understanding as we navigate this together.”

In a statement to Cardinal News, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Virginia) voiced his opposition to the new procedures, noting that allocated federal funds had already undergone a thorough review process. “FEMA and DHS's announcement to conduct additional reviews of grants, including for emergency management and disaster assistance, is ridiculous. These communities need funding as soon as possible, and the Trump Administration is unnecessarily making it harder for these communities to rebuild,” said Kaine.

Similarly, in North Carolina, state lawmakers are wrangling over what to do as they await clarity on federal relief funds. “The continual line from the Republicans in the North Carolina legislature is ‘Well, we got to wait and see what the feds are going to do,'” North Carolina Rep. Eric Ager told The Assembly. “We've been doing that for six months now, right? And it's still not completely clear what the feds are gonna pay for and what they're not.”

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

Officers are arresting people after hearings and putting them into expedited proceedings that do not require a judge.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested 11 people after their court hearings at the San Diego Immigration Court on Thursday as part of a nationwide operation launched this week to try to fast track deportations.

Beginning Tuesday in courts including those in Santa Ana and Las Vegas, attorneys representing the U.S. government — who are also employed by ICE — requested that immigration judges close cases of some people who had been in the U.S. for less than two years and who had shown up without attorneys. Normally a closed immigration court case would mean that the government is no longer trying to deport someone. But instead, ICE officers waited outside courtrooms to arrest those people and put them into expedited proceedings that do not require a judge.

“Going to immigration court is your chance to be heard,” said Michelle Celleri, an attorney and legal rights director of Alliance San Diego. “It is your right. It is part of due process.”

Celleri said that arresting people who show up for their hearings would discourage others from coming to immigration courts. 

ICE and the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which runs the immigration court, did not respond to requests for comment from Beyond the Border. ICE has told other news outlets that it is detaining people who are subject to a fast-track deportation authority.

That fast-track deportation process is called expedited removal. 

In expedited removal, an immigration officer, rather than a judge, gives the deportation order. In an executive order issued in January, President Donald Trump called for officers to use the process on anyone who has been in the U.S. for less than two years.

“With expedited removal, they can deport them tonight,” said Ginger Jacobs, a private immigration attorney in San Diego. “They're short-cutting the due process these folks came here to receive in immigration court.”

But not everyone detained in San Diego on Thursday had closed cases. ICE arrested several people who had received future hearings dates from the immigration judges they appeared before, according to their attorneys and friends.

Ruth, a volunteer with the grassroots group Detention Resistance who asked not to be fully identified because of concerns about potential retaliation, said she had accompanied her friend, a man from Colombia who has been in the U.S. for just under a year, to court Thursday morning. 

She said that when her friend left the courtroom to go to the bathroom, officers tried to detain him even though his hearing hadn't happened yet. During his hearing, Ruth's friend told the judge that he was afraid of being arrested when he went back outside the courtroom. 

The judge told her friend that he wasn't affiliated with ICE and couldn't control what they did, Ruth said. Her friend turned in his asylum application, and the judge gave him another hearing date. 

When her friend left his hearing, ICE officers took him into custody.

“He came in good faith keeping with his asylum process,” Ruth said. “Now we don't even know what's going to happen to him.”

Ruth said her friend has been active in the San Diego community and getting involved as a volunteer to help others in need.

Tracy Crowley, an immigration attorney with Immigrant Defenders Law Center, took on Ruth's friend's case as he was being detained. She said she was still trying to figure out the legal reason for taking him into custody.

“It's wild,” Crowley said. “The warrants are very bareboned and don't include the legal basis for detaining them.”

Crowley was among a group of lawyers who jumped in to try to represent people in their court proceedings throughout the day in an effort to avoid additional arrests. 

Jacobs, the private immigration attorney, said her office took on four cases Thursday, including that of a young woman from Turkey who seemed terrified by the officers' presence.

In the afternoon, Jacobs helped a mother and her teenage son, quickly getting to know them in the courtroom in the moments before the hearing began. Outside in the hallway, more than 10 officers waited. ICE also called in two private security guards and two Federal Protective Services officers because of the presence of journalists, attorneys and community members documenting their actions in the hallway.

After the family left the courtroom, ICE appeared to follow them to try to detain them. Jacobs followed after the officers, and she said that ICE decided to let the family go.

Jacobs said ICE let the family go because the son had accompanied his mother.

ICE officers in San Diego mistakenly attempted to arrest two additional people Thursday. The officers later acknowledged the error.

In one case, an attorney from the American Bar Association Immigration Justice Project accompanied his client out of the courtroom. When ICE moved to arrest the client, the attorney objected, asking to see a warrant.

Officers shoved themselves between the attorney and his client. Two officers took hold of the man and he ended up on the ground. Beyond the Border witnessed him begin to gasp for air and hyperventilate. The attorney asked to be allowed to help his client, but ICE officers kept him away.

“May I please see a warrant because the warrant you provided is not that person,” the attorney said after ICE showed him their documentation. “You are making an unlawful arrest.”

ICE continued to keep him away from his client, saying that the man was having a medical emergency. 

“He's having a medical emergency thanks to you,” the attorney replied. 

Another attorney in the hallway called for an ambulance, and eventually ICE backed away from the man. The attorney helped his client down the hallway to the elevator, holding the man's arm over his shoulders to support his weight so that he could move away from the officers.

“I will help my client at this point,” the attorney said as they left. “You guys have done enough.”

Several people who had accompanied family members to their hearings were left in the hallway in tears as they watched loved ones being taken away. Celleri worried about family members who weren't there and would have no way of knowing what had happened.

“For those who are unrepresented, to their family they have just disappeared, and they are not going to know where they are for 48 hours — and that's if they know how to find them,” Celleri said.

Officers told attorneys in the hallway that those arrested on Thursday would be taken to Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego.

Lindsay Toczylowski, an attorney and CEO of Immigrant Defenders Law Center who was among the first to publicly call attention to the ICE operation, called the arrests a bait and switch.

“By detaining people in courtrooms, we are discouraging people from doing what we have always asked them to do,” Toczylowski said. “We have always stressed how important it is for people to show up to court, to avail themselves of the system to follow the rules that are set out.”

She said courts in Santa Ana, Chicago, Phoenix and Miami also saw arrests this week.

Celleri said people with upcoming hearings should know that if they don't come to court, they will likely be ordered deported in their absence. 

She said that if ICE attempts to arrest someone, that person should make sure the officers have the correct name and that if that person has already paid bond to get out of immigration custody, the person should not be detained again.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:truthout.org","NPR Sues Trump Admin for “Unlawful” Executive Order Mandating Funding Cuts","https://truthout.org/articles/npr-sues-trump-admin-for-unlawful-executive-order-mandating-funding-cuts/","Tue, 27 May 2025 15:55:11 GMT","

The lawsuit described the order as a retaliatory infringement of First Amendment rights.

NPR sued U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday over his recent executive order aiming to end federal funding for the outlet, a move that the lawsuit calls an illegal attack that “threatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information.”

Colorado Public Radio, KSUT Public Radio, and Roaring Fork Public Radio joined NPR in filing the legal challenge, which also names White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

“The order is unlawful in multiple ways,” the lawsuit states. “It flatly contravenes statutes duly enacted by Congress and violates the Separation of Powers and the Spending Clause by disregarding Congress' express commands. It also violates the First Amendment's guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press.”

“The order aims to punish NPR for the content of news and other programming the president dislikes and chill the exercise of First Amendment rights by NPR and individual public radio stations across the country,” the suit continues. “The order is textbook retaliation and viewpoint-based discrimination in violation of the First Amendment.”

Trump's May 1 executive order instructed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which is funded by Congress, to end both direct and indirect funding to NPR and PBS, accusing the outlets of “biased and partisan news coverage.”

The lawsuit demands court action barring the Trump administration from implementing the president's order.

Roughly 1% of NPR's funding comes directly from the federal government, and its member stations across the U.S. receive around 10% of their funds from the CPB. NPR says more than 43 million Americans consume its articles, podcasts, and other content on a weekly basis.

Katherine Maher, NPR's president and CEO, said in a statement Tuesday that Trump's order “is a clear violation of the Constitution and the First Amendment's protections for freedom of speech and association, and freedom of the press.”

“The Supreme Court has ruled numerous times over the past 80 years that the government does not have the right to determine what counts as ‘biased,'” said Maher. “NPR will never agree to this infringement of our constitutional rights, or the constitutional rights of our member stations, and NPR will not compromise our commitment to an independent free press and journalistic integrity.”

Press freedom organizations have issued dire warnings about the consequences of federal funding cuts for NPR and PBS, arguing they could result in the closure of hundreds of local radio and television stations nationwide.

“The harm of these cuts will disproportionately befall rural American communities,” a coalition of advocacy groups wrote in a letter to congressional leaders last month. “Less densely populated parts of the country tend to have fewer options for reliable news sources. These markets are often less viable for commercial media, making it unlikely that the gap left by shuttered public media stations will be adequately filled.”

Following its passage by the House in the early morning hours of May 22, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act—the vehicle to fund and implement President Donald Trump's agenda—is now in the process of being evaluated by the Senate.

Aside from these well-known components of the legislation, several lesser-known—but impactful—provisions were also slipped into the bill, which leaves few areas of government and the federal budget untouched.

The text of the bill reads, “no State or political subdivision thereof may enforce any law or regulation regulating artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence systems, or automated decision systems during the 10-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act.”

Despite several hearings on the topic over the past several years, Congress has until now made little legislative progress on the growing issue.

This provision could be unpopular with tech industry chiefs—who have in the past warned of the need for regulation, expressing fears that the technology could escape human control—as well as senators who have investigated the issue.

Specifically, the bill would require plaintiffs to provide a bond before a judge could enforce contempt orders. Under current federal court procedures, this fee can be waived depending on the nature of the case.

It would allow beneficiaries to withdraw $500 a year to pay for such expenses, or $1,000 for married couples, albeit with a laundry list of rules about what types of physical activity qualify.

For example, eligible facilities cannot be “a private club owned and operated by its members,” and cannot offer “golf, hunting, sailing, or riding facilities.” Other materials, such as videos and books related to personal fitness, are not eligible for HSA account funds under the bill.

It's a change that could result in less than 0.1 percent of estates being subject to federal estate tax, by some estimates.

As part of a push to end the dominance of services like TurboTax and H&R Block—which tend to charge most taxpayers money for specialized services—the Biden administration created “Direct File.” It sought to save taxpayers money by allowing them to access the same services usually offered for a fee by tax prep companies, and is currently available in 25 states.

The bill would repeal this program entirely, requiring that it be terminated within 30 days of the bill's passage.

It would allow taxpayers to contribute up to $5,000 a year to the accounts, which would be allowed to grow tax-free until the beneficiary withdraws the money at 18 years or older.

The withdrawal would then be subject to either capital gains or income tax rates, depending on the nature of the expense.

Under current law, tobacco companies pay an excise tax when they manufacture or import tobacco into the United States. But a loophole in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 has historically allowed them to recoup much of this excise tax through a process known as substitution drawback.

An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, §501(p)—passed as part of the PATRIOT Act—sought to crack down on nonprofits that funneled money to, or otherwise materially aided and abetted, terrorist groups.

The legislation would give organizations deemed to be “terrorist-supporting” 90 days to amend the situation or face revocation of their tax-exempt status.

Currently, such attachments—designed to reduce the sound a firearm makes when fired—are subject to a $200 excise tax. The Republican bill would eliminate that fee altogether.

The move was immediately celebrated by gun rights groups, who portrayed it as a victory for the Second Amendment. Proponents say these attachments can also reduce hearing damage from firearm sounds, while opponents say that such attachments primarily serve to hide evidence of crimes.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

During his trip to the Middle East in mid-May, U.S. President Donald Trump did something extraordinary. On the Saudi leg of his four-day tour, the president issued a sweeping change to U.S. policy toward Syria. First, he announced, to riotous applause in Riyadh, that the United States would suspend all sanctions on the country as the Syrian government navigates a difficult transition following the collapse of the Bashar al-Assad regime in December. The following day, Trump met publicly with Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Shara, a former al-Qaeda fighter who just months ago had a $10 million U.S. government bounty on his head. After the meeting, Trump referred to Shara as a young, attractive guy with a “strong past.”

In taking these abrupt steps, Trump skirted what in any other U.S. administration would likely have been a long and tedious policymaking process. For months, many Syrians and Syria watchers had worried that the United States might never lift its sanctions. Washington first imposed sanctions on Syria in 1979, when it declared its regime to be a state sponsor of terrorism, triggering a ban on arms sales and other restrictions on exports to the country. Congress imposed additional sanctions in the early years of the twenty-first century. After Syria's civil war began in 2011, both the United States and Europe added further restrictions. Armed groups within Syria—some of which are now represented in the government in Damascus—were also issued terrorist designations and therefore remain subject to sanctions. Together, these measures largely cut Syria off from international trade and investment and have been a major barrier to economic recovery in the war-ravaged country.

Syria's need is urgent. More than 90 percent of Syrians live below the poverty line, and 70 percent require humanitarian aid to meet basic needs. At the current rate of growth, it would take Syria's economy until at least 2080 to reach the GDP it had before the civil war began in 2011. Dire economic conditions are worsened by the communal violence and sectarian tensions that have flared since the fall of the Assad regime, which was dominated by the Alawite minority, and the seizure of the capital predominantly by Shara's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a Sunni-affiliated former rebel group. Shara has promised to protect Syria's minorities, but some members of the Alawite, Druze, and other communities are not convinced. External interference, including from Israel, which has launched over 700 strikes on Syria and seized territory within the country, has deepened the country's instability. All these pressures are now mounting. Days after Trump's announcement, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the decision to lift sanctions came after U.S. officials concluded that that Syria's transitional government could be “weeks, not many months, away from potential collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions.”

Trump's unexpected pivot on sanctions was the right thing to do, and it could help Syria address its current challenges. The toppling of the brutal Assad regime opened the door to a better future for Syrians and for the region. But removing sanctions was never going to be enough to pull the country away from the brink. Beginning to lift U.S. sanctions is an important first step—one that has been amplified by the European Union's decision to lift most of its own sanctions on Syria—to create favorable conditions for the foreign investment Syria desperately needs. The United States and Syria's other partners now need to clear the remaining obstacles to stability and economic recovery, and do so quickly—rather than let internal pressures and regional rivalries cause the country to unravel.

The Trump administration has already taken some steps to fulfill the president's promise to remove sanctions. Last week, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control issued a license that immediately lifts most U.S. sanctions, including those on Shara himself, although it does not remove foreign terrorism designations and can be rescinded at any time. On the same day, the State Department issued a 180-day waiver of sanctions imposed under the 2019 Caesar Act, which will enable foreign governments, businesses, and individuals to do business in Syria.

Waivers, however, are only a partial solution. Without a permanent removal of sanctions, which in the case of Caesar Act sanctions will require congressional approval, uncertainty about whether sanctions will simply return in six months could hinder Syria's economic recovery. Some investors that are close to the Trump administration or accustomed to working in sanctioned economies may not be deterred. But many international companies and firms looking for long-term ventures may still hesitate to invest. They could choose to play it safe and avoid doing business in Syria altogether, as many have done throughout the country's civil war.



There is more that the Trump administration can do. The State Department can work toward de-classifying HTS as a foreign terrorist organization, which would require determining that the original conditions for the designation are no longer applicable or that there are national security reasons for removing it. The department should similarly aim to remove Syria's designation as a state sponsor of terror, on the basis of a fundamental change in the country's leadership and policies, along with assurances from the current leadership that it is not supporting terrorism now, nor will it in the future. Without these designation removals, relaxing export controls will likely be difficult.

For now, sanctions relief is already enabling Gulf countries and other actors to invest in Syria. Three days after Trump's sanctions announcement, an Emirati company signed an $800 million memorandum of understanding with the interim government in Damascus to develop the Syrian port of Tartus and establish industrial and free trade zones. Qatar and Saudi Arabia have already paid Syria's debt, allowing the country to secure loans and cash infusions from international financial institutions, such as the World Bank. Syria can also be reintegrated into the global financial system. For example, reentering the SWIFT system—which is vital for sending money between banks, international wire transfers, and other payments—would facilitate remittances and other international transactions.

Under the Assad regime, the Syrian economy barely stayed afloat, propped up by Iran and Russia, drug trafficking, and humanitarian aid. Lifting sanctions would allow reconstruction to begin in earnest. Syria's oil and gas, raw materials, and manufacturing sectors could be revived, generating revenue for the government and providing livelihoods for many of the country's citizens. The energy sector in particular needs investment; Syria produced nearly 400,000 barrels of oil per day in 2010, before the civil war, but by the time Assad fell last year, that output had fallen to 40,000 to 80,000 barrels per day. On the individual level, sanctions relief will help Syrians living abroad invest in their country by making it easier to send money home. None of this progress is guaranteed—not all reconstruction efforts will be attractive to investors, and the shutdown of the U.S. Agency for International Development by the Trump administration leaves a large gap that other funders will need to fill. But sanctions relief gives Syria options beyond depending on other sanctioned countries and illicit activities to survive.

Sanctions are not the only obstacle threatening to destabilize Syria. Since the ouster of the Assad regime, a competition has emerged to gain economic and political advantage in the weakened country. One of the main players is Israel. The Israeli military has launched hundreds of strikes into Syria and occupied parts of southern Syria, and the Israeli government has stoked sectarian division by claiming that the incursion is an attempt to protect the Druze minority. Israel has also lobbied the United States to maintain sanctions on Syria and allow Russia to keep its military bases in the country. The United Arab Emirates has been mediating secret talks between Israel and Syria, and Shara has said repeatedly that he does not want a war with Israel. The Syrian government even returned the belongings of the Israeli spy Eli Cohen, who was executed in Damascus in 1965 after his espionage was discovered, in a goodwill gesture. But Israeli occupation of Syrian territory continues. The Trump administration's outreach to Shara does seem to have softened Israel's stance. as Israeli airstrikes on the country have subsided in the days since. Now, the U.S. president should further wield his leverage to rein in Israel's disruptive operations.

Other regional actors have jumped into the fray, too, looking to ink investment deals with the new Syrian government that may or may or may not serve the country's long term-interests. In December, for example, Turkey announced a plan to negotiate an exclusive economic zone agreement with Syria that would define maritime boundaries to give each country exclusive rights to explore and exploit resources, including oil and gas, within its own zone. There may be an economic benefit for Syria in such an accord, but it would also inflame disputes over existing maritime boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean, putting Syria in conflict with its neighbors.



There are ways that Turkey can play a more constructive role. The Syrian government, free of sanctions, could work with Ankara on its plans to build an energy transit infrastructure connecting the Levant, the Gulf, and potentially Europe. Turkish assistance to the Syrian military could deter attacks by foreign militaries or the so-called Islamic State, as long as that support does not compromise Syria's independence or aggravate the security concerns of other actors, particularly Israel.

An Israeli-Turkish clash in Syria is a troubling possibility. In March, an Israeli news outlet reported that the Israeli government was preparing for the possibility of such a confrontation. More recently, Israel and Turkey have engaged in talks to dial down tensions and establish a hotline for that purpose in Syria. Yet as the Syrian government and its security forces rebuild, Israel and Turkey could vie for influence over that process in ways short of direct military confrontation. The U.S. government has likely already pushed Israel to step back by engaging with the interim Syrian authorities, the Gulf states, and Turkey itself. But continued U.S. diplomacy can help ensure that Syria does not once again become a playground for regional rivalries.

For Syria to take charge of its own defense, including conducting its own counterterrorism operations, it will need the economic resources and international assistance to reconstruct and unite its military and security services. Right now, the security situation is tenuous. HTS does not control all areas of the country and has trouble commanding some of the fighters within its ranks. It has even less of a hold on other forces, such as the tens of thousands of fighters in the Free Syrian Army, which takes more direction from Ankara than from Damascus. Militias composed of former Assad regime elements have regrouped on Syria's coast, and the Islamic State is resurging in the east. Some Kurdish and Druze armed groups have not given up on the prospect of autonomy in a post-Assad Syria. Managing this fractured security environment will be difficult without external support, including training on mitigating harm to civilians. The challenge will be to build disciplined security and police forces that protect, rather than extort from, the Syrian people. Syrians are glad to be rid of the Assad regime's checkpoints, set up to monitor citizens and demand bribes—but they also fear a return to corruption and violence should the country's economic recovery falter.

Those fears are not baseless. Syria is surrounded by cautionary tales of post-conflict mismanagement. Corruption became entrenched in Iraq during the reconstruction process that followed the U.S. invasion in 2003, and in Lebanon after the end of the 1975–90 civil war there. A handful of politicians and businesses grew wealthy at the expense of basic services and economic development for the broader populations. The failure of transitional governments to develop integrated economies led to growing sectarian conflict and left vacuums for nonstate actors to fill. Iraq is still struggling to diversify its oil-dependent economy and promote sustainable development in its agriculture and energy sectors, in large part because of endemic corruption and the interference of Iran and nonstate groups in the Iraqi economy. Likewise, the productive sectors of the Lebanese economy faltered as dependence on cheap imports increased in the postwar era. Warlords turned politicians pursued infrastructure projects that benefited them personally rather than fostering broad-based growth.

Past experience with post-conflict reconstruction around the world shows that transparency and inclusivity in government decision-making are the best antidotes to corruption, economic stagnation, and other common maladies in recovering countries. So far, however, Washington's demands of the new Syrian government have been limited to security-related matters, such as the expulsion of foreign militants, and have neglected the political and institutional reforms needed to ensure a peaceful transition.



This is a mistake. The aspirations that Syrians fought and died for must not be overlooked. Facing no pressure from the United States—or from governments in the region that fear a successful democratic movement in Syria that could inspire unrest in their own countries—Shara has consolidated power. But if the Syrian government ignores the will of Syrians who rose up against Assad's authoritarianism, it risks reigniting conflict and reviving nefarious forces such as the Islamic State.

What happens in Syria could affect stability well beyond its borders. Beginning in 2011, the Syrian civil war displaced millions of people, creating a wave of refugees on Europe's borders. One result was the rise of far-right parties across Europe, which took advantage of a popular backlash against migrants to draw a surge of electoral support. The Iranian government, meanwhile, exploited the Assad regime's weakness to strengthen its influence across Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, destabilizing those countries and strengthening armed nonstate groups. Syria's pariah status under the Assad regime also made it impossible to take meaningful steps toward regional integration, from negotiating trade deals to building new gas pipelines.

Rather than repeating that history, Syria's post-Assad transition could be a catalyst for growth and stabilization. When Trump announced that he was ending U.S. sanctions, he said that the move gave Syrians “a chance at greatness.” To keep that chance alive, his administration must build on the current momentum and ensure that the U.S. government follows through on his promise—and that actors in Syria and across the region do not spoil the process. Lifting sanctions was the first pivotal step toward a stable, fruitful post-Assad transition in Syria. It must certainly not be the last.

The time has come for the United States to build a collective defense pact in Asia. For decades, such a pact was neither possible nor necessary. Today, in the face of a growing threat from China, it is both viable and essential. American allies in the region are already investing in their own defenses and forging deeper military bonds. But without a robust commitment to collective defense, the Indo-Pacific is on a path to instability and conflict.

Tactical shifts aside, Beijing's geopolitical aspirations for “the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” remain unchanged. China seeks to seize Taiwan, control the South China Sea, weaken U.S. alliances, and ultimately dominate the region. If it succeeds, the result would be a China-led order that relegates the United States to the rank of a diminished continental power: less prosperous, less secure, and unable to fully access or lead the world's most important markets and technologies.

After decades of pouring resources into its armed forces, China could soon have the military strength to make that vision a reality. As CIA Director William Burns revealed in 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed his military “to be ready by 2027 to invade Taiwan.” But as Burns went on to note, China's leaders “have doubts about whether they could accomplish that invasion.” To sustain those doubts—concerning Taiwan but also other potential targets in the region—should be a top priority of U.S. foreign policy. That requires convincing Beijing that any attack would ultimately come at an unacceptable cost.

With that objective in mind, the United States has invested in advanced military capabilities and developed new operational concepts. It has moved more mobile and lethal military forces to strategic locations across Asia. Crucially, it has overhauled its security partnerships in the region. In past decades, Washington's principal focus was to forge close bilateral ties. In recent years, by contrast, the United States has pursued a more networked approach that gives U.S. allies greater responsibilities and encourages closer ties not just with Washington but among the allies themselves. These changes are creating novel military and geopolitical challenges for Beijing, thereby reinforcing China's doubts about the potential success of aggression. 

The new, more multilateral approach marks a critical step toward stronger deterrence. But the defense initiatives it has produced remain too informal and rudimentary. In the face of continued Chinese military modernization, true deterrence requires the will and capability that only a collective defense arrangement can deliver. Such an alliance—call it the “Pacific Defense Pact”—would bind those countries that are currently most aligned and prepared to take on the China challenge together: Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and the United States. Additional members could join as conditions warrant.

Skeptics may argue that such an arrangement is infeasible with a Trump administration that appears to disavow the importance of the United States' alliances. But the reality is that leaders in Washington and allied capitals are still working to deepen military cooperation in the Indo-Pacific despite economic and diplomatic tensions. As far as defense matters are concerned, there has been far more continuity than disruption to date. Provided the administration avoids debilitating economic measures targeting U.S. allies, the trends pointing the way toward collective defense in the region are likely to endure. And if the Trump administration ultimately lacks the vision and ambition to grasp this opportunity, defense establishments can and should still lay the foundations for future leaders.

This is not the first time Washington has confronted the question of how to design its security partnerships in Asia. After World War II, the United States crafted a network of alliances in the region, hoping to keep Soviet expansion at bay, entrench its own military presence—particularly in East Asia—and curb internecine tensions among its partners. This network, made up of separate security arrangements with Australia and New Zealand, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand, served its constituents well. It insulated large stretches of the Indo-Pacific from great-power conflict, setting the conditions for decades of remarkable economic growth. It also proved resilient, weathering the wars in Korea and Vietnam, successive waves of decolonization and democratization, and even the end of the Cold War itself.

Notably, the network never evolved beyond a set of disparate and almost exclusively bilateral alliances. In Europe, U.S. officials embraced collective defense: an attack on one ally would be treated as an attack on all. (Such was the logic behind the founding, in 1949, of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.) In Asia, however, similar aspirations foundered. As John Foster Dulles, one of the architects of the U.S. postwar security order, wrote in these pages in 1952, shortly before becoming secretary of state: “It is not at this time practicable to draw a line which would bring all the free peoples of the Pacific and East Asia into a formal mutual security area.”

For their part, many Asian leaders preferred strong bilateral relationships with the United States over closer links with former adversaries or historical rivals. Some worried that a collective defense arrangement would draw them into a great-power clash between Washington and Moscow. Others doubted that any such institution could overcome the legacies of conflict and mutual distrust among their neighbors and bring together members that were far apart both geographically and in terms of security concerns. The only seeming exception, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, proved the point. Founded in 1954, SEATO was a motley alliance among Australia, France, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It suffered from a lack of unity and quietly dissolved in 1977.

But times have changed. The conditions once preventing multilateral alignment in Asia are giving way to fresh calls for collective defense. Just before taking office last year, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba warned that “the absence of a collective self-defense system like NATO in Asia means that wars are likely to break out.” In fact, such a collective defense pact is now within reach. Three trends buttress this conclusion: a new strategic alignment centered on an advancing threat from China, a new convergence of security cooperation among U.S. allies, and the demand for a new reciprocity that gives the United States' partners a larger role in keeping the peace.

China's assertiveness throughout the Indo-Pacific is spreading a sense of insecurity, particularly as leaders in Beijing lean on the military as a central instrument in their revisionist aims. The dangerous and threatening activities of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), combined with its rapidly growing capabilities, have prompted leaders across the region to adopt new defense strategies arrayed against what they perceive as a growing threat from China. New military investments and activities have followed suit.

Nowhere is this strategic reorientation more apparent than in Tokyo. Despite deep economic interdependence between China and Japan, ties between the two countries have been frail for decades, strained by historical animus, trade tensions, and territorial disputes. Relations have only worsened in recent years, as Beijing has leveraged its budding economic and military power to ramp up pressure on its neighbor. A new law, passed in 2021, allows China's coast guard to use weapons against foreign ships sailing in what Beijing considers its sovereign waters. In the years since, Chinese incursions into the areas surrounding what Japan refers to as the Senkaku Islands—administered by Japan but also claimed by China, which refers to them as the Diaoyu Islands—have become more frequent, with greater numbers of larger and more heavily armed vessels. In March, Chinese coast guard ships entered the territorial waters around the islands and lingered for nearly 100 hours—the longest episode to date in a string of incidents that Japan's top diplomat described as “clearly escalating.”

Tokyo is responding by loosening long-standing political and legal constraints on its armed forces. As early as 2013, the country's first-ever publicly released national security strategy warned of China's “rapidly expanded and intensified” activities around Japanese territories. Not long after, the Japanese government reinterpreted the country's pacifist constitution, allowing its armed forces to work more closely with partner militaries. In recent years, it has embarked on a historic military buildup, pledging to double its military spending to roughly two percent of its gross domestic product. Tokyo has also moved beyond its erstwhile focus on defensive capabilities and now aims to acquire and deploy “counterstrike capabilities,” including hundreds of long-range Tomahawk missiles. These changes, as the political scientist and Japan expert Michael Green wrote in these pages in 2022, are establishing Tokyo as “the most important net exporter of security in the Indo-Pacific.”

The Philippines is undergoing a similar transformation. For decades, the Philippine armed forces battled insurgents in the southern reaches of the archipelago. Military investments and operations reflected that domestic focus. Today, the insurgency has weakened, but an external threat looms larger and larger: steady Chinese encroachment on Philippine maritime rights and sovereignty, primarily in the South China Sea. In the 2010s, Beijing pursued an unprecedented campaign of land reclamation and built military bases atop reefs and islets that are also claimed by the Philippines and other Southeast Asian states. China has cordoned off one of these atolls, Scarborough Shoal, denying access to Philippine fishing vessels. At another reef, Second Thomas Shoal, violent attacks by Chinese vessels have disrupted efforts to resupply Philippine military personnel. Chinese coast guard ships have even harassed vessels conducting energy exploration inside the Philippines' exclusive economic zone. 



The view from Manila has sharpened accordingly. Beginning under President Rodrigo Duterte in the late 2010s and accelerating under his successor, Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., the Philippine military has been undertaking an ambitious modernization effort. The government adopted a watershed defense strategy in 2024 to secure the country's periphery with investments in additional combat aircraft, tougher cyberdefenses, and more unmanned assets for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. There is little doubt about what is driving the overhaul: the need to better monitor and confront China's coercive activities.

In Canberra, a few thousand miles to the south, the rise of China was once considered benign and beneficial to Australian interests. A series of diplomatic and military incidents in the past decade, however, have convinced many that the opposite is true. Revelations of malign Chinese Communist Party influence in Australian elections and policymaking ignited a political firestorm. And after Australia's government called for an independent investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, China unleashed a barrage of tariffs and other restrictions on Australian exports.

In the South China Sea, Australian armed forces have suffered the same malign pattern of harassment by Chinese jets and warships. The PLA is also operating closer than ever to Australia's shores. Earlier this year, Chinese naval vessels circumnavigated Australia and disrupted commercial air traffic with live-fire exercises in the Tasman Sea. And amid intense efforts by China to make security inroads with Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and other Pacific Island countries, Australia's foreign minister said in 2024 that her country is now “in a state of permanent contest in the Pacific.”

Against this backdrop, Canberra, too, is revising its defense priorities from top to bottom. As recently as 2016, the government's official view was that a foreign military attack on its territory was “no more than a remote prospect.” By 2024, its updated national defense strategy warned that, owing to the present realities in the Indo-Pacific, “there is no longer a ten-year window of strategic warning time for conflict.” Instead of preparing for a wide variety of contingencies around the world, including counterterrorism in the Middle East, the Australian Defence Force is gearing up to fend off major threats closer to home. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has unveiled plans for record military spending, including major investments in stockpiles of critical munitions such as long-range fires, antiship missiles, and missiles for air defense. The reforms highlight a growing conviction that the country's advantageous geography no longer offers sufficient protection against the PLA. The public shares that apprehension: according to the Lowy Institute, a leading Australian think tank, the share of Australians who believed China would become a military threat to their country nearly doubled from 2012 to 2022. It now stands above 70 percent.

Japan, the Philippines, and Australia have not only come to recognize China as their primary and common threat; they also increasingly acknowledge that their fates are intertwined with the broader region. This is true even on issues as sensitive as Taiwan, once a taboo subject in the region: “A Taiwan emergency is a Japanese emergency,” former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared in 2021. “If something happens to Taiwan, inevitably we will be involved,” the Philippine military chief warned earlier this year.

The view that Chinese aggression would have massive consequences for countries throughout the Indo-Pacific has resulted in an unprecedented deepening of security partnerships among Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and other regional powers. Analysts have described defense cooperation between Australia and Japan in particular as taking on “alliance-like characteristics.” A new reciprocal access agreement allows the Australian and Japanese militaries to operate in each other's countries. August 2023 marked the first-ever visit by Japanese F-35 fighter jets to northern Australia, followed only days later by the inaugural deployment of Australian F-35s for military exercises in Japan.

Japan is finalizing a similar access agreement with the Philippines, which has emerged in recent years as the largest recipient of Japanese security assistance. In February, defense leaders from the two countries announced a spate of measures for closer security cooperation. In what could be read only as a thinly veiled reference to China, the Philippine secretary of defense explained that Manila and Tokyo's “common cause” was to resist “any unilateral attempt to reshape the global order.”

That newfound common cause has animated a series of overlapping, complementary initiatives—what, in 2024, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin called “the new convergence in the Indo-Pacific”—that build on the United States' traditional focus on bilateral ties in the region. The Biden administration in particular worked to supplement the older “hub-and-spokes” model with what it envisioned as a “latticework” of relationships in Asia. The AUKUS partnership brought together Canberra, London, and Washington to help Australia build conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines. As members of the Indo-Pacific Quad, Australia, India, Japan, and the United States joined efforts to provide maritime domain awareness throughout the region. American officials also stepped up trilateral security cooperation with Japan and South Korea.

Among the many partners involved in these efforts, Canberra, Manila, and Tokyo frequently stand out as common denominators. At a meeting of their leaders in 2024, the Japanese, Philippine, and U.S. governments expressed “serious concerns” about China's “dangerous and aggressive behavior” and announced initiatives on infrastructure investment and technology cooperation, among other measures. Later that year, Australian, Japanese, and U.S. defense leaders unveiled another set of cooperative activities, including three-way military exercises and advanced defense industrial cooperation. Perhaps most promising of all is a new grouping that brings together all four of these parties—Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and the United States. Known informally as “the Squad” (to distinguish it from the Quad), the group conducts regular naval, maritime, and air force exercises in the South China Sea. It also plans to strengthen information sharing and work together to modernize the Philippine military.

The new convergence in the Indo-Pacific represents a profound development in the security architecture of the region. But it is best viewed as an incomplete evolution—an important period of transition rather than an optimal end state. The shortcomings are significant. There are no mutual defense obligations between U.S. allies, only with the United States. There is no central headquarters to plan and conduct multilateral operations. And the unofficial nature of these groupings means that there is no regular drumbeat of planning among political and military staffs. Coordination is occurring, but only intermittently. As a result, it rarely receives the necessary urgency, attention, and resources.

A collective defense pact would deliver where the current mechanisms fall short. Getting there would not require a panregional security organization such as NATO, which grew from 12 original members to over 30. Instead, the logical starting point for Washington is to form a pact with the three partners that are most strategically aligned and have the fastest-growing and most robust combined military cooperation: Australia, Japan, and the Philippines.

Additional members could join later, circumstances allowing. As an advanced and stalwart ally in East Asia, South Korea would be an obvious candidate, and its contributions could be quite significant. But Seoul would have to decide whether it was willing to focus its defense forces more on China, partner more closely with Japan, and support a broader regional orientation for its own military and the tens of thousands of U.S. troops stationed on the peninsula. New Zealand would be another prospective partner, especially since it is already part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group alongside Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. But although New Zealand has recently shown greater willingness to challenge China and align more closely with the United States, it might not yet be prepared to enter a formal collective defense pact. 



Critical U.S. partners such as India and Singapore would not be expected to join at the outset but could still participate in certain activities as observers or in some other nonmember capacity, as is common in regional groupings. The inclusion of Taiwan would not be possible or advisable under current U.S. policy, nor would it be acceptable to the other members of the pact. As for the United States' European allies, they are neither politically nor militarily ready to join as full members right now, but that option could be considered in the future, under different circumstances. Larger defense budgets in Europe could produce militaries with more global reach, provided the continent itself is secure and at peace.

Given the urgency of the China challenge, the United States cannot afford to wait for a perfect alignment among all its partners. There is already a core group in place and room to consider additional members in the future. Preparations should begin now. Given that alliances with the United States already exist, a first-order task is to establish mutual obligations among Australia, Japan, and the Philippines themselves. This will demand skillful leadership and intense negotiations, but the benefits of stronger deterrence and greater security should outweigh the risks of closer alignment. Besides, for Australia and Japan in particular, the practical differences between today's defense partnership and one of mutual defense are relatively small and shrinking by the day.

From an operational perspective, collective defense could build on existing cooperative projects, including in the areas of intelligence sharing, maritime domain awareness, combined training and exercises, and command and control. One such project is the Bilateral Intelligence Analysis Cell, a new U.S.-Japanese effort at Yokota Air Base that monitors Chinese activity in the East China Sea. Japan and the United States could share the cell's intelligence with Australia and the Philippines, which could in turn contribute personnel at the air base and provide data from their own unmanned surface and aerial platforms. Likewise, the recently inaugurated U.S.-Philippine Combined Coordination Center near Manila could include Australia and Japan, providing similar functions in the South China Sea.



The U.S. military has major operating bases in Japan, access to locations in the Philippines, and regular rotations of U.S. troops throughout Australia. With sufficient legal underpinning—including reciprocal access agreements among the three Asian allies— each of these arrangements could be expanded to include forces from the other members. In fact, there are already plans to integrate Japanese forces into U.S. initiatives in Australia.

The four members could also invest in shared military facilities. Major bilateral and trilateral military exercises involving different combinations of the partners could include all four. Together, they could more readily pre-position weapons to ensure sufficient stockpiles in the event of conflict, further strengthening deterrence. Establishing a headquarters for the Pacific Defense Pact and mechanisms for command and control will be essential. Japan could serve as one potential location. In July 2024, the United States announced its intent to upgrade the U.S. military command in Japan to plan and direct more missions in the region with its Japanese counterpart. As new facilities and communications links are established to support this effort, U.S. and Japanese officials should ensure that it will be possible to include military commanders and personnel from Australia and the Philippines. Alternative locations for the headquarters could be considered in Australia or at U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii.

The four countries should establish a series of working groups to negotiate the full range of policy and legal issues associated with more integrated planning and operations. Military and civilian staff from defense and foreign ministries could work together to develop proposals for governance and decision-making processes, including personnel structures and consultation mechanisms that form the engine rooms of day-to-day alliance management. This breadth of tasks only underscores the need to start consultations as soon as possible.

In addition to deepening their collective cooperation with one another, U.S. allies will also need to rebalance their bilateral security partnerships with Washington. In their current form, those partnerships reflect the asymmetries of a different era, when American military primacy appeared uncontested and immutable. Bilateral treaties in the region were restricted in scope to specific local geographies, and the contributions of allied militaries were limited by design. In essence, the United States promised protection in exchange for military access and political-economic comity in Asia but without demanding fully reciprocal protection for itself.

This framework was sustainable—both strategically and politically—as long as the U.S. military retained its dominance in the region, the threat from China was confined, and the potential contributions of U.S. allies were limited to their own self-defense. None of these conditions holds true today. The PLA now poses serious challenges to the U.S. military and the American homeland. And U.S. allies in Asia are now among the wealthiest and most advanced countries in the world, capable of playing a significant role in both deterrence and warfighting. To adapt to this new reality, U.S. alliances need to build on a foundation not of asymmetry but of reciprocity.

Domestic politics in the United States also makes greater reciprocity necessary. Although most Americans support military ties in principle, increasing numbers would like to see U.S. allies contribute more in practice. U.S. President Donald Trump has focused in particular on the notion that allies need to pay their “fair share,” casting doubts on whether the United States would defend NATO members that failed to meet certain levels of military spending. U.S. allies do need to spend more on defense—but reciprocity should extend far beyond bigger military budgets.



U.S. allies will also need to commit to greater degrees of mutual obligation with the United States. Washington's security treaty with Tokyo, for instance, is bound only to “the territories under the administration of Japan.” The resulting imbalance is on display at every major bilateral summit, where U.S. leaders reaffirm their commitment to defend Japan and Japanese leaders stay silent on whether their forces would assist the U.S. military elsewhere. Instead, U.S. allies should commit to supporting the United States both in crises throughout the region and in defending the U.S. homeland.

This new reciprocity would further enable collective defense. The upshot of more mutual obligation would be that U.S. allies could take on new roles and missions in crises and conflicts, especially when combined with recent investments in their own militaries. This would, in turn, open new pathways for cooperation that do not exist today in sufficient form: members of the pact could draft combined military plans, more effectively target their defense spending toward specialized and complementary capabilities, and rehearse and improve together through tailored military exercises and operations. These measures would fortify the collective power and deterrence of the United States' alliances far beyond what is possible under today's informal mechanisms.

Greater reciprocity should also entail greater clarity on what military strategists refer to as “access, basing, and overflight”—that is, the ability of the U.S. military to operate in and around allied territory. Given the vast distances involved, forward-deployed U.S. forces are essential to ensuring rapid response times and sustaining the military during a contingency. More certainty surrounding U.S. military access would strengthen deterrence in the western Pacific by ensuring that the United States would have the right forces and capabilities ready to fight in the right places. More assured access would also lead to greater infrastructure investments and the deployment of more advanced capabilities, which further enhance the potential utility of various locations. While U.S. allies should not be expected to give the U.S. military a blank check, a robust Pacific Defense Pact will require more flexible and assured access for U.S. forces.

Collective defense touches on matters of sovereignty and treaty obligations, deeply political issues that require intense negotiations and deft diplomacy. This will be all the more challenging if the Trump administration moves forward with punishing tariffs or other measures that strain Washington's alliances in the region. But even amid tense diplomatic relations, defense and military establishments can continue laying the foundations for collective defense. Short of a severe break in ties, the four partners should work as best they can to silo security cooperation from economic and diplomatic disagreements. The stakes are simply too high to do otherwise. It is also worth underscoring that the demand for more reciprocal relationships has become a political and strategic imperative that spans the partisan divide in Washington.

The evidence to date is that the United States and its Indo-Pacific allies are managing to deepen defense cooperation despite political and economic headwinds. This is largely owing to the mounting threat from China, the continued demand for a U.S. military presence in the region, and the growing trend of intra-Asian security cooperation. To be sure, the Trump administration may be too divided, distracted, or confrontational to play the winning hand it has been dealt. In that case, many of the building blocks can still be put in place for a future administration. Given the number of tasks ahead, a pact might not be finalized until the next U.S. administration anyway.

For their part, leaders in Canberra, Manila, and Tokyo will need to win the support of their respective domestic publics. Beyond strategic arguments about deterrence and national security, the United States can support these conversations by highlighting the potential benefits to its allies' domestic constituencies. These could include technology sharing, infrastructure investments, and improved disaster response. In the United States, skeptics can be assured that a defense pact in the Pacific would entail no obligations for the U.S. military beyond what is already in place—but that it would reduce threats to the U.S. homeland and to U.S. troops.



Given the historic significance of such an arrangement, Washington should also be prepared to manage reactions and concerns from others in the Indo-Pacific. U.S. officials can underscore that a Pacific Defense Pact would be but one of several components of its approach to the region. In both rhetoric and practice, Washington should remain committed to a network of overlapping and complementary institutions, including the Indo-Pacific Quad, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and trilateral cooperation with Japan and South Korea. The publicly stated objective of the pact should be the pursuit of a “free and open Indo-Pacific,” a goal shared by nearly every country in the region.

Moreover, the pact should remain focused on defense rather than subsuming or taking on the economic and diplomatic roles of other important institutions. Indeed, the pact will be most successful if complemented by a robust regional trade agenda, active diplomatic efforts, and effective foreign assistance programs.

Protests from Beijing will no doubt be as loud as they are predictable. China has long accused the United States of “Cold War thinking” and “bloc politics.” PLA officials have already warned that current U.S. efforts to bring American security partners closer together are “tying the region's countries to the U.S. war chariot.” These refrains will feature prominently in China's reaction precisely because a stronger coalition could stymie Beijing's revisionist ambitions. To push back and make potential members think twice about a new pact, Beijing will likely draw from its traditional playbook of disinformation and economic coercion. With that in mind, the United States should help its allies prepare for China's efforts to scuttle a collective defense arrangement in Asia.

None of this will be easy. But neither was the great progress that Washington's allies have already made, not only in acknowledging the threat from China but also in taking unprecedented steps to invest in their own militaries, build ties with their neighbors, and double down on their alliances with the United States. In fact, in recent years, Australia, Japan, and the Philippines have already made moves on defense and security matters that were previously deemed implausible. The conditions are now set for strong leadership to transform a collective defense pact in Asia from something once unimaginable into a defining feature of the region's future peace and prosperity.

            The Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear an appeal from a Massachusetts middle school student who was forced to remove a T-shirt that claimed “there are only two genders.”
    


            Two conservative justices — Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas — dissented from the decision to not hear the case.
    


            So long as the appeals court's decision remains on the books, Alito wrote, “thousands of students will attend school without the full panoply of First Amendment rights. That alone is worth this court's attention.”

Supreme Court enters final stretch of term poised to decide cases on birthright citizenship, transgender care and religion



            The student, Liam Morrison, wore the shirt to Nichols Middle School in Middleborough, Massachusetts, in 2023 to “share his view that gender and sex are identical.” School administrators asked him to remove it and, when he declined, sent him home for the day. Weeks later, he wore the same shirt but covered the words “only two” with a piece of tape on which he wrote “censored.”
    


            The case arrived at the Supreme Court at a moment when transgender rights have become a political and cultural flashpoint. The high court is already considering other cases dealing with LGBTQ+ rights, including a major challenge to Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for minors.
    


            David Cortman, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, which represented Morrison, called the Supreme Court's decision disappointing.
    


            “Schools can't suppress students' views they disagree with. Here, the school actively promotes its view about gender through posters and ‘Pride' events, and it encourages students to wear clothing with messages on the same topic,” Cortman said. “Our legal system is built on the truth that the government cannot silence any speaker just because it disapproves of what they say.”
    


            Morrison and his family sued the district in federal court, asserting a violation of his First Amendment rights. The district court ruled against him, and the Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision.
    


            “We should reaffirm the bedrock principle that a school may not engage in viewpoint discrimination when it regulates student speech,” Alito wrote in his dissent. “By limiting the application of our viewpoint-discrimination cases, the decision below robs a great many students of that core First Amendment protection.”

            In a landmark 1969 decision, Tinker v. Des Moines, the Supreme Court affirmed students' First Amendment rights at school, but the court qualified those rights, allowing school administrators to regulate the speech if it “materially disrupts” instruction. The Vietnam-era case permitted a group of students to wear black armbands in protest of the war.
    


            The appeals court in the T-shirt case held that schools can regulate a student's speech under Tinker if it “assertedly demeans characteristics of personal identity” of other students because the message is “reasonably forecasted” to poison the “educational atmosphere.” Morrison argued that decision “sidelined” Tinker and “gave near-total deference to the school's determination of what speech demeans protected characteristics and substantially disrupts its operations.”
    


            In their written response to the Supreme Court, school officials noted they are aware of transgender and gender-nonconforming students “who had experienced serious mental health struggles, including suicidal ideation, related to their treatment by other students based on their gender identities” and that those struggles could impact the students' ability to learn.

            National Public Radio filed a First Amendment lawsuit against the Trump administration on Tuesday, alleging that President Trump's attempt to defund NPR is a “clear violation of the Constitution.”
    


            Several NPR member stations from Colorado joined the national network in filing the suit, highlighting the local impacts of taxpayer-funded media.
    


            The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, DC, says Trump's maneuvers against NPR violate both “the expressed will of Congress and the First Amendment's bedrock guarantees of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association.”
    


            Moreover, it “threatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information,” the lawsuit states.
    


            Trump targeted both NPR and its television counterpart, PBS, in an executive order on May 1. The president accused the public media outfits of bias and said the Corporation for Public Broadcasting must stop funding them.
    


            The White House reiterated its claims of bias on Tuesday, saying CPB “is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime.”
    


            Public media executives say the White House is grossly mischaracterizing what NPR and PBS do. But the allegations of bias are at the heart of the lawsuit; the suit says the defunding order is “textbook retaliation” for the network's perceived point of view. In the realm of First Amendment law, this is known as viewpoint-based discrimination.
    


            Trump's move against NPR “really is just pure viewpoint discrimination,” Theodore Boutrous, one of the veteran attorneys representing NPR in the suit, told CNN.
    


            Boutrous also said that the 1967 law creating public broadcasting was clearly meant to “insulate” the networks from “precisely this type of political coercion.”
    


            The corporation, CPB for short, is a private nonprofit corporation that was set up to be free of presidential interference. CPB has filed its own lawsuit against the president's attempt to fire three of its board members.
    


            Each year, the CPB disburses $535 million in taxpayer funds to public radio and TV stations nationwide and to producers of educational and cultural programming.
    


            Stations, in turn, provide free and universal access to news, emergency alerts and a wide array of programming.
    


            In Trump's first term, he repeatedly tried to strip all funding from PBS and NPR, but Congress allocated the funds anyway. In Trump's second term, he is trying new ways to shut down the public broadcasters.
    


            In so doing, he is usurping Congress, NPR charges.
    


            The Republican-controlled House and Senate allocated funds for public radio and TV as recently as this March — in a bill that Trump signed into law.
    


            That very funding is what Trump is now trying to erase and what NPR is trying to preserve.
    


            PBS has also been preparing to take legal action but has not yet filed suit. “PBS is considering every option, including taking legal action, to allow our organization to continue to provide essential programming and services to member stations and all Americans,” a spokesperson told CNN.

Live Updates


            • The latest: Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs, is testifying in his criminal sex-trafficking trial.
    


            • Previous testimony: Rapper Kid Cudi — who had a brief relationship with Cassie Ventura — testified last week about his interactions with Combs. Ventura testified earlier in the trial that she endured physical and sexual abuse from Combs and detailed how he orchestrated drug-fueled sex performances called “Freak Offs.”
    


            • Federal charges: Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison.
    


            • Editor's Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence, there are resources available, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline.



            Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs, is back on the stand following a lunch break, and the jury is returning.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo is continuing cross-examination.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian is back on the bench following the lunch break. Lawyers are discussing upcoming exhibits before the jury is brought in.
    


            Prosecutors said that they are so far ahead of schedule, their case is likely shaping up to last five weeks instead of the six weeks they originally estimated.
    


            The jury has been dismissed for a lunch break until 1:15 p.m. ET.
    


            Capricorn Clark, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former employee, testified she texted Combs in June 2021, “Did you ever know that I had the biggest crush on you before I started to work for you?”
    


            “We hung out all the time, I played it super cool,” she said. “I don't think you knew. I just knew for sure that you liked to have me around.”
    


            Clark testified she doesn't remember saying this to Combs but recalled reaching out to him in 2021.
    


            It's unclear how Combs responded to the texts.
    


            Capricorn Clark, a former employee for Sean “Diddy” Combs, testified that she met Combs around 2002 through a mutual friend shortly after she moved to New York City.
    


            She said her relationship with Combs was “1,000%” platonic.
    


            Clark said Combs took ecstasy in the early stages of their friendship, and his drug use increased over time.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo began by confirming with Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs, that they had met before.
    


            Agnifilo, Teny Geragos, and another attorney for Sean Combs, Jonathan Davis, met with Clark, who brought an attorney and a friend with her on April 10, 2024.
    


            Agnifilo asked Clark to confirm that she told the lawyers at the meeting that Combs “wouldn't be in this mess if he had kept (her) around.”
    


            She acknowledged she probably said something like that as they discussed the possibility of her returning to work for him as his chief of staff.
    


            She also told the lawyers at the meeting that Cassie Ventura wasn't good for Combs.
    


            The attorney who accompanied Clark to that meeting was Bryan Freedman, the well-known entertainment lawyer representing Justin Baldoni in the ongoing litigation with Blake Lively.
    


            Returning to that meeting in April 2024, Agnifilo suggested that she was told it would be impossible to hire her amid the ongoing criminal investigation into Combs. She said she didn't remember that being said.
    


            Capricorn Clark, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs and a former employee of his Sean John fashion company, is back on the stand after a short break. The jury is entering.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo has begun cross-examination.
    


            Since Sean “Diddy” Combs federal criminal trial began earlier this month, three of the music mogul's former assistants have been called to testify about their experience working for him, with patterns starting to emerge.
    


            On the stand today is Capricorn Clark, a former personal assistant to Combs and former marketing executive for his clothing brand Sean Jean.
    


            So far, Clark testified that she was subjected to taking a lie detector test, threats and intimidation, and witnessed Combs be violent with Cassie Ventura. She also described an encounter where she saw Combs enter rapper Kid Cudi's home after he found out about his relationship with Ventura, an incident that Kid Cudi testified about last week.
    


            Clark is the third former Combs assistant to testify, joining David James and George Kaplan. Her testimony continues this afternoon.
    


            James was an assistant for Combs from 2007 to 2009 and worked for Combs during the early part of his relationship with Ventura. He testified he did not personally observe physical violence between the two.
    


            James described witnessing Combs use drugs and testified about his role in stocking hotel rooms for him when he traveled. He also testified about being subjected to lie detector tests and intimidation.
    


            Kaplan testified last week that he left the company because he was not “comfortable or aligned with the physical behavior” that he observed over several months, and recounted instances in which he saw Combs be violent with Ventura and another former girlfriend.
    


            Kaplan also said part of his job as Combs' assistant was to clean up the hotel rooms Combs stayed in and, at one point, he said he picked up drugs for him.
    


            Another high-ranking executive on Combs' team, Kristina Khorram, Combs' former chief of staff, has been mentioned several times during testimony throughout the trial, but there is no indication yet whether she will be called to testify.
    


Remember: Combs is facing charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. The government alleges that between 2004 and 2024, Combs created a criminal enterprise using his business empire where he engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.
    


            Jurors in the Sean “Diddy” Combs' federal racketeering and sex-trafficking trial have heard from 17 witnesses so far.
    


Here's a recap of what was said:



Capricorn Clark, former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs and Cassie Ventura:



            Sean “Diddy” Combs' mother and sister are inside the courtroom today. After court recessed for a short break, Combs' mother kissed defense lawyer Nicole Westmoreland on the cheek.
    


            Combs' sister Keisha, who has been a constant presence at the trial, is also present today.
    


            None of Combs' children are in the courtroom. Combs' mother was overheard saying she attended her granddaughters' graduation and prom.
    


            During Capricorn Clark's emotional testimony, she often patted her eyes with a tissue. She seemed to avert her eyes from Combs but as she was leaving the courtroom during the break, she looked over toward his direction, clenched her jaw and nodded.
    


            Prosecutors' direct-examination of Capricorn Clark is over.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo will begin cross-examination after court takes a short break.
    


            Capricorn Clark, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former employee, testified that she retained attorneys in 2023 after Cassie Ventura filed her lawsuit against Combs. The lawsuit “traumatized” Clark, she said.
    


            Clark met with attorneys for Combs in April 2024, and they spoke about the possibility of her working for one of Combs' companies again. She said she wanted her life back. Clark never heard from Combs' attorneys after that.
    


            Clark testified that she hasn't spoken to Ventura since 2018.
    


            The prosecution needs to show a pattern of “criminal activity” by Sean “Diddy” Combs and his associates to reinforce the racketeering conspiracy charge, CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson said.
    


            “We're talking about the prosecution saying it was a criminal racketeering enterprise, a conspiracy, and so in order to do that you have to get people in your inner circle –– as we see the assistants who have testified so far –– that would establish that over a period of time there was illegal things happening in this business. That he was agreeing with his confederates who were acting as, really, as underbosses, to carry out his lawless activities,” Jackson told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.
    


            Jackson added the prosecutors will have to make sure their witnesses help their case by establishing a pattern of criminality.
    


                    “A pattern of threat, a pattern of guns, a pattern of drugs, a pattern of all this lawlessness that would go to show that this was a criminal enterprise that was designed to engage in such behavior over (a) continuous period of time … will be very significant if prosecutors want to get through the threshold of proving that it was indeed a criminal racketeering conspiracy,” Jackson noted.
                





            Though she was fired in 2012, Capricorn Clark returned to work for Sean “Diddy” Combs as Cassie Ventura's creative director in 2016, Clark testified.
    


            Clark hadn't been able to find other work, and she “wanted to try to get (her) life back,” Clark testified. Clark reported to Combs, and he approved all of Ventura's projects, Clark said.
    


            Clark testified she noticed an increase in Ventura's drug use during this time.
    


            Clark left the position in 2018, and that was the last time she worked for Ventura, she testified.
    


            Capricorn Clark, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former employee, said after she was terminated, Combs told her, “That I would never work again, that he would show me that all these people weren't my friends, that he would make me kill myself.”
    


            Clark testified that she received a settlement through Combs' attorneys over wrongful termination allegations in the fall of 2012.
    


            She did not disclose the amount on the stand.
    


            Capricorn Clark said she was fired in August 2012.
    


            She said she was still being sent work while she was on vacation, so she told an HR employee that Sean “Diddy” Combs was mad at her because she “didn't tell him his girlfriend was cheating on him.”
    


            She was terminated shortly after, she said, accused of improperly taking vacation.
    


            After the December 2011 incident, Sean “Diddy” Combs told Capricorn Clark she couldn't be friends with Cassie Ventura; they could only see each other for work.
    


            Clark testified that her relationship with Ventura changed after that.
    


            Clark also said that in early 2012, she informed someone in human resources and Harve Pierre, the former president of Bad Boy Records, about the kidnapping incident and how Combs wanted to kill Kid Cudi and beat Ventura.
    


            Pierre just told her, “That's crazy, but it's going to be OK.”
    


            After the events of late 2011, Sean “Diddy” Combs would angrily ask Capricorn Clark why she didn't tell him about Cassie Ventura's brief relationship with Kid Cudi, Clark testified.
    


            One time, Combs told her, “I should kill you b*tches, and I should cut her face,” Clark testified.
    


            Clark estimated Combs threatened her about 50 times between December 2011 and the following summer.
    


            Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs, said arson investigators reached out to her in 2012, asking her to make a statement about an arson incident involving Kid Cudi's vehicle.
    


            Clark said she hung up the phone and did not provide a statement.
    


            “I wanted this whole thing to be over,” she testified.
    


            Clark added that she never discussed an arson incident involving Cudi with Combs.
    


Remember: Cudi testified last week that one morning in January 2012, his dog watcher called him from his home to tell him that his car was on fire. Looking at photos, Cudi explained that it looked “like the top of my Porsche was cut open, and that's where the Molotov cocktail was put in,” causing further damage that couldn't be salvaged,
    


            The jury again saw the email Cassie Ventura sent Capricorn Clark and her mother on December 23, 2011, under the alias “Veronica Bang,” referencing the threats from Sean “Diddy” Combs to Ventura and Kid Cudi.
    


            Clark testified she can't remember if she responded to the email.
    


            Capricorn Clark said that after Sean “Diddy” Combs allegedly broke into Kid Cudi's home, she approached Cassie Ventura, who was still with Kid Cudi.
    


            Clark told them, “If you tell on him, he's going to hurt us all.”
    


            According to Clark, Ventura responded by asking her, “Do you really think he will?”
    


            Clark said Ventura then went with Clark to Combs' Los Angeles rental home. Combs in a robe and underwear and “immediately began kicking Cassie,” Clark testified.
    


            Clark said she and a security guard stood by as Combs repeatedly kicked Ventura. Clark said Combs threatened to hurt her, too, if she tried to stop him from hurting Ventura.
    


            Clark said she left after the security guard told her to leave, and Ventura was still on the ground while Combs continued to kick her.
    


            Clark said that she called Ventura's mom, Regina Ventura, as she left the property.
    


                    “Please help her. I can't call the police but you can,” Clark recalled telling Ventura's mother.
                





            Regina Ventura said she would handle it and hung up, Clark said.
    


            Former Sean “Diddy” Combs employee Capricorn Clark is now testifying about what happened directly after the episode in which she says Combs and a security guard were at Kid Cudi's home in December 2011.
    


            Clark, Combs, and his security guard went to a nearby nightclub, she said. Combs directed Clark to call Cassie Ventura and tell her that “he has me, and he's not going to let me go until I come get her,” Clark testified
    


            On the phone, Ventura responded that Clark should come get her, Clark testified.
    


            Combs then said she and Ventura needed to convince Kid Cudi to not tell police that Combs was involved in the break-in at Kid Cudi's home, Clark testified.
    


            Combs told her, “If you guys don't convince him of that, I'll kill all you,” according to Clark.
    


            Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs, warned Cassie Ventura that Kid Cudi shouldn't face off against Combs.
    


            Clark testified she told Ventura, “Cassie, stop him, he's going to come get himself killed.” Ventura said she couldn't stop him. Clark testified she understood Kid Cudi was on his way to the house.
    


            When Combs got back in the car, he asked who Clark had been talking to. He called Ventura's burner phone, which was the last record in Clark's call log. Combs, furious, said, “B*tch what the f**k is this number.”
    


            A short time later, Kid Cudi pulled up next to Combs' Escalade outside his home and then accelerated away. Combs' vehicle followed in pursuit. “It felt like forever, but couldn't have been longer than a minute,” Clark testified about the pursuit.
    


            Capricorn Clark is giving more details about what happened after Sean “Diddy” Combs' showed up at her home in December 2011.
    


            She said she and Combs got into the backseat of a car that one of his security guards was driving. There gun was in Combs' lap, Clark testified.
    


            They drove to Kid Cudi's house, where Combs and the security guard entered the home, Clark said.
    


            Clark said she stayed in the car and called Cassie Ventura — Combs' former girlfriend who was dating Kid Cudi at the time — on a burner phone. She testified that she told Ventura that Combs had come to her house with a gun and then gone to Kid Cudi's house to kill him.
    


            She said she then changed Ventura's contact name in the phone to the name “Stormy” so Combs wouldn't know she called Ventura.
    


            Clark said she could hear someone yelling, “He's in my house?” in the background when they were on the phone, and Ventura told her she was with Kid Cudi.
    


            One day in December 2011, Sean “Diddy” Combs showed up at Capricorn Clark's home, banging on her door. According to Clark, she could see through the peephole that Combs' pants were split up the inseam from the knee upward, exposing his underwear.
    


            When she opened the door, Clark saw that he was holding a gun and was furious.
    


            Combs, entering her home, said, “Why didn't you tell me?” and asked her about Kid Cudi.
    


            Clark testified that Combs, still holding the gun, told her, “Get dressed, we're going to go kill” him.
    


            When she tried to protest, Combs said, “I don't give a f**k what you want to do, go get dressed.”
    


            Clark said she was afraid, and this was the first time Combs had been to her home in Los Angeles.
    


            Clark said Combs was “livid, furious, mad at me.”
    


            “I had never seen him with a weapon, I had never seen him making me do something like this,” she said.
    


            Capricorn Clark's voice has been quivering through much of her testimony Tuesday morning.
    


            Clark, a former employee for Sean “Diddy” Combs, has been describing what it was like to work for the rapper.
    


            Capricorn Clark, former employee for Sean “Diddy” Combs and his Sean Jean fashion company, has started testifying about Cassie Ventura dating  the rapper Kid Cudi in December 2011.
    


            Clark, Ventura and Kid Cudi sometimes would hang out, she said. One time, Ventura texted her, asking if they could pick up Kid Cudi, and Clark told Ventura to delete the text because Combs paid for both of their phones, Clark testified.
    


            Clark said she was “very concerned” about Combs finding out about the relationship between Ventura and Kid Cudi. Clark then took Ventura to Best Buy to buy a burner phone, she testified.
    


Remember: Ventura dated Combs from around 2007 to 2018. Kid Cudi testified last week that when he dated Ventura in December 2011, he believed at the time that Ventura was not romantically involved with Combs anymore.
    


            In 2011, Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs, was also managing Cassie Ventura as her creative director.
    


            Clark said Combs had final approval over everything, including Ventura's physical appearance and every opportunity Ventura could or couldn't take.
    


            Capricorn Clark, a former employee for Sean “Diddy” Combs, said she returned to work for the hip-hop mogul after a 2006 incident at his Miami home, but not directly under him.
    


            Clark testified that she accepted the director of marketing position for “Sean John” women's line because she didn't have to work directly with him.
    


            “I didn't want that close proximity in his personal orbit like that,” she said.
    


            Capricorn Clark, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, recounted a time she was at Combs' Miami home in the summer of 2006. She said when she arrived, Combs told her, “I don't care what goes on this weekend, you are not to leave this house.”
    


            Combs later directed Clark to escort a guest to another location in Miami, and she said she stayed for about an hour before receiving a call from Combs asking where she was.
    


            Clark said when she returned to Combs' home, he told her, “See, your problem is you want a life, and you can't have that here,” and again told her not to leave the house.
    


            The following day, Clark said she told Combs' chef, “I hate it here,” and the chef relayed that to Combs.
    


                    “He immediately looked at me and said, ‘You hate it here?' and he charged me,” Clark testified.
                





            She said Combs began pushing her and demanding she get out of his house. Clark said Combs pushed her about 30 yards using about 75% of his force, she said.
    


            Eventually, one of Combs' security guards intervened by telling Combs to stop and telling Clark to go pack her belongings. Clark testified she left her job after this incident because “it was crossing my boundary.”
    


            Capricorn Clark, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former employee, recalled a time when Combs had 100,000 euros that he made from club bookings in Europe.
    


            Clark said she personally counted the cash and believed Combs kept it in his personal safe in his bedroom.
    


            Capricorn Clark saw Sean “Diddy” Combs doing ecstasy and molly about once a week, in addition to prescription medication, she testified.
    


            Combs' drug use increased over time, she said. A man called “One Stop” usually provided the drugs when they were in Los Angeles, and the drugs usually were delivered to her or to Combs directly, she said. Combs asked her to get him ecstasy fewer than 10 times, she said.
    


            Clark saw Combs offer drugs to his friends and girlfriends, she said.
    


            During a trip to France in 2006, Combs asked her to get cocaine, and when she asked Combs who it was for, Combs responded that it wasn't for him, she testified. Clark then had the security guards obtain the drugs, she testified.
    


            Clark also would get prescription drugs for Combs, she said. Sometimes the prescriptions were made out to her, and other times they were made out to Combs, she testified.
    


            The testimony of Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean “Diddy” Combs, should help corroborate both Kid Cudi and Cassie Ventura's testimonies, but the prosecution still has a lot to prove in other areas of the case, according to CNN legal analyst and former prosecutor Jennifer Rodgers.
    


            “It seems to me that (prosecutors) have decided to start with this bucket: Cassie Ventura, her testimony, and then all of the testimony that corroborates her,” Rodgers told CNN. “But I think the jury is thinking about this conspiracy… . You need two people to criminally conspire for this racketeering conspiracy to work.”
    


            Rodgers added she thinks prosecutors need to answer more questions for the jury related to the racketeering conspiracy charge.
    


            Those other questions include laying out “where are the other conspirators – not only who did things for him, like any employee would, but who had a meeting of the minds, a criminal meeting of the minds that they were all together in this enterprise,” Rodgers said.
    


            As for how the prosecution may go about proving the alleged criminal acts Combs committed within his business empire, Rodgers said they need to “identify” people within his business who may have been “involved in the criminality of what they were doing.”
    


            Rodgers said they can also show that “through testimony,” with witnesses saying they were directly “criminally involved” or by naming others who “knew what was going on.”
    


            When Sean “Diddy” Combs traveled, his rooms were usually reserved under the names Frank Black or Frank White, Capricorn Clark, Combs' former assistant, testified.
    


            The name Frank Black was a reference to the late rapper and Bad Boy Records artist Notorious B.I.G., who had a nickname of Frank White.
    


            “I would unpack all of his clothes and shoes and personal belongings and put them in their place,” she said.
    


            Combs traveled with a toiletry bag containing drugs and a camera box, which had four cameras along with a small bottle of baby oil and a small bottle of lube, according to Clark.
    


            Clark said she would also bring candles to provide lighting in the rooms.
    


            After Combs' stay, Clark said she would sweep the room for anything left behind. She said she sometimes saw damage to the rooms, including “handprints left in oil.”
    


            Capricorn Clark continues to testify about her early employment under Sean “Diddy” Combs, when she was his personal assistant around 2004 to 2006.
    


            At one point, a human resources representative from Bad Boy presented Combs with a sheet that calculated what Clark was owed for overtime, $80,000, for a three-month period, she said.
    


            “He ripped up the paper,” Clark said. She was never compensated for the overtime, Clark testified.
    


            Capricorn Clark, the former director of marketing for Sean “Diddy” Combs, typically worked from 9 a.m. until 4 a.m. as Combs' personal assistant without breaks for meals.
    


            Combs told her that if she failed to complete any tasks, she would lose her job, she testified.
    


            She said that on a good night, she got four hours of sleep and developed stress-induced alopecia.
    


            Clark made $65,000 annually at the time, she said.
    


            Capricorn Clark, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, said that after he accused her of stealing diamond jewelry from him, she was given a lie detector test.
    


                    “I was petrified,” Clark said.
                





            At one point, the man administering the test told her she needed to calm down because the results were inconclusive.
    


            “I'm not getting a good reading, you need to you're going to be in the East River if I cant get a reading on this,” Clark recalled the man saying.
    


            “I couldn't calm down,” she said.
    


            Eventually, one of Combs' security guard took her home and picked her up the next day to repeat the same process. Clark testified she was taken to the same vacant office building for questioning with the lie detector for five straight days.
    


            She said she didn't want to do it but thought the lie detector was the only way to prove her innocence.
    


            Clark said she didn't report the incident to the police because she worked under a non-disclosure agreement. Judge Arun Subramanian sustained a defense objection to the testimony about the NDA and told the jury to disregard it.
    


            After the five days for tests, Combs' security told Clark she could return to work, she said. Clark testified that Combs never asked her where she was during those five days and he never mentioned the lie detector tests to her. She said she didn't know if the jewelry was ever found.
    


            One time, Sean “Diddy” Combs accused Capricorn Clark of stealing diamond jewelry that was on loan to him from a jeweler, the former assistant testified.
    


            Clark had been assigned to hold the jewelry as they traveled from New York to Miami. She realized the bag holding the jewelry was missing before they got to the airport, Clark testified.
    


            Combs went on to Miami, leaving Clark with a security guard who questioned her for hours and then searched her apartment.
    


            The next day, the security guard picked her up from her home and left her in a locked vacant office space with another man who administered a lie detector test on her.
    


            Clark testified that the man told her at the time that if she failed the test, “they're going to throw you into the East River.” She described him as “very wide” but never learned his name.
    


            When Capricorn Clark was Sean “Diddy” Combs' personal assistant, she heard him discuss guns once, she testified.
    


            Clark, Combs and his then-manager got into an elevator after Combs did an MTV event that also involved rapper 50 Cent, she said.
    


            Combs told his elevator companions he had an issue with 50 Cent, and after further conversation, Combs said, “I don't do that; I like guns,” Clark testified. Combs' demeanor was very serious, she said.
    


            On her first day working for Sean “Diddy” Combs in 2004, Capricorn Clark said he took her to Central Park with his security guard some time after 9 p.m. ET. There, he brought up her former employment with Death Row Records, which was founded by Combs' rival Marion “Suge” Knight.
    


            “He told me that he didn't know that I had anything to do with Suge Knight and if anything happened, he would have to kill me,” Clark testified.
    


            The security guard stood by silently while Combs threatened her, Clark said. She said she told Combs at the time, “we'll just have to see.”
    


            She testified that she felt she couldn't convince him that she was trustworthy at the time and said could've been more transparent about her employment background.
    


            Capricorn Clark, the former director of marketing for Sean “Diddy” Combs, said she has been involved in the music industry since shortly after graduating from high school, when she landed an internship with Def Jam Records.
    


            She said both of her parents died shortly after that, which meant she had to “start life a lot earlier.”
    


            After Def Jam, she worked for Death Row Records, which Suge Knight then managed. Around 2004, she started working for Combs at Bad Boy Entertainment as his personal assistant, she said.
    


            After briefly leaving in 2006, she returned to work for Combs in 2007 as the director of marketing for Sean John Women's.
    


            She said she became a global brand director in 2008 before being terminated in 2012. She then worked as Cassie Ventura's creative director from 2016 to 2018.
    


            The jury has entered, and prosecutors have called Capricorn Clark, a former director of marketing for Sean “Diddy” Combs, to the stand.
    


            Clark is the 17th witness called by the prosecution. Assistant US Attorney Mitzi Steiner will question her.
    


            Clark came up in last week's testimony by rapper Kid Cudi.
    


            As jurors head into a third week of testimony in the Sean “Diddy” Combs federal criminal case, prosecutors are still working to prove Combs was involved in a criminal enterprise, engaged in arson, kidnapping and other illegal acts.
    


            But have they done enough? Not yet, according to CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney, Joey Jackson.
    


            Prosecutors are attempting to lay the foundation for the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs faces through witnesses who spoke about Combs' alleged involvement with arson and extortion, Jackson told CNN's Sara Sidner.
    


            Rapper Kid Cudi, who dated Combs' ex-girlfriend and key witness in trial, Cassie Ventura, testified and accused Combs of setting his Porsche on fire with a Molotov cocktail while he was dating Ventura.
    


            Last week, Ventura's mother testified about taking a home equity loan to get $20,000 to pay Combs, asked for to “recoup money he had spent” on her daughter “because he was angry that she had been in a relationship” with Kid Cudi.
    


            In order to further prove the racketeering charge, prosecutors need to establish “continuous use of the enterprise over a significant period of time, not just these one-off activities, and sexual exploitation and trafficking would lead to that.”
    


            Prosecutors “have to show more coercion and forced activity,” Jackson said.
    


            The Los Angeles Fire Department investigator who led the investigation into the fire set to Kid Cudi's Porsche at his home in January 2012 is expected to testify today.
    


            The investigator is expected to say that he concluded that the fire was deliberately set and caused by a Molotov cocktail dropped into the Porsche.
    


            Over an objection from prosecutors, Judge Arun Subramanian said the defense can ask the investigator about his report that says partial female DNA was recovered from the glass bottle used to create the explosive.
    


            Court has resumed in the sex-trafficking trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs as it enters its third week of testimony.
    


             Judge Arun Subramanian is on the bench. Prosecutors and defense attorneys are discussing some issues before the jury enters.
    


            Former Combs' employee Capricorn Clark is expected to testify today followed by witnesses from the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles Fire Department, according to prosecutor Maurene Comey.
    


            The jury has already heard from two other former assistants for Combs, George Kaplan, and David James.
    


            The government has called sixteen witnesses so far.
    


            Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison.
    


This post has been updated with additional information.



            A woman identified as Victim-3 in Sean “Diddy” Combs' federal criminal case is not expected to take the stand in the trial, according to a source familiar with the case.
    


            “She didn't want to testify,” the source said, not providing any further details.
    


            Victim-3 was referenced in the government's superseding indictment as part of the racketeering conspiracy count. The indictment states that Combs and his associates wielded his power through his business empire to “intimidate, threaten and lure” at least three female victims – “Victim-1,” “Victim-2” and “Victim-3” – under the pretense of a romantic relationship and coerced them into engaging in commercial sex acts. Prosecutors allege some of these sex acts, known as “Freak Offs,” involved male sex workers who were transported across state lines.
    


            Three sources familiar with the case told CNN that Victim-3 is the woman who has been referred to as “Gina” throughout the trial. Gina has been described in testimony as an ex-girlfriend of Combs.
    


            CNN has reached out directly to Victim-3, regarding her participation in the case.
    


            Last week, Combs' former assistant George Kaplan testified that he once witnessed Combs throwing apples at Gina at his home in Miami. Cassie Ventura, the case's star witness and another former girlfriend of Combs, testified that Combs was unfaithful to her by continuously dating Gina during their 11-year relationship. And Ventura's former best friend, Kerry Morgan, corroborated Ventura's account in her own testimony, saying on the stand that Gina was a problem in Ventura and Combs' relationship.
    


            Prior to the start of testimony at the trial, prosecutors indicated in early May that they may not call Victim-3 as a part of their case. Assistant US Attorney Maurene Comey said they “may” try to call her, but said that while she's under subpoena to testify, “she may not show up.” Comey noted that it's been difficult to get in touch with Victim 3's lawyer.
    


            In court on Wednesday, outside the presence of the jury, defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said that Gina “is out of the case. Gina is not coming.”
    


            Assistant US Attorney Christy Slavik said that Gina was “very much a part of this case,” adding that she was identified in the indictment.
    


            CNN has reached out to the prosecutor's office for comment.
    


                    “My point is not an indictment issue. The government can call Gina if it wants to,” Agnifilo responded. “It might be difficult. It might be hard to do. They are the United States of America. They can get Gina into this courtroom if that is what they want to do.”
                





            CNN has reached out to a representative for Combs for comment.
    


CNN's Kara Scannell and Nicki Brown contributed to this post. 



            The trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs resumes today after court took a break for the Memorial Day holiday weekend.
    


            As the second week of Sean “Diddy” Combs' racketeering trial wrapped up on Thursday, all eyes turned to another entertainer, Scott “Kid Cudi” Mescudi, whose explosive testimony about Combs included allegations of a burned-out Porsche and a frightened dog.
    


            CNN entertainment correspondent Elizabeth Wagmeister joined Laura Coates to break it all down on the latest episode of the “Trial By Jury: Diddy” podcast. You can listen to it here. 



            Prosecutor Maurene Comey on Thursday said the first witness they'll call today will be former Sean “Diddy” Combs' employee Capricorn Clark.
    


            After Clark, prosecutors plan to have witnesses from the Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles Fire Department. Comey said the prosecution's case is running on time.
    


            The jury has already heard from two other former assistants for Combs, George Kaplan and David James.
    


            The third week of testimony in Sean “Diddy” Combs' criminal sex trafficking trial begins today.
    


            Over the past two weeks, the jury has heard from 16 witnesses, including Cassie Ventura — the prosecution's star witness who testified for several days about the abuse she said she endured during her relationship with Combs.
    


Here's a look at who else has taken the stand so far:

            Southwest Airlines has put a price tag on checking bags, a coveted free perk that is about to disappear as part of substantial changes the carrier is making to its service.
    


            For flights booked on May 28 and after, checking the first bag will cost $35 and $45 for the second piece of luggage. If the ticket was bought prior to Wednesday, the customer will still receive two free checked bags, the company announced.
    


            There are some exceptions, however: Members in the A-List tier of its Rapid Rewards loyalty program, holders of its branded credit card or those traveling on a business fare will be exempt from the charges.
    


            Southwest's fee are aligned with other carriers' prices. Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines all charge between $35 to $40 for the first checked bag. Others, like JetBlue Airways and Frontier Airlines, charge different fees depending on various factors including if it's purchased online or departure date.
    


            Southwest has always offered free checked bags since the airline started about 60 years ago and kept the policy in place when its competitors starting adding and increasing fees. In fact, the carrier has trademarked its “bags fly free” slogan, which has been a key part of its advertising.
    


            Adding these fees will likely instantly boost its bottom line because Southwest has two to three times as many checked bags as other airlines.
    


            Despite not charging for the first two checked bags, Southwest collected $83 million in baggage fees in 2024, according to Department of Transportation statistics. (Southwest charges $150 for a third checked bag and up to $200 for overweight luggage among other fees).
    


            However, that is a fraction of the baggage fees collected by other airlines, with American collecting $1.5 billion in 2024, while United pulled in $1.3 billion and Delta garnering $1 billion.
    


            Southwest has been under pressure to boost profitability since activist investor Elliott Investment Management took a $1.9 billion stake in the carrier last year. It has already announced that it's ditching its open-seat policy in 2026 and retrofitting its planes with seats that have extra legroom for an additional charge.

            Southwest said customers were clamoring for those changes. When people switch to a competitor from Southwest, the company said the top reason passengers cite is open seating. But the change will also help the company charge some passengers more for their tickets.
    


            The airline has also changed the way it sells tickets. Traditionally it only sold them on Southwest's website, but recently started sell them on Expedia to attract more customers.
    


            Also beginning Wednesday, Southwest will start selling “basic economy” fares, which are low-priced tickets but with tons of restrictions. It's a ticket type that's replacing its famous “Wanna Get Away” fare and is becoming increasingly common among larger carriers to compete against low fares offered by budget airlines.

Police arrest man, rule out terrorism","https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/26/europe/liverpool-car-hits-pedestrians-latam-intl","Tue, 27 May 2025 10:18:45 GMT","

Follow:


            Dozens of people, including four children, were injured when a driver plowed a car into a parade in northwest England celebrating Liverpool Football Club's latest Premier League win on Monday evening.
    


            A 53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area, believed to be the driver, was arrested at the scene, according to Merseyside Police. Describing the collision as an “isolated incident,” police said they were not looking for any other suspects and were not treating the incident as terrorism.
    


            Police will reveal the findings of an investigation into the collision so that “all the facts are known,” according to Liverpool's mayor, Steve Rotheram.
    


            “It's not for people on social media to be speculating what happened,” the mayor told CNN on Tuesday, describing the “terrible event” late Monday. “The police are the only people who have all of that information to hand – and they are the people we should trust.”
    


            Footage from Reuters news agency on Tuesday morning shows the scene littered with debris and closed off with police tape. A police van is parked across the street, blocking the road.
    


            Hundreds of thousands of jubilant soccer fans had lined the streets in the heart of Liverpool on Monday, waving flags and flares of red smoke, to watch an open-top bus victory parade to celebrate the iconic club's 20th top-flight league title.
    


            As the parade was winding down, those scenes of joy turned to chaos. Video from social media appears to show a gray minivan plowing into red-clad supporters. The angry crowd can then be seen surrounding and rocking the stopped vehicle.
    


            A total of 27 people were taken to hospital, the head of service at North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust David Kitchin told a news conference. Four of those were “very ill in hospital,” according to Rotheram.
    


            Four people – three adults and one child – had to be removed because they were trapped underneath the vehicle, according to Chief Fire Officer of Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service Nick Searle. A further 20 people were treated at the scene for minor injuries, he added.
    


            “This gray people carrier just pulled up from the right and just rammed into all the people at the side of us … It was extremely fast. Initially, we just heard the pop, pop, pop of people just being knocked off the bonnet of a car,” one fan, Harry Rashid, told the UK's PA Media news agency.
    


            Rashid, who attended the parade with his wife and two young daughters, said crowds of people ran over and started to smash the car's windows. “It was horrible. And you could hear the bumps as he was going over the people … I saw people lying on the ground, people unconscious. It was horrendous. So horrendous,” he said.
    


            Video posted on social media appears to show a confrontation between the driver and the crowd at one point during the incident. The car is seen stopped and some in the crowd can be seen kicking and punching the car, which then quickly reverses before driving off.
    


            Onlooker Matthew O'Carroll told Britain's PA news agency that he saw the car approaching the top of Water Street. He said the vehicle drove past a parked police van at a “decent” speed and that the driver was beeping as he went through the crowd.
    


            Footage shared by Reuters news agency showed emergency services tending to people, some being carried into ambulances on stretchers. Photos from the scene also showed authorities cordoning off the heavily littered roads. Police set up a tent where the crash occurred.
    


            “We heard a frantic beeping ahead, a car flew past me and my mate, people were chasing it and trying to stop him, windows smashed at the back,” Peter Jones, who had traveled to Liverpool to attend the parade, told the Associated Press. “He then drove into people, police and medics ran past us, and people were being treated on the side of the road.”
    


            The local police force said they were contacted just after 6 p.m. local time (1 p.m. ET) “following reports a car had been in collision with a number of pedestrians” in the city center.
    


            Merseyside Police said it had been working with the organizers of the parade and a “robust traffic management” plan was put in place before the incident unfolded.
    


            “Extensive enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances leading up to the collision and it is vital that people do not speculate or spread misinformation on social media,” Merseyside Police's Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims said in a statement.
    


            The parade on Monday – which coincided with a separate May public holiday in the UK – involved players from the Liverpool squad being driven around the city center in an open-top bus and gleeful fans had joined the festivities along the 10-mile (16 kilometers) route.
    


            Figures from across the sporting world paid tribute to those who were injured by the attack, which survivors say left the city reeling after the celebrations.
    


            Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who attended the parade, said he was “shocked and devastated.” “Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who are injured and affected,” he posted on Instagram. “You'll never walk alone,” he added, in reference to the club's anthem. A titan of world soccer, the German notably led Liverpool to its first league title in 30 years, in 2020.
    


            Longtime opponents Manchester United and, Everton Football Club, the local rival team to Liverpool FC, offered their condolences online – as did the Premier League.
    


            UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the whole country “stands with Liverpool” on Tuesday. “My thoughts and the thoughts of the whole country are with all of those that are affected, those injured, which of course includes children, their families, their friends… Liverpool fans everywhere,” the prime minister added, thanking emergency services “who did a fantastic job and continue to do so.”

FAIRMONT, W.Va. (AP) — American gymnastics icon Mary Lou Retton faces a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence following her arrest in her West Virginia hometown.

Fairmont police stopped Retton on May 17 following a report about a person in a Porsche driving erratically. According to the criminal complaint, Retton smelled of alcohol and was slurring her words, and she failed a field sobriety test. Officers also reported observing a container of wine in the passenger seat.

Retton, 57, refused a roadside breath test and a blood test. She was released from custody after paying a $1,500 personal recognizance bond.

Her attorney listed in court records, Edmund J. Rollo of Morgantown, did not immediately respond to phone and email requests from The Associated Press seeking comment.

Retton was 16 when she became the first American female gymnast to win the all-around at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. She also won two silver and two bronze medals to help bring gymnastics into the mainstream in the United States.

In 2023, Retton's family disclosed she was recuperating from a rare form of pneumonia that landed her in intensive care. Doctors found her oxygen levels dangerously low. Her medical team considered putting her on a ventilator as her conditioned worsened. Retton went on oxygen treatment and, after weeks in the hospital, improved enough to be sent home.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected the appeal of a Massachusetts student who was barred from wearing a T-shirt to school proclaiming there are only two genders.

The justices left in place a federal appeals court ruling that said it would not second-guess the decision of educators in Middleborough, Massachusetts, to not allow the T-shirt to be worn in a school environment because of a negative impact on transgender and gender-nonconforming students.

Educators at the John T. Nichols Middle School barred the student from wearing the T-shirt and an altered version with the words “two genders” covered up by tape with the word “censored” written on it.

Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented.

The court should have heard the case, Alito wrote, noting that “the school permitted and indeed encouraged student expression endorsing the view that there are many genders,” but censored an opposing view.

“This case presents an issue of great importance for our Nation's youth: whether public schools may suppress student speech either because it expresses a viewpoint that the school disfavors or because of vague concerns about the likely effect of the speech on the school atmosphere or on students who find the speech offensive,” Alito wrote.

The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it was reasonable to predict that the T-shirt will “poison the educational atmosphere” and disrupt the learning environment.




The school district's decision was in line with a landmark Supreme Court ruling from 1969, Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, that upheld the right of public school students to wear black armbands to protest the Vietnam War when it did not create a substantial disruption to education.

LONDON (AP) — Liverpool is no stranger to triumph on the sports field, or tragedy off it.

The northwest English port city experienced both joy and anguish on Monday: As fans lined the streets to celebrate Liverpool Football Club winning the Premier League title this season, a minivan crashed into the crowd. Police said more than 60 people were hurt, with 11 still hospitalized Tuesday. Police arrested the 53-year-old driver on suspicion of attempted murder but said they are not treating it as an act of terrorism.

Euphoria – at least for those who support Liverpool FC over its local rival Everton – turned in an instant to chaos and grief. Within hours, came pledges of resilience and unity for a city that has weathered so much before — including deadly disasters at two stadiums hosting Liverpool games in the 1980s.

“It's supposed to be celebrations and instead the day is always going to be remembered for this now, instead of the trophy parade like it was supposed to,” said Aaron Jones, a 28-year-old fan who was nearby and saw the emergency response.

“Because of disasters we've had in the past, everyone's just connecting it to the same sort of group of disasters, you know what I mean? It should have been happy times, but (it's) been tainted.”




Liverpool was one of the world's busiest ports in the 18th and 19th centuries, but endured decades of hardship in the 20th. It weathered World War II bombing, the decline of its once-bustling docks and mass unemployment in the 1980s.

Those tough years reinforced the city's underdog self-image, as a northern, heavily Irish-influenced city far from British centers of power in London.

Renewal for the city that gave birth to The Beatles has come in recent decades through reinventing Liverpool as a magnet for tourists seeking culture, nightlife — and soccer.

Both the city's Premier League teams have legions of fans around the world. Liverpool FC, in particular, is one of the most decorated teams in global soccer, with dozens of British and international trophies to its name.

But the success has come alongside tragedy for a club whose anthem is “You'll Never Walk Alone.”

On Tuesday, Liverpool FC's homepage offered thoughts to those affected by the crash and referenced the disasters at Heysel and Hillsborough stadiums that had a profound impact on the club and its identity.

On May 29, 1985, Liverpool played Italian team Juventus in the European Cup final at Heysel Stadium in Brussels.

Crowd disorder before kickoff culminated in a surge by Liverpool fans into an adjacent stand containing mostly Juventus supporters. In the ensuing chaos, some were trampled or suffocated to death as they tried to flee the violence and others died when a retaining wall collapsed.

A total of 39 people — 32 from Italy, four from Belgium, two from France and one from Northern Ireland — died and around 600 were injured.

Liverpool fans were largely blamed for the violence. Twenty-six were arrested, and 14 of them convicted of involuntary manslaughter.

Many also attributed the disorder to the dilapidated condition of Heysel, a 55,000-capacity structure with outdated standing-room only stands, flimsy fences and crumbling walls inside and outside, as well as poor organization from police and UEFA, European soccer's governing body.

The 40th anniversary of the disaster is on Thursday.

Four years later, a crush during a game against Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield ultimately left 97 Liverpool fans dead.

The catastrophe unfolded when more than 2,000 Liverpool fans were allowed to flood into a standing-room section behind a goal with the stadium already nearly full for the game. The victims were crushed against metal anti-riot fences or trampled underfoot, and many suffocated.

The tragedy of Britain's deadliest sports disaster was compounded by a coverup into the cause and missteps by police. 

With hooliganism rife in English soccer throughout the 1980s and memories of Heysel still fresh, a false narrative that blamed drunken, ticketless and rowdy Liverpool fans was created by police and spread by sections of the media.

Bereaved families campaigned for years to correct the record, finally securing an inquest jury's 2016 verdict that police and emergency services were to blame for the disaster and the victims were “unlawfully killed.”

The city has a long memory. To this day many Liverpudlians refuse to read tabloid newspaper The Sun, which ran stories alleging that fans had attacked police and robbed the dead.

Many Liverpudlians — whether Liverpool or Everton fans — pledged that the city would come together after the latest tragedy.

Everton FC issued a statement of condolence, setting aside rivalry to say: “As a city we stand together.”

Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool City Region, said he'd heard multiple accounts of people opening their doors so distraught strangers could take shelter in their homes amid Monday's chaos.

“There were offers of lifts in cars so that people could get to their destinations,” he said. “This is the true humanity of the great people of this city.”

A Texas oil executive from Elon Musk's government efficiency team has been given sweeping powers to overhaul the federal department that manages vast tracts of resource-rich public lands, but he hasn't divested his energy investments or filed an ethics commitment to break ties with companies that pose a conflict of interest, records show.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum recently directed Tyler Hassen, who lacks Senate confirmation and has no public administration experience, to reorganize the Interior Department, which oversees some 70,000 employees in 11 agencies including the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

Before joining DOGE, Hassen spent nearly two decades as an executive at Basin Holdings, an enterprise involved in the manufacture, sale and servicing of oil rigs worldwide. A financial disclosure report obtained by AP shows Hassen made millions annually from these companies, owned by John Fitzgibbons — an industry giant who is well-connected in Russia.

These and other potential conflicts of interest are compounding the concerns of Democratic lawmakers, conservation groups and environmental advocates, who say Hassen's appointment appears designed to evade Senate confirmation and oversight while testing the limits of congressional authority.

“It's a dereliction of duty to offload decisions about staffing and funding at the Interior Department to someone who hasn't even been confirmed by the Senate,” said Kate Groetzinger, with the Center for Western Priorities, a nonpartisan conservation group.




Interior officials didn't respond to requests to interview Hassen.

Do you have a confidential tip for an AP reporter? Here's how to reach us securely. 

Department spokesperson Katie Martin said in an email that Hassen is helping achieve the president's vision for major changes, and Interior will “continue to prioritize retaining first responders, parks services and energy production employees.”

Once inside Interior in January, Hassen reviewed “every single contract, every single grant,” and sent action items to Burgum, he told FOX News in an April interview. Burgum praised Hassen and DOGE on X, saying they “have identified massive amounts of waste, fraud, and abuse already!”

A draft copy of Interior's new strategic plan includes increasing “clean coal, oil, and gas production through faster permitting” while reducing regulations to “generate more revenue from lands and resources for the U.S. Treasury.”

Hassen also has twice filed a notice in the Federal Register extending Trump's freeze on regulations — which stops agencies from proposing or issuing new rules — and removed the opportunity for public comment as “contrary to the public interest.” The latest extension pushes it to June 4.

It's unclear how Hassen became involved with Musk. There's little information about him online. He told FOX News that before DOGE, he was “running five businesses in Houston.” He said this work “is me giving back to the country.”

Hassen was an executive at Fitzgibbons-owned Basin Holdings — the privately held parent company for Basin Energy and Basin Industries — since 2008. An old Facebook page for Tyler Hassen includes a 2010 photo of him at the “Samotlor Field, Western Siberia - largest oilfield in Russia.”

Hassen's brother, Todd, is also a Texas energy executive. He's been CEO of Red Wolfpack Resources since 2024 and was with Tellurian, a natural gas company, and EagleStone Resources before that, according to his LinkedIn page.

Burgum named Hassen his assistant secretary for policy, management and budget in March, but changed his title in April to “principal deputy assistant secretary.” An assistant secretary requires Senate approval and an ethics commitment to resign positions that would create a conflict of interest. A principal deputy does not.

Kathleen Clark, a government ethics expert at Washington University in St. Louis, said Interior officials are committing fraud “by calling someone by a different name so that they don't have to file a really important document where they explain how they're going to comply with ethics standards.”

Hassen sought to fire a top department lawyer in April for refusing to give him and other DOGE officials access to a highly sensitive personnel database as he pushed for massive department-wide staff reductions through buyouts, early retirements and layoffs. Hassen wrote that Tony Irish, an associate solicitor, was “subverting, obstructing and delaying the process” and should be removed for misconduct.

Irish is on leave while appealing the firing and is represented by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. “In seeking to remove Tony Irish, Tyler Hassen has demonstrated his own unfitness for federal service,” PEER executive director Tim Whitehouse said in a press release. “This type of corporate bullying is not how the people's business is supposed to be conducted.”

Jacob Malcom, a former Interior Department executive, said Burgum's order directing Hassen to make “appropriate funding decisions” for administrative changes and ensure “the appropriate transfer of funds, programs, records and property” is unconstitutional — Congress appropriates funds, not assistant secretaries.

“Unless Congress has explicitly authorized those funds to be moved, they can't actually transfer the funds,” Malcom said. “That's just flat out illegal.”

Although Hassen didn't file a divestment commitment, he did file a financial disclosure in February — revised five times, the most recent dated April 21 — revealing he made almost $4 million annually from Fitzgibbon's oilfield services companies. Hassen said he sold his equity in these companies and is being paid in installments through June 2026.

Hassen reported that he holds $50,001 to $100,000 worth of stock in Fitzgibbon's company Block Harvest, a cryptocurrency mining business that uses flared natural gas to run data centers. He reported owning $250,000 to $500,000 worth of stock in Fitzgibbon's Global Guardian, a security company.

Hassen also declared 254 stock holdings, including cryptocurrency, tobacco, foreign banking and between $1,001 and $15,000 worth of stock each in Archrock, a Houston company that specializes in natural gas compression services; WEC Energy Group, which holds electric and natural gas companies and Quanta Services, which is involved in pipelines and pumping.

He's got a similar stake in Albemarle Corp., which owns the Silver Peak lithium mine in Nevada — the nation's only active lithium source. It's currently seeking authorization from Interior's Bureau of Land Management to expand its operations.

Hassen's potential conflicts of interest have raised concerns among environmental groups and some U.S. lawmakers.

He's attempting to remove regulations constraining the fossil fuel industries, said Josh Axelrod, a senior policy advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council. “As a member of those industries, he's uniquely qualified to flag the ones they don't like.”

Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine, the ranking Democrats on Interior's Senate and House oversight subcommittees, have demanded a stop to Hassen's large-scale reorganization.

Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico told Burgum in a May 7 letter that “delegating sweeping authorities and responsibilities to a non-Senate confirmed person in violation of the Vacancies Reform Act is baffling and extremely troubling.”

You'd be forgiven for looking around Andrei Kozlov's studio, dotted with paintings inspired by his eight months as a hostage of Hamas, and seeing only darkness — canvases splashed with grey and ochre, guns tucked into waistbands or resting against a wall, moments of angst and disbelief and pain.

Andrei Kozlov, an artist who was taken hostage by Hamas during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, speaks with The Associated Press during an interview Monday, May 19, 2025, at his studio in New York.

Andrei Kozlov, an artist who was taken hostage by Hamas during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, speaks with The Associated Press during an interview Monday, May 19, 2025, at his studio in New York.























NEW YORK (AP) — You'd be forgiven for looking around Andrei Kozlov's studio, dotted with paintings inspired by his eight months as a hostage of Hamas, and seeing only darkness — canvases splashed with gray and ocher, guns tucked into waistbands or resting against a wall, moments of angst and disbelief and pain.

He is a free man now, who often lets a wide smile spread across his face, who can't believe his luck of surviving it all, and who urges you to look further.

A painting of a blackened street his captors led him down is drowned in darkness, but in the distance is a sliver of cerulean sky. A screaming man's reflection is caught, but it's in a mirror on a bubblegum-pink wall. A house beside barren trees is seen in the desolation of night, but its windows glow with lamplight.

“When you're surrounded by something dark,” the 28-year-old Kozlov says, standing in a shared art studio he works at in the Hudson Yards neighborhood of New York, “there always can be light inside.”

Nearly a year after his release from captivity, Kozlov is familiar with juxtapositions.

He is mostly happy and well-adjusted, able to matter-of-factly describe his ordeal, but sometimes returns in his mind to what he went through. He is alive and filled with gratitude but feels the weight of those not yet free. He is no longer a hostage but knows the world may always see him as one.




“I will be a former hostage forever,” he says. “It will forever be a part of my life.”

Kozlov grew up in St. Petersburg, Russia, but had long felt a sense of wanderlust. After serving a mandatory year in the military, he decided he wanted to live in Israel, arriving in August 2022 and taking part in Masa, a gap-year program that included an internship in motion design at a Tel Aviv company. His life was carefree, reflected in Instagram posts of beaches, biking, surfing, road-tripping and otherwise enjoying the days of a relaxed, unemployed 20-something.

That ended on Oct. 7, 2023, the deadliest day in Israel's history. Kozlov had picked up a job working security at the Tribe of Nova music festival in southern Israel close to the Gaza border, barely sleeping in two nights keeping watch for ticketless intruders. On his third morning, daybreak unleashed hours of chaos and confusion, the sound of gunfire, mad dashes for escape, scaling down a cliff and ultimately being led to a vehicle that Kozlov believed would bring him to safety. He hadn't been killed, he rationalized, so he would be rescued. He never considered kidnapping.

He sent no messages to his family. He was sure he would survive. He'd be home by night, he thought.

Soon, though, Kozlov was in Gaza, tied with rope. Reality set in. Guns were aimed and blows were delivered. He was certain he knew what would come next.

“You are sure that you will spend the last moments of your life like that,” he says, “and maybe tomorrow they will kill you.”

Those first days of Kozlov's captivity were a “disgusting, terrible hell.” Over eight months, he says he was held in eight different houses, guarded by a rotating cast of two dozen militants who lived beside him.

Some, he said, feigned compassion; others treated their captives as animals. In some holding sites, he slept on a wet, sticky mattress that stunk of mold; others had far better conditions. Ropes were replaced by chains until restraints were removed altogether. He knows it could have been far worse.

“They didn't pull out my nails,” he says. “They didn't torture me with electroshock.”

In time, a weird normalcy set in. He spent time picking up Arabic from his captors and Hebrew from fellow hostages. They'd talk of music and women and life before. Days passed in endless hands of cards or invented games like listing 10 Will Smith movies or 100 songs with the word ‘love' in the title. 

He'd muse about escaping, but knew he'd never make it out alive. Sometimes, he wondered if he could telekinetically send a message to his parents. At others, this agnostic found himself trying to talk to God.

After a few months, his captors provided a small mercy: A pencil and a thin notebook.

Kozlov knew he had artistic talent from childhood, but it was a pastime that came and went. Sometimes, years went by without drawing. Now, with nothing but time, he drew daily — cartoonish aliens and Don Corleone of “The Godfather” and the summer home in Russia where he spent his happiest days of youth.

He wrote out goals, too. To go home the same person, or maybe better. To use his skills. To be free.

And, on the 247th day, it came. Israeli Defense Forces burst into the house in the Nuseirat refugee camp where Kozlov was held — a dramatic operation that rescued him and three other hostages, and killed at least 274 Palestinians caught in the cross-fire and an Israeli commando. In a moment, he was outside, feeling sun on his face for the first time in months, a Coke in his hand and a cigarette at his lips. A helicopter whirred him to safety.

“Euphoria,” he says. “You're able to feel fresh air, to see a sea, beach, sand, sky without any clouds.”

He calls it the best day of his life.

In the days that followed, he'd be reunited with his family, crumpling and bawling at his mother's feet at a hospital outside Tel Aviv, and recognized by passersby as that hostage on the news. Some nights, he'd wake up thinking he was back on that sticky mattress. Some days he had to pinch himself to believe he was truly free.

“Sometimes I feel what it means to have a war and sometimes I feel the pain of every hostage,” he says. “I feel pain of families who don't know where their loved ones are right now. ... I feel pain of people who left their houses in the south. I feel the pain of all the people who lost their houses. I feel pain.”

He says the vast majority of the time, he feels fine, but a day or so a month, the darkness returns. He spent his first few months of freedom in Israel, then traveling in the U.S. He was back in Israel for a time earlier this year, but found too many triggers, so he returned to the U.S. 

Along the way, he's made good on his goal, working on his art.

In his studio space a block from the Hudson River, he's finalizing a planned exhibition of his work — a series of mostly acrylic paintings showing his capture, captivity and release. He wants to finish a few more pieces influenced by his time as a hostage before pivoting to new inspirations.

Maybe he'll flit off to New Zealand, he says. Maybe he'll write a book. So many doors are open to him. Maybe art will become his life and his work will be filled with color and happiness.

He sees that joy even in the paintings others might insist are dark.

“It's not dark,” he says. “It's about hope.”

Fox News Digital spoke to Alabama State Auditor Andrew Sorrell about his personal experience being debanked and what states can do to stop it in the future

EXCLUSIVE: Protecting Americans from being ""debanked"" has been a top priority for the State Financial Officers Foundation, and Fox News Digital spoke to a member of that organization, who said he was targeted himself, about the importance of that pursuit. 

""When I was initially debanked, I didn't realize I was getting debanked,"" Alabama Republican State Auditor Andrew Sorrell told Fox News Digital at the State Financial Officers Foundation conference in Orlando, Florida.

""What happened was I just get a letter one day from our credit card company, from my gun store, Gold Guns and Guitars, and we get this curious letter in the mail, and it says that in 30 days, we're closing your account. And it didn't tell us why at all.""

Sorrell, 39, explained that at first he thought that his company had simply forgotten to pay their bills, but when he realized he was up-to-date, he switched credit card companies and did not think anything of it until he got another letter from his credit card processor notifying him he was being dropped.

""So we're doing about 2 million dollars in revenue, about a million and a half of that is done by credit card or debit card transactions, and I was really confused this time, because why would a credit card processor drop us?"" Sorrell explained. 

After that, Sorrell was told by his insurance company he was being dropped with ""no explanation."" 

""I called my insurance broker, and he said, ‘Oh yeah, this is happening to all gun stores,'"" Sorrell said. ""He said insurance companies are dropping all gun stores. And then it hit me. Oh my goodness, I'm a victim of political debanking. I didn't even realize that that's what was happening to me.""

Debanking is the phenomenon in which a bank customer has their accounts canceled, often with no explanation. Conservatives have long alleged that banks were unfairly targeting them in the practice, with banks specifically going after companies with conservative messaging or principles, including gun stores.

In an interview with ""Sunday Morning Futures"" anchor Maria Bartiromo, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., said he had seen ""numerous"" examples of conservatives being debanked during the Biden administration. 

""Especially people that were involved in different energy-type businesses and things like that, as well as very well-spoken and outspoken conservative activists,"" Comer said in the interview. ""So there are numerous instances, enough to open an investigation again. Is this [environmental, social and governance (ESG)] policy, which is discriminatory?""

Sorrell told Fox News Digital he is ""convinced this is happening to other people in Alabama,"" and that the problem doesn't stem from local community banks but from large national banks who were ""pushed"" by the Obama and Biden administrations. 

""I actually have some sympathy for these large banks, and I think passing debanking legislation at the state level might actually help some of these large banks, because they can go back, and they can say, I'm sorry, Alabama has now passed debanking legislation. We're just following the law, we don't wanna debank people anymore,"" Sorrell said. 

""This is un-American, and it has to be stopped.""

Since the Trump administration took office in January, pushing back against political debanking has become a more prevalent conversation in government, including in the form of a bill from GOP Sen. Tim Scott to address regulatory language that has prompted financial institutions to debank those involved in certain industries.

""It's clear that federal regulators have abused reputational risk by carrying out a political agenda against federally legal businesses,"" Scott said. ""This legislation, which eliminates references to reputational risk in regulatory supervision, is the first step once and for all.""

Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks calls out locals in Chicago for betraying their 'common sense' and voting for Mayor Brandon Johnson based on 'identity politics' instead of policy.

Chicago was plagued by violence over Memorial Day weekend when 22 people were shot, including two fatally, ABC7 reported.

One fatal shooting reportedly occurred when an argument erupted inside a vehicle on the city's Northwest Side in the Logan Square neighborhood on Saturday afternoon. The 35-year-old victim was attempting to exit the vehicle when he was shot and killed by someone else inside the vehicle. 

The shooter then fled the scene and remains at large.

The second fatal shooting took place in the same area of the city, also on Saturday afternoon, according to the report. A 46-year-old man on the Northwest Side was shot in the head while inside his vehicle near Humboldt Park. The vehicle then crashed into another car and a pole. 

The victim was transported to the hospital and later pronounced dead. The suspect in that shooting also remains at large. 

Two other people were also shot near a Humboldt Park homeless encampment, and one was critically injured. The shooter remains unidentified.

On the city's South Side, two people were sitting inside their home when they were shot. The assailant in that incident also fled the scene and remains at large.

According to the Chicago Tribune, which keeps a running tally of the number of homicides in the city each year, 139 people have been slain in the troubled city so far in 2025, based on data through May 17. The same outlet reported that 573 people were killed in Chicago in 2024. 

Last week, two Venezuelans living illegally in Chicago were arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in connection with a deadly mass shooting.

 Attorney General Pam Bondi details a DEA operation where 11.5 kilos of fentanyl, including approximately 3 million pills, were seized.

A Los Angeles County woman, who served on a presidential advisory committee under the Biden administration and has an extensive history of donating to Democrats, reached a plea agreement with the Department of Justice (DOJ) for making tens of thousands of dollars in illegal campaign contributions to reportedly secure a seat on the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees, the DOJ announced Wednesday.

Teena Maria Hostovich, 66, was charged Wednesday with making contributions in the name of another aggregating to more than $10,000 in a year, which is a felony, the DOJ reported. 

She revealed in her plea agreement that she carried out the scheme in part to secure a spot on the Kennedy Center's Board of Trustees, the DOJ stated in the press release. The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts serves as the national cultural center of the U.S. and is located in Washington, D.C.

Hostovich is an insurance broker who used the identities of 11 other people, including co-workers and family members of co-workers, to illegally contribute more than $75,000 to political candidates between 2020 and 2023, the DOJ stated in a press release. 

DOGE SAYS IT'S REFERRED DOZENS OF POTENTIAL VOTER FRAUD CASES TO DOJ

""According to her plea agreement, from May 2020 through 2023, Hostovich knowingly and willfully made a total of $75,700 in contributions to federal candidates' principal campaign committees and federal joint fundraising committees in the names of other people,"" the DOJ said in a press release. ""For the calendar years 2021 through 2023, Hostovich's conduit contributions aggregated to more than $10,000 during each of those years."" 

Hostovich agreed in a court filing Wednesday to plead guilty to the federal criminal charge and pay a $43,500 fine. 

Her scheme included contacting co-workers, their family members and other people ""who performed personal services for Hostovich and her family"" to ask them to make a donation to a political campaign or fundraising committee, according to the press release. She would then use PayPal to reimburse the individual for the contribution or pay them up front before the contribution was made, the Justice Department explained. 

STACEY ABRAMS-FOUNDED GROUPS SLAPPED WITH HISTORIC FINE FOR CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATIONS

""To execute these conduit contributions, Hostovich sometimes explicitly stated that she would advance the money for the contribution or pay the person back for that contribution,"" the press release outlined. ""Other times, the person had an implicit understanding that Hostovich would advance the money or reimburse them based on her history of advancements and reimbursements of political contributions. Hostovich generally advanced or reimbursed these individuals in amounts that exceeded the exact contribution amount but often the amounts were very close to the contribution amount.""

Fox News Digital reviewed a website promoting a book Hostovich wrote in 2024 on climbing America's corporate ladder, which also touted Hostovich as a member of the Clinton Global Initiative, and that former President Joe Biden appointed her to serve on the President's Advisory Committee on the Arts. 

""She is a member of the Clinton Global Initiative and the White House Historical Association. President Biden recently appointed her to the President's Advisory Committee for the Arts, and she is the Co-Chair of the Advisory Council to the Kennedy Center's President and Chairman,"" the bio states, which is accompanied by photos of Hostovich with high-profile Democrats such as Hillary Clinton, former President Bill Clinton and Biden.  

Fox News Digital reached out to the Clinton Foundation for comment but did not immediately receive a reply. 

An archived official White House press release from 2023 under the Biden administration detailed Hostovich's position on the President's Advisory Committee on the Arts, including touting her ""corporate governance responsibility, political activism, and philanthropic work.""

""She has combined her lifelong passion for the arts, history, and education with her corporate governance responsibility, political activism, and philanthropic work,"" the bio states. ""In addition to serving on the Board of the Los Angeles Philharmonic for over a decade, she has been one of the Chairs (along with her husband and son) of Hollywood Bowl Opening Night many times (including 2023) honoring significant artists and showcasing the LA music community while raising money for Music Matters benefitting music/arts programs in public schools."" 

It is unclear how donations made in other people's names would bolster her reported efforts to secure a spot on the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees. The president appoints general trustees to the board, while other members are appointed by Congress. 

CALIFORNIA WOMAN AND MAN CHARGED WITH ALLEGEDLY STEALING OVER $2 MILLION IN ILLEGAL COVID RELIEF FUNDS

A representative for Hostovich told Fox News Digital in an emailed statement Tuesday morning that ""Teena Hostovich has agreed to plead guilty to one count of making contributions in the name of another, involving five donations of $2,900 each in 2021. In doing so, she is accepting responsibility for her conduct early and swiftly.""

The statement continued that Hostovich's ""mistakes are out of character,"" arguing that her ""career, accomplishments, and numerous charitable deeds reflect a lifetime of hard work and generosity.""

""Her generosity and commitment to her community led to her involvement in donating and fundraising for causes and candidates that she believed would champion fairness, equality, and improve society,"" the spokesperson continued. ""She deeply regrets that her ardent support of some candidates led to lapses in judgment in a fraction of the donations she helped to raise and make. She is even more remorseful for the shadow that this investigation may cast on the candidates to whom the donations were made, as they had no knowledge of any wrongdoing."" 

""Throughout this process, Ms. Hostovich has cooperated fully and worked transparently with law enforcement authorities. She is committed to making the appropriate amends.""

The DOJ did not identify in its press release which political party Hostovich favored, though Federal Election Commission (FEC) records reviewed by Fox News show Hostovich made hundreds of donations across the years to Democrat politicians, the Democratic Party and left-wing political action committees. 

Hostovich has nearly 1,000 entries on the FEC's database regarding donations she made under her own name stretching back to 2008 through the 2024 election cycle. 

The FEC data shows she donated to campaigns and groups such as the Obama Victory Fund, Democratic Party of Virginia, Pasadena, California, area United Democratic Headquarters and Chris Coons for Delaware during the 2008–2012 period.

More recent data from the 2024 election cycle shows she donated to groups such as the North Carolina Democratic Party – Federal, the Wyoming Democratic State Central Committee, the Pennsylvania Democratic Party and the Democratic State Committee (Delaware). Searching for donations made to groups or campaigns containing the name ""Republican"" or ""GOP"" yielded zero results, Fox News Digital found.

The FBI carried out an investigation into Hostovich before she was charged and reached a plea agreement, the DOJ said. The DOJ told Fox Digital on Tuesday that Hostovich is scheduled to appear in court on June 13 in Los Angeles.

Seventh-grader Liam Morrison and his attorney Tyson Langhofer joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss why his family took legal action and how they believe the school violated his First Amendment rights. 

The Supreme Court declined to hear a case involving a Massachusetts student who was banned from school for wearing a shirt criticizing the transgender movement on Tuesday.

The student, Liam Morrison, brought the case through his father and stepmother, Christopher and Susan Morrison. The plaintiffs argue Nichols Middle School violated his free speech rights when it banned him from wearing two T-shirts to school with the words ""There are only two genders"" and ""There are [censored] genders"" on the front.

Liam was sent home both times after he refused to change shirts. The school argued the shirts made his classmates feel unsafe, and a federal court agreed, saying the message was demeaning for transgender students.

Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito both issued separate dissents, arguing the court should have taken up the case.

The decision comes nearly a year after the First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Liam and his parents in June 2024, finding that the school was justified in asking him to remove the shirt and sending him home when he refused.

Morrison, who was in seventh grade at the time, was sent home with his father in May 2023 after he refused to take off the shirt, according to court documents. He later wore the same shirt with the words ""only two"" covered with a piece of tape on which ""censored"" was written. The school also told him to take this shirt off.

In a 2023 interview with Fox News Digital, Liam stressed that his T-shirt was not directed toward anyone, specifically people who are ""lesbian or gay or transgender or anything like that.""

""I'm just voicing my opinion about a statement that I believe to be true,"" he said at the time. ""And I feel like some people may think that I'm imposing hate speech, even though it's not directed towards anyone.""

The Morrison family was represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Massachusetts Family Institute.

Fox News correspondent David Spunt and ‘Sunday Night in America with Trey Gowdy' host Trey Gowdy discuss further investigations into three unsolved DC cases on ‘America's Newsroom.' 

The FBI is taking another look at the cocaine found inside the Biden administration White House in 2023, according to Deputy Director Dan Bongino. 

""Shortly after swearing in, the Director and I evaluated a number of cases of potential public corruption that, understandably, have garnered public interest. We made the decision to either re-open, or push additional resources and investigative attention, to these cases,"" Bongino said in a post on X. 

""These cases are the DC pipe bombing investigation, the cocaine discovery at the prior administration's White House, and the leak of the Supreme Court Dobbs case. I receive requested briefings on these cases weekly and we are making progress. If you have any investigative tips on these matters that may assist us, then please contact the FBI,"" he added. 

The FBI did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request for further comment from Fox News Digital. 

TRUMP REVEALS WHO HE BELIEVES LEFT INFAMOUS BAG OF COCAINE AT WHITE HOUSE

Earlier this year, President Donald Trump said in an interview he believes former President Joe Biden or his son, Hunter Biden, left behind the infamous bag of cocaine at the White House. 

""So … who actually left the cocaine in the White House?"" The Spectator's Ben Domenech asked Trump. 

""Well, either Joe or Hunter,"" Trump responded. ""Could be Joe, too.""  

The bag of cocaine was discovered on July 2, 2023, in a storage locker near the entrance to the White House's West Wing.

The Secret Service discovered the cocaine and launched an investigation, which turned up inconclusive for a suspect. 

""On July 12, the Secret Service received the FBI's laboratory results, which did not develop latent fingerprints and insufficient DNA was present for investigative comparisons,"" it said in 2023. ""Therefore, the Secret Service is not able to compare evidence against the known pool of individuals. The FBl's evaluation of the substance also confirmed that it was cocaine.""

""That was such a terrible thing because, you know, those bins are very loaded up with … they're not clean, and they have hundreds and even thousands of fingerprints,"" Trump also said in the interview. ""And when they went to look at it, it was absolutely stone cold, wiped dry. You know that, right?"" 

The Biden family, including the former president and Hunter, were not staying at the White House when the cocaine was discovered. Instead, the family was staying at presidential retreat Camp David in Maryland.

Hunter Biden has a long and well-documented history with substance abuse, and he detailed his hourly need for crack cocaine in his 2021 memoir, ""Beautiful Things."" He has since gone through recovery efforts and has been sober since 2019, according to sworn testimony in federal court in 2023.

National Public Radio filed suit against the Trump administration on Tuesday for its move to withhold funds approved by Congress.

NPR filed the suit along with three Colorado public radio stations in response to President Donald Trump's executive order to end funding for NPR and PBS, the Public Broadcasting Service. The lawsuit states the Trump administration has gone around congressional duties to direct how federal money is spent.

“It is not always obvious when the government has acted with a retaliatory purpose in violation of the First Amendment. ‘But this wolf comes as a wolf,'” the lawsuit said. “The Order targets NPR and PBS expressly because, in the President's view, their news and other content is not ‘fair, accurate, or unbiased.'”

The lawsuit states the order “also threatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information” and that it “expressly aims to punish and control Plaintiffs' news coverage and other speech the Administration deems ‘biased.'” 

Attorneys for the news outlets wrote that the order “cannot stand.”

The lawsuit names Trump, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Maria Rosario Jackson, the chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts, as defendants. Trump and his allies have called the public broadcasters “left-wing propaganda.”

“The Executive Order is a clear violation of the Constitution and the First Amendment's protections for freedom of speech and association, and freedom of the press,” NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher said in a statement.

Every two years, Congress allocates funds for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The CPB is also suing Trump over an earlier move, in which he attempted to fire three of the five members of CPB's board of directors.

Earlier this year, the Republican-led Congress passed a stopgap budget measure to fund CPB through the end of September 2027.

FEC DISMISSES COMPLAINT AGAINST NPR ACCUSING IT OF ADVOCATING FOR HARRIS

In response to Trump's order, in which he said he was withholding CPB funding to NPR and PBS, the corporation's chief executive said the president did not have the authority to carry out such a move.

“CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the President's authority,” CPB chief Patricia Harrison, a former Republican National Committee co-chairwoman, said in a statement. “Congress directly authorized and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government.”

President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin agreed to a prisoner exchange, Russia's foreign minister said Tuesday.

“President Trump is a man who wants results,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in Turkey, according to NBC News. He did not provide further details about the exchange.

The State Department did not respond to the Washington Examiner's request to verify Russia's claim.

The exchange would be the first prisoner swap between the United States and Russia since American teacher Marc Fogel was returned to the U.S. in February after he spent more than three years in prison. 

Russia's announcement comes nearly a year after four Americans, including journalist Evan Gershkovich and former Marine Paul Whelan, who had been wrongly imprisoned in Russia, were released in August as part of a multicountry exchange. An exchange of that degree had not been seen since the Cold War.

Trump, who repeatedly said he would end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours of starting his presidency — he now suggests that was an exaggeration — has in recent weeks pushed for an immediate 30-day ceasefire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has also expressed his support for this plan, but Putin has said he wants to talk first. 

PUTIN IS A NO-SHOW IN TURKEY FOR PEACE TALKS, BUT TRUMP SAYS HE HOPES RUSSIA AND UKRAINE CAN ‘DO SOMETHING'

Putin had called for peace talks in Turkey earlier this month, but he did not show up and instead sent a low-level delegation. Russia also has not backed down from its list of demands.

Trump has expressed frustration with Putin due to the Russian military's increased attacks on Ukrainian civilian areas. The pair spoke on the phone for over two hours last week to discuss a ceasefire.

The left-wing advocacy organization Southern Poverty Law Center listed the conservative Republican activist group Turning Point USA in its “2024 Year in Hate and Extremism Report.”

Under the subsection “Dismantling White Supremacy,” the SPLC included a report titled “Turning Point USA: A case study of the hard right in 2024.” 

Describing Turning Point Action as a “well-funded, hard-right organization with links to Southern Poverty Law Center-identified hard-right extremists and a tremendous amount of influence in conservative politics,” the SPLC provided multiple examples to justify its classification of Turning Point Action in its report. The organization was particularly critical of Turning Point Founder Charlie Kirk. 

“Kirk accused Democrats of embracing immigration as part of their plot to secure voters, permit crime and enact the ‘great replacement,'” read the report. “He warned his hundreds of thousands of listeners, ‘We native born Americans are being replaced by foreigners.' He then promised Trump will ‘liberate' the country from ‘the enemy occupation of the foreigner hordes.'”

Kirk blasted the SPLC's report in a post on X. 

The SPLC has added Turning Point to their ridiculous “hate group” list, right next to the KKK and neo-Nazis, a cheap smear from a washed-up org that's been fleecing scared grandmas for decades. They somehow still rake in over $100 million a year peddling their “hate map”…

“The SPLC has added Turning Point to their ridiculous ‘hate group' list, right next to the KKK and neo-Nazis, a cheap smear from a washed-up org that's been fleecing scared grandmas for decades,” Kirk said. “They somehow still rake in over $100 million a year peddling their ‘hate map' nonsense, sitting pretty in their Montgomery ‘Poverty Palace' while crying about ‘hate' to line their pockets. Even former staffers called their racket a ‘con.'”

“But it's 2025, and nobody with a functioning brain buys their garbage anymore,” Kirk added. “The SPLC is a laughingstock, a hollowed-out husk of an organization that's been exposed as a grift time and time again. They're not just irrelevant — they're a cautionary tale of how to torch your own credibility. Maybe someone should take a hard look at where all that ‘nonprofit' money's really going?”

Presidential adviser and SpaceX founder Elon Musk also chimed in, criticizing the SPLC.

SPLC is a scam organization

“SPLC is a scam organization,” Musk posted.

The left-wing organization also claimed that Kirk's organization is at the “forefront” of promoting “Christian nationalism” in its explanation for adding TPUSA to the list. The specific list the SPLC placed Turning Point USA on includes chapters of the Ku Klux Klan, as Tyler O'Neil, senior editor of the Daily Signal, pointed out.

🚨BREAKINGThe Southern Poverty Law Center, which trades on its history bankrupting the KKK to smear conservatives as secret supporters of ""white supremacy,"" has put the largest conservative youth org—@TPUSA—on the ""hate map"" with Klan chapters.🧵1/15https://t.co/1wIU6FX0m6 pic.twitter.com/pCc3vIm55A

“TPUSA is at the forefront of the movement to promote Christian nationalism, the theocratic worldview that the U.S. is a fundamentally Christian country and that Christian values and beliefs should inform the government and wider culture,” read the SPLC's report.

THE SINISTER PLOT TO PUNISH POLITICAL FREE SPEECH

Kirk dismissed the SPLC's categorization of his organization and, like Musk, called the SPLC a “scam.”

“Being on their list is a badge of honor,” Kirk said. “It means they're terrified that we're so effective. Keep crying, SPLC—America's done with your scam.”

‘HE HAS GONE ABSOLUTELY CRAZY!': Taking advantage of the lack of U.S. and European resolve, Russian President Vladimir Putin has dramatically intensified his aerial attacks on Ukraine, hoping for a knockout blow, thanks to Russia's increased production of Shahed drones, reportedly up to 100 a day.

Russia launched three nights of strikes over the Memorial Day weekend, firing more than 900 drones and missiles in what Ukraine called an “increasingly brazen and large-scale” assault on five key cities, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Odesa.

On Sunday, as the scale of the carnage was unfolding, President Donald Trump was incredulous. “I'm not happy with what Putin's doing. He's killing a lot of people and I don't know what the hell happened to Putin. I've known him a long time, always gotten along with him, but he's sending rockets into cities and killing people and I don't like it at all,” Trump told reporters at the airport in Morristown, New Jersey. “We're in the middle of talking and he's shooting rockets into Kyiv and other cities. I don't like it at all.”

Later on Truth Social, Trump posted, “Something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY! He is needlessly killing a lot of people, and I'm not just talking about soldiers. Missiles and drones are being shot into Cities in Ukraine, for no reason whatsoever. I've always said that he wants ALL of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that's proving to be right, but if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia!”

RESTRICTIONS LIFTED ON UKRAINE FIRING LONG-RANGE MISSILES AFTER MASSIVE RUSSIAN DRONE ATTACK

‘IT IS A TIME FOR HONESTY': While Trump was questioning, “What the hell happened to Putin,” Ukraine supporters in Congress were asking a different question: “When is Trump going to realize that Putin has no intention of ending the war until he gets everything he wants?”

“It is a time for honesty. Peace talks are having zero effect on Putin,” Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE), a retired Air Force one-star general, posted on X. “His goal is to dominate Ukraine & he won't stop until he realizes he cannot win. The U.S. & Allies must arm Ukraine to the teeth, sanction Russia to the max, & confiscate the $300B in overseas Russian assets.”

“I've had enuf of Putin killing innocent ppl,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) posted last night. “Pres Trump Take action AT LEAST SANCTIONS.”

“It is clear to me that after all these months, the earnest efforts by President Trump are not being equally met,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) in a Senate floor speech last week. “It is now time to increase the cost of this war to Putin. The sanctions package we have put together has [over] 80 cosponsors. Do you know how hard it is to get 80 Senators to agree on anything? Eighty of us — and the number is climbing — are ready to impose sanctions on Russia if Putin does not come to the table and earnestly seek peace.”

GRASSLEY IMPLORES TRUMP TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA

ZELENSKY: ‘AMERICA'S SILENCE … ONLY ENCOURAGES PUTIN': Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky poked Trump Sunday morning in a post on Telegram, resulting in Trump lashing out in his Sunday evening post.

“The world may go on vacation, but the war continues, despite weekends and weekdays. This cannot be ignored. America's silence, and the silence of others in the world, only encourages Putin,” Zelensky said, infuriating Trump.

“President Zelenskyy is doing his Country no favors by talking the way he does,” Trump said. “Everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don't like it, and it better stop.”

In his nightly video address, Zelensky cited what he called “information obtained by intelligence and from open-source data,” showing that “Putin and his entourage” have no plans to end the war anytime soon. 

“There is currently no indication that they are seriously considering peace or diplomacy. On the contrary, there is ample evidence that they are preparing new offensive operations. Russia is counting on a prolonged war,” Zelensky said. “Russians are supposedly drafting proposals for a memorandum on peace. They've already spent over a week on this. They talk a lot about diplomacy. But when, in the midst of all that, there are constant Russian strikes, constant killings, relentless assaults, and even preparations for new offensives.”

HAPPENING TODAY: NEW ‘PHYSICAL CONTROL MEASURES': The initial announcement on X from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seemed innocuous enough. “We're announcing additional credentialing procedures for the press at the Pentagon in the interest of national security.” However, the attached memo outlined a series of restrictions on Pentagon reporters that upended decades of openness and transparency that allowed the press access to civilian and military personnel.

Since its construction during World War II, the Pentagon has been unique among military headquarters in that it allows reporters to have offices in the building and to move freely through its 17 and 1/2 miles of corridors to speak with sources both on and off the record.

The new policies, dubbed “Updated Physical Control Measures for Press/Media Access Within the Pentagon,” bar reporters from large areas of the building without an escort and give them less freedom of movement than “maintenance staff of concessions workers,” as the Pentagon Press Association pointed out in a statement decrying the new restrictions.

“Up until now, the press could wander all around the Pentagon with no oversight. Even outside of sensitive/classified areas. So moving forward, they'll need an escort to access those areas,” Sean Parnell, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said on X. “They still have access to the entire defense press office, the press secretary & my office, as well as much of the rest of the building. These are pragmatic changes to protect operational security & ultimately brings the Pentagon in line with other government buildings.”

The new rules are designed to “reduce the opportunities for in-person inadvertent and unauthorized disclosures,” in other words, running into someone in the hallway, one of the primary ways reporters gather news at the Pentagon. The beat has always been one that was covered by walking around. 

“There is no way to sugarcoat it,” the Pentagon Press Association said in its statement. “Today's memo … appears to be a direct attack on the freedom of the press and America's right to know what its military is doing.”

“The PPA is puzzled why the DOD is devoting such attention to restricting Pentagon media instead of engaging with it as senior leaders have long done.” The Pentagon has dispatched with a long tradition of weekly press briefings at the Pentagon, and Hegseth has yet to appear in the Pentagon briefing room to take questions from reporters.

The memo outlining the new restrictions includes a potentially chilling requirement that reporters will be required to sign a form acknowledging their responsibility to protect “classified national intelligence information,” as well as “sensitive, unclassified information,” which could be anything the Pentagon would prefer not be reported.

“I don't know if I'll be telling you anything good or bad over the next two days but I have a feeling I might be telling you something good. We've had some real progress, serious progress,” Trump said. “I'd love to see no bombs dropped and a lot of people dead. I really would like to see that happen, and I think there's a good chance that it could happen.”

Centrist Republicans are said to be worried that the reconciliation bill's proposed cuts to Medicaid spending will leave them vulnerable to Democratic attacks. They are right to be concerned, but they can rest more easily if only they realize that they, not the Democrats, hold the moral high ground on this issue.

That conclusion might strike some readers as strange. It's well established that swing voters do not like to see people lose their health insurance, even if doing so would save taxpayers money.

This basic moral fact is at the heart of traditionally successful Democratic messaging on Republican healthcare policy.

The 2012 attack on former Rep. Paul Ryan's (R-WI) proposed change to Medicare is a case in point. Ryan wanted to transform Medicare from a fee-for-service program to one that provided a set subsidy for each senior citizen to buy their own health insurance. 

Democrats seized on the uncertainty that the proposal inherently created. Would the amount be enough to get everyone the healthcare they need in retirement? Ryan could never effectively answer that challenge. His claim that the free market would provide cost-effective policies struck many seniors as fanciful and uncertain. Better the fee-for-service bird-in-hand than the premium support two birds in the bush.

That basic moral dilemma is what made the famous “pushing grandma over the cliff” ad impactful. The fact that grandma might lose her healthcare, or see her coverage diminished, through no fault of her own, was viewed by many voters outside the GOP base as immoral and unfair.

The same moral dynamic was at play in the 2018 midterms. The Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare threatened to remove one of that scheme's popular provisions, the requirement that insurance plans cover all applicants for the same price regardless of their pre-existing medical conditions.

One can argue that sicker people should have to pay more for their coverage under a free market system. One can also argue that insurers should not be forced to cover treatment for conditions that did not arise while the applicant was contracted to the insurer.

But those market-based arguments strike most voters as immoral. Americans largely believe that health insurance should cover people for whatever illness they have, regardless of when or how they acquired them. They prefer, in this case, security over liberty.

Democrats based their 2018 midterm campaign on this theme, picking up 41 House seats. 

Centrists are afraid the Medicaid spending cuts will trigger a similar outcome, but that's comparing apples to oranges.

The bulk of the spending cuts in the reconciliation bill come from a provision that requires able-bodied adult Medicaid recipients under 65 to work, take classes, or do community service for at least 20 hours a week. Recipients with dependent young children, among others, are exempt from this mandate.

This provision is popular with voters of all stripes. According to a February poll, 62% of voters, including a majority of independents, back the bill's work effort requirements.

It's easy to understand why. People believe that government benefits should go hand in hand with effort to help oneself and contribute to society. The work effort requirements do just that.

The cuts in spending flowing from this proposal are the result of estimates that many people will not comply. In this case, it's easy for threatened members to argue that that's their own fault – people lose Medicaid coverage only if they can't even make the effort to try to contribute to their own well-being.

That's a very different moral case than the one underlying the typical Democratic healthcare attack. 

Other proposed Medicaid spending changes rest on similarly sound moral ground. A provision that penalizes states that spend their own money on providing health insurance to illegal aliens is an example.

Trump voters don't think illegal aliens should be in the country at all, much less get taxpayer-subsidized health insurance. The bill's provisions might lead some states to withdraw or limit coverage for those people, but voters open to backing Republicans won't see that as unfair.

These avenues of response will require members to get out of their comfort zone a bit. They will have to explain what's really in the bill and spend money to air television ads doing so. It's understandable they would prefer not to have to do this at all — that's an easier course to take.

But they also know that Republican voters are tired of spending money for benefits for scroungers and illegals. Many members from safe districts know this, so they are pushing so hard to ensure these provisions are in the final bill.

THE LAST-MINUTE CHANGES MADE TO THE TAX BILL TO WIN OVER HOLDOUT REPUBLICANS

The fact is that both sides rest on sound political ground. The GOP base wants spending cuts and the way the bill does it is morally acceptable to swing voters. 

Centrists should rest assured that if they stand up to fight this point in their re-elections, they are very likely to win the battle with the public.

American weapons are important, but Ukrainian drones have changed everything.

Since entering office in January, President Donald Trump has pressed for a negotiated settlement to the war in Ukraine, largely on Russian terms. “You don't have the cards right now,” Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in their infamous February Oval Office meeting—suggesting that Ukraine could resist a Russian takeover only with continued American military backing or Russia's voluntary restraint.

Anne Applebaum: Nobody in Ukraine thinks the war will end soon

Watch: The war in Ukraine enters its fourth year

At one of the brigade's tactical operation centers, a room where one battalion monitors its territory across a multiscreen display with maps, I watched black-and-white aerial footage of Ukrainian attack drones striking a Russian dugout in the forest. A battalion commander who went by the call name Zhyvchyk—“Zest” in Ukrainian—told me that more than 18 Russian soldiers had surrendered to his battalion in the previous month. In one incident captured on video, a Russian soldier threw a grenade into his commander's dugout before surrendering. He told the reconnaissance unit that his commanders were receiving air-dropped food parcels that they weren't sharing with subordinates.

The Ukrainian military has developed a battlefield-management system called Delta, which integrates information from reconnaissance, drones, satellite imagery, and intelligence. Khartiia is considered one of the most technologically savvy units, with the best analytics: Its Delta map is marked with symbols and colors that differentiate among active Ukrainian and Russian dugouts, showing which have been smashed or overtaken so that drone pilots can make quick decisions and avoid wasting drones.

The drones themselves run a gamut of cost and lethality. FPV (or first-person-view) drones, informally known as kamikazes because they destroy themselves, are the cheapest, starting at $350. Among the more expensive drones are bombers, which drop explosives for air strikes or remote land-mining and can be used multiple times. Operating them is more dangerous than the kamikazes: They need to return to their pilots for reloading, so the operators' positions risk being spotted.

In 2022, all operations involved artillery, armed vehicles, and infantry. The major battles were about controlling height to observe more and react faster. In all three categories, Russia surpassed Ukraine. To support artillery so they are more precise, we started using observation drones, called “wedding drones,” which photographers often use at weddings. Later, we started using kamikaze drones and bombers. Then the land drones appeared, tasked with delivering and even evacuating the wounded. In 2022, it was still possible to create trenches in the field and successfully defend them. Today, being there means death for 100 percent of people. Nobody any longer pursues mass attacks using armored vehicles, as they'd be destroyed before they approach the front line. The infantry creates its positions when the drones cannot see it.

The Trump administration has launched an attack on knowledge itself.

Updated at 1:13 p.m. ET on May 27, 2025

The warlords who sacked Rome did not intend to doom Western Europe to centuries of ignorance. It was not a foreseeable consequence of their actions. The same cannot be said of the sweeping attack on human knowledge and progress that the Trump administration is now undertaking—a deliberate destruction of education, science, and history, conducted with a fanaticism that recalls the Dark Ages that followed Rome's fall.

Every week brings fresh examples. The administration is threatening colleges and universities with the loss of federal funding if they do not submit to its demands, or even if they do. The engines of American scientific inquiry and ingenuity, such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, are under sustained attack. Historical institutions such as the Smithsonian and artistic ones like the Kennedy Center are being converted into homes for MAGA ideology rather than historical fact and free expression. Libraries are losing funding, government-employed scientists are being dismissed from their jobs, educators are being cowed into silence, and researchers are being warned not to broach forbidden subjects. Entire databases of public-health information collected over decades are at risk of vanishing. Any facts that contradict the gospel of Trumpism are treated as heretical.

These various initiatives and policy changes are often regarded as discrete problems, but they comprise a unified assault. The Trump administration has launched a comprehensive attack on knowledge itself, a war against culture, history, and science. If this assault is successful, it will undermine Americans' ability to comprehend the world around us. Like the inquisitors of old, who persecuted Galileo for daring to notice that the sun did not, in fact, revolve around the Earth, they believe that truth-seeking imperils their hold on power.

By destroying knowledge, Trumpists seek to make the country more amenable to their political domination, and to prevent meaningful democratic checks on their behavior. Their victory, though, would do much more than that. It would annihilate some of the most effective systems for aggregating, accumulating, and applying human knowledge that have ever existed. Without those systems, America could find itself plunged into a new Dark Age.

Perhaps the most prominent targets of the attack on knowledge have been America's institutions of higher education. Elite colleges and universities have lost billions of dollars in federal funding. Cornell has had more than $1 billion frozen, Princeton had $210 million suspended, and Northwestern lost access to nearly $800 million. In some cases, the freezes weren't connected to specific demands; the funding was simply revoked outright. Johns Hopkins University is reeling from losing $800 million in grants, which will force the top recipient of federal research dollars to “plan layoffs and cancel health projects, from breast-feeding support efforts in Baltimore to mosquito-net programs in Mozambique,” The Wall Street Journal reported.

Juliette Kayyem: This tornado mayhem is a warning

In some cases, the administration has made specific demands that institutions adhere to Trumpist ideology in what they teach and whom they hire, or face a loss of funding. Some schools are fighting back—Harvard, for example, is suing to retain its independence. “No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” Harvard's president said in a statement.

The Trump administration's purge of forbidden texts and ideas at West Point offers a glimpse of what its ideal university might look like. At the military academy, The New York Times reported, leadership “initiated a schoolwide push to remove any readings that focused on race, gender or the darker moments of American history.” A professor who “leads a course on genocide was instructed not to mention atrocities committed against Native Americans, according to several academy officials. The English department purged works by well-known Black authors, such as Toni Morrison, James Baldwin and Ta-Nehisi Coates.”

Some institutions have tried to appease the administration. Columbia University, which agreed to Trump's orders in an effort to retain $400 million in federal funding, discovered the hard way that deals with the president aren't worth the sweat from the handshake. After Columbia acceded to Trump's demands, the administration reportedly began considering new ones, including potentially requiring the school to submit to a judicially enforced consent decree that would prolong the government's control over the institution.

The money these institutions have lost (or could still lose) is not merely symbolic. Federal grants fund research, scholarship, and archival work on college campuses. Without this money—unless schools raise the funds from other sources—labs and departments will close. The right-wing activist Chris Rufo recently told The New York Times that in addition to using funding to force universities to teach or adhere to conservative dogma, he would like to “reduce the size of the sector itself.” Students will have fewer opportunities. Research in many fields will be put on indefinite pause. America will make fewer scientific breakthroughs.

The Trump administration's attack on knowledge is not limited to academia, however. Across the government, workers whose job is to research, investigate, or analyze have lost funding or been fired.

These are people who do the crucial work of informing Americans about about and protecting them from diseases, natural disasters, and other threats to their health. Thousands of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been let go, including most of those whose job it is to maintain workplace safety standards. Experts at the Food and Drug Administration including, according to the Times, “lab scientists who tested food and drugs for contaminants or deadly bacteria; veterinary division specialists investigating bird flu transmission; and researchers who monitored televised ads for false claims about prescription drugs” have been purged. Workers in the Department of Agriculture's U.S. Forest Service research team, who develop “tools to model fire risk, markets, forest restoration and water,” have been targeted for layoffs. The Environmental Protection Agency's entire research arm is being “eliminated.” The administration has made “deep cuts” to the Department of Education's research division.

The most devastating cuts may be those to the government's scientific-research agencies, such as the NIH and NSF. According to CBS News, since January, more than $2 billion has been cut from NIH and 1,300 employees have been fired. One former NIH employee told CBS that “work on child cancer therapies, dementia, and stroke slowed or stopped because critical lab and support staff were let go.” The administration is also trying to halt financial support for projects that commit wrongthink, and has already drastically reduced the number of NSF grants.

The scientific journal Nature reported that Trump intends to cut both staff and funding for the NSF by 50 percent or more, especially those grants that fund studies of marginalized groups, dismissing such awards as “DEI.” Hundreds of grants have already been canceled. NASA, the CDC, the EPA, and the Department of Energy would all lose significant funds as well. Staffers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been fired, hampering states' ability to prepare for national disasters and endangering the basic weather reports used by everyone.

Also gone are years' worth of public-health data, which, as my colleague Katherine J. Wu has reported, have been removed as part of the “ongoing attempt to scrub federal agencies of any mention of gender, DEI, and accessibility.” This includes both previously published research and works in progress. According to Nature, “NIH staff members have been instructed to identify and potentially cancel grants for projects studying transgender populations, gender identity, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the scientific workforce,” or “environmental justice.” At the Department of Health and Human Services, the Associated Press reported, Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appears to have eliminated more than a dozen “data-gathering programs that track deaths and disease,” which, perhaps not coincidentally, will make evaluating his destructive tenure more difficult.

“Not being able to study a problem doesn't mean that the problem doesn't exist,” one public-health professional (who requested anonymity because they did not want their organization to become a target) told me. “It only means that we don't know if it exists or not, because we don't have the relevant data.”

Trump has sought to justify these cuts by exploiting Americans' bigotry or ignorance—for example, during his address to Congress in March, the president complained about government funds for research on “making mice transgender.” It's unclear whether Trump was referring to “transgenic mice,” whose DNA is altered for scientific-research purposes and which are common especially in medical research, or to mice treated with sex hormones for the purpose of studying their effects on certain diseases or treatments. But the clear purpose of such misleading descriptions is to hide the gravity of what is being stolen from the American people by pretending that it has no value.

The first-order effects of the attack on knowledge will be the diminution of American science and, with it, a decline in the sorts of technological achievements that have improved lives over the past century. Modern agriculture and medicine were built on the foundation of federally funded research. Many of the most prominent advances in information technology were also made with government support, including the internet, GPS, and touch screens.

For the past century, state-funded advances have been the rule rather than the exception. Private-sector innovation can take off after an invention becomes profitable, but the research that leads to that invention tends to be a costly gamble—for this reason, the government often takes on the initial risk that private firms cannot. Commercial flight, radar, microchips, spaceflight, advanced prosthetics, lactose-free milk, MRI machines—the list of government-supported research triumphs is practically endless. To the extent that private-sector research can even begin to fill the gap, such research is beholden to corporations' bottom line. Exxon Mobil knew climate change was real decades ago, and nevertheless used its influence to raise doubt about findings it knew were accurate.

But a massive technological stall is only the most apparent aspect of the coming damage. The attack on knowledge also threatens the country's ability to address subtler social problems, such as racial and economic inequalities in health, opportunity, and civil rights. Research into these disparities is being cut across government and civil society in the name of defeating so-called wokeness. Invoked as a general criticism of left-wing excess, the fight against “wokeness” is destroying huge swaths of scholarship and research, for fear the results might make the case for racial or gender equality, the redistribution of wealth, or the regulation of industry. The very slipperiness of the term makes it useful in dismissing work that would yield significant public benefits as inconsequential.

But it's hard to address problems that have a disparate impact without paying attention to disparities. “I'm talking about narrowing the maternal mortality gap. I'm talking about basic research on long COVID,” Phillip Atiba Solomon, a professor of African American studies and psychology at Yale, told me. In his view, this stems from the administration's ideological discomfort with the facts of this world, and the conclusions scholars draw from them. “It turns out that when you pay close attention to these issues, you don't end up where they end up,” he added. “So they've had to manufacture their own facts, and they're attacking the places that have the facts on the ground and the reality of history.”

The Trumpist campaign against American history in schools and museums reflects the same impulse. The administration issued an executive order to coerce K–12 public schools into teaching a distorted, one-sided view of American history that excludes or whitewashes its darker episodes. During her confirmation hearing, Education Secretary Linda McMahon declined to say whether teaching a Black-history class would be legal under the order. Another executive order attacked the “distorted narrative” of American history at the Smithsonian Institution, citing an exhibition that mentioned that “societies including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement,” an objective description of centuries of chattel slavery followed by Jim Crow.

The Trump administration is also trying to slash grants made by the National Endowment for the Humanities, which supports research, libraries, and museums across the country. Libraries are losing grants from the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services as well. In early May, Trump fired Carla Hayden, the first Black woman to run the Library of Congress, part of a pattern of purging women and Black people from leadership positions. Given that the Library of Congress is responsible for providing research to lawmakers, the move was even more sinister than it might seem—the Trump administration is trying to control the flow of information not only to the public, but to the government itself.

A Black-history museum in Boston—located in a meetinghouse where the abolitionists Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison once lectured—is in danger now that its federal grant was terminated on the grounds that it “no longer align[s] with the White House policies.” Trump has also threatened the Smithsonian over descriptions of exhibitions that contradict right-wing dogma, including one at the American Art Museum that stated, “Race is not a biological reality but a social construct.” That race is a malleable social construct and not a biological reality is a matter of genetic science, but one that contradicts the Trump administration's implicit belief that social inequalities stem from the inherent capabilities of different groups rather than discrimination or public policy.

Further destruction is still coming. Of particular concern is the risk that the administration will manipulate economic data to hide the disastrous effects of Trump's policies. The administration has floated separating government spending from GDP estimates, an attempt to conceal the negative economic impact of the needless and unlawful layoffs being carried out by Elon Musk under the auspices of DOGE. During Democratic administrations, Trump has—completely without evidence—accused federal agencies of faking economic data. If the usual pattern of Trump doing things he accuses others of doing holds, Trump himself may try to fake economic data for real. As The New York Times reported, remarks by Trump officials have “renewed concerns that the new administration could seek to interfere with federal statistics—especially if they start to show that the economy is slipping into a recession.”

Objective economic data have become even more important given Trump's ruinous attempt to replace the income tax—a windfall for the rich—with tariffs. Trump reversed course on some of his recent tariffs last month once bond yields began to rise steeply, an indication of impending catastrophe. Avoiding such a catastrophe requires unimpeachable data, but should one occur, the Trump administration may decide that political survival requires lying. Such lies are more effective without the data to contest them.

The reasons for this wholesale destruction are as ideological as they are short-sighted. Conservatives have made no secret of their hostility toward higher education and academia. In 2021, as my colleague Yair Rosenberg recently noted, J. D. Vance, then a Senate candidate, gave an address in which he quoted Richard Nixon saying, “The professors are the enemy,” and laid out his belief that colleges and universities “make it impossible for conservative ideas to ultimately carry the day.”

Vance's premise is falsified by the simple existence of the second Trump administration. But it also reveals the administration's apparent objective, which is to destroy the ability to discover, accumulate, or present any knowledge that could be used to oppose Trumpism. Although Vance couched his objections in terms of universities teaching dogma instead of “truth,” the administration's recent actions suggest it believes that the only truth is Trumpist dogma. “The voting patterns of most university professors,” Vance posted on X over Memorial Day weekend, “are so one-sided that they look like election results in North Korea.” A MAGA re-education to impart the correct political beliefs is demanded.

Workers must be disciplined, the media must be silenced, schools must be brought under political control, and research institutions must not broach forbidden topics. Information that might contain the seed of political opposition—that might interfere with conservative ideas carrying the day—must be suppressed.

Last month, the administration cut a climate-change research grant awarded to Princeton for fear it would give children “climate anxiety.” In a statement calling for the defunding of NPR and PBS, the White House complained about a story correctly describing banana slugs as hermaphrodites, describing it as “woke propaganda.” When American intelligence analysts conveyed their view that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was not a state actor and was not “invading” the United States, some were fired while others were told to “rethink” the analysis—to cook the books for the administration in order to justify its lawless deportation program. As the journalist Spencer Ackerman notes, this is exactly the kind of thing that led America into the disastrous invasion of Iraq.

The attack on knowledge is disproportionately an attack on knowledge workers, the part of the white-collar workforce employed in some kind of research, archival, or instructional work. Less funding for scholarly and scientific institutions will mean fewer researchers, analysts, scholars, and scientists. It will mean fewer institutions capable of employing white-collar workers. Fewer people will go to college, and there will be fewer opportunities after graduation for those who do.

Additionally, the Trump administration wants to see fewer underrepresented minorities in these professions—some of its largest cuts have been not only to research focusing on minority groups, but to programs designed to increase the number of students from underrepresented backgrounds in science, technology, engineering, and math professions. The Trump administration wants fewer highly educated workers, and it wants them as a group to be whiter and from wealthier families.

Trump and his allies see highly educated people, in the aggregate, as a kind of class enemy of the MAGA project. Highly educated voters have trended leftward in recent elections, a phenomenon that has not-so-coincidentally appeared alongside the conservative movement's growing conviction that higher education must be brought under right-wing political control. In short, destroying American universities will also limit the growth of a Democratic-trending constituency—fewer educated voters will translate to fewer Democrats in office. The tech barons supporting Trump have companies that rely on educated workers, but they want submissive toilers, not active citizens who might conceive of their interests as being different from those of their bosses.

A formal education does not immunize anyone against adopting false beliefs, but two things are true: Many of Trump's supporters have come to see knowledge-producing institutions and the people who work for them as sources of liberal indoctrination that must be brought to heel or destroyed, and they do not want Americans trusting any sources of authority that are not Trump-aligned. This is of a piece with Trump's longtime strategy regarding the media, which, as he told CBS News in 2018, is “to discredit you all and demean you all so when you write negative stories about me, no one will believe you.”

In the same 2021 speech, Vance declared, “We have got to get out of the mindset that the only way to live a good life in this country, the only way for our children to succeed, is to go to a four-year university, where people will learn to hate their country and acquire a lot of debt in the process.” This point, on its own, is correct. Having a college degree should not be necessary for fulfilling and gainful employment. But wrecking America's scholarly and research institutions will not improve the lives of blue-collar workers. If anything improves as a result, it will be the MAGA right's own political dominance and the wealth of its benefactors, who will have successfully destroyed public services while slashing their own taxes and the regulations that constrain their corporations, and rewarding themselves with government contracts.

In March, The Washington Post reported that the Trump administration was “moving to privatize a sweeping number of government functions and assets—a long-standing Republican goal that's being catalyzed by billionaire Elon Musk.” Part of this effort will be to replace human workers with large language models, or artificial intelligence,” automating parts of the federal government with an untested technology that amounts to a bailout for the private companies that have developed AI without finding a profitable use for it. This will make government functions worse, but it will help sustain investment and profitability for the wealthy investors backing the technology. Like most other IT technologies, of course, AI was developed with support from the same federal agencies that the tech barons are now helping dismantle.

The extent of this looting will be difficult to determine, because in effect, the attack on knowledge is also an attack on political accountability. Accountability requires information. The public must know what is happening if it is ever going to demand change. But without information about what the government is doing, the administration and MAGA more generally will entrench themselves, such that their corruption, destruction, and mismanagement can occur without oversight or risk of a public reckoning.

Notwithstanding Musk's insistence that he is reducing “waste, fraud, and abuse” in the government, the Trump administration has been gutting the very institutions charged with gathering information about what the government does—not just with finding wrongdoing or inefficiency, but with preserving its own records and those produced by investigations of private firms. In early February, Trump fired the head of the National Archives. The damage that would be caused by manipulation or destruction of historical records could be irreversible.

The future record is perhaps at even greater risk. Those past records must be actively destroyed, whereas records of what the government does from now on may simply never be made. The Trump administration has unlawfully fired inspectors general who have done government-accountability work in the past, while taking aim at regulatory agencies responsible for oversight of industry, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whose investigations are important not only because they protect investors and consumers but because they produce records of corporate misconduct. The administration has also taken aim at the independence of the Securities and Exchange Commission, closing more than 100 ongoing investigations. All of this ruins the government's capacity not only to learn how to make itself better, but to monitor the health of financial markets and root out corporate malfeasance.

But corporate misconduct is not the only kind of misconduct, and the Trump administration has also targeted other forms of record-keeping on government abuse, including a database of federal law-enforcement officials who have been fired, sued, or convicted of wrongdoing. The Trump administration removed the database, The Appeal reported. In other words, the Trump administration has deliberately made it easier for bad cops to keep finding work as officers. In key institutions that determine how and when the government uses force, such as the Pentagon and the Justice Department, the administration has been firing lawyers whose troublesome legal advice might prevent the president from committing crimes or who might provide records of the decision to do so. The logic is that of the Mafia—no body, no evidence, no crime.

John Q. Barrett, a law professor at St. Johns University who worked in the Department of Justice's inspector general's office in the 1990s, offered me a couple of examples of the kind of corruption and abuse that the office uncovered. In one instance, the IG discovered that FBI crime labs had mishandled forensic evidence for years, including “significant instances of testimonial errors, substandard analytical work and deficient practices.” In another, an IG report found that Bureau of Prisons officials were taking bribes to facilitate drug smuggling and organized crime. Yet another IG investigation found that immigration officials were manipulating statistics to make it seem like they were more successful in deterring illegal immigration than they actually were.

Barrett emphasized that the attack on knowledge will encourage more waste, fraud, and abuse in government. “Sometimes,” he said, referring to when he worked in the inspector general's office, “there were big-dollar savings; sometimes there were big program mismanagement, identifications, and corrections. Sometimes it was just making people sit up straighter and remember to meet their responsibilities.” Under Trump, he warned, “I think lots of petty corruption will flourish. People do engage in petty corruption, but when they get caught, that deters everybody else on their corridor from basic stuff like per diem fraud and voucher fraud and travel-expense padding.”

If Trump were actively trying to facilitate such petty corruption, it would be hard to see what he would do differently. “What they've done is to effectively neuter the institutions that were created to do exactly what they say Musk and DOGE are doing,” Michael Bromwich, a former Department of Justice inspector general who in the 1990s uncovered significant problems at an FBI crime lab that forced the bureau to review hundreds of cases, told me. “You would do that because you want to control the criticism of your appointees, your secretaries of defense, of state, of labor. You would do that because you don't want to subject them to written criticism that's contained in both the semiannual reports and the audit, inspection, and investigation reports. You would do that because you want to be able to do things in secret, and you want to be able to do them in a way that's unverifiable.”

Trump's attack on knowledge will harm not just the so-called elites he and his allies are punishing. The long-term price of solidifying their power in this way will be high—perhaps even higher than Trumpism's wealthy benefactors expect. One obvious cost is the damage to technological, scientific, and social advancement. Another will be the impossibility of self-governance, because a public denied access to empirical reality cannot engage in self-determination as the Founders imagined.

“We've been having a conversation about who should be the arbiter of truth online for some time, because misinformation was such a major issue, all the way dating back to 2016 and before,” Atiba Solomon, the Yale professor, told me. “And I feel like now it's not just who's the arbiter of truth online; it's who's going to be the arbiter of truth in the public, formal record. That's what's at stake here in terms of long-term stuff. You're not just talking about uncomfortable lacunae in the knowledge-production process. You're talking about the possibility of a knowledge-production process.”

A population dependent on whatever engagement-seeking nonsense is fed to them on a manipulated social-media network is one that is much easier to exploit and control. By destroying knowledge, including the very scholarship that would study the effects of the administration's policies on society, the Trump administration and its allies can ensure that their looting of the federal government and public goods can never be fully rectified or punished.

For Trump and his allies, this large-scale destruction of the knowledge-production process could be quite lucrative in the short term. Some examples of this, such as Musk using his influence to secure himself federal contracts and the administration removing regulations on pollution on behalf of Trump's oil-industry allies, are obvious. But fewer restraints on business means more corporations getting away with scamming and exploiting their customers, and more money for unscrupulous hucksters like those surrounding the president.

The disappearance of high-quality empirical evidence means not only fewer rebuttals of right-wing dogmas, but also a bigger market for wellness pseudoscience and other scams—such as Kennedy's imbecilic suggestion to treat the growing measles outbreak in the Southwest with cod-liver oil. America under Trump is rejecting one of the most effective health-care infrastructures in human history and embracing woo-woo nonsense on par with medieval doctors measuring the four humors.

The book burnings of the past had physical limitations; after all, only the books themselves could be destroyed. The Trumpist attack on knowledge, by contrast, threatens not just accumulated knowledge, but also the ability to collect such knowledge in the future. Any pursuit of forbidden ideas, after all, might foster political opposition. Better for Americans to be as gullible and easily manipulated as the people who buy brain pills from right-wing podcasts, use ivermectin to treat COVID, or believe that vaccines are “weapons of mass destruction.” This purge will dramatically impair the ability to solve problems, prevent disease, design policy, inform the public, and make technological advancements. Like the catastrophic loss of knowledge in Western Europe that followed the fall of Rome, it is a self-inflicted calamity. All that matters to Trumpists is that they can reign unchallenged over the ruins.

After a decades-long campaign to beat the parasites down to Panama, they're speeding back up north.

The United States has, for 70 years, been fighting a continuous aerial war against the New World screwworm, a parasite that eats animals alive: cow, pig, deer, dog, even human. (Its scientific name, C. hominivorax, translates to “man-eater.”) Larvae of the parasitic fly chew through flesh, transforming small nicks into big, gruesome wounds. But in the 1950s, the U.S. Department of Agriculture laid the groundwork for a continent-wide assault. Workers raised screwworms in factories, blasted them with radiation until they were sterile, and dropped the sterile adult screwworms by the millions—even hundreds of millions—weekly over the U.S., then farther south in Mexico, and eventually in the rest of North America.



The sterile flies proceeded to, well, screw the continent's wild populations into oblivion, and in 2006, an invisible barrier was established at the Darién Gap, the jungle that straddles the Panama-Colombia border, to cordon the screwworm-free north off from the south. The barrier, as I observed when I reported from Panama several years ago, consisted of planes releasing millions of sterile screwworms to rain down over the Darién Gap every week. This never-ending battle kept the threat of screwworms far from America.



But in 2022, the barrier was breached. Cases in Panama—mostly in cattle—skyrocketed from dozens a year to 1,000, despite ongoing drops of sterile flies. The parasite then began moving northward, at first slowly and then rapidly by 2024, which is when I began getting alarmed emails from those following the situation in Central America. As of this month, the parasite has advanced 1,600 miles through eight countries to reach Oaxaca and Veracruz in Mexico, with 700 miles left to go until the Texas border. The U.S. subsequently suspended live-cattle imports from Mexico.



After this latest news broke, I spoke with Wayne Cockrell, a Texas rancher who fears the screwworm's return to Texas is now a matter of when, not if. The anti-screwworm program cannot produce enough sterile flies to stop the parasite's advance, much less beat it back down to Panama, Cockrell explained. He has followed the outbreak closely as the chair of the cattle-health committee for the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, even visiting the sterile-fly factory recently. “There's a sense of dread on my part now,” he told me.



At 60, he is too young to remember screwworms himself, but he's heard the horror stories. Every cut, every scratch, every navel of a newborn calf threatened to turn fatal in the pre-eradication era. If the parasite does take hold in the U.S. again, it could take decades to push screwworms back down to Panama. That is, after all, how long it took the first time. Decades of screwworm vigilance have been undone in just two years.





You only have to glance at a map to understand why the screwworm outbreak is now at an alarming inflection point.



Central America is shaped like a funnel with a long, bumpy tail that reaches its skinniest point in Panama. Back in the day, the USDA helped pay for screwworm eradication down to Panama out of not pure altruism but economic pragmatism: Establishing a 100-mile screwworm barrier there is cheaper than creating one at the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border. Even after screwworms began creeping up the tail of the funnel recently, the anti-screwworm campaign had one last good chance of stopping them at a narrow isthmus in southern Mexico—after which the funnel grows dramatically wider. It failed. The latest screwworm detections in Oaxaca and Veracruz are just beyond the isthmus.



The wider the new front of the screwworm war grows, the more sterile screwworms are needed to stop the parasite's advance. But the supply is already overstretched. The fly factory in Panama has increased production from its usual 20 million flies a week to its maximum of 100 million, which are now all being dispersed over Mexico. But planes used to drop 150 million flies a week over the isthmus in Mexico during the first eradication campaign in the 1980s. And when the front was even farther north in Mexico, a factory there churned out as many as 550 million flies weekly to cover the huge area. That factory, as well as one in Texas, has long since shut down.



The Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association is asking the USDA to build a new sterile-fly plant in the U.S., one big enough to produce the hundreds of millions that may soon be necessary. “We are working closely with Mexico to reestablish a biological barrier and prevent further geographic spread,” a USDA spokesperson wrote in response to questions about the adequacy of sterile-fly production. “If the fly spreads further geographically, we will need to reevaluate production capacity.” Several Texas lawmakers recently introduced the STOP Screwworms Act, which directs the USDA to open a new factory, but the whole process could still take years. “The facility needs to start tomorrow,” Cockrell said.



The U.S. cattle industry is unprepared for the screwworm's return, he said, rattling off more reasons: Certain drugs to treat screwworm infection are not licensed in the U.S., having been unnecessary for half a century. Ranches used to employ 50 cowboys who regularly inspected cattle, and now they might have only five. And routine industry practices such as branding and ear tagging leave the animals vulnerable to screwworm infection. To face the screwworm, the cattle industry will have to adapt quickly to a new normal. The parasite could propel beef prices, which are already sky-high due to drought, even higher.





How screwworms managed to jump the barrier in 2022 is not fully clear. But in the years immediately before, the coronavirus pandemic reportedly created supply-chain snarls at the fly factory in Panama and disrupted regular cattle inspections that might have set off the alarm bells earlier. And the border between Panama and Colombia got a lot busier; the Darién Gap, once a notoriously impenetrable jungle, became a popular route for migrants.



Still, the screwworm advanced relatively slowly through Panama and Costa Rica for the first couple of years. Then it hit Nicaragua, and over just 10 weeks in 2024, it shot from the country's northern border through Honduras and Guatemala to reach Mexico. This rapid advance was because of the illegal cattle trade, Jeremy Radachowsky, the director for Mesoamerican and the Western Caribbean at the Wildlife Conservation Society, told me. His organization has tracked the practice in Central America, where 800,000 cattle a year are raised illegally in nature reserves and then smuggled by boat and truck up to Mexico. This allowed the screwworm to spread much faster than it can fly. The line of new screwworm cases followed known smuggling routes, Radachowsky said. The constant northward movement of infected cattle could now make re-eradication more difficult. It's like trying to empty a pool when “the spigot's still open,” he said.



Decades of screwworm-free existence meant that even ranchers, whose livelihoods are directly affected, were slow to recognize the growing emergency. “We were so successful that literally people forgot,” a U.S. official in Central America familiar with the situation (speaking anonymously due to the delicate politics involved) told me. Inspections, timely reports of infection, and restrictions on cattle movement are important pieces of eradication, in addition to the release of sterile flies.



Over the years, scientists have also proposed more advanced ways of controlling the screwworm through genetics, though none is yet ready for prime time. The USDA supported research by Max Scott, an entomologist at North Carolina State University, to create a male-only strain that could reduce the number of flies needed for dispersal, but funding ended last summer. He has also proposed using gene drives, a still-controversial technique that could rapidly “drive” genetic material that makes females sterile into the wild population. The USDA wasn't interested, he told me. (A spokesperson says the USDA “continues to research and investigate new tools,” including genetically engineered male-only screwworms.) But he did strike up a collaboration several years ago with scientists in Uruguay studying a gene drive for sterile screwworms.



Uruguay is interested because it never got to benefit from screwworm eradication; the country is located about halfway down South America, deep in screwworm territory. A retired USDA scientist, Steven Skoda, told me that he and his colleagues used to dream of “a world totally free of screwworm.” But eradication never reached South America, and now even the barrier protecting North America is no longer intact. The campaign to push screwworms from the south of Mexico—roughly where the parasite is right now—to the southern edge of Panama took 21 years. The way things are going, Cockrell said, some of his longtime colleagues in Panama might not see screwworms eradicated again in their country in their lifetime.

In an effort to attract more right-leaning faculty, some elite universities are borrowing tactics long used to promote racial diversity.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

No one would be surprised to learn that an elite university has a plan to counteract the structural barriers to the advancement of a minority group. Johns Hopkins University's latest diversity initiative, however, has managed to put a new spin on a familiar concept: The minority group in question is conservative professors.

Between 30 and 40 percent of Americans identify as conservative, but conservatives make up only one of every 10 professors in academia, and even fewer in the humanities and most social-science departments. (At least they did in 2014, when the most recent comprehensive study was done. The number today is probably even lower.) Of the money donated by Yale faculty to political candidates in 2023, for example, 98 percent went to Democrats.

Some university leaders worry that this degree of ideological homogeneity is harmful both academically (students and faculty would benefit from being exposed to a wider range of ideas) and in terms of higher education's long-term prospects (being hated by half the country is not sustainable). Accordingly, Johns Hopkins recently unveiled a partnership with the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a center-right think tank, designed to inject some ideological diversity into the university. Steven Teles, a political scientist who wrote a widely discussed article last year for The Chronicle of Higher Education titled “Why Are There So Few Conservative Professors?,” is one of the faculty members involved with the partnership. The institutions will collaborate on a number of efforts to integrate conservative and heterodox thinkers.

Johns Hopkins is part of a growing trend. Several elite red-state public universities have recently established academic centers designed to attract conservative scholars. And institutions that haven't sought out conservative faculty may soon find new reasons to do so. The Trump administration has demanded that Harvard hire additional conservative professors or risk losing even more of its federal funding. (Even as it made that demand, it insisted that Harvard adopt “merit-based admissions policies and cease all preferences based on race, color, national origin, or proxies thereof.”) In response, Harvard's president said that the university is expanding programs to increase intellectual diversity on campus. The era of DEI for conservatives has begun.

Academia has leaned left for as long as anyone can remember. But for most of the 20th century, conservative faculty were a robust presence throughout the humanities and social sciences. (In 1969, for example, even as anti-war protests raged across campuses, a quarter of the professoriate identified as at least “moderately” conservative.) But their ranks have thinned since the 1990s. At the same time, moderate and independent professors have been replaced by people who explicitly identify as liberal or progressive.

A traditional free-market conservative might interpret these statistics as evidence that right-wing thinkers simply haven't achieved at a high-enough level to become professors. But some reformers have embraced a more left-wing theory for conservatives' anemic representation in academia. “The current injustice is a consequence of previous injustice,” Teles told me. (Teles identifies not as a conservative but as an “abundance liberal.”) “You don't deal with structural injustice purely through anti-discrimination,” he added. In other words, action of a more affirmative variety is needed.

Rose Horowitch: The race-blind college-admissions era is off to a weird start

Opinions differ on the precise extent to which conservatives are being excluded from academia versus self-selecting into nonacademic careers. But they clearly face barriers that liberal and leftist scholars don't. Professors decide who joins their ranks and what research gets published in flagship journals. And several studies show that academics are willing to discriminate against applicants with different political views. One 2021 survey found that more than 40 percent of American (and Canadian) academics said they would not hire a Donald Trump supporter. Then there's the fact that entire disciplines have publicly committed themselves to progressive values. “It is a standard of responsible professional conduct for anthropologists to continue their research, scholarship, and practice in service of dismantling institutions of colonization and helping to redress histories of oppression and exploitation,” the American Anthropological Association declared in 2020.

“Professors will tell you straight up that people who hold the wrong views don't belong in universities,” Musa al-Gharbi, a sociology professor at Stony Brook University who studies progressive social-justice discourse, told me. “That's the difference between viewpoint discrimination and other forms of discrimination.”

One result is that universities tasked with teaching students about the world they live in employ hardly anyone who represents views that much of the population holds. Ideological homogeneity affects which fields people study (military and religious history have gone out of vogue) and what views students are willing to express in class. (A recent survey found that only one-third of Harvard seniors—and only 17 percent of conservatives—felt comfortable sharing their opinions on controversial topics.) Liberal professors of course still teach Edmund Burke and Milton Friedman, Ron Daniels, the president of Johns Hopkins, told me. But, he said, learning from faculty who are immersed in the conservative intellectual tradition is a different academic experience.

Conservative underrepresentation has also hurt higher education's standing with the country at large. Polls show that Americans, particularly on the right, are losing trust in universities. A Gallup survey taken last year, for example, found that Republican confidence in higher education had dropped from 56 to 20 percent over the course of a decade. Respondents attributed this in part to perceived liberal bias in the academy.

Daniels recognized these issues in a 2021 book, What Universities Owe Democracy. In it, he argues that campuses need a “purposeful pluralism” to train students to engage across differences. Jenna Silber Storey, a senior fellow at AEI and a former professor of politics and international relations at Furman University—where she estimates that “maybe 4 or 5 percent” of the faculty was conservative—read the book, and the two began discussing how to improve diversity of thought on campuses.

Hiring a conservative professor isn't as straightforward as it sounds. At this point, few qualified conservatives are in the applicant pool in the humanities and social sciences, Teles told me. This has led some higher-education leaders to borrow tactics that were long used to redress the country's history of racial and ethnic discrimination.

Legislatures in red and purple states across the country have shoveled money into universities to establish schools of civic thought, which are marketed as the conservative answer to academia's leftward drift and the rise of identity-oriented disciplines. The effort started at Arizona State University, which established its School of Civic and Economic Thought and Leadership in 2017. The University of Texas at Austin, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville have all done the same. Now the movement is spreading to elite private universities. Yale announced at a recent conference co-hosted by Hopkins and AEI that it will open its own center for civic thought.

The conservative politicians and right-wing donors behind these centers advertise them as a way to fight back against the excesses of the left. But Storey told me that they are not generally ideological; the goal is to teach students to debate across differences. Supporters see them as a safe space for conservative scholars who feel ostracized by the broader academy. There, they can hopefully generate work that earns recognition from researchers in the mainstream, just as disciplines such as gender studies and African American studies gained legitimacy over time, Teles told me.

Johns Hopkins has similarly repurposed techniques that are more commonly practiced by DEI offices. (Before she left her teaching job, Storey chaired her department's DEI program.) The university first made funding available to hire a cadre of conservative and heterodox thinkers within the faculty of arts and sciences. So-called cluster hiring has been a popular way to create a support network for faculty of color who might otherwise feel isolated. Teles, in partnership with Storey at AEI, is also developing a mentorship program for conservative graduate students. The idea is to intervene earlier in the academic pipeline to keep right-leaning thinkers on the path to a professorship. Additionally, a fellowship program will send Hopkins professors to do stints at AEI, and vice versa. The university is trying to normalize conservative perspectives on campus and in the university's research and public-facing statements, Daniels told me. He hopes that the effort will serve as a model for like-minded leaders.

Sian Leah Beilock: Saving the idea of the university

If the right has discovered the language of systemic discrimination, some on the left have begun speaking in terms of identity-blind meritocracy. Juliana Paré-Blagoev, an education professor at Hopkins and the outgoing president of the university's chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), told me that she's in favor of affirmative action—just not for conservatives, because they haven't suffered documented discrimination. “It doesn't mean that everybody in that center isn't a good scholar or that they can't be competent and strong contributors, but if you look at the actuality of it, their CVs tend to be thinner than others,” Paré-Blagoev said. She is open to the possibility that conservatives are underrepresented because they don't feel welcome, but she doesn't think universities should make systemic changes to accommodate them. “I don't think that an individual's discomfort is a five-alarm fire,” she said.

François Furstenberg, a history professor at Johns Hopkins and the secretary for the university's AAUP chapter, told me that Republicans have unfairly smeared affirmative action as a way to hire people “based on their race and not on their qualifications.” Now they're the ones who want to hire professors based on their politics, not their fitness for the role. (Teles told me that he and Storey are focused on broadening the applicant pool for academic roles, rather than just giving people an advantage because of their political leanings.)

As with so many topics, the Trump factor has complicated the question of ideological diversity. On the one hand, the White House's crusade against elite higher education has raised the pressure to recruit conservatives. The administration made the connection explicit in its shakedown of Harvard. After announcing that it would review $9 billion in federal grants and contracts, it issued a list of far-reaching demands that the university would have to meet in order to keep the funding. These included auditing faculty opinions and ensuring that every department and field is viewpoint-diverse. Harvard rejected the administration's demands, but President Alan Garber has nevertheless acknowledged that ideological homogeneity is a problem on campus.

On the other hand, the viciousness and obvious bad faith of Trump's attacks have made it more difficult for universities to pursue even changes they think will benefit their institutions, lest they appear to be capitulating to the president. “The fact that those extreme demands—for example, for government control over the curriculum—have come bundled with the notion that universities ought to be more politically diverse has tied those two things together in a way that has made political diversity much less palatable even than it was before,” Neil Gross, a sociology professor at Colby College and the author of the 2014 study on viewpoint diversity, told me.

Teles told me that the conservatives collaborating with Hopkins are intent on working within universities to reform them, not from outside to destroy them. “These are not the same people who are wrecking the financial basis of our university,” he said.

Daniels, the Hopkins president, told me that the hypocrisy of the messenger shouldn't obscure kernels of truth in the message. As universities have debated how to respond to the Trump administration's attacks, they've overlooked the fact that some of the critique is fair. “Defending the university,” he said, “actually requires that we demonstrate to America our capacity for self-criticism and self-repair.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The new political divide splitting young Americans in half.

by  Christian Paz

We can confidently say that Gen Z got a lot more Republican over the last couple of years, thanks to a swarm of new, first-time young voters — specifically men of all races.

Pre-election polling captured this phenomenon, voter registration trends tracked it, and post-election exit polls suggest ballots reflected it. Add to this a recent report from the Democratic firm Catalist, which has produced some of the most definitive analyses of the 2024 election, and you start to get a pretty solid sense that young voters have shifted hard toward the Republican Party.

Still, that might elide some nuance within Gen Z.

The data we have from the last election suggests, broadly, at least two types of young voters: “Old Gen Z” — more Democratic, more progressive — and “Young Gen Z” — more Trump-curious and more skeptical of the status quo.

That internal split, roughly between those aged 18 to 24 in the latter camp and 25 to 29 in the former, hasn't dissipated post-election; it is still showing up in polling and surveys. No cohort is monolithic, but a combination of factors — the pandemic, the rise of smartphones and newer social media, inflation, Trump — seems to be driving a wedge within Gen Z.

The upshot is that there appear to be two Gen Zs. And that divide within the generation certainly complicates the long-held belief that younger voters are generally more progressive than older ones — and that Democrats thus have a natural edge with younger generations.

About a year ago, the Harvard Youth Poll, a public opinion project from that university's Institute of Politics that has been recording young voters' sentiments for more than a decade, tracked a major difference in the way voters under the age of 30 were feeling about Joe Biden and Donald Trump. 

While Biden held a lead of 14 percentage points among adults aged 25 to 29, his lead among 18- to 24-year-olds was 10 points smaller. Support for Trump was higher among the younger part of this cohort by 5 percentage points in the March 2024 poll.

That dynamic remained true even after the Democrats switched to Kamala Harris as their standard-bearer. In the same poll conducted in September, the younger half of Gen Z voters continued to lag in its Democratic support compared to the older half.

Now, more than four months into the Trump presidency, this dynamic — of Young Gen Z being more friendly to Republicans than Old Gen Z — continues to show up in the latest Harvard IOP poll. 

For example, the March 2025 survey found that Young Gen Z holds more favorable views of Republicans in Congress than Old Gen Z; while the older cohort disapproves of the GOP by a 35-point margin, the margin for the younger cohort is 28 points. Similarly, the older cohort disapproves of Trump's job performance more sharply than the younger cohort — a 7-point gap on the margins.

The same survey found Trump's favorability is 5 points better with Young Gen Z than with Old Gen Z. And while both groups tend to be unaffiliated with either party, a slightly larger share of Young Gen Z, 26 percent to 23 percent for Old Gen Z, identifies with the GOP.

Older Gen Z hasn't seen any slippage in its wariness of Republicans. Across all three of those Harvard polls, the share who identify with the Republican Party has remained essentially unchanged. The only major difference in the spring poll is a significant shift away from Democrats toward the “independent” label. Old Gen Z's views of Republicans in Congress have gotten more positive — 63 percent of them disapprove this spring, compared to 76 percent of them last year. That said, these older Gen Z voters' views of Trump have only dropped since the fall.

Harvard's poll isn't the only one picking up this split in preferences. Yale University's youth poll from April has tracked similar divisions in political identification and preferences, while other non-political polling from the Pew Research Center has tracked internal differences within Gen Z as well.

In terms of ideology, the polling is noisier, but shows signs of a split as well. 

Harvard's pre-election polls did track higher “conservative” identification rates among under-25s than over-25s. Across all three 2024 and 2025 Harvard polls, conservative identification is essentially unchanged across both groups. Regardless of how each subgroup self-identifies, however, other polling suggests that the youngest Zoomers may still hold more conservative views than the oldest Zoomers.

According to the spring Yale Youth Poll, younger Gen Z men and women tend to have more Republican-coded opinions than their older Gen Z peers on a range of policy issues. They tend to view Trump more favorably, side with the Republican position on some policies, like immigration, trans women in college sports, and Ukraine, by higher margins, and are more likely to consider casting a vote for a generic Republican candidate than older Gen Z. 

Younger Gen Z is also the segment of Americans where religiosity seems to be holding steady, if not outright increasing. As I've reported before, young Gen Z men are holding on or returning to organized religion in rates high enough to slow down a decades-long trend toward religious dissociation in America. 

They are outpacing older Gen Z and younger millennial men in identifying with a religion, per the Pew Research Center's latest Religious Landscape Study. And in particular, among all Gen Z born between 2000 and 2006, a higher share, 51 percent, identify as Christian than they did in 2023, when 45 percent said so.

Increased religiosity isn't necessarily direct evidence of more conservative thought or Republican affiliation, but there is a correlation between Republican partisan identification and respondents saying that the role of religion is important to them or that they identify with a religion at all. In other words, more religious Americans tend to be more Republican, or more conservative.

Should these trends hold, they will pose a challenge for both major political parties. 

The idea of a rising Democratic electorate — that younger, diverse, and more progressive generations of voters becoming eligible to vote could deliver consistent victories for Democratic and liberal candidates — looks increasingly tenuous, not least after the 2024 elections. The polling since suggests the pro-GOP shift among younger Gen Z-ers may not be a blip. 

But Republicans will have work to do to sustain these gains and to have them work in their party's favor during election season. That Young Gen Z showed up for the GOP in 2024 doesn't guarantee that they will do so again in next year's midterms, or the next presidential election.

And a lot is at stake. Gen Z will become the largest part of the electorate in 2030, and will have the power to sway elections, if Democrats and Republicans can keep them engaged. 

For now, the data show there may be something durable in the split that 2024 polling captured: The newest cohort of young voters, who couldn't vote in previous elections, was significantly more Republican than the oldest young voters. In 2020, Trump got about 31 percent of their vote. In 2024, he got 43 percent of their support.

And the 2024 Catalist report suggests that the shift was driven by the emergence of a previously disengaged, male, and racially diverse youth electorate, made up predominantly of newly eligible Young Gen Z voters. Young Black and Latino men in this cohort shifted their votes to Trump, and were a significant chunk of new voters. Was this shift unique to Trump and his campaign? Perhaps. But what data we do have suggests there is an underlying curiosity or openness toward Republicans among the youngest cohort of Gen Z — one strong enough to cleave this generation in two.

China may have met an important climate goal — ahead of schedule.

by  Umair Irfan

China is the world's largest single greenhouse gas emitter, spewing more than double the amount of heat-trapping chemicals as the next biggest climate polluter, the United States.

For decades, China's emissions soared ever higher as its economy grew, burning extraordinary volumes of coal, oil, and natural gas to light up cities, power factories, and fuel cars. The trend seemed unstoppable: At one point, China was approving two new coal power plants per week.

It was an alarming prospect for the whole world. “Eighty-five percent of emissions for the remainder of the century are projected to occur outside the EU and the US,” said Michael Greenstone, an economist at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. “If we're going to make real progress on climate change, that will require reductions from that 85 percent.” And since China is the single-largest emitter, there's no feasible way to meet international climate change targets without them on board. 

But now, for the first time, there's been a shift: China's greenhouse gas emissions have actually fallen even as energy demand went up. 

According to a new report at Carbon Brief by Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air, China's overall greenhouse gas emissions have dropped for the first time, thanks largely to the country's aggressive build-out of clean energy. Looking at official statistics and commercial data, the analysis shows greenhouse gas output fell 1 percent over the past year, even as China's overall energy use and economic activity increased. 

It's not a massive shift, but the fact that the curve has bent at all is a major development for the global effort against climate change. 

The growth rate of humanity's greenhouse gas emissions has begun to level off, but it has yet to decline. In order to eventually halt human-caused warming, that rate has to effectively reach zero, and in order to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement, that has to happen roughly within the next three decades. 

The decline of emissions in China is a big step toward this international goal, and the timing puts it on course for its own climate targets, too. China had previously committed to peaking its greenhouse gas emissions before 2030. 

“This is a little ahead of schedule,” Greenstone said. “The planet is happy about that.”

In large part, the decline in emissions came from clean electricity production. China deployed vastly more wind, solar, and nuclear power — sources that don't emit carbon dioxide — at a pace faster than its electricity demand growth. Meanwhile, its coal and gas electricity production dropped. China's emissions have dipped before due to economic slowdowns, so the fact that its economy grew while emissions declined is a significant turning point, putting China in a league with more than 30 countries, including the US, that have already done the same. 

China has established itself as the world's largest producer of solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and batteries, driving down prices for the global market. It's deploying these technologies within its own borders, as well as exporting them en masse, and some of its biggest customers are developing countries. That means China's investments in clean energy redound to the rest of the world. Renewables accounted for 90 percent of new power capacity installed worldwide last year. 

Later this year, countries will gather in Brazil for the COP30 climate conference, where world leaders will hash out how to bring new, stronger commitments to cut their contributions to climate change by 2035. China's President Xi Jinping pledged that his country will come to the table with a comprehensive plan to further reduce its emissions across its economy, while the US may not show up at all. One his first day of his second term, President Donald Trump began the process of pulling the country out of the Paris climate agreement altogether. Again. 

However, in the Carbon Brief report, Myllyvirta noted that China's small drop in emissions could easily go back up. If its economy grows even faster, demand for fossil fuels could rise again. Whether that happens depends, in part, on how the dust settles on the tariff fight between the US and China. High trade barriers would slow China's economy. Losing the US as a customer could push China to try to compensate by installing more clean energy domestically. 

China also emits greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide. In particular, China is releasing high levels of HFC-23, a byproduct of making nonstick coatings and a pollutant that is thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide when it comes to trapping heat in the atmosphere. China committed to halting HFC-23 pollution entirely when it signed the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol in 2021. 

To make China's emissions reductions durable, there needs to be more stringent policies and enforcement to curb climate pollution within the country. Otherwise, current clean energy technologies would need to get cheaper, and new ones would have to be invented. “Given the tepid appetite for aggressive carbon policy around the world, I think the most important thing the world could do is invest in early stage R&D on new energy technologies,” Greenstone said. 

Meanwhile, US emissions are also seeing a slight downward trend. But the Trump administration's push to extract more fossil fuels, cut incentives for clean energy, and roll back efforts to curb greenhouse gases mean that the US could become a larger climate polluter. That could offset some of the progress in China and slow the overall global endeavor to limit climate change.

India-Pakistan's almost-war revealed something alarming about our political moment.

by  Joshua Keating

Humanity has lived with nuclear weapons for so long — 80 years, this year — without destroying itself, that we sometimes take them for granted. But there's no guarantee that our run of luck will continue. In fact, the risks are growing and transforming.

 The recent round of fighting between India and Pakistan, the most serious violence between the two nuclear rivals in decades, is a reminder that the risks of nuclear escalation have not disappeared. But that doesn't mean the risks are exactly the same as they used to be. 

The “nuclear age,” can be divided into three parts: The first, from the bombing of Hiroshima in 1945 until the end of the Cold War, was characterized by arms buildups and the ever-present threat of nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union. The second, a roughly 30-year period after the end of the Cold War, was marked by arms control agreements, a reduction in the threat of nuclear war, and new concerns like nuclear terrorism and proliferation to rogue regimes like North Korea. 

The third age is just beginning. In his new book, The New Nuclear Age: At the Precipice of Armageddon, leading nuclear security analyst Ankit Panda introduces readers to a new era that began in roughly the mid-2020s. This new era is characterized by renewed tensions between the world's superpowers, the emergence of China as a third major nuclear power, the collapse of Cold War-era arms control treaties, and new and potentially destabilizing technological developments like cyberwar and artificial intelligence. The war in Ukraine, the largest conventional war in decades and one that nuclear threats have loomed over from the start, was the most vivid illustration yet of the dynamics of this new era. 

In an interview with Vox, Panda, the Stanton senior fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a widely cited authority on all things nuclear, discussed the dynamics of our new nuclear world and how President Donald Trump's return to the White House could raise nuclear risks. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. 

When nuclear weapons first appeared, leaders and experts expected that their use would just become routine. They'd be just another tool in the arsenal. That, thankfully, hasn't happened. 

So is there a case to be made that deterrence, the idea that countries will avoid using weapons because of the risks of retaliation, just works? Are leaders too afraid of the dangers of these weapons to actually use them, and maybe the risks of nuclear war aren't as high as we might think?

I wouldn't go that far. The presence of nuclear weapons does induce a degree of caution in national leaders, militaries, and policymakers in general. But I consider myself something of a deterrence pessimist in that I believe deterrence is real, that it has the effects that its practitioners seek, but I'm not assured that deterrence itself can be rendered perfectly safe because rendering deterrence perfectly safe is something of an oxymoron. 

Deterrence is about the manipulation of useful risk. We endlessly debate what level of risk we should be willing to tolerate when it comes to the practice of nuclear deterrence, but we know from the Cold War that there have been instances of organizational failure and human miscalculation that easily could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. 

Ultimately, nuclear weapons are a human invention. Nuclear deterrence is an enterprise that requires the involvement of fallible, human organizations. 

Longer term, making sure that we keep nuclear weapons unused is going to require a lot more active tending of this incredibly complex enterprise that's growing a lot more complicated by the day. 

This past month, we saw a real-world demonstration of some of the dynamics you write about in the book, in the brief but very intense conflict between India and Pakistan, two nuclear rivals. What do you think that incident tells us about how crises like this are likely to play out in this new nuclear age? 

I think we can describe what we saw last week between India and Pakistan as the first South Asian nuclear crisis of this third nuclear range. Both countries have tried to rewrite the rules of their mutual coexistence under the nuclear shadow. [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi's government has for years been interested in calling Pakistan's “nuclear bluff.” It wanted to find ways to inflict punishment on the Pakistanis with military force for what India perceives as state-backed terror, and it did exactly that. 

I think it's fair to say that what we saw was the most intense multidomain, air-to-air and air-to-ground engagement between two nuclear-armed countries ever. We've never seen anything like this in the nuclear age. 

Does that imply that India is simply no longer afraid of Pakistan's nuclear deterrent or no longer takes it seriously? India has taken steps to avoid escalation with Pakistan in the past, in part because of nuclear fears, but Modi said in his speech following the end of this most recent conflict that India would no longer give in to what he called “nuclear blackmail.”

 I argue in my book that what we call nuclear blackmail is actually just nuclear deterrence. We're simply applying a value judgment to the deterrer: In this case Pakistan, but it's also how Vladimir Putin's nuclear signaling is described in European and American commentary about the war in Ukraine. 

When it comes to Pakistan's nuclear signaling, it had several audiences. One was, of course, the Indians, and I think this crisis perhaps told the Pakistanis that some of the older assumptions they might have retained about the ways in which India would be deterred are no longer sufficient.

The second is the United States. This is what really gave me concern in the early days of the crisis. Traditionally, we in the United States have seen a pressing national interest in preventing India and Pakistan from getting into direct clashes, but this is a very different Washington, and based on the statements from the administration, it wasn't clear that the US saw it as in its interest to get involved. But then whatever the US saw in its intelligence reports changed that pretty quickly. 

So initially, you saw JD Vance coming out and saying this is none of our business, then very soon after was working the phones with the Indian prime minister. I suspect what we saw was the Pakistanis beginning to either talk about moving their nuclear weapons around or actually moving nuclear weapons around in a way that convinced the United States that, if the escalation continued, we could end up in a place where things could get really ugly.

I think we saw that we still have an interest in not seeing the nuclear taboo broken anywhere in the world. And I think even if your worldview is that we should be placing America first, that interest doesn't fundamentally change.

Over the past few weeks, we've seen more non-nuclear countries talk about whether they should get their own weapons. Several countries in Europe are talking about it. There's a very active debate in South Korea. Do you think we could see more countries going nuclear in a world where US security guarantees seem a little less ironclad than they used to?

The United States has played a vital, I would argue, load-bearing function in global non-proliferation, by virtue of extending its own nuclear defense to a long list of countries around the world. There's more than 50 countries to which the United States extends assurances that it will use all of its military capabilities, including nuclear weapons if necessary, to defend these allies.

I should emphasize that these allies, at no moment, really have been perfectly assured. This is fundamentally a promise that the United States makes that's very difficult to render fully credible. We're essentially telling non-nuclear countries, including some that share borders with countries like China — like North Korea, like Russia — that we would be willing to run the risk of nuclear war on their behalf. And that sounds a little crazy, and from the perspective of our allies, that's part of the reason why they've been very skittish, historically, about the statements our national leaders make. 

So, as we sort of live through the first few months of the second Trump administration, for the first time since the end of the Cold War, the level of interest among many allies of the United States in acquiring nuclear weapons is higher than it has been in decades. Again, not everything about this new nuclear age is new. During the Cold War, we did have prominent concerns from allies about these very same issues. The West Germans wanted nuclear weapons. The South Koreans had a covert nuclear program that the United States put in the box in the late 1970s. So we've been here before.

But, of course, today, the kinds of dynamics we're seeing now are fundamentally a lot more serious. Because I would argue that the United States is currently in the process of relitigating its entire grand strategy. It is rethinking the role that it sees for itself in the international system and its relationship to long-standing alliances. So this increases the pull of nuclear weapons [for some countries]. 

Now, does this mean that nuclear proliferation is preordained in the 21st century and the third nuclear age? I don't think so. I think for a variety of very good reasons, allies will be very careful about how they choose to proceed, even if they have a national conversation about whether nuclear weapons potentially answer some of the sources of insecurity they currently perceive. Even if they answer that question in the affirmative, there's a second question that they then have to ask, which is, well, how do we get them, and what would the costs be? That is where things start to get a lot more complicated. 

What do you think is going to be the lasting legacy of the war in Ukraine on the nuclear weapons front? On the one hand, we've seen the threat of nuclear weapons brandished by Vladimir Putin in a really alarming way. On the other hand, the fact that nuclear weapons haven't been used, shows that deterrence and the taboos against their use are still at least partly in effect, right? 

I mean, my book exists because of the Ukraine war. I think the Ukraine war has been the biggest wake-up call, [showing] that we have arrived in this new nuclear era where we, once again, need to think about the possibility of global nuclear conflict.

It's not that we live in the world of the Cold War, where we are worried about massive nuclear exchanges or first-strike scenarios. I think the most likely scenario leading to nuclear use today would be a conventional war or a crisis that either directly implicates the nuclear-armed states or implicates their national interests in a way that's likely to draw them into a conflict. 

I think Ukraine is the first conflict, in many ways, of this new nuclear age, in that it has definitely tested many of our beliefs about nuclear deterrence and has really revealed the opportunities and limitations with deterrence. Deterrence has been beneficial for both NATO and Russia in seeking their political ends: Russia to carry out its conventional war, NATO to support Ukraine militarily. 

Both Russia and NATO have respected fundamental red lines as they perceive them on the other side, but at the same time, each party has been frustrated with its ability to fully implement its plans. If Russia were more successful with its nuclear threats, NATO wouldn't be in the position where it ended up supplying Ukraine and ensuring that Ukraine could put up an effective conventional military resistance. Similarly, NATO hasn't been able to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine or put its own boots on the ground. So deterrence doesn't solve all your problems, but it certainly is an important factor in shaping the modern battlefield between nuclear-armed countries and their patrons.

When it comes to the current administration, Donald Trump has made several comments about how seriously he takes the threat of nuclear war, and he's even proposed “denuclearization” talks with China and Russia. But do you see any signs that this kind of talk is actually being turned into policy? 

I don't see a big policy push on arms control or even nuclear policy matters. The Trump administration, for the moment, doesn't appear to be deeply interested in questions of nuclear policy, and so things are really just on autopilot from where the Biden administration left off.

That said, Donald Trump certainly has spoken about nuclear weapons quite a bit. He's cited them as an existential threat to humanity. He's pointed out on multiple occasions that he sees nuclear war as a greater threat to mankind than climate change. And he has said for decades that he does have an interest in something resembling arms control. In the 1980s, he even said that one of his greatest dreams of life was to negotiate an arms control agreement. 

So I do think as a second-term president, he does appear to be more concerned with matters pertaining to his personal legacy. I think that explains some of what we've seen with regard to talk of, for instance, territorial conquest of Canada, Greenland, and Panama, and so we might see a similar impulse as he tries to renormalize relations with Russia, to broach the topic of arms control. 

Now the risk here is, of course, that the Russians will be a lot better prepared. I think the Russians have a policy process at the moment that will lead to them having a much clearer sense of what they would want to ask of the United States in that arms control negotiation. Arms control has always been a means to advance national security. It hasn't been an end in itself. 

During the first Trump administration, Trump did authorize his envoys to try to seek arms control breakthroughs with both Russia and China. It just so happened that at the time, neither country really saw a national interest-based case for engaging with the United States in good faith on arms control. 

So it's possible that we get arms control. It just might not be the kind of arms control agreement that would advance US or allied national interests.

Next year, we're going to see the expiration of New START, the last significant treaty putting limits on the size of the US and Russian nuclear arsenal. What happens after that? Could we see the kind of arms buildups we saw during the Cold War again? 

The idea that we're going back to a world of tens of thousands of nuclear weapons is just not consistent with the current state of the nuclear enterprise. It would just be incredibly costly. But what I think the end of New START will mark is the formal arrival of a more dangerous, multipolar nuclear era to which the United States will look to respond, and there's a really active debate about how it will respond. 

One of the fundamental changes for the United States, in particular, but also for American allies and even non-ally countries like India, is the remarkable shift that we've seen in China's approach. We don't understand exactly why that change has happened, but the change is that China has moved from a nuclear force that for decades remained fairly low in terms of numbers to a nuclear force that the US intelligence community now estimates will potentially reach 1,500 warheads by the mid 2030s.

That's still less than the current deployed nuclear force that the United States and Russia maintain under new START. But the question for the United States if you're looking at Russia as well as China, as well as a North Korea that probably is soon going to have as many warheads as China did at the start of the start of the 2020s, is whether the US might need more tools in its nuclear toolkit. This, I think, is going to be the fundamental question for the Trump administration.

There are realistic things the US could do, like it could put additional nuclear warheads on intercontinental missiles and submarine-launched missiles that, for arms control reasons, largely have deployed for a number of years with less than the total number of warheads they can accommodate. 

But if Russia and China determined that the US response to this new environment will require them to also make adjustments to their own nuclear postures, we end up in an arms race, and we end up in a world where we face greater nuclear dangers because all three of the major nuclear powers will see incentives to posture their nuclear and conventional forces in more dangerous ways.

It certainly seems, as you note in the book, that despite the growing dangers, nuclear weapons are still not as prominent in our political debates or the culture (Oppenheimer notwithstanding) as they were in the Cold War. Certainly, younger generations don't have the same visceral experience with this as those who lived through the Cuban Missile Crisis or the 1980s arms buildups did. Do we, as Americans, particularly younger Americans, need to be more worried about nukes? 

For me, I lived in India in 1998, the year India tested a nuclear weapon. The next year, in 1999, India and Pakistan fought a war in the nuclear shadow. And so, I'm a millennial, but that gives me a perspective that's not too common in the United States or in the West. I think millennials and Gen Z, these generations that have come of age in largely peaceful and prosperous Western countries in the aftermath of the Cold War, will need to wrap their heads around this really important source of catastrophic risk for humanity. 

There's a fine line between being alarmist and trying to inform the public, and I hope my book walks that tightrope appropriately. It's not that, you know, I think we all need to run around with our hair on fire about global thermonuclear war breaking out at any moment, but the message for future generations is that nuclear weapons very much deserve our attention, especially in democracies where citizens vote for their lawmakers and for their national leaders. 

In the United States, when it comes to matters of nuclear war, the president has absolute authority. There's not a second center of decision-making. The greatest way we could actually mitigate some of these risks is to have more conscientious national leaders.

In his latest move, Trump is attacking the people who have helped bail out American higher education.

by  Kevin Carey

The Trump administration's recent decision to bar international students from attending Harvard University was less a policy decision than an act of war. The White House had hoped its opening salvo against the nation's oldest university would yield the kind of immediate capitulation offered by Columbia University. When Harvard chose to fight back instead, Trump decided to hit the university where it hurts most. 

The administration's actions are illegal and were immediately stayed by a federal judge. But that won't prevent real harm to students and higher learning. 

While Harvard has a famously selective undergraduate college, most of the university's students are in graduate or professional school, and more than a third of those older students arrive from other countries. Overall, more than a quarter of Harvard's 25,000 students come from outside the United States, a percentage that has steadily grown over time. The proportion of Harvard's international students has increased 38 percent since 2006. 

Even if the courts continue to block this move, it will be difficult for anyone to study there knowing they might be deported or imprisoned by a hostile regime — even if they're the future queen of Belgium. And an exodus of international students will end up harming universities far beyond Harvard, as well as American research and innovation itself. 

The question looming over higher education is whether the international student ban is merely the next escalation of the Trump administration's apocalyptic campaign against a handful of elite institutions (as seen by the administration's announcement Tuesday that it would cancel its remaining federal contracts with Harvard) — or the beginning of a broader attempt to apply “America First” protectionist principles to one the nation's most valuable and successful export goods: higher learning. The rapid growth of international college students in the 21st century represents exactly the kind of global cooperation the isolationists in the White House would love to destroy. 

In recent decades, international enrollment has shaped, and in some places transformed, higher learning across the country. According to the State Department, the number of annual F-1 student visas issued to international students nearly tripled from 216,000 in 2003 to 644,000 in 2015. And while many nations sent more students to America during that time, the story of international college enrollment over the last two decades has been dominated by a single country: the People's Republic of China. 

In 1997, roughly 12,000 F-1 visas were issued to Chinese students; this was only a third of the number issued to the two biggest student senders that year, South Korea and Japan. Chinese enrollment started to accelerate in the early aughts and then exploded: 114,000 by 2010; 190,000 in 2012; and a peak of 274,000 in 2015. 

The change was driven by profound social and economic shifts within China. Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution essentially shut down university enrollment for a decade. When it ended in 1976, there was a huge backlog of college students who graduated in the 1980s into the economic liberalization of Deng Xiaoping. Many of them prospered and had children — often only one — who came of age in the early 2000s. Attending an American university was a status marker and an opportunity to become a global citizen. 

At the same time, many colleges were newly hungry for international enrollment. The Great Recession savaged college finances. State governments slashed funding for public universities while families had less money to pay tuition at private colleges. 

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

Public universities offer lower prices to state residents and private schools typically discount their sticker-price tuition by more than 50 percent through grants and scholarships. But those rules only apply to Americans. Recruiting so-called full-pay international students became a key strategy for shoring up the bottom line. 

Colleges weren't always judicious in managing the influx of students from overseas. Purdue University enrolled so many Chinese students so quickly that in 2013 one of them noted that a main benefit of traveling 7,000 miles to West Lafayette, Indiana, was improving his language skills — by talking to students from other regions of China. That same year, an administrator at a second-tier private college in Philadelphia told me that the college tried to keep enrollment from any one country below a certain threshold “or else we'd have to build them a student center or something.” 

While federal law prohibits colleges from paying recruiters based on the number of students they sign up, this, too, only applies within American borders. International students sometimes pay middlemen large sums to help them navigate the huge and varied global college landscape. While many are legitimate, some are prone to falsehoods and fraud. 

At the same time, colleges also used the new influx of students to expand course offerings, build strong connections overseas, and diversify their academic communities. One of the great educational benefits of going to college is learning among people from different experiences and backgrounds. There has likely never been a better place to do that than an American college campus in the 21st century. The most talented international students helped drive American economic productivity and research supremacy to new heights. 

F-1 visas declined sharply in 2016, in part because of an administrative change that allowed Chinese students to receive five-year visas instead of reapplying every year. But the market itself was also shifting. The Chinese government invested enormous sums to build the capacity of its own national research universities, giving students better options to stay home. Geopolitical tensions were growing, and American voters chose to elect a rabidly xenophobic president in Donald Trump. Covid radically depressed international enrollment in 2020, but even after the recovery, Chinese F-1 visas in 2023 were only a third of the 2015 peak. 

Colleges managed by recruiting students from other countries to take their place. India crossed 100,000 student visa for the first time in 2022. At the turn of the century, fewer than 1,000 Vietnamese students studied in America. Today, Vietnam is our fourth-largest source of international students, more than Japan, Mexico, Germany, or Brazil. Enrollment from Ghana has quintupled in the last 10 years.

If the Trump administration expands its scorched-earth student visa strategy beyond Harvard, it won't just be the liberal enclaves and snooty college towns that suffer. Communities across the country will feel the hurt, urban and rural, in red states and blue. 

Some colleges might tip into bankruptcy. Others will make fewer hires and produce fewer graduates for local employers. Even before the visa ban, the government of Norway set aside money to lure away American scholars whose research has been devastated by deep Trump administration cuts to scientific research. Other countries are sure to follow. 

And if international students stop coming to the US, it will be a catastrophe for American leadership in science and technology. World-class research universities are magnets for global talent. Cambridge, Massachusetts, is a worldwide center of medical breakthroughs because Harvard and its neighbor MIT attract some of the smartest people in the world, who often stay in the United States to found new companies and conduct research. 

The same dynamic drives technology innovation around Stanford and UC Berkeley in Silicon Valley, and in university towns nationwide. If you or a loved one benefited from a new cancer treatment, there's a good chance the person who saved your life came to America on the kind of student visa the Trump administration is trying to destroy. Like printing the global reserve currency or having a good relationship with Canada, getting the pick of international students is one of those incredibly valuable things that Americans won't fully appreciate until someone is stupid enough to throw it away. 

In 2021, JD Vance told a group of movement conservatives that “we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country.” The administration has more than made good on his word, in part because the electorate is rapidly reorganizing around education attainment, with college graduates clustering in the Democratic party and nongraduates moving to the Republican side. Trump and his minions see elite colleges and universities as enemy fortresses in the culture wars, training grounds for the opposition that must be razed and broken.

Modern colleges look like the future that MAGA forces most fear. Visitors to campus today see students from scores of global communities, speaking multiple languages and practicing different cultural traditions. Places where people from other countries are welcome, and no single race, nationality, or religion reigns supreme. People like JD Vance are so terrified by this vision that they would rather destroy America's world-leading higher education system and terrorize hundreds of thousands of people who are in this country legally and only want to learn.

Elon Musk's brand catastrophe in Europe is only getting worse.

Tesla's sales collapsed 49% in Europe last month, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA), as the automaker continues to battle a brand crisis in its third-largest market.

The slump came even as sales of battery electric vehicles in Europe rose by nearly 28%, per ACEA data.

It also suggests that the refreshed version of Tesla's best-selling Model Y, which began rolling off production lines earlier this year, has so far failed to turn things around.

The backlash against CEO Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration has depressed Tesla's sales across the globe and turned the automaker into a target for protests and vandalism.

The resulting brand crisis has been exacerbated in Europe by Musk's support of the German far-right party AfD, which has seen the billionaire draw criticism from German politicians and other industry figures.

In an interview at the Qatar Economic Forum last week, Musk rebuffed suggestions that Tesla was struggling to shift its EVs, saying that other companies were also struggling in Europe and that Tesla was seeing no issues with demand.

While some of Tesla's rivals have struggled, none have seen as great a drop in sales. What's more, BMW, Renault, and VW — which overtook Tesla to become the biggest EV seller in Europe in March — have all seen their sales grow so far this year, per ACEA data.

To make matters worse for Tesla, several of the company's Chinese rivals have recorded surging sales in Europe so far this year.

State-owned auto conglomerate SAIC Motor saw its sales jump nearly 25% in April, while Tesla nemesis BYD sold more electric vehicles than Tesla in Europe for the first time last month, as it puts the automaker under pressure across the globe.

Waymo recently demonstrated why the company believes it's necessary to have lidar and other sensors beyond cameras in order to deliver a safer robotaxi service.

During a presentation at Google I/O on Wednesday, co-CEO Dmitri Dolgov showed a few situations in which Waymo's proprietary lidar and imaging radar system can detect pedestrians before cameras pick them up.

Waymo's current fifth-generation autonomous car is equipped with five lidars, six radar sensors, and 29 cameras.

One scenario involved a Waymo driving through a dust storm in Phoenix, which can occur during Arizona's monsoon season.

In one slide, Dolgov showed two frames of the same image — one of which was taken by Waymo's ""high-resolution, high dynamic range camera,"" and the other from Waymo's lidar.

The image on the right shows how Waymo's lidar can detect the presence of a pedestrian better than the robotaxi's camera. Dolgov called it the Waymo Driver's ""superhuman sensing ability.""

""You can much more clearly see there's a pedestrian standing on the side of the road,"" he said. ""So imagine they were to step onto our path. This early detection can make a really big difference in how this situation plays out.""

Another scenario Waymo showed took place in San Francisco, one of the first cities in which the company made their robotaxis publicly available.

The video shown above demonstrated how Waymo's imaging radar can detect a crossing pedestrian whose view from the robotaxi's camera feed was blocked by a bus.

Because the imaging radar relies on radio waves to detect objects and people on the road, Waymo was able to detect the presence of a pedestrian before they showed up on the cameras. The yellow dot is the imaging radar's radio waves detecting the activity of the object — in this case a human pedestrian.

The footage showed the Waymo stopping as the pedestrian walked into the middle of the road to cross the street.

The sensors ""complement each other very nicely and give us redundancy,"" Dolgov said at the presentation.

Waymo's sensors are an identifiable feature on its white Jaguar robotaxis that now hum through the thoroughfares of several major US cities. The lidars, sensors, and cameras noticeably protrude off the vehicle's exterior, including the lidar that sits on Waymo's roof like a hat.

The company, including its cofounder Sebastian Thrun, as well as many industry experts, says lidar is essential for a safe self-driving experience.

Tesla is one of the leading voices going against this conventional wisdom. The company has used lidar for limited purposes, including data collection, but for scaling robotaxis, CEO Elon Musk has characterized lidar as an expensive ""crutch.""

""The issue with Waymo's cars is it costs Waymo money,"" Musk said during Tesla's Q1 earnings call in April.

Tesla is set to compete with Waymo in June when it is set to deploy 10 to 20 robotaxis in Austin. A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

Dolgov said at the Google I/O conference that sensors merely provide ""raw, sometimes noisy measurements of the world around you.""

""It all comes down to our AI to interpret all of that data and make good driving decisions,"" he said.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa laughed off Donald Trump's Oval Office ambush, in his first direct comments since returning from the encounter with his American counterpart last week.

The lights were dimmed as Ramaphosa entered an infrastructure conference in Cape Town on Tuesday, evoking the US president's call to turn the lights down in the Oval Office to cue up a video montage that amplified his false claims of a White genocide in South Africa.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Apple Inc. shares are coming off their longest selloff in more than three years, as escalating attacks from the White House threaten to further erode the company's profit outlook, suggesting the stock's struggles this year are far from over.   

President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to levy a 25% tariff on the company's products if it doesn't shift iPhone production to the US. Shares fell 3% to end the week, their eighth straight negative session, the longest such selloff since January 2022.

AI may prove to be a powerful pedagogical tool. Simply letting students outsource their homework isn't the way.

Reading, 'riting, relying on chat prompts.

Photographer: Jeff Pachoud/AFP

For many college students these days, life is a breeze. Assignments that once demanded days of diligent research can be accomplished in minutes. Polished essays are available, on demand, for any topic under the sun. No need to trudge through Dickens or Demosthenes; all the relevant material can be instantly summarized after a single chatbot prompt.

Welcome to academia in the age of artificial intelligence. As several recent reports have shown, outsourcing one's homework to AI has become routine. Perversely, students who still put in the hard work often look worse by comparison with their peers who don't. Professors find it nearly impossible to distinguish computer-generated copy from the real thing — and, even weirder, have started using AI themselves to evaluate their students' work.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Private equity firms have seen a sharp drop in fundraising this year, the latest sign of how a slowdown in dealmaking and initial public offerings has hurt an industry that's struggling to return capital to investors amid high borrowing costs. 

PE fundraising plunged 35% to $116 billion globally in the three months through March compared to the same period in 2024, according to a study by data provider Pitchbook. The researcher said it “positions the annualized fundraising total to fall below 2024 levels” of $531 billion, which was already weaker than years past.

Circle, the issuer of the popular USDC stablecoin, has begun its long-awaited initial public offering process, looking to raise about $624 million at a valuation around $6 billion.

The company, led by CEO Jeremy Allaire, said Thursday in a filing that it plans to sell 24 million shares of Class A common stock in total – 9.6 million to be sold by the company and another another 14.4 million by existing shareholders – at an expected price range of $24 to $26 apiece, which values the company at around $5.65 billion. Circle also said it will grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 3.6 million additional shares.

Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management has indicated interest in purchasing up to $150 million of the shares, per the filing.

Shares will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker CRCL. Circle's IPO prospectus was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission at the beginning of April.

Circle's USD Coin (USDC) has roughly $62 billion in circulation and makes up about 27% of the total market cap for stablecoins, behind Tether's 67% dominance, according to CryptoQuant. Its market cap has grown 40% this year, however, compared with Tether's 10% growth.

The stablecoin sector specifically has been ramping up as the industry gains confidence that the crypto market will get its first piece of U.S. legislation passed and implemented this year, focusing on stablecoins. Last week, the Senate voted to advance the first crypto legislation, which would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Trump has said he wants to see crypto regulation on his desk and ready to sign by August before Congress goes into recess.

Circle's IPO could have investment implications for Coinbase, a cofounder of USDC and major distribution vehicle for the stablecoin. The crypto services company and exchange has a 50% revenue sharing agreement with Circle and also makes 100% of the interest earned by USDC products on the Coinbase platform. 

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has said Coinbase has a ""stretch goal"" to make USDC the number 1 stablecoin in the world.

Historically, stablecoins have been used primarily for trading and as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi), and crypto investors watch them closely for evidence of demand, liquidity and activity in the market. More recently, their ability to move dollars quickly and cheaply across borders has become more popular with banks and fintech companies.

Additionally, rhetoric around their ability to help preserve U.S. dollar dominance – by exporting dollar utility internationally and ensuring demand for U.S. government debt, which backs nearly all dollar-denominated stablecoins – has grown louder.

In this article

Walmart agreed to pay a small fine and promised to ensure its third-party resellers are unable to sell realistic looking toy guns to buyers in New York, after state Attorney General Letitia James said Tuesday that the retail giant's online store shipped them to the state.

The settlement comes nearly a decade after Walmart, Amazon, Sears and other retailers entered into a consent order and judgment with New York's previous attorney general, in which they agreed to keep toy guns that resemble actual deadly weapons off their shelves statewide and they paid civil penalties that topped $300,000.

The 2015 order was part of a nationwide reckoning over realistic looking toy guns in the wake of the fatal shooting of Tamir Rice, a 12 year-old Cleveland boy who was killed by police in November 2014 while holding a pellet gun.

The New York law bans retailers from selling or shipping toy guns of certain colors — black, dark blue, silver, or aluminum — that look like real weapons.

Toy guns sold in the state must be ""made in bright colors or made entirely of transparent or translucent materials,"" with businesses subject to a fine of $1,000 per violation, according to James' office.

James said on Tuesday that an investigation by her office found that Walmart's online store had shipped at least nine realistic looking toy guns sold by third-party sellers to New York City, Westchester County and Western New York.

But the investigation also found that between March 2020 and November 2023, at least 46 imitation weapons that violate New York state law were purchased by consumers in the state through the Walmart.com platform, the settlement revealed.

""Realistic-looking toy guns can put communities in serious danger and that is why they are banned in New York,"" James said in a statement.

""Walmart failed to prevent its third-party sellers from selling realistic-looking toy guns to New York addresses, violating our laws and putting people at risk,"" she said.

""The ban on realistic-looking toy guns is meant to keep New Yorkers safe and my office will not hesitate to hold any business that violates that law accountable.""

Walmart must pay $14,000 in penalties and $2,000 in fees under the settlement, the AG's office said.

CNBC has requested comment from Walmart, which neither admitted nor denied the findings by James' office in its investigation.

As part of the settlement, Walmart is required to prohibit third parties from offering for sale or selling any of the imitation guns covered by the state law to buyers in New York.

""Walmart shall terminate the ability of a third party from being able to list and sell toy guns and imitation weapons on Walmart.com when it has determined that a third party has engaged in conduct"" that violates that restriction on three separate occasions, the settlement said.

And ""Walmart shall implement and maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent such third parties from offering for sale, exposing for sale, or selling Prohibited Items on Walmart.com for importation, holding for sale, or distribution to New York,"" the settlement says.

In this article

Japan's Nippon Steel is expected to close its acquisition of U.S. Steel for $55 per share, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC's David Faber.

President Donald Trump cleared Nippon's bid for U.S. Steel on Friday, referring to the deal as a ""partnership."" Trump said Nippon will invest $14 billion over the next 14 months. U.S. Steel's headquarters will remain in Pittsburgh, the president said.

U.S. Steel shares were up more than 1% on Tuesday. The $55 per share bid for U.S. Steel is the offer that Nippon originally made for the company before the deal was blocked in January.

President Joe Biden had blocked Nippon's bid for U.S. Steel on national security grounds, arguing that the deal will potentially jeopardize critical supply chains. But Trump ordered a new review of the proposed acquisition in April, despite his previous opposition to Nippon acquiring U.S. Steel.

The United Steelworkers union had opposed Nippon's bid to acquire U.S. Steel. USW President David McCall said Friday that the union ""cannot speculate about the impact"" of Trump's announcement ""without more information.""

""Our concern remains that Nippon, a foreign corporation with a long and proven track record of violating our trade laws, will further erode domestic steelmaking capacity and jeopardize thousands of good, union jobs,"" McCall said in a statement.

Trump told reporters on Sunday that the deal is an ""investment, it's a partial ownership, but it will be controlled by the USA."" Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick told CNBC on Tuesday that U.S. Steel will have an American CEO and a majority of its board members will be from the U.S.

""It's a national security agreement that will be signed with the U.S. government,"" McCormick told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""There'll be a golden share that will essentially require U.S. government approval of a number of the board members and that will allow the United States to ensure production levels aren't cut.""

The $14 billion that Nippon will invest includes $2.4 billion that will go to U.S. Steel's operations at Mon Valley outside Pittsburgh, McCormick said. The deal will save 10,000 jobs in Pennsylvania and add another 10,000 jobs in the building trades to add another arc furnace, the senator said.

When asked what Nippon gets from the deal, McCormick said the Japanese steelmaker will ""have certainly members of the board and this will be part of their overall corporate structure.""

""They wanted an opportunity to get access to the U.S. market — this allowed them to do so and get the economic benefit of that,"" McCormick said of Nippon. ""They've negotiated it, it was their proposal.""

Trump said Friday he will hold a rally at U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh on May 30.

In this article

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Tuesday that the Trump administration does not want to ""harm Apple"" with tariffs.

""Everybody is trying to make it seem like it's a catastrophe if there's a tiny little tariff on them right now, to try to negotiate down the tariffs,"" Hassett told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday. ""In the end, we'll see what happens, we'll see what the update is, but we don't want to harm Apple.""

Hassett's comments come after President Donald Trump said in a social media post that Apple will have to pay a tariff of 25% or more for iPhones made outside the U.S. Apple has historically manufactured its products in foreign countries including China, India and Vietnam.

""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" Trump wrote in the post. ""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank your for your attention to this matter!""

By some estimates, a U.S.-made iPhone could cost as much as $3,500.

""If you think that Apple has a factory some place that's got a set number of iPhones that it produces and it needs to sell them no matter what, then Apple will bear those tariffs, not consumers, because it's an elastic supply,"" Hassett said.

Hasset's comments continue the administration's push to pressure companies to shoulder the cost burden of Trump's tariffs, instead of raising prices for consumers.

Earlier this month, Trump told retail giant Walmart to ""EAT THE TARIFFS"" after the company warned it would have to pass those added costs on.

Shares of Apple were up more than 1% on Tuesday.

Apple did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

In this article

Salesforce said Tuesday that it's buying cloud data management company Informatica in an $8 billion deal to bolster the software vendor's push into artificial intelligence.

Shares of Salesforce were up 1% on Tuesday. Informatica stock climbed more than 5%.

""Truly autonomous, trustworthy AI agents need the most comprehensive understanding of their data,"" said Steve Fisher, Salesforce president and chief technology officer, in a release announcing the deal. ""The combination of Informatica's advanced catalog and metadata capabilities with our Agentforce platform delivers exactly this.""

Under the terms of the deal, holders of Informatica's Class A and Class B-1 common stock will receive $25 in cash per share, according to the release.

Bloomberg reported Friday that the companies were in talks about a deal. The report sent shares of Informatica up more than 17%.

Salesforce, which specializes in customer relationship management software, said it would look to combine Informatica's data catalog, integration, governance, privacy and data management services with its agentic AI solution, dubbed Agentforce.

The deal will be funded through a combination of cash on Salesforce's and new debt, the company said.

The acquisition adds to a slew of deals Salesforce has made over the years as the company has sought to expand its product portfolio and gain market share. It bought Slack in 2021 for $27.7 billion, Tableau in 2019 for $15.7 billion and MuleSoft in 2018 for $6.5 billion.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said Tuesday that the company would look to use Informatica alongside its Data Cloud, MuleSoft and Tableau products to ""enable autonomous agents to deliver smarter, safer, and more scalable outcomes for every company.""

National Public Radio on Tuesday sued President Donald Trump over his executive order to cease all federal funding for the nonprofit broadcaster.

Trump's May 1 order violates the First Amendment's protections of speech and the press and steps on Congress' authority, NPR and three other public radio stations wrote in the lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, D.C.

The order ""also threatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information,"" according to the legal complaint against Trump and a handful of top officials and federal agencies.

NPR and three of its member stations — Colorado Public Radio, Aspen Public Radio and KSUT Public Radio — want Trump's order permanently blocked and declared unconstitutional.

It ""expressly aims to punish and control Plaintiffs' news coverage and other speech the Administration deems 'biased,'"" attorneys for the news outlets wrote. ""It cannot stand.""

NPR and the Public Broadcasting Service, or PBS, had previously vowed to challenge Trump's order, which asserts that government funding of the news is ""not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence.""

Founded in 1970, NPR says it employs hundreds of journalists whose work is broadcast by more than 1,000 local stations. While most of its initial funding was allocated by Congress and delivered through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, or CPB, the arrangement was changed in the 1980s as the Reagan Administration sought to shrink public media funding.

Now, the CPB sends federal money to local member stations, who then buy NPR programming. Those member station fees comprise 30% of NPR's funding, while just 1% of NPR's revenue comes directly from the federal government, according to the organization. The largest share of its funding, 36%, comes from corporate sponsorship, NPR says.

The CPB ""is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime,"" White House spokesman Harrison Fields said in a statement to CNBC.

""Therefore, the President is exercising his lawful authority to limit funding to NPR and PBS. The President was elected with a mandate to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and he will continue to use his lawful authority to achieve that objective,"" Fields said.

The lawsuit argues that Congress has long recognized that the speech it supports with public funding ""remains private—and thus fully protected from censorship, retaliation or other forms of governmental interference.""

""Yet the President—criticizing what he perceives as 'bias' in the award-winning journalism and cultural programming produced by NPR—has issued an Executive Order that thwarts Congress's intent and the First Amendment rights of Plaintiffs to be free from the government's attempts to control their private speech, and their rights to be free from retaliation aimed at punishing and chilling protected speech, journalistic activities, and expressive association,"" the attorneys wrote.

""The Order is textbook retaliation and viewpoint-based discrimination in violation of the First Amendment,"" they wrote.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the lawsuit.

A European-wide shift to nuclear power appears to be gathering momentum as countries hedge their bets in pursuit of more energy independence.

In just the last few weeks, Denmark announced plans to reconsider a 40-year ban on nuclear power as part of a major policy shift, Spain reportedly signaled an openness to review a shutdown of its nuclear plants and Germany dropped its long-held opposition to atomic power.

The renewed European interest in nuclear shows how some countries are hedging their bets in pursuit of more energy independence.

The burgeoning trend appears to be driven, at least in part, by some of the costs associated with renewables, notably solar and wind technologies.

""Solar and wind are still the cheapest and fastest way to drive the green transition, and that remains our focus. But we also need to understand whether new nuclear technologies can play a supporting role,"" Lars Aagaard, Denmark's minister for climate, energy and utilities, told CNBC via email.

The renewables-heavy Scandinavian country said in mid-May that it plans to analyze the potential benefits and risks of new advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors, to complement solar and wind technologies.

Denmark's government, which banned the use of atomic energy in 1985, added that it does not plan a return to traditional nuclear power plants.

""We have no recent experience with nuclear power, and we lack the necessary knowledge regarding safety and waste management. That's why we must begin a serious analysis — not to replace solar and wind, but to see whether new nuclear can complement our energy system in the future,"" Aagaard said.

Georg Zachmann, senior fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank, said nuclear power remains the most divisive electricity generation technology in Europe.

""Thereby, the renaissance of nuclear in the political discourse is somewhat surprising, given that the cost of main competing technologies, new wind and solar plants, have dropped by more than 80 percent, while those of nuclear plants have rather increased,"" Zachmann said.

The so-called ""hidden cost"" of balancing and transporting electricity from renewables has been increasing with rising shares of wind and solar generation, Zachmann said, noting that this theme has recently become more apparent.

Spain signaled its openness to atomic energy late last month. In an interview reported by Bloomberg, Spanish Environmental Transition Minister Sara Aagesen said that while the government is proceeding with plans to retire nuclear energy reactors over the next decade, extensions beyond 2035 could not be ruled out.

Aagsen said at the time that the government was not considering anything, and no specific proposals had yet been tabled.

Widely regarded as anti-nuclear power, the southern European country has been mired in a blackout blame game over green energy in recent weeks. It follows a catastrophic power outage affecting much of Spain, Portugal and the south of France.

Some external observers have flagged renewables and net-zero emissions targets as possible reasons for the outage, particularly given Spain and Portugal both rely on high levels of wind and solar for their electricity grid.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and the country's grid operator Red Electrica de Espana (REE), however, have both said record levels of renewable energy were not at fault for the blackout.

Germany, which closed the last of its three remaining nuclear plants in 2023, recently scrapped its opposition to nuclear power in what marked a rapprochement with France.

Led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, the newly elected government was said to have dropped its objection to French efforts to ensure that nuclear power is treated on a par with renewables in EU legislation, the Financial Times reported on May 19, citing French and German officials.

Spokespeople for France and Germany's respective governments were not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC.

As it is low-carbon, advocates argue that nuclear power has the potential to play a significant role in helping countries generate electricity while slashing emissions and reducing their reliance on fossil fuels.

Some environmental groups, however, say the nuclear industry is an expensive and harmful distraction to cheaper and cleaner alternatives.

Bruegel's Zachmann said the ability of fully depreciated nuclear power plants to continue operating much beyond their lifetime, as well as the ""highly uncertain"" hope that next-generation small modular reactors ""can be built very cheaply captures the imagination of industry and policymakers.""

In all likelihood, Zachmann said ""new nuclear power plants will remain difficult to finance and will at very best only pay off in decades. In the meantime, the discussion whether to prefer nuclear or renewables only helps natural gas — that continues to be burnt as long as investments in clean electricity do not happen at scale.""

Data published by energy think tank Ember found that the EU's electricity system continued a rapid shift toward renewables in the first half of last year. Indeed, wind and solar power rose to record highs over the six-month period, reaching a share of 30% of the bloc's electricity generation and overtaking fossil fuels for the first time.

Alongside renewables growth, Ember said at the time that nuclear generation across the EU increased by 3.1%.

But Trump, Beijing won't make further growth easy","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/27/indias-iphone-exports-to-the-us-soared-an-estimated-76percent-in-april.html","Tue, 27 May 2025 09:52:40 GMT","



In this article

Shipments of iPhones from India to the U.S. rose 76% in April year on year, estimates from a technology market analyst firm shows. The surge comes as Apple accelerates its ""made in India"" plans, which analysts say will meet pushback from President Donald Trump and Beijing.

The data from Canalys, now part of Omdia, showed that U.S. iPhones shipped from India in April reached roughly 3,000,000. That's a stark contrast to shipments from China over the same period, which fell about 76% from last year to just 900,000. 

According to Le Xuan Chiew, a research manager at Omdia, the April numbers show the aggressive measures Apple has taken to adapt to Washington's tariffs against China, where Apple manufactures most of its iPhones.

""This latest trade war with China, is the type of disturbance that Apple has long been trying to prepare itself for,"" he said, adding that the country had first started investing heavily into supply chains in India during the Covid-19 pandemic. 

India also surpassed China in iPhone shipments to the United States in March, according to Omdia's estimates. The uptick came ahead of Trump's first iteration of ""reciprocal tariffs"" on April 2. The amount of shipments that month was unusually high and appeared to be the result of the company's stockpiling, according to Chiew.

The Trump administration's decision to exempt iPhones and other consumer electronics from his reciprocal tariffs on April 11 did not reverse those trends, with Apple CEO Tim Cook in early may reiterating plans for most iPhone's sold in the U.S. to be manufactured in India. 

IPhones imported from China under Trump's current term tariffs still face an additional 30% of duties, while the baseline tariff rate is currently 10% for most other countries, including India. 

While the jump in India's iPhone shipments in March and April showed the adaptability of Apple's supply chains, that growth is expected to slow down for the rest of the year, according to Omdia's Chiew.

""India's manufacturing capacity isn't expected to grow fast enough to take the entirety of U.S. demand. It's still too early,"" he said, noting that the company recently began shipments of Apple's most cutting-edge iPhone 16 Pro.

Omdia estimates that U.S. iPhone demand is about 20 million a quarter, with India expected to be able to match that level only by 2026. 

Meanwhile, Daniel Newman, CEO and principal analyst at research firm Futurum Group, noted that shipment numbers reflect final assembly, but are not representative of the entire supply chain and manufacturing process. 

""It was actually a very low lift for them to migrate more and more of the final assembly from China to India,"" he said, adding that a vast majority of the sub-assemblies are all still in China.

Analysts said India's ability to expand its iPhone capacity could be curbed by protectionist measures from Washington and Beijing, which both have issues with Apple's reaction against tariffs.

According to Newman, while this is the smart thing for Apple to do, it's also playing a ""dangerous game"" with Trump, as it doesn't meet the objectives of his administration's tariffs. 

On Friday, Trump threatened to slap a 25% tariff on all iPhone shipments in a social media post, reiterating that he expects iPhones sold in the U.S. to be manufactured and built domestically, ""not India, or anyplace else.""

China, for its part, is not expected to make it easy for Apple to diversify out of the country, Newman said, adding that the company has served as trade leverage for Beijing.

According to reports from local outlets in India, Beijing has tried to make it harder for the country to access the high-tech machinery and talent from China needed to further support Apple's suppliers in India. 

Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC that Apple's India plans will pose some challenges regarding logistics, distribution and navigating complex supply chains in the country. However, India is nevertheless expected to remain a ""life raft"" for Apple under the tariff situation.

""Producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale in our view and Apple will continue to plow ahead on the India path. Cook will look to negotiate with Trump but India is the focus and not changing.""

In this article

European sales of Tesla vehicles plunged in April, as the U.S. electric car maker continues to face reputational damage regionally and rising competition.

Tesla sold 7,261 cars in Europe in April, down 49% year on year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or ACEA. That drop came even as overall battery electric car sales rose 34.1% annually in April.

Tesla has faced brand damage over the past few months because of CEO Elon Musk's political involvement with U.S. President Donald Trump, with protests erupting at Tesla dealerships across Europe in March.

Tesla sales tanked nearly 40% year on year over the January-April period.

The company launched an upgraded version of its Model Y sport utility vehicle this year, but its overall lineup of cars is still ageing, with no new mass-market offering unveiled to date.

At the same time, Tesla continues to battle rising competition from traditional automakers as well as aggressive Chinese players. Last week, separate data showed auto giant BYD sold more pure electric cars in Europe than Tesla for the first time.

European consumers are also showing a preference for hybrid electric vehicles — cars with a small battery that still mainly run on traditional fuel. Hybrid electric vehicles account for just over 35% of the total European car market, ACEA data showed.

Tesla does not have any hybrid electric cars on the market, only selling full battery-powered vehicles.

Investors have questioned Musk's dedication to Tesla because of his time advising Trump and his role leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Musk said on the most recent Tesla earnings call that his time spent running DOGE would drop significantly by the end of May, but that he plans to dedicate a ""day or two per week"" to government work.

The tech billionaire added in a recent public speech that he is committed to leading Tesla for the next five years.

They might be made of the hardest material on earth, but diamonds, with their complex supply chains and expensive price tag, are particularly fragile to U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff agenda. 

The precious mineral is facing a baseline 10% import duty to the U.S. — a market accounting for over half of the global demand for polished diamonds. The sector is also bracing for additional duties should Trump's 90-day pause come to an end with no new agreements. 

""It's very clear that the diamond industry, on a global level, has been facing a perfect storm of challenges,"" Karen Rentmeesters, chief executive of the Antwerp World Diamond Centre told CNBC, adding that tariffs are just ""the latest blow."" 

The small precious stones often cross several borders before ending in a store. From mines in Botswana or South Africa, to trading hubs in the Middle East or Europe, and then on to cutting and polishing hubs, before heading back to a jewelry manufacturer — there is often a long journey before the item arrives in a store. This complex supply chain means the diamond industry is highly susceptible to any trade disruptions.  

Raw materials such as gold and copper have been excluded from U.S. tariffs and the industry is pushing for diamonds to also be excluded. 

Rentmeesters who heads the 580-year-old corporation which represents over 1,400 companies within Antwerp's diamond district, said: ""You could argue that loose diamonds are a raw material. You don't walk around with a polished diamond in your hand. You're wearing it in a piece of jewelry. It's in a ring or a pair of earrings."" 

The tariff uncertainty comes at a time when the luxury industry at large is already contending with a slowdown in demand after a post-pandemic boom and an economic slump in China.  

However, the biggest disruption to the industry has been the creation of lab-grown diamonds (LGD). Chemically identical, the stones are impossible to distinguish with the naked eye. They are selling at an 80% discount to the natural version and customers are taking advantage of the cheaper prices.   

Over half of couples surveyed in the U.S. last year, said their engagement ring featured a lab-grown diamond, according to the 2025 Real Weddings study by The Knot which included insights from nearly 17,000 couples.  

A watershed moment was in 2021 when Pandora, the world's largest jewelry brand by volume, became the first to stop selling mined diamonds.  

""In the US, some 18 months ago, the volume of lab-grown diamonds in loose stones surpassed that of mined. So if there's any doubt in people's minds that there's a shift going on, it was very visible from there, and since then, it keeps on growing,"" Pandora CEO Alexander Lacik told CNBC.  

""With this type of value proposition that lab grown diamonds can offer, we can actually offer diamonds to more people. So it's not necessarily that we see that the total volume of diamonds is going to go down. We'll probably invite more people into the category."" 

With the poor macroeconomic conditions and increasing competition from LGD, the price of mined diamonds has fallen nearly 60% since a peak in March 2022. 

However, some analysts say the industry is close to reaching a point of stabilization between LGD and mined diamonds. ""The question you have to ask is, how much lower can prices go before consumers see clear differentiation between the two products,"" said Paul Zimnisky, an independent diamond analyst. 

He added: ""And I think we're finally starting to get to that point where you could buy, you know, a three, four or five carat, which are ridiculous sizes for an engagement ring — you could buy the lab grown version for, you know, just a few $1,000 whereas the natural version is going to be tens of hundreds of thousands of dollars. So, I think that price differential is certainly creating distinction.""

In the face of these challenges, some key players are rethinking their strategies. 

De Beers, a major player in the diamond industry, said there were signs of an uptake in U.S. demand before Christmas and before the tariff uncertainty hit. Instead of investing in the burgeoning market of LGD, DeBeers is doubling down on natural diamonds. 

De Beers recently announced it will close its LGD jewelry brand Lightbox in a bid to reinforce ""its commitment to natural diamonds in the jewelry sector."" 

""The persistently declining value of lab-grown diamonds in jewelry underscores the growing differentiation between these factory-made products and natural diamonds,"" De Beers CEO Al Cook said in a company statement. 

The firm said the closure is aligned with the strategy it presented in May last year, ""to focus on high-return activities and streamline the business."" 

The closure also comes at a time when Anglo American, De Beers' parent company, is divesting the company and is in the process of looking for potential buyers. 

In the current luxury slowdown jewelry has been a notable bright spot, especially the high-jewelry segment, seen as less cyclical catering to the most affluent clientele. 

Earlier this month, Richemont beat expectations with revenues boosted by double-digit growth at the group's Jewellery Maisons division, which includes Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels and Buccellati.

According to analysts, the key for the mined industry going forward is in the messaging: ""You have to remember a diamond, it's a very emotional purchase. It's not a practical purchase. And people like the story behind the creation,"" Zimnisky said.  

""I just think it's up to the industry to provide consumers with the confidence they need if they're going to spend significantly more for a natural diamond, they want to make sure it's definitely a natural diamond. I think that should be the industry's priority at this point.""

French President Emmanuel Macron visiting Vietnam and Swedish automaker Volvo Cars laying off employees might not appear to have much in common.

But they are, on some level, strategic maneuvers in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's deployment of 50% tariffs on the European Union, which he later delayed.

Macron sealed a deal with Vietnam for the Asian country to buy 20 jets from European planemaker Airbus, building on an earlier agreement for a similar quantity.

And Volvo Cars' layoffs reflected growing pressure on the company to cut costs. The Swedish automaker has already pulled a China-made car completely out of the U.S. markets because of Trump's tariffs on Beijing. The company, which is owned by China's Geely Holding, also withdrew its financial guidance for both 2025 and 2026, citing tariff pressure on the automotive sector.

Hence, while there may be sighs of relief in Brussels for now, Trump's tariff bluster will continue to roil the global economy and investor confidence.

European auto stocks reboundU.S. futures jumped Monday night stateside on Trump's delay of 50% tariffs on the European Union. Markets were closed Monday for the Memorial Day holiday. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 index added 0.99%, with all sectors in positive territory. European auto stocks rebounded from a 3% loss in the previous session to close 1.7% higher on Monday following news of the tariff postponement.

Rocky path ahead despite EU tariff delayInvestors cheered Trump's delay of tariffs on the EU, driving U.S. futures and European markets higher. However, analysts are warning not to let optimism run unchecked. Berenberg Chief Economist Holger Schmieding told CNBC that even if a deal was struck to reduce import duties from the EU to 20% or 30%, ""the EU would have no choice"" but to impose ""significant countermeasures"" against the United States.

Vietnam agrees to buy 20 Airbus jetsDuring French President Emmanuel Macron's state visit to Vietnam — the first by a French president in almost 10 years — the two countries signed an agreement to buy 20 Airbus A330neo planes, vaccines from French pharmaceutical company Sanofi and cooperate on nuclear energy, reported Reuters, citing a list of documents it had seen.

Volvo announces layoffsSweden-based automaker Volvo Cars on Monday said it would cut around 3,000 jobs, mostly office-based positions in Sweden, as part of a major cost-cutting drive. The move comes after the company, which is owned by China's Geely Holding, announced an 18 billion Swedish kronor ($1.89 billion) cost and cash action plan late last month.

In this edition of CNBC Meets, Cher speaks to Tania Bryer about the ambition that drove her success, activism and why her next album might be her last.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","The ultra-rich are increasingly parking their gold in Singapore as global risks and Trump volatility mount","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/27/the-ultra-rich-are-moving-gold-to-singapore-as-global-risks-mount.html","Tue, 27 May 2025 01:12:00 GMT","



The ultra-wealthy are increasingly moving their gold offshore as economic and geopolitical uncertainty roils markets — and Singapore is emerging as a favored destination.

Not far from the city-state's airport sits a six-story facility covered in onyx and fortified by tight security. Tucked behind its steel doors are gold and silver bars amounting to about $1.5 billion.

Known as ""The Reserve,"" the storage facility features scores of private vaults and a towering storage chamber lined with thousands of safe deposit boxes reaching three stories high.

From the start of the year to April, the precious metals repository has received an 88% increase in orders to store gold and silver in the vault from the same period in 2024, said its founder, Gregor Gregersen. The Reserve, which also sells gold and silver bars, saw sales for precious metals bars skyrocket 200% year on year in that time, data provided by The Reserve showed.

A growing sense of unease is driving the surge, according to industry watchers.

""A lot of very high net worth clients are looking at tariffs, looking at the world changing, looking at the potential of geopolitical instabilities,"" Gregersen told CNBC. 

""The idea of putting physical metal in a safe jurisdiction like Singapore with parties they can trust is becoming a big trend nowadays,"" he said, adding that 90% of the new orders are coming from outside of Singapore.

The rise of gold has been meteoric in recent months, with bullion prices notching consecutive record highs. That was fueled in part by its safe haven appeal in the face of the volatility brought about by U.S.-China trade tensions and a mass U.S. asset sell-off in April.

Though gold prices recently cooled after investors' risk appetites improved following a thaw in trade tensions between the two economic superpowers, some market watchers still believe they could climb to as high as $5,000 per ounce next year. Spot gold prices are currently trading at $3,346.32 per ounce, near historic levels.

The wealthy are also increasingly opting for physical gold bars instead of paper because they do not want as much counterparty and geopolitical risks, Gregersen said. While storing and owning physical gold isn't completely free of price exposure, it limits exposure to certain risks that paper gold carries.

For example, counterparty risks are lower if one owns the asset directly. The Silicon Valley Bank crisis that unfolded in 2023 fueled investors' preference for physically owning or securely allocating specific gold bars, instead of relying on paper claims or owning just a stake in a pooled reserve — which could be put at risk if a bank collapses, said Nicky Shiels, head of research and metals strategy at MKS Pamp, a precious metals refining and trading firm.

The World Gold Council's chief market strategist John Reade likewise noted that this is especially the case for those who are worried about the health of the global financial system.

""Some holders of physical precious metals are wary of storing gold within the banking system, even in allocated form, so they prefer to hold gold with entities that are not banks,"" Reade said.

Lack of trust in some domestic banks is also a key driver, said Jeremy Savory, founder of Millionaire Migrant, a Dubai-based consultancy that provides citizenship-related services to high-net-worth individuals.

""If you're in a country where you don't trust the banking system, for example, Lebanon or Egypt or Algeria … they don't want to put it in the bank,"" said Savory, whose clients include high-net-worth individuals around the world who are trying to move physical gold to vaults in Switzerland, Singapore and Dubai.

That said, vaulted gold may be less attractive for short-term investors, given that the transaction costs for purchasing and moving physical gold is higher than that of paper gold, said World Gold Council's Reade.

But why store them in Singapore specifically?

""Singapore is viewed as the 'Geneva of the East'; it has a reputation as a safe jurisdiction with relative political and economic stability,"" Shiels said.

The Southeast Asian nation's role as a key transit hub also makes it an attractive and convenient place for the wealthy to park their gold.

""Singapore is a transit hub. Anywhere that is a transit hub, usually makes sense that there's a gold vault,"" said Savory. ""You can bank, you can store your gold there, but you can also pick it up [easily] because it's a transit hub. And this is where Switzerland is losing out,"" he added.

In this article

LAS VEGAS — Jack Dorsey's latest bitcoin vision is hitting the checkout counter — starting with a merch truck parked just off the casino floor inside The Venetian.

This week at Bitcoin 2025, Square is piloting real-time bitcoin payments, letting attendees scan and spend crypto for T-shirts, hoodies, and hats at the BTC Inc. pop-up store. The system runs on Lightning, which settles transactions off the main blockchain and is faster and cheaper than traditional processing methods.

When customers scan the QR code at checkout, Square handles things behind the scenes, including real-time exchange rates and confirmation.

The Tuesday launch marks the public debut of Block's most ambitious move yet to make bitcoin ""everyday money"" — a pilot that's expected to expand from the Vegas Strip to millions of merchants around the world.

Behind it all is Miles Suter, a longtime product leader at Block, who flew in early to oversee setup with his team.

Suter joined the company in 2017, when Cash App's bitcoin integration was still a hackweek experiment.

""They needed someone with deep familiarity with bitcoin and the community,"" he said, calling himself ""an early evangelist.""

Eight years later, he's helping ""connect the Blocks"" — working across Cash App, Spiral, Bitkey, and Square to embed bitcoin into every layer of the company's ecosystem. The Square rollout, he says, is a natural next step.

Block expects to begin offering bitcoin payments to eligible Square sellers later this year, with full availability targeted for 2026, pending regulatory approval.

The launch comes as bitcoin trades near all-time highs, a surge driven largely by the ""digital gold"" narrative that positions it as a long-term store of value rather than a day-to-day medium of exchange.

At the same time, stablecoin legislation is advancing in Congress, and more fintech giants are aligning behind tokenized dollars. 

Block is taking a different path — one that centers on bitcoin.

Suter said the company's strategy is rooted in the belief that a decentralized, permissionless currency remains critical to the future of the internet — and that bitcoin is still the best candidate to fill that role.

Asked about the lingering perception that bitcoin is better suited for holding than spending, Suter pointed to a familiar pattern. When Cash App first introduced bitcoin trading, he said, it was met with hesitation and doubt.

""But again, somebody's got to be first,"" he said. ""And we feel like we have the right DNA to push things forward.""

He called the new Square rollout ""a really significant milestone"" in Block's broader mission to make bitcoin more accessible and usable.

The product builds on Square's ""Bitcoin Conversions"" tool, launched last year, which lets merchants automatically convert a portion of their daily sales into bitcoin. Block says it has rolled out the feature to more than 1,000 sellers so far — and those who opted in have seen their bitcoin holdings grow by roughly 70% over the past year.

This latest feature goes a step further, enabling sellers to accept bitcoin directly at the point of sale.

For businesses that don't want to hold bitcoin, there's no exposure risk. Payments can be instantly converted to dollars.

""If you just want to have it as another payment method — like Amex, MasterCard, or Visa — bitcoin is now potentially another option for you,"" Suter said.

For those that do want to hold it, Block is building out what Suter calls a ""Bitcoin for Business"" stack — a full suite of tools to accept, convert, manage, and self-custody bitcoin.

""If you do want to accept it as bitcoin,"" he said, ""we give you a full suite of products to manage that as you see fit. That means being able to convert your daily sales, buy and sell from your U.S. dollar balance into bitcoin, and withdraw to self-custody at any time. It's about giving our merchants more options and making sure they never miss a sale.""

The announcement comes amid renewed attention on corporate bitcoin strategy, as some publicly traded firms adopt the cryptocurrency as a treasury reserve asset. But Block is targeting a different segment of the market.

""There's a lot of talk about corporate bitcoin right now,"" Suter said. ""But like we did on Cash App — which is very much about the little guy and bringing accessibility to everyone — we want small and medium-sized merchants to also be able to get the benefits of bitcoin.""

While Block hasn't released specific metrics yet, Suter said merchants who participated in the Bitcoin Conversions pilot have all profited. ""Every single seller is in the money and has made money based on converting a certain percentage of their daily sales,"" he said.

Square's bitcoin push joins a broader ecosystem at Block that includes Bitkey, its self-custody wallet; Proto, a line of bitcoin mining hardware and software; Spiral, its open-source development arm; and Cash App's bitcoin trading functionality.

""We're focused on making bitcoin everyday currency,"" Suter said. ""We believe that the internet needs a native currency, and that's where all our focus has been today.""

Ethereum ETH$2,673.58 has staged an impressive recovery in the past 24 hours, climbing 3.8% amid significant market volatility. The second-largest cryptocurrency found solid support at $2,530, where exceptional trading volume (242,521 ETH) created a clear bottoming pattern. 

This was followed by a decisive breakout during the early trading hours, supported by massive volume surges exceeding 550,000 ETH that pushed prices above key resistance levels. 

The recent price action confirms a short-term trend reversal, with ETH now trading above $2,575 after establishing new local highs. Institutional interest remains robust, with spot Ethereum ETFs recording $248 million in total net inflows over the past week, suggesting growing confidence from larger investors despite relatively subdued retail participation. 

Market analysts point to the $2,800 level as a critical resistance zone where many investors who previously bought at that level may look to exit at break-even. However, with ETH breaking out of its recent consolidation pattern and the broader crypto market showing signs of strength, bulls are now targeting the $2,650-$2,745 range as the next significant hurdle.

 SharpLink Gaming announced a $425 million private equity deal to launch an Ether treasury and appointed Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as board chairman. 

Betting platform SharpLink Gaming has launched an Ethereum-based corporate treasury strategy and nominated Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as chairman of its board of directors, the company announced May 27.

According to the announcement, SharpLink Gaming, a publicly traded company on Nasdaq, entered into a securities purchase agreement for a private investment in public equity worth $425 million. Ethereum infrastructure firm Consensys was among the investors.

“On close, Consensys looks forward to partnering with SharpLink to explore and develop an Ethereum Treasury Strategy and to work with them in their core business as a strategic advisor,” Consensys founder and CEO Lubin said.

SharpLink Gaming's stock is up approximately 400% at the time of writing, changing hands at nearly $33.50. Trading today started at over $30 after closing under $7 the day before.

A Consensys representative told Cointelegraph that the company will not comment further until the deal is closed. Still, they confirmed Consensys' investment in SharpLink Gaming.

Alongside Consensys, the investors include venture capital firms ParaFi Capital, Electric Capital, Pantera Capital, Arrington Capital, Galaxy Digital, Ondo, White Star Capital, GSR, Hivemind Capital, Hypersphere and Primitive Ventures. SharpLink CEO Rob Phythian and the firm's CEO Robert DeLucia also participated.

The deal is expected to close “on or about May 29” if the customary closing conditions are satisfied. SharpLink Gaming intends to use the newly raised funds to jumpstart its Ether (ETH) treasury and for other general corporate purposes:

Corporate crypto treasuries are on the rise, but most of them are focused on Bitcoin (BTC). One exception was Meitu, the developer of popular Photoshop-like apps, but the company liquidated its 940 Bitcoin and 31,000 Ether at the end of last year.

Other notable examples include the Canadian subsidiary of Big Four auditor KPMG adding Ether to its treasury alongside Bitcoin in February 2022. Also, Hong Kong-based gaming firm Boyaa Interactive International held ETH, but at the end of 2024, it replaced Ether with Bitcoin.

Social media giant Reddit also acquired both Bitcoin and Ethereum, but the company was reported to have offloaded most of its holdings in late 2024. Publicly traded company BTCS also announced a $57.8 million financing agreement to purchase Ether earlier this month.

SharpLink's $425M fundraise to adopt Ethereum as treasury reserve represents a significant strategic pivot with major crypto industry backing.

SharpLink Gaming's announcement of a $425 million private placement represents a dramatic strategic shift for this online performance-based marketing company. The company is effectively implementing a Bitcoin-style treasury strategy but with Ethereum instead, positioning ETH as its ""primary treasury reserve asset."" This is a significant capital allocation decision that far exceeds the typical operational needs of a marketing services company.

What makes this particularly notable is the investment consortium. The round is led by Consensys Software (founded by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin) and includes participation from nearly every major cryptocurrency venture capital firm including ParaFi, Electric Capital, Pantera, Galaxy Digital and others. This level of participation signals strong crypto industry confidence in this strategy.

The $6.15 per share pricing ($6.72 for management) represents a specific valuation decision point that the crypto investment community has deemed appropriate. More importantly, Joseph Lubin joining as Chairman creates a direct connection to Ethereum's founding team, suggesting this isn't merely a passive investment strategy but potentially a deeper strategic integration.

This treasury strategy essentially transforms SharpLink into a publicly-traded vehicle with significant Ethereum exposure. While the company states it will continue its core business serving sports betting and iGaming industries, this move effectively creates a new investment thesis for the stock as an Ethereum proxy on public markets - similar to how MicroStrategy has become a Bitcoin proxy. The distinction is that SharpLink appears to have attracted significant backing from Ethereum ecosystem insiders, suggesting possible additional strategic developments beyond simply holding ETH in treasury.

SharpLink continues its online performance-based marketing company serving the U.S. sports betting and global iGaming industries

Ethereum (ETH) is up 4% on Tuesday following Sharplink Gaming's plan to raise $425 million in a private placement, led by Consensys, to purchase ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset.

Sharplink Gaming is set to incorporate Ether as its reserve asset, according to a press release on Tuesday. The firm announced it has entered a private investment in public equity (PIPE) agreement for the issuance and sale of 69.1 million of its shares to investors.

Consensys will function as the lead investor for the sales offering, with venture capital firms such as Pantera Capital, ParaFi Capital, Galaxy Digital and Ondo also participating. The sale is expected to generate proceeds of $425 million, which Sharplink intends to use in purchasing Ether as part of its new treasury strategy.

The ETH treasury will take effect upon the closing of the private placement on Thursday, after which Consensys CEO and co-founder of Ethereum Joseph Lubin will join Sharplink's Board of Directors as Chairman.

""On close, Consensys looks forward to partnering with SharpLink to explore and develop an Ethereum Treasury Strategy and to work with them in their core business as a strategic advisor,"" said Lubin in the press release.

Notably, Sharplink is not the first company to adopt an Ethereum treasury plan. Healthcare firm BioNexus Gene Lab (BGLC) announced in March that it would be adding ETH as its treasury asset. Nasdaq-listed blockchain-based firm BTCS also announced it purchased $8.42 million worth of ETH last week, boosting its total holdings to 12,500 ETH.

The development comes as more corporate firms are veering towards a digital asset treasury strategy, particularly for Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL).

These tokens have seen increased institutional exposure in the past few months, with companies like Strategy and DeFi Development Corp consistently purchasing BTC and SOL, thereby boosting their market demand. As a result, both tokens largely outperformed ETH in the past year.

However, ETH's status quo could be set for a boost with Sharplink's $425 million buying pressure.

Additionally, Etherealize, co-founded by Vivek Raman, is working to demonstrate the advantages of the Ethereum ecosystem to traditional finance institutions, ETF issuers and the public. The company prioritizes developing tools that promote the application of Ethereum in financial markets, with a focus on tokenization and secure asset trading.

Ethereum experienced $68.43 million in futures liquidations over the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass data. The total amount of long and short liquidations is $22.53 million and $45.89 million, respectively.

Since recovering the lower boundary of a symmetrical triangle on the weekly chart, ETH has struggled near the resistance range between $2,750 and $2,850, a key level where bears have historically mounted selling pressure.

ETH/USDT weekly chart

If ETH can sustain a high-volume bullish move to flip $2,850 into a support level, it could rally to test the symmetrical triangle's upper boundary. However, it first has to clear the $3,250 resistance to pull off such a move.

On the downside, ETH could find support near the $2,500 level or the lower boundary of the triangle. A decline below this level could bring the support range between $2,250 and $2,100 into focus.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram bars are above their neutral levels, indicating dominant bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) has slightly tilted into its overbought region, signaling rising chances of a short-term pullback.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","How to Research Altcoins Using ChatGPT and Grok: A Step-by-Step Guide","https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-research-altcoins-using-chatgpt-and-grok","Tue, 27 May 2025 13:21:48 GMT","

 ChatGPT and Grok can help you analyze altcoins, compare projects, and stay ahead in crypto research. 

Investments in the fast-paced cryptocurrency market require real-time insights and efficient research. With thousands of projects emerging or disappearing, you need innovative ways to separate signal from noise. 

AI solutions such as ChatGPT and Grok could benefit you as your research assistant, reducing research time and delivering actionable information. 

This article discusses how to use both platforms to make better decisions regarding investment in altcoins.

Both ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 allow you to share content in three ways. 

You can simply paste content in the text box with inverted commas and write your prompt. 

Alternatively, you can upload a document from your local drive or Google Drive on ChatGPT 4o. If you are working with Grok 3, you could upload a file from your local drive or connect a file on Google Drive and Microsoft Drive to the AI platform.

On both ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can paste a link in the text box and write a prompt for the AI engine.

ChatGPT 4o excels at processing and simplifying extensive and often fragmented information. Altcoin projects tend to have extensive white papers and technical documentation. It takes time to get through all the information, analyze it, and draw conclusions. 

With ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can easily get the information you need without spending hours reading the content. You can use the AI platforms for:

Summarizing extensive documentation: You could get a quick summary of vast information that might go into thousands of words, using a prompt like “Summarize this document in plain English with pros, cons and use cases.”

Analyzing tokenomics: You could ask the AI platforms for the altcoin project's breakdown of inflation, token distribution and staking models. For example, you could use a prompt such as “Explain the tokenomics of [Altcoin Name] and its impact on price.” 

Deconstructing roadmaps: Projects often publish unrealistic roadmaps that are hard to implement. AI platforms could quickly analyze the relevancy of roadmaps and suggest to you what you could expect of them. You could use prompts like, “What are the most realistic milestones in this roadmap for 2025?”

Spotting red flags: The goal is not just to understand but to spot red flags, such as overpromising, vague goals or lack of technical updates. 

Did you know? ChatGPT is trained on vast crypto data sets and can explain trends, decode memes, or simplify DeFi tools — even if you are just starting your crypto learning journey.

ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can be valuable tools for quickly comparing different cryptocurrency projects. To begin with, state the names of the cryptocurrencies you want to compare. Also mention the criteria such as use case, consensus process, tokenomics and development activities. 

For example, you can use the prompt, “Create a table comparing Solana and Avalanche in terms of transaction speed, fees and developer adoption.” 

Here is a response from ChatGPT 4o:

And this is Grok 3's response for the same prompt:

AI tools typically use tables or bullet points for an answer. You can also ask additional questions to delve deeper into topics like security, scalability and partnerships. This allows for more efficient evaluation of many projects without the need to search through multiple sources.

To get a market-layer view on ChatGPT 4o, you can use the prompt: 

“Create a table of five layer-1 altcoins with higher throughput than Ethereum and evaluate their adoption metrics.” 

Here is the output of ChatGPT 4o:

Grok 3 gave the following response using the same prompt:

These comparisons help you map out where each altcoin stands relative to its peers and whether it offers a genuine edge.

Did you know? Elon Musk's Grok chatbot was built with a rebellious tone. It excels at quickly pulling crypto insights directly from social chatter, perfect for memecoin hunters.

Developer traction is a dependable indicator of an altcoin's long-term potential. Use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 to find information about overall growth in development activity, surges after certain upgrades, developer count and contributions, commit activity, network upgrades and challenges before developers.

You could use prompts like:

“What has been the developer activity trend on [Project ] over the last 6 months?”

You can also request ecosystem breakdowns with prompts like:

“List top DeFi projects built on Arbitrum with TVL over $10 million.”

ChatGPT 4o generated the following response for this prompt:

Here is Grok 3's response for the same prompt:

ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can synthesize data points from multiple sources and give you a cleaner picture faster than manual web browsing. You could track sudden price spikes with a prompt like:

“In 100 words, write why is $RNDR trending right now?”

Here is ChatGPT 4o's response for this prompt:

This is Grok 3's response for the same prompt:

Grok 3 is particularly useful for monitoring real-time sentiment and news. Grok 3 is ideal for real-time analysis of trends, especially on X, where crypto narratives form quickly. Grok 3 will pull recent posts, mentions and news threads to explain the momentum. It can monitor influencer sentiment.

For deeper and quicker research, you can use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 together.

AI tools like ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 offer powerful support in the altcoin research process, enabling faster analysis, broader comparisons and streamlined access to information. However, even advanced AI models can occasionally misinterpret data or miss contextual nuances. As such, it is essential to treat their responses as a starting point — not a final answer.

When using these tools, take the time to compare outputs, evaluate the sources referenced, and cross-check insights against real-world data. Discrepancies between ChatGPT and Grok responses should prompt further investigation, not automatic preference.

Ultimately, these platforms are most effective when used to enhance critical thinking and research efficiency rather than replace human judgment.

In a fast-moving industry like Web3, effective research requires diligence, curiosity and verification. By applying these principles, you can make more confident and informed investment decisions in the altcoin space.

The latest webcast from the market commentator known as Crypto Insight UK centres on a single contention: the technical and fundamental backdrop for XRP now mirrors the pre-euphoric set-ups that propelled the token from $0.50 to $2.70 in four weeks during 2021, and it could drive a surge “towards eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve dollars in the very short term.”

When Will XRP Hit $12?

The analyst began with Bitcoin, because “Bitcoin price action correlates [with] the rest of the market, at least at the minute, before we start to see dominance breakdown.” Last week's candle, he notes, was the highest weekly close ever recorded by the benchmark asset, yet—critically—the weekly relative-strength index has not entered the overbought zone. In prior cycles, the RSI's passage into that territory “is when we start to get this mania push-up” that drags alt-coins with it. XRP's own history is invoked as corroboration: “When we got the weekly into the overbought, that's when we went from fifty-cent up to $2.70 in the space of like four weeks.”

The analyst then drills into order-book heat-maps. Above Bitcoin price lies what he calls a “dense liquidity” cluster, most prominent around $130,000. A matching reservoir sits below, first at $100,000 and then at $93,000. “If we get a pull-back into this $100K level, I will start to heavily position in leverage in altcoins,” he tells viewers, adding that a deeper flush to $93,000 would see him “continue to add to my positions.”

The market, he argues, is trapped in a self-reinforcing liquidity cycle: each test of overhead supply squeezes shorts, price consolidates, fresh liquidity builds at the new ceiling, and the pattern repeats until a catalyst—a macro loosening of money, a geopolitical shock, or a technical breakout—propels Bitcoin into the next tranche. A sustained move through $130,000, he contends, would likely be that catalyst and would “probably” mark the formal start of alt-season.

XRP's chart is examined through a similar lens. Price has pushed out of what he labels a Wyckoff accumulation range, broken structure to the upside, and is now “finding support on previous resistance” inside a broad bull-flag. On the weekly ratios—XRP/Bitcoin, XRP/Ether and XRP dominance—momentum is quietly inflecting: “We're starting to get bullish divergences, which is where we see higher lows on the RSI and lower lows in price action … it's telling us the sellers are running out of steam.” He identifies a descending trend-line capping the consolidation; once that line breaks, he anticipates “an aggressive move back to the upside for XRP.”

XRP Price Catalysts

The webcast's second movement shifts from charts to narrative catalysts. Here the analyst reels off a series of developments he regards as unusually synchronous. Reece Merrick, Ripple's managing director for the Middle East and Africa, has just unveiled a partnership with the Dubai Land Department that tokenises real-estate title deeds on the XRP Ledger, a choice the press release describes as grounded in the chain's “decade-long reliability.”

Ripple has closed its acquisition of Hidden Road, a prime brokerage whose name appears in DTCC documentation that references both XRP and XLM for cross-chain settlement. The firm, he reminds viewers, also holds “the full crypto payments license and settlement ability in Dubai.”

Speculation that Ripple might purchase Circle—the issuer of USDC—for about $11 billion, though unconfirmed, is folded into the same bullish mosaic, as is the launch of Ripple's own RLUSD stablecoin and talk of a looming XRP spot-ETF.

Brad Garlinghouse himself, the analyst notes, chose ETFs as the single topic for last Thursday's edition of Ripple's “Crypto in a Minute,” having already mused on a podcast that an approval could arrive in July. In Washington, the analyst is watching for passage of the GENIUS stablecoin bill, timing he calls “very convenient” for RLUSD. Even the on-going SEC litigation—Judge Analisa Torres recently rejected the agency's procedural bid to bring the penalty phase to a close—is framed not as a hindrance but as a potential upside catalyst once resolved.

Taken together, he argues, these technical and narrative strands form a spring: “What I'm basically trying to set you up for here, guys, is a succession of positive narratives that will squeeze XRP's price higher as we move into price discovery.”

Yet his crescendo is tempered by disciplined risk management. He illustrates the peril of euphoria with hypothetical road-maps: Bitcoin might gallop to $150,000 or $170,000 and then recoil 18%; altcoins could shed twice that. Under one XRP scenario, an advance to $12 is followed by a 64% retracement to $4.50. “Take some money off the table,” he urges, because unrealised gains “aren't good for anybody.” Profits banked at interim targets equip the trader both to enjoy further upside and to “reallocate if we get a pull-back.”

At press time, XRP traded at $2.30.

A widely followed crypto analyst says that meme asset Dogecoin (DOGE) is facing a crucial turning point while updating his outlook on a handful of other altcoins.

In a new thread, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 138,500 followers on the social media platform X that resistance around the $0.26 level is key for the dog-themed digital asset.

The trader shares a chart suggesting that $0.26 is a price area that appears to be a trend shift level for DOGE.

“This level remains the most important resistance wall for Dogecoin.”

Dogecoin is trading for $0.22 at time of writing, a 3.3% decrease during the last 24 hours.

Moving on to smart contract platform Solana (SOL), Martinez says that a breakout past $186 could trigger an exponential rally that sends the asset shooting past a $3,000 price tag.

“A breakout here could trigger a parabolic bull run for Solana!”

Solana is trading for $172 at time of writing, a 2.6% decrease on the day.

Turning his attention to the payments platform Stellar (XLM), Martinez says that it could witness a correction after moving below a diagonal support.

“XLM could be breaking out of an ascending channel, potentially targeting $0.26!”

XLM is trading for $0.28 at time of writing, a 1.5% decrease on the day.

Concluding his analysis with the native asset of the layer-1 platform Toncoin (TON), the analyst notes that it too looks to be on the cusp of breaking down of a symmetrical triangle pattern.

In technical analysis, a move below the diagonal trendline of a triangle pattern suggests that an asset is primed for corrective moves.

“Watch out! Toncoin could be breaking out of a symmetrical triangle.”

TON is trading for $3.00 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day.

As bitcoin flirts with highs and the crypto market turns green once again, a stark anomaly hits hard: XRP, usually accustomed to the spotlight, records an unexpected collapse in its flows. Far from the excitement electrifying ADA, SOL, or even SUI, Ripple seems to be going its own way… and not in a good way. Let's revisit a reshuffling of the cards that could well redefine the priorities of institutional investors.

The numbers are there, relentless. In one week, XRP sees $37.2 million evaporate in capital. In one month? Nearly $29 million more. For a crypto supposed to compete with giants like BTC and ETH in institutional adoption, it's more than a setback: it's a brutal reconsideration.

Ripple is paying the price for unclear positioning here. Between regulations, intermittent lawsuits with the SEC, and often too vague partnership promises, the crypto seems stuck in inertia that markets no longer tolerate. And even if its annual inflows remain impressive — $226 million since January — the scent of fresh blood attracts sharks elsewhere as shown by the CoinShares report.

The reality is clear: XRP crypto inspires less. Less trust, less movement, and above all, less capital.

On the still-warm ruins of XRP, cryptos like ADA, SUI, SOL, and others are building their rise. Cardano, often mocked for its slow execution, sees its flows steadily climb. +$0.6 million this week, +$1.9 million this month: modest but consistent figures, supported by a loyal crypto community and solid fundamentals.

Solana, on the other hand, shows strong ambitions. With $4.3 million in weekly inflows, it captures the energy of the moment. Less tarnished by regulatory controversies, more agile in its DeFi and NFT deployments, SOL increasingly presents itself as the “People's Ethereum.”

SUI, often in the media shadows, surprises with its performance: $2.9 million this week, $23.9 million since the start of the year. A discreet but powerful surge, proving that investors no longer just follow the headliners.

This rebalancing of flows, much more than a market whim, reveals a profound shift in the crypto ecosystem: diversification has become a strategy, not a luxury.

As often, bitcoin sets the pace. The (brief) crossing of the 110,000 $ mark awakened investors' appetite, boosting the entire crypto market. This simple 3% bounce was enough to repaint charts green, in a bullish ballet where every altcoin seemed to want to play the lead role.

And yet, XRP didn't follow the music. Stuck in its own turbulence, it just watched others take the elevator while it waited for the next one. Although cumulative inflows since January still allow it to remain among the most popular assets, this momentum is fading.

Barring a dramatic turn — a strategic partnership, a decisive legal victory — XRP risks staying sidelined. Not out of play, but far from the center.

In the shifting big game of institutional capital, every move counts. And today, the message is clear: flows are leaving XRP to feed more dynamic, more innovative, sometimes even riskier but above all more vibrant altcoins.

This reshuffling does not signal the death of Ripple, but perhaps marks the end of an era. One where XRP could rest on its historical status. In the post-Bitcoin maximalist era, cryptos must earn their place. And in this race, Ripple no longer has a lead and the death cross revives doubts about its momentum.

 Blockchain.com is opening a Nigerian office as part of its expansion into African markets showing regulatory progress. 

Blockchain.com is stepping up its presence in Africa, targeting markets where governments are beginning to implement crypto regulations.

The UK-based exchange plans to open a physical office during the second quarter in Nigeria — its “fastest-growing market” in West Africa — along with broader expansion efforts in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, according to a May 27 report by Bloomberg.

“Nigeria has taken meaningful steps toward creating a clear framework for crypto,” Owenize Odia, Blockchain.com's general manager for Africa, reportedly said.

The move comes as global sentiment shifts, including political tailwinds from the United States, where President Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance has encouraged industry expansion.

While cryptocurrency trading remains restricted in many African countries, some, including Nigeria and Ghana, are taking steps toward creating legal frameworks for exchanges.

Odia said the company is prioritizing a license application in Nigeria, which recently enacted a new securities law covering digital assets.

Ghana's central bank released draft guidelines indicating plans to begin regulating crypto platforms by September 2025, while Kenya is still in the research phase.

Odia added that such signals of regulatory intent are key to Blockchain.com's expansion decisions. The exchange sees the region's youthful population and currency instability as factors fueling crypto adoption.

Cointelegraph reached out to Blockchain.com for comment but did not receive a response by publication.

Blockchain.com claims 37 million verified users, 92 million wallets and over $1 trillion in transaction volume, according to its website.

In 2022, Blockchain.com closed a funding round that saw its valuation spike from $5.2 billion to $14 billion less than two months before the collapse of Do Kwon's Terra ecosystem.

However, a $110 million Series E financing round in 2023 more than halved its 2022 valuation

South Africa is emerging as a frontrunner in Africa's crypto race, with the country positioning itself as a regional hub for digital assets.

According to Ben Caselin, chief marketing officer at Johannesburg-based crypto exchange VALR, South Africa's strong legal infrastructure and business-friendly environment make it an ideal launchpad for crypto companies looking to expand across the continent.

In a September 2024 interview with Cointelegraph, Caselin emphasized that regulatory clarity is a major factor drawing both local and international players to South Africa.

Momentum continues to build, with the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) approving 59 crypto platform licenses by March 2024, as over 260 applications remain under review.

The Blockchain Group (ALTBG), a Paris-listed firm focused on data intelligence and decentralized technologies, has issued a 63.3 million euro ($71.9 million) in convertible bonds to further its bitcoin BTC$110,024.93 treasury strategy. 

This financing, executed through its Luxembourg subsidiary, highlights a significant push towards expanding the company's BTC reserves and reinforcing its investor base.

A key component of the deal includes a $5.7 million BTC-denominated bond subscribed by Moonlight Capital, issued at a 30% premium over the May 23 closing price ($4.3/share).

The company also finalized the exercise of all rights for Convertible Bonds B-02 (""OCA Tranche 2"") initially reserved for strategic investors Fulgur Ventures and UTXO Management at $0.79/share, totaling $66 million.

Notably, investor Adam Back has converted all his OCA Tranche 1 bonds into 14.88 million shares, reinforcing long-term alignment with the company's vision. These capital inflows are expected to fund the acquisition of 590 BTC, potentially increasing The Blockchain Group's holdings to approximately 1,437 BTC.

New York, NY, May 27th, 2025, Chainwire

Sonic SVM, the first SVM chain extension on Solana, today announced its expanding ecosystem of native projects spanning multiple verticals. Following its successful mainnet launch and Mobius Hackathon, where they received over 250 unique project submissions – Sonic has attracted a diverse set of innovative protocols leveraging its high-performance infrastructure to build next-generation Web3 applications.

“The rapid development of our ecosystem demonstrates the versatility and performance advantages of Sonic SVM,” said Chris Zhu, CEO and co-founder at Sonic. “These projects represent the beginning of a vibrant, interconnected ecosystem that's building critical infrastructure across DeFi, NFTs, and social applications.”

SEGA has emerged as the leading DEX on Sonic SVM, pioneering the ve(3,3) model and redefining attention capital markets through its innovative launchpad. With over $1.18 million in TVL and $9 million in cumulative trading volume, SEGA has quickly established itself as the backbone of Sonic's DeFi ecosystem.

Key metrics:

“SEGA is built to capitalize on Sonic's superior performance, allowing us to create trading experiences that weren't possible on other chains,” said a SEGA representative. “Our ve(3,3) model creates stronger alignment between liquidity providers and token holders, while our launchpad is designed specifically for the attention economy.”

Chaos Finance has launched the first liquid staking protocol designed specifically for Sonic SVM, enabling users to participate in network security while maintaining liquidity. Built on StaFi LSaaS technology, Chaos offers seamless staking with deep DeFi integrations.

Now, there are over 765k+ SONIC staked through chaos, and 754k+ sSONIC circulating in the market. FoMoney, the fully onchain game has teamed up with Chaos, and integrated sSONIC as an in-game currency.

“Liquid staking is critical infrastructure for any blockchain ecosystem,” noted a Chaos Finance representative. “Our protocol allows users to simultaneously secure the network and participate in DeFi opportunities, maximizing capital efficiency while supporting Sonic's decentralization.”

Originally launched as Sonic SVM's first meme token launchpad, Goodr is evolving into the world's first UGC IP token platform for anime fans. The platform will enable fans to mint tokens inspired by official anime content through partnerships with Japanese IP holders.

“Goodr transforms attention into on-chain activity and liquidity,” explained a Goodr representative. “We're not just launching meme tokens – we're building a bridge between anime fandom and Web3, starting with our beta release on May 20th.”

Goodr will also release the SonicSVM Meme Kit (SDK), enabling builders to easily launch meme tokens within the ecosystem. Additionally, a strategic partnership between SEGA and Goodr will strengthen user acquisition and retention across the ecosystem.

Chillonic has launched the first NFT collection on Sonic SVM, featuring the groundbreaking Chill-404 Protocol that bridges the gap between NFTs and memecoins. This innovative technology allows users to seamlessly convert between NFTs and fungible tokens, solving liquidity challenges while preserving digital collectibles' unique identity and rarity.

“Our protocol represents a paradigm shift in how digital assets function,” said a Chillonic representative. “By allowing seamless conversion between NFTs and tokens, we're creating a new asset class that combines the best of both worlds.”

FoMoney: The First Fully-onchain game on Sonic SVM

FoMoney is a fully on-chain game on Sonic SVM that merges the 2048 game with Fomo3D. It aims to build a Game Asset Layer, enabling holders of SONIC 's LST(sSONIC) to generate yields while also engaging in immersive gameplays.

Since launching on Sonic testnet, FoMoney have onboarded 1 million+ on-chain players and created 200+ millions transactions. FoMoney envisions the creation of an On-chain Playground capable of generating economic value for Sonic's Attention Capital Market.

These flagship projects form the foundation of a rapidly expanding ecosystem on Sonic SVM. With complementary functionalities spanning trading, staking, meme culture, and digital collectibles, they demonstrate the versatility of Sonic's infrastructure for supporting diverse Web3 applications.

“What's particularly exciting is how these projects are already beginning to integrate with each other,” added Freiheit, Head of DeFi from Sonic. “The partnership between SEGA and Chillonic, Chaos and FoMoney are just the first examples of the network effects we're seeing within our ecosystem.”

Sonic SVM is the first chain extension SVM to launch on Solana – developing a groundbreaking blockchain protocol that serves as a programmable attention settlement layer. Built on the HSSN network, it offers consensus-level validation of attention-related transactions, granular on-chain access to user activity across dApps, and composable primitives that eliminate the need for each project to build bespoke attention infrastructure.

This paper reviews two important design choices for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). First, how CBDC intermediaries should be compensated for their services. Second, how payments from traditional banks into CBDC wallets should be cleared. Both of these design choices have important implications for the financial stability of the banking system.

 Why are central banks looking at blockchains? 

Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.

The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. 

Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.

From a central bank's vantage point, two questions matter:

These questions motivate pilots such as Project Pine, Project Guardian in Singapore, the Bank of England's wholesale CBDC sandbox and Japan's multiyear retail CBDC pilot.

 What is “tokenized” monetary policy? 

Tokenized monetary policy means that the liabilities and assets a central bank uses to steer short-term interest rates exist as programmable tokens on a distributed-ledger platform. 

In such a token arrangement, what the BIS describes as an ecosystem where money and securities share a common ledger, monetary functions are executed by smart contracts, replacing the traditional batch file processes used in overnight real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems.

In practice, each policy tool is expressed as code:

Project Pine demonstrated all three, using ERC-20 tokens for reserves and securities on a permissioned Ethereum-compatible chain.

But how is tokenized monetary policy different from traditional monetary policy?

Traditional policy operations rely on central bank systems such as Fedwire or the Bank of England's RTGS. These systems close overnight, settle in discrete batches and require multiple human sign-offs. 

A tokenized system settles atomically in seconds, keeps an immutable audit trail and lets policy adjustments propagate without waiting for dealers to book trades. The BIS paper on tokenisation notes that combining assets and settlement on a single ledger can shrink operational risk and latency.



Did you know? A repo is a short-term secured loan in which one party sells securities and agrees to repurchase them later at a higher price. In contrast, a reverse repo is the same transaction viewed from the counterparty's perspective (buying the securities and later reselling them).

 What is Project Pine? 

Project Pine is a research initiative led by the BIS Innovation Hub and the New York Fed that explores how central banks could run monetary policy in a future where money and government securities are digital tokens managed on blockchain-like systems.

Launched in late 2024 and published in May 2025, the project built a working prototype, a “starter kit” for central banks, designed to test whether tools like interest on reserves, repo operations and asset purchases can be run using smart contracts.

The project ran simulated financial scenarios, mimicking both calm and crisis conditions:



These scenarios were run in a test environment with simulated commercial banks and a programmable blockchain platform. Everything from interest payments to collateral valuation was automated, providing a glimpse into how monetary policy might function in a 24/7, tokenized financial system.

This was not an isolated experiment. Other central banks are running parallel pilots that explore similar ground with their distinct approaches:

Taken together, these pilots confirm that key features like programmability, real-time visibility, and atomic settlement are no longer theoretical — they work. They don't yet answer the more challenging question: How do central banks transition an entire financial system to such rails without disrupting credit creation and intermediation?

Did you know? Project Pine's digital monetary system is built like a three-layer cake: The bottom layer is a programmable blockchain (Besu), the middle is packed with tokenized money and assets (like ERC-20 reserves) and the top layer runs the smart contracts that carry out monetary policy actions.

 Why is Project Pine important? 

Project Pine is the first of its kind to show that core central bank tools could be rebuilt using smart contracts. 

It proves that:

Who was involved in Project Pine experiments?

Seven major central banks, including those of Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, Switzerland, the EU and the US, collaborated on shaping the toolkit and defining test requirements. The findings don't commit any of these banks to adopt such systems, but they provide a solid foundation for future research and policymaking.

What did Project Pine test?

To see how well the system works, Project Pine ran tests based on real-world situations, such as raising interest rates or a government debt crisis. They tried short and long periods, small and large financial systems, tight and loose money conditions and different ways of lending (like bank loans or corporate bonds). This helped check if the system could handle all kinds of economic ups and downs.

Did you know? In Project Pine, central bank operations like paying interest on reserves or managing collateral aren't done manually; they're handled by smart contracts coded directly into the top “protocol layer” of the blockchain stack.

 Practical design challenges in tokenized monetary policy 

As central banks explore moving policy tools onto blockchains, they face several significant design hurdles. These aren't just technical. They're legal, operational and even philosophical. 

Here are the key ones:

These challenges aren't deal-breakers, but they do show that making money programmable isn't as simple as flipping a switch. Central banks must work closely with lawmakers, cybersecurity experts and the financial industry to ensure tokenized monetary systems are safe, fair and reliable.

 The road ahead 

The future of tokenized monetary policy will likely unfold in carefully staged phases, balancing innovation with financial stability.

The BIS Innovation Hub lists more than a dozen ongoing tokenization projects from Australia's Project Dunbar (multi-CBDC bridge) to Switzerland's Project Helvetia (DLT-based repo). Commercial banks, meanwhile, are shifting rails: HSBC settled its first tokenized-deposit payment in April 2025, and Euroclear is piloting blockchain settlement for tokenized bonds.

Central banks face a coordination game: Go slow and risk private standards hardening around them; go too fast and upend the funding model of commercial banks. 

The likeliest path is a phased approach:

Just as earlier shifts like the rollout of RTGS systems or inflation-targeting regimes were introduced gradually to test and refine their impact, tokenized systems will be phased in through pilots, sandboxes and hybrid models before full-scale adoption.

Whether it ultimately reshapes how central banks manage the economy remains to be seen.

Sati, a Bitcoin payments app and Lightning infrastructure provider, today announced the launch of its Lightning integration with Xverse, a Bitcoin wallet used by over 1.5 million people worldwide. Thanks to the integration, Xverse users can now send and receive sats (Bitcoin's smallest denomination) instantly over the Lightning Network with no setup, no app switching, and no custodial risk.

Initially designed in 2017, the Lightning Network has grown to become Bitcoin's leading layer-2, with a current BTC capacity of over $465M. Sati is now leveraging this technology to bring the world's favorite digital currency into the pockets of almost 3 billion users worldwide, thanks to its powerful API integration with WhatsApp.

“Bitcoin was not meant to be an asset for Wall Street—it was built for peer-to-peer money, borderless and accessible,” said Felipe Servin, Founder and CEO of Sati. “Integrating Lightning natively into Xverse brings that vision back to life, making Bitcoin usable at scale for billions.”

Thanks to the integration, every Xverse user now gets a Lightning Address instantly. That means they can receive tips, pay invoices, and use Bitcoin for microtransactions—all without having to manage channels or switch between different apps. Sati expects USDT on Lightning to be supported as early as Q3 for the Xverse wallet and in July 2025for users accessing Sati through WhatsApp.

This integration positions Sati's role as a Lightning infrastructure provider, not just a consumer app. By leveraging its API-based solution, the company provides plug-and-play backend services to wallets and platforms looking to add Bitcoin payments without compromising on security or UX.

The Xverse launch follows the debut of Parasite Pool, a new mining pool leveraging Sati and Xverse's tech stack and focused on democratizing Bitcoin mining. Parasite Pool charges 0% fees and pays out instantly over Lightning, making it ideal for small-scale miners, especially those running ultra-low-power hardware like Bitaxe.

With over 500 users joining Parasite Pool within weeks of launch and an average pool hashrate of 5 PH/s, Parasite Pool is steadily growing its presence in the home mining space. Thanks to the Lightning integration, Parasite Pool supports the smallest Lightning payouts in the industry (a fraction of a cent), lowering the barrier to entry for anyone interested in mining.

Sati recently closed a $600K pre-seed round backed by Bitcoin-focused investors, including Draper Associates, BitcoinFi, Arcanum, BoostVC, and Ricardo Salinas. The funding is being used to support global expansion, stablecoin integration, Lightning infrastructure growth, and broader access to Bitcoin in emerging markets.

Sati will be conducting live product demos at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on May 27-29. To learn more about Sati, visit sati.pro

              Highlights            



                        Circle, the issuer of USDC, has filed for an IPO with hopes of a $5.65 billion valuation, aiming to boost institutional trust through transparency and U.S. regulatory compliance.                      


                        Circle earned $1.68 billion in 2024, with 99% from interest on USDC reserves, and a potential 1% drop in interest rates could reduce its income by $441 million.                      


                        To evolve beyond a stablecoin issuer, Circle launched the Circle Payments Network (CPN) to support cross-border payments and diversify its business as it navigates regulatory uncertainty.                      

Each week, the evolution of the ongoing cryptocurrency-FinTech convergence seems to get another headline to hang its hat on.

Last week, it was the news Thursday (May 22) that J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup are exploring the launch of a jointly operated stablecoin.

This week, it is the news Tuesday (May 27) that Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CRCL.” Circle is hoping for a valuation of $5.65 billion with an offering price target of $24 to $26 per share. The lead underwriters are J.P. Morgan, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.

Circle is betting that the credibility conferred by becoming a public company will help the company in a financial environment skeptical of opaque crypto firms. Transparency is a key pillar of Circle's pitch to institutional clients as outlined in its S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. By going public, Circle will subject itself to the scrutiny of U.S. securities laws, quarterly earnings reports and regulatory disclosures, all elements designed to engender trust from risk-averse enterprises, banks and governments.

Circle's goal for its IPO is to position itself favorably to become the financial utility layer of the internet. Think Amazon Web Services (AWS) for money movement or a SWIFT network reimagined for digital assets.

To get there, Circle may need to evolve beyond being a stablecoin issuer. Elements such as programmable money services, secure identity layers, robust compliance automation and user-friendly APIs could be crucial since institutional trust is hard-won and easily lost.

The stablecoin arena is no longer the wild frontier it once was. Circle must now contend with legacy finance and FinTech upstarts. PayPal launched PYUSD, and traditional banking consortia are mulling their own. Tether remains the volume leader globally, especially outside the United States.

Circle's edge lies in its U.S.-compliant stance and focus on transparency and fiat backing. But whether that will be enough to ward off better capitalized or more broadly distributed competitors is uncertain. The potential IPO valuation and capital war chest may help, but only if Circle is able to move quickly to entrench itself as the preferred partner for enterprises.

Circle's S-1 offers insight into its revenue model, revealing an interest-sensitive business. In 2024, the company earned $1.68 billion in total revenue, with 99% of that coming from interest income on reserves backing USDC. That figure underscores how tightly Circle's fortunes could be tied to interest rate policy.

As a practical matter, Circle earns this income by parking USDC reserves in short-term U.S. Treasury securities and overnight reverse repurchase agreements. The downside is that if interest rates fall, so too does Circle's revenue. According to its filing, a 1% drop in rates could slash income by as much as $441 million.

Stablecoins have started to decouple themselves from crypto exchanges and position themselves as a component of real-world financial infrastructure, PYMNTS reported in March. Additionally, stablecoin market capitalization reached an all-time high amid strong performance across crypto sectors in April.

Circle's IPO plans can also be seen as a part of a broader movement among other major crypto firms seeking to capitalize on a more pro-crypto, pro-business regulatory climate under the President Donald Trump administration.

The SEC, for example, said it is eying regulatory changes to accommodate on-chain securities and other crypto assets. Meanwhile, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 (GENIUS) Act, the country's first stablecoin legislation, is proceeding through the Senate amid recognition in Washington that stablecoins are too big to ignore.

Still, the GENIUS Act could include a provision prohibiting interest-bearing stablecoins. The Circle S-1 flags multiple legal risks, but chief among them is the uncertain U.S. regulatory environment for stablecoins.

To diversify its business model, Circle this month brought the Circle Payments Network (CPN) live. Designed to facilitate the use of stablecoins for mainstream cross-border payments, the network and coordination protocol enables financial institutions to exchange payment instructions and settle transactions on open, public blockchains.

Early adopters of CPN include Alfred Pay, which is using the network to enable stablecoin-to-fiat offramps via PIX and SPEI; Tazapay, which is using it to support compliant fiat disbursements into Hong Kong; RedotPay, which is using the network to initiate USDC-based payments into Brazil; and Conduit, which is using it to onramp fiat into USDC in the U.S. and Europe to support B2B flows into Mexico.

The Trump administration is removing every financial guardrail from crypto, in order to enrich the first family and its tech and finance allies while destabilizing the economy.

This article appears in the June 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here.

When Javier Selgas, the CEO of Freight Technologies, Inc., or Fr8Tech, a publicly traded trucking logistics firm, was thinking about how he might influence policy in President Donald Trump's second administration, he landed on a novel mechanism: buying $20 million worth of $TRUMP tokens, the cryptocurrency meme coin (colloquially known as a “shitcoin”) Trump had released the day before inauguration weekend.

“We believe that the addition of the Official Trump tokens are an excellent way to diversify our crypto treasury, and also an effective way to advocate for fair, balanced, and free trade between Mexico and the US,” said Selgas in a press release. The company also disclosed the purchase in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, noting that it took out $20 million in debt to buy the tokens, whose value can fluctuate wildly. (In a stricter economic sense, meme coins like $TRUMP are considered to have no inherent value, their price propped up by hype, the hopeful delusions of speculators, and market manipulation. So in that sense, Fr8Tech was borrowing $20 million for the financial equivalent of air.)

But the motives of using corporate treasuries and borrowing capacity for a shitcoin were perfectly clear. Twenty million dollars may be enough to vault Selgas to the top of the leaderboard of owners of $TRUMP, which would land him an audience with the president, who recently announced that the top 220 on the leaderboard would be invited to a presidential dinner.

Even some Democrats have begun calling it for what it is: the biggest financial scandal to ever hit the presidency.

If the president, with the backing of the Supreme Court, hadn't claimed broad immunity for himself, the $TRUMP dinner might be considered an unparalleled form of potentially illegal influence peddling. Instead, it's another lucrative way the president has found to monetize his office. And even if it were still illegal—which it may well be—the president's team of regulators and law enforcers are highly unlikely to see it that way.

With a pro-crypto regulatory regime being constructed and the old financial guardrails mostly dismantled, everyone has adjusted to the new reality. Corporations and even some unions have started adding crypto tokens to their balance sheets, with ostensibly sober-minded CFOs treating it as a reasonable financial diversification strategy. The pacesetter for this trend is MicroStrategy, once a reasonably successful enterprise software company that now owns about 1 in every 40 Bitcoins in existence, whose CEO has become a Bitcoin celebrity, constantly hosting events for executives to learn about adding Bitcoin to their company portfolios. (Selling to one's peers is a core strategy of any multilevel marketing scheme, which Bitcoin in some ways resembles.)

These are the increasingly hallucinatory economics of crypto-laden corporate balance sheets, which ring out with risk and contradictions. But buying tokens from the president of the United States is another innovation entirely, a form of corruption so obvious that even some frontline Democrats have begun calling it for what it is: the biggest financial scandal to ever hit the presidency.

What Freight Technologies did was perhaps a sensible act of self-interest. Since Trump introduced his meme coin, many observers (including me) have warned that it is an unprecedented vehicle for personal enrichment and potentially for bribery. It doesn't even require Trump's explicit agreement. The immediate effect of buying $20 million in crypto tokens issued by the president is to boost their value, directly boosting the fortunes of Team Trump, since Trump-connected wallets control 80 percent of the $TRUMP token supply. A CEO or leader of an autocratic state can simply buy up millions in $TRUMP tokens from an exchange and then alert someone on Trump's side, or even just announce publicly with the expectation that someone in Trump's orbit will hear it, that they've put money in his pocket.

Trump and his investors could even pump the token together. If I tell Trump's crypto company that I intend to buy $50 million of $TRUMP, they could take advantage of the brief rise in token price that's sure to follow. Indeed, this is the intention anytime Trump posts on social media about his token, and it was the intention anytime Elon Musk posted about DOGE (back when it was just a meme coin, rather than a vehicle for an administrative coup). It's a standard part of the pump-and-dump mechanics underlying all meme coins, being done here on a larger, Trumpian scale.

A beneficiary of at least three separate crypto businesses, Trump has an uncanny knack for remembering everything that anyone has ever done for him or to him, with an eye toward meting out reward or punishment in exchange. The $TRUMP token, and crypto in general, has become the perfect medium for that exchange. And the casual brazenness by which powerful people are playing this game has become the defining characteristic of the second Trump term.

THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION has dismantled crypto crime task forces at the SEC, Department of Justice, and across the government. The administration moved quickly to end numerous regulatory investigations of crypto companies and tycoons, including top campaign donors like Coinbase and Ripple. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche issued crypto-related legal guidance calling for an end to “regulation by prosecution,” echoing language used by the crypto industry when it complained about the Biden administration's “regulation by enforcement.” The Blanche memo also seemed designed to end two prominent criminal prosecutions into developers of “crypto mixers” that obfuscate the trail of crypto, facilitating billions of dollars in money laundering by North Korean hackers and other criminals.

The White House has said that it will not enforce the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the law that bans bribery of foreign officials. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Federal Reserve revoked several pieces of guidance on banks' crypto activities, breaking down the firewall between the crypto sector and the banking sector, precisely what protected the broader economy during the series of crypto meltdowns in 2022, culminating in Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX collapse. Now, the crypto industry is likely to have access to all the mainstream financing it wants—with the attendant potential for contagion to spread to mainstream markets when crypto crashes again.

Taken together, these measures open the door for almost limitless corruption, just as President Trump's crypto ventures prepare to take in billions of dollars from foreign investors.

Trump-related cryptocurrency and, at right, NFTs: digital trading cards released by the president

After receiving more than $200 million in support from the crypto industry in the 2024 election cycle, Trump isn't just clearing the regulatory runway for industry takeoff. Trump and his family have jumped into the deep end of the crypto business, becoming one of the country's leading purveyors of meme coins, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other digital tchotchkes while partnering with some of the industry's sketchiest players. Even Trump's cult-of-personality Truth Social microblogging website is gearing up to release something called Truth.Fi, a fintech investment platform that is partnering with Crypto.com, an exchange that just so happened to have a pending SEC investigation dropped just three days after the announcement of the partnership.

As the writer Molly White has chronicled, the Trump family's crypto interests extend from tokens to Bitcoin mining to lending products and even a crypto game in the mold of Monopoly. The normally staid Wall Street Journal aptly summarized the harrowing state of play: “The crypto tycoons that previous administrations pursued for helping the U.S. government's foes move their funds—Russian sanctions evaders, Islamic terrorist groups, Mexican drug cartels, global fraud rings—are now doing business with the president and members of his inner circle.”

These ventures are divided between a number of companies, including some semi-obscure LLCs: Trump Media, World Liberty Financial, CIC Digital, Fight Fight Fight LLC, DT Marks DEFI LLC, and so on. While The New York Times and other prominent outlets have begun devoting more resources to chronicling Trump's crypto operation, there is no comprehensive account of how many companies he has, where they're located, who the investors are, what deals he's making, or who's purchasing his tokens. No blockchain analytics firm—which tend to cater to a conflicted mix of corporate, government, and gray-market clients—has issued a substantive report on the full scope of Trump's crypto dealings. It should have been an automatic investigation for Congress and for multiple inspectors general, but Democrats have wallowed in their minority status while Trump illegally fired 18 IGs during his first week in office.

While Trump builds out this lucrative operation, he and his crypto and tech industry advisers have been sweeping aside consumer protection regulations and legal barriers that limited crypto's access to mainstream banking. “This [crypto] empire is set to profit precisely because Trump is gutting the regulations that would normally constrain it—brazen self-dealing that dwarfs even the unchecked emoluments violations of his first term,” wrote White.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, for instance, has more than 8,000 registered consumer complaints about Coinbase, America's leading crypto exchange and a popular market for speculators to gamble on the $TRUMP token. In February, when Elon Musk and DOGE began gutting the CFPB, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong celebrated on X, writing: “The CFPB is unconstitutional on the face of it. And even if it wasn't, it should be deleted as we already have DOJ to prosecute fraud, and (many) other financial services regulators. It's an activist organization that has done enormous harm to the country.”

As the CFPB and other institutions designed to contain finance's worst excesses and prosecute fraudsters are battered into submission, there is nothing stopping Trump from merging his personal business with foreign policy. For example, according to some reports, Trump is already pushing his tokens on foreign governments via Steve Witkoff, the president's diplomatic envoy to the Middle East. Witkoff and his son Zach are co-founders of World Liberty Financial, a platform that Trump has a controlling 60 percent stake in and the title of chief crypto advocate. World Liberty Financial offers a digital token called $WLFI; the elder Witkoff has publicly promoted the venture, and apparently he is doing the same in private. “Steve Witkoff is calling every sovereign government and saying, ‘You need to support this coin if you want to be in good standing with Trump,'” a venture capitalist who advises the Trump administration told Business Insider.

We have already seen the kind of quid pro quo that can result from a prominent person doing business with Trump's crypto companies. After Trump was elected in November 2024, Chinese businessman Justin Sun bought $75 million worth of $WLFI tokens from World Liberty Financial. After Sun made his purchases, the company publicly celebrated his involvement as an investor, and the SEC froze its fraud investigation into Sun.

In all, World Liberty Financial has sold at least $550 million worth of its tokens, which can't yet be traded or moved off its platform. According to WLF's website, the Trump family receives 75 percent of all proceeds from token sales, after certain expenses are covered.

Trump has created a permission structure for crypto businesses to push whatever limits might remain.

After the SEC quashed its fraud investigation into Sun, The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg soon reported that Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, the co-founder of Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, who spent four months in federal prison for his company's money-laundering violations, wanted to strike a similar agreement as Sun did. Steve Witkoff led some of the negotiations between the two sides, according to the Journal. The alleged pardon was reportedly going to be accompanied by a Trump investment in Binance's U.S. operations, which had also been subject to regulatory investigation. Just a year earlier, Binance had agreed to pay a $4.3 billion fine for allowing money laundering on its platform, the largest corporate fine in U.S. history.

Zhao denied the substance of the reports but later said that he did in fact request a pardon. “I was like, well, if they're writing this article, I might as well just officially apply, right?” Zhao told an interviewer. (After going to prison, Zhao stepped down as CEO while retaining his ownership share. Since his release and return to his home in Dubai, he has appeared to still be involved with Binance in a major capacity, representing it at public events.)

Trump and Binance show every sign of diving into business together. As Congress works toward codifying stablecoins into law—and giving non-bank corporations and Big Tech firms the ability to issue their own digital currencies—Donald Trump has already gone ahead and created his own as part of a project that involves Binance. Called USD1, the token is issued by World Liberty Financial, and like all stablecoins, it's supposed to remain at a constant value, pegged to the U.S. dollar. (Stablecoins sometimes lose their peg, which is when calamity can strike.)

USD1 is a digital dollar—a counterfeit dollar, perhaps, depending on one's legal interpretation. Certainly, the identification of an essentially fictitious dollar-like digital currency with the U.S. president must be good for business. According to a State Democracy Defenders Fund report, “By designating its stablecoin ‘USD1,' WLFI has largely appropriated the internationally recognized code used for trading U.S. dollars in the foreign currency market—that is ‘USD'. As a result, the USD1 designation may lead potential investors to mistakenly believe they are purchasing a digital asset that is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.”

USD1 is already off to a running start. MGX, an Abu Dhabi investment fund, is purchasing $2 billion worth of USD1 tokens to use for an investment in Binance, whose unofficial headquarters is in the United Arab Emirates. The deal was announced by Zach Witkoff at the TOKEN2049 conference in Dubai, where Eric Trump appeared alongside Justin Sun.

“It's one of the more successful things we've ever done,” Eric Trump told The New York Times, speaking about World Liberty Financial.

IN BOTH A LEGAL SENSE and by his own example, Trump has created a permission structure for crypto businesses to push whatever limits might remain. Crypto partisans oversee the SEC and the Justice Department. Paul Atkins, the new SEC chair, was the CEO of a consulting firm with several crypto clients whose first public appearance as chair was at a crypto roundtable where he vowed to throw out rules on digital assets imposed by his predecessor, even without congressional guidance. The attorney general is Pam Bondi; her brother Brad has advised multiple DeFi and other crypto projects for years, according to published reports. Even if one does run afoul of the law, there are options. Trevor Milton, former CEO of an electric truck company, was convicted of securities fraud and sentenced to four years in prison in 2022. (He was represented by Marc Mukasey, who had previously represented the Trump Organization.) After Milton and his wife made $1.8 million in pro-Trump political donations, he was pardoned by the president in March.

Those who don't need pardons know well that enforcement of the vast array of exploitation facilitated by crypto seems likely to plummet. The prominent crypto figure and Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, who almost certainly would not have attempted to enter the United States under the previous administration given the federal criminal investigation reportedly trailing him, has appeared with politicians in D.C., on conference panels, and at the New York Stock Exchange, despite his company being banned from doing business in New York state, a condition of an $18.5 million settlement that Tether reached in 2021 with state Attorney General Letitia James related to the cover-up of $850 million in missing company funds. (Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was Tether's primary U.S. banker and business partner when he was CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald. The portfolio at Cantor Fitzgerald has since been passed to Lutnick's son.)

Above all, Trump's crypto policies—which unite self-dealing and political favoritism toward a single industry to a unique degree—represent a scam upon the American people. Trump's legal and regulatory moves will result in fewer prosecutions of financial criminals, fewer fines paid, and less attention from authorities on the plague of financial scams that rob Americans of billions of dollars per year, like pig butchering, the text-based scheme that lures in unsuspecting people to make worthless crypto investments. Fewer shitcoin dealers will be investigated for issuing unlicensed securities or defrauding customers, because the president is the country's leading shitcoiner. Fewer stablecoins will be questioned about the assets backing their offerings, because the president has a stablecoin. Fewer crypto game magnates will face regulatory scrutiny for their exploitative, pyramid-scheme-like business models, because the president has a crypto game. And nobody will raise a peep about whether crypto tokens are unregistered securities, as long as the president is peddling unregistered securities.

Eric Trump has called his family's crypto business “one of the more successful things we've ever done.”

By pardoning and commuting the sentences of crypto executives and convicted fraudsters like Ozy Media CEO Carlos Watson, Trump has signaled to major financial criminals that they have carte blanche, as long as they plan to pay up later. Lawyers and Trump-connected operatives are offering pardon consulting services for a minimum buy-in of $1 million, according to Bloomberg.

There are huge material costs to pardoning fraudsters and financial malefactors, in terms of individual losses, harm to legitimate businesses, and lost fines and restitution that were supposed to go to victims and the state. “In total, Donald Trump has granted pardons that have wiped out over $1 billion in debts owed by wealthy Americans who have committed fraud and broken the law,” said Liz Oyer, a former pardon attorney at the Department of Justice. It also serves to undermine any remaining faith the public might have that the government can hold white-collar criminals to account.

Fraud is a social crime, where people leverage the trust of those around them, and its growth erodes the social fabric. Trump-related companies' meme coin pump-and-dump has already leveraged his supporters' belief in him to scam them out of hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. According to a recent analysis published by CNBC, “about 764,000 [crypto] wallets that purchased President Donald Trump's $TRUMP meme coin have lost money on the investment.” At the same time, 58 wallets made a combined $1.1 billion in profit, likely because they were controlled by insiders. The tokens generated at least $324 million in trading fees, some chunk of which went to the Trump family.

“THE RISK OF POLITICIAN COINS comes from the fact that they are such a perfect bribery vehicle,” wrote Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of the Ethereum cryptocurrency, less than a week after the introduction of $TRUMP. “If a politician issues a coin, you do not even need to send *them* any coins to give them money. Instead, you just buy and hold the coin, and this increases the value of their holdings passively.”

Buterin added that there was “deniability” in this scheme—a person could claim they were buying the coin to gamble, not to enrich the politician behind it. “You can even hold the coin privately, and show that you are holding it to whoever you need to show.”

“This all very risky to democracy,” wrote Buterin. “I recommend politicians do not go down this path.”

They haven't listened. Donald Trump may be the chief political purveyor of cryptocurrencies, but he's being closely watched by his Republican allies, Argentina President Javier Milei, Central African Republic President Faustin-Archange Touadéra, and a host of other global politicians wondering how they might emulate his example.

Democratic opposition to Trump's crypto ventures has been scattered and exceedingly late in coming. Speaking at a town hall about Trump's dinner invite for token-holders, Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) said, “There is no doubt that this president's conduct has already exceeded any prior standard for impeachment.” Earlier this year, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) and Rep. Sam Liccardo (D-CA) introduced the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (or MEME) Act, which bans the president and members of Congress from selling their own crypto tokens. (A separate but similar bill called the End Crypto Corruption Act was introduced around the same time.)

“It's essentially a way for any corporate CEO, any Saudi prince, any foreign oligarch who has business before the Trump administration, to send Trump money privately, secretly, and then whisper to the Trump administration about how much money they've sent and the favor that they need,” said Murphy in an announcement.

Sen. Murphy is correct, but the phenomenon he worries about is already happening. And if the MEME Act or the End Crypto Corruption Act passes, who would enforce it? Several Democrats are apparently content to collaborate in blessing this interlocking set of grifts, while pretending to take them on. But even if they stood strong in opposition, as long as Trump is president, the crypto industry will still likely get the market access and personalized rulemaking it desires.

With the president signing an executive order establishing a “strategic digital asset reserve,” the federal government is now exploring ways to acquire and hold more Bitcoin—an interesting thing to do in the same month that Trump's sons announced an investment in a Bitcoin mining company. A similar effort seeks to put together a reserve of select tokens under the management of crypto and AI czar David Sacks, who has crypto industry investments through his VC firm Craft Ventures. One of the tokens included would be Solana, which has investments from Trumpworld figures like Marc Andreessen's a16z and whose blockchain powers the $TRUMP and $MELANIA shitcoins. With a strategic crypto reserve, the financial interests of the president, his family, a powerful group of donors, and a new profit-seeking arm of the federal government manage to converge, a turducken of corruption.

We've never seen anything like it, but it was also entirely foreseeable—the natural outcome for an industry whose survival has depended on aggressive regulatory arbitrage and political influence campaigns. The problem for the American people is that “the crypto president,” as Trump now calls himself, is overwhelmingly incentivized to continue pumping a substance-free digital-asset bubble that will inevitably pop. Until that happens, the crypto industry will get more access to mainstream banking and financing, creating more crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other risky financial products that in turn will be bought up by retirement funds, unions, and institutional investors. And when it all blows up, we will struggle to explain to our friends and family how shitcoin-based ETFs became the credit default swaps of the latest elite-driven financial crisis.

 Shares in Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) tumbled Tuesday as the company behind President Donald Trump's Truth Social app said it is planning to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin.


 Trump Media stock is down 8% in intraday trading Tuesday and has lost almost a quarter of its value so far this year entering Tuesday.


 Trump Media said it would sell around $1.5 billion in shares and $1 billion in zero-coupon convertible bonds to approximately 50 institutional investors in a private placement.


 “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets,"" Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said. The $2.5 billion offering is expected to close on Thursday, the company said, and will ""place Bitcoin on Trump Media's balance sheet alongside existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaling $759.0 million as of the end of the first quarter of 2025.""


 The Financial Times earlier Tuesday reported the plan by Trump Media to sell stock and convertible bonds to buy bitcoin.


 Trump has said he wants to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet” and has been a proponent of the industry since resuming the presidency in 2025. 


 Business intelligence and bitcoin treasury company Strategy (MSTR), formerly known as MicroStrategy, has acquired billions of dollars in the digital currency in the past year by selling stock and convertible bonds. Strategy shares are up almost 30% so far this year entering Tuesday.


 UPDATE—May 27, 2025: This article has been updated to include the confirmation by Trump Media of its plan to raise funds to buy bitcoin.

May 27, 2025 – Sophon crypto, a pioneering project at the intersection of blockchain technology and the entertainment industry, is gaining significant momentum with its innovative approach and recent milestones. As of today, Sophon crypto has announced several major listings on prominent cryptocurrency exchanges, marking a pivotal moment in its growth and adoption.

Sophon crypto is built on the zkSync hyperchain, leveraging the ZK Stack to provide a modular Layer 2 solution tailored for the entertainment sector. Its mission is to address key challenges in content creation, distribution, and monetization by creating a transparent, efficient, and user-friendly ecosystem. By integrating blockchain technology seamlessly, Sophon crypto aims to enhance the experience for both creators and consumers, offering solutions like copyright protection, streamlined distribution, and improved monetization opportunities.

The native token, SOPH, serves multiple purposes within the ecosystem, including acting as a gas token and rewarding node operators and Guardians. Initially non-transferable during its Genesis phase, SOPHON became transferable in Q1 2025, enabling broader market participation.

Sophon crypto has recently achieved several significant milestones, including listings on major cryptocurrency exchanges, which have boosted its visibility and accessibility:

These listings, announced around May 27, 2025, reflect growing confidence in Sophon crypto's potential. The MEXC listing, in particular, offers significant incentives, encouraging user participation through its substantial prize pool. KuCoin's upcoming listing will further expand SOPH's availability across Margin, Futures, Saving, and Convert services, providing diverse trading options.

Additionally, Sophon crypto has launched Sophon Canvas, a $4M initiative aimed at supporting builders and developers within its ecosystem. This program, open for applications as of May 26, 2025, invites creators to contribute to the growth of the Sophon network, fostering innovation in the entertainment sector.

Sophon crypto places a strong emphasis on security, implementing a multifaceted framework to protect users and assets:

Hardware Wallet Storage: Users can store private keys offline, reducing the risk of cyber theft.

Adaptive Defenses: Leveraging technology from Sophos, Sophon crypto adapts to emerging cybersecurity threats in real-time, ensuring robust protection.

These measures underscore Sophon's commitment to creating a secure environment, which is critical for building trust in its blockchain-based ecosystem.

Sophon crypto is enhancing user engagement through its rewards system, Sophon+. This initiative transforms fragmented crypto interactions into cohesive, portable value, encouraging genuine participation rather than short-term farming. Sophon+ allows users to build a digital identity across the network, where engagement in one application can unlock benefits in another. This approach aligns with Sophon's vision of creating a culturally rich ecosystem of applications for consumers.

The project has also concluded Season 2 of its Yapper Leaderboard, with winners to be announced following the Token Generation Event (TGE). Season 3 is currently underway, running until June 21, 2025, offering participants opportunities to compete for rewards.

As of May 27, 2025, Sophon crypto (SOPHON) is trading at approximately $0.0009849 USD, with a 24-hour trading volume of $134,029.26 USD. Its market capitalization stands at around $32.39M, with a total supply of 42B SOPHON and 32.89B tokens in circulation. The token's all-time high was $0.001057, reached on January 15, 2025, while its all-time low was $0.000249 on August 18, 2024, reflecting significant growth.

Sophon crypto has raised $84.01M through multiple funding rounds, including Seed A and Seed B, with support from prominent crypto funds like Binance Labs and The Spartan Group. These partnerships highlight the project's credibility and potential to drive innovation in the entertainment industry.

Sophon crypto's focus on integrating blockchain with entertainment positions it as a key player in the evolving landscape of decentralized technologies. Its recent exchange listings and initiatives like Sophon Canvas suggest strong potential for growth and adoption. However, the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and Sophon's long-term success will depend on its ability to sustain user engagement, attract developers, and navigate market challenges.

The project's vision to become the definitive hub for consumer crypto experiences is ambitious yet achievable, given its technological foundation and strategic partnerships. As Sophon crypto continues to expand its presence, it is poised to transform how people interact with, own, and benefit from digital entertainment content.

A new research paper by Google Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney shows that breaking widely used RSA encryption may require 20 times fewer quantum resources than previously believed.

The finding did not specifically mention bitcoin BTC$110,024.93 or other cryptocurrencies, but took aim at the encryption methods that form the technical backbone used to secure crypto wallets and, in some cases, transactions.

RSA is a public-key encryption algorithm used to encrypt and decrypt data. It relies on two different but linked keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

Bitcoin doesn't use RSA, but relies on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). However, ECC can also be broken by Shor's algorithm, a quantum algorithm designed to factor large numbers or solve logarithm problems — which form the heart of public key cryptography.

ECC is a way to lock and unlock digital data using mathematical calculations called curves (which compute only in one direction) instead of big numbers. Think of it as a smaller key that's just as strong as a larger one.

While 256-bit ECC keys are significantly more secure than 2048-bit RSA keys, quantum threats scale nonlinearly, and research like Gidney's compresses the timeline by which such attacks become feasible.

“I estimate that a 2048-bit RSA integer could be factored in under a week by a quantum computer with fewer than one million noisy qubits,” Gidney wrote. This was a stark revision from his 2019 paper, which estimated such a feat would require 20 million qubits and take eight hours.

To be clear: no such machine exists yet. IBM's most powerful quantum processor to date, Condor, clocks in at just over 1,100 qubits, and Google's Sycamore has 53.

Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics, using quantum bits or qubits instead of traditional bits.

Unlike bits, which represent either a 0 or a 1, qubits can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously due to quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement. This allows quantum computers to perform multiple calculations at once, potentially solving problems that are currently intractable for classical computers.

“This is a 20-fold decrease in the number of qubits from our previous estimate,” Gidney said in a post.A 20x efficiency boost in quantum cost estimation for RSA may reflect algorithmic trends that could eventually apply to ECC too. RSA is still very widely used in TLS, email encryption, and certificate authorities, which are all vital to the infrastructure crypto often piggybacks on.

Researchers, such as the quantum research group Project 11, are actively exploring whether even weakened versions of Bitcoin's encryption can be broken by today's quantum hardware.

The group earlier this year launched a public bounty offering 1 BTC (~$85,000) to anyone able to break tiny ECC key sizes — between 1 and 25 bits — using a quantum computer.

The goal isn't to break Bitcoin today, but to measure how close current systems can be.

Earlier this month, CoinDesk highlighted the rising demand for the Deribit-listed $300,000 bitcoin BTC$110,024.93 call option, noting it as one of the most popular bullish plays for the all-important June quarter expiry.

Now, this bet has become the most popular in the impending quarterly expiry, reinforcing its appeal as a ""lottery ticket"" for traders anticipating a bitcoin price rally above $300,000 by the end of the next month.

At press time, the $300,000 call option was the most popular bet in the June 27 expiry, with a notional open interest of over $600 million, up from $484 million three weeks ago, according to data source Deribit. Notional open interest represents the dollar value of the number of active or open contracts at a given time. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC.

""The June $300K BTC call options have emerged as the strike with the highest open interest [in June expiry], reflecting aggressive speculative positioning by traders anticipating continued upside,"" Deribit's Asia Business Development Head Lin Chen told CoinDesk.

""The combination of record-breaking volumes and concentrated options bets signals elevated market confidence—and the potential for heightened volatility ahead,"" Chen added. 

Deribit's notional options open interest hit a record high of $42.5 billion last week. The momentum is mirrored in the platform's newly launched block RFQ (Request for Quote) system, registering a historic record of nearly $1 billion in daily volume.

A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset, BTC, at a predefined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market.

The $300,000 call expiring on June 27 represents a bet that bitcoin's price will rise three times from the present $110,000 to over $300,000 by the end of the first half.

The bet sounds outlandish, as the first half will end in roughly four weeks. But that's been the case lately on Deribit, with traders increasingly targeting upside potential through short-term options.

That is evidenced by front-end risk reversals, measuring the demand for calls relative to puts over short-term, being pricier than those with longer maturities.

The chart by Amberdata shows risk reversals are positive across the board, indicating a bias for bullish call options. However, short-duration calls are pricer than longer-duration ones. Usually, the opposite is the case.

The trend indicates a heightened appetite for quick-paced bullish bets among market participants.

""The three-day Bitcoin Conference 2025 is all set to start in Las Vegas today, and so people are speculating on what new bullish announcements will be released at the event,"" Chen explained.

The growing demand for short-duration calls could be a contrarian signal suggesting that speculative excess is often seen near market tops, according to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research.

Thielen said the options market is flashing a warning, with the seven-day calls trading at a 10% premium to puts.

""The options market is flashing a warning: Bitcoin's skew, measuring the difference in implied volatility between puts and calls, has dropped to nearly -10%, indicating calls are pricing in significantly more volatility than puts,"" Thielen said in a note to clients.

""This suggests traders are aggressively chasing upside rather than hedging downside risk. In our experience, such extreme skew levels often reflect peak bullish sentiment, a classic contrarian signal,"" Thielen added.

This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

Bitcoin's BTC$110,024.93 bull run has stalled, with emerging technical signals pointing to a possible price pullback.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value traded near $108,000 at press time, probing the bullish trendline, characterizing the sharp rise from $75K to record highs over $110K, TradingView data show.

There has been little bullish action in the past 24 hours despite reports that the Trump family media company plans to raise $3b billion to buy cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.

A key momentum indicator called the 30-day rate of change (ROC), which measures the percentage increase or decrease in bitcoin's price over the past month, has chalked out a ""bearish divergence.""

The bearish pattern happens when an asset's price rises, but momentum indicators like the 30-day rate of change (ROC) fail to confirm the same, hinting at potential weakness and price correction.

Although bitcoin remains within a bullish upward channel, the 30-day ROC is forming lower highs, signaling a bearish divergence and weakening momentum.

Additionally, the daily chart moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram, an indicator widely used to gauge trend strength and changes, has flipped negative, indicating a bearish shift in momentum.

All this means that BTC could dive out of the bullish ascending channel, potentially revisiting the major psychological resistance-turned-support at $100,000.

The broader outlook remains constructive, consistent with the recent golden cross of the 50- and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs).

 SharpLink Gaming announced a $425 million private equity deal to launch an Ether treasury and appointed Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as board chairman. 

Betting platform SharpLink Gaming has launched an Ethereum-based corporate treasury strategy and nominated Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as chairman of its board of directors, the company announced May 27.

According to the announcement, SharpLink Gaming, a publicly traded company on Nasdaq, entered into a securities purchase agreement for a private investment in public equity worth $425 million. Ethereum infrastructure firm Consensys was among the investors.

“On close, Consensys looks forward to partnering with SharpLink to explore and develop an Ethereum Treasury Strategy and to work with them in their core business as a strategic advisor,” Consensys founder and CEO Lubin said.

SharpLink Gaming's stock is up approximately 400% at the time of writing, changing hands at nearly $33.50. Trading today started at over $30 after closing under $7 the day before.

A Consensys representative told Cointelegraph that the company will not comment further until the deal is closed. Still, they confirmed Consensys' investment in SharpLink Gaming.

Alongside Consensys, the investors include venture capital firms ParaFi Capital, Electric Capital, Pantera Capital, Arrington Capital, Galaxy Digital, Ondo, White Star Capital, GSR, Hivemind Capital, Hypersphere and Primitive Ventures. SharpLink CEO Rob Phythian and the firm's CEO Robert DeLucia also participated.

The deal is expected to close “on or about May 29” if the customary closing conditions are satisfied. SharpLink Gaming intends to use the newly raised funds to jumpstart its Ether (ETH) treasury and for other general corporate purposes:

Corporate crypto treasuries are on the rise, but most of them are focused on Bitcoin (BTC). One exception was Meitu, the developer of popular Photoshop-like apps, but the company liquidated its 940 Bitcoin and 31,000 Ether at the end of last year.

Other notable examples include the Canadian subsidiary of Big Four auditor KPMG adding Ether to its treasury alongside Bitcoin in February 2022. Also, Hong Kong-based gaming firm Boyaa Interactive International held ETH, but at the end of 2024, it replaced Ether with Bitcoin.

Social media giant Reddit also acquired both Bitcoin and Ethereum, but the company was reported to have offloaded most of its holdings in late 2024. Publicly traded company BTCS also announced a $57.8 million financing agreement to purchase Ether earlier this month.

 Metaplanet's stockholders are paying a more than fivefold premium on Bitcoin spot prices, as BTC's soaring valuation discourages direct retail exposure. 

Japanese investment firm Metaplanet's Bitcoin premium has reached almost $600,000 per coin, as Asia's leading Bitcoin treasury firm pushes forward with its plan to purchase 21,000 BTC by 2026.

Metaplanet's stockholders are paying more than a fivefold premium on Bitcoin (BTC) when investing in the Japanese company, according to a report by 10x Research published on May 27.

“A little-known Japanese stock trades as if Bitcoin were worth $596,154, more than five times its actual price,” the report states.

Investors who don't understand the importance of a firm's net asset value (NAV) may be “dramatically overpaying for their Bitcoin exposure” on a position that doesn't provide additional upside leverage, the report adds.

The NAV represents the per-unit price of a fund, calculated by dividing the fund's total assets minus its liabilities by the number of outstanding shares.

Despite the significant premium, Bitcoin treasury firms like Metaplanet and Strategy are important for Bitcoin's mass adoption, as entities that are front-running “global hyperbitcoinization,” a potential $200 trillion market opportunity, according to Adam Back, co-founder and CEO of Blockstream and the inventor of Hashcash.

Metaplanet is Asia's largest and the world's 10th-largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with over 7,800 BTC worth $855 million, representing 0.037% of the total supply, Bitbo data shows.

The report comes nearly two weeks after Metaplanet purchased 1,004 BTC for $104.6 million on May 19, marking its second-largest investment to date.

Despite the fivefold premium, proxy stocks are becoming more attractive to retail investors, as Bitcoin's high price tag is discouraging direct retail participation, according to 10x Research CEO and head of research, Markus Thielen.

“Retail is only like 7% of the Bitcoin market, and that peaked toward December 2023,” Thielen told Cointelegraph, adding that retail investors “tuned out” from Bitcoin when it first crossed the $45,000 mark, which is the average cost of a new car in the US.

Other Bitcoin treasury firms are also trading at significant markups compared with spot Bitcoin prices.

Michael Saylor's Strategy is currently trading at an implied Bitcoin price of $174,100, a premium which “isn't extreme but still significant,” the report notes, adding:

While existing shareholders “cheer this on,” this may dilute the NAV per share over time, which is a cost “borne entirely by the new shareholders,” the report states.

 Analysts say that long-term Bitcoin holders have been accumulating during the recent market stress, which has seen the cryptocurrency dip just below $109,000. 

Bitcoin markets recently experienced two major liquidation events, causing a cascade of forced selling from over-leveraged traders, but analysts say a distinct pattern has emerged.

“Overleveraged short-term traders were flushed out, long-term holders have been quietly capitalizing on the reset,” CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha said on May 26. 

They noted the first flush occurred when Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $111,000, and over $97 million in long positions were liquidated. As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.

However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.

This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. Realized cap is a measure of the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was moved, rather than the current market price.

Long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin for the long run, Amr Taha noted. “This strategic accumulation during moments of market stress reflects the deep conviction of LTHs.”

“Rather than being shaken out by short-term volatility, they [LTH] see these liquidation-driven dips as prime opportunities to strengthen their positions, reinforcing the foundation for future price appreciation.”

Related: Bitcoin's new highs may have been driven by Japan bond market crisis

Meanwhile, CryptoQuant analyst Ibrahim Cosar identified a double bottom chart formation, a reversal signal that indicates “bearish pressure is weakening and buyers are beginning to regain control,” he said. 

“If this zone holds as support, levels above $112,000 are well within reach,” he predicted. 

Bitcoin is trading at just under $108,700 on Coinbase at the time of writing, posting a slight rebound from a wick down to $107,550, according to TradingView.

However, it has retreated from a high on Monday, May 26, of $110,000, having hit resistance twice at that level.

 Strategy's Michael Saylor advised against institutions publishing proof-of-reserves to show their crypto holdings, saying it's a “bad idea” that increases the risk of a security breach. 

Michael Saylor, the executive chair of major Bitcoin-buying firm Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, says institutions posting onchain proof-of-reserves is a “bad idea” that could pose security risks.

“The current, conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves,” Saylor said when asked about institutions adopting the transparency measure at a May 26 event on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.

Saylor didn't answer whether Strategy would publish its proof-of-reserves when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew whether his firm would do so.

Proof-of-reserves are common among crypto exchanges and verify that the company holds sufficient crypto reserves to cover customer deposits. They can also confirm that other entities, such as crypto-tracking exchange-traded funds, hold the required amount of crypto for the funds.

Saylor acknowledged the industry had learned from the collapses of crypto exchanges FTX and Mt. Gox, but said proof-of-reserves isn't the correct measure to take for institutions.

“Go to AI, put it in deep think mode and then ask it ‘what are the security problems of publishing your wallet addresses?' and ‘how might it undermine the security of your company over time,” Saylor said, adding it would write “50 pages of security problems.”

Many crypto exchanges, custodians and exchange-traded fund issuers started publishing their proof-of-reserves following FTX's collapse in November 2022 to establish transparency and prove that they hold enough assets to back customer deposits.

Saylor's Strategy is the world's largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 576,230 Bitcoin worth $62.6 billion on its balance sheet, followed by Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings, which holds 48,137 Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET.

Otodus megalodon was the largest predatory fish in Earth's history: Measuring up to 24 meters, it was longer than a truck with a trailer and weighed almost twice as much. Embedded in its jaws were triangular teeth the size of a hand, and its bite had the force of an industrial hydraulic press. It swam through the world's oceans between 20 and 3 million years ago, frequently on the hunt for prey to satisfy a calorie demand as vast as its size: According to estimates, it required around 100,000 kilocalories per day. Science widely assumed that megalodon's main calorie intake was in the form of whales.

At least that's what it did should a whale come long, says Dr. Jeremy McCormack from the Department of Geosciences at Goethe University Frankfurt. It appears, after all, that megalodon partook of a much broader range of prey than previously assumed, as the geoscientist discovered together with scientists from Germany, France, Austria and the US. The researchers examined fossilized megalodon teeth, which are more or less all that has remained of the cartilaginous fish that gave the shark its name, megalodon, meaning ""big tooth.""

The researchers extracted zinc from the fossil teeth, an element that occurs in atomic variants (isotopes) of different weights. Zinc is ingested with food, whereby less of the heavier isotope zinc-66 than the lighter isotope zinc-64 is stored in muscles and organs. Accordingly, the tissue of fish that eat fish absorbs significantly less zinc-66, and those which, in turn, hunt them for food absorb even less. That is why Otodus megalodon and its close relative Otodus chubutensis had the lowest ratio of zinc-66 to zinc-64 at the top of the food chain.

""Since we don't know how the ratio of the two zinc isotopes at the bottom of the food pyramid was at that time, we compared the teeth of various prehistoric and extant shark species with each other and with other animal species. This enabled us to gain an impression of predator-prey relationships 18 million years ago,"" explains McCormack. The giant teeth they used for their study mostly came from fossil deposits in Sigmaringen and Passau -- 18 million years ago, a relatively shallow estuary, less than 200 meters deep, flowed along the Alps, teeming with various other shark species alongside megalodon.

McCormack explains: ""Sea bream, which fed on mussels, snails and crustaceans, formed the lowest level of the food chain we studied. Smaller shark species such as requiem sharks and ancestors of today's cetaceans, dolphins and whales, were next. Larger sharks such as sand tiger sharks were further up the food pyramid, and at the top were giant sharks like Araloselachus cuspidatus and the Otodus sharks, which include megalodon."" McCormack stresses, however, that the Otodus sharks cannot be sharply differentiated from the lower levels of the pyramid: ""Megalodon was by all means flexible enough to feed on marine mammals and large fish, from the top of the food pyramid as well as lower levels -- depending on availability.""

According to McCormack, this means that the idea of Otodus sharks homing in on marine mammals when it comes to food needs to be revised: ""Our study tends rather to draw a picture of megalodon as an ecologically versatile generalist."" Comparisons between the fossils from Sigmaringen and Passau, for example, showed that the creatures from Passau fed more on prey from lower levels of the food pyramid, which also points to regional differences in the range of prey or changes in its availability at different times.

Analyzing teeth on the basis of zinc content is a very new method, and McCormack is delighted with the comprehensive and coherent results it produced not only for prehistoric shark and whale species but also for herbivorous prehistoric rhinoceroses and even shark species that exist today. McCormack: ""Determining tooth zinc isotope ratios has once again proven to be a valuable instrument for paleoecological reconstructions."" ""It gives us important insights into how the marine communities have changed over geologic time, but more importantly the fact that even 'supercarnivores' are not immune to extinction,"" adds Kenshu Shimada, a paleobiologist at DePaul University in Chicago, USA, and a coauthor of the new study. Previous studies, including one led by McCormack, indicated that, at least in part, the rise of the modern great white shark is to blame for the demise of Otodus megalodon.

Metrics details

Reconstructing how prehistoric humans used the products obtained from large cetaceans is challenging, but key to understand the history of early human coastal adaptations. Here we report the multiproxy analysis (ZooMS, radiocarbon, stable isotopes) of worked objects made of whale bone, and unworked whale bone fragments, found at Upper Paleolithic sites (Magdalenian) around the Bay of Biscay. Taxonomic identification using ZooMS reveals at least five species of large whales, expanding the range of known taxa whose products were utilized by humans in this period. Radiocarbon places the use of whale products ca. 20–14 ka cal BP, with a maximum diffusion and diversity at 17.5–16 ka cal BP, making it the oldest evidence of whale-bone working to our knowledge. δ13C and δ15N stable isotope values reflect taxon-specific differences in foraging behavior. The diversity and chronology of these cetacean populations attest to the richness of the marine ecosystem of the Bay of Biscay in the late Paleolithic, broadening our understanding of coastal adaptations at that time.

Whales are the largest living animals on Earth and the current populations of many species are a mere fraction of their abundance in the past1. Before intensive whaling depleted the populations of most species, whales were a valuable source of food and other resources (e.g., oil, bone, baleen2). They were thus a key part of subsistence for many coastal human groups worldwide, including hunter-gatherers and Neolithic farmers, with acquisition methods that included scavenging freshly beached animals, opportunistic killing and organized whaling2,3,4,5,6,7,8. However, reconstructing the beginning of whale utilization is challenging because prehistoric coastal sites are an especially fragile part of the archeological record, many of them having been lost to marine erosion or flooded by the last marine transgressions9. In most cases, the only available evidence is indirect, in the form of materials of coastal origin transported by people into inland sites. In Europe, a number of sites attributed to the Middle and Upper Magdalenian culture (ca. 19-14 ka cal BP, or 19-14 millennia before present, at the end of MIS2) in southwestern France and in Atlantic Iberia have yielded an invaluable record of this type of evidence10: whale barnacles attesting to the transport of whale skin, blubber and meat11; unworked whale bones transported and processed at the habitation site12; worked whale teeth13; and, especially, more than 150 tools and projectile heads made of whale bone presumably of Atlantic origin, mostly found scattered from Asturias to the central part of the northern Pyrenean range14. This record, mostly identified within the last ten years, represents (to our knowledge) the oldest evidence of a regular utilization of whale products by humans, for dietary needs and raw materials10.

Understanding this Magdalenian utilization of whale products is of crucial importance, not only because it opens a window into early human interactions with whales, but more broadly because of the light it sheds onto the history of human coastal adaptations. Indeed, even though the earliest evidence of the use of coastal resources in Europe dates back to the Middle Paleolithic (older than 40 ka cal BP, and up to ca. 150 ka BP15,16,17), and similar evidence exists for the Early Upper Paleolithic18, the richness and diversity of evidence related to seashore exploitation increases dramatically in association with the Magdalenian culture. Despite a sea level rise of ca. 120 m since that period making the Magdalenian shoreline inaccessible to today's archeologists, depictions of marine animals, remains of seals, dolphins, marine fish and birds, the use of marine mollusks as food and the use of their shells as raw material for ornaments, are all attested with unprecedented frequency and wide diffusion in the Middle and Upper Magdalenian, especially in Iberia and in the Pyrenees10,19,20. This combined evidence points to a stronger link with the seashore compared to the earlier part of the European Upper Paleolithic, suggesting the inception of a settled coastal economy in certain parts of Europe at this time. Understanding the role that whale products played in this process is thus key to the ongoing investigations into the existence, chronology and organization of hunter-gatherer early coastal adaptations, a subject that is today considered central in prehistoric research21,22,23. However, the information provided by the whale remains found in Magdalenian assemblages is limited for several reasons. First, it is unknown to which whale species they correspond. Indeed, these remains were identified only through visual macroscopic criteria and most of them are small, fragmented and/or worked, thus precluding any precise anatomical or taxonomic identification beyond the cetacean category. Furthermore, although these morphological criteria are robust, they have a margin of uncertainty, meaning that some of the remains are classified only as “likely” made of cetacean bone14,24. Since different whale species have different ecologies and feeding behavior, this generic (and sometimes uncertain) identification as cetacean gives only low resolution insight into the range of interactions that foragers could have had with these animals, and deprives us of the environmental information that the presence of certain particular whale species could indicate25. Finally, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the dating of these whale remains. Because of their typology, their stratigraphic context, and the characteristics of the archeological assemblages they were found in, they can be attributed to the Magdalenian period in the broad sense of the term. But since the majority are from ancient excavations with poor chrono-stratigraphic resolution, they can only be collectively ascribed to a broad time span of several millennia, precluding a precise reconstruction of the chronology, rhythm and evolution of the utilization of whale products.

Here we analyze a large sample of worked bone objects (n = 83) from 26 Magdalenian cave and rockshelter sites in the Cantabrian region and southwestern France, all visually identified as made of whale bone (Supplementary Data 1 and 2, Supplementary Figs. 1 through 64). We also analyze 90 unworked bone fragments from the single assemblage of Santa Catalina cave (Biscay), also ascribed to whale on a visual basis, found among the faunal remains of the site's Upper Magdalenian occupation and showing traces of anthropic processing (notably percussion notches: Supplementary Figs. 65 through 90). We sampled these for taxonomic identification through collagen peptide mass fingerprinting (ZooMS, or Zooarcheology by Mass Spectrometry26,27). Thirty-seven of the worked objects and 31 of the unworked bone fragments were also sampled for radiocarbon dating using the compact AMS ECHoMICADAS, and for carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis (δ13C and δ15N).

In this work, we assess the range of whale taxa whose products were utilized by the Magdalenian foragers and the chronology of this utilization, showing that these groups availed themselves of the carcasses of at least five species starting ca. 20-19 ka cal BP, with a peak time ca. 17.5-16 ka cal BP. The results of the stable isotope analysis, placed in the context of patterns of isotopic niche partitioning among contemporary whales, contribute to reconstructing whales' relative foraging behavior and past ocean ecology, showing that the distribution of the stable isotope ratios in Paleolithic whales is structured by taxa and overlaps to some extent with those of their modern counterparts, suggesting broadly similar feeding strategies and analogies with today's arctic water communities. Even though the Paleolithic seashore itself is no longer accessible, and the range of taxa identified here might not reflect the full range of species present in the Bay of Biscay at that period, the analysis of these whale bones brought inland by the hunter-gatherers opens a unique window into whale ecology and the marine environments in the northeastern Atlantic at that period, and on the timing and nature of their utilization by human groups.

Of the 173 bone specimens (83 worked objects and 90 bone fragments) analyzed with ZooMS, all but four yielded a taxonomic identification, demonstrating the power of this approach to identify taxa on highly transformed and/or fragmented remains of late Pleistocene age. Of the 83 worked objects, 71 were confirmed as cetaceans, while 8 were identified as large terrestrial mammals and 4 did not yield a ZooMS identification, indicating that the macroscopic visual attribution was correct in 90% of the cases (71/79). The visual misidentification of 8 objects made of bone from large terrestrial mammals was due to their thoroughly porous aspect, normally a diagnostic feature of whale bones, but also present in some anatomical elements of certain terrestrial species (in this case mammoth, rhinoceros, reindeer and equids), and that can be misleading when dealing with small, fragmented objects. Of the 90 unworked bone fragments, the attribution as cetacean was confirmed for 60 bones (67%), with the other 30 being identified mostly as large land mammals, but also one seal. The higher error rate for Santa Catalina (33% vs. 10%) is a consequence of the fact that the visual selection of putative whale-bone fragments was more inclusive at this site (see “Methods” below).

Overall, ZooMS analyses of 131 cetacean specimens reveal the presence of at least six cetacean taxa in the northeastern Atlantic during the Magdalenian (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 3): fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus (n = 65); sperm whale, Physeter macrocephalus (n = 32); gray whale, Eschrichtius robustus (n = 11); blue whale, Balaenoptera musculus (n = 2); one species of porpoise (harbor porpoise or Dall's porpoise, Phocoenidae, n = 1); and at least one species of Balaenid whale (Balaenidae), with 13 samples that can be attributed either to the North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis, or to the bowhead whale, Balaena mysticetus (two species that are indistinguishable using ZooMS), both present in the North Atlantic. The remaining 7 samples yielded ZooMS spectra that could not be attributed to a precise cetacean taxon. Among the six cetacean taxa, only the sperm whale had previously been unambiguously documented in the Magdalenian record, through the presence of two carved teeth and several depictions on other portable objects from the Bay of Biscay region28. The other taxa—fin whale, gray whale, blue whale, right and/or bowhead whale and porpoise—had (to our knowledge) previously not been identified in this archeological context.

Of the 37 worked objects sampled for radiocarbon dating, 5 failed as a result of poor collagen preservation, while the remaining 32 yielded results (Fig. 2, and see “Methods” below for calibration and caveats). The two earliest dates are from the Cantabrian sites of Rascaño and El Juyo, ca. 20.2-19.6 and 19.6-19 ka cal BP, respectively. The two artifacts were found among assemblages attributed to the Cantabrian Lower Magdalenian (Rascaño IVb and El Juyo 8), and our results confirm this archeological association.

All circles correspond to worked objects except site 8, which is the assemblage of unworked fragments of whale bone from Santa Catalina. The size of the circles is proportional to the numbers of remains per site, except in Santa Catalina, where all the unworked remains are considered as a single one so as not to overwrite the representation. Bathymetric data are from Natural Earth (www.naturalearthdata.com).

Only four worked objects, from three sites in the western Pyrenees and Cantabria (Duruthy, Isturitz and El Pendo), yielded dates in the 19-17.5 ka cal BP time range. The chronological distribution of the dates then shows a sharp rise to the 17.5-16 ka cal BP time range, with 26 objects from 12 sites (from west to east, 2 from La Paloma, 1 from Las Caldas, 3 from Ermittia, 1 from Urtiaga, 1 from Iruroin, 5 from Isturitz, 1 from Bourrouilla, 2 from Duruthy, 3 from Brassempouy, 2 from Saint-Michel, 3 from Mas d'Azil and 2 from La Vache), accompanied by a wide geographic extension from Asturias (Las Caldas) to the central Pyrenees (La Vache, Le Mas d'Azil) and a maximal diversity of taxa used. The distribution of the dates ends abruptly after ca. 16 ka cal BP.

At Santa Catalina, from the 31 fragments of unworked whale bone sampled for radiocarbon dating, all but one yielded reliable results (Fig. 2). The two fragments attributed to the North Atlantic right whale or bowhead whale (one of which was dated three times) yielded identical 14C dates and might come from a single individual that died ca. 16.5-16 ka cal BP. The 28 other dates are all from fragments of fin whale bone and, with one exception, cluster between ca. 16-14.5 ka cal BP (thus after the 17.5-16 ka cal BP time range that yielded most of the dates on worked objects). The number of acquisition events represented by these 27 dates remains undetermined, and the degree of fragmentation of the bones precludes the calculation of an anatomical Minimum Number of Individuals; but the distribution of the dates appears compatible with a minimum of two individuals, one ca. 15.5 and one ca. 15 ka cal BP. A single date ca. 13.6–13.2 ka cal BP is the only possible evidence of a later episode of bone acquisition on a fin whale individual.

Carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotope ratios were successfully measured in 55 whale bone samples and ranged from −16.8‰ to −11.6‰ in δ13C ratios and from 9.1‰ to 17.5‰ in δ15N ratios (Fig. 3). In total, 8 samples failed collagen extraction, 2 samples failed IRMS analysis and for 7 samples the atomic C:N ratio was too high (ranging between 3.77 and 6.28) or the N peak was below 700 mV (Supplementary Data 1).

The open circle indicates the position of the one sample where ZooMS failed to distinguish between right/bowhead/fin whale. See Supplementary Data 4, tab “PaleoCet material”, for source data, and Supplementary Data 1 for more details on samples.

The distribution of the stable isotope ratios is structured by taxa: fin whale samples are clustered at low δ15N values and (with one exception) intermediate values of δ13C; the single blue whale sample is nested among the fin whales; right/bowhead whale samples show low δ13C ratios and intermediate values of δ15N; gray whales display high δ13C ratios and intermediate values of δ15N; and sperm whales show elevated values both of δ15N values and δ13C (Table 1). The one sample where ZooMS failed to distinguish between right/bowhead and fin whales—due to the overall poor quality of the spectra and specifically the absence of a clear peptide marker at P2_ɑ2 292—is nested within the fin whale samples, strongly suggesting it might have corresponded to a fin whale (Fig. 3). We found no evidence that these patterns of stable isotopic signatures across taxa are driven by differences in the radiocarbon age of samples: there was no significant relationship between conventional 14C age and the δ13C values (see Methods below, and Supplementary Fig. 98).

A comparison between the stable isotopic signatures of Paleolithic whale samples with modern counterparts shows in most cases an overlap (at least partial) between the two. The large majority of modern samples used for this comparison originate from the same oceanic basin (Atlantic) as our samples, except for gray whale (Pacific) (Supplementary Data 4). Still, on average we found higher δ13C and δ15N ratios in ancient fin whales, higher δ15N ratios in ancient sperm whales, and higher δ13C ratios in bowhead/right whales and in gray whales when compared with modern whales (Supplementary Discussion, and Supplementary Figs. 99 through 102).

A previous study of whale-bone objects from the Cantabrian coast suggested that, according to contextual evidence (both archeological and radiocarbon), the utilization of whale bone might have appeared in this region and in this archeological context ca. 18–17.5 ka cal BP14. Our results confirm this archeological association and the earlier evidence of whale-bone working the Cantabrian region, and push back the chronology of its inception by at least one millennium (with the caveat of radiocarbon dating uncertainty; see Methods below). The whale bones used for tool manufacture do not necessarily come from fresh carcasses, but they are unlikely to have been more than a few decades old, given the hazards of bone preservation in the open air on the seashore29, and given that the low density of cetacean bones30 suggests that they will be particularly susceptible to density-mediated attrition31. Accordingly, at our level of chronological resolution, the date of the material is essentially the same as the date of the bone working activity. Therefore, according to our results, the manufacturing of implements made of whale bone began ca. 20-19 ka cal BP on the southern shores of the Bay of Biscay. Since the visual identification of whale-bone objects from more ancient (Gravettian) archeological contexts remains uncertain32,33, these 20-19 ka cal BP dates represent to our knowledge the oldest evidence for the working of whale bone by hunter-gatherers. They place the inception of this industry at the beginning of the Late Glacial, when the sea level began to rise again after the LGM lowstand34. Between ca. 17.5 and 16 ka cal BP, the amount of archeological evidence increases sharply and the geographic distribution of the objects expands, encompassing an area between Asturias and the central Pyrenees, perhaps with an extension to the north and east of the Aquitaine Basin (given their archeological context, the objects found at La Madeleine, Dordogne, and Courbet, Tarn, might indeed date to the same period35,36,37). This period, which archeologically corresponds to the Middle Magdalenian in the Cantabrian region and the Late Middle Magdalenian in southwest France38, thus appears as the peak time for the production and diffusion of objects made of whale bone. No chronological trend appears regarding the type of objects manufactured or the taxa used, and this period in general can be considered as representing the maximum diffusion and diversity of this whale-bone industry. This is in accordance with other categories of archeological evidence showing the existence of active exchange/diffusion networks between the Cantabrian coast and the central Pyrenees at that time (lithic raw materials, art, and types of tools14).

Most of the objects made of whale bone are weapon elements (projectile points and foreshafts) typologically similar to the antler points that make up a large part of the Magdalenian hunting equipment39. From what can be observed on the finished objects, and on the few pieces of manufacturing waste documented37, the manufacturing techniques used to work whale bone into objects do not differ from those used for working antler. The choice of using whale bone to make one part of the weapon tips might be linked to the dimensions of the raw material, that make it possible to manufacture very long implements, and perhaps the specific mechanical properties of whale bone as compared to antler and to terrestrial bone14,24,40.

The chronological distribution of the whale-bone objects ends abruptly after ca. 16 ka cal BP. The only worked object that might be attributed to a later date is the whale-bone foreshaft from the Upper Magdalenian site of Andernach, in Rhineland—an object that was found to be made of gray whale bone in this study, and that can be attributed to ca. 16–15.5 ka cal BP according to the AMS dates from the context in which it was discovered40. Compared to the rest of the samples, this object is thus both the most geographically outlying and the most recent. Only tentative explanations can be put forth to explain this rarefaction. The period ca. 16–14 ka cal BP corresponds archeologically to the Upper Magdalenian—a cultural phase that, like the preceding one, yielded evidence for the exploitation of a number of coastal resources (such as mollusks10). The acquisition of fin whale carcasses at Santa Catalina after 16 ka cal BP, and the presence of a foreshaft made of gray whale bone at Andernach with contextual dates younger than 16 ka cal BP, both show that hunter-gatherer groups still had access to whale bone at that period. Therefore, the nearly complete lack of evidence for whale-bone working after 16 ka cal BP is not linked to an abandonment of coastal resources, or to a lack of suitable raw material or of technical skill. It could thus be either a purely cultural and technical choice (a disregard for whale bone as a raw material for tool making), or a question of archeological visibility linked to the interruption of the whale-bone diffusion networks. Indeed, since the whale-bone objects were probably manufactured on the seashore14,24, all objects of this type found at inland sites are imports. If the exchange and circulation dynamics that are responsible for the diffusion of these objects ceased to function, the whale-bone objects likely remained at the coastal sites, which are now submerged. There is currently no way to discriminate between those two hypotheses.

The taxa identified in this study provide a picture of the rich biodiversity of cetaceans in the northeastern Atlantic during the Magdalenian period that may have been accessible to hunter-gatherers. With its highly productive waters and complex bathymetry, the Bay of Biscay remains today an area of high diversity and abundance of cetacean species41, but it may have been even more so in the past, given that multiple species were subsequently subject to intensive exploitation1. In addition, the climate in the Bay of Biscay was substantially cooler during the Magdalenian period, with sea ice likely present at least seasonally42, which means that the cetacean community may have more closely resembled that of today's arctic waters. Given the role large cetaceans play in marine ecosystem functionality, these differences in cetacean composition and abundance may have translated into non-negligible effects on local primary productivity, with cascading effects across the broader ecosystem43,44,45.

Fin whales, sperm whales, blue whales and harbor porpoises are still present in the Bay of Biscay today41. Given their wide distribution, including cold waters46, it is not surprising that they were also present during the Magdalenian period, but they may have been more abundant prior to human exploitation1. Our results show that at least one balaenid species was found in the Bay of Biscay at the time, although the imprecision of the ZooMS ID does not allow for a distinction between right and bowhead whales; DNA analysis would be required to verify the species identities for these specimens (analyses which fell outside the scope of this study). Both species were heavily exploited in the western North Atlantic, with right whales now extirpated47 and bowheads nearly so48. Right whales were present in the Bay of Biscay until relatively recent times, where a coastal calving ground formed the basis of a Basque whaling industry from the 11th–18th centuries47. In the cooler Magdalenian waters42, it is more likely that right whales, if present, were using the area as summer feeding grounds. The sea-ice bound bowhead whales could have been a more likely species, with stable isotope data also providing some support in this direction (Supplementary Fig. 101). It is not impossible that both species could have been present, in different seasons.

The case of gray whales is more specific. Gray whales today have a strictly North Pacific distribution: they do not seem to have survived in the North Atlantic after the eighteenth century, having likely disappeared due to whaling despite the circumstances of their disappearance remaining poorly understood7,49. Previous evidence of their past presence in the North Atlantic dates either to the Holocene (10 to 0.25 ka cal BP) or to the middle of the Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS3), before 40 ka cal BP; with the absence of gray whales in the intervening period attributed to a drastic reduction or even extirpation of Atlantic gray whale50,51,52. Furthermore, molecular analyses revealed little genetic continuity between the late Pleistocene and the Holocene populations: most Atlantic Holocene specimens analyzed by Alter et al.50 are genetically closer to Holocene Pacific gray whales than to Pleistocene Atlantic specimens. This led these authors to suggest that the majority of the Atlantic Holocene population were the result of a second colonization event from the Pacific, after warming temperatures, sea-level rise, and decreases in sea ice permitted passage through the Bering Strait50. The 11 artifacts made of bones from gray whales presented here are evidence of the presence of this species in Atlantic waters at the end of MIS2, thus supporting a continuity between the Pleistocene and the Holocene populations.

The stable isotope composition of marine vertebrates is controlled by their diet and habitat preferences53,54 and thus the stable isotope dataset presented in this study sheds light onto past whale ecology. In general, the stable isotopic signatures of Paleolithic whales overlap to some extent with those of their modern counterparts, suggesting broadly similar feeding strategies, while existing differences can be ascribed to variation in stable isotope baseline values, feeding ground locations and possibly trophic level (Supplementary Discussion). As in modern whales, ancient fin whales and blue whale samples have relatively low nitrogen stable isotope ratios in comparison with the other whale samples, consistent with these species' reliance on krill55,56, whereas gray whales display higher δ13C ratios, characteristic for their feeding behavior in benthic environments57, while sperm whales (the only toothed whale species in this dataset) show the most elevated δ15N values, reflecting a diet at a higher trophic level including large squid58 (Fig. 3). The fact that bowhead/right whales (which feed mostly on copepods) have higher δ15N values than fin whales (again, also found in modern whales) is less straightforward to explain, but likely explained by feeding in different water masses, highlighting the complexity of interpreting isotopic signatures (Supplementary Discussion). This said, in most cases the overlap in stable isotope signatures between modern and ancient whale samples is only partial, with ancient whales tending to exhibit higher δ15N and/or δ13C values. These differences may reflect a shift in whale feeding preferences (e.g., if modern whales now target prey at lower trophic levels or warmer waters), large scale temporal changes in the stable isotope baseline59, environmental change, or a combination. Indeed, previous studies found rapid changes in whale feeding behavior (and in corresponding stable isotope signatures) as a result of environmental changes: for example, Jory et al.60 found that a reduction in biomass of artic krill coincided with a dietary niche widening in fin whales in Canadian waters, with 60% of individuals changing their foraging strategy from specialist to generalist feeders in order to reduce intraspecific competition. Given the magnitude of the environmental change from the Late Pleistocene to the present, the changes in whale foraging strategies may well have been even stronger.

The stable isotope analysis complements the ZooMS results in showing a clear differentiation between whale species, and furthermore allowed us to identify as likely fin whale one specimen for which identification through ZooMS was imprecise (Fig. 3). It also suggests a higher likelihood that the Balaenidae samples correspond to bowhead whales rather than right whales (Supplementary Fig. 101) although this is less certain. While the arctic conditions in the region would favor the bowhead hypothesis, the region could similarly have functioned as a northerly feeding ground for right whales. These results highlight the added value of combining multiple analytical methods to maximize the information obtained from archeological records of human-whale interactions2,53.

With the exception of the object from Andernach, all our specimens come from karstic environments (cave and rockshelter sites) with good preservation of osseous material, including small elements. The relative abundance of the different whale taxa in our sample is thus unlikely to be affected by taphonomic factors such as differential preservation of bone tissues. However, these proportions cannot be used to infer the relative frequency of the whale taxa in the past, because they are biased by the anthropic choices of the Magdalenian hunter-gatherers and by our sampling strategy. For example, the scarcity of the harbor porpoise remains might reflect a lower value of the bones of this smaller species for tool manufacture. Conversely, the large proportion of fin whales in our sample is biased by our decision to systematically analyze the whale bones from Santa Catalina, where this taxon dominates.

The taxonomic composition of the whale-bone assemblage gives nonetheless an indication of the way hunter-gatherers acquired the whale resources. The worked objects and unworked bone fragments we analyzed are mainly large cetaceans that predominantly forage offshore or in areas with deep water close to shore like the Bay of Biscay—namely fin whale, sperm whale and blue whale. It is extremely unlikely that these species would have been accessible to hunter-gatherers from the European Pleistocene other than through passive acquisition methods, such as the opportunistic acquisition of natural strandings or drift whales. In addition, the list of identified taxa also includes species whose ecology brings them substantially closer to the coast, namely gray whales, right/bowhead whales and harbor porpoises46. Bowhead whales and gray whales are the large cetaceans with the longest recorded history of active whaling, going back at least three millennia in arctic ecosystems53,61. However, there is no evidence that European Pleistocene hunter-gatherers had the necessary technologies for hunting these species, such as seafaring62, or multibarbed points that could have been used as harpoons heads (barbed points appear in the local archeological record only after 16 ka cal BP39). Overall, then, the archeological evidence points towards an opportunistic acquisition of whale resources in the Bay of Biscay during the Magdalenian period, unlike in more recent periods where this same region became an area of active whaling7,47.

Whales were likely familiar to coastal communities, and as such may well have played an important role in the Magdalenian cultural world. The Bay of Biscay's highly productive waters make it a cetacean hotspot today41, and it was likely already the case during the Pleistocene. Along the Spanish coast in particular, water depth increases dramatically just a few kilometers from the coastline, bringing species that are typically found offshore, such as fin whales63, unusually close. These species could have been observed from high points along the coastline spouting at a distance, and irregularly closer to shore as dead or moribund individuals. The more coastal right/bowhead whales, gray whales and harbor porpoise were likely even better known. Gray whales in particular are the most coastal of the whale species46, spending summer at low-depth high-latitude feeding grounds, then migrate hugging the coastline to warmer lower-latitude calving areas in sheltered low-depth lagoons. Whereas in today's climate the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean would more likely correspond to calving grounds, it is possible that during the cooler Upper Paleolithic climate they would have corresponded to feeding grounds49,64—habitat reconstructions indicate that adequate shallow shelf habitat was available there during the last glaciation50. In any case, they would have been conspicuously present at predictable seasons, and they are likely to have been part of the range of animals whose ecology would have been well known to Paleolithic hunter-gatherers.

The whale remains analyzed in this study attest to two different utilization behaviors. The first one is the use of whale bones as raw material for the manufacture of implements; as suggested in previous studies, the choice of this raw material might have been motivated by the large dimensions of these bones, enabling the manufacture of longer implements, and maybe their specific mechanical properties14,24. The two main types of objects manufactured are projectile points and foreshafts, both relating to hunting equipment. Thirty-three projectile points were analyzed with ZooMS, and the results show that the range of species used for their manufacture is varied, with a relative majority of sperm whale (13 of the 31 points whose species could be identified, i.e., 42%; vs. 3-23% for each of the 5 other species identified). For the 11 foreshafts analyzed, the dominance of sperm whale is even more pronounced (8 of 11: 73%). It is uncertain whether this higher frequency compared to the other taxa reflects the relative abundance of sperm whales among stranded individuals or if it testifies to a preference for this species on the part of the Magdalenian carvers. The second hypothesis might be supported by the fact that, among the large cetaceans present in our sample, sperm whales are the only toothed species, displaying a highly characteristic, long, straight, toothed jawbone that may have been considered as a particularly desirable block of raw material. An interest in sperm whale teeth in the Magdalenian is also evidenced by the two carved specimens found at Las Caldas and Mas d'Azil10. Nevertheless, since the precise anatomical parts used for tool-making are so far indeterminate, this supposition remains speculative.

The second utilization behavior, evidenced at Santa Catalina, is the transportation of unworked whale bones to habitation sites. The bones were found in the form of fragments, most of which are too small and fragmented to be identified anatomically; still, some of them can be attributed to ribs and to vertebrae (cf. fragments of vertebral disks), evidencing the presence of portions from the trunk, and several display percussion notches indicating anthropic breakage carried out at or outside the site. The transportation of these elements requires explanation, as the species involved (fin whale and right/bowhead whale) are large, and the site was by then 4-5 km from the coast and 70 m up a steep cliff65. Indeed, bones of large whales are bulky elements, usually abandoned on the spot where the whale is processed rather than carried as riders attached to the meat and blubber. Their use as implements at the site (ribs for building huts, vertebrae as stools or anvils, etc.) is implausible given their degree of fragmentation, and evidence for their use as raw material for toolmaking is very scarce. Only one fragment shows traces of scraping, and most of the elements are very spongy, while the whale-bone objects known from other sites show a denser osseous tissue indicating the use of denser parts of the skeleton. An alternative explanation is their use as bone fuel for hearths. The use of the bones of terrestrial mammals as fuel is frequently documented in Paleolithic contexts66, and activities linked to fire, including bone fuel, are intensive in level III of Santa Catalina (presence of charcoal, hearth-like structures, etc.67). However, at Santa Catalina the whale bones we analyzed are not specifically affected by burning, nor concentrated near the hearths; if the collecting of whale bone at this site has to do with fire, it could only be as a reserve for later use. Alternatively, since living animal whale bones are very rich in fat, these large spongy bones might have been brought to collect the oil by letting them drip, or by crushing them2. This hypothesis would explain the fragmentation of the bones. It is consistent with the strong interest of Paleolithic groups for fat (e.g., the nearly systematic breakage of the bones for marrow68), and with the fact that bone grease rendering is evidenced in the level III of Santa Catalina on the bones of ungulates69.

Finally, although our archeological sample includes only bones and bone objects, their presence shows that hunter-gatherers also had access to other whale resources2. Whale skin, blubber and meat found numerous dietary and technical uses among populations of the past, and the transportation of (at least) whale skin to the habitat was already evidenced among European hunter-gatherers through the discovery of right whale barnacles at the sites of Las Caldas, Nerja and Cueva Victoria11. Furthermore, the identification of several species of mysticetes in our sample proves that Magdalenian hunter-gatherers also had access to baleen plates. The baleen of right and bowhead whales in particular have long been appreciated as a strong and flexible material with many practical uses in several populations2. In this case, the osseous material acts as a proxy for other resources with more rapid rates of degradation.

This study provided a chronological and taxonomic characterization of Late Paleolithic whale-bone industry. Its inception on the southern shores of the Bay of Biscay takes place within a more general trend towards the intensification of the exploitation of coastal resources at that period and in that region. The acquisition of whale products seems limited to the opportunistic utilization of beached or drift whales, but likely included the use of many resources besides bones—including baleen, the availability of which is now demonstrated, and whale oil, as possibly evidenced by the presence of unworked and fragmented bones at Santa Catalina. For this reason, stranding events certainly affected the groups' mobility patterns by acting as attractive spots. In this perspective, although whales might not have been the primary impulse for the increased interest in the seashore during the Magdalenian, their presence undoubtedly contributed to this evolution and strengthened it, as was suggested for other regions70. Furthermore, the taxonomic diversity and chronological depth of the cetacean populations identified in this study—both previously undocumented for this region at this time period—attest to the richness of the marine and coastal ecosystem of the Bay of Biscay at the end of the Paleolithic, showing how much it represented a favorable milieu for human settlement.

The archeological specimens analyzed in this study are curated in 10 museums in France, 7 museums in Spain, 1 museum in the United Kingdom, 1 museum in Germany, and 3 curatorial repositories in France, under the responsibility of the Ministry of Culture, for collections from sites with excavations in progress. The location of each analyzed specimen can be found in Supplementary Data 1. Permission to access, study, borrow or export (when relevant), and sample the specimens was obtained from each institution, curator and/or excavation director following each local procedure (see detailed list in Acknowledgements section).

A total of 185 worked objects visually identified as made of whale bone are known from 31 Magdalenian sites (Supplementary Data 2: 165 objects from previous studies14,24,40,71, plus 20 recently discovered through excavations or the reassessment of ancient collections). Minimally-invasive ZooMS analysis was tested on a subset of the samples, but proved to be unsuccessful (see below). In order to maintain the morphological integrity of the worked bone assemblage, a destructive ZooMS approach was applied to 83 of the 185 objects (i.e., 45%), with samples selected to ensure a representative selection of sites (n = 26) and of the objects' typology (these 83 objects include 3 ZooMS results previously published36,37). In addition, at Santa Catalina, 41 unworked bone fragments had previously (i.e., before this study) been attributed to cetaceans on a visual basis12. In this study, the bone assemblage of Santa Catalina was reassessed and sampled to include all fragments that could potentially be whale bone, even if the morphological identification remained somewhat uncertain. A total of 90 unworked bone fragments from Santa Catalina (the 41 previously identified + 49 new specimens) were subjected to ZooMS analysis, mostly from archeological level III.

Half of the elements whose identification as whale bone was confirmed by ZooMS were subject to additional sampling for radiocarbon dating and stable isotope analysis: 37 of the 71 worked objects (52%), and 31 of the 60 bones from Santa Catalina (52%). The single object identified as made of porpoise bone through ZooMS analysis was a thin fragment of point, and permission was not granted to sample material sufficient for both ZooMS and 14C dating.

Before any sampling, photogrammetry was used to produce a 3D model of each worked object and each unworked bone fragment in its entirety. This was done for conservation reasons, in order to preserve a digital copy of the specimens before they were morphologically altered by the sampling. Each bone selected for sampling was photographed using a Nikon reflex with 40 or 60 mm lens, a portable light tent with different lights to provide diffuse light, and a turntable with markers for metric projection and angular notations. The Adobe® Photoshop® software was used for post-processing (color adjustment and background masking) and the Agisoft® Metashape® software was used for the photogrammetric process. For each artifact, both a dense cloud (for accuracy studies) and a textured mesh (for exports and measurements) were produced.

Depending on the shape of each element, sampling was done either: by cutting a piece from one of the extremities of the bone (using either a Stanley® mini hacksaw or a Dremel® rotary tool); by drilling with a Proxxon® Colt 2 pocket drill; or by coring using homemade diamond-coated core drills, 4–6 mm in diameter, mounted on a Moviluty® Minyflex® rotary tool. On average, 75.7 mg of bone was extracted from each specimen for ZooMS, with no significant difference between the worked objects and the unworked bone fragments. For radiocarbon dating only, the average mass of the sample was 95.3 mg on the worked objects, and 340.6 mg on the unworked fragments from Santa Catalina.

ZooMS was first developed as a destructive analytical technique, requiring ~10–30 mg of bone or bone powder for analysis26. This project aimed to limit the destructive testing of unique, Magdalenian modified bone objects in order to preserve their morphology. As a result, for the bone objects, a minimally-invasive collagen sampling method was attempted which had been developed for analysis of historic parchments72, and which had previously proved successful on ca. 500 years old modified bone objects from Quebec, Canada73. The 90 unworked cetacean bone samples, and 83 modified bone objects, also underwent a destructive ZooMS protocol to achieve accurate taxonomic identifications (see results above). The bone samples were analyzed using the destructive ZooMS methods listed below, based on a modified protocol as described in Buckley et al.26.

The bone objects were gently rubbed with a clean piece of PVC eraser; collagen is transferred from the object to the eraser crumbs through the triboelectric effect72. The collected eraser crumbs from each sample were incubated for four hours at 37 °C in 75 µL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution (NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, AmBic) and 0.4 µg of trypsin. Trypsin activity was terminated using 1 µL of 5% TFA solution, and peptides were purified using C18 ZipTip® pipette tips and eluted with 50 µL of conditioning solution (50% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA). 1 µL of eluted peptides was then spotted onto a Bruker ground steel target plate, to which 1 µL of matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) was added. Each sample was spotted in triplicate along with calibration standards, and run on a Bruker Ultraflex III MALDI-ToF-MS. Triplicate spectra were averaged and analyzed using mMass software74 and compared to a database of known collagen peptide masses (Supplementary Data 3)75,76,77,78.

The minimally-invasive sampling technique proved unsuccessful for the majority of the tested samples. This was likely due to a combination of factors, including cetacean bone morphology and sample contamination. Due to the physical requirements of cetaceans, their bones often take on one of two forms depending on the element—either very dense and highly mineralized, or very porous and friable. Both bone conditions are problematic for minimally-invasive sampling methods as they result in reduced availability of surface collagen. Other studies applying the minimally-invasive eraser method also found limited success compared with destructive approaches73,79,80; as a result, a destructive and/or double extraction was performed on the samples.

Subsamples of bone or bone powder, sometimes several per specimen and ranging from 20 to 70 mg, were demineralized in 250 µL of 0.6 M HCl (4 °C). The acid was removed and samples were rinsed three times in 200 µL of 50 mM AmBic. Samples were incubated in 100 µL of AmBic for one hour at 65 °C to gelatinize the collagen; then 0.4 µg of trypsin was added to 50 µL of supernatant and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Trypsin activity was terminated using 1 µL of 5% TFA solution, and peptides were purified using C18 ZipTip® pipette tips and eluted with 50 µL of conditioning solution. MALDI-TOF-MS was conducted as described above.

Several samples analyzed using the minimally-invasive sampling method returned results that suggested sample contamination, likely as a result of a consolidant that had been added to the specimens post-excavation. This contamination particularly affected specimens from the Saint-Périer excavations (during the 1930's) at the site of Isturitz. While there is no mention in the reports for these excavations of the artifacts having been conserved with any type of consolidant, both minimally-invasive and destructive analyses of a number of these specimens consistently returned collagen identifications of cattle (Bos genus). Upon further inspection of the spectra, peptide markers that appeared to match those of various cetaceans could also be observed, however at a much lower intensity than the cattle fingerprint (Supplementary Fig. 91). This mixed signal in the collagen spectra led us to believe that consolidant contamination was a likely issue, as collagen-based glues made from cattle (and other animals) were known to have been used in conservation practices during the early 1900's.

A double extraction method was developed in an attempt to remove or reduce the signal from the contaminating consolidant (Supplementary Fig. 91)81. In this method, bone or bone powder was immersed in 250 µL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution (NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, AmBic) and placed on a shaker at room temperature for 3 h. Samples were then centrifuged briefly then incubated at 65 °C for one hour to gelatinize. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged for one minute and the AmBic was transferred to a new eppendorf as the first extraction. Subsequently, 250 µL of 0.6 M HCl (4 °C) was added to each of the original eppendorfs containing the bone chips/powder, then vortexed and left to demineralize at room temperature for four hours. The acid was removed and samples were rinsed three times in 200 µL of 50 mM AmBic. 100 µL of AmBic was then added to the samples, followed by incubation for one hour at 65 °C to gelatinize the collagen for the second extraction. Both the first and second extraction underwent digestion, purification and MALDI-TOF-MS analysis as described above. While this modified protocol resulted in lower peptide recovery, it enabled us to enhance the collagen signal from the actual ‘host' animal (in most cases, cetacean collagen peptide markers) while also confirming our suspicions regarding the use of a cattle-based consolidant (Supplementary Fig. 91).

With the exception of 7 samples (Hum-1 to Hum-18) for which collagen extraction was carried out at the EvoAdapta facility and MALDI-TOF-MS analysis at the University of York, all samples were analyzed for ZooMS at the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology (ICTA-UAB) of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona.

All glassware was cleaned using the following procedure: submerged in Decon 90 at 90 °C and cooled overnight, washed three times with DI water, submerged overnight in 10% HCl, washed three times with Milli-Q. After drying, the glassware was wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent dust contamination during storage and finally baked out in the oven at 450 °C for 5 h.

The bone collagen extraction protocol based on Longin82 followed the following steps: Bone samples were first demineralized in 0.2 M HCl for several days, with mechanical and visual checks. The acid was renewed several times during this step. The samples were then rinsed three times with Milli-Q, submerged for 20 min in 0.1 M NaOH (with new NaOH being added for another 20 min if discoloration appeared), before being rinsed again three times with Milli-Q, submerged into 0.1 M HCl for 10 min, then rinsed again three times with Milli-Q. In the next steps, the samples were gelatinized in weak (pH 3) HCl at 90 °C until dissolution, filtered with glass filter units (mesh size 10–20 μm), frozen with liquid nitrogen and lyophilized in clean (baked out) vials.

As anomalous peaks were observed in FTIR-ATR spectra of several samples, most likely indicating the presence of glue or consolidant, the XAD resin approach was applied to eliminate this type of contamination. This approach was developed by Stafford et al.83,84,85, is also described in van der Sluis et al.86. Lyophilized collagen samples were dissolved in 1 mL of (sub boiling distilled) 6 M HCl in 10 mL borosilicate tubes with PTFE lines caps before being hydrolyzed at 110 °C for 24 h. The hydrolysate was then passed through pre-conditioned XAD columns fitted with a filter frit at the bottom, filled with ±100 μl (circa 1 cm) of XAD 2 resin slurry and covered with the top filter frit. The latter was pushed down in order to remove air bubbles. The columns were then washed with 20 mL of 1 M HCl and preconditioned with 10 mL of 6 M HCl. After the sample hydrolysate had passed through, the column was washed with 1 bed volume of 6 M HCl in order to collect any amino acids in the void space and added to the collected sample. Samples were dried in small open beakers on the hotplate in the fume hood and were rinsed with Milli-Q to remove any leftover HCl by evaporation. The samples were then transferred in 200 μl (7-8 drops) of Milli-Q to combustion tubes using glass Pasteur pipettes, frozen and lyophilized.

Samples were connected to the CO2 extraction line in the radiocarbon laboratory of the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle. After adding 900 mbar pure O2, samples were combusted at 900 °C for a duration of 10 to 20 minutes in the presence of a baked out silver strip (10 mg) to remove contaminants, cleaned on the CO2 extraction line (water trap, NOx oven fitted with copper and silver fiber wool), then volume calculated. The vacuum on the line reached 10-6 mbars. The CO2 gas sample was transferred to a fully-automated H2 reduction line using iron as a catalyst, where the vacuum reached 10-7 mbars.

Samples were run alongside standards of oxalic acid and phthalic acid. Graphite targets were pressed and analyzed on the same day with the ECHo-MICADAS at the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement (LSCE) in Gif-sur-Yvette, France. Data reduction was performed using the BATS software (version 47)87. The first scans were discarded to eliminate possible contamination of the target with ambient atmosphere between target pressing and AMS measurement. Radiocarbon ages were calculated from F14C88, which is corrected for background and isotopic fractionation. Measurement parameters such as 12C current and 13CH current were monitored during 14C measurement. Time, current and isobar corrections were made before validation. For each individual run, normalization, correction for fractionation and background corrections were applied by measuring the oxalic acid II NIST standard, its 13C/12C ratio and the chemical blanks. The standard deviation of the blanks is generally less than 10% but an overestimated 30% is imposed to the blank value in order to take into account a potential variability of the contaminant which could be added during the sample preparation.

Six samples (Hum4, Hum5, Hum8, Hum9, Hum14 and Hum18) were chemically pretreated and prepared at the Higham Lab, University of Vienna, Austria. Sample pretreatment for these samples follows collagen extraction outlined in Brock et al.89. Three samples (Hum9, Hum14 and Hum18) were combusted offline, graphitized using an AGE graphitization unit, and measured at the VERA (Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator) AMS facility, University of Vienna. For details on aspects of target preparation and AMS measurement see Steier et al.90 and Golser & Kutschera91. Three other samples (Hum4, Hum5 and Hum8) were measured at the Keck AMS facility, University of California at Irvine. For details on aspects of target preparation and AMS measurement see Santos et al.92 and Beverly et al.93. These six samples have R-numbers and VERA or UCIAMS numbers instead of MUSE-numbers.

As diagenetic alteration can affect stable isotope values as well as radiocarbon ages, only results from good quality collagen with an atomic C:N ratio between 2.9 and 3.6 ought to be used94. However, studies by van Klinken95 on archeological bones and Guiry and Szpak96 on modern bones have suggested that values outside the 3.0-3.3 range for mammals may result in distorted isotopic compositions due to contamination by non-collagenous carbon. We compared the values for whale species that agree with different atomic C:N ratio ranges (2.9–3.3 and 3.3–3.6) (Supplementary Fig. 96). In these figures there is considerable overlap between samples with an atomic C:N ratio up to 3.3 and 3.6, only the gray whale samples show lower carbon stable isotope values (circa 1‰), although this could also be due to the small sample size. We believe most of the variation visible here is due to individual variation between the whales, rather than diagenetic alteration. Whales are exceptionally large (marine) mammals, thus resulting in a larger variation in stable isotope ratios in their bone collagen due to their longevity and slow bone turnover time. Samples with atomic C:N ratios between 2.9–3.6 were included in the discussion of the stable isotopes results. Additionally, stable isotope analysis was done on collagen, while 14C dating was performed on collagen after XAD resin treatment, which would have removed any, if present, remaining contamination. When examining the 14C ages against atomic C:N ratios from a single site (Santa Catalina) (Supplementary Fig. 97), there is no evidence of a correlation that might indicate contamination.

Dating of marine animals needs to take into account the marine reservoir effect: given that oceans are depleted in 14C in relation to the atmosphere, conventional radiocarbon dates for marine organisms appear older than for coeval terrestrial individuals97. Some studies use sample pairing between coeval terrestrial and marine taxa to aid interpretations of reservoir ages at archeological sites98. This was not possible in our case, because our samples are all from Pleistocene cave and rockshelter sites with complex stratigraphy (in which each excavated layer is the result of an accumulation of multiple occupation episodes) and most of our samples are from ancient excavations with poor stratigraphic resolution. We thus relied on the correction for the reservoir effect implemented for marine samples in OxCal 4.4, which is based on the Marine20 calibration curve99.

In addition, dating of marine organisms can be further refined by taking into account the fact that the marine reservoir effect varies across oceanic masses, being for example stronger (i.e., leading to seemingly older organisms) at higher latitudes and in deeper waters100. This deviation from the standard (globally averaged) marine reservoir effect is expressed as a DeltaR term. In the case of our whale specimens, however, it is not the coastal waters adjacent to the archeological sites that matter, but the water mass (or masses) where whales fed. The whale species identified in this dataset are very diverse in terms of their feeding ground locations and feeding depths. For example, previous studies estimated DeltaR values: between −168 and 504 ± 60 years for sperm whales (that feed in deep waters but can be found in either high latitudes or sub-tropical seas101); at 24 ± 58 years for bowhead whales (that forage in polar/sub-polar waters close to the sea surface102); and about 350 years for a fin whale (a species that forages at depths up to 400 meters and migrates vast distances103). Intra-specific variability in DeltaR values renders it difficult to obtain meaningful values per species. We have not found published estimates of DeltaR for gray whales, but the foraging strategy of this species (which feeds on invertebrates found in shallow sedimentary environments and migrates over very long distances) renders it particularly susceptible to intraspecific variation in DeltaR, especially as it will be dependent on the type of sediment (molluscs feeding on calcareous sediments appear over 2000 years older than suspension-feeding ones104).

In addition to these difficulties, DeltaR values published in the literature from modern (Holocene) whales need to be approached with caution when applied to Pleistocene samples. Indeed, the spatial variation in the reservoir effect of water masses likely varied over time, in response to changes in ocean circulation. The foraging grounds of whales are also likely to have been different, given that in the Late Pleistocene, the study region was substantially cooler. For these reasons, we have opted for not attempting to apply a species-specific DeltaR based on information from modern whales, and instead use a single DeltaR as suitable as possible to the period and region of our samples.

Choosing the most suitable reservoir correction required careful consideration of various parameters. Foote et al.105 used a DeltaR = 0 to correct for the reservoir effect in bowhead whales during the Pleistocene. However, this no longer seems suitable since the update of the Marine20 calibration curve, as there are large fluctuations in pre-Holocene reservoir ages97. Monge Soares et al.106 published a DeltaR = −117 ± 70 yr for the Late Pleistocene based on three samples pairs (shells and bones/charred wood) from the Cantabrian coast. Mangerud et al.107 showed that there is little difference between the DeltaR from whales and mollusks found at the same location. However, since the update of the Marine20 calibration curve, the DeltaR from Monge Soares et al. needs updating as well. Monge Soares et al. used three paired 14C ages for the calculation of their Late Pleistocene DeltaR (terrestrial 14C ages: 15 656 ± 75, 19 710 ± 120 and 23 040 ± 50 yr BP). Considering the ages of our samples, we decided it would be most suitable to use the two youngest paired 14C ages for an updated DeltaR, because the third sample pair was considerably older. These two paired Late Pleistocene 14C dates from Monge Soares et al. were used in the online application108 to calculate updated DeltaR values. These new DeltaR values are statistically the same (0.037 (χ2:0.05 = 3.84)). The weighted mean of these DeltaR and standard deviation are calculated according to: http://calib.org/marine/AverageDeltaR.html, which gives a new Delta R of -448 ± 39 yr. The calibration was done in OxCal 4.4 (Supplementary Figs. 92 through 95, and Supplementary Code 1)99.

Additionally, using all North Atlantic whales (various species) in the Marine Reservoir Correction Database we get a DeltaR of −168 ± 53, compared with the DeltaR of −117 ± 70 from Monge Soares et al. for the Holocene. This means that the latter slightly overestimate the reservoir age, making samples slightly younger. This may not be the case for the Late Pleistocene samples but it does strengthen our idea that the material used for paired dating in this region by Monge Soares et al. is not that far off from whales themselves. However, the DeltaR used here is not optimal for two species in this dataset, namely sperm whales due to their large variation in ΔR (between –168 and 504 ( ± 60) 14C yr101) and gray whales due to feeding in shallow waters where they might ingest calcareous sediment with different 14C ages104.

Heaton et al.100 propose a specific calibration of marine samples from polar regions, essentially calculating a range between a minimum and maximum DeltaR. The minimum is based on the Marine20 curve and the maximum is based on the latitude of the sample and the Large Scale Geostrophic Ocean General Circulation Model (LSG OGCM), which is suggested to use for samples from outside ∼40°S–40°N during glacial periods. Our samples are found between of 43–44 °N, although the whales could of course have been feeding at higher latitudes. However, we do not have the exact location.

We state that our results provide evidence of whale bone working from 20ka BP, which is based on two fin whales. If the absolute max DeltaR would be applied, these 2 fin whales would be between 2000-1500-1000 years younger (Fig. 3 in Heaton et al.100, although there is a substantial variation between 71 °N, 88 °N and 53 degrees °N, and again we do not know where these animals were feeding). It would be more realistic to assume sea ice most likely covered a large part of the North Atlantic waters, extending much further south than it does today. If so, most whales would not have been feeding too far north due to sea ice coverage (unlikely reaching the 71 and 88 °N, except for beluga's and bowheads). Additionally, modern fin whales feed in various locations, have summer and winter feeding grounds, and can also adapt their feeding strategy to minimize interspecific competition, suggesting that the maximum value would not be a realistic assumption. Combining all of these assumptions, it is plausible that the maximum DeltaR was ~800 yr, although its value remains extremely uncertain.

Given that the results we present here reconstruct the chronology of whale acquisition using very broad time slices of 1.5 millennia (Fig. 2), it is unlikely that our conclusions are significantly affected by an uncertainty on DeltaR in the range of a few centuries. It does however mean that caution is needed when interpreting individual radiocarbon dating results. These can be improved in the future as more information becomes available regarding suitable corrections for the marine reservoir effect.

Bone collagen samples (320–380 μg) were weighed into tin capsules (5 × 8 mm) and analyzed with a Thermo Scientific EA Flash 2000 coupled to a Delta V Advantage isotopic mass spectrometer in the Service de Spectrométrie de Masse Isotopique (SSMIM) in the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris, France. Isotopic values of all samples were measured relative to the laboratory standard alanine, which has a reproducibility of 0.3 wt% for N and 0.6 wt% for C. The δ13C and δ15N values are reported relative to the VPDB and AIR, respectively. Three primary standards were used to calibrate the Alanine for δ15N air: IAEA USGS-25 (ammonium sulfate), IAEA N1 (ammonium sulfate) and IAEA N2 (ammonium sulfate), while one primary standard (from IAEA) was used to calibrate the Alanine for δ13C V-PDB: IAEA 600 (caffeine). Analytical precision is ± 0.2‰ for both δ13C and δ15N values. Five samples were run in duplicate and the difference fell between 0-0.3‰ for δ13C ratios, and 0–0.34‰ for δ15N ratios.

Subsamples (0.2–0.3 mg) of extracted bone collagen from six samples (Hum4, Hum5, Hum8, Hum9, Hum14 and Hum18) were taken for the analysis of isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen by elemental analyzer-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA-IRMS; Thermo Scientific EA-Isolink with a Flash 2000 coupled to a Delta V Advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer) in the Silver Laboratory (Large-Instrument Facility for Advanced Isotope Research) at the Center of Microbiology and Environmental Systems Science of the University of Vienna. Stable isotope values of all samples are measured relative to the laboratory standard alanine, which has a reproducibility of 0.07 wt% for N and 0.1 wt% for C. δ13C and δ15N values are reported relative to the VPDB and AIR standard, respectively, and are measured with an analytical precision of ± 0.1‰ for both δ13C and δ15N values. Acceptable stable isotope ratios have an atomic C:N ratio that falls between 2.9–3.694.

The difference in δ13C ratios between the balaenidae, fin and gray whales suggests these whales were feeding in different bodies of water, which in turn may have affected their radiocarbon ages. To investigate this, we plotted the conventional 14C age against the δ13C ratio from these whale bones (Supplementary Fig. 98). We found no correlation between these two variables (R2 = 8 × 10−5). The ages of the three whale groups studied broadly overlap: balaenidae (right/bowhead whales; n = 8) are dated from 16–16.5ka to 17.1–17.8ka cal BP; fin whales (n = 31) are dated from 13.2–13.5ka to 19.5–20ka cal BP; gray whales (n = 4) are dated from 16.3–16.9ka to 17.4–18ka cal BP.

To absorb nutrients and support commensal microbes, the host induces tolerogenic immune responses via peripheral regulatory T cells (pTregs) 1,2. Prior studies identified type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1) as initiators of dietary pTregs3. However, we now report that food-specific pTreg cells are exclusively induced by the recently identified RORγt APCs4–8 and not by cDCs. Instead, our data suggest that pTreg–cDC1 interactions in steady-state limit the expansion of food-specific CD8αβ T cells. This regulation breaks during infection or food poisoning, enabling dietary CD8αβ T cells to expand and acquire effector functions in response to mimicked food antigens. Unlike in typical infections, after the pathogen is cleared, dietary CD8αβ T cells do not expand in response to their corresponding dietary antigens. Thus, we propose that in response to dietary antigens, tolerance is mediated by a circuit of dedicated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T cells. When the host is challenged by infection, this circuit permits the transient expansion of protective effector responses without compromising the overall strategy of tolerance that ensures safe food consumption.

Metrics details

Microglia play a key role in the response to amyloid beta in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this context, the major transcriptional response of microglia is the upregulation of APOE, the strongest late-onset AD risk gene. Of its three isoforms, APOE2 is thought to be protective, while APOE4 increases AD risk. We hypothesised that the isoforms change gene regulatory patterns that link back to biological function by shaping microglial transcriptomic and chromatin landscapes. We use RNA- and ATAC-sequencing to profile gene expression and chromatin accessibility of human microglia xenotransplantated into the brains of male APPNL-G-F mice. We identify widespread transcriptomic and epigenomic differences which are dependent on APOE genotype and are corroborated across the profiling assays. Our results indicate that impaired microglial proliferation, migration and immune responses may contribute to the increased risk for late-onset AD in APOE4 carriers, while increased phagocytic capabilities and DNA-binding of the vitamin D receptor in APOE2 microglia may contribute to the isoform's protective role.

Microglia are key players implicated in the genetic susceptibility and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD genetic risk predominantly falls within regulatory regions of the genome, including those marked by H3K27ac1, an epigenetic modification found at active enhancers and promoters2. H3K27ac is dysregulated in the brains of individuals with AD3,4, and microglial H3K27ac regions are strongly enriched for AD genetic risk5,6. Microglia have also been associated with AD risk in their open chromatin regions7,8,9,10, and at the level of their transcriptome11,12,13. Recent research using single-cell transcriptomics has highlighted that microglia occur in various distinct subtypes and activation states, which are anticipated to exhibit different epigenomic and transcriptomic responses dependent on their environmental niche. This variation is expected to give rise to different downstream effects on AD pathogenesis. Supporting this is the continued characterisation of different microglial phenotypes in AD, including those responsive to amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregates, a pathological hallmark of AD14,15,16.

In mouse models, the strongest transcriptional response of microglia to Aβ aggregates is the upregulation of the gene APOE14,17,18, which harbours the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. APOE is involved in regulating cholesterol and other lipid transport across cells19. In the periphery, it is produced by macrophages in the liver, while in the brain, it is primarily produced by astrocytes19. In humans, APOE has uniquely evolved into three different isoforms encoded by the alleles: APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4. In AD, APOE2 is thought to be protective, while APOE4 increases disease risk up to 12-fold in homozygous individuals of certain human populations20. Several studies have begun to explore the role of microglial APOE in AD, using different samples and methodologies. In mouse models of AD, mice expressing the APOE4 isoform exhibit a higher abundance of microglia stress and inflammatory markers, a phenotype also observed in human tissue15. Furthermore, APOE4 microglia are linked to dysregulated lipid metabolism21,22, followed by tau phosphorylation22. Regarding immune responses, APOE4 microglia induce the signalling of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), a multifunctional cytokine23. Clearly, APOE plays a critical role in regulating microglia in response to AD pathology. Thus far, studies have predominantly focused on APOE4, but it is equally important to determine the role of APOE2, which may potentially be antagonistic. We hypothesised that different APOE isoforms would differentially regulate the microglial phenotype in response to Aβ pathology. However, the unique evolution of APOE in humans makes it difficult to faithfully recapitulate its effects on AD risk and pathogenesis in mouse models. As previously suggested, investigating the microglial response in human tissue is challenging due to technical limitations and inconsistencies in biological findings24.

To tackle these challenges, researchers have developed a human microglia xenotransplantation model25,26, in which iPSC-derived human microglia are xenografted into the brains of mice. Single-cell profiling of these microglia has identified known and novel amyloid-responsive states27. These microglial states were enriched for different subsets of AD genetic risk genes, highlighting that multiple microglial states are influenced by AD genetic susceptibility. In addition, shift into what is thought to be a protective and human-specific microglial state was impaired in APOE4 microglia16. In addition to demonstrating the usefulness of this model in disentangling the microglial response to Aβ pathology, this highlights the need to investigate the functional role of AD genetic risk factors in a cell type-specific manner.

Here, we used ATAC-seq and RNA-seq to profile human microglia expressing the different APOE isoforms, which were xenotransplanted into the AppNL-G-F mouse model of AD. This enabled us to delineate the effects of the different APOE isoforms on the epigenomic and transcriptomic landscapes of microglia in AD.

We transplanted iPSC-derived human microglia APOE2/0, APOE3/0, APOE4/0 and an APOE knockout (APOE-KO) into the brains of the AppNL-G-F mouse model of Alzheimer's disease28. At 12 months, by which point Aβ pathology is extensive18,28, microglia were isolated by FACS using human microglia-specific antibodies (CD11b + hCD45+, Fig. 1a). This approach results in a scenario where the manipulations of the APOE genotype are restricted to microglia, thereby allowing us to study microglia-autonomous effects of the isoforms. To characterise the epigenomic and transcriptomic landscapes of these microglia, they were profiled using ATAC-seq for open chromatin and RNA-seq for gene expression, respectively. After quality control and pre-processing, we obtained high-quality chromatin accessibility data across 16 mice (APOE2 = 5, APOE3 = 5, APOE4 = 4, APOE-KO = 2; Supplementary Data 1, Supplementary Fig. 1) and high-quality transcriptomic data across 17 mice (APOE2 = 5, APOE3 = 4, APOE4 = 5, APOE-KO = 3; Supplementary Data 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). Overall, we observed widespread differences in gene expression and chromatin accessibility across microglia of the different APOE isoforms, highlighting the complexity of the microglial response to Aβ pathology. In support of the opposing roles of APOE2 and APOE4 in AD risk, the greatest differences were observed between these isoforms.

APOE expression was significantly lower in three out of five knockout samples (Supplementary Fig. 2), and only these were used in downstream analyses (Fig. 1b). Additionally, APOE expression was lower in the APOE4 microglia compared to APOE2 and APOE3. This is in agreement with previous studies investigating the APOE alleles in microglia and astrocytes29,30. Chromatin accessibility around the transcriptional start site (TSS) of APOE was consistent across the APOE groups (Fig. 1c). As the most commonly expressed allele20, we used APOE3 as the baseline for pairwise comparisons in the differential expression and chromatin accessibility analyses performed using DESeq231. In addition, we compared the microglia expressing APOE4 with those expressing APOE2. When compared to APOE3 microglia, differential expression analysis revealed 470 (282 up, 188 down, (FDR < 0.05); Figs. 1d, 2a, Supplementary Data 2) and 332 (170 up, 158 down, (FDR < 0.05); Figs. 1d, 2b, Supplementary Data 2) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in APOE2 and APOE4, respectively. As expected, given their postulated opposing roles in AD risk, the direct comparison of APOE4 with APOE2 revealed the most differences, with 1639 DEGs (751 up, 888 down, (FDR < 0.05; Figs. 1d, 2c, Supplementary Data 2). 126 genes were upregulated and 206 were downregulated in the APOE-KO when compared with the APOE3 isoform (Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Data 2).

Comparison with the APOE-KO enabled us to infer whether the transcriptional mechanisms underlying APOE2 and APOE4 microglia can be explained by loss and/or gain of function. We used Rank-Rank Hypergeometric Overlap (RRHO) to quantify the degree of overlap between expression signatures in the APOE-KO vs APOE3 and APOE2 vs APOE3, and the APOE-KO vs APOE3 and APOE4 vs APOE3. We observed significant overlap between expression patterns in the APOE-KO and APOE2 comparison (Spearman's rank correlation, rho = 0.55, p < 2.2e−16; Fig. 2d), as well as for the APOE-KO and APOE4 variants (Spearman's rank correlation, rho = 0.34, p < 2.2e−16; Fig. 2e). The strongest overlap was seen for genes downregulated in both APOE2 and APOE4, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying the different APOE isoforms can be in part explained by a loss of APOE function. However, there were also unique transcriptional changes occurring in APOE2 and APOE4 microglia (Fig. 2d, e). This corroborates findings reported by Machlovi et al.32 in which the authors performed similar analyses investigating the APOE4 and APOE3 isoforms in mouse microglia. To further explore the overlaps with the APOE-KO, we correlated the genes that had similar expression profiles in APOE2 and the APOE-KO, and APOE4 and the APOE-KO, when compared to the APOE3 allele. All genes that had the same direction of expression change in APOE2 and the APOE-KO, also had the same direction of expression change in APOE4, when compared with APOE3 (Fig. 2f). A few genes were only significant in either APOE2 or APOE4, including TSPAN13, which was upregulated in APOE4 microglia and is associated with lipid accumulation in microglia22,33. Due to the pleiotropic nature of APOE, we evaluated whether genes differentially expressed across the APOE groups exhibited differential enrichment for AD genetic risk variants. Using MAGMA gene set analysis34, we found that genes downregulated in the APOE4 and APOE-KO microglia were enriched for risk variants identified in one AD GWAS35 (FDR < 0.05; Fig. 2g, Supplementary Data 3). This supports previous evidence suggesting that the mechanisms of APOE4 reflect a loss-of-function in the context of AD16,23,36, with APOE4 affecting biological pathways that are consistent with those linked to the polygenic component of AD.

To evaluate the upstream regulatory mechanisms associated with the transcriptomic changes across the APOE isoforms, we next investigated changes in chromatin accessibility. When compared to APOE3 microglia, APOE2 microglia had 40 differentially accessible regions (DARs) (24 up, 16 down, FDR < 0.05; Fig. 3a, Supplementary Data 4), APOE4 microglia had 50 DARs (38 up, 12 down, FDR < 0.05; Fig. 3b, Supplementary Data 4). Again, the direct comparison of APOE4 with APOE2 revealed the most differences, with 72 DARs (52 up, 20 down, FDR < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. 4a, Supplementary Data 4), with the fewest changes observed in the KO (14 up, 8 down, FDR < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. 4b). Notably, our analysis revealed consistent epigenomic and transcriptomic responses across microglia expressing the different APOE isoforms (Supplementary Fig. 5). For instance, CHCHD2, a mitochondrial gene involved in promoting cellular migration37 and implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD)38,39, was significantly downregulated in APOE4 microglia when compared to both APOE3 (logFC = –7.8, p = 1.3e−11; Figs. 2b, 3c, Supplementary Data 2) and APOE2 (logFC = –7.4, p = 7.8e−11; Figs. 2c, 3c, Supplementary Data 2). In parallel, chromatin accessibility was significantly reduced close to the TSS of this gene when compared to APOE3 (logFC = −7.8, p = 1.2e−7, distance to TSS = 0; Fig. 3b, d, Supplementary Data 4) and APOE2 (logFC = −6.5, p = 8.3e−9, distance to TSS = 0; Supplementary Fig. 4a, Supplementary Data 4). Expression of this gene was also significantly reduced in the APOE-KO, suggesting a potential loss of protective function via this gene in the APOE4 microglia (Supplementary Fig. 3). Similarly, the zinc finger protein ZNF248 was upregulated in APOE4 microglia (APOE4 vs APOE3, logFC = 9, p = 5.1e−14; APOE4 vs APOE2, logFC = 7.9, p = 5.2e−19; Supplementary Data 2) and genomic regions in the vicinity of this gene had increased chromatin accessibility (APOE4 vs APOE3, logFC = 6.3, p = 2.3e−5; APOE4 vs APOE2, logFC = 6.6, p = 3.2e−5; Supplementary Data 4). Interestingly, in an in vitro study investigating functional and transcriptional phenotypes of a TREM2 mutant and knockout in iPSC-derived microglia-like cells, ZNF248 was upregulated in the TREM2-KO, while CHCHD2 expression was reduced in the R47H mutant40. For an overall assessment of the concordance between ATAC-seq and RNA-seq, we correlated the logFC values between DEGs and DARs at the corresponding promoter peaks. We observed a strong correlation across all APOE comparisons, indicating general concordance between changes in chromatin and gene expression (Supplementary Fig. 6). Microglia-specific regulatory regions originating from human samples are strongly enriched for AD genetic risk5,6,10,41. To evaluate whether human iPSC-derived microglia xenotransplanted into the mouse brain would recapitulate this enrichment we used stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression (s-LDSC)42 with AD GWAS43. We found that open chromatin regions from the xenotransplanted microglia were enriched for AD heritability (FDR < 0.05, Fig. 3e, Supplementary Data 5). As the xenotransplanted microglia are predominantly responding to Aβ in our model, this enrichment also suggests that a significant proportion of AD risk is associated with microglial reactions to this pathological hallmark44. By repeating the analysis using GWAS data for autism spectrum disorder45 and amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)46, we confirmed that this enrichment was specific to AD, and not a general brain disease enrichment (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Data 5).

Human microglia from the xenotransplantation model used here were previously profiled using single-cell RNA sequencing27. Mancuso et al. (2024) report eight microglial states responsive to Aβ pathology, including previously characterised disease-associated microglia (DAM), as well as novel states annotated as cytokine response (CRM) and antigen-presenting response (HLA) microglia. Using hypergeometric testing, we found that genes dysregulated across the microglia with different APOE isoforms were strongly enriched within several microglia clusters (Fig. 4a): The strongest association was observed for genes downregulated in APOE4 microglia, which were enriched in the HLA, ribosomal microglia (RM), and DAM clusters (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, genes downregulated in APOE4 microglia were enriched in the DAM cluster associated with negative regulation of tumour necrosis (TNF) cytokine production (Fig. 4b). Since negative regulation of cytokine production refers to processes that inhibit cytokine production, the downregulation of these genes in APOE4 microglia suggests increased cytokine production in this isoform, which was confirmed in the gene expression data (Fig. 4c–f). CRM microglia mount a pro-inflammatory response driven by the upregulation of chemokines and cytokines, and have only been characterised in human16. Mancuso and colleagues16 showed that in response to Aβ, APOE4 microglia shift to the CRM state rather than HLA. In agreement, Machlovi et al. (2022) report increased cytokine production in APOE4 microglia. Conversely, where the authors found increased TNFα in APOE4 microglia, TNF family members, including TNFRSF25 and TNFRSF21, were upregulated in APOE2 microglia in our study. Taken together with the decreased HLA and DAM response in APOE4 microglia here, these findings suggest that APOE4 microglia fail to transition towards microglial states that are thought to be protective14,16 (Fig. 4a).

We used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)47 to identify microglial gene modules with similar expression profiles (Fig. 5a). These modules were then tested for differential expression across the APOE groups, and the differentially expressed modules were functionally characterised using pathway enrichment analysis. We identified two differentially expressed modules significantly associated with GO biological processes. First, a gene module upregulated in APOE2 microglia when compared to both APOE3 and APOE4 was associated with proliferation and cellular migration pathways (Fig. 5b, c, Supplementary Data 6). Such pathways are likely important for microglia being recruited towards the site of Aβ pathology and initiating its clearance, which in some cases, requires APOE48. Second, a module upregulated in APOE2 when compared to APOE4 was significantly associated with a range of immune responses, including both innate immune responses such as complement activation, and adaptive immune responses such as antibody-mediated immunity (Fig. 5d, e, Supplementary Data 6).

Previous studies have linked the APOE2 isoform to enhanced phagocytic capabilities49,50,51. Using a recently generated scRNA-seq dataset from phagocytic microglia associated with Aβ plaques52, genes upregulated in APOE2-expressing microglia when compared to both APOE3 and APOE4, were exclusively overrepresented in a set of genes upregulated in phagocytic microglia (Fig. 6a). To functionally validate this finding, we performed phagocytosis assays using iPSC-derived human microglia using pHrodo E. coli particles and fluorescent myelin. As hypothesised, APOE2-expressing microglia internalised significantly higher amounts of pHrodo E. coli compared to all other APOE groups (Fig. 6b, c, Supplementary Fig. 7). Additionally, a significantly higher proportion of APOE2-expressing microglia successfully took up myelin compared to APOE4-expressing microglia (Fig. 6d, e), as reported previously51. We also observed that APOE-KO microglia displayed very high amounts of intracellular myelin. This could indicate an impairment to digest the phagocytosed material, and is in line with previous studies showing lipid accumulation in ApoE−/− mouse microglia in models of demyelination53. Overall, the enrichment of proliferation, migration, phagocytosis, and immune responses suggests enhanced microglial function in APOE2.

To better understand the regulatory machinery of human microglia in Alzheimer's disease and the upstream orchestrators of altered transcriptional states, we performed de novo motif enrichment analysis using HOMER54 on the open chromatin regions from the xenotransplanted microglia. Specifically, we used the top 100 peaks with increased and decreased chromatin accessibility across the APOE isoforms as input and defined all ATAC-seq peaks as the background set. Regions with increased accessibility in the APOE2 microglia were strongly enriched for the DNA binding motif of the vitamin D receptor (VDR; Fig. 7a), a ligand-inducible transcription factor (TF) and main mediator of vitamin D signalling55. Importantly, vitamin D deficiency has been linked to increased risk for AD56,57. We next assessed whether VDR target genes were upregulated in APOE2 microglia. A hypergeometric test confirmed an overrepresentation of genes upregulated in APOE2 when compared to both APOE3 and APOE4 (Fig. 7b), in a list of monocytic VDR target genes identified in a previous study58. This confirms the expected downstream transcriptional response predicted by increased VDR binding in APOE2 microglia. Activation of an anti-inflammatory microglia phenotype via IL-10 and vitamin D signalling has been reported previously59 (Fig. 7c). Consistent with this, in our data, the alpha subunit of the IL-10 receptor (IL-10RA) was significantly upregulated in APOE2 microglia (Fig. 7d). We also checked to see whether VDR target genes were associated with any of the WGCNA modules identified in this study (Supplementary Fig. 8). The ME1 (dark green) module was enriched for upregulated VDR target genes, and this module was also identified as upregulated in APOE2-expressing microglia. The ME1 module was characterised by biological pathways associated with immune responses (Fig. 5d, e). The ME2 (blue) module was also enriched for upregulated VDR target genes, however, this module was not differentially expressed across the APOE groups (FDR < 0.05). Aside from the VDR enrichment, regions with increased chromatin accessibility in APOE4-expressing microglia when compared to APOE2 were enriched for STAT2, a TF involved in interferon response signalling60. De novo motif enrichment analysis results for all APOE isoform comparisons can be found in Supplementary Data 7.

Increasing evidence points to a highly complex response of microglia to AD pathology. Here, we show that the human APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4 differentially regulate microglia in the context of Aβ aggregates. By profiling human microglia isolated from a xenotransplantation model of AD using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, we uncovered widespread changes to the transcriptomic and chromatin landscape of this cell type, dependent on the APOE isoform expressed. As anticipated, the largest differences were observed when comparing the AD risk opposing APOE2 and APOE4 microglia.

First, we observed consistent epigenomic and transcriptomic responses for several genes, including CHCHD2 and ZNF248. CHCHD2 is involved in promoting cell migration37 and has been linked to familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD)38, where it is transcriptionally downregulated. Its decreased expression and chromatin accessibility in APOE4 microglia, but also in the knockout, suggest a loss of normal function. Conversely, ZNF248 was upregulated in APOE4 and the knockout in both assays, suggesting a potential gain of toxic function. In a study comparing the effects of TREM2 knockout and a TREM2 mutation in a model of human microglia, the TREM2 knockout had deficits in phagocytosis, chemotaxis, and survival that were not observed in the TREM2 mutant40. ZNF248 was one of only four differentially expressed genes with reduced expression in the knockout but increased expression in the mutant. Although the authors argue that it is unlikely that such a limited number of genes, including ZNF248, could explain such vast phenotypic differences40, the overlap between APOE4 microglia and TREM2 knockout microglia is interesting. The convergence of results between the DEGs and DARs highlights the robustness of using multiple independent assays to profile cellular states in a disease context. Overlapping expression signatures with the APOE knockout enabled us to infer whether the APOE2 and APOE4 alleles resulted in a loss or gain-of-function. Although both alleles overlapped with the knockout, only genes downregulated in APOE4 microglia and the knockout were both enriched for AD genetic risk, lending support to previous reports of APOE4 microglia increasing AD risk through loss-of-function mechanisms16,23. Further investigation into the genes shared between the knockout and APOE4 microglia highlighted a strong upregulation of TSPAN13. This gene is also upregulated in microglia that accumulate damaging lipid droplets in the ageing brain33, and in microglia homozygous for APOE4, in response to Aβ22. Our data suggest that lipid dysregulation in APOE4 microglia may be driven by a loss of function.

Genes downregulated in APOE4 were enriched within distinct microglial states identified in response to Aβ: HLA, RM, and DAM27. HLA represents a novel, human-specific microglial state that has a pronounced response to Aβ pathology and is thought to play a protective role27. RM are enriched for ribosomal genes. In murine AD models, stage 2 DAM cells, which signal the full activation of the DAM programme that is thought to be protective, are enriched for ribosomal genes14. When considered collectively, these enrichments suggest that APOE4 microglia fail to shift into protective states. Furthermore, our analyses point toward diminished migratory capacity in APOE4 and enhanced migratory capacity in APOE2 microglia. This is supported in previous studies which have shown that migration is decreased in APOE4 microglia-like cells61, APOE4 microglia have reduced motility and responsiveness to ATP, a chemotactic cue of neuronal damage, and amyloid beta62. In contrast, genes associated with microglial migration are upregulated in APOE2 microglia51. Previously, APOE4 microglia were shown to downregulate their expression of cellular migration genes in response to demyelination51, and pericytes derived from APOE4 carriers exhibited downregulation of genes associated with cellular migration63. This also suggests that migratory capacity is not a cell type or pathology-specific mechanism affected by APOE in AD. In concordance with signatures of cellular migration, APOE2-expressing microglia also exhibited enhanced phagocytic activity when compared to APOE3 and APOE4 microglia. This observation is in agreement with previous studies which report a lower accumulation of myelin debris in APOE2-TR mice51, and increased clearance of Aβ from the interstitial fluid of mice expressing the APOE2 isoform50 In addition, APOE2-expressing macrophages derived from transgenic mice with an APP mutation were also more efficient at degrading amyloid beta than both APOE3 and APOE4-expressing macrophages49.

Another mechanism through which APOE4 may be exerting its pathogenic role in AD is by mounting a cytokine response. In other studies, mouse microglia expressing the humanised APOE4 allele increased cytokine production32, and xenotransplanted human microglia shifted towards a pro-inflammatory state27. Similarly, we report a general upregulation of cytokines in APOE4 when compared to both APOE2 and APOE3 microglia. One exception was CXCL16, which was upregulated in the APOE2 microglia. However, this chemokine has been reported to drive microglia to an anti-inflammatory phenotype in brain tumours64. In addition to changes to cytokine expression, regions with increased chromatin accessibility in APOE4-expressing microglia were enriched for STAT2, a TF involved in interferon response signalling. Increased interferon signalling as well as upregulation of associated genes has already been shown in mouse microglia expressing APOE432. Machlovi et al. (2022) also reported increased TNFα expression in APOE4 microglia, while we observed the opposite—nine TNF family genes were increased in APOE2 when compared to APOE4 (Supplementary Data 1). Whether a cytokine is pro-inflammatory is context dependent, and it is therefore difficult to conclude whether the upregulation of these TNF family genes is driving a pro-inflammatory response. In addition, it remains unclear to what extent pro-inflammatory responses are protective versus pathogenic in AD, and what triggers the increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the APOE isoforms. For instance, in APOE2 microglia the upregulation of TNF family genes may be triggered by their migration towards and interaction with Aβ plaques. Whereas in APOE4 microglia, the increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines could be due to a lack of response to Aβ, which in turn would result in continued Aβ deposition and a sustained pro-inflammatory response.

Several studies have shown an enrichment of AD genetic risk within microglia-specific genes and regulatory regions from the human brain5,6,11. Here, using the chromatin accessibility profiles from the xenotransplanted microglia we recapitulate this enrichment, highlighting the robustness of this model for investigating human genetic risk in a disease context. At the level of the transcriptome, AD genetic risk was enriched within genes downregulated in APOE4 microglia but also the APOE knockout. Supporting previous studies, this overlap suggests that AD risk increased by the presence of APOE4 is partially mediated through loss of protective function. Our findings underscore the need to consider the interplay between genetic risk factors and microglial states in AD.

In addition to arguing for increased proliferation, migration, phagocytosis and immune response in APOE2 microglia as underlying this isoform's protective effect, we report a potential upstream regulatory role for the VDR. In the context of AD, low levels of vitamin D have been associated with a higher incidence of the disease56,57, and vitamin D supplementation has been shown to improve disease outcomes65,66. It's important to take into consideration APOE genotype, as some studies have shown that APOE4 carriers have higher vitamin D levels67,68 and therefore vitamin D supplementation may be more beneficial to non-carriers66. Vitamin D acts via binding to VDR, and enrichment of VDR in regions with increased chromatin accessibility in APOE2 may therefore enable these microglia to be more responsive to vitamin D, regardless of serum levels. Furthermore, the increased expression of the IL-10RA in APOE2 microglia was particularly interesting. Vitamin D, via the VDR, increases the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1059. IL-10 then activates SOCS3 via the IL-10 receptor, and this mechanism suppresses the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Several other studies have also demonstrated an association between vitamin D and the expression of anti-inflammatory factors in microglia69,70,71,72,73,74. The functional role of VDR activation and binding warrants further studies in terms of mechanisms and therapeutic exploration.

Our study has a number of limitations. First, microglia exist in different subtypes and states. For example, microglia associated with Aβ plaques may have distinct transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles compared to less responsive microglia. While it is worth considering the contributions of APOE from mouse microglia and astrocytes, these should remain consistent across the APOE groups and, as such, should not affect differential expression and chromatin accessibility analyses. Although transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling provide valuable insights into gene regulatory mechanisms, other factors, such as histone modifications, also play a significant role in AD3,4,41. It is also worth considering that the APOE isoforms might exert risk or protection prior to the onset of Aβ pathogenesis. Future studies could adopt a time-series approach to investigate this. We linked regions with differential chromatin accessibility to differentially expressed genes based on their proximity. While this approach may capture promoter-gene relationships, many DARs may also function as enhancers. These enhancer-gene links can regulate target genes up to a megabase away, making them more challenging to identify. Using appropriate chromatin interaction data such as Hi-C could help disentangle these connections. Finally, while the absence of an adaptive immune system is necessary to prevent xenograft rejection, it may lead to unaccounted for changes in the microglial response75.

Our work sheds light on the regulation of microglia in AD: we show that it is dependent on APOE isoform, at both the level of the transcriptome and epigenome, further highlighting the complexity of this cell type in response to Aβ. Our work suggests that APOE4 microglia have compromised microglial functions including diminished migratory capacity and heightened pro-inflammatory responses compared to APOE2, and these may underlie the increased risk of AD seen in carriers of this isoform. Furthermore, our findings underscore the importance of considering the interplay between genetic risk factors, such as APOE, and microglial states in disease progression. Importantly, we highlight the potential involvement of the VDR in modulating microglial responses, providing new avenues for therapeutic exploration. Overall, the use of the microglia xenotransplantation model coupled with genome-wide profiling has enabled us to dissect the regulatory landscape of microglia expressing the different APOE isoforms. In future, this approach could be extended to other relevant genes. In summary, our study emphasises the complex interplay between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors in shaping microglial responses in AD and underscores the need for targeted interventions based on APOE genotype.

BIONi010-C-2 (APOE e3/KO), BIONi010-C-3 (APOE KO/KO), BIONi010-C-4 (APOE e4/KO), BIONi010-C-6 (APOE e2/KO) were differentiated into microglial precursors using the MIGRATE protocol, described in detail in Fattorelli et al. (2021)26. The lines were obtained via Bioneer from the European Bank for induced pluripotent Stem Cells (EBiSC), where all originating tissue donors give fully informed consent for donation, generation of iPSCs and sharing of lines for research. This set of APOE isogenic cell lines is based on the male iPSC cell line BIONi010-C. Stem cells were cultured on Matrigel in E8 Flex medium, dissociated at ~70–80% confluence, and aggregated in U-bottom 96-well plates with BMP4, VEGF, and SCF. Embryoid bodies were then transferred to six-well plates and cultured in X-VIVO medium with additional cytokines, followed by a media switch on day 11. By day 18, microglial precursors were harvested and transplanted into P4 mouse brains after depleting endogenous microglia with CSF1R inhibitor BLZ945. Ethics approval for transplantation of human iPS cells was obtained by the Ethics Committee Research UZ / KU Leuven (study S65730).

AppNL-G-F mice were crossed with homozygous Rag2tm1.1Flv Csf1tm1(CSF1)Flv Il2rgtm1.1Flv Apptm3.1Tcs mice (Jacksons Lab, strain 017708) to generate the Rag2-/- Il2rγ-/- hCSF1KI AppNL-G-F used in this study. The strain was maintained on the original C57Bl/6xBalbC background. In total, we transplanted 500,000 cells bilaterally across 20 mice. Male mice were used for the xenotransplantations to limit biological variability. Mice had access to food and water ad libitum and were housed with a 14/10 h light-dark cycle at 21 °C in groups of two to five animals. Animal experiments were approved by the local Ethical Committee of Laboratory Animals of the KU Leuven (government licence LA1210579 ECD project number P177/2017) following local and EU guidelines. Five biological replicates were prepared per experimental group: APOE2, APOE3, APOE4, APOE KO. Animals were anaesthetised with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with ice cold PBS. Samples were obtained in the morning between 9 and 11 am. From each sample at 12 months, FACS purification of the following cell numbers were attained: 100,000 cells for ATAC-seq, 200,000 cells for RNA-seq. The FACS plots with the gating strategy can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 9. ATAC-seq samples were processed immediately after cell collection for tagmentation and elution of transposed DNA (details in ATAC-seq methods section). RNA-seq was conducted from cell pellets snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.

From snap frozen cell pellets of 200,000 cells per sample, RNA was extracted using the Monarch Total RNA Miniprep Kit (T2010) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA-seq was conducted using the rRNA depletion strategy rather than mRNA enrichment so that noncoding RNAs could be recovered76. rRNA depletion was performed using NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit v2 Human/Mouse/Rat with RNA Sample Purification Beads (E7405), followed by stranded (directional) library preparation using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (E7765) following manufacturer's protocols without adjustments. RNA quality was checked using the Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (5067-1513) and final libraries were assessed using Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit (5067-2646) where all libraries were appropriate for sequencing apart from one replicate of the APOE3 microglia—therefore this isoform only has four biological replicates for RNA-seq.

ATAC-seq was conducted as previously described77. Following FACS collection of 100,000 cells per sample, cells were spun down at 500 g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed. Cell pellets were gently resuspended in 50 µL of ice cold Lysis Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630). 2.5 µL Tagment DNA Enzyme (Illumina; 20034197) was added directly and gently mixed by pipetting. The transposition reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, then transferred to ice. DNA was purified immediately with the Zymo ChIP DNA Clean and Concentration Kit (D5205) following manufacturer's instructions. The DNA column was spun dry prior to elution of transposed DNA, which was conducted with 11 µL Elution Buffer. Purified DNA was stored at -20 °C until library preparation. 10 µL DNA per sample was transferred into a PCR tube and 34.25 µL PCR master mix was added per sample. 6.25 µL of 10 µM Nextera Primer 2 (with barcode) was added per sample, where a different barcode was used for each sample to enable multiplexing. PCR was conducted using the following settings: (1) 72 °C for 5 min, (2) 98 °C for 30 s; (3) 98 °C for 10 s; (4) 63 °C for 30 s; (5) 72 °C for 1 min; (6) repeat steps (3)-(5) for a total of 10 cycles; (7) hold at 4 °C. Amplified library was purified using the Zymo ChIP DNA Clean and Concentration Kit (D5205). The purified library was eluted using 20 µL Elution Buffer. 5 µL of 5x TBE Loading Buffer (Invitrogen; LC6678) was added and loaded in a 12-well 10% TBE gel (Invitrogen; EC62752BOX). A ladder was prepared using 0.25–0.5 µL ORangeRuler 50 bp DNA Ladder (ThermoFisher; SM0613) diluted in 5 µL 5x TBE loading buffer. The gel was run at 70 V until DNA enters the gel, then increased to 140 V for approximately one hour. The gel was stained using 10 mL 1x TBE with SYBR Gold Nucleic Acid Gel stain (Invitrogen; S11494) diluted at 1:10,000 (1 µL). The gel was cut between 175 and 225 bp markers into a 0.5 mL DNA LoBind tube perforated three times with a 22 G needle. The gel was shredded by centrifugation at maximum speed for 2 min at room temperature into a 1.5 mL DNA LoBind tube. 150 µL Diffusion Buffer (0.5 M Ammonium Acetate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Magnesium Acetate, ddH2O) was added to the gel in the 1.5 mL tube and shaken at room temperature for 45 min. The sample was then transferred to filter columns using wide-bore tips and spun at max speed for 2 min. DNA was purified (~140 µL) using the Zymo ChIP DNA Clean and Concentration Kit and eluted with 10 µL Elution Buffer into 1.5 mL DNA LoBind tubes. Final libraries were quantified with the Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit (ThermoFisher; Q33230) and stored at −20 °C prior to sequencing (yield: ~0.25 ng/µL).

Final library size distributions were assessed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser and Agilent 4200 TapeStation for quality control before sequencing. Libraries were pooled to achieve an equal representation of the desired final library size range (equimolar pooling based on Bioanalyser/TapeSation signal in the 150–800 bp range). Paired-end Illumina sequencing using the HiSeq 4000 PE75 strategy was conducted on barcoded libraries at the Imperial Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) Genomics Facility following the manufacturer's protocols.

General QC of each sample was assessed using fastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), followed by adaptor trimming using TrimGalore! (https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore). Reads were aligned to GRCh38 using bowtie2 with the following arguments: –local –very-sensitive –no-mixed –no-discordant -I 25 -X 1000. Post-alignment QC included removing: reads mapping to the mitochondrial genome, duplicate reads, multi-mapping reads, and reads with low mapping quality (q < 30). Read count generation was performed using featureCounts78. Additionally, peaks were filtered using the filterByExpr() function in DESeq231, retaining only peaks with sufficiently high counts for statistical analysis. This left 167,951 peaks for downstream analyses. The 2 APOE-KO samples with high APOE expression in the RNA-seq data were also excluded from the ATAC-seq dataset. Additionally, another APOE-KO and one APOE4 microglia sample were discarded due to having a low number of reads after QC filtering (<9 million).

General QC of each sample was assessed using fastQC (https://www.bioinformaticsf.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), followed by adaptor trimming using TrimGalore! (https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore). Reads were aligned to the GRCh38 genome and transcriptome using STAR79. Duplicate and multi-mapping reads were retained. Transcript quantification was performed using Salmon80, using the GC bias flag. Two of the APOE knockout samples with high APOE expression were excluded from subsequent analyses (Supplementary Fig. 2).

DESeq231 was used for the differential expression and differential chromatin accessibility analysis. DESeq231 was designed for the differential analysis of RNA-seq data and has since been widely used for this purpose. In a recent study comparing methods for differential analysis of ATAC-seq read counts, Gontarz et al (2020)81 showed that with five replicates, which we have for most of our samples, DESeq2 had the lowest false positive rate and a true positive recall comparable to other methods available for differential accessibility analysis. For both analyses, the APOE3 microglia samples were used as a baseline for comparison, and we additionally tested for differences between APOE4 and APOE2 microglia. To perform the differential analysis, we used the DESeq() function which provides a wrapper for three functions: estimateSizeFactors() for estimation of size factors, estimateDispersions() for estimation of dispersion, and nbinomWaldTest() for negative binomial GLM fitting and Wald statistics. Genes and peaks were defined as being significant if p < 0.05 after FDR correction.

To identify which genes had similar expression profiles across the APOE groups, we used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)47. First, transcripts with zero or low expression counts were filtered out using the filterByExpr() function in edgeR82. As suggested by the authors of WGCNA, the count data was normalised by variance stabilising transformation and explored for outliers using principal component analysis. An appropriate soft thresholding power was chosen to ensure a scale-free network and used as input to the blockwiseModules() function in WGCNA to calculate the adjacency matrix. This function was also used to detect gene co-expression modules and to calculate module eigengenes. As defined by the authors47, the module eigengenes are the first principal component of a given module and can be considered to represent the gene expression profile of that module.

The module eigengenes identified in the WGCNA analysis were used to perform differential expression analysis using the lmFit() function in limma83, across the APOE groups. As the only differentially expressed modules were associated with APOE2, the genes belonging to these modules were used to perform pathway enrichment analysis using clusterProfiler84, allowing characterisation of the APOE2-associated modules based on their gene ontology (GO) enrichments. GO terms were considered to be significantly associated with the given modules if p < 0.05 after FDR correction.

To estimate the proportion of disease SNP-heritability attributable to open chromatin regions in the xenotransplanted microglia, we performed stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression (s-LDSC). Annotation files were generated and used to compute LD scores. Publicly available GWAS summary statistics for a recent AD GWAS43 were downloaded and converted to the required format for LDSC. Steps for the analysis were followed as instructed here https://github.com/bulik/ldsc/wiki and required files were downloaded from https://alkesgroup.broadinstitute.org/LDSCORE/GRCh38. LDSC was run using the full baseline model, thereby computing the proportion of SNP-heritability associated with the annotation of interest, while taking into account all the annotations in the baseline model. As we observed a significant enrichment, we repeated the analysis using GWAS data for PD85, Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis46, and Autism spectrum disorder86, to ensure this was not a generic neurological enrichment.

MAGMA gene set analysis34 was used to assess the enrichment of AD SNP-based heritability among differentially expressed genes across the APOE isoforms. The SNP window was restricted to the gene region (0,0). Summary statistics for three independent AD GWAS were downloaded35,43,87 and formatted for use with MAGMA using MungeSumstats88. P-values were corrected using the FDR method.

Microglia progenitors, as generated according to the MIGRATE protocol, were collected on day 18 and plated in differentiation medium (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 200 mM L-glutamine, 1:2000 human insulin, 5 ng/mL N-Acetyl-L-cysteine, 50 mg/mL apo-transferrin, 20 μg/mL sodium selenite, 1 μg/mL heparin sulphate, 50ng/mL M-CSF, 100 ng/mL IL-34, 2 ng/mL transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, 10 ng/mL fractalkine (CX3CL1), 1.5 ng/mL cholesterol) in a concentration of 3.75*105 cells/mL in 8 well chamber slides (Ibidi, 80841). On day 6, microglia were incubated with 100 μg/mL pHrodo Red E.coli BioParticles (Thermofisher, P35361) for 1 h, or 200 μg/mL human myelin debris, as isolated from human brain tissue according to previously published protocol89 and fluorescently labelled according to instructions of the MINI67 cell membrane labelling kit (Sigma-Aldrich, MINI67) for 3 h. Cultures were rinsed with PBS three times and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min.

Fixed cells were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 10 min. Microglia were incubated with anti- ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1; WAKO, 019-1974, 1:500), followed by incubation with secondary Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen A21206 and A21207, 1:400), both in 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at RT. This was followed by counterstaining with 1.67 μg/mL 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Merck, D9542) for 15 min at RT. Finally, cells were mounted with Mowiol solution and stored at 4 °C until imaging.

For each well (7 per genotype and phagocytosis stimulus), three fields were imaged using a Nikon A1R Eclipse Ti confocal microscope. For each field, a z-stack of three images was acquired with steps of 2.95 μm at 10x magnification for the E.coli conditions and 0.88 μm at 20x magnification for the myelin conditions. Images were further analyzed with a custom made FIJI script (v1.53). Maximum intensity projections were generated from z-stacks, and microglia masks were generated using the ‘Analyze Particles' function on the Iba1 channel, followed by manual verification. The number of microglia positive for E. coli/myelin phagocytosis was counted with the use of the ‘Cell Counter' plugin. Thereafter, the area of E. coli/myelin signal within microglia positive for phagocytosis was measured in μm². Values from three fields per well were averaged for analysis. Differences in phagocytosis between genotypes were assessed with one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni's multiple comparisons post-hoc test in GraphPad Prism (v10.2.0).

Metrics details

Enhancer sequences evolve rapidly, which has led to the prevailing view that most are not functionally conserved across species. A study now challenges this assumption by leveraging interspecies point projection — a method that uses genome synteny to uncover hidden enhancer conservation.

Metrics details

There is limited evidence supporting the feasibility of using omics and functional technologies to inform treatment decisions. Here we present results from a cohort of 116 melanoma patients in the prospective, multicentric observational Tumor Profiler (TuPro) precision oncology project. Nine independent technologies, mostly at single-cell level, were used to analyze 126 patient samples, generating up to 500 Gb of data per sample (40,000 potential markers) within 4 weeks. Among established and experimental markers, the molecular tumor board selected 54 to inform its treatment recommendations. In 75% of cases, TuPro-based data were judged to be useful in informing recommendations. Patients received either standard of care (SOC) treatments or highly individualized, polybiomarker-driven treatments (beyond SOC). The objective response rate in difficult-to-treat palliative, beyond SOC patients (n = 37) was 38%, with a disease control rate of 54%. Progression-free survival of patients with TuPro-informed therapy decisions was 6.04 months, (95% confidence interval, 3.75–12.06) and 5.35 months (95% confidence interval, 2.89–12.06) in ≥third therapy lines. The proof-of-concept TuPro project demonstrated the feasibility and relevance of omics-based tumor profiling to support data-guided clinical decision-making. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT06463509.

Clinical decision-making in oncology is based on data derived from clinical trials that provide standardized measures of efficacy and safety. These data are evaluated by expert panels and incorporated into clinical practice guidelines of the main medical societies, which define the evidence-based standard of care (SOC) and guide diagnostic and treatment procedures through a process of shared decision-making between physicians and patients1,2. Adhering to these guidelines has been shown to improve survival rates and other outcome measures in patients with cancer3,4,5. In the case of malignant melanoma, prognosis has improved dramatically over the past decades due to implementation of efficacious SOC treatments6,7. However, many melanoma patients experience recurrence or progression of their disease. Evidence-based treatment options for these patients are limited and clinical management presents a major challenge that often falls outside the scope of clinical guidelines.

The advent of reliable and affordable functional and omics technologies, including analyses at single-cell resolution, has rapidly transformed the field of oncology8,9,10,11. Clinical trials and practice guidelines are increasingly incorporating multidimensional data that enable an unprecedented characterization of molecular drivers and therapeutic vulnerabilities specific to the individual patient's cancer, paving the way for personalized precision treatments12,13. Moreover, omics-based patient data can guide enrollment of patients in suitable clinical trials14. To integrate molecular and functional data into clinical decision-making, institutional and national multidisciplinary molecular tumor boards (MTBs) have been established15. Previously, we and others have reported on the development of pipelines that enable the use of molecular data by MTBs10,16,17. Despite the promise of precision medicine, there is limited evidence supporting feasibility and utility of using multiomics and single-cell technologies to guide selection of treatments for patients with cancer.

The Tumor Profiler (TuPro) project is a multicentric, prospective, nonrandomized observational project designed to assess the relevance of functional, single-cell and bulk omics readouts to MTB decisions18. The goal of the TuPro project is to inform both guideline-based decision-making for patients in the SOC setting, and data-driven decision-making to provide information on the status of additional, potentially relevant biomarkers beyond SOC. Here we present the outcomes for 116 melanoma patients enrolled in the TuPro project.

A fast diagnostic loop was implemented, enabling an overall turnaround time of 4 weeks from biopsy to reporting in the MTB with single-cell genomics (scDNA-seq)19 and transcriptomics (scRNA-seq)20, targeted proteomics (imaging mass cytometry (IMC)21, cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF)22), proteotyping (using data-independent acquisition (DIA)23,24,25), drug phenotyping (Pharmacoscopy11,26, iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging (4iDRP)27), targeted next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) and digital pathology (DigiPath). The selection of these technologies was based on their capability to provide a comprehensive molecular portrait of each tumor with potential clinical relevance. As a result, up to 500 Gb of data were generated and evaluated for each sample, corresponding to over 40,000 potential markers for therapy decisions. The molecular data were integrated with additional clinical and diagnostic information available for each patient during the MTB evaluation. Markers used for treatment recommendations, administered therapies, objective responses and outcomes were captured and analyzed within the project framework.

A total of 116 patients with any subtype of melanoma participated in the project, contributing 126 biopsies (including ten longitudinal samples) (Fig. 1). The enrollment period spanned 21 months from January 2019 to November 2020. The demographical, clinical and pathological features of eligible patients were recorded in a good-clinical-practice-compliant database (Extended Data Table 1). Among all biopsy specimens, 62% were obtained from patients who had been treated with at least one therapeutic regime; 43% of these patients had undergone two or more lines of treatment (Extended Data Table 1). Biopsies from ten patients were used for the project ramp-up phase, whereas 106 underwent the analysis and the discussion at the MTB (Fig. 1). Thirteen patients were excluded from further analysis; of those, seven transitioned to best supportive care (BSC) due to deteriorating clinical condition and six early-stage patients opted against the recommended therapy in the adjuvant setting. The remaining 93 patients (103 biopsy samples, 99 treatment lines) were subject to the analysis in this paper and correspond to the TuPro application population. Cases were discussed at the MTB, including guideline-based treatment options, as well as molecular and functional profiles obtained through tumor profiling, according to three patient groups:

a, Project description showing principal aspects for feasibility testing, patient populations included and information utilization. b, CONSORT flow diagram of the TuPro project. A total of 116 patients were included in the TuPro melanoma project. Part I included ten patients to establish the TuPro workflow and analysis/reporting pipeline. Part II included the remaining 106 patients in the diagnostic cohort. Thirteen patients either received BSC (n = 7) or did not receive adjuvant treatment based on shared decision-making (n = 6). The remaining 93 patients formed the TuPro application cohort, which was categorized into three groups: (1) adjuvant therapy, (2) SOC palliative therapy and (3) palliative therapy beyond SOC. In both palliative SOC and beyond SOC groups, more than one sample was evaluated for four patients. Two additional patients are both in the SOC and beyond SOC at different treatment lines.

Group 1—adjuvant setting: 13 patients with early-stage disease who underwent adjuvant treatment. These patients were administered targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy for BRAF-mutant tumors or immunotherapy involving anti-PD1 agents. One patient received anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 antibodies in the framework of an interventional trial.

Group 2—palliative SOC: 45 patients with metastatic disease who received palliative SOC therapy. These treatment regimens included immunotherapy, targeted therapy, talimogene laherparepvec and chemotherapy.

Group 3—palliative beyond SOC (henceforth referred to as beyond SOC): 37 patients with metastatic disease who underwent palliative treatments beyond SOC. These interventions comprised participation in interventional trials during any time of disease course, or the application of individualized treatments (that is, off-label drug use, or the off-label reintroduction of approved therapies following confirmed progression upon initial treatment with these agents).

The median follow-up time was 20.5 months (range 0.6–46.5 months). As of 31 May 2023, 62.4% (58 of 93) of the patients had died due to melanoma or nonmelanoma related events.

The successful integration of high-throughput analytical technologies into routine clinical practice requires a turnaround time that aligns with clinical decision-making. To meet this need, the TuPro project established a fast diagnostic loop workflow (Fig. 2a). The workflow mandates that each technology platform delivers a comprehensive sample-specific report for discussion at the pre-tumor board (pre-TB, see below) and subsequently at the MTB, which takes place within 4 weeks of biopsy. For each sample, data were generated and analyzed through a previously described process and information technology pipeline developed specifically for the TuPro project18. The data were discussed by a pre-TB expert panel and translated into marker-based treatment recommendations that were summarized in a molecular summary report (MSR). The MSR was communicated to the MTB, along with the supporting clinical and molecular data (Fig. 2a). The MTB then provided a formal treatment recommendation for the patient. Due to limitations of fresh tissue sample abundance or quality, predefined sample access priorities were assigned to individual technologies and sample processing within clinical routine practice (Fig. 2b,c). Technologies performing measurements on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue prepared for routine diagnostics (for example, IMC, NGS), were generally unaffected by limited sample abundance. IMC, targeted NGS and DigiPath received the most samples (n = 103), followed by CyTOF (n = 102), Pharmacoscopy (n = 91) and 4iDRP, (n = 79). scRNA-seq, scDNA-seq and proteotyping each received 68 samples. Most technology nodes successfully analyzed and reported results on the received samples if they passed node-specific quality requirements (Fig. 2b). Out of all samples (n = 103), 41 were analyzed successfully by all nine nodes (Fig. 2c). Considering each datapoint, over 40,000 measurements were assessed per sample as potential markers, of which 544 were analyzed using targeted technologies (Supplementary Table M1). Overall, the TuPro framework successfully established a robust multiomics and functional analysis pipeline that yielded rich individual tumor profiles, providing additional and timely insights for clinical decision-making.

a, The TuPro workflow consists of a sample acquisition and processing phase, followed by an analysis and reporting phase, with a turnaround time of ≤4 weeks. The analysis phase involved nine technological nodes, although not all samples were analyzed by each node. Data processing integrated the outputs from different technologies and enabled the generation of the MSR, which encapsulates the essential findings and actionable insights for clinicians and researchers. b, Number of samples (n = 103) analyzed per technology node (n = 9) within the fast diagnostic loop (4-week turnaround time). Given limited sample material in some cases, the assays were prioritized as indicated by color. c, UpSet plot showing the number of samples analyzed by one or more technology nodes (n = 9). d, Concordance (percentage in light blue) between the recommendations agreed upon by the MTB and those inferred from information provided by diagnostic levels level 1 (detailed clinical data, routine molecular testing data in melanoma (BRAF, NRAS and c-KIT mutations) and DigiPath data), level 2 (level 1 plus large panel NGS), or level 3 (all TuPro technology nodes, n = 9), and fraction of actual TuPro-driven therapy decisions (i.e., ≥50% of the applied drugs are supported by markers measured by TuPro). Illustrations in a created using BioRender.com.

Marker data provided in the MSR was condensed into diagnostic levels that build on each other to facilitate accessibility (Methods): level 1 incorporated detailed clinical data, routine molecular testing data plus routine pathology and DigiPath data. Level 2 additionally included results of a broad targeted NGS panel. Level 3 included level 2 data, and data provided by the seven TuPro technology nodes. Final MTB recommendations were in line with data provided by levels 1, 2 and 3 in 36%, 42% and 75% of samples, respectively. The lower percentage of MTB agreement with level 1 and 2 results mainly from a frequent lack of identifying new options for targeted therapy with standard technologies. The percentage of TuPro-driven actual treatments administered to patients (that is, treatments decided by patients and their physicians after MTB recommendations, with ≥50% of the applied drugs supported by markers measured by TuPro) reached 87% (Fig. 2d). In summary, whereas the addition of extended targeted NGS (level 2) to standard clinical workup provided only a modest impact to the MTB, functional and multiomics TuPro data (level 3) provided substantial added value to clinical decision-making compared to current diagnostic standards (NGS and DigiPath). This is reflected by the increased concordance of TuPro-informed recommendations with those of the MTB by 39% (compared to diagnostic level 1) and 33% (compared to diagnostic level 2) of cases, respectively (Fig. 2d).

Out of all available measurements, the pre-TB and the MTB participants decided on those deemed to be most useful to inform decisions. For actual treatment decisions (that is, treatments prescribed by the treating physician and supported by TuPro measurements), a total of 54 individual markers (recorded as part of the pre-TB discussions) were used (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 1a). These 54 markers correspond to 399 individual, validated measurements, including assessment of the same target by different technologies (for example, pERK level was measured by IMC, CyTOF and 4iDRP). The distribution of individual measurements that informed treatment decisions was as follows: adjuvant setting, 50 marker measurements in 13 of 13 samples (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c); palliative SOC group, 153 marker measurements in 38 of 49 samples (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 1d) and beyond SOC group, 196 marker measurements in 39 of 41 samples (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 1e). For the remaining 13 samples, no treatments driven by markers measured with TuPro technologies were administered to the patients. The average number of markers used for individual TuPro-based treatment recommendations was four in both the adjuvant and the palliative SOC cohort, and five in the beyond SOC cohort. Markers used for decision-making in the MTB with a cutoff at >2% amongst all patients, along with the specific technologies used for their assessment, are shown in Fig. 3a. The markers that most often informed the TuPro recommendations in the adjuvant setting (n = 13) were TMB (n = 9, 69%), T cell infiltration (n = 7, 54%), HLA-ABC (n = 5, 38%) and PD-L1 (n = 3, 23%) (Extended Data Fig. 1b). In the palliative SOC group (n = 39), the markers adopted most frequently were TMB (n = 15, 38%), BRAF mutations (n = 14 samples, 36%), HLA-ABC (n = 13, 33%), PD-L1 (n = 12, 31%), pERK (n = 11, 28%), T cell infiltration (n = 10, 26%), PD1 expression (n = 5, 13%) and proliferation (n = 4, 10%) (Fig. 3b). In the beyond SOC group (n = 39) they were pERK (n = 18, 46%), HLA-ABC (n = 14, 36%), TMB (n = 11, 28%), T cell infiltration (n = 9, 23%), PD-L1 (n = 8, 21%), proliferation, apoptosis, BRAF and KIT alterations (n = 7, 18% each) (Fig. 3c). Whereas DNA alterations (for example, TMB, mutations in RAS, KIT and BRAF) included United States Food and Drug Administration-recognized biomarkers (according to OncoKB12) measurable via level 2 diagnostics, the TuPro diagnostic level 3 provided markers additional to genetic markers (for example, phosphorylation, expression and drug response). Together, these findings show that multiomics marker data generated via TuPro technologies were readily accepted and implemented by the study physicians. In all three groups, both established as well as experimental markers were considered for clinical decision-making.

a, OncoPrint showing biomarkers (cutoff of >2%) detected by TuPro and used for treatment decisions (n = 90). Data on the technology node used to measure each marker, the cohort and class of treatment received (chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy) are provided. b, Markers (n = 26) used for treatment decision-making in the palliative SOC cohort. c, Markers (n = 44) used for treatment decision-making in the beyond SOC cohort.

An important question was whether similar results can be achieved with a smaller subset of technologies and markers, resulting in significantly lower profiling costs. In many instances, one marker can be measured by several technologies. A small subset of these technologies could cover all markers relevant to most patients. We performed an analysis considering all possible subsets of technologies, taking into account assumed equivalences between markers from different technologies (Supplementary Table M2a–c). For each patient, we recorded markers deemed relevant for treatment recommendations per cohort (adjuvant, SOC, beyond SOC), assuming the same recommendations would be made if all relevant markers were available. Extended Data Fig. 2 shows the number of samples (y axis) that had all relevant markers available for a specific combination of technologies. The x axis shows the cumulative cost for the combination of technologies. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed considering all possible subsets of technologies and the fraction of patients likely to have had the same treatment recommendation (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). Of note, only Pharmacoscopy and 4iDRP provide information for several treatment conditions, whereas the other technologies provide information only for untreated samples. We found that information provided by three technologies (NGS, Pharmacoscopy, IMC) (adjuvant and palliative SOC) and four technologies (NGS, Pharmacoscopy, IMC, scRNA-seq) (beyond SOC) would cover all markers used for pre-TB treatment recommendation (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). This would reduce the cost per samples to 4,602 Swiss francs in the adjuvant and palliative SOC cohort, or 7,336 Swiss francs in the beyond SOC. These costs are 1.15-fold higher than the clinical-setting costs for standard NGS analysis (up to 4,000 Swiss francs in Switzerland) for adjuvant or palliative SOC, and 1.8-fold higher for beyond SOC setting.

During the project period, approximately 180 Swissmedic-approved anti-cancer agents and 20 investigational drugs within 25 active trials in the participating centers were available. The TuPro workflow generated 510 treatment recommendations (including several recommendations per patient) encompassing 76 individual drugs. In the adjuvant group, 13 of 13 patients (100%) received treatment supported by markers measured with TuPro technologies. Three different systemic therapy regimens were administered (Fig. 4a). After a median observation time of 37.7 months, eight patients remained in remission and five patients had relapsed. In the palliative SOC group, 45 patients received 47 treatments considered SOC (two patients were serially biopsied and received two different treatments) (Fig. 4b). In 38 of 49 samples analyzed (77.5%), patients received a treatment supported by markers measured with TuPro technologies, and six different approved systemic treatment regimens were administered (Fig. 4b). The top three recommended treatment options were: (1) combination immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) (anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 antibodies), (2) TKI combination therapy (BRAF/MEK inhibitors) and (3) chemotherapy (Fig. 4b)1. In the beyond SOC group, 37 patients received 39 treatments (two patients received serial samplings and two sequential but different treatment recommendations), either through participation in an interventional clinical trial or through off-label use of approved oncological drugs. In 39 of 41 samples analyzed, (95%) treatment decisions were informed by TuPro (Fig. 4c and Table 1). Recommendations were highly individualized and 22 different therapy regimens were used for patients in the beyond SOC group. Excluding treatment recommendations based exclusively on SOC diagnostics, TuPro level 3 data informed clinical decision-making in 9 of 13 samples from patients in the adjuvant (69.2%), 30 of 49 samples of patients in the palliative SOC (61.2%) and 35 of 41 samples of patients in the palliative beyond SOC setting (85.3%).

Brackets indicate at three or more treatment lines and disease control rate. g,h, Swimmers plots showing PFS and best response to treatment for palliative SOC (g) and beyond SOC (h) groups. Two patients serially received two different treatments; another two patients received serial samplings resulting in the same treatments.

Ten patients had serial biopsies (two per patient). Two of these patients did not receive TuPro-informed recommendation and were excluded from the analysis (Supplementary Table M3). Of the remaining eight patients, two received different treatment recommendation in the SOC cohort (patient 2 and 3), one in the beyond SOC cohort (patient 6) and one patient received different recommendations leading to a switch in cohort classification (patient 1) (Supplementary Table M3 and Extended Data Fig. 3). In summary, a total of four out of eight (50%) patients with serial biopsies included in the analysis received different treatment recommendations.

For patients in the palliative SOC group, the objective response rate (ORR) was 60% and the disease control rate, which included those with complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD), was 62% (Fig. 4d). The median number of previous therapy lines in the palliative SOC group was one, ranging from zero to five; in the beyond SOC group, it was two, ranging from zero to six (Fig. 4d). With a median follow-up of 17.5 months, the median duration of response was 6.5 months, ranging from 0.6 to 46.5 months. For patients in the beyond SOC group, the ORR was 38% and the disease control rate was 54% (Fig. 4d). With a median follow-up period of 16.9 months, the median duration of response was 4.8 months, ranging from 0.2 to 46.4 months (Fig. 4g,h). Analysis of disease control rate for each treatment showed that both palliative SOC and beyond SOC groups benefited from treatments administered in third and further lines (Fig. 4e,f) (brackets indicate at least three lines of treatment and disease control rate).

The palliative SOC and beyond SOC TuPro participants (n = 86 lines of treatment) achieved a combined disease control rate (CR, PR or SD) of 61.0% (50 of 82, 4 not evaluable) (Fig. 5a). For the subgroups of patients who had already received at least three treatment lines, the disease control rate reached 56.8% (21 of 37) (Fig. 5b). Survival analysis showed a median progression-free survival (PFS) for patients in the palliative (both SOC and beyond SOC) of 6.04 months, (95% confidence interval (CI), 3.75–12.06) (Fig. 5c) and of 5.35 months (95% CI, 2.89–12.06) for subjects who were given at least three lines of treatment (n = 37) (Fig. 5d).

To further evaluate clinical benefit of the TuPro diagnostic pipeline, we retrospectively, in an exploratory way, compared outcomes of patients in the TuPro melanoma cohort with patients with melanoma from the same centers and period who were not part of the TuPro project (non-TuPro patients) (Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5, Extended Data Table 1 and Extended Data Table 2). To minimize potential bias, we performed a combined exact (treatment line, intention of treatment, clinical stage, brain metastases status) and propensity score matching (Methods), which resulted in comparable subgroups of 12 adjuvant treatments, 59 palliative treatments and 17 treatments with at least three treatment lines for TuPro and non-TuPro patients each (Supplementary Figure M1 and Extended Data Table 2).

The matched analysis of adjuvant patients (n = 12 matched treatments) showed no significant differences in relapse-free survival (RFS) (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.46 (95% CI, 0.06–3.32) (Extended Data Fig. 4 and Extended Data Table 2). For the matched palliative groups (n = 59 matched treatments), median PFS in TuPro subjects reached 9.59 months (95% CI, 3.75–17.74) and 3.55 months (95% CI, 2.56–9.17) for non-TuPro subjects (adjusted HR of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.43–1.42), adjusted P = 0.4156) (Extended Data Fig. 5g). Within these matched groups, the disease control rate was 63.6% (35 of 55, 4 not evaluable) in the TuPro cohort compared to 51.7% (30 of 58, 1 not evaluable) in the non-TuPro cohort (Extended Data Fig. 5c). For subjects who had received at least three treatment lines (n = 17 matched treatments) the median PFS in the TuPro cohort was 8.34 months (95% CI, 2.76–NR) compared to 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.08–3.06) in the non-TuPro cohort (adjusted HR of 0.23 (95% CI, 0.07–0.79), adjusted P = 0.0201) and a disease control rate of 64.7% (11 of 17) compared to 23.5% (4 of 17) (Extended Data Fig. 5d,h and Extended Data Table 2). Overall, our exploratory analysis suggests an added value for heavily pretreated patients.

The TuPro project is a pioneering, prospective, multicohort precision oncology project, integrating cutting-edge technologies for the detailed and comprehensive investigation of tumor biopsies at an unprecedented level18. Here we report several clinical-translational endpoints of the project. First, we successfully generated high-quality molecular datasets from melanoma tumor biopsies using two standard (DigiPath and NGS) and seven experimental, mostly single-cell, high-throughput technologies (Pharmacoscopy, 4iDRP, IMC, CyTOF, proteotyping, scRNA-seq and scDNA-seq), which offer distinct and complementary perspectives on tumor biology. Second, we achieved a clinically meaningful turnaround time from sample acquisition to analysis and recommendation to the MTB of 4 weeks. This fast diagnostic loop supports the notion that incorporation of multiomics technologies into clinical oncology is feasible. Third, we successfully established a data-to-treatment pipeline that presented actionable insights gained from multimodal analysis to the MTB, facilitating actual clinical decision-making. Notably, the integration of MTBs into clinical decision-making correlates with improvements in various outcome measures28. Nevertheless, randomized controlled trials that formally assess these results need to be conducted in the future.

The treatment landscape for advanced melanoma has changed considerably over the past decade. The introduction of ICIs targeting PD1, CTLA-4 and LAG-3, as well as therapies addressing dysregulated and oncogenic MAPK pathway alterations (for example, BRAF and MEK mutations), has led to an unprecedented improvement in overall survival. Landmark clinical trials have demonstrated in first line striking ORRs of up to 58% and 68% for ICIs29,30 and BRAF and MEK inhibitors31, respectively. The 60% ORR observed in the TuPro palliative SOC group of first and further line patients compares favorably with published data. Notably, BRAF class I mutations currently are the only predictive biomarker used to determine eligibility for targeted therapy options1,2. However, single biomarker strategies have limitations, which are reflected by (1) a considerable number of patients with poor responses; (2) several negative high-profile clinical trials employing this strategy7,32,33; (3) genotype-matched trials (for example, MatchMel, SHIVA, MOSCATO, IMPACT/COMPACT) resulting in low target-drug matching rates (5–30%) or limited availability of interventional trials, and overall poor outcomes (ORR, 11–19%)34,35,36,37,38,39, and (4) single genetic alterations capturing only a fraction of the vastly complex biology of tumors. Both the successes and limitations outlined above form a strong rational for an expanded biomarker and/or assay panel to enable an in-depth mechanism-based therapy prediction for individual patients.

The TuPro project integrated various layers of molecular and cellular information, encompassing phosphorylation, cell–cell interactions, characteristics of the tumor microenvironment, inflammatory/immune markers, and ex vivo drug response. These factors are anticipated to play an important role in advanced and personalized predictive decision-making processes40,41,42. In the beyond SOC group, individual therapy recommendations were generated based on a larger number of individual markers compared to the palliative SOC group (average five versus four, respectively). For both groups of patients, this multimarker approach resulted in clinical meaningful responses in 38% of patients beyond SOC compared to 60% in the palliative SOC group. Although markers used to inform clinical decision-making within the TuPro project are biased toward known mechanisms and available drugs, the swift adoption of the expanded marker panel shows that clinicians rapidly acquire confidence in new readouts to support therapy. The project incorporated drugs that are not traditionally used in clinical care for melanoma patients. Therefore, the response rates in the beyond SOC TuPro cohort compare favorably when viewed from the perspective of other tumor-agnostic or phase I/II clinical trials, where substantial variations in ORR rates of 2–53% and median PFS of 5–7 months have been observed43,44,45,46.

Our analysis comparing the TuPro cohort with a synchronous non-TuPro melanoma cohort suggests that omics-guided treatments, such as in the TuPro project, result in comparable or better outcomes in terms of disease control rates and PFS, thus providing a rationale to further explore the analysis of -omics data as a means of therapy prediction in patients with melanoma. These data advocate that the expanded marker assessment via multiomics and functional technologies may contribute to address an unmet clinical need for difficult-to-treat patient populations. The ever-expanding range of therapeutic options necessitates a comprehensive understanding of tumor biology and individual patient characteristics. The TuPro project is uniquely positioned to achieve both immediate patient benefits and biological discoveries at the cohort level, which are currently under investigation.

We recognize several limitations of the analyses described and opportunities to improve future study designs. The current approach of selecting markers for treatment decisions by human experts cannot capture all potentially relevant information. The poor response in several patients treated with individualized therapies may reflect this shortcoming. The advent and rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and machine learning methods will probably need to be leveraged to translate the extensive complexity of TuPro datasets into enhanced clinical benefit. Further process optimization and efficacy improvements will facilitate the full implementation of all available technologies. Interpretations regarding clinical utility of serial biopsies are limited by heterogenous results and small sample size. The retrospective comparison of TuPro and non-TuPro patient limits extrapolation and generalizability. Although we attempted to provide comparable results using matched cohorts, the project was first and foremost a feasibility study. One main goal was to identify patients with melanoma most likely to benefit from extended TuPro analysis. To this end, patient inclusion was broad, leading to a heterogenous population. Benefit was seen mostly in the beyond SOC cohort in patients failing several lines of treatment. Given key uncertainties (patients who are most likely to benefit, expected effect size, technology performance, feasibility of clinical translation of findings by the MTB) a randomized trial would not have been feasible at the time the project was designed. Clearly blinded, randomized trials are needed to confirm our findings in a next step.

Based on our calculations, the per patient cost of analysis in the beyond SOC setting is above the current coverage limits by health insurance for a NGS panel (up to 4,000 Swiss francs in Switzerland) yet only exceeds this limit by a factor of 1.8 when using a limited number of technologies that would possibly deliver the same answers. In addition, we demonstrate that at costs comparable to those covered by insurance (4602 Swiss francs), we were able to successfully profile 38 out of 39 patients (97%) within the SOC setting. The current cost estimates fall within a range that allows for evaluation of potential benefits through a randomized trial. In conclusion, TuPro has successfully pioneered the integration of predictive polymarker assessment with marker-driven, highly individualized treatments, demonstrating the feasibility of complex and comprehensive data-driven approaches to improve patient care.

TuPro was conducted as a multicentric precision oncology project according to the Swiss Act and Ordinance on Human Research (HFG and HFV) with approval of, and in compliance with, regulatory authorities (ethics committees of northwestern Switzerland, EKNZ, and of Zurich, KEK). Adult patients diagnosed with any subtype of melanoma, both treatment-naive and those treated either in the adjuvant or palliative setting were eligible for inclusion. The project was conducted at the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, at the Department of Oncology, University Hospital Basel and at the Department of Oncology and Hematology, Kantonsspital Baselland, Switzerland, from January 2019 until November 2020 (EC-ID, 2018-02050, 2021-01584) in accordance with the applicable legal and institutional standards. The project was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT06463509). For each specific (single agent or combined) off-label treatment, regardless of whether the Tumor Board decision was based on routine patient data or the MSR, the project allowed inclusion of up to five patients. If the same off-label treatment was proposed to a sixth patient, the patient had to be referred to an interventional trial. Due to the diversity of tumor board recommendations, the number of more than five identical off-label treatments was not reached in the cohort we report here. Treatments were not given as part of the study. Separate consents were required for any selected treatment regimens. All decisions regarding treatment regimens were made by the treating physician and, although it could be influenced by the TuPro data, the final treatment selection for each patient was at the sole discretion of the treating physician based on their experience and expertise. The demographical, clinical and pathological features of eligible patients, including age range, sex, melanoma subtype, stage (according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer, eighth edition), together with previous treatments and treatments after biopsy collection, were obtained from our institutional database (Klinikinformationssystem (KISIM)) and entered in the good-clinical-practice-compliant database secuTrial v.6.1.2.5, 2021 (Extended Data Table 1). Sex- and gender-based analyses were not conducted due to the small sample size and the feasibility-focused nature of the study, which did not include sex- or gender-specific stratification. Eligible female and male patients (n = 116), age range 20–89 years, underwent tissue biopsies as part of their diagnostic workup. Leftover tissue samples from routine diagnostics were used in this study, with participants providing project-specific written informed consent. Participants did not receive compensation for their involvement in the study. Experienced pathologists evaluated the biopsy samples for viability and tumor cell content (requiring a minimum of 20% viable tumor cells). Samples meeting these quality criteria were further processed in a central laboratory and underwent paraffin embedding or single-cell dissociation. On average, 2,000,000 viable single tumor cells per sample were recovered. Samples were transferred to the following analytical platforms (referred to as technology nodes) for further processing and analysis: CyTOF22, IMC21, scRNA-seq20, scDNA-seq19, mass spectrometry proteotyping23,24,25, Pharmacoscopy11,26 or 4iDRP27. To establish technical feasibility, robustness, and reproducibility of sample and data handling logistics, ten (n = 10) samples were initially analyzed and results were not discussed at the MTB. The remaining samples (n = 116) were analyzed within the TuPro framework and were reported to the MTB via an MSR.

As a feasibility project, outcomes were broadly defined as follows:

Feasibility outcomes: types of molecular information and combinations of molecular information from the biotechnology domain that the pre-TB considers as useful for making a treatment recommendation beyond routine diagnostics (including routine pathology and panel NGS testing).

Classification of proposed treatment options based on TuPro measurements: (a) on-label treatment with molecular matched treatment (label of the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products, SwissMedic, as a reference) ± radiotherapy or chemotherapy; (b) treatment with classical chemotherapy ± radiotherapy (on label if label available); (c) referral to a suitable clinical trial; (d) off-label treatment (SwissMedic label as a reference) with molecular matched treatment or immunotherapy ± radiotherapy or chemotherapy; (e) off-label treatment (authorization in countries with comparable approval and control systems for medicinal products as defined by SwissMedic) with molecular matched treatment or immunotherapy ± radiotherapy or chemotherapy; (f) immunotherapy; (g) no active anti-tumor treatment (BSC).

Clinical outcomes: (a) best response to treatment, assessed radiologically after treatment initiation, classified according to RECIST criteria; (b) PFS as the duration in months between the date of treatment initiation (first medication intake) and the date of the first radiologically confirmed progression, if progression occurred.

The TuPro protocol is available upon request to the Tumor Profiler Center (TPC) (nicola.miglino@usz.ch). To comply with applicable laws and regulations (the Swiss Human Research Act), all deidentified clinical data relevant to this publication are provided as supporting information to the paper. Access to the patient-level clinical and biological data presented at the MTBs will be granted to registered users listed on the data access agreement with the TPC within 4 weeks of receipt of the Data Access Agreement, provided that the applicant submits all necessary ethics committee approvals and supporting documents needed to meet the requirements of the agreement. Data access can be requested by contacting the TPC (nicola.miglino@usz.ch). The user institution agrees to destroy or discard the data once it is no longer used for the project, and in cases where data must be archived, they must be deleted within 10 years of the project's completion. If data have not been archived, they must be deleted no later than 2 years following the completion of the project. An extension to this period can be provided upon request to the TPC leadership. Data sharing is subject to honoring patient privacy and data integrity.

The readouts obtained from the clinical standard technologies and the TuPro experimental technologies generated up to 500 Gb of data for each tumor sample. The goal was to analyze and summarize this vast amount of data in a clinically meaningful manner. We aimed to identify datapoints that were valuable for decision-making and determine the necessary steps to ensure the usability and reliability of therapy predictions to enhance patient outcomes. To this end, detailed discussions between members from various technology nodes, data scientists, molecular pathologists and clinicians in the pre-TB condensed this information into the MSR. The report summarized all drugs recommended by NGS, Pharmacoscopy or 4iDRP, plus the supporting or counter-indicating evidence from the other technologies (CyTOF, IMC, scRNA-seq, scDNA-seq, proteotyping, DigiPath). Recommendations were based on associations between drugs and markers, including drug–gene, drug–signaling and drug–immune environment pairs. These associations were supported by varying levels of evidence (for example, OncoKB, clinical guidelines, preclinical evidence). For instance, response to MEK inhibitors (for example, trametinib) was associated with mutated NRAS, BRAF, GNAQ/GNA11, NF1 and/or an activated MAPK pathway, indicated by pERK. ICIs (for example, nivolumab) response was linked to HLA expression, an inflammatory tumor phenotype and checkpoint expression. The TuPro protocol did not stipulate how the MSR should be used by the MTB. However, clinicians adhered to available and applicable guidelines such as from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), which included recommendations on off-label medication use and the regulatory standards for patient allocation to clinical projects or trials.

To assess the additional value of TuPro data in conjunction with standard technologies such as NGS and digital pathology, a stepwise evaluation process at the pre-TB was established. Level 1 included detailed clinical information, patient history, genetic tumor data (BRAF, NRAS, c-KIT) and insights from DigiPath. For level 2, the results of a large NGS panel of 324 genes (FoundationOne CDx) were incorporated into the assessment of level 1. Level 2 was considered the most comprehensive SOC evaluation at the time for patients with advanced melanoma. Level 3 additionally implemented data provided by the seven experimental TuPro technology nodes (CyTOF, IMC, scRNA-seq, scDNA-seq, proteotyping, Pharmacoscopy, 4iDRP). Findings for level 3 were summarized by the TuPro reporting and clinical teams within the framework of the pre-TB. Only medications approved by SwissMedic (on or off label, around 180 at the time of the project) or drugs under investigation in clinical trials at one of the TuPro centers (n = 20) were considered. The complete MSR for each participant was communicated to the MTB to inform treatment recommendations.

The assessment of clinical usefulness for each marker and technology was carried out in the TuPro application cohort (n = 93 patients and 99 lines of therapy) (Fig. 1). This population consists of patients who were discussed in both pre-TB and MTB, had all levels of treatment recommendations recorded, received anti-cancer treatment and had available outcome assessments. The TuPro application cohort was categorized into three groups: (1) adjuvant therapy (decision between two standards, TKI therapy for BRAF-mutant tumors versus immunotherapy, and one trial-associated therapy, anti-CTLA-4 + anti-PD1), (2) palliative therapy within the SOC (that is, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, talimogene laherparepvec, chemotherapy) and (3) palliative therapy beyond the SOC (interventional trials, off-label use, or off-label reintroduction of approved therapies after confirmed progression upon treatment with these agents). Two patients were sequentially included first in the SOC and later in the beyond SOC group. Of note, in this diagnostic proof-of-concept project, patients were not preselected to allow for TuPro-directed treatment, that is, there was no inclusion criterion regarding life expectancy.

Treatment decisions were considered TuPro-driven if ≥50% of the drugs administered were selected based on markers reported by a TuPro technology node15. This also applied to patients who were already undergoing treatment, when alterations reported by TuPro technologies confirmed ≥50% of the drugs in the ongoing treatment regimen.

The costs for multiomics profiling were assessed as marginal costs of production, that is, the cost of one additional analysis on an otherwise fully funded analysis platform running at full capacity. The market price was used for the cost of the NGS genomic marker test. For experimental technologies, costs were assessed using Swiss research prices (Swiss Personalized Oncology program costs, DigiPath) accounting for personnel costs (analysis time and full-time-equivalent salary costs) as well as costs of reagents.

All patients receiving therapy in the TuPro project underwent regular assessments following standard operating procedures at the participating institutions. Response assessment was conducted every 2–3 months using medical imaging scored via RECIST v.1.1 criteria. Full patient follow-up extended for the duration of the project and an additional 6 months after the project's conclusion. PFS was calculated from the date of therapy initiation to documented disease progression or until the last follow-up for nonprogressed patients with a cutoff date on 31 May 2023. Clinical endpoints were defined in the project protocol and included the number of cases in which the MTB deemed the MSR useful, number of cases in which treating physicians found the MTB recommendations beneficial, specific information (markers) considered relevant by the MTB for treatment recommendations beyond routine diagnostics (DigiPath, NGS), classification of proposed treatment options (in-label, off-label, trial, BSC or no therapy), ORR (which included CR and PR), disease control rate (CR, PR, SD), duration of response, time to next therapy or BSC and the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to toxicity.

In an exploratory, retrospective analysis, outcomes in the TuPro cohort were compared to those of melanoma patients who were not recruited into TuPro but received diagnostic assessment and subsequent systemic therapy at the TuPro centers over a comparable period (1 February 2019 to 1 July 2021) (Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5, Extended Data Table 2 and Supplementary Table M4). The comparison cohort included 141 patients followed until 31 May 2023, who received 216 therapies (6 neoadjuvant, 75 adjuvant, 96 palliative SOC, 39 beyond SOC). In addition to comparing unmatched RFS, PFS and response rates, a matched analysis was performed to establish comparable subgroups and reduce bias.

The TuPro treatments were matched (1:1) to the non-TuPro treatments using a genetic matching algorithm (MatchIt package47) without replacement with propensity scores estimated with a multivariate logistic regression model including the following pretreatment variables: Charlson Comorbidity index, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score (0–5), histologic subtype, lactate dehydrogenase levels at baseline, tumor mutational burden and pathogenic mutational status of BRAF (yes/no). Treatments with missing matching variables were excluded before the matching (n = 14 non-TuPro treatments). To optimize cohort comparability, we combined propensity score matching with exact matching for all palliative comparisons with the following variables: clinical stage (I–IV), intention of treatment (SOC, beyond SOC), treatment line (1–8) and presence of brain metastases (yes/no). In the adjuvant group, exact matching was performed based solely on clinical stage, as treatment intention, treatment line and brain metastases are not applicable in this setting. This led to 59 palliative treatments matched (leaving 27 TuPro and 76 non-TuPro treatments unmatched), 17 palliative at least three treatment lines matched (leaving 20 TuPro and 9 non-TuPro treatments unmatched) and 12 adjuvant treatments matched (leaving 1 TuPro and 63 non-TuPro treatments unmatched).

Unadjusted rates and adjusted odds ratios were calculated for the binary outcome of either disease control (CR, PR, SD) or progression (PD). Mixed-effects adjusted logistic regression models were used to explore the association between disease control and TuPro participation. The models for the unmatched analysis included the following variables as covariates: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (binary variable, ≥2), lactate dehydrogenase at baseline, presence of brain metastases (yes/no), age, clinical stage (III or IV), intention of treatment (adjuvant, SOC, beyond SOC) and treatment line (< or ≥ third line). In the subanalysis of treatments for subjects treated with three or more lines of therapy, the treatment line and clinical stage was excluded as a covariate. In the models for the matched cohorts, the propensity score served as a covariate. Median RFS and PFS were estimated using a Cox model with frailty to account for patients receiving several treatments. A mixed-effects Cox proportional-hazards regression model was used to calculate adjusted HRs and P values comparing RFS and PFS between TuPro versus non-TuPro treatments with random effects accounting for patients with several included treatments. The unmatched analysis utilized the same covariates as the corresponding best treatment response models, and the matched analysis included the propensity score as a covariate. In the unmatched adjuvant analysis, presence of brain metastases, intention of treatment and treatment line were excluded as covariates. The proportional hazard assumption was tested with the Schoenfeld residual test, for which variables with a P value > 0.05, were considered to fulfill the assumption. All analyses tested the null hypothesis using a two-sided 0.05 significance level and included 95% CI calculations. R (R Core Team, v.4.4.1) was used for all statistical analyses.

a, adjuvant, b, palliative SOC cohort, c, palliative beyond SOC. The x-axis shows the marginal costs in Swiss francs (CHF) of production, representing the cost of one additional analysis using a combination of technology nodes running at full capacity. The y-axis shows the number of patients that would have all relevant information available with the corresponding subset of technologies when compared to using all technologies. The labels on each data node indicate the individual technology nodes and combined cost per sample. Each dot corresponds to a different combination of technologies associated with a total cost for that combination. Only the best combinations are shown, as other combinations have a higher cost or a smaller number of samples with available relevant information. This analysis provides a better understanding of the cost-effectiveness of various diagnostic approaches and the trade-offs between the generated information and associated expenses.

First column (Patient) shows patients with serial biopsies (n = 8, two biopsies per patient). Second (Sample ID) and third (Treatment) column showing both biopsy samples per patient. Orange: serial biopsies leading to different treatment recommendations, light green: serial biopsies not changing treatment decision.

“My predictions about achieving full self-driving have been optimistic in the past,” Musk admitted to investors in 2023. “I'm the boy who cried FSD."" He certainly has. Many times. Indeed, Musk has a long history of making outlandish promises and unfulfilled predictions about his businesses—and it's a habit that seems hard to break.

On the Tesla earnings call with investors in late April, Elon Musk reportedly sounded aggrieved as he was forced to acknowledge a woeful 71 percent dip in profits. On the defensive, and seemingly grasping for positive spin among the dire results, Musk promised something implausible: The carmaker would become the world's leading robotics company, ushering in the “closest thing to heaven we can get on Earth.” (He has since doubled down on this, stating that demand for his robots will be insatiable, and earlier this month he claimed that robots will number in the tens of billions and be like “your own personal C-3PO or R2-D2, but even better.”)

On the call, despite tanking worldwide sales for his company's aging cars and cratering demand for the Cybertruck, Musk asserted the “future for Tesla is brighter than ever.” He batted away the precipitous fall in sales as merely “near-term headwinds,” urging investors to ignore the non-autonomous-car business and assess the “value of the company” on “delivering sustainable abundance with our affordable AI-powered robots.”

Still, even though Musk has a long history of broken promises, investors seemed soothed by tales of crushing market domination for Tesla, not as the car company it is today, but as the robotics behemoth Musk claims it will soon become.

WIRED examined the history of Musk's pledges on everything from Full Self Driving, Hyperloop, Robotaxis, and, yes, robot armies, with a view to reminding ourselves, his fans, and investors how reality in Elon's world rarely matches up to the rhetoric. Tellingly, Musk's fallback forecast of “next year” turns up repeatedly, only to be consistently proven wrong.

“My predictions have a pretty good track record,” Musk told Tesla staff at an all-hands meeting in March. Here's a chronological look at that track record.

“[Our] long term plan is to build a wide range of models, including affordably priced family cars,” wrote Elon Musk in the Tesla Secret Master Plan hosted on the Tesla website 19 years ago. “When someone buys the Tesla Roadster,” he added, “they are actually helping pay for development of the low-cost family car.”

In Master Plan, Part Deux, written 10 years after the first plan, Musk reiterated that, even though Tesla had not yet delivered on the 2006 promise, it still planned to build an “affordable, high-volume car.” 2016 came and went without an entry-level car. In January this year, Musk said that—finally—Tesla would start producing the affordable model in the second half of 2025.

However, in April, Reuters reported that Tesla had scrapped plans for the cheap family car. Musk posted on X that “Reuters is lying (again),” eliciting the Reuters response that “[Musk] did not identify any specific inaccuracies.” A Tesla source told Reuters that instead of the long-promised cheap family car, “Elon's directive is to go all in on robotaxi.”

While he did not directly own any of the Hyperloop companies, in a 58-page white paper titled “Hyperloop Alpha”, Musk wrote of a “new open source form of transportation that could revolutionize travel.” It didn't. The Hyperloop was shuttered in 2023, 10 years after it was first proposed—but even as late as 2022, Musk was still promising that Hyperloop could go from Boston to New York City “in less than half an hour.”

A form of magnetic levitation (maglev) capsule in an air-evacuated steel tube on stilts, Hyperloop was described on the company's website as being an “ultra-high-speed public transportation system in which passengers travel in autonomous electric pods at 600+ miles per hour.” This description has since been removed but was documented by Electrek. Engineers from Tesla and SpaceX worked on Hyperloop for two years before the project was taken up by other companies in 2017.

Musk said at a tech conference in 2013 that his Hyperloop idea—which wasn't new; George Medhurst of London first discussed the idea of moving goods pneumatically through cast-iron pipes in 1799—would be a “cross between a Concorde and a railgun and an air hockey table.” Hyperloop One—later Virgin Hyperloop—raised around $450 million from various investors, including Richard Branson, with a passenger test achieving a speed of 107 mph, almost 500 mph less than Musk originally proposed.

Cynics have long alleged Musk's floating of Hyperloop was a ruse to kill California's high-speed rail project, a belief boosted by a claim in Walter Isaacson's 2023 authorized biography of Musk. “Musk told me that the idea originated out of his hatred for California's proposed high-speed rail system,” wrote Isaacson, claiming that Musk thought that “with any luck, the high-speed rail would be canceled.”

In 2013, Tesla posted a job opening for an Advanced Driver Assistance Systems Controls Engineer who will be “responsible for developing vehicle-level decision-making and lateral and longitudinal control strategies for Tesla's effort to pioneer fully automated driving.” Musk says: “We should be able to do 90 percent of miles driven [autonomously] within three years.”

“Tesla will have a car that can do full autonomy in about three years,” promises Musk. Then in December 2015: “We're going to end up with complete autonomy,” pushes Musk, “and I think we will have complete autonomy in approximately two years.”

In January 2016: “I think that within two years you'll be able to summon your car from across the country,” muses Musk.

June 2016: “I consider autonomous driving to be a basically solved problem,” says Musk. “We're less than two years away from complete autonomy.”

November 2018: “I think we'll get to full self-driving next year,” Musk tells Kara Swisher.

“Our goal is, and I feel pretty good about this goal, that we'll be able to do a demonstration drive of full autonomy all the way from LA to New York—from home in LA to let's say dropping you off in Time Square in New York, and then having the car go park itself—by the end of next year,” vows Musk, who can't resist upping the ante by stressing that this cross-country journey will be made “without the need for a single touch, including the charger.”

A snake-like automatically-deployed charger plugged by Musk the year prior was trialled, but never made it into production.

Then, less than a year later, in April 2017: “I think we're still on track for being able to go cross-country from LA to New York by the end of the year, fully autonomous,” Musk tells TED Conference curator Chris Anderson in a fireside TED chat.

“Still on for end of year,” says Musk of the coast-to-coast autopilot demo. “Just software limited,” he adds.

Musk floats the idea of congestion-beating tunnels beneath cities with cars shot along on skates at 125 miles per hour. “By having an elevator … you can integrate the entrance and exits to [a] tunnel network just by using two parking spaces. And then the car gets on a skate. There's no speed limit here, so we're designing this to be able to operate at 200 kilometers an hour.”

This is the first outing for Musk's Boring tunnel concept. The Boring Company was supposed to deliver an underground maze of tunnels where passengers could travel in autonomous vehicles at 150 miles per hour.

The goal, said Musk, was to build one mile of tunnel per week. “Finally, finally, finally, there is something that I think can solve the goddamn traffic problem,” boasted Musk.

So far, only Las Vegas has one short system, the 1.7-mile LVCC Loop. Forty feet below the Las Vegas Convention Center, the Boring Company's tunnel opened in 2021 and currently takes paying passengers between three stations in chauffeur-driven Model Y Tesla cars which slow to just 15 miles per hour when the tunnels get congested.

Elon Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 with the aim of merging artificial intelligence with the human brain via an implantable interface. In 2017, the claim was that his Neuralink brain chip startup's first product would be on the market “in about four years.”

In the second half of 2020 Musk shows the hardware's ability to read the brain activity of a pig with a surgically implanted chip transmitting data wirelessly. He describes the AI-powered chip as “a FitBit in your skull with tiny wires” and then predicts the tech could one day cure paralysis and give the human race telepathy and superhuman vision.

In 2024, seven years after that initial four-year prediction, the first human trial subject receives a Neuralink implant (though some researchers show frustration over a lack of information about the study.)

“Probably technically be able to [self-deliver Teslas to customers' doors] in about a year,” writes Musk on X.

“When do we think it is safe for full self driving?” asks Musk on a Q4 earnings call. “Probably towards the end of this year.” Then just a month later, in February, he's certain. “We will be feature complete [with] full self-driving this year,” promises Musk on an innovations podcast. “The car will be able to … take you all the way to your destination without an intervention this year. I'm certain of that. That is not a question mark.”

By April, Musk is repeating this claim, promising during a four-hour Tesla presentation billed as Autonomy Day, “We expect to be feature-complete in self-driving this year, and we expect to be confident enough … to say that we think people do not need to touch the wheel and can look out the window probably around the second quarter of next year.”

“In the future, any car that does not have autonomy would be about as useful as a horse,” Musk tells Lex Fridman on the MIT's researcher's podcast, also in April 2019. Full autonomy from a Tesla would arrive “very, very quickly,” Musk says, adding, “I think it will require detecting hands on wheel for at least six months.” Such detection is still required.

Two years later, in January 2021, Musk on an earnings call states: “I'm highly confident the car will drive itself for the reliability in excess of a human this year. This is a very big deal.” But by December, appearing for his third time on the Lex Fridman podcast, Musk is asked again when Tesla would solve Level 4 FSD. “It's looking quite likely that it will be next year,” he says.

Fast-forward to May 2023 and Musk is telling CNBC's David Faber “I mean, it does look like [full autonomy is] gonna happen this year.”

“We expect to have the first operating robot taxi next year with no one in them,” claimed Musk on Autonomy Day. “Next year for sure, we'll have over a million robotaxis on the road,” he promises.

Fast-forward to April's earnings call this year, and Musk says that Tesla will unveil its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, next month. Initially a paid ride-hailing service with up to 20 Model Y vehicles supervised remotely, if it hits the June target this is a far cry from Musk's 2019 expectation that Tesla would have 1 million driverless robotaxis on the road by the following year.

If a small number of Tesla's robotaxis do turn up in Austin, people may be unwilling to be seen in the cars given the public backlash against Musk's role at DOGE and his controversial public statements and salutes. Federal regulators are also sniffing around. On May 12 this year, it was revealed that NHTSA has written to Tesla asking for extensive details on the robotaxi rollout. “As you are aware,” the long letter to Tesla stated, “NHTSA has an ongoing defect investigation into FSD collisions in reduced roadway visibility conditions.”

“I'm extremely confident that level 5–or essentially complete autonomy–will happen … this year,” Musk said in a video message at the opening of Shanghai's World Artificial Intelligence Conference. “There are no fundamental challenges remaining,” he stated.

Then, in the following December, Musk shifts the goal line and doubles down. “I'm extremely confident that Tesla will have level 5 next year,” Musk tells Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer SE. How confident? “100 percent,” replies Musk. Musk also tells Döpfner that a human will possibly step onto Mars by 2024.

As recently as April this year, Musk states on an earnings call: “We'll start to see the prosperity of autonomy take effect in a material way around the middle of next year … There will be millions of Teslas operating autonomously, fully autonomously in the second half of next year,” he adds.

Musk has been promising Tesla would produce a humanoid robot—Optimus—since 2021. At an all-hands meeting earlier this year he promised this “robot buddy” would “clean your house, will mow the lawn, will walk the dog, will teach your kids, will babysit, and will also enable the production of goods and services with basically no limit.” He predicted that “hopefully” Tesla will be able to make about 5,000 Optimus robots this year. “That's the size of a Roman legion,” he stated.

Musk then claimed Tesla would make “probably 50,000-ish [Optimus robots] next year.” He further claimed that Optimus “will be the biggest product of all time by far—nothing will even be close. It'll be 10 times bigger than the next biggest product ever made. Ultimately, I think we'll be making tens of millions of robots a year.” Mere seconds later, he upped the ante even further, stating that, no, Tesla would actually make “maybe 100 million robots a year.”

However, in April he told investors that production could be impacted by the restrictions on rare-earth metal exports China implemented in response to President Trump's tariffs. There's no date yet for the launch of Optimus.

“So many people are convinced [that Musk] is a miracle worker,” says auto journalist Ed Niedermeyer, author of the 2019 book Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors. “People see his wealth on paper and assume there's nothing he can't do. As the world constantly rearranges itself in his favor, they keep believing in him. This cannot keep going forever.”

When it comes to his car business at least, Musk seems fully aware of what's at stake. Perhaps this is driving his never-ending FSD optimism? My “overwhelming focus is on solving full self-driving,” he said during a June 2022 interview with three Tesla fanboys. “It's really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero.”

Earlier this year, Kelley Blue Book reporter Sean Tucker wrote: “Elon Musk is fond of telling investors that Tesla is now an automation company, not an automaker. But the company's signature products are cars. Unless it can change its strategy to develop new products with widespread appeal, its high watermark as an automaker may be in the past.”

With plummeting sales and increased scrutiny, Musk may soon come to rue the fact that he hasn't managed to make good on so many assurances since 2006 when he wrote, in a foundational pledge, that Tesla's goal—still not delivered, and supposedly finally starting production next month—was to produce an affordable family car. Maybe next year?

In the fiercely competitive Android smartphone market, British startup Nothing is trying to do things a little differently—from its product design to its pricing strategy. “Remember a time where every new product made you excited?"" the company asks on its website. ""We're bringing that back.”

There's more to Nothing than just smartphones these days, though. It's got a range of earbuds for a variety of budgets and uses, and recently teased that it's developing its first pair of over-ears—not long after announcing a new partnership with British hi-fi brand KEF. It has also developed a line of products under the CMF by Nothing sub-brand, which produces even lower-priced products, including a $69 smartwatch. But how does a brand that's keen to be disruptive remain competitive in an industry that's struggling for innovation? We asked its founder, Carl Pei.

WIRED: In March, you released your latest smartphone, the Nothing Phone (3a). What do you think are Nothing's strengths, compared to what's out there already?

Carl Pei: First of all, we are the only startup in the industry, so we actually have a lot of disadvantages. We are one of the smallest teams in the industry, so we have a fragile supply chain and low cash flow.

However, I think where we're stronger is our creativity. We have to be—if we don't have industrial scale, we need creativity to remain competitive in this industry.

Another advantage is the size of the manufacturers we compete with. When you're very big, you have to target all customers—young, old, and everyone in between. We, on the other hand, can focus on a specific group of users. Like creatives. The new “Essential Space” feature [on Nothing Phone 3a] is aimed at them, for example, to help them store and organize new ideas as they emerge.

And then there's also our software. The smartphone market is becoming very boring. We believe we are the only ones who can make it ""fun"" again.

The Nothing Phone (3a) is the latest model of Nothing's smartphone line.

What does creativity mean to you?

Creativity is not only about design, fashion, or art, but about solving problems.

Humans have a remarkable ability to connect different pieces of information to solve new problems. I think software engineers can be extremely creative. Now, in the age of AI, human creativity is even more important. In the long term, when humanity becomes a civilization that expands into space, it's creativity that's going to make us more competitive in the universe.

That is why we want to make technology ""fun"" again, to help inspire human creativity. Personally, I was very inspired by Apple when I was younger—the first iPod, the first iPhone—that's the reason I'm in this industry.

But now the creative companies of the past have become very big and very corporate, and they're no longer very creative. They're no longer inspirational for the younger generation. So we are trying to bring that back.

We're also trying to be very transparent and human in our business efforts. For example, if you watch our YouTube videos, you'll see that we try to introduce the Nothing team, like our designers and software developers, so that you can get to know them.

This is our way of doing things and our way of thinking. We hope it will encourage more young people to express their creativity.

Carl Pei has long emphasized that he wants to make technology “fun” again.

Is your strategy working? How's business?

Looking back on the last four and a half years, I think it is working. We face a lot of problems on a daily basis, but we cannot survive in this industry if we follow the same strategies as other companies. We have to be different.

And the business is growing rapidly. Last year, we grew about 150 percent. However, we still only reached about 0.1% share of the global market, so there is plenty more to do.

How do you plan to get there? What's the growth plan?

I think the big trend we are all seeing right now is AI, and I think everyone is very stressed wondering what kind of AI functions they should launch. But I think they're looking at it wrong.

Before the introduction of the iPod, it was common knowledge in the industry that an MP3 player with a hard drive would be the next big thing. At the time, companies such as South Korea's iriver and Singapore's Creative had also launched MP3 players with hard drives, but iPod became the market leader because it got everything right.

Apple had the best design in the iPod, it had the best interface with the scroll wheel. It had the best integration of hardware and software, with iTunes for music management, and it had the best business model. All of a sudden, you could buy one song for $1 instead of having to buy the whole album! So it had the best overall package.

I think there's a lot of similarities with AI today. We all know it's the next big thing, and everyone is trying to figure out exactly what's important there. But all we want to do is create the best product for our users. It is not about working quickly to create something and shoving AI into it to tick a box.

If you look back, the iPod was not launched as “an MP3 player with a hard disk drive.” The hard disk drive was merely a means to a better user experience. AI is just a new technology that enables us to create better products for users. So, our strategy is not to make big claims that AI is going to change the world and revolutionize smartphones. For us, it's about using it to solve a consumer problem, not to tell a big story. We want the product to be the story.

In that respect, Apple today is very different from the Apple when I was younger. Last year, they told a very big story about Apple Intelligence. Now, a year later, it's not much more than some generated emojis. So it's made consumers very skeptical.

Do you think more can be done with AI?

I think the way we use devices will change in the future. In the short term, I don't think we will see new forms of hardware really taking off. People are trying with different things like smart glasses and the Humane AI Pin, but I don't believe in these form factors right now, because the market is so small. Smart glasses are about 1 million units per year, and devices like the AI Pin are about 5,000 units per year.

A smartphone is like 1 billion units per year. It is the largest and most diverse market. We use smartphones for everything, and the key to good AI is data. I don't think any other device will be as important for AI as the smartphone for the foreseeable future.

The back of the Nothing smartphone is transparent and features a “glyph interface” with glowing LEDs.

And how do you see smartphone use evolving in that time?

It will change dramatically. I believe that in the future, the entire phone will only have one app—and that will be the OS. The OS will know its user well and will be optimized for that person.

However, we need to pay close attention to user privacy. We need transparency in how data is handled and clarity about whether it resides in the cloud or is stored on the device. Users must also be able to control who has access to their data, and of course, they must be able to delete it.

The next step after data-driven personalization, in my opinion, is automation. That is, the system knows you, knows who you are, and knows what you want. For example, the system knows your situation, time, place, and schedule, and it suggests what you should do.

Right now, you have to go through a step-by-step process of figuring out for yourself what you want to do, then unlocking your smartphone and going through it step by step. In the future, your phone will suggest what you want to do and then do it automatically for you. So it will be agentic and automated and proactive.

The ultimate benefit to the user is that they will spend less time doing boring things and more time on what they care about. But to get there, we need to take it one step at a time. At this point, if we said, “We have eliminated apps from smartphones,” no one would buy it.

So we have to ship a little bit, look at the data, look at the feedback, iterate, and then ship again. Gradually make suggestions over and over again. We could do this quicker, but we need to bring the user with us on the journey.

Carl Pei says that in product development, it is important to move slowly and listen to feedback.

How long do you think it will take to realize such a vision?

I would say seven to 10 years. I think many people would like to see it happen sooner, but in reality I think people love using apps, so I don't think it will happen that fast.

What kind of company will Nothing be by then, and what kind of products will it offer?

At that point, the OS will be fairly mature and connected to all the important devices. And I think there will be more forms of hardware that are important to users.

The market for smart glasses is very small at this point, but seven years from now it will be a big category. There might be other product areas that will catch on, but we are researching which product categories to start planning for.

And hopefully, on an emotional level, we can also offer something to the world, because the last few years have not been very positive. All the companies that were once creative are now big corporations, everyone is afraid of AI, the economy is bad. There's war. In the midst of all this, I hope that we can bring some positivity and inspiration to the world.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Businesses Got Squeezed by Trump's Tariffs. Now Some of Them Want Their Money Back","https://www.wired.com/story/tariffs-trump-refund-logistics/","Tue, 27 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

As the chief merchandising officer for one of the largest sellers on Amazon, Owen Carr knew that the deck chairs he ordered from a Chinese factory in early April would cost him more than ever before. That's because the chairs, which normally go for $79 on Amazon, were among the first Chinese imports subject to minimum tariffs of 145 percent—a sky-high rate imposed by President Donald Trump—when they arrived at a port in Seattle in late April. “I was paying more to customs than to the factory for the good itself,” Carr says. “Mind boggling.”

Now his company, Spreetail, is part of a narrow class of importers asking whether the Trump administration might provide a refund. On May 12, Trump reached a 90-day trade-war truce with China, cutting the minimum China tariffs to just 30 percent. The higher rate was in effect barely a month, from April 10 through May 14. “We did think there would be an agreement, but we didn't think it would be that fast and that low,” Carr says.

A handful of trade attorneys who spoke with WIRED say they have told clients that refunds are unprecedented and unlikely—but not impossible. Businesses that had to pay the higher rate believe they were unfairly ensnared in Trump's hasty negotiations. “There's still a chance” of refunds, says Michael Roll, a partner at Roll & Harris. “I wouldn't say there's hope. I wouldn't bet on that.”

Trump, Congress, or the courts would have to authorize a new tariffs exemption for companies caught up in the trade deal for refunds to become a reality. Attorneys say their clients have been lobbying the Trump administration and lawmakers for exemptions, including retroactive measures that would result in money back. It's not a frivolous request. Companies that make cars, chips, and drugs have been spared from other tariff policies.

US Customs and Border Protection, which administers tariffs and exemptions, did not respond to a request for comment about the possibility of refunds.

Trump views his trade policies as crucial to increasing US manufacturing and gaining power over China. But his moves are beginning to erode the prices and product selection long familiar to US consumers, according to retail data and experts. Giving 115 percent back to merchants who paid the higher tariff rate would help avert further price increases and allow them to stay afloat if Trump renews tariff hikes, attorneys say. “For all but the most profitable and largest companies, this has been devastating,” says Ron Oleynik, a partner at law firm Holland & Knight.

Paying higher tariffs even once can have long-term consequences for small to midsize companies, attorneys say. US rules require importers to hold a bond—effectively insurance—so that the government can claim at least some funds from companies that flout the law and don't pay what they owe. The level of insurance required is determined by a business' total tariff payments over the past 12 months; as coverage requirements rise, so do the overall costs of the bond. “I have heard this is going to kill us if we have to up our bonds,” Oleynik says.

Companies such as Spreetail recognized the risks of importing goods after Trump imposed a 125 percent tariff on Chinese imports last month. Many businesses decided against placing new orders, and others quickly halted shipments that were in progress. But Carr says Spreetail wanted to support its suppliers, who might otherwise have had to shut down factories as orders tumbled. He also felt confident that he could raise prices enough to make new imports financially worthwhile.

Spreetail ended up paying elevated rates on the deck chairs and about 200 other products out of the 20,000 it imports, which include Razor scooters, ChargePoint EV chargers, and Sterilite boxes, Carr says. It paid rates as high as 190 percent after accounting for item-specific tariffs. “We will not be able to get those dollars back,” Carr adds, perhaps resigned to the limited prospect of refunds.

Companies have managed to get some money back. Products that were in transit when the higher tariff rate went into effect were exempted from having to pay it. But some of the initial bills importers received didn't reflect that. A straw-hat importer, who didn't provide their name when asked in a series of direct messages on Reddit, tells WIRED that they successfully wrangled for an exemption and brought their tariffs rate to about 61 percent from an initially feared nearly 177 percent—though the rate is still double the 31.5 percent they paid in 2023.

Though the lobbying push in Washington, DC, is moving forward, better luck may come from judges. Several lawsuits brought by businesses and states have alleged that Trump lacked the authority to impose recent tariffs such as those on Chinese imports. Some initial rulings are possible within days, but final decisions and any resulting refunds may be years away. Oregon attorney general Dan Rayfield, who is leading one of the cases, says that if he wins, the federal government must give back “every cent of the illegal tariffs collected.”

If the court cases fail, then businesses could resort to a last-minute plea in about 16 months, which is generally the deadline to protest import bills. Mark Tallo, a partner at law firm Sandler, Travis & Rosenberg, says he's telling clients to keep their ledgers open. “Wait until month 15,” he says. There might just be a new ray of hope.

Apple's AirPods Pro are crazy popular for good reason (8/10, WIRED Recommends), from their airy design to their raft of advanced features and powerful noise canceling. But the best AirPods Pro alternatives provide something Apple's pricey flagship buds don't: serious versatility outside Apple's carefully controlled ecosystem. If you're looking for earbuds with that AirPods Pro vibe that travel better beyond the walls of the Apple castle (God forbid you own an Android!), we've got you covered.

My colleagues and I have tested hundreds of pairs of earbuds over the years, and these are the best AirPods Pro alternatives we've come across. From affordable noise cancelers to sporty Beats buds, there's something for everyone here. For more options, check out our Best Wireless Earbuds, Best Wireless Headphones, and Best Noise-Canceling Headphones guides.

How does WIRED define AirPods Pro alternatives?

They're are a lot of traits that spell out Apple's most popular pair, but their conveniently grabbable, stem-style design is a good start. Most of the pairs on our list share this Apple-pioneered form factor. Others, like the hook-shaped Powerbeats Pro 2, channel the AirPods Pro in a different way, offering Apple-friendly features like Find My and the ability to auto-swap between iCloud devices, while joining our other options with Android-friendly features to cater to the other side of the mobile aisle.

Like the AirPods Pro, each model we chose offers noise canceling and transparency mode, and unlike Apple's standard AirPods, they all provide swappable ear tips for a good seal and a stable fit. As with all our earbuds guides, sound quality, features, comfort, battery life, and convenient controls were all major factors in our decision process. Price and overall value also factored heavily to provide good options for those who can't stretch to premium pricing.

What about regular AirPods?

Apple's standard AirPods (5/10, WIRED Review) are a different animal than most other earbuds we test. Their plastic shells provide a semi-open fit, rather than the sealed fit offered by earbuds with ear tips available in various sizes. This heavily affects their sound quality and the efficacy of noise-canceling in the most recent option. That leaves them unable to provide performance on par with most buds we test, which is why this list aims toward AirPods Pro alternatives instead.

While it's true that some folks swear by the standard AirPods' semi-open design, we generally point folks to options with better performance, more features, and a customizable fit, whether that's the AirPods Pro or their many rivals. If you're looking for a more relaxed fit that's less plugged up, our list of the best open earbuds has a variety of options that keep your ears fully open and aware of your environment.

Nothing

Amazon

Nothing

The Nothing Ear (a) (8/10, WIRED Recommends) serve up a sweet blend of style, sound quality, and usability at a surprisingly low price. Their AirPods Pro form factor is bolstered by Nothing's unmistakable aesthetic in both the buds and case for a pair that feels at once recognizable and wholly different. You'll find a customizable EQ, excellent touch controls, and solid noise canceling, though battery life takes a hit at just 5.5 hours per charge with the feature engaged. Still, that's nearly on par with Apple's pricier pair, adding up to sterling value with style for miles.

Bose

Amazon

Bose

Bose's flagship buds (8/10, WIRED Recommends) provide AirPods style in a chunkier package, but that extra heft supports the best noise canceling we've ever tested in a pair of earbuds. There's plenty more to these buds, including clear and focused sound with excellent instrumental separation, adaptable transparency mode to keep your ears safe while staying environmentally aware, and advanced features like spatial audio with head tracking for deeper sonic immersion. These are the priciest pair on this list, but if you need serious sound killers, they're the best in the biz.

Beats

Amazon

Walmart

Best Buy

Apple

The second coming of Beats' Powerbeats Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is truly a best-of-both-worlds option. You'll get all the best Apple features like Find My support, iCloud device switching, and one-touch iOS pairing, in a workout-ready design. Unlike the AirPods Pro, the Powerbeats have a dedicated Android app for features like one-touch pairing and customization. The controls are touchy when inserting the buds, but otherwise convenient thanks to both a multi-key and volume rocker.

In true Beats fashion, the sound is brash treble and bassy, but with plenty of nuance, while advanced noise canceling and natural-sounding transparency mode help them adapt to your environment. Some users complain that the heartbeat monitor is inaccurate, but it worked well enough for me, and it's especially useful for Android devices. Their new hook design is another upgrade, offering supreme comfort and stability to make these among the best workout buds you can buy.

Soundpeats

Amazon

Soundpeats

There are a lot of great-sounding AirPods-style earbuds, but few can compete with these unassuming AirPod clones from Soundpeats for the money. That's because of their hybrid design that pairs a special xMEMs solid-state driver for the top frequencies with a traditional dynamic driver for the bass. The result is sweet, lyrical detail and smooth, punctual bass that earned the pair a perfect 10/10 review score from WIRED editor Parker Hall. I found the touch controls a little unresponsive, and their noise canceling is just OK, but otherwise, there's hardly a bad word to say about a pair this accomplished for the money.

Anker

Amazon

Soundcore

Soundcore has a knack for great sound and value, and the Liberty 4 NC embody that philosophy brilliantly. They've got tight and detailed sound, very good noise canceling for the money, and a laundry list of features, including some you might not expect at this price, like spatial audio. Not every feature is on par with the more premium AirPods Pro, but you'll get some options Apple's pair doesn't offer, like fully customizable controls and a multiband EQ to tailor the experience as you see fit. Not for nothing, the white colorway looks pretty close to Apple's top pair from a distance.

I've thoroughly enjoyed leveling up my espresso machines over the years. My first was the De'Longhi Dedica Arte, a great beginner espresso machine that doesn't break the bank and has lasted me for well over 10 years.

Still, I'm excited about the new wave of espresso machines on the market and have had the pleasure to test a few of them over the past couple of years, like the uber-tech-forward Terra Kaffe TK-02 and the more straightforward De'Longhi Magnifica Start. Cappuccinos are my preferred coffee drink, and while I enjoy nerding out about my coffee with scales and temperature-based electric kettles, sometimes I want a machine to do the hard, technical work for me, like the new Ninja Luxe Cafe Premier Series Espresso Machine.

I usually have mixed feelings about equipment under the Ninja brand, which is often known for trying to do too much at once, but this machine is impressive. The Luxe Cafe machine comes with a lot of tricks up its sleeve and, even though it's semiautomatic and therefore doesn't do all the espresso work for you—it still has a traditional portafilter, for instance—it feels like having a coffee shop right in your home. I've been using it consistently for the past two months and it's incredibly user-friendly, offering the ability to create almost every coffee drink imaginable, from your usual espresso-based drinks to a traditional drip, cold brew, plus the ability to froth a cold foam.

Combine this with the extremely beginner-friendly aspects like a built-in scale that doses coffee grinds for you and the ability to recommend a grind size based on your last drink's performance, and it's an undeniable feat of an espresso machine. It does a lot, and does most of it well.

There are some aspects in which the Ninja feels overengineered, but for the relatively cheap(er) price of around $600, it's a solid investment, especially considering that one of Ninja's main competitors with this machine is the Breville Barista Express ($700).

As far as pulling espresso goes, the Ninja Luxe holds its own, with a stainless steel portafilter that fits two baskets—one for a double shot and a deeper, quad-size basket for traditional coffee drinks and cold brew. (That's right, no single shots available on this machine.) A nine-bar pressure system uses a stepped and lower-pressure pre-infusion mode and comes programmed with the usual espresso ratios: 1:2, 1:2.5, and 1:3.

Along with espresso, the Luxe can brew a traditional cup of coffee (from 6 to 18 ounces) and, in a process that takes about 10 minutes, also make a cold brew. There's some customizability, like choosing between Classic and Rich for your drip coffee or brewing it over ice. There's even an option to get your espresso cold-pressed. All of these are available on the fairly intuitive interface. Depending on which drink option you choose, the machine's built-in grinder will scale it out for you.

Pulling espresso is a fairly hands-on process—you grind, tamp, and insert the portafilter into the group head—but the Luxe's grinder and scale offer some help along the way to make the process more consistent.

The built-in grinder and scale are without a doubt the Luxe's most impressive qualities and include intuitive technology that's great for beginners. The grinder uses a conical burr system and has 25 settings. When you insert the portafilter into the grinder, the machine will read the basket you've chosen. Based on your drink choice, it'll recommend a grind size. Once you adjust the grind size, the Luxe will scale the proper dose of coffee grinds for you. Yes, the Luxe doses by weight, taking much of the guesswork out of the coffee-making process.

All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.

Based on how the previous espresso shot performs, the interface recommends the next drink's grind size. If the shot pulls too slow, it recommends a larger grind size. Too fast, and it recommends a smaller grind. Relying on this in the beginning was finicky and I had to pull quite a few bitter shots before I received a decent one, more than I expected when I was initially calibrating the Luxe to my beans. While it's been fairly solid since, occasionally I'll get an inconsistent shot and not know what changed. Those who like to get their coffee down to a science may not enjoy relying on the Luxe's “barista technology” to this extent, and it was something I had to get used to myself.

I really, really appreciate Ninja's take on the Luxe's milk steaming system. Some automatic espresso machines incorporate a container of milk that has to be brought back and forth from the refrigerator, like the ones from this list. The Luxe, however, keeps it classic with a pitcher that you simply add milk to and a wand that begins steaming at the press of a button, another reason why it's great for those who want barista-quality coffee drinks without all the guesswork.

You can manually steam milk if you so choose, or you can steam milk to four programmed settings, and this includes a cold foam. There's also a setting for a plant-based option, and the Luxe adjusts automatically to this. I had little to no issues with this milk frother and enjoyed the opportunity to practice some latte art, even if the pitcher's spout isn't ideal for it.

The Luxe has a removable hopper and rapid heat-up time, which are fantastic. To the left of the machine is where much of your coffee's assembly happens. Before you grind your coffee, you'll place a funnel on the portafilter to keep it in place. Unfortunately, after a couple months of use, the funnel's plastic corners are chipping.

When not in use, there's a designated spot for the funnel on the left side of the machine alongside the pressure-click tamper. I really like this tamper, as tamping is something I often overthink (Am I creating enough pressure? Do I have an even surface?), and the Luxe's is designed for you to apply the ideal amount of pressure.

The water reservoir doesn't come with a filter, unfortunately. As for the drip tray, it's easy to remove and clean. An orange notch pops up when the tray needs to be emptied. On average, I empty the drip tray every four to five drinks. A handful of times the machine has leaked, even with the drip tray being empty.

A shelf allows the Luxe to accommodate your 2-ounce espresso shots but can be removed to allow room for a travel mug as large as 18 ounces. One common gripe about the Luxe is that despite the portafilter having two spouts, there is not enough room to accommodate two espresso cups on the shelf or drip tray, which is strange. However, one of the biggest misses on this machine is that there's no hot water spout, something I particularly enjoyed with a machine like the De'Longhi Magnifica Start.

My beef with many Ninja kitchen appliances is that sometimes they try to do too much, like the cooler with an added “frost vault.” The Ninja Luxe Cafe feels different, however, considering how intentional it was in competing with other new-age espresso machines. Pulling espresso is solid and, while occasionally inconsistent, delivers an overall smooth and robust shot. The drip coffee was good, not great, and the cold brew can be bitter since it uses the room-temperature water from the filter.

Like many Ninja products, the machine sits in a weird space. A coffee purist may choose a straightforward machine without all the assists of the Luxe, while a true beginner may not feel comfortable investing in the Luxe's “all-in-one” style. Nevertheless, it's an overall quality piece of equipment at a fair price that makes me view the Ninja brand with respect when it comes to its coffee game.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","A New Study Reveals the Makeup of Uranus' Atmosphere","https://www.wired.com/story/a-new-study-reveals-the-makeup-of-uranus-atmosphere/","Tue, 27 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Uranus, the seventh planet in the solar system, located between Saturn and Neptune, has long been a mystery. But by analyzing observations made by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope over a 20-year period, a research team from the University of Arizona and other institutions has provided new insights into the composition and dynamics of the planet's atmosphere.

Information about Uranus is limited. What we know is that the planet is composed mainly of water and ammonia ice, its diameter is about 51,000 kilometers, about four times that of the Earth, and its mass is about 15 times greater than Earth's. Uranus also has 13 rings and 28 satellites.

In January 1986, NASA's Voyager 2 space probe successfully completed what has been, to date, the only exploration of the planet, conducting a flyby as part of its mission to study the outer planets of the solar system.

This image of Uranus was taken by NASA's Voyager 2 space probe in January 1986.

But thanks to this new research, we now know a little more about this icy giant. According to the research, which assessed Hubble images take between 2002 and 2022, the main components of Uranus' atmosphere are hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of methane and very small amounts of water and ammonia. Uranus appears pale blue-green because methane absorbs the red component of sunlight.

This image of Uranus, taken by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, shows nine of the planet's 28 satellites and its rings.

The research has also shed light on the planet's seasons.

Unlike all of the other planets in the solar system, Uranus' axis of rotation is almost parallel to its orbital plane. For this reason, Uranus is said to be orbiting in an “overturned” position, as shown in the picture below. It is speculated that this may be due to a collision with an Earth-sized object in the past.

Uranus orbiting the sun. It can be seen that Uranus' axis of rotation is almost parallel to its orbital plane.

The planet's orbital period is about 84 years, which means that, for a specific point on the surface, the period when the sun shines (some of spring, summer, and some of fall) lasts about 42 years, and the period when the sun does not shine (some of fall, winter, and some of spring) lasts for about 42 years as well. In this study, the research team spent 20 years observing the seasons.

These images of Uranus were taken by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope using its Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS).

Over that period, the research team watched as the south polar region darkened going into winter and the north polar region brightened as summer approached. By observing the planet at four different points in time, years apart, they could see how the gradual shifting of the seasons affected the planet. The top row shows how the planet appeared when viewing it with just visible light.

The second row from the top is a pseudo-color image based on visible-light and near-infrared observations. Green indicates less methane in the atmosphere than blue, and red indicates the absence of methane. The lower levels of atmospheric methane at the poles (which, remember, are on the planet's sides rather than its top and bottom) indicate that there is little seasonal variation in methane levels. In the left-most image on this row, the green-colored south pole is moving into darkness. In the other three images, the green, lower-methane region of the north pole can be seen coming into view. (The fourth row shows the same lack of methane variation, but without coloration.)

But what about the third row? This shows estimates of aerosol abundance, using visible light and infrared images that haven't been colored. The light areas are cloudy with high aerosol abundance, and the dark areas are clear with low aerosol abundance. What is noteworthy in these images is that there is seasonal variation. The arctic region was clear at the beginning of spring (in 2002), but became cloudy as summer progressed (2012 through 2022). Conversely, the antarctic region appears to have cleared as fall progressed into winter. The team believes that these seasonal changes are evidence that sunlight changes levels of aerosol mist on the planet.

Although the results of this study cover a long 20-year period, this still only reflects one period of seasonal change in Uranus' atmosphere. The research team will continue to observe Uranus as the polar regions move into news seasons, to gather more data.

Nielsen's latest report serves as another wake-up call that YouTube is rapidly gaining ground in the TV landscape.

On Tuesday, Nielsen released its April 2025 “Media Distributor Gauge” report, which showed that YouTube has achieved a significant milestone: it has maintained the largest share of TV viewing for three consecutive months, now accounting for 12.4% of total audience time spent watching television. 

This marks a significant uptick from 12% the previous month and an even more notable increase from just 9.6% a year ago.

The new data underscores YouTube's continued dominance in the living room, beating top media companies such as Disney, Paramount, and Netflix. Disney held the second-largest share of TV viewing in April, with 10.7% of the total.

Additionally, according to internal data from YouTube, TVs were the primary device for YouTube viewing in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2025.

Plus, YouTube's share of TV viewing is poised for additional growth. During its annual Upfront event for advertisers earlier this month, the company announced a significant deal with the NFL. This agreement will see YouTube exclusively stream the first Friday game of the season to a global audience, marking the first time the platform has been a live broadcaster for NFL games.

Salesforce has acquired cloud data management firm Informatica in an $8 billion equity deal, marking a major move in its push to strengthen its AI and data infrastructure capabilities.

The announcement, made Tuesday, comes about a year after early rumors of the acquisition sent both companies' stock prices sliding. At the time, Informatica denied it was for sale, but a lot can change in a year. 

Under the terms of the deal, Salesforce will pay $25 in cash per share for Informatica's Class A and Class B-1 common stock, adjusting for its prior investment in the company.

Informatica was founded in 1993 and works with more than 5,000 customers across more than 100 countries. The company had a $7.1 billion market cap at the time of publication.

This acquisition will help bolster Salesforce's agentic AI ambitions, the company's press release stated, by giving the company more data infrastructure and governance to help its AI agents run more “safely, responsibly, and at scale across the modern enterprise.”

“Together, we'll supercharge Agentforce, Data Cloud, Tableau, MuleSoft, and Customer 360, enabling autonomous agents to act with intelligence, context, and confidence across every enterprise,” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in the press release. “This is a transformational step in delivering enterprise-grade AI that is safe, responsible, and deeply integrated with the world's data.”

The path to this deal began in April 2024, when reports surfaced that Salesforce was eyeing Informatica. The market reaction was swift — both companies' shares dipped on fears of a difficult integration or strategic mismatch. Informatica later issued a public statement denying any sale discussions. But what once seemed unlikely is now official.

Informatica isn't the first data management company Salesforce has acquired in the past year. In September, Salesforce snapped up Own Company for $1.9 billion in cash.

“Data security has never been more critical, and Own's proven expertise and products will enhance our ability to offer robust data protection and management solutions to our customers,” Salesforce general manager Steve Fisher said in a press release at the time.

TechCrunch has reached out to Salesforce for more information.

Tesla sales in Europe and the U.K. have fallen by nearly half, according to data released Tuesday by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. In April, Tesla sold 7,261 vehicles in the European Union, European Free Trade Association, and U.K., a 49% year-over-year decline.

The fall in sales is particularly alarming considering Tesla recently launched a new Model Y vehicle, the kind of release that would typically attract more consumers. A closer look at car sales in the region shows that Tesla competitors have not experienced the same decline, suggesting that CEO Elon Musk's political activities and alignment with U.S. President Donald Trump have had an outsized effect on the brand.

Tesla sales have struggled for months globally. Tesla recorded 336,681 deliveries, its worst quarterly performance in more than two years. That dip in sales came as Musk led DOGE, the “advisory body” that laid off thousands of federal employees and attempted to eliminate entire agencies and programs. His involvement in the government has proven so unpopular that Musk publicly stated he would refocus his efforts back on Tesla.

In April, new car registrations in the EU, U.K., and EFTA countries like Sweden and Norway fell 0.3 percent to 1,077,186 units year-over-year, with the gas and diesel vehicles seeing the largest declines.

EV sales still make up a smaller share of the overall market but continue to see growth. EV sales grew 27.8% to 184,685 vehicles in April compared to the same month in 2024. Hybrids, meanwhile, had the biggest jump with a 31% uptick in sales.

Meanwhile, figures released last week from market research firm Jato Dynamics shows Chinese manufacturers like BYD gaining ground despite tariffs by the EU. Registrations of EVs made by Chinese automakers in April rose by 59% year on year, reaching almost 15,300 units, according to Jato Dynamics.

Mark your calendars: June 18 just became a can't-miss event. We're thrilled that Ali Partovi and Russell Kaplan will be joining us for what's shaping up to be a fantastic night of ideas and conversation in the heart of Silicon Valley at our next StrictlyVC evening, taking place in Menlo Park.

Partovi, the longtime investor and former operator who's making serious waves with Neo, will take the stage to discuss his ambitious mission that's giving Y Combinator a run for its money. Neo isn't just another platform and fund; it's a systematic approach to identifying up-and-coming engineering and leadership talent before the rest of Silicon Valley even knows they exist. If anyone understands how to spot the next generation of tech titans, it's Partovi.

Joining him will be Russell Kaplan, president of Cognition, the buzzy coding assistant company that was recently valued at $4 billion and that counts Neo among its first backers. This pairing offers a rare glimpse into the investor-founder dynamic in real time, especially as Cognition enjoys some of the ups and downs of earlier startups on an accelerated timeline. (Such is the life of today's AI startups!)

They'll be joined by Baiju Bhatt, the Robinhood co-founder who's now channeling his fintech expertise into something entirely different as founder and CEO of Aetherflux — a move that clearly has investors excited. The San Carlos, California-based startup, which came out of stealth last October and aims to eventually launch a constellation of low Earth orbit satellites that can collect and transmit solar energy directly to “ground stations,” closed on $50 million in Series A funding last month.

These conversations matter because they bridge the gap between big ideas and real-world impact, turning abstract concepts into actual companies and products. That's exactly why StrictlyVC exists: to bring thought leaders into closer contact with the investors, founders, and news junkies who want to understand how tech is reshaping everything in real time.

More programming highlights are coming soon, but we wanted to share this news while extending our deep gratitude to Mayfield, the storied early-stage venture firm that's co-hosting this evening with us. It's their partnership that's making this event possible.

The gathering takes place at The Quad in the center of Sand Hill Road, the perfect backdrop for a night of essential conversations, and plenty of networking — plus drinks and nibbles! (Because the best insights often happen in the spaces between the formal programming.) Stay tuned for more speaker announcements. This is shaping up to be an evening you won't want to miss. Register here before your seat is taken.

Hyperscalers and data center developers are in a pickle: They all want to add computing power tomorrow, but utilities frequently play hard to get, citing years-long waits for grid connections.

“All the AI data centers are struggling to get connected,” Amit Narayan, founder and CEO of Gridcare, told TechCrunch. “They're so desperate. They are looking for solutions, which may or may not happen. Certainly not in the five-year timelines they cite.”

That has led many data centers to pursue what's called “behind the meter” power sources — basically, they build their own power plants, a costly endeavor that hints at just how desperate they are for electricity.

But Narayan knew there was plenty of slack in the system, even if utilities themselves haven't discovered it yet. He has studied the grid for the last 15 years, first as a Stanford researcher then as a founder of another company. “How do we create more capacity when everyone thinks that there is no capacity on the grid?” he said.

Narayan said that Gridcare, which has been operating in stealth, has already discovered several places where extra capacity exists, and it's ready to play matchmaker between data centers and utilities.

Gridcare recently closed an oversubscribed $13.5 million seed round, the company told TechCrunch. The round was led by Xora, Temasek's deep tech venture firm, with participation from Acclimate Ventures, Aina Climate AI Ventures, Breakthrough Energy Discovery, Clearvision, Clocktower Ventures, Overture Ventures, Sherpalo Ventures, and WovenEarth.

For Narayan and his colleagues at Gridcare, the first step to finding untapped capacity was to map the existing grid. Then the company used generative AI to help forecast what changes might be implemented in the coming years. It also layers on other details, including the availability of fiber optic connections, natural gas, water, extreme weather, permitting, and community sentiment around data center construction and expansion. 

“There are 200,000-plus scenarios that you have to consider every time you're running this study,” Narayan said.

To make sure it's not running afoul of regulations, Gridcare then takes that data and weighs it against federal guidelines that dictate grid usage. Once it finds a spot, it starts talking with the relevant utility to verify the data.

“We'll find out where the maximum bang for the buck is,” Narayan said.

At the same time, Gridcare works with hyperscalers and data center developers to identify where they are looking to expand operations or build new ones. “They have already told us what they're willing to do. We know the parameters under which they can operate,” he said.

That's when the matchmaking begins.

Gridcare sells its services to data center developers, charging them a fee based on how many megawatts of capacity the startup can unlock for them. “That fee is significant for us, but it's negligible for data centers,” Narayan said.

For some data centers, the price of admission might be forgoing grid power for a few hours here and there, relying on on-site backup power instead. For others, the path might be clearer if their demand helps green-light a new grid-scale battery installation nearby. In the future, the winner might be the developer that is willing to pay more. Utilities have already approached Gridcare inquiring about auctioning access to newfound capacity.

Regardless of how it happens, Narayan thinks that Gridcare can unlock more than 100 gigawatts of capacity using its approach. “We don't have to solve nuclear fusion to do this,” he said.

Update: Corrected spare capacity on the grid to gigawatts from megawatts.

No matter how much experience you have in the kitchen or how much time you are willing to spend cooking, the right appliance can change your world. With the COSORI 9-in-1 air fryer, you can go from amateur to Michelin-starred chef in a few simple steps. This is the kind of kitchen remodeling that instantly makes plain old meals something to write home about without the mess or frustration of traditional cooking.

And because of a last-minute Memorial Day sale at Amazon, this air fryer is now more affordable than ever: for now, you can purchase it for as little as $89, down from its original cost of $119, which is a massive 25% off that is difficult to beat for such a quality product. Even more staggering is its 4.8 out of 5-star rating (acquired via more than 10,000 reviews) which is a near-new record grade for any product on Amazon, let alone a kitchen appliance.

See at Amazon

What is special about the COSORI air fryer is that it is able to deliver professional-grade outputs with minimal effort: Its innovative TurboBlaze Technology uses a 3600 rpm high-speed fan and reaches 450°F so that each meal is crispy outside and juicy inside. Regardless of whether you are roasting, baking, broiling, reheating or even proofing dough, you have excellent, delicious results with every use. The advanced airflow system and precise temperature control mean that side dishes are evenly cooked with textures that rival anything you'd find in a restaurant.

With nine different functions, it's like having an entire kitchen's worth of appliances packed into one compact, stylish device. The 6-quart square basket is both deep and wide and it's easy to prepare family-sized meals in one go while saving valuable counter and storage space. And despite its power, the COSORI air fryer operates at less than 53 decibels—even on the highest fan speed—so your kitchen stays peaceful and quiet.

Perhaps the most seductive feature of air frying is the possibility of healthier meals and the COSORI does not fail on that front either. You can enjoy all your favorite fried foods such as fries, chicken wings or onion rings with up to 95% less oil so you need not feel guilty for indulging in crunchy fried foods. Cleaning is just as hassle-free as cooking, with the nonstick, dishwasher-safe basket and removable accessories.

This Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer is a kitchen necessity that you don't want to miss out on, especially while this final late Memorial Day sale is still available.

If you ever tried to get real work done on a 13-inch laptop while traveling, you probably know the agony: You're hunched over a tiny screen, juggling incessantly between tabs and just hoping you had a bit more space to breathe. That's where a second (portable) screen can be a game-changer on the road, transforming your productivity and comfort overnight. And thanks to a belated Memorial Day sale on Amazon, you can grab the fantastic Anyuse 15.6″ 1080p portable monitor for under $50, down from $69, which is a price that's essentially unheard of for a product like this.

See at Amazon

Normally, portable monitors of this quality land somewhere in the $90 to $140 range and even on sale it's rare to see them go for less than $70. That makes this $49 deal truly stand out. It's not every day you see a full HD, ultra-thin travel monitor go for a price that's almost impulse-buy territory.

This 15.6″ portable monitor features a crisp 1920×1080 full HD resolution for sharp text and vibrant images whether you're working on spreadsheets or streaming your favorite shows. The IPS panel provides a wide 178-degree viewing angle and colors stay true and clear no matter where you're sitting. With HDR support, your visuals get an extra boost in brightness and realism. The screen also includes low blue light technology which helps reduce eye strain and fatigue during long sessions.

Weighing in at only 1.37 pounds and measuring 0.04 inches thick, this Anyuse monitor slips into any backpack or laptop bag effortlessly. The built-in kickstand means you can prop it up anywhere from a small airplane tray table to a hotel desk without needing any extra accessories. It's the kind of device that makes working from anywhere not just possible, but actually pleasant.

This monitor comes with two fully-functional USB-C ports and a mini HDMI port which makes it so convenient to connect to all sorts of devices. Whether you are working with a laptop, MacBook, PC, smartphone, gaming console, just plug and play without any problem. Just make sure your device supports.

This display is also super useful: You can mirror your laptop display for making presentations in meetings, extend your desktop for multitasking or use it as a gaming display. Two built-in speakers also provide decent audio for calls.

If you're tired of being limited by your laptop's small screen when you travel or work on the road, don't hesitate.

The photo clearly shows the board layout, SK Hynix GDDR6, and more.

There's not a lot about the upcoming AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT that remains a mystery after AMD's launch presentation, and its AIB partner boards being displayed all over Computex. However, Slovakia-based tech site HW Cooling recently enjoyed a Gigabyte factory tour, where they managed to snap a nice, clear shot of an upcoming RX 9060 XT graphics card PCB. There are lots of other interesting photos and details, too, if you care to check their full story.



The PCB is accompanied by a typical Gigabyte codename, which in this case is ‘R906XTG.' We reckon that the PCB is therefore from one of Gigabyte's pair of Radeon RX 9060 XT Gaming graphics cards – either the 8GB or 16GB model, we can't tell from the image, and the -16GB or -8GD Gigabyte short code is missing from the model number. Gigabyte has announced four RX 9060 XT SKUs so far. They're all dual-slot triple-fan cards.



Refocusing on the image, we saw the diminutive Navi 44 GPU in the flesh at Computex, so that isn't new, but we can see it here where it should be, flanked by a quartet of GDDR6 memory chips from SK hynix at 12 o'clock and three o'clock. As we don't know whether this is the 8GB or 16GB Gigabyte RX 9060 XT Gaming PCB, we aren't sure whether there are another four VRAM chips installed on the other side of the PCB.

Above and to the right of the central GPU and VRAM area, Gigabyte has placed a single 8-pin power connector. Along the bottom edge is the lauded PCIe 5.0 x16 interface. AMD's decision to feature only three display outputs, as you can see on the left side of this photo, hasn't been warmly welcomed, though.

That's about all we have to say about the surprise photo exposé from HW Cooling. If you are a practical type, more interested in things like performance, availability, and pricing, we only have AMD's cherry-picked performance slides for now, and have been advised of MSRPs of $299 and $349 for the 8GB and 16GB versions of this card, respectively. “Wide availability” is officially touted by AMD for June 5 – a week on Thursday.

Hygon's processor know-how reinforces Sugon's supercomputer smarts.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A highly significant China tech industry merger looks set to go ahead, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP). The Hong Kong-based organ says that the merger plan between chip designer Hygon Information Technology and supercomputer maker Sugon marks “a major move to consolidate two of the leading players in China's computing supply chain.” We may be seeing the forming of a highly impactful vertically integrated supercomputing giant that has blossomed in the shadow of U.S. sanctions.

The proposed deal involves Hygon absorbing Sugon shares in a stock-swap agreement. Should the process complete successfully, with both companies' shares being taken off the open market for up to 10 trading days, the newly consolidated entity will appear on the Shanghai stock exchange.

To give this merger some context, regular Tom's Hardware readers will be aware that Hygon chips leverage the AMD Zen processor architecture. However, the firm says it has moved on from those days. In a recent report we published highlighting an extraordinary Hygon C86-5G, a 128-core, 512-thread CPU with AVX-512 and 16-channel DDR5-5600 support, we quoted a company exec asserting it uses a ""new self-developed microarchitecture” in its latest designs.



Our previous reports on Sugon made clear its existing close relationship with Hygon. In recent years, the supercomputer maker leaned heavily on Hygon x86 chips to develop high-performance platforms. Sugon is backed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, explains the SCMP, and has managed to push China into the “global top three for supercomputing,” it is claimed.

Both Hygon and Sugon are on the U.S. Entity List, which means they can't get direct access to chips from U.S. suppliers such as AMD, Intel, and Nvidia. Naturally, the pairing, in their new clothes, will be treated similarly by U.S. policymakers. However, that will likely be of little concern to the newly formed vertically integrated Chinese supercomputing giant. The U.S. trade measures might have drawn them inexorably together.

Consolidation in the Chinese semiconductor and computing sectors has previously been forecast by analysts. This newly merged company looks like a sure-fire success, with the Chinese political will to build a formidable high-performance computing infrastructure to drive its domestic AI and big data projects.

CXMT just reached peak DDR4 production, but it's now prioritizing DDR5.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Top Chinese DRAM manufacturer ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT) will reportedly phase out DDR4 memory for servers and PCs by the middle of next year. According to Digitimes, the company is making this sudden shift to accommodate the directives of the Chinese Communist Party, especially as Beijing is pushing the country to take the global lead in AI and cloud infrastructure. In line with this, CXMT is also believed to be prioritizing work on HBM technology, targeting validation of its HBM3 chips by late this year.

This announcement caught many in the industry off guard, especially as the company had just begun mass production of DDR4 memory in late 2024. This ramp-up in capacity, paired with aggressive pricing, has caused leading memory manufacturers Micron, Samsung, and SK hynix to end production of DDR3 and DDR4 chips by late 2025.

But as the Chinese government focuses on AI to compete against the U.S.'s technological supremacy, Beijing is likely directing its local tech giants to give their support. Because of this, industry analysts anticipate CXMT issuing an end-of-life notice for its DDR4 as early as the third quarter of this year. Despite that, DD4 supply has seemingly dried up, with some 8 GB chips jumping in price by 150% because of the lack of supply.

The overall market is heading towards DDR5 production to accommodate the demand for newer devices, but a few DDR4 manufacturing lines will remain. DigiTimes Asia says that CXMT will keep making it for GigaDevice to satisfy demand for consumer memory, while Samsung and SK hynix will keep on producing them using 1z-nm nodes. That means they do not require EUV tools, which are better utilized to produce newer chips.

Despite CXMT's success in DDR4 memory, its DDR5 chips reportedly still face some issues. It's been reported that some of its latest samples have failed some tests, with the memory chips becoming unstable when they hit 60 degrees Celsius and up, some 25 degrees lower than the up to 85 degrees Celsius that Samsung chips can operate in. There's also doubt whether CXMT's DDR5 memory would perform as expected in sub-zero temperatures. This likely would not be an issue with most users, though.

China's chip industry could emerge more resilient from U.S. sanctions


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A new report claims that U.S. sanctions and restrictions placed on the semiconductor market to stifle China's growth may actually be fueling a rise in China's own semiconductor industry, building a more resilient ecosystem, and inadvertently accelerating China's ambitions in the market.

As reported by Digitimes, although the U.S. and China have agreed on a 90-day trade agreement to suspend the harshest tariffs between the two nations, ""tensions in the semiconductor sector are escalating.""

Digitimes says the rising temperature has put Taiwan's IC substrate manufacturers operating in China under renewed scrutiny, revealing some doubt about the efficacy of U.S. Sanctions.

As noted by the report, Taiwan's substrate supply chain delivered unexpectedly strong results in Q1 2025. According to Digitimes, a ""stark difference"" in positioning of companies in Taiwan versus China reveals the possibility that ""China's semiconductor ecosystem may be accelerating its rise, even under U.S. restrictions.""

As the report notes, President Trump has jettisoned the Biden administration's tiered chip diffusion rules in favor of a blanket ban on the global use of Huawei's Ascend AI chips and measures to prevent the export of other AI chips to China, a move Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang branded ""a failure.""

The report highlights the contrasting fortunes of Unimicron and Zhen Ding Technology. The former has reported depressed high-end capacity utilization at its China plants as a result of tightened chip restrictions. The world's foremost IC substrate maker has seen a rebound in orders at its Taiwan facilities to offset the slump, but executives remain concerned that escalating sanctions could see a permanent reduction in high-margin business from China's premium electronics sector.

Conversely, Zhen Ding – the case study behind the theory that sanctions are buoying China's chip industry – is reportedly seeing strong momentum in China's domestic markets. It reportedly credits its ""China for China"" strategy (prioritizing local production for local demand) as a key factor behind a 30% YoY revenue increase in its substrate division.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

According to Digitimes, continued increase in China demand could even see Zhen Ding leverage its Taiwan Kaohsiung AI park to meet demand needs, reversing the flow of the supply chain.

The upshot, according to industry observers cited in the report, is that this strong performance points to a ""critical paradox,"" namely, Digitimes says that ""instead of crippling China's semiconductor ambitions, U.S. sanctions may be inadvertently accelerating them,"" with domestic demand and supply chain localization creating a resilient ecosystem that ""that could emerge stronger in the face of adversity.""

The sentiment broadly reflects Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's comments on the ban on AI chip exports recently. As mentioned, he branded the measures a failure, and specifically noted that companies are turning to Nvidia's Chinese rivals to make up for the dearth in U.S.-developed chips like its H20, giving its competitors a leg up rather than stifling the industry.

Recently, a report claimed that Nvidia is planning to launch new Blackwell-based solutions for China towards the end of the year to supersede its banned H20.

ASRock alleges that these problems have been fixed with their latest BIOS release. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A common thread among increasing user reports of failing Ryzen 9000 CPUs was their connection to an ASRock AM5 motherboard. Citing a conversation with the partner at Computex, Tech Yes City has brought to light that ASRock's initial PBO (Precision Boost Overdrive) presets were set too aggressively for initial CPU samples. It is believed these aggressive settings are what ultimately lead to the premature demise of these processors. AMD declined to comment on the story, while ASRock wasn't immediately available.

Earlier this year, reports of failing AMD Ryzen 9000 (Granite Ridge) processors were common on Reddit and other forums. ASRock initially dismissed reports connecting their motherboards to the problem as 'misinformation', all the while supplying a new BIOS to address boot-up and memory compatibility issues. Affected users had no other choice but to RMA their broken CPUs.

According to new details from Tech Yes City, the problem stems from the amperage (current) supplied to the processor under AMD's PBO technology. Precision Boost Overdrive employs an algorithm that dynamically adjusts clock speeds for peak performance, based on factors like temperature, power, current, and workload. The issue is reportedly confined to ASRock's high-end and mid-range boards, as they were tuned far too aggressively for Ryzen 9000 CPUs.

ASRock believes their settings for the Electric Design Current (EDC) and Thermal Design Current (TDC) were set overly high for early CPU samples. Does this imply initial silicon was less stable than what we're getting now? It's hard to say. ASRock reportedly ruled out memory incompatibility and excessive SoC voltages as potential causes, the latter of which has a history of wrecking last-generation Ryzen 7000 (Raphael) CPUs.

Liquid coolers and AIOs are said to compound this problem, as they provide greater thermal headroom for PBO. Per the YouTuber, ASRock has fixed this issue with a new BIOS update. While preliminary testing reveals no difference in EDC and TDC values, ASRock has also reportedly reduced ""shadow voltages,"" which are settings not visible to users.

It's still uncertain if the fault lies with AMD or ASRock, as all partners are bound by specific and clear limits set by AMD. Likewise, it is too soon to tell if this fix is truly effective, but we'll know for sure if more cases surface. Questions also emerge from ASRock's media representative initially dismissing user reports as 'misinformation'. It's unlikely to be a coincidence when reports of the same issue point to motherboards from one specific manufacturer. While we've requested further comment on the matter, ASRock should release a public advisory urging users to update their BIOS to prevent potential failures, if that indeed is the necessary fix.

Demand for high-performance, high-capacity storage devices is growing, and to meet it, manufacturers sometimes go to rather extreme ways. Take a look at Utran Technology, which introduced a PCIe 5.0 x16 add-in card at Computex that packs 28 M.2 NVMe SSDs offering read and write throughput of 109 GB/s and storage capacity of up to 224 TB.



At the heart of the device is the Broadcom PEX89144 — a 144-lane PCIe 5.0 switch to manage connectivity and bandwidth distribution across all drives — that enables simultaneous access to all 28 SSDs through a PCIe x16 slot and two x8 cables. Such a topology enables the unit to bypass typical lane and slot limitations while maintaining physical compatibility with all systems supporting full height full length (FHFL) cards.

As far as performance concerns, the card (well, rather a system) delivers an aggregate sequential read throughput of over 109,600 MB/s (about 109.6 GB/s) and more than 418,000 IOPS, as shown in the Iometer benchmark performed by the company. In addition, the unit has an average I/O response time of just 0.48 milliseconds, highlighting exceptional latencies enabled by the PEX89144 switch.



CPU usage during the test performed by the company hovered around 30%, suggesting headroom for parallel compute tasks or additional I/O operations. This level of performance, combined with a relatively low latency, makes the device quite an appealing choice for a variety of datacenter applications that require both capacity and performance.

The card is, of course, power hungry. Ultran says it can draw about 400W, though we can only wonder from where it draws that power, considering the fact that it only has one eight-pin auxiliary PCIe power connector.

The dense layout and a compact cooling system using a radiator and a high-pressure fan enable the device to work in rack-scale storage deployments, so with eight of such cards, one can store 1.792PB of data. On the one hand, such storage density is not really high, though keeping in mind the very high performance offered by such a storage subsystem, this can make sense for such storage applications.

There are still some things to keep in mind about the card. First up, it is not hot swappable. Secondly, it does not seem that there is power loss protection on the card level, so one must use SSDs with power loss protection on the drive level. Assuming that one uses ATP SSDs that can actually monitor power levels remaining in capacitors, enabling their power loss protection, this may well be quite a reliable storage solution. Furthermore, the drive supports management functions like USB terminal control, which could enable external monitoring or firmware updates. Also, the card is cooled down using a single high-pressure fan. Such fans are widely used in the datacenter industry.

Utran plans to start selling its 28-way M.2 adapter this summer for a rather eye-watering price of around $3,000. Then again, the Broadcom PEX89144 is not a cheap solution.

 May 27, 2025  

On Saturday, May 24, the 78th World Health Assembly (WHA) voted to adopt a resolution to establish a global framework to support the diagnosis and management of rare diseases and promote research in the field. Sponsored by more than 20 countries led by Egypt and Spain, the resolution comes as the culmination of a decade of advocacy by the rare disease community. 

“We see this as a practical step forward; one that recognizes existing gaps and commits member states and the World Health Organization to stronger coordination and inclusive action,” said Her Excellency Hanan Al Kuwari, PhD, advisor to the Prime Minister of Qatar for Public Health Affairs, at a side event of the WHA organized by Rare Diseases International and co-hosted by Medscape and other organizations.

Although most rare diseases are genetic, there are also rare autoimmune diseases, metabolic diseases, infectious diseases, and cancers. Each rare disease is uncommon alone, but when taken together they afflict about 300 million people globally.

The individual rarity of the diseases means that they present a common challenge to health systems, which aren't prepared to address such uncommon cases. They can take a long time to diagnose, even in rich countries. In Europe, it takes an average of 4 years to diagnose a known rare disease. Once diagnosed, it can be difficult to get treatment because of a lack of specialized equipment and expertise, and existing drug treatments are expensive. These problems are amplified in poorer countries, where healthcare systems have access to fewer resources.

The resolution tasks the World Health Organization (WHO) director general with developing a 10-year global action plan to tackle rare diseases. The plan should foster equitable access to diagnosis and treatment, as well as support research and monitoring of rare diseases. The resolution also calls for the director general to identify centers of excellence around the world for clinical work on rare disease groups. A draft global action plan should be prepared for consideration by the 81st World Health Assembly in 3 years.

“The global action plan will give structure, coherence, and momentum to a cause that, for too long, has been fragmented and underfunded,” said Mohamed Hassany, MD, Egypt's assistant minister of health for projects and public health initiatives, at the WHA side event.

“This is a huge and important step forward for the recognition of rare and low-prevalence diseases as a major public health need,” said Claudia Gonzaga-Jauregui, PhD, a geneticist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and a founder of the Collaborative for Rare Diseases in the Caribbean and Latin America (CEPCAL). But change will take time, she told Medscape Medical News.

“Proper implementation of the resolution will take advocacy, changes in current legislation, or new legislation and regulatory frameworks in most countries, as well as development of national health plans,” she said. 

The resolution will help advocacy efforts in countries that have so far ignored rare diseases or put them low on their healthcare agenda. Gonzaga-Jauregui hopes that, in the mid- to long-term, the global action plan will put pressure on local and national governments to develop a rare disease agenda.

Developing a framework for rare diseases won't only help the people living with rare diseases. Many advocates argue that it is a path to equitable, universal healthcare. “If you get it right for the rare disease community, all healthcare systems will benefit,” said Kelly du Plessis, the founder and CEO of Rare Diseases South Africa, while hosting a panel at the WHA side event.

EURORDIS-Rare Diseases Europe, which wasn't involved in the WHA side event, called the adoption of the resolution a historic moment. “It sends a powerful and meaningful signal to policymakers the world over that the health and inclusion of the 300 million people living with a rare disease are now recognized as global priorities. The resolution reinforces the understanding that addressing rare diseases is essential to achieving universal health coverage and to building equitable, people-centered health systems,” Virginie Bros-Facer, CEO of EURORDIS, told Medscape Medical News.

“We commend the leadership of Spain, Egypt, and all co-sponsoring countries, and we thank the WHO for recognizing the challenges faced by people living with a rare or undiagnosed disease,” she added. “EURORDIS stands ready to help shape and implement the Global Action Plan this resolution mandates. Our global community should be proud today, even if the world we want to achieve still lies far ahead.”

Gonzaga-Jauregui and Bros-Facer reported no relevant financial relationships.

Adding mepolizumab to inhaled triple therapy significantly improved exacerbation outcomes compared with placebo in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), based on data from the MATINEE study presented at the American Thoracic Society (ATS) 2025 International Conference.

Based on these findings, mepolizumab is newly approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of COPD according to manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline.

“This decision is good news for patients because it allows more options for care, and it is good news for the future of COPD treatment in that there are now more options showing targets previously not identified that can improve patient outcomes,” said co-author Gerard J. Criner, MD, of the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, in a statement following the approval.

Patients with COPD and type 2 inflammation are at an increased risk for frequent and severe exacerbations that may require hospitalization or emergency department visits, Alberto Papi, MD, of the University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy, and colleagues wrote in their abstract.

Mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-5 (IL-5), significantly reduced COPD exacerbations in patients with COPD regardless of the history or severity of exacerbations in a phase 3 study known as MATINEE, the researchers wrote.

In the study, the researchers randomized 804 adults aged 40 years or older with COPD to a subcutaneous dose of 100 mg of mepolizumab every 4 weeks for 52-104 weeks, or a placebo, in addition to the inhaled triple therapy of a fluticasone propionate dose of at least 500 μg/d or the equivalent, plus dual long-acting bronchodilators. Approximately 21% of the patients had a history of severe exacerbations in the past years. The mean age of the participants was approximately 66 years, and at least two thirds were men.

Overall, patients treated with mepolizumab had a 21% reduced annualized rate of moderate to severe exacerbations compared with patients treated with placebo, with rate ratios of 0.75 and 0.79 for subgroups with and without a history of severe exacerbations, respectively.

In addition, patients with a history of severe exacerbations had a 32% reduced rate of exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or hospital stay.

The results were durable as well, the researchers noted. The significant difference in exacerbation rates between patients treated with mepolizumab and those treated with placebo was observed at 1 year and continued for up to 104 weeks of treatment.

The incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events was similar in the mepolizumab and placebo groups, the most common of which was exacerbation of COPD (11% and 15% for serious adverse events in the mepolizumab and placebo groups, respectively).

The researchers were surprised that mepolizumab's significant clinical impact on exacerbation reduction extended to such a broad group of patients with COPD, including those who did or did not have chronic bronchitis, and those with evidence of emphysema, Criner said in an interview. “That mepolizumab could decrease emergency room visits and hospitalization is a significant benefit for patients,” he added.

Mepolizumab made all its primary and key secondary end points with a robust safety profile, said Criner. “Patients with COPD who have type 2 inflammation can benefit from biologic therapy, regardless of the severity of underlying airflow obstruction with or without the absence of chronic bronchitis or emphysema to reduce moderate and severe exacerbations,” he said.

Additional research should target different pathways and patients who have inflammation with COPD, such as types 1 and 3, Criner noted.

“I'm excited to have another option to treat COPD patients who have elevated eosinophils and frequent exacerbations,” said study co-author Meilan Han, MD, of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, in an interview. “I'd like additional research to help us understand which patients experience the best response in terms of lung function and symptoms,” she added.

The approval will change care of patients with COPD who are already maximized on inhaler therapies and continue to have exacerbations, “as this is the only biologic approved for patients with blood eosinophils <= 300 cells/µL,” said Arianne K. Baldomero, MD, a pulmonologist and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, in an interview. “The cost could be prohibitive (annual cost is almost $50,000 per year); so patients should explore insurance coverage, manufacturer assistance programs, nonprofit financial support, and discount cards to reduce their out-of-pocket expenses for mepolizumab,” she said.

“The MATINEE study was important because, despite optimal triple inhaler therapy, many high-risk patients continue to experience frequent COPD exacerbations. This trial evaluated whether adding a new therapy can further reduce exacerbations in this high-risk COPD population,” said Baldomero.

However, as with other biologics, when or whether mepolizumab can be safely discontinued, and whether the risk for COPD exacerbations will return upon stopping remains unclear, said Baldomero. “Additionally, there is limited evidence to guide whether inhaler therapies can be withdrawn while on biologics, and more research is needed to determine optimal treatment duration,” she said.

Several other studies of MATINEE findings were presented at the meeting. In one study, data showed that mepolizumab reduced exacerbations in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities compared with placebo.

Post hoc analyses of data from the MATINEE study also were presented at the meeting to examine the effectiveness of mepolizumab in various subgroups. In one post hoc analysis, patients treated with mepolizumab had lower mean healthcare resource use per exacerbation in terms of emergency department visits, urgent care/outpatient clinic visits, and days in intensive care than patients treated with placebo.

Another analysis of MATINEE study data showed that, compared with placebo, mepolizumab significantly improved exacerbation rates in patients with severely restricted airflow based on the GOLD criteria.

An additional post hoc analysis showed that, compared with placebo, mepolizumab's association with improved exacerbation rates was consistent regardless of duration of COPD.

Mepolizumab has been developed for the treatment of a range of IL-5 mediated diseases associated with type 2 inflammation and is also approved for use in the United States and Europe for severe asthma, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, according to manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline.

The MATINEE study was funded by GlaxoSmithKline.

Criner disclosed receiving consulting fees and research funds from GlaxoSmithKline.

Han disclosed serving as a consultant for GlaxoSmithKline and multiple relationships with pharmaceutical companies outside of the MATINEE study.

Baldomero had no financial conflicts to disclose.

Supplemental imaging techniques could more than triple cancer detection in dense breasts compared with standard care alone, according to new research.

The study, published in The Lancet, found that abbreviated MRI (AB-MRI) and contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) could help detect an additional 3500 breast cancer cases per year in the UK.

Around 2.2 million women undergo breast cancer screening each year in the UK. Approximately 10% have very dense breasts.

Breast density refers to the proportion of glandular and fibrous connective tissue relative to fatty tissue as seen on mammography. Dense breasts contain more glandular and fibrous tissue and less fatty tissue.

Women with the densest breasts have a fourfold higher cancer risk than those with fatty breasts. They are also more likely to receive delayed diagnoses. 

Professor Fiona Gilbert from the Department of Radiology at the University of Cambridge told Medscape News UK that introducing these imaging techniques to routine screenings could save around 700 lives each year.

“Existing research indicates that around one in five cancers detected via screening become life-threatening without intervention,” said Gilbert, who is also honorary consultant radiologist at Addenbrooke's Hospital.

The interim results form part of the BRAID study. It is the first study to compare each imaging technique in women with normal mammograms and dense breast tissue.

Researchers recruited more than 9000 women aged 50-70 years with dense breasts who had received negative mammograms.

Participants were randomly assigned to undergo AB-MRI, automated whole-breast ultrasound (ABUS), CEM, or the current standard of care, full-field digital mammography.

The primary outcome measured detection rate, defined as the percentage of women with positive supplemental imaging results leading to histologically confirmed breast cancer.

AB-MRI detected 17.4 cancer cases per 1000 examinations. CEM detected 19.2 cases per 1000. ABUS detected 4.2 cases per 1000. Of these, 15 per 1000 for AB-MRI, 4.2 for ABUS, and 15.7 for CEM were invasive cancers. Detection rates for AB-MRI and CEM were similar and significantly higher than for ABUS.

Secondary outcomes included the difference in recall rates and tumour characteristics among the arms. Both AB-MRI and CEM had recall rates of 9.7%. ABUS had a 4% recall rate.

Invasive tumours found by AB-MRI and CEM were half the size of those detected by ABUS.

No adverse events occurred in the ABUS group. The AB-MRI group had one case of extravasation but no other adverse events.

The CEM group experienced 24 iodinated contrast events — 17 minor, six moderate, and one severe — and three extravasations.

“There were some adverse reactions to [intravenous] iodine (the contrast agent in CEM), but this is already commonly used (about 40% of CT scans), and these people could still be offered AB-MRI. As such, the fact that there are two options (CEM and AB-MRI) that performed equally well can be a real benefit,” said Gilbert. 

The researchers noted that they could not measure screening benefit and overdiagnosis.

“Some of the detected cancers would not have gone on to become life threatening if left alone,” according to Gilbert, who said that “a future challenge for research is to work out how we can get better at telling the difference between the ones that will become harmful and the ones that won't.”

The cohort will be followed for 3 years to account for possible relapses and interval cancers.

Recall rates for AB-MRI and CEM improved as clinicians became more familiar with analysing the scans. However, care should be taken to minimise these should the supplementary techniques be introduced to population screening, the authors noted. 

According to Gilbert, the study made use of technologies that are already widely available without additional costs or resources. However, she noted that a cost-benefit analysis is needed before the techniques could be integrated into routine screening.

Kotryna Temcinaite, head of research communications and engagement at Breast Cancer Now, called for the research findings to be considered. “If the UK National Screening Committee recommends additional imaging for screening women with very dense breasts, we'll push for those changes to be rolled out as quickly as possible across the UK,” she said.

MINNEAPOLIS — Risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) appears substantially greater in patients with placenta accrete than in other pregnant patients, found a small single-center study presented at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) 2025 Annual Meeting.

Despite the institution having created a specific protocol — a VTE bundle — for patients with placenta accreta, only about one in five patients with placenta accreta received the complete bundle, reported Rinat Tal, of the University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, and colleagues. 

“Patients with placenta accreta spectrum are at risk for massive hemorrhage, need for blood transfusion, massive transfusion, long operating times, general anesthesia, and ICU stay, all of which increased patients' risk for VTE beyond the preexisting elevated risk in pregnancy,” the authors wrote. 

Yet, guidelines do not exist regarding the optimal VTE prophylaxis for patients with placenta accreta, they noted. So, the researchers assessed the effectiveness of a VTE bundle developed at their institution for reducing risk for VTE in patients with placenta accreta.

The Michigan Medicine VTE Bundle included four components: Intraoperative administration of subcutaneous heparin; anticoagulation restarted within 8 hours postoperatively; anticoagulation continued through discharged; and prophylactic anticoagulation prescribed at discharge.

The authors analyzed retrospective data on all scheduled cesarean hysterectomies performed for suspected placenta accreta, excluding patients with cancer and those with incomplete 6-week postpartum data. They identified 90 patients who met their criteria and found that only 22.2% had received the complete VTE bundle.

Incidence of VTE was 2.2% in the cohort: One patient who received the complete bundle and one who did not (P = .34). The groups therefore showed no difference in risk-based receipt of the complete bundle, but the population was likely too small, especially for such a rare outcome, to achieve statistical power in the study. The researchers noted, however, that the incidence of VTE was 18 times higher in this cohort than in pregnant patients generally.

Among the 77.8% of patients with placenta accreta who did not receive the full VTE bundle, 28.5% had a delayed restart of postoperative anticoagulation but otherwise received the other three components of the bundle. However, the other 71.4% were missing anywhere from one to three components, including 5.7% who received no prophylactic anticoagulation. 

The women who did and did not receive the VTE bundle had a similar age, a median 34 years old, and gestational age at delivery was a median 34 weeks. However, the median body mass index of women who received the bundle was 34.7 compared with 31.8 among those receiving incomplete bundles. Also, more of the women receiving an incomplete bundle had a previous C section (92.9%) than those who received the full bundle (80%). 

Median blood loss was greater in those who received an incomplete bundle (2500 mL) than those who received the full bundle (1600 mL), and more women receiving an incomplete bundle (21.4%) had a packed red blood cell transfusion than those who received the full bundle (5%).

The researchers suggested additional research to evaluate the barriers to providing all appropriate patients with the VTE bundle and targeted quality improvement efforts to improve compliance. 

Alison G. Cahill, MD, associate dean of translational research and professor of women's health at The University of Texas at Austin Dell Medical School, told Medscape Medical News that the findings here need to be interpreted cautiously given that it's such a small study and results are only currently available in the poster. Regardless, the question the researchers ask is an important one that should merit investigation, Cahill suggested. 

“We're constantly searching for opportunities to further reduce the chance of VTE in the setting of pregnancy for all kinds of all pregnant people,” Cahill said. This study “raises the question as to whether or not this group [those with placenta accreta] should be considered separately” in seeking more ways to prevent VTE, she said.

“Just the idea of thinking about VTE risk — that there are differences, and what they look like, and how we might approach them differently — is an important investigative lane, especially because a lot of the data that we have for VTE primary prevention is from outside of the obstetric literature,” Cahill said. 

No external funding or disclosures from the authors were reported. Cahill had no disclosures.

The Eurovision Song Contest (ESC), held in Basel, Switzerland, from 10 May to 17 May, 2025, drew approximately 50,000 fans from 80 countries.

As the world's largest music competition, the event drew significant international attention and required meticulous public health planning.

In an interview with El Medico Interactivo, the Public Health Department of Basel-City explained how the medical services were coordinated during the event.

The Eurovision team provided clear guidance to the participants and visitors on how to access medical support, including directions for emergency services, local pharmacies, and healthcare facilities.

According to the Health Department, emergency medical teams were deployed across all ESC venues, including the Main Venue, Arena Plus, Eurovision Villa, EuroClub and Café, and Eurovision Square. These teams consisted of paramedics and trained healthcare professionals to ensure that immediate medical aid was available when needed.

“The concept is straightforward: Emergency service teams serve as the first point of contact. They provide on-site care whenever feasible and help visitors with basic health concerns, advising on how to handle medical emergencies that may require a hospital visit,” officials from the Basel Health Department explained.

Moreover, “in the operational organisation of the ESC, paramedic services and representatives from the Public Health Department of Basel-City collaborated to ensure necessary medical care.”

“The teams use checklists to figure out the most suitable hospital for each case. Overall, we have compiled health tips for international visitors on how best to address health issues in Basel,” they added.

These health tips include information on where and when to seek medical care and recommendations on what to eat and drink to avoid poisoning, alcohol and drug use, and safe sex.

Organisers also warned about the dangers of fake news, particularly concerning health issues during the festival. “It is reassuring that, so far, no medical problems as a result of excessive alcohol or party drug consumption have been encountered.”

A key concern in large events is how the arrival of a large number of visitors may affect local healthcare organisations. Swiss attendees bought the greatest number of tickets, marking that the event had returned to their country for the first time since 1989. Germany ranked second in ticket sales, while fans from the United Kingdom, France, and Spain ranked in the top five. Spain was the third European country most interested in travelling to the host city.

In this context, the Health Department emphasised that “the added burden on the healthcare system caused by ESC visitors has been relatively low so far. We expected and were prepared for a larger burden.”

Regarding the typical work carried out by these specialised medical teams, officials in Basel noted, “one aspect is providing health services to international guests for health issues they would usually consult their family physicians in their home country, such as minor injuries, prescriptions for chronic illnesses.”

In this manner, “the Department of Public Health maintains a daily briefing with major acute care hospitals and the operation managers of security organisations such as police, emergency services, and medical emergency call centres) to ensure information flow and streamline procedures.”

Furthermore, “the focus is on preparing and strengthening the healthcare system, ensuring awareness and ability to manage an increase in patients with (severe) injuries during the event, similar to what might occur in the case of an accident. For this reason, we are part of a “crisis organisation” that will respond if a serious incident.”

However, reports leading up to the grand finale indicate that everything went ahead smoothly. “Fortunately, the event has been calm and only minor cases have been addressed. The most common issues involved injuries requiring medical attention, such as cuts, joint sprains, or pain relief medications for various conditions.”

LOS ANGELES — Spending time in a forest — an experience known as Shinrin-Yoku, or “forest bathing,” in Japan where the practice originated — can lift mood, reduce stress, and promote physical health, a new literature review suggested.

Most of the studies included in the review reported moderate to strong effect sizes, using validated measures such as the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and physiological indicators like blood pressure.

Taking a walk in the forest appears to be beneficial and may have therapeutic potential, said study investigator Donovan Dennis, a third-year medical student at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan. It's something physicians could consider prescribing to their patients, he told Medscape Medical News.

The findings were presented on May 18 at the American Psychiatry Association (APA) 2025 Annual Meeting.

More than half of the world's population lives in urban environments, where managing stress and maintaining a positive mindset during crises can be difficult. Over time, chronic stress can contribute to anxiety and fatigue.

In response, experts are increasingly exploring alternative and holistic approaches to mental well-being, spurring research into the psychological benefits of immersing oneself in nature, particularly forest settings.

Japan has been a leader in this movement. As of 2019, the country had designated approximately 60 official forestry therapy trails.

The review included 15 studies conducted in Japan, the United States, Poland, and several other countries. Study designs varied: One was a meta-analysis, three were systematic reviews, and the remaining 11 were observational studies or randomized experimental models.

Most participants were considered “healthy,” although some studies included individuals “with depressive tendencies,” said Dennis. The study populations also varied by setting — for example, one study focused on healthcare workers, while another involved patients from a psychiatric hospital.

Although all of the studies examined forest bathing, typically defined as walking in a forest, the practice itself lacks a standardized definition, Dennis noted.

Most of the studies involved walking in a forest for about 2 hours, twice a week. However, durations varied — some had participants walk for as little as 10 minutes, while others extended sessions to 3 hours, said Dennis.

In some cases, the intervention was defined by distance rather than time; for example, one study involved a 2.5-km walk, and another covered 4 km.

The overall length of the studies also varied, ranging from a few weeks to several months.

Researchers examined both psychological and physiological effects of forest bathing. While most studies used POMS to assess mood, several also measured physiological markers such as serotonin levels, blood pressure, and heart rate, Dennis noted.

The analyses generally showed positive effects of forest therapy on mental health, with some studies also reporting benefits for the cardiovascular and immune systems, as well as improvements in inflammation and antioxidant activity.

“Forest therapy might be therapeutic for folks living with depression or anxiety, but also preventatively to support general wellness, and connectedness with nature,” said Dennis.

However, the review did not clarify the role of factors such as frequency, duration, or seasonality in shaping the benefits of forest therapy, Dennis noted.

While the findings are promising, they do not support forest therapy as a replacement for pharmacological treatment. Larger, well-controlled studies with standardized protocols are needed to confirm its benefits, he said.

Commenting on the research for Medscape Medical News, Environmental Psychologist Sabine Huemer, PhD, assistant professor, School of Psychological Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, said she was surprised but pleased that forest therapy was discussed at a psychiatry conference.

Huemer said she initially believed that psychiatry remained rooted in traditional therapy and medical treatments but now recognizes that the field is expanding to include alternative approaches such as psychedelic-assisted therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and ecotherapy or nature therapy.

Huemer pointed to resources like Park Rx America, which encourage physicians to prescribe time in nature as part of routine healthcare. In Japan, doctors often prescribe forest therapy to stressed businesspeople as a way to “recharge and recover,” she noted.

An eco-therapist herself, Huemer has developed a “mindfulness in nature” program aimed at reducing stress and promoting mental well-being, that draws on the principles of Shinrin-Yoku.

Although the review did not include original data and was based on a limited number of studies, it highlights the rejuvenating effects of nature, Huemer said. She noted that these benefits apply not only to adults but also to children, many of whom are spending less time outdoors.

Huemer and her colleagues have been studying eco-anxiety among US college students. Eco-anxiety — defined as worry about the future of the planet — primarily affects members of Generation Z and younger cohorts, those born in the mid-to-late 1990s, she said. It can interfere with daily functioning and sleep, and often leads to intrusive, recurring thoughts.

Their research, presented in a poster at the APA 2025 Annual Meeting, showed that higher levels of eco-anxiety were associated with personal experiences of climate change and a prior diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder.

Interestingly, and in contrast to findings from other studies, they did not find that collective activism — such as participation in environmental clubs — served as a buffer against eco-anxiety.

Also commenting on the forest bathing review, Umadevi Naidoo, MD, an instructor in the Department of Psychiatry, Division of Nutrition at Harvard Medical School and Director of Nutritional and Lifestyle Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said she was “happy to see a poster on forest bathing,” noting that it aligns with the focus on lifestyle interventions at the APA 2025 annual meeting.

She noted that forest medicine is gaining acceptance as an additional lifestyle option for patients.

Naidoo, who is often referred to as “America's Nutritional Psychiatrist,” is a professional chef, nutritional biologist, and author of several books on the impact of food on brain health.

The investigators, Huemer and Naidoo, reported no relevant financial disclosures.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hi. I'm Art Caplan. I'm at the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. 

There was an announcement I received February 13, establishing an order from the White House for a new commission. It's called the Make America Healthy Again Commission. I've got the order printed out in my hand.

It's something that everyone watching this video needs to be aware of and attentive to. The commission is meant to advise the federal government, chaired by the new Department of Health and Human Services leader, Robert F.Kennedy, Jr, on all matters regarding health and disease. 

The executive order creating it begins with what I have to say is one of the toughest, meanest indictments of American healthcare, as it now exists, that I've read anywhere. This is not something that was cooked up by some sort of civil rights group or some kind of foundation fighting against corporate American healthcare. This is right out of the world of the president and his top health advisors. 

What they're saying is that American healthcare is a grim failure because of the mess that Americans are in with respect to their health. The highest cancer rates, double the next highest rates of comparable countries. Asthma is twice as common than in most of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and the same for autoimmune diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis.

It basically says the American people are on a trajectory, if we don't do something about the whole healthcare system, that is leading them to premature death and disability due to chronic illness. It also suggests that children, in particular, are at grave risk because of the way healthcare is organized and delivered now.

This is one huge indictment, and what it says is that we want fresh thinking. The charge is what can we do about better nutrition, more physical activity, change to healthy lifestyles,get off medications, try to assess new technology habits — they're talking about cell phones, I presume — and food and drug quality and safety. 

It's hard to be against any of those bits of advice. I think, in many ways, what the commission is charged to do is come up with new ways to think about prevention as opposed to disease treatment. That won't come as a shock to many of you physicians watching.

Many people would like to see our healthcare system pay for more prevention, which it doesn't, and see more resources devoted to counseling and supporting people with respect to maintaining their health. 

I have to say, I don't think there are any big mysteries that have to be examined here.The creation of this commission hints that somehow there are secrets out there that we don't know about. I don't believe that. 

I think we know that lifestyle change is very important. We just don't know how to get it done. I think we know that better diet would be great. We just don't know how to get people to do it.

There's a huge food industry in America that stands in the way of transitioning to healthier diets. Our agriculture is built around unhealthy foods, including sugar and everything. It's going to be very tough to move what I'll call a fast-food society over to healthy lifestyles. 

I don't agree with the rationale given here about the need for new thought completelybecause I think many people know that we are too oriented toward fixing, treating, and rescuing people who have diseases and not doing enough to preserve health. I don't think that's a mystery of poor or limited thinking. 

There are also some concerning aspects in this order to create the committee of what they want this commission to do. For example, they say pay attention to things like cell phone towers; toxic exposures, with the suggestion being perhaps vaccines; and worrying about what's going on with children with respect to too much exposure to nasty elements of the environment. 

Again, I think what's going on with children is pretty well understood: obesity. We've got a big obesity challenge, and I hope that this commission can think about ways to battle obesity. One of the things that the commission's chair, RFK Jr, wants to do is shift lifestyle. I think many of you who practice, regarding children and families, know that efforts to change lifestyle have not ended well.

It's very difficult to do it in the climate and environment in which we live when we're bombarded with ads for unhealthy food and portion sizes that are far bigger than in the rest of the world and on and on. Getting lifestyle change is so tough that we're turning more and more to the injectable weight loss drugs.I don't think that's something that RFK Jr is going to be willing to support.

I don't think we need novel thinking about how to solve it in terms of what the causes are. If we're going to make progress, my comment would be that we have to change reimbursement and what we pay for. We have to intervene earlier with people long before they're sick, with better wellness visits and better well-baby visits.We have to shift how the system delivers prevention. 

I'm not quite on board with new thinking. I'm on board with new modes of thinking about how to deliver prevention to the American people.

 May 27, 2025  

US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisers recommended that manufacturers make no changes to the COVID-19 vaccine that will be available for boosters later this summer.

The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBAC) voted 9-0 that the 2025-26 vaccines should stay the same, containing a single JN.1 strain, which has been dominant globally since 2024.

“There is efficacy,” said Panel Member Eric J. Rubin, MD, PhD, editor-in-chief of The New England Journal of Medicine and adjunct professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston. “It's not fantastic. It's not what it was originally,” he said, adding but that in a population that has broad immunity to the SARS-COV-2 virus, “it wasn't bad.”

The agency usually follows its panels' advice, but nothing is certain for the vaccines this fall. As reported by Medscape Medical News, FDA Commissioner Martin Makary, MD, and FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Director Vinay Prasad, MD, in a “town hall” on May 20 and in a paper in The New England Journal of Medicine said the agency planned to start requiring randomized, controlled trials for approval of COVID vaccines in healthy Americans who are younger than 65 years.

Approvals of boosters over the last 4 years have been based on observational data, and the vaccines have been recommended for all Americans aged 6 months or older.

The FDA has not held any further meetings nor issued a final rule or policy to clarify whether this year's COVID vaccine boosters would be required to conduct new trials.

The agency may have signaled where it is headed with its May 17 full approval for Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, which previously only had emergency use authorization. The FDA limited the vaccine's use to adults older than 65 years and anyone older than 12 years at high risk.

Some panelists were concerned that a randomized trial requirement might cause delays. “Is there a possibility that if we choose a different vaccine [strain], it is actually going to be different regulatory measures that are taken that would delay the vaccine getting to the market?” asked Stanley M. Perlman, MD, PhD, chair of microbiology and immunology at Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa.

Rubin said he believes the observational data presented by COVID vaccine makers “has a lot more richness,” than a randomized trial, given the various exposures to illness and vaccines in a widely varied population. “I don't think the randomized, controlled trial is feasible,” said Rubin.

David C. Kaslow, MD, director of the Office of Vaccines Research and Review at FDA, said that although the agency is still discussing how it will regulate COVID vaccines, “I think there's a shared desired outcome for the timely availability of vaccines to prevent COVID-19.” Kaslow said the proposed new regulatory framework could be a “potential topic for a future VRBPAC meeting.”

Representatives from Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax all said they would have vaccines ready for the fall. “We look forward to working with the agency to ensure timely provision of appropriate data to support COVID-19 vaccine approval for those who need it most,” said Kayvon Modjarrad, MD, PhD, executive director of Viral Vaccines and Immunology Vaccine Research and Development at Pfizer.

At the meeting, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials and vaccine makers said that COVID-19 is still dangerous, especially for those at highest risk, primarily individuals older than 75 years and children younger than 6 months.

The CDC estimates that 30,000-50,000 people have died from COVID since October.

Few Americans choose to get a COVID vaccine, hovering around 25% for adults aged 18 years to 64 years, rising to 50% for those older than 75 years, said Ruth Link-Gelles, PhD, MPH, of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization and critical illness in immunocompetent adults older than 65 years was around 40%-50%, said Link-Gelles. It was the same or slightly lower for immunocompromised adults in the same age group.

Pfizer estimated that COVID vaccines prevented some 107,000 hospitalizations and 6700 in-hospital deaths in 2024.

The vaccine makers argued that their products are safe and effective. “Our vaccines are among the most extensively-monitored products licensed,” said Pfizer's Modjarrad.

The FDA, however, has recently instructed Pfizer and Moderna also to update labeling to expand a warning about myocarditis and pericarditis. Pfizer's label warned of an elevated risk in men 12- to 17-year-olds, Moderna's in men 18- to 24-year-olds. Both will now cite an elevated risk in men aged 16 years to 25 years.

In its letter, the agency cited data from a Lancet study of patients with COVID-19- vaccine–associated myocarditis “showing persistence of abnormal cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings that are a marker for myocardial injury at a median follow-up of approximately 5 months.”

During the hour-long public hearing portion of the meeting, most speakers asked the FDA to immediately recall all COVID vaccines, citing a variety of harms — many of them unproven.

“Rewind now and pull these shots,” said Brian Hooker, PhD, the chief scientific officer of Children's Health Defense — the organization formerly run by current Health and Human Services Department Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Hooker cited myocarditis as a concern. “Based on this alone, the product should have been completely withdrawn,” said Hooker. He also said that COVID vaccines “have been also strongly associated with clotting disorders, including stroke, pulmonary embolism,” and other disorders.

Kaitlin Sundling, MD, PhD, assistant professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the Wisconsin State Lab of Hygiene, said COVID vaccines should be more widely available. “All people, regardless of age and medical history, need broad access to regularly updated COVID vaccine formulations,” said Sundling, who added she was concerned about the FDA's potential requirement for randomized trials and to limit vaccine approvals to those older than 65 years or at high risk.

Noting that the panel had essentially been asked to not talk about that proposed new COVID regulatory framework at the meeting, Sundling said “There is a very real concern that this committee is being used as a pawn to eliminate vaccine access for the US population.”

 May 27, 2025  

TORONTO — The lack of clinical trials testing the efficacy of treatments for axial disease in juvenile spondyloarthritis (axJSpA) remains a large unmet need, according to experts.

Now, the first-ever, pediatric-specific validated classification criteria for axJSpA have been finalized and presented at the Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network (SPARTAN) 2025 Annual Meeting. They promise to identify young people with unequivocal disease for clinical studies.

There's even an online tool that makes implementation of the new criteria fast and easy.

“Our goal was to develop and validate classification criteria for axJSpA that enables identification of a relatively homogenous group for entry into observational clinical trials,” said Pamela F. Weiss, MD, pediatric rheumatologist and clinical research director in the Division of Rheumatology at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia.

Weiss is also first author of a recent report on the classification criteria in Arthritis and Rheumatology.

“We're not intending to capture all possible subjects, but those we think would make the best trial candidates so that we can test some of the novel therapeutics currently approved for use in adults,” she said during her presentation of the criteria.

The highly specific criteria are not meant to guide clinical care, Weiss added.

 

 

“This is the first time that we have these criteria for children with this very important type of arthritis that affects the spine, the sacroiliac joints [SIJs], the hips, the knees, and the large joints of the lower limbs,” said Walter P. Maksymowych, MBChB, professor of medicine at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and a co-author of the report.

“These criteria really do perform very well in identifying patients with this type of arthritis — better than other criteria that have tried to capture this population of children with arthritis,” Maksymowych told Medscape Medical News.

The data-driven criteria are the product of a lengthy, collaborative, consensus-building effort involving international clinical experts, a central imaging team, an independent validation team, and physicians from around the world and their patients.

“I want to recognize that I'm presenting on behalf of an enormous group of people who all made this happen,” Weiss said.

During validation by an independent team of international experts, the dataset demonstrated a specificity of 97.5%, a sensitivity of 64.3%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.81%.

The criteria also demonstrated high specificity in cohort subsets of cases and controls in Asia (100%), Europe (100%), North America (95.9%), and South America (100%).

A comparison of the axJSpA criteria with classification criteria for adult axial SpA (axSpA) showed that the latter all had lower specificity and AUROC. They included the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society axial and peripheral SpA criteria, the International League of Associations for Rheumatology enthesitis-related arthritis criteria, and the European Spondyloarthropathy Study Group criteria for adults.

Weiss emphasized that youths with axSpA are at a high risk for poor outcomes and likely to benefit from early, aggressive therapy. When compared with adult-onset disease, axJSpA is associated with more radiographic changes in the hips and a significantly higher risk for hip replacement. This makes recognition and treatment critical to long-term functional outcomes, Weiss said.

Although many youths with juvenile SpA and axial disease respond to biologics such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, novel therapies are needed for the 10%-15% with an incomplete response or disease progression despite TNF inhibitors.

The most promising agents, including interleukin 17 inhibitors and Janus kinase inhibitors, have demonstrated efficacy in adult axSpA. The final validated axJSpA classification criteria will make it possible to test these agents in patients with juvenile-onset disease, Weiss said.

The criteria consist of seven weighted domains. The most heavily weighted is imaging of active inflammation and of structural lesions. The rest of the domains address pain chronicity, pattern and location, as well as stiffness and genetic features such as HLA-B27 positivity.

The threshold for classification of axJSpA is a score of 50 or higher out of 100. This confirms the presence of axial disease and establishes the patient as a candidate for a phase 3 trial, Weiss said.

When it comes to scoring points using the classification criteria, MRI is the star of the show. Unequivocal evidence of active lesions typical of sacroiliitis on MRI of the SIJs scores 23 out of a possible 23 points. Unequivocal evidence of structural lesions typical of sacroiliitis on MRI of the SIJs also scores 23/23 points.

However, unequivocal evidence of sacroiliitis on radiograph scores a meager 13/23 points.

“MRI is an essential tool in the diagnosis of juvenile axSpA,” Maksymowych said. “You really need the additional precision and detail it provides to assess the sacroiliac joints accurately in children since the growth plates are still open. If you only have x-rays available, you're trying to make a diagnosis with both hands tied behind your back.”

Clinicians more comfortable ordering radiographs will have to learn about MRI interpretation, he predicted. Many radiologists could be in the same boat.

“Few see enough cases to build expertise in evaluating the features of this disease on MRI,” Maksymowych explained. “It's a challenge, but it's also the way forward.”

Unlike adults with axSpA who often present with back pain, youth tend to present with arthritis affecting the large joints of the lower limbs, such as the ankle joint or the tarsal joints of the foot. The patient may have knee pain or a limp but only occasional back stiffness, if at all.

Clinicians should include a history of traumatic injury or injury from a repetitive activity when providing basic patient information such as age and gender, Maksymowych said.

“These criteria really pave the way to making the evaluation of axial disease easier for kids too, and for increasing the likelihood of success with study entry,” he said. “Hopefully, we'll see some progress in the next couple of years.”

Weiss reported receiving financial support from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) and the Spondylitis Association of America. Two coauthors also reported receiving financial support from the NIAMS. No other potential conflicts of interest were reported.

Etrasimod, a once-daily oral selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, is well tolerated and effective in treating eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), demonstrating sustained histologic and endoscopic improvements over 52 weeks.

“Etrasimod offers a promising new therapeutic approach for eosinophilic oesophagitis, addressing the complexities of [type 2 helper T cells]–driven inflammation and the challenges posed by preexisting fibrotic changes,” an expert wrote in an accompanying editorial. “Etrasimod's simple administration, independent of meals, could potentially increase patient compliance.”

The study was led by Evan S. Dellon, MD, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill. It was published online in The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology.

This study was not powered to assess dysphagia symptoms. It included a high proportion of patients with stenosis and prior dilation and few with atopic conditions, relative to other reported EoE studies. The extension phase involved a limited number of patients.

This study was funded by Pfizer. Nine authors declared being current or former employees of Pfizer and holding stock or stock options. Several others reported receiving grants, honoraria, fees, or travel support from, holding stocks of, or having other ties with Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies.

New research showed that the five-step cow's milk ladder and the four-step egg ladder were safe and effective methods of reintroducing milk and egg in high-risk children with immunoglobulin E (IgE)–mediated cow's milk allergy (CMA) and/or hen's egg allergy (HEA).

“We suggest that regular monitoring of these children is essential to avoid prolonging the break period between…the steps of the food ladder and to monitor the regular daily introduction of tolerated forms of milk/egg,” the authors wrote.

Agata Stróżyk, PhD, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on May 22 in Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition.

This study was retrospective in nature, had a small sample size, lacked established regular follow-up periods, and included children with a wide age range.

New poly-metabolite scores worked as objective measures of ultraprocessed food (UPF) intake and could curb reliance on self-report data in studies. 

“Limitations of self-reported diet are well known,” lead investigator Erikka Loftfield, PhD, of the US National Cancer Institute said in an accompanying press release. “Metabolomics provides an exciting opportunity to not only improve our methods for objectively measuring complex exposures like diet and intake of ultraprocessed foods, but also to understand the mechanisms by which diet might be impacting health.”

The study led by Loftfield was published in PLOS Medicine.

Study participants were older US adults whose diets may vary from other populations. Poly-metabolite scores should be evaluated and iteratively improved in populations with diverse diets and a wide range of UPF intake.

The research leading to these results received funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Intramural Research Program at the National Cancer Institute and National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseased, as well as Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo.

Compared with placebo administration, supplementation with beta-hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body, lowered levels of androgens and glucose in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), suggesting its potential as a non-pharmacologic approach for managing the condition.

""The reductions in these markers observed in our study suggest that BHB [beta-hydroxybutyrate] supplementation modulates the androgenic profile in women with PCOS, potentially offering a novel therapeutic approach for addressing hyperandrogenism,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Nikolaj Rittig, MD, PhD, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. It was published online on May 20, 2025 in European Journal of Endocrinology.

This study had limited statistical power for identifying smaller changes in testosterone levels. It focused on short-term effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate supplementation. Additionally, irregular menstrual cycles of participants prevented controlling for menstrual cycle phase during interventions and blood sampling.

Maternal factors, including high maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), high weight gain during pregnancy, and smoking, were associated with an atypically high BMI trajectory in children, based on data from nearly 9500 children.

Childhood obesity remains a major risk factor for chronic health complications throughout life, and identifying modifiable early-life factors may help guide interventions and prevention, wrote Chang Liu, PhD, a psychologist at Washington State University, Pullman, Washington, and colleagues.

“This study allowed us to identify children following unhealthy growth trajectories as early as age 3.5 years and identify the point where BMI starts to show rapid changes such as adiposity rebound, creating crucial opportunities for intervention before obesity becomes established,” Liu said in an interview.

In a study published in JAMA Network Open, the researchers analyzed data from the Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) cohort from January 1997 to June 2024. The final study population included 9483 children (approximately half were boys) from 23 longitudinal pediatric cohorts in the United States and Puerto Rico born between 1997 and 2019.

The primary outcome was childhood BMI. The researchers categorized the children into two BMI trajectories, typical and atypical, using a novel model based on BMI shifts over time. Children with a typical trajectory (8477 children; 89.4%) showed linear BMI decreases to 6 years of age, followed by linear increases from age 6 to 9 years. Children with an atypical trajectory (10 children; 6%) showed early stable BMI from age 1 to 3.5 years, followed by rapid linear increases from 3.5 to 9 years.

The researchers assessed prenatal exposures to smoking, alcohol, and stress (depression or anxiety) as well as maternal characteristics of prepregnancy BMI, gestational weight gain, and child characteristics of preterm birth, birth weight, and breastfeeding.

The analysis used a multiphase latent growth mixture model to identify qualitative shifts in BMI during childhood that have not been addressed in previous studies, the researchers noted.

At 9 years of age, the atypical group had a mean BMI of 26.2, higher than the 99th percentile. Prenatal smoking, high prepregnancy BMI, high gestational weight gain, and high birth weight were significantly associated with the atypical trajectory.

The findings were limited by several factors, including the clinical utility of the researchers' multiphase model, which the researchers described as “more computationally intensive than traditional methods of identifying abnormal childhood growth patterns.” Other limitations included the use of BMI values that may show variations in levels of adiposity based on age and sex, the lack of control for some social determinants of health, and incomplete data on BMI during school age and some perinatal exposures, the researchers wrote.

Despite these limitations, the study identified factors that increase the risk for childhood obesity, and addressing these factors could help redirect unhealthy BMI trajectories, the researchers concluded.

“Without intervention, children exhibiting high BMI trajectories during childhood are more likely to develop overweight or obesity as adolescents and adults and are at higher risk for a range of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases throughout their lifetimes,” Liu told Medscape Medical News. Although examination of developmental pathways that lead to unhealthy vs healthy BMIs is crucial to identify modifiable early life factors, “the challenge has been that most previous research couldn't pinpoint exactly when children's growth patterns start going off track,” Liu said.

Opportunities for clinicians include helping women of reproductive age achieve healthy weight and smoking cessation before pregnancy, supporting appropriate gestational weight gain during pregnancy, and closely monitoring children who show early signs of non-declining BMI patterns, especially those with identified risk factors, Liu said.

Further studies are needed to examine the biological mechanisms linking these early-life factors to different childhood BMI trajectories, Liu told Medscape Medical News. “Additionally, research is needed to understand how social and environmental factors contribute to the racial and ethnic disparities we observed in growth patterns,” she said. “Future work should test whether interventions targeting these modifiable factors during critical developmental periods can successfully help children maintain healthier growth trajectories,” Liu added.

Early identification of risk for pediatric obesity can be crucial to minimizing disease morbidity and mortality, said Charles Hannum, MD, a general pediatrician at Tufts Medical Center, Boston, in an interview.

The current study not only confirms previously known risks but also adds new information to help pediatricians identify young children who would benefit from a more nuanced approach to growth monitoring and who may also benefit from a more robust prevention strategy for obesity, he said.

The data also show how maternal factors and the pregnancy environment influence child health, said Hannum. “Lastly, this study is from a large, diverse population group, making the study conclusions more generalizable to the population of the United States,” he said.

Although some of the study findings were known, such as the association between childhood obesity and prenatal smoking, the current study adds the dimension of how that risk connects to the child's growth trend over time, said Hannum.

“The growth trend is often how pediatricians monitor this risk anecdotally,” he said. The associations between BMI trajectory and modifiable risks are not unexpected, but they help support the assumptions clinicians often make about obesity risk and can inform more focused and individually tailored prevention strategies, he noted.

The data can help support both public health initiatives and clinical practice at the individual level, Hannum told Medscape Medical News. For pediatricians, the findings support starting obesity prevention strategies early and monitoring children who have an at-risk BMI trajectory more frequently, he noted. When children do not follow a trajectory of decreased BMI from early to late toddlerhood, even if a BMI is normal, “we now have evidence that they have an increased risk for developing obesity, and this knowledge may help to prevent some cases of pediatric obesity,” Hannum said.

The current study's limitations include missing and incomplete data and possible challenges when applying the trajectories to broad, diverse populations, given the complex contributors to pediatric obesity, Hannum told Medscape Medical News. More clarity is also needed on when and how to prioritize prevention strategies in the setting of additional obesity risk factors, Hannum added.

The study was supported by the ECHO program of the National Institutes of Health and by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, with additional funding from the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research. The researchers had no financial conflicts to disclose. Hannum had no financial conflicts to disclose.

 May 27, 2025  

LOS ANGELES — Vitamin D is important for brain health, but this might be particularly true for women but doesn't appear to have this beneficial effect in men, early research suggested.

The large study showed an association between greater plasma vitamin D levels in females and better memory and larger subcortical brain structures.

“We found that vitamin D for women was correlated with better cognitive outcomes, but we need to do more research to find out what role vitamin D actually plays at a mechanistic level,” study investigator Meghan Reddy, MD, Psychiatry Resident, UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, Los Angeles, told Medscape Medical News.

The findings were presented here at the American Psychiatric Association (APA) 2025 Annual Meeting.

This latest study added to the growing body of literature of research on vitamin D and brain health. Previous studies have shown that vitamin D may influence cognition and brain function in older adults, potentially through its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. Research also suggested it may promote brain health by increasing neurotrophic factors and aiding in the clearance of amyloid from the brain.

Recent findings published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition suggested that vitamin D may also affect biological aging by preserving telomeres — the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes that shorten with age.

Other research has also shown telomere length may help protect against brain diseases, including a study previously reported by Medscape Medical News, which linked longer leukocyte telomere length to a lower risk for stroke, dementia, and late-life depression.

In the current study, Reddy and colleagues used data from the multisite Human Connectome Project to track individuals over time to understand age-related changes in brain structure, function, and connectivity.

They are investigating various biomarkers that might correlate with aging, including hemoglobin, creatine, glycated hemoglobin (for blood glucose levels), high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein, in addition to vitamin D.

The idea, said Reddy, is to track cognitive health using biomarkers in addition to brain imaging and cognitive testing.

The study included 1132 individuals, 57% of whom were women and 66% of whom were White. The average age was approximately 62 years, with participants ranging from 36 to 102 years old. 

Participants underwent neuropsychological testing to assess short-term memory and fluid intelligence — the capacity to reason and solve problems, which is closely linked to comprehension and learning. They also provided blood samples and underwent MRI scans. Researchers divided participants into two age groups: those younger than 65 years and those 65 years or older.

The investigators found a significant association between vitamin D levels and memory in women (P = .04). 

“What's interesting is that when we looked specifically at memory, higher vitamin D levels were linked to better memory performance — but only in women, not men,” said Reddy, adding that she found this somewhat surprising.

In women, investigators found a significant association between vitamin D levels and the volume of the putamen (P = .05) and pallidum (P = .08), with a near-significant trend for the thalamus.

In contrast, studies show that in men, higher vitamin D levels were associated with smaller volumes of the thalamus, putamen, and pallidum. There were no differences in the impact of vitamin D by age group.

Sex differences in the relationship between vitamin D, cognition, and brain volume warrant further investigation, Reddy said.

She also noted that the study is correlational, examining memory, brain volume, and vitamin D levels at a single timepoint, and therefore it can only offer a hypothesis.

Future studies will include multiple time points to explore these relationships over time. The results did not determine an ideal vitamin D plasma level to promote brain health in women.

Commenting on the research for Medscape Medical News, Badr Ratnakaran, MD, a geriatric psychiatrist in Roanoke, Virginia, and chair of the APA's Council on Geriatric Psychiatry, said the finding that women may get more brain benefits from vitamin D than men is “key” because dementia is more prevalent among women since they tend to live longer.

Other research has shown vitamin D may help manage depression in older women, which makes some sense as dementia and depression “go hand in hand,” he said.

Ratnakaran recommended that women take a vitamin supplement only if they're deficient, as too much vitamin D can lead to kidney stones and other adverse side effects.

The investigators and Ratnakaran reported no relevant disclosures.

Breakthrough MRI scans reveal hidden hypothalamic changes in young women, shedding light on the biological roots of anorexia and obesity, and paving the way for targeted treatments.

 Study: Unraveling neural underpinnings of eating disorders in the female brain: Insights from high-field magnetic resonance imaging. Image Credit: Suppakjj1017 / Shutterstock.com

A recent editorial feature published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition discusses the use of a novel imaging technique to investigate how certain structural features of the hypothalamus affect eating behaviors.

Women are more likely to develop eating disorders like anorexia nervosa than men, particularly during puberty. Despite this disproportional occurrence, few studies have investigated the role of the female brain in neuroscience and psychiatry.

The hypothalamus is a small, heterogeneous brain structure in the diencephalon that regulates homeostatic and hedonic functions involved in feeding behaviors. Current imaging techniques are limited in their ability to capture nuclei subsegmentation within the hypothalamus. As a result, most studies investigating the role of the hypothalamus have been conducted in rodents.

Utilizing precision imaging to investigate the neurobiological roots of eating disorders offers a critical avenue for driving progress.”

In a previous study published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine, researchers identified microstructural alterations in the hypothalamus of young adult females with anorexia nervosa and obesity. To this end, a highly sensitive, ultrahigh-resolution T1 quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is needed to overcome the limitations associated with traditional imaging modalities incapable of visualizing the human hypothalamus.

Herein, the hypothalamus of forty-four young females was imaged, twenty-one of whom were of normal weight, thirteen diagnosed with restrictive anorexia nervosa, and ten developed obesity. Appropriate age-matching removed any potential age-related bias.

Volumes and quantitative T1 values of individual hypothalamic nuclei, which served as proxy markers of cellular integrity, were compared after whole-brain normalization using nonparametric tests. Multivariate nonlinear partial least square (NIPALS) analysis was conducted to identify the factors associated with body mass index (BMI) and eating disorders, such as ghrelin and leptin levels, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters of hypothalamic nuclei, depression, and anxiety.

In this multidisciplinary strategy, 7T MRI data of hypothalamic subregions were bridged with measures of eating behaviors, anxiety, mood, and peripheral hunger—and satiety-related hormone levels.

Volumetric data and quantitative T1 measures of 50 distinct hypothalamic brain regions were obtained. Patients living with anorexia nervosa and, to a lesser extent, obesity had characteristic differences in the hypothalamic para- and periventricular nuclei, as well as connecting fiber tracts, compared to those with normal weight.

Both para- and periventricular nuclei were found to play crucial roles in feeding behaviors, thus indicating that any microstructural alterations in these regions may contribute to the pathophysiology of eating disorders.

Volume reductions are typically associated with atrophy in aging or neurodegenerative diseases. Comparatively, increased brain volumes in younger populations correlate with swelling or inflammation in neuronal tissues. The researchers reported that larger hypothalamic subregions may contribute to eating disorders in females.  

The current study also suggested potential underlying mechanisms for which younger women are at an increased risk of developing eating disorders. Mechanistically, the larger hypothalamic subregions, which may arise due to inflammatory processes, could cause imbalances in food consumption and eating disorders in females.

Considerable variations in leptin and ghrelin levels, along with changes in paraventricular nuclei, right anterior commissure, and left fornix, were observed in females with high body mass index (BMI) values and anorexia, which were associated with eating disorder severity.

The novel neuroimaging technique discussed in this study allowed researchers to identify specific changes in hypothalamic regions in young adult females that contributed to their eating disorders. Notably, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists were found to target the arcuate subnucleus of the hypothalamus and improve unhealthy eating behavior.

In the future, longitudinal studies should be conducted to understand whether modifications in hypothalamic subregional size and quantitative T1 precede the onset of symptoms. A follow-up analysis of structural and functional connectivity in hypothalamus subregions may also elucidate the neural processes within extended limbic and cortical networks in patients with eating disorders.

New research shows both ketogenic and Mediterranean diets help lower blood pressure and support weight loss in adults with elevated cardiovascular risk, highlighting safe, flexible options for managing hypertension.

 Study: Low-Calorie, High-Protein Ketogenic Diet Versus Low-Calorie, Low-Sodium, and High-Potassium Mediterranean Diet in Overweight Patients and Patients with Obesity with High-Normal Blood Pressure or Grade I Hypertension: The Keto–Salt Pilot Study. Image Credit: 9dream studio / Shutterstock.com

A recent study published in the journal Nutrients compares the impact of a low-calorie, high-protein ketogenic diet (KD) with a Mediterranean diet on blood pressure and other cardiovascular measurements in a cohort of overweight/obese individuals.

In 2022, over 2.5 billion people throughout the world were considered overweight, about one million of whom were obese. Obesity increases the risk of numerous health conditions, including metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular disease (CVD), with these effects mediated by high blood pressure, lipid, and glucose levels.

Weight loss is crucial in obese or overweight individuals to improve metabolic function and reduce blood pressure levels. Weight loss is often achieved by restricting caloric intake under a dietitian's supervision to ensure a balanced supply of essential nutrients.

The Mediterranean diet is widely recommended for overweight and obese individuals seeking to reduce their risk of developing CVD. It is characterized by the infrequent intake of red and processed meat, sodium, and alcohol, as well as increased consumption of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes, fish, and unsaturated fatty acids.

Comparatively, the KD is a high-protein, high-fat, and low-carbohydrate diet that has been shown to support weight loss and metabolic health. However, the KD is also associated with high sodium and saturated fat intake, which may not be suitable for individuals at a high risk of CVDs, particularly those with high or borderline blood pressure levels.

The current prospective study included 26 non-diabetic adults, all of whom had central overweight or central obesity and a body mass index (BMI) of 27 kg/m2 or greater. While 15 individuals were assigned to the KD group, 11 followed the Mediterranean diet for the duration of the study period.

All study participants were diagnosed with high-normal BP, which corresponds to BP measurements of 130/85 mmHg or higher, or grade 1 hypertension, which is in the range of 140-160/90-100 mmHg.

Dietary changes were assessed at three months, with these effects based on blood sample analysis, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), and body composition measurements obtained from a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA).

At three months, both the KD and Mediterranean diet intervention groups experienced weight loss. More specifically, the KD led to a mean weight reduction from 98.6 kg at baseline to 87.3 kg, whereas the mean weight in the MD group declined from 93.8 kg to 86 kg.

Mean BP levels also decreased, irrespective of diet. The average systolic BP (SBP) over a 24-hour period declined by nine mmHg from 125 mmHg, whereas the mean diastolic BP (DBP) measurements declined from 79 mmHg to 73.7 mmHg.

Losing five kg of weight is associated with a 4.4 mmHg and 3.6 mmHg reduction in SBP and DBP, respectively. Although this observation exemplifies the vital role of weight loss in reducing CVD risk, pharmacological management is indicated if dietary changes with increased physical activity fail to control the BP.

The proportion of fat-free mass (FFM) to total body mass increased in both groups from 63.7% to 66.5%. In absolute terms, FFM decreased from 61.7 kg to 57.8 kg at three months.

Neither diet was associated with an increased risk of inflammation or renal damage, and both diets were tolerated well. Overall, both the KD and Mediterranean diet led to improvements in all assessed risk factors; however, the proportion of individuals who experienced ‘nocturnal dipping,' a normal physiological response when blood pressure levels are lowest during the night, was greater in those following the Mediterranean diet as compared to the KD group.

In the current study, both the KD and Mediterranean diets led to significant weight loss, improved body composition, and decreased blood pressure levels. Both dietary approaches are considered safe, effective, and well-tolerated.

These two different popular dietary approaches may equally confer metabolic and cardiovascular benefits, emphasizing the importance of weight and FM loss.”

Future studies with larger and more diverse study cohorts, especially over extended durations, are needed to validate these findings and ensure the accuracy of dietary guidelines for the management of hypertension.

A new study to be presented at the SLEEP 2025 annual meeting quantifies the amount of sleep loss experienced by first-time mothers in the weeks after giving birth and is the first to identify the unique type of sleep disruption that persists throughout the first months of motherhood.

Results show that the average daily sleep duration of new mothers was 4.4 hours during the first week after giving birth compared with a pre-pregnancy sleep duration of 7.8 hours. Their longest stretch of uninterrupted sleep also fell from 5.6 hours at pre-pregnancy to 2.2 hours in the first week after delivery. Nearly one-third of participants (31.7%) went more than 24 hours without sleep in the first week with a newborn.

The daily sleep duration of new moms increased to 6.7 hours across postpartum weeks 2 through 7 and 7.3 hours across weeks 8 through 13. However, their longest stretch of uninterrupted sleep remained significantly lower than pre-pregnancy levels at 3.2 hours in weeks 2 through 7 and 4.1 hours in weeks 8 through 13. This novel finding reveals that sleep discontinuity remains a problem for new mothers even as their total nightly sleep duration gradually returns to pre-pregnancy levels.

""The significant loss of uninterrupted sleep in the postpartum period was the most dramatic finding,"" said lead author Teresa Lillis, who has a doctorate in clinical psychology and is an adjunct professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. ""While mothers generally returned to their pre-pregnancy total nightly sleep duration after the first postpartum week, the structure of their sleep remained profoundly altered. These results fundamentally transform our understanding of postpartum sleep; it's not the lack of sleep, but rather, the lack of uninterrupted sleep that is the largest challenge for new mothers.""

The study involved 41 first-time mothers between the ages of 26 and 43 years. They provided their wearable sleep data from their personal Fitbit devices for a full year before childbirth through the end of the first year after giving birth.

Lillis noted that these findings explain why new mothers continue to feel exhausted even when they get the recommended 7 or more hours of sleep per night. The study results also identify sleep discontinuity as a potential risk factor and intervention target for postpartum depression and other postpartum-related health issues.

Our results validate the lived experience of new mothers' exhaustion and provide a new target for sleep-related interventions. Rather than simply encouraging mothers to 'nap when the baby naps', our findings show that mothers would most benefit from strategies that protect opportunities for uninterrupted sleep.""

Teresa Lillis, lead author

This study was supported by trackthatsleep LLC, for which Lillis serves as CEO. The study was conducted at Washington State University's Sleep and Performance Research Center with co-investigators Devon Hansen and Hans Van Dongen.

The research abstract was published recently in an online supplement of the journal Sleep and will be presented Monday, June 9, during SLEEP 2025 in Seattle. SLEEP is the annual meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies, a joint venture of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society.

Researchers are investigating the mechanisms and identifying new areas of the brain that can benefit patients when stimulated.

Persons with Parkinson's disease increasingly lose their mobility over time and are eventually unable to walk. Hope for these patients rests on deep brain stimulation, also known as a brain pacemaker. In a current study, researchers at Ruhr University Bochum and Philipps-Universität Marburg, Germany, investigated whether and how stimulation of a certain region of the brain can have a positive impact on ambulatory ability and provide patients with higher quality of life. To do this, the researchers used a technique in which the nerve cells are activated and deactivated via light. Their report appeared in the journal Scientific Reports on April 12, 2025.

If medication is no longer sufficient in alleviating restricted mobility in the advanced stage of Parkinson's disease, one alternative is deep brain stimulation. An electrical pulse emitter is implanted within the brain, such as in the subthalamic nucleus, which is functionally part of the basal ganglia system.

The group under Dr. Liana Melo-Thomas from Philipps-Universität Marburg was able to show in previous studies on rats that stimulation of the inferior colliculus—chiefly known for processing auditory input—can be used to overcome mobility restrictions. ""There are indications that stimulation of this region of the brain leads to activation of the mesencephalic locomotor region, or MLR,"" says Melo-Thomas.

Interestingly, the colliculus inferior—unlike the basal ganglia—is not affected by Parkinson's disease. However, the research group under Melo-Thomas discovered that its stimulation activates alternative motor pathways and can improve patients' mobility.

The current study aimed to further investigate this activating influence of the inferior colliculus on the MLR. ""We suspected that this would have a positive effect on ambulatory ability,"" says Melo-Thomas.

The Marburg group led by Professor Rainer Schwarting sought support by Dr. Wolfgang Kruse from the Department of General Zoology and Neurobiology at Ruhr University Bochum. The team in Bochum led by Professor Stefan Herlitze played a significant role in co-developing the methods of optogenetics.

While doing so, the researchers ensure that the nerve cells of genetically modified test animals produce a light-sensitive protein in interesting regions of the brain. Light that reaches these nerve cells via small, implanted optical fibers allows the researchers to activate or inhibit them specifically. ""This method is thus much more precise than electrical stimulation, which always affects the area around the cells as well,"" says Kruse.

For the first time, the effect of the stimulation was directly documented with electrophysiological measurements of neuronal activity in the target structures. A multi-electrode system originally developed at Philipps-Universität Marburg was used for this purpose. By combining these methods, the researchers were able to directly understand the effect of the stimulation. Parallel measurement with up to four electrodes is also highly efficient, allowing minimization of the number of animals used. Behavioral effects that can be triggered by the stimulation were monitored in conscious animals.

Optogenetic stimulation in the inferior colliculus predominantly triggered the expected increase in neuronal activity within it. ""Simultaneous measurements in the deeper MLR region showed increased activity in the majority of cells, although nearly one quarter of the cells were inhibited by the additional activity in the inferior colliculus,"" reports Kruse. The activation of individual nerve cells occurred with an average delay of 4.7 milliseconds, indicating a functional synaptic interconnection between the inferior colliculus and MLR.

Investigating circuits outside of the basal ganglia that are affected by Parkinson's disease is a promising step in the search for a new therapeutic approach to alleviating motor deficits resulting from the disease. Such is the case with the connection between the inferior colliculus and the MLR that was investigated for this study.

""Even if the path toward new therapeutic approaches to alleviating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease still appears long, such foundational research is immensely important,"" emphasizes Kruse. The exact mechanisms that lead to the observed relief of symptoms with deep brain stimulation in the basal ganglia are not fully understood. Further investigation of the underlying interconnections may provide new insight that could optimize therapy in the long term.

This study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) with the grants ME4197/2 und ME4197/3 and by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) in Brazil (PROBRAL Grant 88881.198683/2018-01).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Mild breast tenderness and swelling found to be part of healthy menstrual cycles","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250527/Mild-breast-tenderness-and-swelling-found-to-be-part-of-healthy-menstrual-cycles.aspx","Tue, 27 May 2025 16:59:00 GMT","

A one-year study in healthy women who were also consistently cycling every 21-36 days and had normal ovulation, showed that it is usual to experience mild breast tenderness and swelling before the next period. Breast tenderness and swelling are common concerns associated with the menstrual cycle. However, little research previously has indicated how or if these breast symptoms are linked with ovulation.

""Previous research has not clarified if breast tenderness and swelling, that may be experienced before menstruation, are part of a 'premenstrual syndrome' (PMS) and thus a problem and abnormal, or are something that is to be expected,"" said Dr. Azita Goshtasebi, a family physician, and co-author who helped design the study.

""Our study evaluated the experiences of 53 healthy women over the course of a year and found that minimal breast swelling and breast tenderness usually occurred before flow in regular, ovulatory menstrual cycles,"" reported the lead researcher, Dr. Mary Wood. She began this work as a medical student and is currently an internal medicine resident at the University of British Columbia.

Dr. Sonia Shirin, co-author and UBC Centre for Menstrual Cycle and Ovulation research associate, explained: ""Breast symptoms-including whether or not there was any breast tenderness and the breasts changed in size-were recorded daily in the Menstrual Cycle Diary©. Also, ovulation or egg release was confirmed using the validated Quantitative Basal Temperature© analysis in these community women over an average of 13 cycles each.""

This is the first longitudinal study to characterize breast experiences with confirmed ovulation. We were surprised to find that women actually had more breast tenderness and swelling when they had normal ovulation, compared to ovulatory disturbed cycles with short luteal phases (<10 days) or anovulation (no ovulation).""

Dr. Jerilynn C. Prior, principal investigator

""These results are exciting because a better understanding of what are 'normal' or 'healthy' menstrual cycle experiences are critical in order to identify women with recurrent ovulatory disturbances even though their cycles are regular and of normal lengths,"" said Dr. Wood. ""There are possible long-term health consequences associated with disturbed ovulation within normal cycles including bone loss and risk for earlier heart attacks.""

""Note that the relationship of breast tenderness and swelling with normally ovulatory cycles was only possible to show when we examined the experiences of all 53 women in 491 ovulatory cycles versus the 199 with ovulatory disturbances. That disappeared when we studied only the 47 women who had 420 normally ovulatory and 199 ovulatory disturbed cycles,"" Dr. Shirin shared. ""That may be because we had fewer normally ovulatory cycles.""

This study included 53 women, ages 20-41, with menstrual cycle data from an average of 13 cycles each.

Results showed that the median breast tenderness on a 0-4 scale was 1.4, and the change in breast size from usual on a 1-5 scale, where three represents no change, was 4.

A total of 694 cycles had ovulation status documented by temperature analysis, of which 71 per cent were determined to be normally ovulatory; 26 per cent had short luteal phase lengths; and three per cent were anovulatory. Given the small number of anovulatory cycles recorded, unfortunately, the researchers were not able to analyze anovulatory cycle data directly.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Public actions can help reduce discrimination, stigma faced by menopausal women","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250526/Public-actions-can-help-reduce-discrimination-stigma-faced-by-menopausal-women.aspx","Tue, 27 May 2025 01:04:00 GMT","

Hot flushes, memory loss, difficulty concentrating, mood swings, urinary incontinence and joint pain: these are just some of the more than 100 symptoms associated with the menopause, a natural process that all women go through when they stop ovulating and menstruating, typically between the ages of 45 and 55.

In addition to the stigma and discrimination women face during this biological transition, the physical and psychological effects can negatively impact their quality of life and productivity at work.

A new open access study published in Frontiers in Reproductive Health by Clara Selva Olid, researcher at the Behavioural Design Lab (BDLab), which is affiliated to the UOC's research unit on Digital Health, Health and Well-being, has found that implementing public actions in the political, social and organizational spheres can help reduce discrimination and social stigma, counteract the lack of attention given to this stage of life and significantly improve both quality of life and the healthcare received by women.

Drawing on interviews with 20 women between the ages of 45 and 60 who have experienced both physical and psychological symptoms related to the menopause and postmenopause over the past five years, Selva Olid, also a member of the Faculty of Psychology and Education Sciences at the UOC, has developed a 10-point proposal with three key areas for action: social awareness, education, and workplace and health measures.

""My aim was to give women a voice in the design of more inclusive and effective policies to better support them through this transition,"" explained Selva Olid, who believes that it is essential for women to be actively involved in the design, implementation and evaluation of public policies to ensure that they truly reflect their needs and lived experiences.

The study also brings to the fore the debate on how to adapt such initiatives to the different social and economic realities faced by women in Spain.

According to the Catalan Institute of Statistics (IDESCAT), there are nearly one million women in the region between the ages of 45 and 60 - the age range in which this transition typically begins. Factors such as health, genetics, sociocultural context and exposure to environmental factors ultimately determine when menstruation ends for good. However, perimenopause can begin several years earlier, bringing irregular periods and hormonal fluctuations. Once menstruation stops, postmenopausal symptoms, which affect eight out of 10 women, can last for several years.

Despite being a natural process that all women go through, there is often a lack of information. The public health system also tends to be over-medicalized, and myths and discriminations persist.

Against this background, Selva Olid's study aimed to identify and analyse actions that public organizations in Spain can take to support women during the menopausal transition. The study concludes with a 10-point action plan in three key areas: the social sphere, public health and the workplace, and medical research.

1. Social sphere. The women who took part in the study called for measures to increase the social visibility of the menopause, raise awareness of its effects and develop strategies for support and normalization. One such measure would be to include the menopause in school curricula, which would help normalize it as just another stage of life.

""It's about developing support strategies to prevent many women from feeling isolated or ashamed, and ultimately to break the stigma,"" said Selva Olid, adding that ""we need to work to empower women to take more control over their own health"". Role models have an incredibly positive impact, and in this respect Selva Olid believes that social media play a helpful role in normalizing this stage of life - unlike traditional media, which have lagged behind in supporting this mindset shift.

2. Public health. It is vital to have health professionals trained in menopause, as well as access to psychological help, support groups or workshops on healthy habits. Selva Olid said that ""although it's a natural stage of life that can have a significant impact on a woman's health and work performance, the financial cost of treatments to relieve symptoms and improve well-being is borne solely by women. But it should be a social responsibility - women don't choose to go through the menopause.""

3. The workplace. The interviews conducted as part of the study show that, in order to create a more equitable working environment, there is a need for mandatory work-life balance policies and clearly defined menopause support. This includes government incentives for organizations that implement best practices and promote staff training and awareness to reduce gender bias, encourage open dialogue and help normalize this life stage.

Measures such as appointing menopause role models in companies, offering flexible working arrangements and adaptations (e.g. more breathable uniforms), installing additional water stations in the workplace, allowing remote working and providing menopause-related leave can be highly effective in helping women to balance work with the challenges of this stage, while also reducing absenteeism and preventing job loss or resignation.

In this regard, Catalonia is a pioneer in Spain, having adopted the Comprehensive Plan for Menstrual and Climacteric Equity 2023-2025, which represents a significant step forward in recognizing menstrual and menopausal health as a matter of rights and well-being, both in the workplace and in society. However, as Selva Olid pointed out, ""it's still not enough to achieve real equity, as it's not a binding law that forces action to be taken in the workplace"".

4. Medical research. More funding and resources need to be devoted to research into the menopause, particularly treatments and therapies to relieve symptoms and prevent long-term health problems.

To date, research into women's health, if it has taken place at all, has focused on the reproductive phase, leaving menopause in the background, despite its profound physical, emotional and social impact.""

 Clara Selva Olid, researcher, UOC

She added that her interest in this area stems from ""the need to increase scientific knowledge about this stage of life and to provide data that can help improve women's quality of life"".

The American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) published the new Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG): Surgical Management of Chronic Rhinosinusitis today in Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affects 11.6% of adults and prompts 4.1 million annual ambulatory visits.

Chronic rhinosinusitis doesn't just affect the nose-it can influence a person's general life. Patients can struggle with poor sleep, brain fog, depression, anxiety, and reduced productivity that ripples through their relationships and work or school performance.""

Jennifer J. Shin, MD, SM, Chair of the CPG Guideline Development Group

""Many people don't realize that chronic rhinosinusitis can affect patients as much as diseases that have traditionally been viewed as life-threatening or more serious. Patients with CRS face daily challenges that deserve our full attention and comprehensive care. This CPG provides the guidance for developing the needed care pathways for patients who may undergo surgery for CRS, based on current best evidence, such as systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized control trials, as well as observational studies when these were more apt for specific clinical research questions.""

CRS is diagnosed when a patient has two or more symptoms or signs of CRS for 12 weeks or longer, and inflammation is documented by one or more findings. The symptoms and signs include:

Some people with chronic sinus problems need surgery when medications alone don't provide enough relief. For certain types of sinus disease, having surgery sooner can help prevent worsening symptoms and reduce pain. Surgery works especially well for people who have fungal infections or nasal polyps (small growths), since these conditions often don't respond well to medication alone. Surgery may also help people whose sinus problems cause frequent infections, ongoing symptoms, or make other conditions like asthma worse.

This CPG provides proven, research-based recommendations for the best ways to treat chronic sinus problems. Specifically, through 11 evidence-based key action statements, it covers the main surgery and additional treatments that might be needed, as well as follow-up procedures when necessary. The goal is to ensure patients receive excellent care before, during, and after their sinus surgery, while making sure doctors clearly explain treatment options and involve patients in making informed decisions about their care.

The guideline development group consisted of 18 panel members representing experts in specialties/subspecialities encompassing rhinology, comprehensive otolaryngology, otolaryngic allergy, otorhinolaryngological advanced practice provision, as well as a consumer representative.

Public healthcare emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can drastically disrupt healthcare systems with long-term repercussions. The effects of such healthcare crises are more pronounced in the aging population, who are particularly vulnerable to chronic infections and sudden disruptions in healthcare.

The COVID-19 outbreak that emerged in December 2019 quickly spread worldwide, and several emergency measures were urgently implemented to curb its transmission. During the initial phase of the pandemic, stringent measures like social distancing, isolation, and mandatory wearing of masks were implemented. Unfortunately, older individuals were at a higher risk of acquiring the infection and were more likely to experience negative outcomes. The fear of infection, coupled with the state of emergency (SoE) declarations, has led to older adults refraining from seeking necessary medical care.

While initial responses to the pandemic have been well-documented, its long-term impact on healthcare utilization and access among the elderly remains unclear. Furthermore, the prolonged pandemic was characterized by the spread of relatively less virulent strains, gradual relaxation of stringent measures, and widespread vaccination, with limited data on the effect of this transition.

To bridge this knowledge gap, researchers from Waseda University, Japan, sought to analyze the effects of the extended phase-from November 2021 to September 2022-on older adults in Japan, one of the world's most aged societies with a universal healthcare system. The team comprised of Associate Professor Rong Fu from the Faculty of Commerce, master's student Sizhe Liu from the Graduate School of Commerce, Assistant Professor Masato Oikawa from the Faculty of Education and Integrated Arts and Sciences, Professor Haruko Noguchi from the Faculty of Political Science and Economics, and Professor Akira Kawamura from the Faculty of Human Sciences.

Explaining the rationale behind their research, Fu, the lead author, says, ""As populations age globally, maintaining healthcare access during public health emergencies becomes increasingly critical. Our research addresses this challenge by providing insights into how healthcare systems can balance infection control with continued access to essential services for vulnerable elderly populations."" Their findings were published online in Scientific Reports by Nature Research on April 22, 2025.

The researchers used a comprehensive dataset of 189,841,257 medical claims linked with income tax records from the long-term care insurance system to analyze trends in healthcare utilization among Japan's oldest-old population aged 75 years and above. They correlated trends in healthcare access and utilization with the implementation of public health measures, crisis severity, and socioeconomic status.

The analysis revealed that the implementation of precautionary measures led to a modest drop in the use of medical services and outpatient visits. Nevertheless, healthcare costs and services remained stable despite a decrease in patient volumes. The use of medical services varied across different residential areas depending on crisis severity and the extent of precautionary measures. Notably, there was no difference in healthcare utilization across different income levels except for dental services. Dental care visits by older adults with a lower income were significantly lower than high-income groups, highlighting socioeconomic disparities in dental care during public emergencies.

Overall, these findings suggest that healthcare adaptations can address the needs of the elderly during medical emergencies and help avoid medical delays with dire consequences. Adaptations may include integrated monitoring systems, enhanced safety protocols to bridge gaps in preventive dental care, early warning systems, and flexible delivery options, such as remote or mobile care, to improve accessibility for vulnerable groups.

""Our findings can help inform policymakers who devise targeted interventions to prevent socioeconomic disparities in healthcare access from widening during crises. Additionally, for healthcare providers, our research demonstrates the importance of maintaining service intensity even when visit frequency fluctuates,"" Fu adds.

Newly confirmed COVID-19 cases and governmental emergency responses. Notes: COVID-19 case data were obtained from the official governmental website. Data collection ended on May 7, 2023, due to the reclassification of COVID-19 to a Category V Infectious Disease. Information regarding the enforcement of SoE and SoPE policies was gathered from the official website of the Cabinet Agency for Infectious Diseases Crisis Management. The gray shaded area in both graphs denotes the study period.

Taking a statin medication is an effective, safe, and low-cost way to lower cholesterol and reduce risk of cardiovascular events. Despite clinicians recommending that many patients with diabetes take statins, nearly one-fifth of them opt to delay treatment. In a new study, researchers from Mass General Brigham found that patients who started statin therapy right away reduced the rate of heart attack and stroke by one third compared to those who chose to delay taking the medication. The results, which can help guide decision-making conversations between clinicians and their patients, are published in the Journal of the American Heart Association

I see patients with diabetes on a regular basis, and I recommend statin therapy to everyone who is eligible. Some people refuse because they want to first try lifestyle interventions or other drugs. But other interventions are not as effective at lowering cholesterol as starting statin therapy as soon as possible. Time is of the essence for your heart and brain health.""

Alexander Turchin, MD, MS, senior author of the Division of Endocrinology, Brigham and Women's Hospital

Heart attacks and strokes remain the leading cause of complications and mortality for patients with diabetes. Statin therapy reduces risk of these cardiovascular events by preventing plaque buildup in the blood vessels, which, once accumulated, prevents delivery of oxygen and essential nutrients to the heart and brain.

The researchers used an artificial intelligence method called Natural Language Processing to gather data from the electronic health records of 7,239 patients at Mass General Brigham who ultimately started statin therapy during the nearly 20-year study period. The median patient age was 55, with 51% being women, 57% white, and the median HbA1c-a measure of blood sugar-being 6.9.

Nearly one-fifth (17.7%) of the patients in the study declined statin therapy when it was first recommended by their clinicians, then later accepted the therapy (after a median of 1.5 years) upon repeated recommendation by their clinician. Of those who delayed, 8.5% had a heart attack or stroke. But for patients who started statins immediately, the rate of those cardiovascular events was just 6.4%.

""Clinicians should recognize the increased cardiovascular risk associated with delaying statin therapy for patients with diabetes and use this information to guide shared decision-making conversations with their patients,"" said Turchin.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New biomarker Identified for predicting microvascular health of the kidneys","http://www.news-medical.net/news/20250527/New-biomarker-Identified-for-predicting-microvascular-health-of-the-kidneys.aspx","Tue, 27 May 2025 12:13:00 GMT","

In a world first, Canadian scientists at the CRCHUM, the hospital research centre affiliated with Université de Montréal, have identified microRNA able to protect small blood vessels and support kidney function after severe injury.

For the four million people diagnosed with chronic renal failure in Canada-and millions more abroad-this scientific advancement could have a major impact on early diagnosis and prevention of the disease.

Previously, there was no known reliable biomarker for evaluating the health of these capillaries and for developing targeted approaches to preserve kidney function.

In a study published last Thursday in JCI Insight, the CRCHUM research team shows that miR-423-5p microRNA is a promising marker in the blood for predicting the microvascular health of the kidneys.

UdeM medical professors Marie-Josée Hébert and Héloïse Cardinal, holders of the Shire Chair in Nephrology, Renal Transplantation and Regeneration, co-authored the study with Hébert's research associate Francis Migneault.

Their specialty is studying the loss of peritubular capillaries, a conclusive indicator of chronic renal failure.

Located in the kidneys, millions of these small blood vessels filter waste products out of the blood and transport the oxygen and nutrients necessary for the organ's functions.

Kidney injuries, caused by the temporary interruption and restoration of blood flow, can lead to a decrease in the number of small blood vessels, seriously disrupting kidney function.

In people who have received a transplant, if kidney function is severely altered, the kidney's survival is threatened.""

Marie-Josée Hébert, nephrology-transplant physician and UdeM's outgoing vice-rector for research, discovery, creation and innovation

""Using this biomarker, a test could be developed to evaluate the status of the small blood vessels much earlier,"" she said. ""Doctors in hospitals could then better evaluate the microvascular health of higher-risk patients.

""These could include elderly patients or those undergoing surgeries during which blood flow is temporarily stopped, as is the case for organ transplants or cardiovascular interventions.""

""We first observed fluctuating levels of miR-423-5p microRNA in the blood of mice with acute kidney injuries,"" said Migneault, the study's first author. ""These results were then confirmed in 51 transplant recipients who participated in the CHUM kidney transplant biobank.""

Thanks to this biomarker, clinical teams could confirm whether their interventions improve or diminish the health of small blood vessels.

""But what's really incredible is that by injecting this microRNA into mice with kidney injuries, we were able to preserve the small blood vessels and limit the damage done to the kidneys,"" said Migneault.

While direct injection into the kidney is a clinically feasible method during a transplant, to protect the remaining small blood vessels, the CRCHUM scientists are now focused on alternative techniques to transport the microRNA, or likely a microRNA cocktail, to the kidney.

In terms of prevention, a test based on this miR-423-5p microRNA could be useful for patients with cardiac failure, pulmonary failure or certain neurodegenerative diseases.

""For these medical conditions, the loss of small blood vessels plays a key role, because of the association with normal or accelerated aging,"" said Hébert. ""Our discovery could, therefore, have a significant impact on the health of all Canadians.""

For those with pulmonary failure, several research projects are in progress under Emmanuelle Brochiero, a researcher and head of the Immunopathology research theme at the CRCHUM.

It may also be possible, using the CHUM's biological material biobank, to determine if existing medications, administered after a kidney transplant to treat another issue, impact small blood vessel health, added Hébert.

Scientists have unearthed surprising details about how our bodies handle insulin – the hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar and developing diabetes.

The discovery could lead to better treatment of type 2 diabetes and earlier diagnosis, potentially even before the disease develops.

In a new paper in the scientific journal Cell, researchers from the University of Copenhagen found that all individuals have unique and varying degrees of insulin resistance at the molecular level.

The discovery of this 'molecular fingerprint' for insulin sensitivity challenges the traditional binary classification of people as being either healthy or living with type 2 diabetes.

We found huge variation in insulin sensitivity, even among people considered healthy and among those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. There are even some individuals living with type 2 diabetes who respond better to insulin than healthy individuals. Our study highlights the need to move beyond separating people into two boxes and recognize individual variation.""

Atul Deshmukh, Associate Professor from the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, CBMR, University of Copenhagen

He is one of the senior authors of the research that was carried out in collaboration with Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and Steno Diabetes Center in Denmark.

The breakthrough was made using cutting-edge protein analysis, known as proteomics, to study how insulin affects muscle tissue. This approach enabled the team to map molecular changes in muscle biopsies from over 120 individuals.

Their analyses revealed that certain proteins change consistently as insulin resistance develops. These molecular signatures could help identify people at risk earlier than current clinical methods allow – even before symptoms appear.

""By learning more about the molecular signatures of insulin resistance, we're building the foundation for precision medicine in type 2 diabetes tailored to each patient. Our research is a big step in that direction,"" adds Anna Krook, Professor at Karolinska Institutet and co-lead author of the study.

In addition, the researchers were able to use these molecular fingerprints to precisely predict how well the body handles insulin.

""When we combine this deep, clinical data with the molecular signatures of insulin resistance, we suddenly understand a lot more about people's insulin resistance that we can use to design precision medicine,"" says Jeppe Kjærgaard Northcote, first author of the study and researcher at CBMR.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Abdominal fat emerges as independent risk factor for psoriasis in women","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250527/Abdominal-fat-emerges-as-independent-risk-factor-for-psoriasis-in-women.aspx","Tue, 27 May 2025 10:57:00 GMT","

Researchers have found that central body fat, especially around the abdomen, is more strongly linked to psoriasis risk than total body fat, particularly in women. This link between central fat and psoriasis remained consistent regardless of genetic predisposition, indicating that abdominal fat is an independent risk factor. The study in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, published by Elsevier, provides insights that could help improve early risk prediction and guide personalized prevention strategies.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can have a significant impact on quality of life. Many individuals with psoriasis also have elevated levels of body fat. While it is well established that increasing levels of body fat raise the risk of developing psoriasis, the impact of specific fat distribution and genetics remains unclear.

Researchers of the current study analyzed data from over 330,000 participants with White British ancestry in the UK Biobank, including more than 9,000 people with psoriasis. They examined 25 different measures of body fat using both traditional methods and advanced imaging techniques, assessing how each was associated with psoriasis.

Lead investigator Ravi Ramessur, MD, St John's Institute of Dermatology, King's College London, explains, ""Our research shows that where fat is stored in the body matters when it comes to psoriasis risk. Central fat - especially around the waist - seems to play a key role. This has important implications for how we identify individuals who may be more likely to develop psoriasis or experience more severe disease, and how we approach prevention and treatment strategies.""

Catherine H. Smith, MD, also at St John's Institute of Dermatology, King's College London, and senior author adds, ""As rates of obesity continue to rise globally, understanding how different patterns of body fat influence chronic inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis is important. Our findings suggest that central body fat contributes to psoriasis risk irrespective of genetic predisposition and reinforces the importance of measuring waist circumference and pro-active healthy weight strategies in psoriasis care.""

Because this study only included individuals of White British ancestry from the UK Biobank, the generalizability of these findings to more diverse populations may be limited. Future studies incorporating datasets with dermatologist-confirmed diagnoses and broader ethnic representation will be important to further validate these associations and refine risk stratification approaches.

Dr. Ramessur notes, ""We were surprised by how consistently strong the association was across different central fat measures and how much stronger the effect was in women. The observed links between central body fat and psoriasis suggest that there may be underlying biological mechanisms contributing to the disease that are not yet fully understood and which warrant further investigation.""

In an accompanying editorial Joel M. Gelfand, MD, MSCE, FAAD, Department of Dermatology and Center for Clinical Sciences in Dermatology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, points to the potential of incretin therapy for psoriatic disease. Incretins are gut-derived hormones, principally glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), that regulate glucose, digestion, and appetite, and are approved for treatment of diabetes, obesity, and obesity-associated obstructive sleep apnea.

Dr. Gelfand comments, ""The strong relationship between psoriasis and obesity and the emerging promise of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA) for reducing psoriasis morbidity is a call to action for large scale clinical trials of GLP1RA monotherapy for treatment of psoriasis. Our current paradigm of just focusing on the skin and joint manifestations when treating psoriasis is outdated in the context of our evolving understanding of the tight relationship of psoriasis, obesity, and cardiometabolic disease.""

I am a bioprocess engineer by training, and I have spent 13 years building devices and processes for cell and gene therapy across academia, industry and startups.

I will be talking about ImmuneBridge and how we have used our proprietary technology to develop a rapid, affordable, and impactful preclinical development process to evaluate drug candidates. This process directly reflects the clinical manufacturing process and can even use the same starting material. ImmuneBridge and our partners can save time, money, and patient lives using this approach. Our advantage is due to our proprietary HSC expansion molecule, IBR403, which enables us to generate large numbers of HSCs that are further expanded and differentiated into many kinds of immune cells. For this talk, I will be focusing on our HSC expansion and NK differentiation processes.

The first step is expanding the cord blood HSCS to generate a screening-scale HSC bank or a manufacturing-scale HSC bank. The frozen HSC vials can then be differentiated into NK cells in multiple runs, both for screening and for manufacturing. The HSC to NK differentiation is a two-part process where we first generate lymphoid progenitors and then mature the cells into NK cells. All these steps are done in well-mixed bioreactors, so the 10 ml bioreactor screening scale translates easily into the litre scale required to reach thousands of doses for commercial-scale manufacturing. In the screening process, after NK cells are differentiated, they are tested and filtered in multiple levels of in vitro and in vivo assays that yield the top 1-10% of indication-specific drug candidates. The CBUs of these candidates are then used for the clinical and commercial manufacturing scales, such that the same donor is used from preclinical to commercial stage.

Part of the importance of scale up relates to COGS reduction – larger batch sizes minimize the cost impact of labor, facility usage and the QC sample “tax.” Most of the challenges come from going to clinical trials with a process that is difficult to scale and will need a lot of changes after Phase I. The first challenge is to choose a cell source that can be scaled, i.e. it has the potential to expand and deliver the final quality, such as IBR403 expanded cord blood HSCS.

Another scale-up challenge is that even for scalable processes, there is a need to confirm that the equipment that is used in smaller scales (fit for Phase I trials) has a scaled version for commercial manufacturing. For instance, stirred tank scale-up has a low risk of not having a larger version for commercial scale. On the other side of the spectrum, static culture equipment does not scale volumetrically and requires additional surface area and scale out, which will hurt the manufacturing costs in the end.

Manufacturers will finalize their production methods before commercialization through validation. What is important is not to finalize the process too early and leave room for changes that might be required as the product's clinical data becomes available. It might be necessary to change the process to adjust the product quality to the new clinical data. The challenge with changes during the clinical stage of development is that they are hard to make, from the regulatory point of view. Now imagine doing these clinically relevant process changes while you are also figuring out how to make enough of your product – it is a very hard challenge. This is why any developer should have scalability and donor selection solved from the preclinical stage.

Allogeneic cell therapies have been affected by a pressure to reduce the price tag of cell therapies, while delivering the same quality as autologous cell therapies. But is it reasonable to expect the same persistence from an allogeneic CAR T therapy as from an autologous CAR-T therapy? Certainly not in all indications. I would expect allogeneic cell therapies to deliver the same effect as their autologous counterparts across multiple doses, which need a lower price point.

The scalability of allogeneic cell therapies holds the key to offering these affordable products to the masses, where we know that autologous cell therapy is unlikely to deliver. Scalability means equipment size, production capacity, and donor selection. In the allogeneic space, developers can select donors by avoiding “bad donors”, or they can select the best donors empirically. This is why ImmuneBridge addresses donor selection in scale-down bioreactors, together with other process parameters and cell engineering strategies. As more donor data is collected, an ML/AI supervised analysis of the data will make donor selection easier.

Cell engineering strategies have been advancing at a good pace. Besides the TRAC locus KO, there are several strategies that allogeneic companies have been developing, such as b2m KOs or HLA-E expression to cloak the cell product from the host immune system. On this note, I would like to see a better integration of allogeneic therapies with the host immune system. For instance, an NK cell product would kill enough tumor cells to trigger the host's immune system via cytokine secretion and antigen presentation. In this way, we would move from a pharmacokinetic driven persistence (where cell products last longer in the body) to a pharmacodynamic driven persistence, where what lasts is the effect.

A more futuristic example of what the future might hold is the use of allogeneic NK cells to prevent cancer - by clearing transformed cells that the patient's own immune system would otherwise let proliferate. One challenge with an approach like this is the definition of medical need, which might arise as molecular diagnostics and imaging technologies continues evolving to detect earlier stages of cancer. This is the type of scenario that requires improvements to cost and manufacturing scale but also other technological and regulatory innovations.

Any good clinical news from any company would be perfect. I expect to hear a lot about manufacturing-aware preclinical development, new cell types such as gamma delta T-cells and innovative cell engineering that address cancer cell targeting and the host immune system interactions. I am particularly interested to hear new developments in NK cell manufacturing, given that this is our most advanced product.

We have two defined goals that contribute to our mission of making affordable and accessible cell therapy cures: partner with other immune cell therapy developers and develop our internal pipeline. To enable these goals, we are exploring our competitive advantage of using our proprietary molecule, IBR403, for HSC expansion in a new perfusion process, and we are continuing our work to make higher yields of the most mature NK cells possible.

On the partnership angle, we are talking to potential partners that would either add a new cell engineering strategy to our cells and processes or anyone who wants to develop a more scalable version of their allogeneic HSC, T, gamma delta or NKT cell therapy, among others. We are really looking to offer scalable cell therapy manufacturing to the entire industry.

I have been at ImmuneBridge for nearly 3 years, most of these as VP of CMC, and I am currently Chief Technology Officer - overseeing our technical strategy and roadmap, as well as managing the technical team and program execution.

Before ImmuneBridge, I worked for 5 years on the design, testing, and validation of equipment, consumables, and reagents for cell therapy manufacturing at MilliporeSigma and FloDesign Sonics. Outside of the US, I worked as a scientist at CCRM (Toronto, CA) and did 5 years of postdoc work at University College London in the UK.

My doctoral program was in Bioengineering, and most of the work was done at IBET, Portugal, in collaboration with the chemical engineering department of MIT.

The focus of my career has been on making cell and gene therapy manufacturing simpler and more affordable, whether that is by inventing new equipment, assembling new processes or developing new cell therapy products, at ImmuneBridge. My main acquired taste is people development and mentoring – the only path to doing great work is with teamwork.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Researchers identify key nerve cells behind semaglutide's appetite reduction","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250527/Researchers-identify-key-nerve-cells-behind-semaglutides-appetite-reduction.aspx","Tue, 27 May 2025 16:36:00 GMT","

A specific group of nerve cells in the brain stem appears to control how semaglutide affects appetite and weight – without causing nausea. The discovery, made at the University of Gothenburg, could pave the way for better drugs to treat obesity.

Semaglutide belongs to a group of drugs called GLP-1R agonists and has been shown to effectively reduce food intake and body weight. The drug is already well established as part of the treatment for obesity and type 2 diabetes, but can cause side effects such as nausea and muscle loss.

In a new study, researchers at the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg have shown that it is possible to distinguish the nerve cells in the brain that control the beneficial effects – such as reduced food intake and fat loss – from those that contribute to side effects. The study is published in the journal Cell Metabolism.

To investigate how semaglutide affects the brain, the researchers worked with mice. They tracked which nerve cells were activated by the drug and were then able to stimulate these cells – without administering the drug itself.

The result was that the mice ate less and lost weight, just as they did when treated with semaglutide. When these nerve cells were killed, the drug's effect on appetite and fat loss instead decreased significantly. However, side effects such as nausea and muscle loss remained.

This suggests that these nerve cells control the beneficial effects of semaglutide. We have therefore identified a specific group of nerve cells that is necessary for the effects that semaglutide has on weight and appetite, but which does not appear to contribute to any significant extent to side effects such as nausea. If we can target the treatment there, we may be able to maintain the positive effects while reducing side effects.""

Júlia Teixidor-Deulofeu, first author of the study and PhD student at Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg

The identified nerve cells are located in an area of the brain called the dorsal vagal complex. For the researchers, the result is not only an early step toward potentially improved treatment, it also provides new knowledge about how semaglutide works in the brain. The study also provides deeper insight into how the brain stem regulates our energy balance.

""Semaglutide and other GLP-1R agonists are currently being prescribed to more and more people and are also being investigated for other potential indications such as substance use disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. It is important to understand how these drugs actually work. The better we understand this, the greater the opportunity we have to improve them,"" says Linda Engström Ruud, researcher and supervisor to PhD students Júlia Teixidor-Deulofeu and Sebastian Blid Sköldheden, who both worked on the project.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Global warming contributes to higher cancer mortality in women","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250527/Global-warming-contributes-to-higher-cancer-mortality-in-women.aspx","Tue, 27 May 2025 06:47:00 GMT","

Scientists have found that global warming in the Middle East and North Africa is making breast, ovarian, uterine, and cervical cancer more common and more deadly. The rise in rates is small but statistically significant, suggesting a notable increase in cancer risk and fatalities over time.

""As temperatures rise, cancer mortality among women also rises - particularly for ovarian and breast cancers,"" said Dr. Wafa Abuelkheir Mataria of the American University in Cairo, first author of the article in Frontiers in Public Health. ""Although the increases per degree of temperature rise are modest, their cumulative public health impact is substantial."" 

Climate change isn't healthy. Rising temperatures, compromised food and water security, and poor air quality all increase the burden of disease and death worldwide. Natural disasters and the strain of unanticipated weather conditions also disrupt infrastructure, including healthcare systems. When it comes to cancer, that can mean people are more exposed to risk factors like environmental toxins and are less likely to receive a prompt diagnosis and treatment. This combination of factors could lead to a major rise in the incidence of serious cancers, but quantifying it is difficult. 

To investigate the effects of climate change on women's cancer risk, the researchers selected a sample of 17 Middle Eastern and North African countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudia Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Palestine. These countries are seriously vulnerable to climate change and are already seeing striking temperature rises. The researchers collected data on the prevalence and mortality of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, and uterine cancer, and compared this information with changing temperatures between 1998 and 2019.

Women are physiologically more vulnerable to climate-related health risks, particularly during pregnancy. This is compounded by inequalities that limit access to healthcare. Marginalized women face a multiplied risk because they are more exposed to environmental hazards and less able to access early screening and treatment services."" 

Dr. Sungsoo Chun, co-author, American University, Cairo

The prevalence of the different cancers rose by 173 to 280 cases per 100,000 people for every additional degree Celsius: ovarian cancer cases rose the most and breast cancer cases the least. Mortality rose by 171 to 332 deaths per 100,000 people for each degree of temperature rise, with the greatest rise in ovarian cancer and the smallest in cervical cancer.

When the researchers broke this down by country, they found that cancer prevalence and deaths rose in only six countries - Qatar, Bahrain, Jordan, Saudia Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Syria. This could be due to particularly extreme summer temperatures in these countries, or other factors which the model couldn't capture. The rise was not uniform between countries: for instance, the prevalence of breast cancer rose by 560 cases per 100,000 people for each degree Celsius in Qatar, but only 330 in Bahrain.

Although this shows that increased ambient temperature is a probable risk factor for these cancers, it also suggests that temperature has a different effect in different countries - so there are likely to be other factors modifying risk. For instance, increased heat could be associated with higher levels of carcinogenic air pollution in some places.

""Temperature rise likely acts through multiple pathways,"" said Chun. ""It increases exposure to known carcinogens, disrupts healthcare delivery, and may even influence biological processes at the cellular level. Together, these mechanisms could elevate cancer risk over time."" 

Higher prevalence could also reflect improvements in cancer screening. However, better screening would be expected to result in fewer deaths, as early-stage cancer is easier to treat. But both death rates and prevalence rose, suggesting that the driving factor is exposure to risk factors.

""This study cannot establish direct causality,"" cautioned Mataria. ""While we controlled for GDP per capita, other unmeasured factors could contribute. Nonetheless, the consistent associations observed across multiple countries and cancer types provide compelling grounds for further investigation."" 

This research also underlines the importance of considering climate-related risks in public health planning.

""Strengthening cancer screening programs, building climate-resilient health systems, and reducing exposure to environmental carcinogens are key steps,"" said Chun. ""Without addressing these underlying vulnerabilities, the cancer burden linked to climate change will continue to grow.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Early teen obesity in boys may affect the health of future generations","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250527/Early-teen-obesity-in-boys-may-affect-the-health-of-future-generations.aspx","Tue, 27 May 2025 11:33:00 GMT","

A new study suggests that boys who become overweight in their early teens risk damaging the genes of their future children, increasing their chances of developing asthma, obesity and low lung function.

Research published this week in Nature Communications Biology is the first human study to reveal the biological mechanism behind the impact of fathers' early teenage obesity on their children.

Researchers from the University of Southampton and the University of Bergen investigated the epigenetic profiles of 339 people, aged 7 to 51. They assessed the father's changes in body composition across adolescence using self-reported body image as a proxy for body fat composition. They identified epigenetic changes in over 2,000 sites in 1,962 genes linked with adipogenesis (formation of fat cells) and lipid (fat) metabolism in the children of fathers who gained weight as teenagers.

These changes in the way DNA is packaged in cells (methylation) regulate gene expression (switching them on and off) and are associated with asthma, obesity and lung function. The effect was more pronounced in female children than male children, with different genes involved.

The overweight status of future fathers during puberty was associated with a strong signal in their children's DNA which were also related to the likelihood of their children being overweight themselves. Early puberty, when boys start their developing sperm, seems to be a key window of vulnerability for lifestyle influences to drive epigenetic changes in future offspring.""

Dr. Negusse Tadesse Kitaba, Senior Research Fellow at the University of Southampton

Professor Cecilie Svanes from the University of Bergen says: ""The new findings have significant implications for public health and may be a game-changer in public health intervention strategies.""

""They suggest that a failure to address obesity in young teenagers today could damage the health of future generations, further entrenching health inequalities for decades to come.""

Prof John Holloway from the University of Southampton and the NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre added: ""Childhood obesity is increasing globally. The results of this study demonstrate that this is a concern not only for the health of the population now but also for generations to come.""

The research was funded by the Norwegian Research Council.

It's that time of year again. Throw on a tux, practice your fake smiles, heck, boycott it if you don't like your chances, because football's awards season is here.

To wrap up another season of following the Americans playing for clubs in Europe, we're dishing out gongs in a range of hotly contested categories.

So dim the stage lights, strike up the band and let's see who has won a coveted (ahem) Ballon d'Tracker. Sorry.

There's a forceful strand of logic that suggests this has to go to the USMNT's most high-profile, most naturally-gifted senior player, who has had another strong individual season at a top European club.

Despite Milan's troubled, mid-table campaign, Christian Pulisic (top left) has registered his highest tally of goals in a single season, and been a standout performer on several occasions. He has scored in a cup final to help his team win a trophy (their only one this term, January's SuperCoppa Italiana) and been Milan's most creative force.

But it's too easy to dish out the top award to Pulisic, especially in a season when Milan have not only failed to challenge for the Scudetto but missed out on any form of European qualification.

Instead, step forward one of the USMNT's younger playmakers: a midfielder who has ridden the ups and downs of injury to have a sensational solo season and end it with major domestic success.

Malik Tillman made his mark yet again during the thrilling climax of the Eredivisie in the Netherlands last weekend, scoring the third goal as PSV beat Sparta Rotterdam 3-1 and dramatically clinched the title after rivals Ajax stumbled.

It was the 22-year-old's 12th league goal of the season (he got 16 overall, including three in the Champions League) and made him second only to striker Luuk de Jong in the club's top-scorer chart.

Tillman's haul, especially for a midfielder, was even more impressive because it came in just 26 league games, with a serious ankle injury causing him to miss eight matches earlier this year.

But he recovered to play a crucial part in PSV's near flawless run-in, keeping Ajax under pressure in the top spot until eventually the Amsterdam side cracked, with Tillman getting five goals in that period. The big question now is whether the Dutch champions can keep hold of him.

Manager Peter Bosz is unlikely to let him go easily. “When you see him play, you remember what you missed for three months,” said the PSV coach after Tillman's full return in April, when he scored against Groningen. “I enjoyed him. He's a great player.”

It only lasted 13 minutes on a chilly night in Dortmund, but Cole Campbell will never forget November 5, 2024. That's when the then 18-year-old made his Champions League debut for one of Europe's top teams.

Following in the footsteps of Pulisic and Gio Reyna, the teenager from Houston was plunged into the spotlight as he came on for Borussia Dortmund against Sturm Graz in a 1-0 win during the competition's league phase.

Winger Campbell may not have gone on to become a first-team regular for the Bundesliga giant this term, but he made four league appearances too. That tally may have been greater were it not for an injury that caused him to miss 10 games since March.

Rumors of interest in Campbell from other German top-flight clubs have also surfaced this term, so it remains to be seen if he is loaned out for experience next season. But the 19-year-old signed a new deal in October keeping him at Signal Iduna Park until 2028, which underlines his promise.

“Cole is a very young and extremely exciting player, who took huge strides in the past year. We see so much potential in him,” Dortmund's sporting director, Sebastian Kehl, said at the time.

Goalkeeper: Matt Turner (pictured top with the trophy in goalkeeper gloves) hasn't played anywhere near as much football as he would have liked, but the USMNT No 1 played his part in Crystal Palace's FA Cup success, keeping two clean sheets in three games early in the competition as he deputized for Dean Henderson. Aside from the exciting young Barcelona prospect Diego Kochen, who didn't get any senior minutes this season, nobody is pushing Turner for his spot.

Left-back: One of the no-brainers. Fulham's European hopes may have fizzled out a touch as the Premier League reached its business end, but Antonee Robinson has been one of their standout performers all season. He has been one of the top-flight's best full-backs, and memorably shone against Mohamed Salah as Fulham held Liverpool to a draw in December.

Right-back: Richy Ledezma had the unenviable task of deputizing at PSV for the indomitable Sergino Dest for much of this season. And the Arizonan put in an impressive shift, making 38 appearances across all competitions as PSV successfully defended their crown.

Center-back: Chris Richards (pictured top with the trophy and US flag) became an integral part of Palace's three-man central defensive unit, culminating in Wembley glory. All power to him.

Center-back: Mark McKenzie has had a breakthrough season with Toulouse in Ligue 1 and, although Cameron Carter-Vickers won another title with Celtic in Scotland, McKenzie has flourished in a tougher division where he made 33 appearances across all competitions in his debut season in France.

Midfielder: Weston McKennie once again bounced back from a summer when he was briefly considered expendable at Juventus to become a major part of their team. As ever, he has also proved to be dependably flexible, playing in various positions.

Midfielder: Tanner Tessmann has shone in Lyon during his first campaign in Ligue 1, managing to break into their team despite a host of experienced central midfielders initially ahead of him. He also played his part as Lyon squeezed into qualification for Europe next season.

Midfielder: Pulisic. Obviously. He has become one of the top players a major European side relies on week in, week out. Milan are keen to tie him down to a new contract this summer.

Midfielder: This was close, but Tim Weah at Juventus edges into the team ahead of Milan's Yunus Musah, with more goals and assists than his compatriot.

Midfielder: We've sacrificed a striker to include Tillman, the Tracker's player of the season, but are confident his eye for goals will more than make up for any shortfall. His 0.24 Opta score for xAG (expected assisted goals) during the season put him in the 91st percentile of Eredivisie midfielders, underlining his creative potential.

Attacker: Josh Sargent couldn't fire Norwich City back into the Premier League but did finish as third-top-scorer in the second-tier EFL Championship despite an injury-hit campaign. Fifteen goals (and five assists) is no mean feat.

Everyone loves a feel-good story, and for most of the footballing world outside of Manchester, Crystal Palace's FA Cup win was just that. A first major trophy for a historic club who have long been in the shadow of London neighbours such as Arsenal and Chelsea.

But in the past year or so under new manager Oliver Glasner, Palace have been building to something, and this month their thrilling run in the cup ended the way every one of their fans dreamed about: in Wembley euphoria. For Chris Richards, it was also a major step in his blossoming Premier League career.

Richards became the first American to get his hands on the famous trophy in 21 years (Tim Howard lifted it in 2004 with Manchester United). He can also reflect on his progress since breaking into the Palace team, where he became a key performer in a mean defence alongside Maxence Lacroix and Marc Guehi. The USMNT should benefit from Richards' growing confidence and experience this summer, too.

It has largely been a season to forget for Gio Reyna, who must have felt at times like he was going backwards.

From being considered one of the Bundesliga's most exciting young talents in 2020-21, fast forward a few years and the 22-year-old managed just three starts for Dortmund all season. It didn't help that his club changed manager during the campaign, but it was telling that neither Nuri Sahin nor successor Niko Kovac were convinced.

The Champions League offered Reyna more encouragement: he made nine appearances in that competition compared with 16 across the whole Bundesliga season. But even those returns to Europe's elite did not shift the feeling that one of America's most natural talents in recent years has lost his way, and needs a fresh start elsewhere next season.

FIFA Club World Cup

Trent Alexander-Arnold is a Liverpool player until June 30.

But Real Madrid want their prospective new signing to line up for them in the Club World Cup, starting in mid-June.

Kevin De Bruyne is due to leave Manchester City as a free agent, also at the end of June. He has said he is unlikely to take part in the competition — but what if City decide they want him to play in FIFA's revamped tournament, which runs until mid-July?

To make its new-look flagship club competition run as smoothly as possible, world football's governing body has put in place some new rules and amended some old ones, meaning players and clubs could defy conventional logic and take part, when it might previously have seemed impossible.

FIFA has changed its normal rules, creating an extra transfer window to help clubs sign players in time for the Club World Cup.

Normally, the world governing body allows each member country to set dates for two transfer windows each year, one mainly in the close season and another in the middle of the season — the summer and winter windows for European clubs.

But with the redesigned tournament around the corner, FIFA has included a new regulation in the Club World Cup rules, allowing a short extra window at the start of June.

It reads: “Member associations of clubs participating in the competition shall have the possibility to establish an exceptional additional registration period from June 1-10, 2025. For the avoidance of doubt, no member association is obliged to establish such an exceptional additional registration period.”

But FIFA's rules mean member countries can only allow transfer business for 16 weeks a year, interpreted in Europe as four mid-season and 12 in the summer.

To keep the summer window open until September 1 as planned, European nations will close their transfer window for five days, reopening it from June 16.

And to prevent any unfair advantages, the extra transfer window will be open to all clubs, not just those involved in the Club World Cup.

Standard player contracts in Europe typically run from July 1 to June 30, meaning clubs involved in the Club World Cup could find themselves with players leaving as free agents during the tournament.

To help solve that issue, FIFA has added a mid-tournament registration window from June 27 to July 3, allowing clubs to replace out-of-contract players with players who might have joined at the end of their contracts elsewhere, or been bought from other clubs after the end of the extra transfer window.

But if clubs want to add players whose contracts are expiring in time for the start of the tournament, they would need to reach an agreement with the player's current club.

For example, Real Madrid want Alexander-Arnold for the whole Club World Cup but to get their wish they need to agree a conventional transfer with Liverpool.

In reality, that would almost certainly require only a nominal fee, as the player is of no value to Liverpool now their season has ended — they are not part of the inaugural Club World Cup — and allowing him to leave early would mean a relatively small but significant saving to the Merseyside club on the player's salary.

But if a deal could not be agreed, Madrid would have to wait until Alexander-Arnold becomes a free agent mid-tournament — although he could still be added to their squad for the knockout stages of the Club World Cup thanks to the registration window.

For De Bruyne and other players who will reach the end of their contracts with Club World Cup sides during the tournament, the issue is different.

If the Belgian finds a new club before the end of his deal but decides he does want to represent City and see out the tournament, he would need to reach an agreement with his new club to sign a short-term extension at the Etihad, encompassing the first two weeks of July.

But any agreement would be complicated by the possibility of players being injured during the competition — something De Bruyne himself spoke about after the FA Cup final, telling The Athletic: “I think in a way I have to take care of myself because if I get injured in the Club World Cup, what am I going to do? Nobody's going to take care of me at that point. So there's a big chance probably that I won't play it, but I don't know, maybe yes.”

Players cannot play for more than one club in the Club World Cup so De Bruyne, for example, could not start with Manchester City and end it playing for another side, even if he signed for another Club World Cup participant during the competition.

Clubs can also add two extra players to the squad during the mid-tournament registration window, potentially taking their squad size from 35 up to 37. But clubs can make a maximum of six changes to their squad overall.

And for a new player to take part in a Club World Cup match, his new club must have registered him and notified FIFA at least 48 hours before kick-off.

The Club World Cup is exempt from FIFA rules stating players cannot play for more than two clubs in a single season, so a player who has represented two clubs during a domestic season could play for a third team in the tournament.

FIFA has also changed its rules compelling clubs involved in the Club World Cup to release players for international duty.

The tournament regulations say Club World Cup participants are exempt but must still release their players for the international window that runs from June 2-10, immediately before the tournament begins.

In reality, however, the only international fixtures that clash with the Club World Cup come at the Concacaf Gold Cup, also being held in the United States as well as Canada.

So ‘only' the 16 nations from North and Central America and the Caribbean are potentially affected.

Clubs have been asked to submit a provisional list of up to 50 players, which will be whittled down to a final list of 35 before the tournament begins.

Goalkeepers can be replaced by another of their club's players at any stage in the tournament if proof of serious injury or illness is provided.

Talks have been held about Cristiano Ronaldo playing in next month's Club World Cup; the tournament begins in Miami on June 15; Ronaldo hinted he was leaving Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr on Monday after posting a cryptic message on social media; mini-transfer window set for June 1-10

Al Nassr forward Cristiano Ronaldo could be set for a last-minute transfer to play in the Club World Cup next month.

The new expanded 32-team FIFA tournament starts in Miami on June 15.

Ronaldo's great rival Lionel Messi is playing for Inter Miami and is due to feature in the opening game against Egypt's Al Ahly SC.

Having Ronaldo play would be a major boost for the organisers - and ticket sales - for the controversial month-long tournament.

Several sources have confirmed that talks have been held about Ronaldo playing in the United States but they did not want to comment on the record.

The new format is being held every four years, so, at 40, this would appear to be Ronaldo's last chance to play in it.

Ronaldo hinted that he was leaving Al Nassr last night after their final game of the Saudi Pro League season.

In a cryptic post on X, he wrote: ""The chapter is over. The story? Still being written. Grateful to all"".

Al Nassr are not playing in the Club World Cup but their Riyadh rivals Al Hilal are representing Saudi Arabia and they are joined by two of Ronaldo's former clubs, Real Madrid and Juventus. Real Madrid's opening game is against Al Hilal in Miami on June 18.

Ronaldo's Al Nassr contract, which is believed to be worth more than £170m a year, runs out at the end of next month.

Ronaldo could use the special transfer window set up by FIFA between June 1-10 to sign for a new club.

Clubs can also use an in-tournament registration period from June 27 - July 3 (after the group stages) to add players to their squads.

Brazilian club Botafogo, who became champions of South America in December, are reported to be willing to sign Ronaldo on a short-term contract. They are in Group B with Paris Saint-Germain, Atletico Madrid and Seattle Sounders.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in an interview last week that talks were being held about Ronaldo playing in the United States next month.

""Ronaldo might play for one of the teams as well at the Club World Cup,"" Infantino said. ""There are discussions with some clubs, so if any club is watching and is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup... who knows, who knows?""

From next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.

And 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports.

If Cristiano Ronaldo does exit Al Nassr, could he play with Miami's Lionel Messi or another team at the FIFA Club World Cup, starting June 14 in the US?

Cristiano Ronaldo has hinted that he will quit his club team Al Nassr, possibly ending his association with the lucrative Saudi Pro League.

The 40-year-old Portugal striker announced only hours after his club's final match of the season that “This chapter is over” via his account on the social media platform X.

The post included a picture of him in an Al Nassr jersey and concluded: “The story? Still being written. Grateful to all.”

Speculation has now moved into overdrive about where the former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus forward will move next.

Al Jazeera takes a look at what might occur in the coming days and possible options ahead for a player who remains one of world football's most bankable assets.

Ronaldo joined Al Nassr from Manchester United in January 2023 in a move that shocked the world.

The five-time world player of the year was the marquee signing that the Saudi Pro League needed to elevate its global standing.

His lucrative two-and-a-half-year deal, estimated to have been worth 200 million euros ($214.5m), comes to an end in June but was widely expected to be renewed.

Al Nassr have failed to win any titles in Ronaldo's time at the club and disappointingly have missed out on a place at both the FIFA Club World Cup and the Asian Champions League, having finished third in the league this season.

A place in the Asian Champions League Two is now the best they can hope for via a playoff.

Yes. The 32 teams involved in the Club World Cup have been granted a special transfer window to sign players.

It runs June 1-10 just before the tournament in the United States begins on June 14 when Inter Miami face Al Ahly.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino revealed last week that “there are discussions” surrounding Ronaldo playing at the enlarged and rebranded tournament.

1. Real Madrid

Ronaldo became a Galactico when he joined the Spanish giants from Manchester United in 2009 for what was then a world record fee of 80 million euros ($91m).

Even a short-term move back to Real for the tournament is unlikely given the struggles Los Blancos had in finding the best way for Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo to line up as the front three as Real tried to defend its Champions League and La Liga titles.

With Jude Bellingham already having to adapt to a new role last season given Mbappe's arrival from Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), it is difficult to envisage a Real return for Ronaldo.

Another of his former clubs at the tournament is Juventus, again at least offering the option of an emotional reunion. But because such a move would be only a short-term one, Juventus are unlikely to want to upset the playing group that qualified them for the tournament.

2. Inter Miami

The biggest headline move would undoubtedly be for a link-up with Ronaldo's career-long rival for the title of the best player in the world, Lionel Messi.

The Argentinian forward left Paris Saint-Germain to join the David Beckham co-owned Major League Soccer (MLS) side in 2023.

It was a sensational score for Miami as Ronaldo himself had also been linked with a move to the MLS before joining Al Nassr.

If Ronaldo's participation at the Club World Cup is seen as a boost to the competition by Infantino and FIFA, then clearly there would be no bigger headline-grabber than a link-up between two players that between them have shared the title of world player of the year on 13 occasions.

Last week, when he was asked if Inter Miami might sign Ronaldo, Infantino laughed and replied: “It's possible.”

3. Al Hilal

A strong contender for Ronaldo's signature, both in the short and long term, is 2023-2024 Saudi Pro League winners, Al Hilal.

The move makes a lot of sense to all parties. The marquee signing for the Saudi domestic league remains in the competition, plays in the Club World Cup and will spearhead the Saudi assault for next season's Asian Champions League.

For Ronaldo, it would mean staying in the Saudi capital, where many of his current business and commercial interests are based.

The other options in the region who are also represented at the Club World Cup are Al Ain from the United Arab Emirates and a switch to challenge for the African Champions League next season with Egyptian giants Al Ahly. The loss of Ronaldo to a neighbouring football nation is surely something the Saudi Pro League would prefer to avoid.

4. Botafogo

The Spanish newspaper Marca reported last week that Ronaldo is in talks with the Brazilian mega-club Botafogo.

That news made a lot of sense at the time because they could potentially afford a short-term deal with Ronaldo. However, that news came before the player's announcement that his time with Al Nassr might have come to an end.

A long-term move to Brazil, despite its footballing heritage and legacy, appears unlikely. A short-term deal remains an option unless it interferes with a move to a Club World Cup participant that would want a contract beyond the end of the competition.

Palmeiras, Fluminense and Flamengo are also representing the Brazilian top flight at the tournament.

5. Seattle Sounders

One move that would perhaps offer the cleanest solution to Ronaldo's appearance at the Club World Cup is to sign a long-term deal with one of the US-based participants.

Much like the Saudi Pro League's desire to elevate their exposure, the MLS would be significantly boosted by Ronaldo's signature – be it in a link-up with Messi or in opposition to the Argentinian on an opposing side.

A move to the Seattle Sounders, the MLS champions, would also bring credibility to his appearance in the competition as part of a longer potential plan to base himself in the US.

The thrill of a potential Messi and Ronaldo link-up at the Club World Cup goes beyond the positional play of the pair, but that too would be a huge talking point were a collaboration at Inter Miami to be arranged.

Messi's preference is to play either on the right, cutting in on his famed left foot, or in a deeper role through the middle with the team playing around him.

Ronaldo, who began on the left flank, now operates solely through the middle but in a more advanced position to that preferred by Messi.

Both scenarios could work, but both would result in Messi making runs into the area of the field occupied by Ronaldo, and that is where the on-field viability of a potential partnership would be questioned.

The pair have long been rivals for the famed Ballon d'Or title, making the annual award ceremony to name the best player in the world an often tense affair.

The debate as to who was the better player at their peak raged through their time in La Liga with Messi at Barcelona and Ronaldo at Real Madrid.

It was often a conversation that the pair would cryptically contribute to over the years while there was noticeably no love lost when the duo would meet on the field of play.

A partnership at the Club World Cup would be one of the biggest box office events in football history and would draw much needed attention to the competition.

Whether their longstanding rivalry and differences could be put to one side would be the biggest hurdle to perhaps the greatest matchup in the sport's history.

Cristiano Ronaldo looks likely to join a club taking part in the Club World Cup amid growing uncertainty as to whether he will quit the Saudi Pro-League (SPL).

Negotiations over an extended contract with his club, Al-Nassr, have been ongoing for months without resolution and Ronaldo has added to speculation with a post on social media.

The SPL is yet to be informed of Ronaldo's final decision but there is a sense of resignation that he may have chosen to leave.

“This chapter is over. The story? Still being written. Grateful to all,” the 40-year-old posted on Monday evening, which would suggest he is parting ways with Al-Nassr.

The Saudi club made him the best-paid player in world football when he moved from Manchester United in January 2023.

A post shared by Cristiano Ronaldo (@cristiano)

Ronaldo is out of contract next month but Fifa president Gianni Infantino suggested in an interview with YouTuber and streamer IShowSpeed that the Portuguese could be involved in the Club World Cup.

“Ronaldo might play for one of the teams as well at the Club World Cup,” Infantino said. “There are discussions with some clubs, so if any club is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup… who knows, who knows.”

The 32-team competition, in which Manchester City and Chelsea will take part, is being held in the United States and, under its new format and associated $1 billion prize fund, is a huge flagship event for Fifa. Al-Nassr did not qualify, leaving Al-Hilal as Saudi Arabia's sole representatives.

The expectation is that Ronaldo may be planning to leave Al-Nassr and will sign a short-term deal with one of the clubs taking part in the Club World Cup before assessing his future and deciding where he wants to play next season.

Fifa has opened a special 10-day transfer window at the beginning of June to allow clubs to recruit for the competition and are keen for Ronaldo to be involved to help raise its profile.

There is concern about the level of interest with tickets still on general sale for most games including the opening fixture on June 14 between Lionel Messi's Inter Miami and Al-Ahly.

Inter Miami are only involved because Infantino changed the rules to allow Messi's club to qualify.

If Ronaldo does play at the Club World Cup he is unlikely to do so for a European club. There is interest from Wydad, the Moroccan side who are in the same group as City, as well as from Mexican side Monterrey, where Ronaldo's former Real Madrid team-mate and friend Sergio Ramos plays. There have also been links to Brazil.

What will be of greater interest is where Ronaldo goes from here should he leave Saudi, given that he is expected to continue playing.

Ronaldo scored the 800th club goal of his career – and the 936th overall – as Al-Nassr ended the season with 3-2 defeat by Al-Fateh to finish the season in third place in the SPL. He was, once again, the league's top-scorer.

Ronaldo has set his sights on reaching 1,000 goals and appearing in next year's World Cup.

The Wydad Athletic Club, also known as Wydad or WAC, would appear to be one of the favourites to sign Ronaldo. The Moroccan side are based in Casablanca and are the most successful in the North African country. They qualified after winning the African Champions League in 2022 and will be in the same group as Manchester City, Juventus and Al-Ain from the United Arab Emirates. They recently signed three new players, including former Watford and Hull City winger Nordin Amrabat, and hired a new coach to prepare for the Club World Cup.

The Mexican giants already boast Ronaldo's former Real Madrid team-mate and friend Sergio Ramos in their squad along with another former Real player, midfielder Sergio Canales. They hope the link to Ramos may persuade Ronaldo to join them. Monterrey qualified by winning the Concacaf Champions League in 2021 and are in the same group as Inter Milan. They, too, have recently hired a new head coach – Domenec Torrent, whose previous roles include being Pep Guardiola's assistant at Manchester City.

One of four Brazilian clubs at the Club World Cup, they have been handed a difficult draw alongside Paris St-Germain and Atletico Madrid. The Rio de Janeiro-based team qualified by winning last year's Copa Libertadores and are believed to have been the first to make a move for Ronaldo. John Textor, the Botafogo owner and a significant shareholder in Crystal Palace who tried to buy Everton last year, is understood to be driving the deal. Their squad includes Alex Telles who played with Ronaldo at Manchester United and also Al-Nassr.

Saudi Arabia's only representative at the Club World Cup would appear an unlikely destination but there has been talk that, given how much money is tied up with the kingdom and Fifa, it could happen. Al-Hilal are the most successful club in Saudi, although they have lost the title this season. They have been drawn alongside Real Madrid and qualified by winning the 2021 AFC Champions League. They have been trying to hire Fulham's Marco Silva as their new coach but he wants to stay in the Premier League. Their squad includes former Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic and a host of other former Premier League players.

Portugal icon Cristiano Ronaldo indicated on Monday that he could leave Al-Nassr after declaring that a ""chapter is over"" hours after the Saudi Pro League finished. Ronaldo, 40, joined Al-Nassr in 2022 from Manchester United and his contract in Saudi Arabia ends this summer. A special transfer window runs from June 1-10 to allow the 32 clubs involved in the Club World Cup to sign players. The iconic goalscorer is said to be in talks with a few clubs over a switch ahead of the start of the Club World Cup.

""This chapter is over,"" Ronaldo cryptically said on social media with a photo of him in an Al-Nassr shirt.

""The story? Still being written. Grateful to all,"" the former Real Madrid and Juventus attacker added.

Al-Nassr missed out on the Asian Champions League Elite, losing to Japan's Kawasaki Frontale in April's semi-finals and were third in the Saudi Pro League.

Ronaldo ended as the league's top goal scorer on 24.

Last year, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said he could end his career wit Al-Nassr.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino had earlier suggested that Ronaldo might indeed feature in the Club World Cup, hinting at the possibility of a deal between the Portuguese superstar and a few interested clubs. Infantino's comments received plenty of backlash, but it seems like something indeed is cooking between Ronaldo and certain clubs participating in the Club World Cup, set to be held in June.

""Ronaldo might play for one of the teams as well at the Club World Cup. There are discussions with some clubs, so if any club is watching and is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup... who knows, who knows,"" he had said.

The prospect of seeing the Club World Cup feature both Ronaldo and Messi is indeed enticing to many. It would be the first time that the FIFA Club World Cup will be played din the summer, with 32 teams participating.

                        The Club World Cup, Henry Pollock and Ethan de Groot is discussed in Loose Pass.                    

This week we will mostly be concerning ourselves with the latest twist in the competitive landscape, the rise of Henry Pollock, and the latest judicial mis-steps…

It is difficult to imagine a better finale to the European season than the weekend just past. Tries, tackles, skills, talking points, free-flowing liquid refreshment and two worthy winners from two different countries.

How many of those supporters who watched on Friday night doubled up (as some tickets can do) on Saturday is unknown, but there was a combined attendance over the two matches of 107,000 people drawn from the four cities of participants and the small but indomitable throng of the disappointed from other clubs.

Yet while the finale was grand indeed, this column has repeatedly noted that the tweaks and re-boots of European rugby competition have somewhat eroded from the foundations of the success European rugby competition had originally been built on. Less jeopardy. More opportunities to field weakened teams. Ludicrous travel schedules. Teams making it through to the second phase despite only winning one of four pool matches. Knockout rounds featuring impossible logistics for fans and limited competitiveness. And such.

Still, at least the semi-finals and finals were both intensely competitive, brightly colourful and excellent occasions, throwbacks to the better days.

Except that from 2028, even those grand finales will be taken away from us. Because of the desire to have something even grander, bolder, bigger. Always bigger. Because in 2028, even conquering Europe and South Africa will not be enough, now you'll have to get past the Kiwis and Aussies and Japanese as well.

Idle bar chat has existed for yonks about how well the Toulouses, Bordeauxs, Northamptons and Leinsters of this world would match up against the Brumbies, Crusaders and… well, I guess the Saitama Wild Knights perhaps (?) in some tournament somewhere. Now we have that tournament. It's at the expense of Europe's grandest non-international occasion. And while interesting in the bar, we're not sure if watching Leinster take on travel-weary Brumbies in Marseille is actually going to be better than watching the knockout rounds in the Champions Cup. Or, for that matter, if European sides ended up trying for a win in an Otago winter somewhere down the line.

The worst thing about this new tournament – and the list is extensive – is that it has left us with the parts of the existing tournament we didn't like so much, and taken away the good parts to foist upon us something entirely devoid of the tradition, colour and history that makes European rugby such good fun. In a close second place for bad things comes the thought that this might be some form of answer back to FIFA's horribly-conceived Club World Cup to take place this year, which is enjoying, at best, a lukewarm reception. The same argument applies though: if you want to compete, do what you are best at. European rugby took time to bed in, but seven or eight years after its inception, we were all hooked.

Who's hot and who's not: Bordeaux and Bath celebrate but Henry Pollock mocking goes ‘too far' while All Black delivers ‘cowardly cheap shot'

Champions Cup Team of the Season: ‘Precious talent' sends Test message in road to glory while Henry Pollock rewarded for breakthrough season

Rugby does history and colour very, very well. It does not do global sporting domination and contrived, vanilla, mass-market appeal.

As a wise old man, who has been involved in the game for 81 of his 86 years explained to Loose Pass on Saturday after enjoying the Final: “I've never been so disillusioned. Weird new competitions everywhere with no meaning. Tours replaced by competitions that might last beyond my remaining years. Now they are fiddling with the Six Nations. Now the European Cup is going to be replaced. You don't know what to watch any more, or why. And all for money, not to make the rugby better. Why can't they just sit back and enjoy it, like we're always trying to do?”

If Henry Pollock did not consider that his somewhat extrovert presence in the rugbyverse around the world, replete with plentiful soundbite interviews, idiosyncratic scoring celebrations and full-on attention-loving presence everywhere, would make him a target, then someone is not doing their job.

It was good of his team-mates to back him when, apparently, the Bordeaux players went hunting for him at the final whistle on Saturday. But it's getting to the stage where club and country need to manage it a little more proportionately. Would it do anybody any harm if one of the older heads at Northampton had a little word? If the media people were to be perhaps encouraged to go looking for soundbites from someone else? If someone were perhaps to hint to him gently that the more he remains in his cage – in non-rugby activities at least – the less likely people are to want to rattle it?

It used to only be Owen Farrell and the RFU who got away with stunts like this, but the decision not even to take Ethan de Groot to task over his head-butt last weekend in Super Rugby Pacific is far, far beyond mystifying.

There's not a universe in which that movement was not intentional, in which that contact was not significant, in which that action was not clear and obvious even in real time. Getting away with it free as a bird makes even Sam Underhill look like an angel. It's a staggering miscarriage of justice by the NZRU and World Rugby, which does have previous in appealing non-decisions by judiciaries, needs to have a look at it.

Brazil forward Neymar believes the 2026 World Cup in North America could change the way football is experienced.

Next year's tournament will be held in Canada, the United States and Mexico, with the final played at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

""You'll see what the World Cup will be like,"" Neymar told Disney+.

""I think it's going to be crazy! I think it could change things! It's good for everyone!""

Neymar, who is a big fan of the NBA, was the special guest during the Disney+ broadcast of Game 4 of the NBA Western Conference Finals between the Minnesota Timberwolves and Oklahoma City Thunder.

The Santos star said he enjoys the entertainment and atmosphere at sports events in North America, something that football around the world has yet to catch up to.

""You don't go to a basketball game [NBA] just to watch a basketball game,"" he said.

""There's a show. There's a break, people come out dancing. Then there's another break, fans come out shooting hoops. Before the game, someone really famous sings the national anthem.

""They make it worth your while to go. If you take that as a reference, it's good for Brazil. In soccer, you have a 90-minute game and there's nothing during halftime. Everyone goes to the stadium gates to hang out. Why not inside the stadium? Do something different?

""Entertainment can be used in many ways. And without detracting from everyone's focus.""

If fit, Neymar, is expected to play in next year's World Cup if Brazil qualify.

The 33-year-old has played in three World Cups and is Brazil's all-time leading scorer with 79 goals.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Tesla teased a new color that could be coming to the United States with the new Model S and Model X.

Tesla appears to be teasing a brand new color while it was testing the refreshed Model S and Model X, which was spotted last week in California.

Tesla currently offers six paint options in the United States, but they are all pretty basic. This has not been a problem for owners as wrapping the vehicles is a common practice, but some people would likely see more versatility from Tesla in terms of their standard paint colors.

This is especially relevant as Europe has been able to have both Midnight Cherry Red and Quicksilver, which were, at one time, exclusive to the market.

Quicksilver made its way to the United States, and Tesla did release a new Red last year with “Ultra Red,” but Midnight Cherry Red never made its way outside the walls of Gigafactory Berlin.

Last week, as the first spy images of the new Model S and Model X were taken and released by The Kilowatts, there was a very noticeable difference with the vehicle, as other changes seemed to be relatively underwhelming: a new paint color.

Many believed this was simply a wrap, but Ryan Levenson of The Kilowatts, a former Tesla employee, dispelled that rumor after several questions about it.

He said that this is absolutely a factory paint color and not a wrap:

Tesla released a new color earlier this year, but it was just a revision to Black, now called “Diamond Black,” featuring speckles that give a reflection and refraction of light as a diamond would.

However, this new color is certainly quite different than anything Tesla has previously offered in the U.S. before. It is relatively similar to Glacier Blue, a color Tesla launched in Asia. Earlier this year, Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla's Chief Designer, talked about bringing the color to the U.S.:

“Glacier Blue is just a color that we've been talking about with our team — the team is like right through that window by the way — and we were looking at the impact of silver, how do we get pigment into silver and really add a little bit of personality to it. If you look at our palette, you know it was either darks or white, and so we were looking for something in between. Blue is always a fairly popular color.”

It would be a refreshing addition to the options Tesla currently offers, and a breath of fresh air for those who have been wanting a different look altogether.

Mark Cuban said this simple Tesla feature will eventually lead to him selling the car.

Known Elon Musk critic Mark Cuban is ready to sell his Tesla because of a simple feature that is one of the more polarizing amongst community members.

Cuban and Musk have gone head-to-head in several back-and-forths on X, Musk's social media platform, formerly Twitter. However, it is not the public spats that the two have shared that makes Cuban want to sell his car. In fact, it is something relatively trivial and a feature that many could easily adjust to in the matter of a few minutes of driving.

For the entrepreneur and former owner of the Dallas Mavericks, it is a feature that every driver must use, but Tesla temporarily changed it in the Model 3, Model S, and Model X: the turn signal.

With the refreshed versions of the S, 3, and X, Tesla chose to eliminate the turn signal stalk, instead opting for a turn signal button, which is located on the steering wheel. This was a change that was extremely polarizing among the Tesla community, with many requesting that the company reverse the change with the new Model Y.

They listened, and the newest version of the all-electric crossover has a stalk. No turn signal haptics are available on the new Model Y.

This is one feature Cuban said he cannot get into, and instead chooses to drive his Kia EV6, which he said he is “comfortable with.”

On the Your Mom's House podcast, Cuban commented on the stalk and turn signal button dilemma within the vehicle:

“On the Tesla, you've got to find [the turn signal] and push the button…while you're driving. You can't pay attention to the road as much. [The Kia] doesn't try to be too fancy. Your turn signal is like, a turn signal.”

It's hard to imagine that someone's attention is taken away from the road when pushing a button. In my test drive of the new Model 3 last year, I noted that the button was definitely an adjustment, but it only took a few minutes to adjust to:

“It only took me about three or four turns, or roughly ten minutes, to realize I needed to stop reaching for stalks. I feel like the buttons are super convenient, but there were times I would push the edges or corners, and the signal would not come on.”

I drove the new Tesla Model 3, here's what got better



At least to me, it's not super believable that pushing a turn signal button takes your attention away from the road for more than a split second. Do I like the traditional stalk more? Yes. However, it would not make me sell a car I really enjoyed driving.

Cuban also said that his son called the EV6 “a nerd car,” to which he replied, “Exactly.”

A tax on vehicles in the United Kingdom is set to be adjusted after automakers have blamed it for struggling sales.

Published

A controversial tax set on cars that are above the £40,000 price threshold in the United Kingdom could be abandoned, as the “Tesla Tax,” as it is commonly referred to, is taking the blame for poor EV sales.

The tax has been imposed on ICE vehicles since 2017, but on April 1, 2025, the “Expensive Car Supplement,” or ECS, was applied to new EVs sold after that date, a move that was initiated in an act of fairness.

Tesla best-rated car brand in UK, beats Toyota in reliability: survey



However, the tax is now being blamed for sluggish EV sales across various parts of Europe. In the UK, manufacturers are blaming the tax for making it more difficult to reach sales quantities for binding green car sales targets. Missing these sales goals could cost manufacturers millions or even billions of dollars.

A leaked letter seen by This Is Money and MailOnline shows the UK is ready to reconsider the tax, which is combined with a Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) on cars in the second year after they are registered.

The tax could be applied to vehicles at a higher price point, or it could be eliminated altogether. However, Ben Maguire, a Lib Dem MP for one region in the UK, said:

“We will consider raising the threshold for zero-emission cars only at a future fiscal event to make it easier to buy electric cars.”

Several companies said an adjustment to the tax would be “a move in the right direction,” and one of the major new car retailers in the UK said sales targets are “unrealistic” with the tax currently set at where it is.

UK reconsiders EV sales targets, listening to automakers



Even still, without the adjustment, retailers are concerned that EVs are not at a spot where consumers truly can justify them as a purchase. One company said “cost, lack of incentives, and lack of a public charging infrastructure” are the biggest bottlenecks in the adoption of EVs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Saudi official denies that alcohol ban will be lifted ahead of World Cup","https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/saudi-official-denies-alcohol-ban-will-be-lifted-ahead-world-cup","Tue, 27 May 2025 10:06:03 GMT","

Saudi Arabia has denied reports that it will lift a long-standing ban on alcohol in the Gulf kingdom ahead of the 2034 World Cup. 

Several international media outlets reported this week that Saudi authorities were planning to allow alcohol sales in tourist settings. 

The report first appeared on a wine blog last week, but did not cite a source. 

It had claimed that the 73-year-old ban would be lifted on wine, beer and cider in licensed venues including luxury hotels, five-star resorts and tourist developments. 

On Monday, a Saudi official denied the reports to Reuters. An informed source aware of the matter told Arab News: “These claims lack any official confirmation from relevant authorities and do not reflect existing policies or regulations in Saudi Arabia.”

While alcohol remains banned, there has been a relaxing of some social norms since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman launched the Vision 2030 strategy nine years ago. 

The initiative seeks to move the kingdom away from oil reliance and improve its reputation around the world. 

Since it began, music festivals, fashion shows and cinemas have been legalised in the country. 

A ban on women driving was also lifted in 2017, and there was easing of gender segregation in some public spaces. 

Last year, the first alcohol store in Riyadh was opened, to serve non-Muslim diplomats. Prior to that, it was only available through the black market or diplomatic mail. 

The source told Arab News that the move was aimed at preventing the unauthorised use of diplomatic shipments, and control the use of alcohol under strict regulatory guidelines. 

In December, Saudi Arabia was unveiled as the host of the 2034 World Cup.

Its Gulf neighbour Qatar hosted the tournament in 2022. While it did not allow the sale of alcohol in stadiums during the tournament, it was sold in special fan zones. 

Prince Khalid bin Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the UK, said in February that alcohol wouldn't be available in the stands for the 2034 tournament.

“Rather like our weather, it's a dry country,” he said. “Everyone has their own culture, and we're happy to accommodate people within the boundaries of ours, but we don't want to change our culture for someone else.”

State officials will spend $33 million on a new walkway between American Dream Mall and MetLife Stadium before the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The bridge aims to move a million visitors during the games.

""You don't need to bring a cooler full of beer. Why don't you come over to our restaurants and have a great meal?"" said Paul Ghermezian, a senior executive with Triple Five, to NorthJersey.com.

The 3-million-square-foot site will test its plans during this summer's FIFA Club World Cup. Watch parties, activities, and food specials will run at 11 spots across the mall.

Staff must stay quick on their feet. With Club World Cup matchups announced in late June, they'll have mere days to set up if stars like Lionel Messi play at MetLife.

Past big events show what works. The site drew crowds for U.S. curling matches in 2024. Last summer, the Harlem Globetrotters packed the house.

Charles Cristella from JLL sees no issues with World Cup-sized groups. ""They are very well-suited. This is what this company does. They build massive projects and they appeal to massive crowds, and they know how to handle it,"" he told NorthJersey.com.

Past soccer events paint the picture. For Copa America 2023, video games filled the space while DJs spun tracks through a Univision deal. Back in 2022, skaters gave way to soccer players when the FIFA Trophy Tour came through.

MetLife Stadium will host key matches, with the finals set for July 19, 2026. The stadium fits 82,000 fans.

Visitors find more than 200 shops and 50 food spots inside. Water slides splash next to ski slopes, while skaters spin near thrill rides. Soccer-themed shops will pop up before kickoff, though which ones stays under wraps.

Which players did themselves proud in the Red Devils' worst-ever Premier League season? And who were the biggest disappointments?

Well, at least it's over now. Manchester United's 2024-25 season has been an ordeal no one should have ever had to put up with. It ended with the team languished in 15th in the Premier League table, their lowest finish in the league's history and their worst showing since they were last relegated from the top flight in 1974.

It was not just the final league position that made for grim reading, though. The Red Devils lost 18 of their 38 matches and had a goal difference of minus 10, finishing on just 42 points. Last season eighth-placed finish was a catastrophe, but compared to this one, it looks fantastic.

Erik ten Hag lasted nine matches before he was sacked in October, only four months after being handed a contract extension. Interim coach Ruud van Nistelrooy was unbeaten in his four matches in charge and there was plenty of hope that Ruben Amorim would be able to turn United around after successfully waking another sleeping giant in Sporting CP. The Portuguese talked a good gamem but the team could not adapt to his 3-4-2-1 formation, and Amorim was not ready to compromise. 

United's FA Cup defence ended in the fifth round with a penalty shootout defeat at home to Fulham while they were knocked out of the Carabao Cup in the quarter-finals by Tottenham, a team that would end up haunting them like no one else. The only positive aspect of this harrowing campaign was the Europa League campaign, and United fans will never forget what they were doing when Harry Maguire completed the most epic of extra-time comebacks against Lyon. Amorim's team also produced two excellent performances against Athletic Club in the semi-final, but when they returned to Bilbao for the final, they froze and were out-fought by Tottenham, who nicked the golden ticket of Champions League qualification from their grasp.

 Grigor Dimitrov's Roland Garros campaign ended in cruel fashion on Tuesday afternoon, when the 16th-seed was forced to withdraw from his first-round clash against Ethan Quinn due to injury. 

 Dimitrov led qualifier Quinn 6-2, 6-3, 2-6 at the clay-court major before shaking hands with the American. The Bulgarian had taken control of the pair's maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting but received treatment on his left thigh in the second set, and his movement was hindered throughout the third set.

 Now 14-10 for the 2025 season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Dimitrov is No. 19 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. He is at risk of falling out of the Top 20 after Roland Garros, depending on other results. The 2017 Nitto ATP Finals champion has not been outside the Top 20 since July 2023. 
 Roland Garros debutant Quinn, who is competing in Paris at a career-high World No. 106, will take on Alexander Shevchenko in the second round, after the Kazakhstani earlier defeated Dusan Lajovic 6-2, 6-4, 7-6(4). Should the 21-year-old Quinn triumph in that match, he would be well-placed to crack the Top 100 for the first time after Roland Garros.

Hugo Gaston withdrew from Roland Garros on Tuesday due to abdominal pain. His scheduled second-round opponent, Ben Shelton, advances to the third round.

In the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, which came last year in the first round of Roland Garros, Shelton won in four sets. Gaston will not be able to level their series this tournament.

The Frenchman rallied from two sets to one down in the first round against countryman Ugo Blanchet to triumph in five sets. In his post-match press conference, he did not reference the abdominal pain.



Shelton, who ousted Lorenzo Sonego in his opener, will compete in the third round at the clay-court major for the second consecutive year and will try to make the fourth round on the Parisian clay for the first time. The 13th seed will take on 20th seed Stefanos Tsitsipas or Italian Matteo Gigante.

If Shelton advances, he will have reached at least the fourth round at all four Grand Slam tournaments. The lefty is a two-time major semi-finalist, including a trip to the last four of the Australian Open earlier this year.

 Another year, another impressive start from Novak Djokovic at Roland Garros. 

 The three-time champion at the clay-court major kick-started his 2025 campaign on Tuesday with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 triumph against Mackenzie McDonald. Djokovic, competing just three days after he lifted his 100th tour-level title at the Gonet Geneva Open, was solid in all facets of his game during a clinical one-hour, 58-minute display inside Court Philippe-Chatrier. 

Straight down to business 🔥@DjokerNole powers past McDonald 6-3 6-3 6-3 to reach R2 at #RolandGarros 💪@rolandgarros pic.twitter.com/EKVQpf2h3d

 With victory in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash against McDonald, Djokovic improved to 20-0 in first-round matches at Roland Garros. The 38-year-old has not lost a set in a Paris opener since he needed four sets to overcome Evgeny Korolev in 2010. 

 “I try to enjoy every moment on this very special and beautiful court,” said Djokovic in French in his on-court interview. “I feel good, clearly, even more here because I'm reliving the memories of last year's Olympics, the last time I played on this court. [They are] beautiful emotions. 

 “It was a solid match. I know that he can play to a better standard than today, but I am very happy with what I produced.”

 Djokovic and McDonald started their match as strong gusts blew across Court Philippe-Chatrier, and the roof was eventually closed early in the second set when rain also began to fall. By that stage, the No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings Djokovic had established a commanding lead after winning six of seven games from 2-2 in the first set. 
 While McDonald battled hard and claimed what would prove to be his only break of Djokovic's serve to reduce his second-set deficit to 3-5, the American was unable to match his opponent's consistent, deep baseline hitting. Djokovic promptly broke in the next game to clinch the second set, and then eased through the third to complete victory having converted five of nine break points he earned, according to Infosys Stats. 

 Djokovic last year reached the quarter-finals at Roland Garros before withdrawing due to a knee injury. He returned to the venue later in the year to claim an Olympic gold medal, and will face Corentin Moutet or qualifier Clement Tabur in the second round at this edition of the clay-court major. 
 “History in this sport has given me everything in my life, it means a lot to me,” said Djokovic, who has won a record 24 Grand Slam men's singles titles. “I always try to make history where I can… In all the tournaments I play, all the practises, all the matches, and especially during the biggest tournaments in the world. There is an opportunity to make more history, and that is one of the biggest motivations I have for competitions, for continuing to work and better myself.”

Daniil Medvedev pulled out all the stops, even a mid-match switch of strings, but not even drastic measures could save him from an early exit at Roland Garros.

The 11th seed fell to a first-round defeat to Cameron Norrie on Tuesday, failing to serve out the match at 5-4 in the fifth set. Medvedev later revealed that he changed his string setup during the match, a tactic he once avoided but has now adopted.

“Until 2023, I [had] never done it,” said Medvedev when asked of the change. “Something started to change on Tour, I had to adapt. Now I'm never sure. I played Karen [Khachanov in Doha]. During the match, I see that I'm not going to win. So I changed my strings to completely different strings and I win the match…

“Every tournament is so different. This one is so different from Rome and Madrid. [The] clay, the balls, everything. I had one week here. I didn't find anything that worked well. So during the match, I had to change something when I was losing. It actually worked. Unfortunately I didn't win.”

The drastic change seemed to have paid off after Medvedev had rallied from two sets down to give himself the opportunity to serve for the match. Yet the former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings stumbled in an error-strewn finish, falling to his sixth first-round defeat at Roland Garros.
“It was kind of more loose before and the ones that I took after were less loose,” Medvedev explained. “I could hit a bit more and maybe miss less. When I tried them on practice, people were killing me. So maybe in the match it's a bit different, everyone is a bit tight so going through the court less. I changed for something that I would make less mistakes [with].”
Medvedev's first Lexus ATP Head2Head defeat to Norrie in five matches drew similarities with his loss to #NextGenATP Learner Tien in the second round at the Australian Open, where he rallied from two sets down before falling in the decider. When asked to compare, Medvedev was quick to point out that bitter defeats are part of the game.
“The career is long, so [with] some matches I won like this, I would [also] not think too much about it,” said Medvedev, who rallied from two sets down to beat Emil Ruusuvuori in five sets in Melbourne in 2024. “But it's [an] unfortunate situation in both matches. Look at the Australian Open in 2024, which was a year and a half ago, which is not long ago, I managed to do it the other way around. It's just tennis.
“This year I lost maybe three matches where I could serve it out. I need to do better next time. Next time I'm there, maybe I [will] do the same thing. Today, unfortunately, [there is] nothing I can do and [I have to] get ready for the next one.”

After his three-hour, 52-minute defeat, Medvedev owns an 18-11 record on the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He has also slipped to 18th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and faces a tall order to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals in November.
Medvedev triumphed at the season finale in 2020, and has made six consecutive appearances at the event. However, the 29-year-old is yet to reach a tour-level final since the 2024 ATP Masters 1000 in Indian Wells and has not lifted a title since Rome in 2023.
Despite his disappointing early exit in Paris, Medvedev has been on the ATP Tour long enough to know that heartbreak and redemption often go hand in hand.
“I probably think it's the same,” Medvedev said when asked about his method of processing defeats. “I lost probably three times here in the first round in five sets. It's always the same story. Maybe one week, two weeks before the next tournament, I'm going to be feeling not good, I'm going to change the surface, so in your game you're not going to feel not good, maybe next tournament is not going to be easy.
“Then you wait, work hard, and wait for the moment where it goes up again. [I'm] disappointed to lose, but I have 10 more tournaments this year or maybe 12, I need to try to play them well.”

Cameron Norrie scored a major upset on Tuesday at Roland Garros, where he sunk 11th seed Daniil Medvedev in a gruelling five-set battle.

The Briton, currently No. 81 in the PIF ATP Rankings, dug deep for a 7-5, 6-3, 4-6, 1-6, 7-5 victory to advance to the second round in Paris for the fifth time. After rallying from a two-sets-to-love deficit, Medvedev then failed to serve out the match at 5-4 in the decider before Norrie crossed the line after three hours, 53 minutes.

“It was an incredible atmosphere, I really felt like I had the momentum there,” Norrie said when asked of the conclusion to the match. “I felt a lot of energy, and I managed to get over the line. He was a little bit tentative, it was honestly a crazy match.

“He's so tough to beat, I think I deserve a diploma for beating Medvedev… He's got me the last four times.”

Norrie pushes through an absolute thriller of a match to defeat Medvedev 7-5 6-3 4-6 1-6 7-5 🔥@rolandgarros | #RolandGarros | #Norrie pic.twitter.com/rlwkcOXnEn

Last week, Norrie rose nine spots in the PIF ATP Rankings with his run to the semi-finals in Geneva, where he lost to eventual champion Novak Djokovic. The former World No. 8 will now look to build on his run of form in Paris, where next faces Argentine lucky loser Federico Agustin Gomez.

Medvedev failed to serve out the opening set at 5-4 and Norrie subsequently won eight consecutive games to soar to a two-sets-to-love lead. The former US Open champion, Medvedev shifted to a more aggressive approach during the second set, but it was unsuccessful, thus reverting back to his more traditional counterpunching style, which proved pivotal.

Leading 2-1 in the third set, Medvedev received a medical timeout to treat a cut on his right index finger. Yet despite the increasingly loose grip on his racquet — and the first-round encounter with Norrie — Medvedev showed signs of resilience. The 29-year-old let slip two break points at 3-2 in the third, according to Infosys Stats, but responded with a mid-match streak of his own, during which he won seven straight games en route to levelling the contest.

However, it was Norrie's fighting spirit that stole the show in the end. The deciding set had traits of a dogfight early on, with Norrie saving four break points to hold serve after a 13-minute opening game. Yet while Medvedev appeared to be closing in on his fifth career comeback from a two-set deficit, Norrie held firm and stuck to his aggressive game plan, reeling off the final four games from 3-5 to seal his first Lexus ATP Head2Head victory over Medvedev in their fifth battle.



Medvedev's first-round defeat draws parallels to his second-round loss at the Australian Open in January, when he rallied from two sets down only to fall to a gut-wrenching five-set defeat to #NextGenATP Learner Tien. Medvedev has now lost in the opening round at Roland Garros in six of his nine appearances in the French capital.

Now 18th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, the former Nitto ATP Finals champion faces a tough task to qualify for the prestigious season finale. He owns an 18-11 record on the season.

Last year's Roland Garros runner-up, Alexander Zverev claimed a contrasting 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 first-round win over Tien on Tuesday. The third seed, who was also defeated by the American in Acapulco in February, saved all four break points faced during the one-hour, 53-minute clash.

The third-seeded Zverev, who has reached the semi-finals in each of his past four appearances at the clay-court major, will next play Francesco Passaro or Jesper de Jong.

“I'm very happy to be back in Paris, Roland Garros is a very special place to me,” said Zverev. “It was a good start to the tournament, very happy with the three set win. Hopefully it's going to continue like this, and hopefully it's going to be a fun two weeks here.”

Zverev has experienced a topsy-turvy season since reaching his third major final in Melbourne in January. The German notably fell to opening-round defeats in Indian Wells and Monte-Carlo before triumphing at the ATP 500 in Munich. After surrendering the World No. 2 spot to Carlos Alcaraz, Zverev will hope to reignite his best form in Paris.

Last year, Zverev ended the Roland Garros career of 14-time champion Rafael Nadal in the first round. The Spaniard was honoured with a permanent plaque on Court Philippe-Chatrier on Sunday.

 Grigor Dimitrov's Roland Garros campaign ended in cruel fashion on Tuesday afternoon, when the 16th-seed was forced to withdraw from his first-round clash against Ethan Quinn due to injury. 

 Dimitrov led qualifier Quinn 6-2, 6-3, 2-6 at the clay-court major before shaking hands with the American. The Bulgarian had taken control of the pair's maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting but received treatment on his left thigh in the second set, and his movement was hindered throughout the third set.

 Now 14-10 for the 2025 season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Dimitrov is No. 19 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. He is at risk of falling out of the Top 20 after Roland Garros, depending on other results. The 2017 Nitto ATP Finals champion has not been outside the Top 20 since July 2023. 
 Roland Garros debutant Quinn, who is competing in Paris at a career-high World No. 106, will take on Alexander Shevchenko in the second round, after the Kazakhstani earlier defeated Dusan Lajovic 6-2, 6-4, 7-6(4). Should the 21-year-old Quinn triumph in that match, he would be well-placed to crack the Top 100 for the first time after Roland Garros.

Coco Gauff broke down in tears during a tense French Open moment at last year's tournament.

Attempting to advance to the 2024 women's finals, Gauff challenged a controversial call while playing No. 1 seed Iga Swiatek.

Swiatek took the first set, 6-2.

Knowing that she needed to rally in the second set, Gauff dug in and played more aggressive.

The No. 3 seed held a 2-1 lead in the second when play abruptly stopped.

""Coco Gauff is not happy,"" an announcer said. ""Neither are the crowd.""

Gauff challenged a call and confronted the chair ump on the court.

""They're booing because they know you are wrong,"" Gauff said. 

She added: ""Are you serious?""

As the crowd booed in the background, Gauff began crying. 

The American star then backed away from the conversation with the umpire and kept crying, before drying her eyes.

""Wow terrible call,"" one fan tweeted. ""Zero excuse when on video. So argumentative and often terrible calls. When is this going to stop?""

Gauff won the game to take a 3-1 lead in the second set and suddenly had the Roland Garros crowd in her corner.

While TV announcers discussed the ""emotional aspect"" of tennis and sports psychologists, Gauff was shown coldly staring straight ahead while sitting down.

But Swiatek battled back to move ahead 5-3 in the second set.

The Polish star finished it off to 6-4 to end Gauff's Roland Garros run.

Gauff quickly walked off the court after the loss.

""She is progressing a lot,"" Swiatek said. ""I'm sure we're going to have plenty more matches at a high level.""

Gauff became highly emotional in 2022 when she almost won the French Open as an 18-year-old.

Wowing Paris fans with her power and precision on the clay courts, Gauff ended up just two sets away from becoming a French Open champion.

""This is the first time for me, so let's try to get through this,"" an emotional Gauff said in the aftermath.

As she spoke, the young American was overwhelmed by the power of the moment.

With fans standing and applauding inside the venue, Gauff paid tribute to Swiatek and joked that she hoped to one day end as a winner when playing the game's No. 1.

""What you've done on tour the past couple months have truly been amazing and you totally deserve it,"" Gauff told Poland's superstar. ""Hopefully we can play each other in more finals.""

As Gauff referenced her supporters, tears began to flow.

Gauff turned her head and wiped her eyes while holding a microphone, then publicly praised all those who helped her reach the finals at 18.

She made amends in the women's doubles final alongside partner Katerina Siniaková, lifting her first Grand Slam tournament doubles trophy after defeating 11th seeds Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini.

Gauff grew up admiring Serena Williams and had a poster of the tennis legend on her wall.

After a tough start to 2025, the world No.2 began her French Open singles campaign on Tuesday against Australian Olivia Gadecki.

She was in scintillating form and reeled off a straightforward 6-2, 6-2 victory.

Coco Gauff jokes about forgetting her rackets before her win against Olivia Gadecki at the French Open. (0:47)

PARIS -- Coco Gauff caused a brief and amusing delay at the French Open on Tuesday when she stepped onto Court Philippe-Chatrier without her rackets.

Gauff looked confused before a ball boy ran out minutes later carrying her pack of rackets.

""That's better,"" said the court announcer, drawing laughter, applause and smiles from the crowd in the tournament's main stadium.

Despite the mix-up, No. 2-seeded Gauff went on to defeat Australia's Olivia Gadecki 6-2, 6-2 in her opening match.

The American jokingly blamed her coach for the missing rackets.

""Honestly, as long as I've been on tour, my coach has always put the rackets in the bag before the match because he's very superstitious,"" she said. ""I'm blaming it on my coach. It's OK.""

Gauff later poked fun at herself on social media, posting an image of a French Open to-do list to X with ""put tennis rackets in bag"" unchecked along with the caption, ""oops, forgot the last one.""

oops, forgot the last one pic.twitter.com/ajqcgFg6mn

Gadecki also found humor in the incident.

""Now that I think about it, it seems like that was the only way I was going to win the match,"" she said about Gauff's empty-handed arrival. ""It was a funny little incident.""

Gauff was a 2022 finalist at Roland-Garros and is among the title contenders again.

Elsewhere in the women's bracket Tuesday, American No. 3 seed Jessica Pegula carved out a comfortable 6-2, 6-4 victory over Romanian Anca Todoni to advance to the second round.

Also, former French Open runner-up Sofia Kenin eased past Frenchwoman Varvara Gracheva 6-3, 6-1 and Russian 6-seed Mirra Andreeva defeated Spain's Cristina Bucsa 6-4, 6-3.

Meanwhile, Polish 25-seed Magdalena Frech defeated Tunisia's former Wimbledon and US Open runner-up Ons Jabeur 7-6 (4), 6-0.

 Another year, another impressive start from Novak Djokovic at Roland Garros. 

 The three-time champion at the clay-court major kick-started his 2025 campaign on Tuesday with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 triumph against Mackenzie McDonald. Djokovic, competing just three days after he lifted his 100th tour-level title at the Gonet Geneva Open, was solid in all facets of his game during a clinical one-hour, 58-minute display inside Court Philippe-Chatrier. 

Straight down to business 🔥@DjokerNole powers past McDonald 6-3 6-3 6-3 to reach R2 at #RolandGarros 💪@rolandgarros pic.twitter.com/EKVQpf2h3d

 With victory in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash against McDonald, Djokovic improved to 20-0 in first-round matches at Roland Garros. The 38-year-old has not lost a set in a Paris opener since he needed four sets to overcome Evgeny Korolev in 2010. 

 “I try to enjoy every moment on this very special and beautiful court,” said Djokovic in French in his on-court interview. “I feel good, clearly, even more here because I'm reliving the memories of last year's Olympics, the last time I played on this court. [They are] beautiful emotions. 

 “It was a solid match. I know that he can play to a better standard than today, but I am very happy with what I produced.”

 Djokovic and McDonald started their match as strong gusts blew across Court Philippe-Chatrier, and the roof was eventually closed early in the second set when rain also began to fall. By that stage, the No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings Djokovic had established a commanding lead after winning six of seven games from 2-2 in the first set. 
 While McDonald battled hard and claimed what would prove to be his only break of Djokovic's serve to reduce his second-set deficit to 3-5, the American was unable to match his opponent's consistent, deep baseline hitting. Djokovic promptly broke in the next game to clinch the second set, and then eased through the third to complete victory having converted five of nine break points he earned, according to Infosys Stats. 

 Djokovic last year reached the quarter-finals at Roland Garros before withdrawing due to a knee injury. He returned to the venue later in the year to claim an Olympic gold medal, and will face Corentin Moutet or qualifier Clement Tabur in the second round at this edition of the clay-court major. 
 “History in this sport has given me everything in my life, it means a lot to me,” said Djokovic, who has won a record 24 Grand Slam men's singles titles. “I always try to make history where I can… In all the tournaments I play, all the practises, all the matches, and especially during the biggest tournaments in the world. There is an opportunity to make more history, and that is one of the biggest motivations I have for competitions, for continuing to work and better myself.”

Former US Open semifinalist Yanina Wickmayer is to retire from tennis following this year's Wimbledon.

On Tuesday, Yanina Wickmayer played the final Roland Garros match of her career, a 6-0, 6-0 loss to Victoria Azarenka. The former World No. 12 and 2009 US Open semifinalist is to retire from professional tennis following this year's Wimbledon.

""I decided to write the last pages of my tennis book in Wimbledon,"" the 35-year-old Belgian wrote on social media last week. ""Being able to close this last chapter on my own terms surrounded by the people who mean the world to me is what I am most grateful for.""

A post shared by Yanina Wickmayer (@yaninawickmayer)

Wickmayer played her first professional tournament in 2004, and surged into the Top 100 in 2008 after notching off a series of milestones across all surfaces in the first half of that season. She made her WTA main-draw debut in Auckland, notched her first two Top 50 wins over sisters Alona and Kateryna Bondarenko in Billie Jean King Cup action, defeated Peng Shuai on home soil in Antwerp for her first tour-level victory, qualified for her first Grand Slam main draw at Roland Garros and reached her first WTA final in Birmingham on grass.

The following year brought even more success for Wickmayer. She defeated Petra Kvitova and Ekaterina Makarova en route to her maiden title in Estoril in May on clay. At the US Open, having just cracked the Top 50 for the first time, Wickmayer put together what would be her best showing on the major stage. As a 19-year-old playing just her seventh Grand Slam main draw, she went all the way to the semifinals, a run that included a first-round upset of No. 16 seed Virginie Razzano and a 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 fourth-round barnburner over Kvitova. After adding a second title in Linz in October -- defeating Kvitova once again in the final -- Wickmayer finished 2009 with the highest year-end ranking of her career at No. 16.

Wickmayer reached her career high of No. 12 in April 2010; she finished the year in the Top 30 for four straight years (2009-12) and in the Top 100 for nine years in a row (2008-16). In that period, she added three more titles (Auckland 2010, Tokyo 2015, Washington 2016) to take her total to five, and reached the fourth round of four further Grand Slams (Australian Open 2010 and 2015, US Open 2010, Wimbledon 2011). Wickmayer notched five Top 10 wins overall, with the best by ranking being an upset of No. 7 Li Na at Dubai 2011.

Following Roland Garros in 2020, Wickmayer took a 16-month maternity leave, giving birth to daughter Luana in April 2021. She returned to action in February 2022, and returned to the Top 100 in July 2023 after winning ITF W100 events in Trnava and Surbiton. That year, she also reached the last four of both Warsaw and Seoul -- her first tour-level semifinals since 2017.

A post shared by Yanina Wickmayer (@yaninawickmayer)

But in 2024, Wickmayer was sidelined by injury for another nine months.

""The fact that I can't be myself on court, practice hard and fight my heart out in matches has been a real struggle for me, because that's my DNA,"" she wrote on social media. ""The reason I started playing again after becoming a mom is because I wanted to end this 'tennis' chapter on my own terms. You can count on me and my perseverance that I will work my ass off to come back and write one last beautiful chapter.""

Wickmayer returned to action in January, and that chapter is now coming to its conclusion following over two decades of a storied career.

Tennis is one of the world's most prestigious sports, rich in tradition and global in reach. It draws millions of viewers—Wimbledon alone attracted over 500 million viewers globally in its most recent edition, and the 2023 US Open broke ESPN's all-time viewership records. The appetite is clearly there. But despite its elite status and loyal fan base, tennis still lags far behind other major sports financially. While the Super Bowl generates $650 million in just four hours, Wimbledon, arguably tennis's crown jewel, struggles to reach even half that amount over two weeks.

The contrast is stark. Leagues like the NFL, NBA, and FIFA have built empires through coordinated media rights, powerful branding, and continuous fan engagement. Tennis, by contrast, remains fractured. Its governing bodies—the ATP, WTA, ITF, and Grand Slams—operate independently, each with its own incentives. This disjointed structure undermines the sport's ability to negotiate major deals, build consistent narratives, and provide financial security to its athletes.

The problem isn't fan interest; it's the inability to monetize it. Tennis has the viewership—Wimbledon alone attracts over 500 million viewers globally—but generates just over $2 billion annually. By comparison, the NFL earns $18 billion from a mostly US-based fan base. The gap isn't in audience size but in how effectively each sport converts attention into revenue.

At the heart of the issue is a tension between tradition and modernity. Tennis prides itself on its individualism and decentralized governance, but that same independence is costing the sport billions. While NBA bench players and NFL rookies sign multimillion-dollar contracts, tennis players must win to get paid. Prize money is performance-based, and lower-ranked players often struggle to cover travel, coaching, and tournament expenses.

Andy Roddick, a former world No. 1, once remarked, “Tennis is the only sport where you can be ranked 80 in the world and still lose money.” That quote remains a sobering reminder of the steep financial climb for those outside the elite—and of how difficult it is to design a system that is both fair and sustainable.

To their credit, the Grand Slams have recognized this disparity in recent years. Wimbledon and the Australian Open have restructured prize distribution to direct more money toward qualifiers and early-round losers. This has helped ease the financial burden for players outside the top 100, many of whom previously left events in the red. However, this solution has created its own moral hazard: now that even a first-round appearance guarantees a substantial payout, some players dealing with injuries or poor form still make the trip—knowing that simply stepping onto the court in Melbourne or London ensures a paycheck. Before these changes, such players might have withdrawn entirely to avoid travel costs they couldn't recoup.

Movements like the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA), co-founded by Novak Djokovic, aim to give players more bargaining power and push for structural reform. But progress has been slow, and the core financial model remains unchanged. The decentralized structure isn't just inefficient—it's resistant to reform. Each governing body has its own legacy, sponsors, and priorities, making unified change incredibly difficult without outside disruption.

Fragmentation has made it nearly impossible for tennis to build cohesive branding or long-term partnerships. Television deals and sponsorships are fragmented and short-lived. The Grand Slam tournaments are shown on different channels or streaming services. Storylines that could keep fans engaged year-round often fizzle out after a Grand Slam final.

That's where rivalries come in. In sports, rivalries are more than emotional spectacles—they're business engines. Magic vs. Bird didn't just lift the NBA's ratings; it sold merchandise, drove ticket sales, and became the foundation for billion-dollar media deals. Messi vs. Ronaldo turned every matchup into a global event. Even Formula 1 has leaned into driver rivalries to fuel fan loyalty and boost subscriptions. Rivalries sell—and smart leagues sell them hard.

Tennis, on the other hand, leaves these opportunities largely untapped. Federer vs. Nadal. Serena vs. Venus. Djokovic vs. Murray. These were cultural moments—but only occasionally. There's no league-wide marketing push, no season-long narrative arc, no structured build-up to marquee matchups. Once each Grand Slam event is over, the storyline disappears. Without coordinated promotional infrastructure, tennis fails to extend its rivalries into broader fan experiences—missing out on sponsorships, media rights, and consistent engagement.

The Formula 1 model offers a compelling alternative. By packaging its sport as a season-long journey with defined races, consistent branding, and media integration—most notably through Netflix's Drive to Survive—F1 has turned drivers into global celebrities and doubled its fan base. Tennis, with its global reach and elite athletes, is perfectly positioned to do the same.

A restructured tennis model could include season-long team formats, optimized revenue sharing, guaranteed salaries, and uniform media production to follow player arcs across the calendar—turning each match into part of a broader storyline. Imagine a reimagined tennis season with league-style tournaments, broadcast packages, and story-driven matchups designed to keep fans invested all year.

Some players might resist such a shift, preferring the independence and variability of today's system. But if a private investor, like those behind LIV Golf, offered a $500 million rival tour with guaranteed pay, streamlined logistics, and global broadcasting, how many would stay loyal to the status quo? LIV Golf has already shown that tradition is no match for money and vision—especially when financial security is on the line.

Tennis, for all its prestige, has left billions on the table. It has a global audience, talent, and tradition. What it lacks is structure—and the willingness to evolve. The question is no longer whether tennis can become a billion-dollar powerhouse. The question is: Who will trigger that change? Will it come from within, or will it take a billionaire disruptor to reimagine what the sport could be?

Either way, the race has already started.

The greatest men's player of all time debate is one that has been roaring for some time, and doesn't look like stopping anytime soon.

And it has now reemerged at the 2025 French Open, which just said goodbye to one of the best players ever in Rafael Nadal.

Nadal was given a fitting farewell on day one at Roland Garros, having won the Grand Slam a record 14 times.

He was joined on court Philippe Chatrier by several other legends, including Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray.

Nadal thanked Djokovic, Federer and Murray for being a part of his farewell ceremony, during which he was left very emotional.

Unsurprisingly, the Big Three have now featured in Tim Henman's list of the top 5 best male players of all time.

Sharing his list with TNT Sports, former British number one Henman commented: “Fifth place is Rod Laver.

“I think for someone to win the career… the calendar Grand Slam on two occasions, just absolutely phenomenal. He's a real icon, ambassador of our sport, so he is my fifth.

“In fourth place I would say Pete Sampras. He was someone that I played against many, many times. Seven Wimbledon titles, 14 Grand Slams in total, an incredible career.

“In third place I would go for Roger Federer. Winner of 20 Grand Slam titles, eight Wimbledons, played so well on every surface, just how easy he made the game look with his footwork, but also his technique. That one-handed backhand was always a pleasure to watch.

“In second place I would go Rafa Nadal. He won 22 Grand Slams, 14 French Opens. We often talk about records are there to be broken, but I'm convinced that 14 singles titles at Roland Garros will never be broken.

“Greatest male player of all time is Novak Djokovic. What he's done, winning every Grand Slam a minimum three times. He's won 24 majors, going for his 25th here in Roland Garros. He's the best player that I've ever seen.”

Henman unfortunately never got over the line in terms of Grand Slam success, with his world-class rivals undoubtedly playing a key role in that.

The Briton reached the semi-finals of three of the four tournaments, with only the fourth round of the Australian Open reached.

But he was constantly competing against some of the greatest players that the game has ever seen, the like of which it may never see again.

Only Djokovic remains from Henman's best-ever players, with the Serbian currently chasing a record 25th Grand Slam title.

He remains a real threat on the ATP Tour, but young stars Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have been making it hard for him and indeed anyone else to impress.

Iga Swiatek is searching for a fourth consecutive French Open title at this year's event.

The Polish star hasn't had the best of starts to her 2025 campaign, and traveled to Paris having failed to win any of the eight WTA tournaments she's played.

Despite her recent struggles, many are still picking Swiatek to come away with the French Open title, thanks to her dominance on the Parisian clay over the years.

Swiatek beat Rebecca Sramkova in her opener, 6-3, 6-3, to send her through to the second round in convincing fashion.

After the match, Swiatek revealed what she finds different about the French Open compared to the next Grand Slam event, Wimbledon.

During her post-match press conference, Swiatek gave her verdict on the French Open and Wimbledon.

“I just love everything here because of the fact that I have played good here,” she said.

“When I compare it to Wimbledon, for example, at Wimbledon I always feel this tension that I am not sure what is going to happen, but here at Roland Garros it feels like home.

“I just hope that I am going to play well enough to stay here as long as possible.”

Swiatek then assessed her level, having beaten her Slovakian opponent in straight sets.

“Honestly, from the beginning I was ready to compete and I was just happy that I was there on Philippe Chatrier,” she said.

“Rebecca [Sramkova] played much better than in Australia, so for sure she worked on some stuff and changed some stuff.

“But I was happy with my game. I was really focused on what I wanted to do on the court, and my head was clear, so when I made some mistakes, I corrected them immediately, and it was a good day.”

Swiatek had beaten Sramkova, 6-0, 6-2, at the Australian Open in January, but was made to work harder in Paris.

Just as she did in Melbourne, Swiatek will return to take on Emma Raducanu after beating Sramkova.

Swiatek leads the head-to-head with Raducanu, 4-0, and is yet to drop a set against the British star.

Only time will tell who will come out on top in their fifth career meeting when Swiatek and Raducanu battle it out for a place in the third round on Wednesday, May 28.

Swiatek mentioned how she feels ‘tension' when playing at Wimbledon, but how has she fared on the grass during her career to date?

The world number five came closest to victory in 2023, when she lost to Ukraine's Elina Svitolina in the quarterfinals.

Her results at Roland Garros are far more impressive, winning the tournament on four of her six visits to the French capital.

It's perhaps no surprise that the French Open has been Swiatek's most successful Grand Slam event, as she continues to produce her best tennis on the clay.

It remains to be seen if Swiatek can improve upon her underwhelming Wimbledon record when the tournament begins on Monday, June 30.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Fresh from reaching a career-high world No. 8 ranking, British tennis stalwart Cameron Norrie remains a prominent figure in the sport.

This distinguished left-hander has etched a significant path on the ATP Tour, highlighted by a maiden Masters 1000 triumph at Indian Wells and a Wimbledon semi-final appearance.

While his ranking has seen recent shifts, Norrie's journey reflects his resilience as he continues to compete on the Grand Slam stage.

Tennis Head has everything you need to know about this accomplished player.

Norrie's partner is Louise Jacobi. She is an American who works as a textile designer and has her own homeware and fashion accessory shop called Studio Virgo. 

They reportedly met in 2019 in New York City and have been together for about four years.

Cameron Norrie and Louise Jacobi have been together for around four years. The couple were introduced by mutual friends at a New York City bar in 2019.

Norrie's ranking has seen a substantial shift. After reaching a career-high of No. 8 in the ATP singles ranking in September 2022, he has since moved down the rankings to his current position of No. 81 as of May 19, 2025.

His rise to the top 10 was a result of consistent performances, including his first ATP title win in Los Cabos in 2021, followed by a victory at the Indian Wells Masters later that year. 

However, maintaining such a high ranking in the competitive world of professional tennis is a constant challenge. While Norrie remains a formidable player, recent results have not consistently matched his peak level from 2021 and 2022, leading to the current drop in his ranking. 

Australian Open: Norrie's best showing in Melbourne was reaching the fourth round in 2024. Across his appearances, he holds a 7-7 win-loss record at the Australian Open. In the 2025 edition, he was beaten in the first round by Matteo Berrettini. His performance in the earlier rounds has varied, but the 2024 run marked his deepest journey in this Grand Slam.

French Open: Roland Garros has seen Norrie reach the third round on three occasions: in 2021, 2022, and 2023. His overall record at the French Open is balanced at 7 wins and 7 losses. He is currently participating in the 2025 tournament.

Wimbledon: His most successful Grand Slam tournament is Wimbledon, where he achieved his best major result by reaching the semi-final in 2022. His career record at the All England Club stands at 11 wins and 7 losses. In the 2024 edition, he reached the third round before losing to Alexander Zverev.

US Open: At Flushing Meadows, Norrie's best performance was reaching the fourth round in 2022. His overall win-loss record at the US Open is 9 wins and 7 losses, although he did not take part in 2024. His appearances have shown constant progress to the middle stages of the event.

Norrie was born in 1995 in Johannesburg, South Africa, to British microbiologist parents: his father, David, is from Glasgow and his mother, Helen, is from Cardiff.

In 1998, when Norrie was three, he and his family moved to Auckland, New Zealand, after being victims of a burglary in South Africa. His parents lived in New Zealand until 2023 when they moved back to the United Kingdom.

In 2011, at age 16, he moved to his parents' native United Kingdom, where he lived in London for three years before attending Texas Christian University in Fort Worth from 2014 to 2017. 

In June 2017, he ended his studies at TCU to turn professional during the grass court season of the 2017 ATP Tour.

Norrie is 29 years old and was born on August 23, 1995. He is 6 feet 2 inches tall. He began playing tennis at the age of six, with his mother introducing him to the sport, and he supposedly started playing in the driveway of their family home in New Zealand.

Norrie's estimated net worth is around £4.43 million as of July 2024, mainly built through his tennis career. His total prize money earnings exceed £8.75 million (as of January 2025). Beyond on-court earnings, lucrative endorsements greatly contribute to his wealth.

He has partnered with the likes of Babolat, Rado, Maui Jim and Lexus UK. Other endorsements include Ralph Lauren, Uber, Athletic Brewing, Waterdrop, PGIM, and Illuvium.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

A titanic terre battue tug-of-war turned when Cameron Norrie pulled a pulsating escape act.

Then Norrie hurled.

An ecstatic Norrie wound up and flung his Babolat high in the sky.



Winless in four career clashes vs. Daniil Medvedev, Norrie pulled off a crackling 7-5, 6-3, 4-6, 1-6, 7-5 upset of the former Roland Garros quarterfinalist on Court Simonne Mathieu.

On match point, Norrie ran down an angled dropper, slid a reply down the line and set up at net. A sprinting Medvedev had a look at a tough running forehand pass but sailed the shot long inciting Norrie to try to pierce the clouds with that racquet throw.

The world No. 81 called it “one of the top three” victories of his life.

“It was just nice release of energy. I think it was a good throw,” Norrie told the media in Paris. “I threw it pretty well, pretty accurate. Yeah, I was happy it stayed on the court. Racquet wasn't broken.

“Yeah, it was just kind of instinct. Threw it. Yeah, it was, like I said, playing Daniil is not easy. I've lost to him I think the last four, maybe five times at least. It was always going to be a tricky match for me. I was really happy with how I handled the match and how I had to fight literally every point to have a chance with him. It was just pure emotion at the end and pure instinct. It was a good throw.”

The victor's elation contrasted with the loser's deflation.

Playing as a non Top 10 seed for the first time in a Slam since the 2019 Wimbledon, Medvedev suffered his sixth Roland Garros opening-round exit in nine Paris appearances.

Four months after Medvedev lost to Learner Tien in a painful five-set Australian Open second-round loss, he faces the ghosts of frustration—and a title drought that dates back to his unlikely run to the 2023 Rome championship. Medvedev fell to Jannik Sinner in a punishing five-set Australian Open final loss in 2024 and went on to reach the Wimbledon semifinals and US Open quarterfinals last year.

This loss stings because Medvedev served for the second round at 5-4 and delivered a sloppy game.

“I didn't manage to serve it out. I mean, kind of close match,” Medvedev said. “Great fight. Disappointed to lose. He played well. I didn't play good enough. So that's why I lost.”

Norrie threw everything he had at Medvedev, who clawed back from a two-set hole making a radical racquet change. Medvedev switched to an all polyester string bed and tighter tension in his Tecnifibre racquet. The string switch worked: Medvedev rallied from two sets down and served for the second round at 5-4 only to see Norrie drain a slew of unforced errors breaking back at 15.

The final two games were deuce duels that saw Norrie lock down and beat Medvedev at his own game of baseline counterstrikes.

“This one is so different from Rome and Madrid. Clay, the balls, like, everything,” Medvedev said of the string switch. “I had one week here. I didn't find anything that worked well.

“So during the match, I had to change something when I was losing. It actually worked. Unfortunately I didn't win.”

The left-handed Norrie snapped an eight-match losing streak against Top 20 opponents on clay posting his first Top 20 triumph on dirt since defeating No. 2 Carlos Acaraz in the 2023 Rio final.

Though Norrie was 0-10 vs. Top 20 players since defeating No. 11 Casper Ruud at the 2024 Australian Open, he had a secret weapon working today: Imagination.

Norrie, who played through qualifying to battle to the Geneva semifinals last week where he pushed Grand Slam king Novak Djokovic to three sets, said he felt he was riding the red clay wave.

“I think it was really helpful to play Novak last week in the semis,” Norrie said. “I felt it was just a continuation of that match today. It was like playing the fourth set against Novak in the first set against Daniil. I really felt prepared.

“I had the matches, like I said. It was maybe tougher today than it was with Novak in terms of the rallies. He would give me absolutely nothing. It was a lot of fun. Like I said, I prepared well. Yeah, managed to go my way. You can take the confidence from last week, qualifying and playing four, five really.”

After breaking Medvedev twice in a row to seize a gritty three hour, 53 minute win, Norrie did not break his Babolat stick with the victory hurl. He'll need it for round two against 144th-ranked Argentinean lucky loser Federico Gomez.

Relishing these big battles is helping spark Norrie's revival at the age of 29.

“I think it just comes back to how much I've been enjoying it,” Norrie said. “Last week and the weeks before that, the whole clay season, I'm just really enjoying all of it on the court, off the court.

“Not trying to put any expectation on the match day or the performances. Just playing with what I got that day and making it tough for the other guy, enjoying all the moments. I did that again today. I could have lost the match. But somehow it went my way.”

Aussie Jordan Thompson has revealed Nick Kyrgios is 'pretty down' after another knee injury forced him to withdraw from the French Open, while Naomi Osaka broke down in tears during her press conference after a first-round loss. Kyrgios surprised the tennis community having announced he was building his match fitness in order to play doubles at Roland Garros with Thompson.

Clay has never been Kygrios' favourite surface and in the past he has opted to skip a number of the major events to save his body for the grass court season. However, Kyrgios appeared keen to link-up with his fellow Aussie in just his fourth tournament of 2025.

Unfortunately, Thompson revealed Kyrgios injured himself while training in Australia. And in a sad revelation Thompson claimed Kyrgios was finding it harder and harder to return from each injury.

""Nick was really pumped to play here. He kept messaging me every week, 'you good to go to for doubs at Roland Garros',"" Thompson said. ""I know he was back home in Australia training on clay, but a few days ago, Nick told me that he's done something to his knee, so unfortunately, he just couldn't be here.

""He was pretty down. He told me he doesn't know how much more of these injuries he can take, and you've just got to feel for him. Because as much as he says things in the media, I think he loves playing tennis and he loves being on court, so it's disappointing that he can't be here on the court.""

Thompson will now partner fellow Aussie Jason Kubler for a first-round match on Tuesday against French pair Quentin Halys and Albano Olivetti. After dealing with a number of wrist and knee injuries that ruled him out for around 18 months, Kyrgios made his comeback at the Australian Open where he went down in the first round.

Unfortunately, Kyrgios has only played four singles matches in 2025 having won his only match in Miami earlier this year. While he isn't able to compete in Paris it remains to be seen if he will make a push to play at Wimbledon. Last year, Kyrgios turned his attention to commentary having been ruled out for SW19.

Unfortunately for Osaka, she was left frustrated after Paula Badosa came from behind to clinch a three-set victory in their first round encounter. Osaka won the first set, but wasn't able to lift her game when Badosa rallied with the Spaniard prevailing 6-7 6-1 6-4 in an exciting clash.

However, Osaka was hard on herself after the loss and broke down in tears when talking about her trainer and the people she felt she had let down. “I hate disappointing people. Even with Patrick I was thinking just now that he goes from working with like the greatest player ever to like… what the f**k this is,"" she said fighting back tears.

Osaka entered the French Open as the World No.49, but received a brutal first round opponent in Badosa. Traditionally, she has never had much success on clay having reached the third round at the event three times, but never advancing beyond that.

While Osaka struggled in 2024 having not gone past the second round of any grand slam, she did one better at the Australian Open this year having reached the third. And she will be looking to do even better at Wimbledon with plenty of fans rallying around the tennis star after her latest setback.

While Kyrgios won't be taking part in the tournament, he will feature as a commentator in Paris. Kyrgios hasn't competed at Roland Garros since 2017 having reached the second round. And while he won't get another chance to better that record in 2025, he will be on the sideline offering his analysis.

Kyrgios is increasingly turning his attention to media opportunities in recent years having made an appearance as a commentator at Wimbledon last year. The Aussie's guest appearances were met with plenty of praise. And after Thompson's latest comments about Krygios' setback, it appears a media career could be a future path for the 30-year-old.

Unfortunately for Thompson and the Aussie contingent it was not a great opening day on clay in Paris. Aleksandar Vukic, Chris O'Connell, Daria Saville, Kim Birrell and a battered Thompson all went down in the opening round.

But Alexei Popyrin managed to reach the second round of Roland Garros having broken his drought of first round exits. While Daria Kasatkina celebrated her first grand slam win playing under the Australian flag after making the switch.

Nine's Wide World of Sports

French tennis boss Gilles Moretton defended the passionate local fans at Roland-Garros, comparing their parochial behaviour to the crowds seen at the Australian Open.

Crowd behaviour at Roland-Garros this year has come into focus after Iga Swiatek and David Goffin expressed displeasure over treatment from fans in 2024, with Goffin declaring the atmosphere ""is becoming like football.""

Moretton also defended French officials against complaints men's matches were being played in the prime-time spot at night in Paris ahead of the women's games which have been played in the morning.

Yet when it came to the fans and whether they're more boisterous than those seen at other tournaments, Moretton shut down the claim.

""You're talking about the French players playing? It was the same in Australia. I was in Australia,"" the French Tennis Federation chief said.

""We have some people, they love tennis, and they know tennis very well. They know when to stop. They are not doing anything. That's the way French people are. I'm sorry. They support their players.

""Maybe they make too much noise. We feel like that atmosphere is good for tennis. If it goes too far, we will have to say something. I hope it not bother too much the players. That's the way it is.""

Australian Adam Walton, who plays German Maximillian Marterer in an opening round match on Tuesday night, agreed with Moretton, staying he copped it from the crowd when he played Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech last year.

He said it's normal for the home crowd to barrack for the local player and show a level of disdain for the opponent.

""When I played the Australian Open, it was all for me and then obviously here, it was all against me,"" he said.

Regarding men's matches taking precedence over women in the prime time night slot, Moretton said tournament boss and former world No.1 Amelie Mauresmo had a duty to schedule the match of the day at night.

The issue of scheduling comes up every year at every grand slam and it's no different at Roland-Garros this year, when Swiatek posted her 22nd straight win at Roland Garros in front of a half-empty crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday morning (local time).

""My position didn't change. I like playing days, so I'm happy that I'm done and I can have a longer rest,"" Swiatek said.

""But on the other hand, people just try to look for, like, not even things between men and women. You can find that in the schedule a little bit, and you can ask us all the time, but honestly, my answers are not going to change, so I don't mind.""

In the opening days, world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka played in the day while former Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin played the midday match on the main court on Tuesday.

The men have held all the night slots so far, with American Ben Shelton and world No.1 Jannik Sinner playing the two prime time slots.

French veteran Gael Monfils has the night match on Tuesday (Wednesday morning AEST).

Cameron Norrie scored a major upset on Tuesday at Roland Garros, where he sunk 11th seed Daniil Medvedev in a gruelling five-set battle.

The Briton, currently No. 81 in the PIF ATP Rankings, dug deep for a 7-5, 6-3, 4-6, 1-6, 7-5 victory to advance to the second round in Paris for the fifth time. After rallying from a two-sets-to-love deficit, Medvedev then failed to serve out the match at 5-4 in the decider before Norrie crossed the line after three hours, 53 minutes.

“It was an incredible atmosphere, I really felt like I had the momentum there,” Norrie said when asked of the conclusion to the match. “I felt a lot of energy, and I managed to get over the line. He was a little bit tentative, it was honestly a crazy match.

“He's so tough to beat, I think I deserve a diploma for beating Medvedev… He's got me the last four times.”

Last week, Norrie rose nine spots in the PIF ATP Rankings with his run to the semi-finals in Geneva, where he lost to eventual champion Novak Djokovic. The former World No. 8 will now look to build on his run of form in Paris, where next faces Argentine lucky loser Federico Agustin Gomez.

Medvedev failed to serve out the opening set at 5-4 and Norrie subsequently won eight consecutive games to soar to a two-sets-to-love lead. The former US Open champion, Medvedev shifted to a more aggressive approach during the second set, but it was unsuccessful, thus reverting back to his more traditional counterpunching style, which proved pivotal.

Leading 2-1 in the third set, Medvedev received a medical timeout to treat a cut on his right index finger. Yet despite the increasingly loose grip on his racquet — and the first-round encounter with Norrie — Medvedev showed signs of resilience. The 29-year-old let slip two break points at 3-2 in the third, according to Infosys Stats, but responded with a mid-match streak of his own, during which he won seven straight games en route to levelling the contest.

However, it was Norrie's fighting spirit that stole the show in the end. The deciding set had traits of a dogfight early on, with Norrie saving four break points to hold serve after a 13-minute opening game. Yet while Medvedev appeared to be closing in on his fifth career comeback from a two-set deficit, Norrie held firm and stuck to his aggressive game plan, reeling off the final four games from 3-5 to seal his first Lexus ATP Head2Head victory over Medvedev in their fifth battle.



Medvedev's first-round defeat draws parallels to his second-round loss at the Australian Open in January, when he rallied from two sets down only to fall to a gut-wrenching five-set defeat to #NextGenATP Learner Tien. Medvedev has now lost in the opening round at Roland Garros in six of his nine appearances in the French capital.

Now 18th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, the former Nitto ATP Finals champion faces a tough task to qualify for the prestigious season finale. He owns an 18-11 record on the season.

Last year's Roland Garros runner-up, Alexander Zverev claimed a contrasting 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 first-round win over Tien on Tuesday. The third seed, who was also defeated by the American in Acapulco in February, saved all four break points faced during the one-hour, 53-minute clash.

The third-seeded Zverev, who has reached the semi-finals in each of his past four appearances at the clay-court major, will next play Francesco Passaro or Jesper de Jong.

“I'm very happy to be back in Paris, Roland Garros is a very special place to me,” said Zverev. “It was a good start to the tournament, very happy with the three set win. Hopefully it's going to continue like this, and hopefully it's going to be a fun two weeks here.”

Zverev has experienced a topsy-turvy season since reaching his third major final in Melbourne in January. The German notably fell to opening-round defeats in Indian Wells and Monte-Carlo before triumphing at the ATP 500 in Munich. After surrendering the World No. 2 spot to Carlos Alcaraz, Zverev will hope to reignite his best form in Paris.

Last year, Zverev ended the Roland Garros career of 14-time champion Rafael Nadal in the first round. The Spaniard was honoured with a permanent plaque on Court Philippe-Chatrier on Sunday.

 Another year, another impressive start from Novak Djokovic at Roland Garros. 

 The three-time champion at the clay-court major kick-started his 2025 campaign on Tuesday with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 triumph against Mackenzie McDonald. Djokovic, competing just three days after he lifted his 100th tour-level title at the Gonet Geneva Open, was solid in all facets of his game during a clinical one-hour, 58-minute display inside Court Philippe-Chatrier. 

Straight down to business 🔥@DjokerNole powers past McDonald 6-3 6-3 6-3 to reach R2 at #RolandGarros 💪@rolandgarros pic.twitter.com/EKVQpf2h3d

 With victory in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash against McDonald, Djokovic improved to 20-0 in first-round matches at Roland Garros. The 38-year-old has not lost a set in a Paris opener since he needed four sets to overcome Evgeny Korolev in 2010. 

 “I try to enjoy every moment on this very special and beautiful court,” said Djokovic in French in his on-court interview. “I feel good, clearly, even more here because I'm reliving the memories of last year's Olympics, the last time I played on this court. [They are] beautiful emotions. 

 “It was a solid match. I know that he can play to a better standard than today, but I am very happy with what I produced.”

 Djokovic and McDonald started their match as strong gusts blew across Court Philippe-Chatrier, and the roof was eventually closed early in the second set when rain also began to fall. By that stage, the No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings Djokovic had established a commanding lead after winning six of seven games from 2-2 in the first set. 
 While McDonald battled hard and claimed what would prove to be his only break of Djokovic's serve to reduce his second-set deficit to 3-5, the American was unable to match his opponent's consistent, deep baseline hitting. Djokovic promptly broke in the next game to clinch the second set, and then eased through the third to complete victory having converted five of nine break points he earned, according to Infosys Stats. 

 Djokovic last year reached the quarter-finals at Roland Garros before withdrawing due to a knee injury. He returned to the venue later in the year to claim an Olympic gold medal, and will face Corentin Moutet or qualifier Clement Tabur in the second round at this edition of the clay-court major. 
 “History in this sport has given me everything in my life, it means a lot to me,” said Djokovic, who has won a record 24 Grand Slam men's singles titles. “I always try to make history where I can… In all the tournaments I play, all the practises, all the matches, and especially during the biggest tournaments in the world. There is an opportunity to make more history, and that is one of the biggest motivations I have for competitions, for continuing to work and better myself.”

 Grigor Dimitrov's Roland Garros campaign ended in cruel fashion on Tuesday afternoon, when the 16th-seed was forced to withdraw from his first-round clash against Ethan Quinn due to injury. 

 Dimitrov led qualifier Quinn 6-2, 6-3, 2-6 at the clay-court major before shaking hands with the American. The Bulgarian had taken control of the pair's maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting but received treatment on his left thigh in the second set, and his movement was hindered throughout the third set.

 Now 14-10 for the 2025 season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Dimitrov is No. 19 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. He is at risk of falling out of the Top 20 after Roland Garros, depending on other results. The 2017 Nitto ATP Finals champion has not been outside the Top 20 since July 2023. 
 Roland Garros debutant Quinn, who is competing in Paris at a career-high World No. 106, will take on Alexander Shevchenko in the second round, after the Kazakhstani earlier defeated Dusan Lajovic 6-2, 6-4, 7-6(4). Should the 21-year-old Quinn triumph in that match, he would be well-placed to crack the Top 100 for the first time after Roland Garros.

Former US Open semifinalist Yanina Wickmayer is to retire from tennis following this year's Wimbledon.

On Tuesday, Yanina Wickmayer played the final Roland Garros match of her career, a 6-0, 6-0 loss to Victoria Azarenka. The former World No. 12 and 2009 US Open semifinalist is to retire from professional tennis following this year's Wimbledon.

""I decided to write the last pages of my tennis book in Wimbledon,"" the 35-year-old Belgian wrote on social media last week. ""Being able to close this last chapter on my own terms surrounded by the people who mean the world to me is what I am most grateful for.""

A post shared by Yanina Wickmayer (@yaninawickmayer)

Wickmayer played her first professional tournament in 2004, and surged into the Top 100 in 2008 after notching off a series of milestones across all surfaces in the first half of that season. She made her WTA main-draw debut in Auckland, notched her first two Top 50 wins over sisters Alona and Kateryna Bondarenko in Billie Jean King Cup action, defeated Peng Shuai on home soil in Antwerp for her first tour-level victory, qualified for her first Grand Slam main draw at Roland Garros and reached her first WTA final in Birmingham on grass.

The following year brought even more success for Wickmayer. She defeated Petra Kvitova and Ekaterina Makarova en route to her maiden title in Estoril in May on clay. At the US Open, having just cracked the Top 50 for the first time, Wickmayer put together what would be her best showing on the major stage. As a 19-year-old playing just her seventh Grand Slam main draw, she went all the way to the semifinals, a run that included a first-round upset of No. 16 seed Virginie Razzano and a 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 fourth-round barnburner over Kvitova. After adding a second title in Linz in October -- defeating Kvitova once again in the final -- Wickmayer finished 2009 with the highest year-end ranking of her career at No. 16.

Wickmayer reached her career high of No. 12 in April 2010; she finished the year in the Top 30 for four straight years (2009-12) and in the Top 100 for nine years in a row (2008-16). In that period, she added three more titles (Auckland 2010, Tokyo 2015, Washington 2016) to take her total to five, and reached the fourth round of four further Grand Slams (Australian Open 2010 and 2015, US Open 2010, Wimbledon 2011). Wickmayer notched five Top 10 wins overall, with the best by ranking being an upset of No. 7 Li Na at Dubai 2011.

Following Roland Garros in 2020, Wickmayer took a 16-month maternity leave, giving birth to daughter Luana in April 2021. She returned to action in February 2022, and returned to the Top 100 in July 2023 after winning ITF W100 events in Trnava and Surbiton. That year, she also reached the last four of both Warsaw and Seoul -- her first tour-level semifinals since 2017.

A post shared by Yanina Wickmayer (@yaninawickmayer)

But in 2024, Wickmayer was sidelined by injury for another nine months.

""The fact that I can't be myself on court, practice hard and fight my heart out in matches has been a real struggle for me, because that's my DNA,"" she wrote on social media. ""The reason I started playing again after becoming a mom is because I wanted to end this 'tennis' chapter on my own terms. You can count on me and my perseverance that I will work my ass off to come back and write one last beautiful chapter.""

Wickmayer returned to action in January, and that chapter is now coming to its conclusion following over two decades of a storied career.

When a match feels like a toss-up, why not look to the total?ByZachary CohenPublished May 27, 2025 copy_link

Hubert Hurkacz is fresh off a run to the final in Geneva, where he put up a strong effort in a three-set loss to Novak Djokovic. However, despite the fact that Hurkacz is the higher-ranked and more accomplished player, there's a lot of support for Joao Fonseca in the market. That shouldn't be too surprising considering the Brazilian's immense talent, recent ascent and overall popularity. And it's certainly not crazy to think the 18-year-old will find a way to win this one.But there's nobody forcing you to take a side in this match, and it certainly feels like one that should be server-friendly. So, why not take the Over on the game total?You can get the Over on a 38.5-game total at -135 odds, and that feels really low for a match that should go at least four sets. Even the most optimistic Fonseca bettors have to be expecting Hurkacz, one of the best servers on the planet, to serve his way to a tiebreaker win at some point. Hurkacz hasn't quite been himself over the last 52 weeks, as he has battled injuries and struggled to find his top-10 form. But he is still near the top of the ATP leaderboard in hold percentage (88.2%) in that span. And for as good as Fonseca is, he has rarely seen a serve this good. It could take him some time to get a read on it, if he does so at all.On the other side of things, Fonseca has a booming serve and Hurkacz has a break percentage of just 15.5% over the last 52 weeks. The Brazilian should be able to work his way deep into sets regularly, too.Hurkacz has gone Over a total of 38.5 games in six of his last seven matches in Paris, and I don't see that streak ending in what should be a tightly-contested battle with one of the sport's up-and-coming stars. While a ton of people are high on Fonseca's chances of winning here, the only reason I see this going Under is if the Brazilian can't put his recent struggles behind him to perform at a high level, on a big stage. But I don't see that happening. I think both of these guys show up, providing us with an early-round banger.Pick: Over 38.5 Games (-135)

PARIS, France — Riding high after capturing the biggest title of his career—his first ATP Masters 1000 in Madrid—an in-form Casper Ruud arrived in Paris with momentum, but also with something to prove after managing only one game in a Rome quarterfinal rout to Jannik Sinner.On Monday, the two-time Roland Garros finalist got off to a confident start, easing past Albert Ramos-Vinolas 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 to extend his perfect first-round record in Paris to 8-0.But while his tennis may be under control, managing his “clean and strict” diet on the road?

Staying consistent with nutrition goals is no small feat on the pro tennis circuit. Temptation is always around the corner as they regularly compete in foodie havens—just try resisting the local cuisine in Rome, Paris, New York or Hong Kong. Add in varying food safety standards, and even the most disciplined players can struggle to stick to their plans.While a private chef might solve the problem, that luxury is reserved for the tour's top earners. Novak Djokovic, for instance, often travels with a chef to help manage his plant-based, gluten-free diet and intermittent fasting regimen.Read More: Novak Djokovic shares his diet regimen on Tennis United“That's an investment that I've thought about in the past, but it's practically quite hard because you would need a place with a kitchen, to have fresh food all the time. It's not easy at all,” Ruud explained.“Hotels are more practical for us because if you lose, you can just check out and leave. If you're renting a private place, you need to rent it for the whole stay in case you make the final or win the tournament.“It's a pretty big commitment financially to do that. I haven't found the budget for it and the need for it.”

Fernando Alonso's ongoing mission to score points in 2025 was fruitless once again at the Monaco Grand Prix as he was forced to retire with a power unit issue, taking his tally of DNFs to three for the season.

For the first time since 2001, the former World Champion has failed to score in the first eight races – Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto, Alpine's Franco Colapinto and the replaced Jack Doohan the only other drivers on zero points.

A crash in the Australian season opener, a brake issue in China, and a car that has generally lacked performance have all contributed to Alonso's frustrating start to the year, while his team mate Lance Stroll has accumulated 14 points.

It seemed as though there had been a positive change of fortune for the Spaniard in Monaco as he put together a lap good enough for P7 in Qualifying, which became P6 after Lewis Hamilton was handed a three-place grid penalty.

Aston Martin have struggled with pace and reliability this season

However, his hopes of holding onto the position vanished when his Aston Martin began to smoke and he parked up at Rascasse, which was the culmination of an earlier problem that initially appeared to be manageable.

“I think the race was difficult from our side,” Alonso concluded. “We had to manage many things – from Lap 15 we had a problem so we didn't have the electrical part of the engine. It was 160hp [horsepower] less.

“Here in Monaco it's not crucial, the power, so we kept sixth position alive for quite a long time, but in the end the engine stopped. It was not the end of the weekend that we wanted.

“It is not down to luck. It's not that the wrong Safety Car or something came from the sky and hit our car – today [there] was something wrong on our engine that we need to investigate and try to improve for next time.

“I'm competitive – it's not that I feel slow or I just have contact with the wall or with people on the first lap and because of my mistakes, I'm not scoring any points. I think I'm driving at a high level and I just need to wait and see what happens in the next races.”

2025 Monaco GP FP1: Leclerc runs into the back of Stroll's Aston Martin in first practice

It was the second consecutive race in which the Silverstone-based team have left without points, as Stroll was unable to make any major improvements after a troubled start to the weekend.

He received a one-place grid penalty for a collision with Charles Leclerc in FP1, and was later hit with a further three-place drop for impeding Pierre Gasly during Qualifying. This left him in 19th place on the grid, which turned into 15th by the time the chequered flag fell.

Stroll – who at least managed a fine last-lap overtake on Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg, which you can watch below – said: “It's Monaco – when you have a tough Saturday, Sunday's always a challenge. It was always going to be tricky from the back today.

“Red flags, traffic, all that stuff yesterday were just unfortunate circumstances that really made for the impossible today. Just turn the page and look forward to Barcelona.”

Williams have confirmed that Victor Martins will participate in an F1 race weekend for the first time at the upcoming Spanish Grand Prix by getting behind the wheel of the FW47 during Free Practice 1.

Martins – who joined the Williams Driver Academy in March – is currently competing in his third Formula 2 season, during which he has so far scored a podium for ART Grand Prix in the Saudi Arabia Feature Race as well as taking pole position in Melbourne.

The Frenchman previously won a closely-fought title fight in the 2022 Formula 3 campaign, beating drivers including Isack Hadjar and Ollie Bearman to take the crown at the Monza season finale.

Following his progression to F2, Martins helped the ART Grand Prix to secure their first F2 Teams' title in 2023 and went on to claim five podiums in 2024, which included a victory in Barcelona.

Martins is currently competing in his third Formula 2 season with ART Grand Prix

In preparation for his FP1 debut, Martins took part in the TPC (Testing of Previous Cars) programme in Monza earlier this year where he drove the FW45 alongside fellow Williams Racing Academy driver Luke Browning.

“I'm super happy to be taking the wheel of the FW47 for the first time in Barcelona!” said Martins. “It will be an incredible experience to drive for the team. I'm working hard to prepare as much as possible to maximise my time in the car and make it a valuable session for myself and the team.

Sven Smeets, Sporting Director at Williams, added: “We're proud that Victor will be taking part in his first Formula 1 session with Atlassian Williams Racing in Barcelona. He continues to demonstrate that he is a talented driver, and this session is an important step forward in his career as part of the Academy.

“His participation in our TPC programme and simulator work in Grove have prepared him well and we look forward to seeing him in the garage this weekend.”

Christian Horner has admitted that Red Bull “rolled the dice” with an offset strategy for Max Verstappen during the Monaco Grand Prix, with the team extending the Dutchman's final stint before making a compulsory second stop on the penultimate lap amid the “jeopardy” posed by the new regulation.

After lining up in fourth place on the grid – having been promoted one spot owing to Lewis Hamilton's three-place penalty – Verstappen ran a long opening stint on the hard tyre before bolting on the medium compound.

And while others were making a second visit to the pits – as part of a regulation change that required every driver to make two pit stops during the race in Monte Carlo – the World Champion remained out on track for as long as possible, meaning that he led the race for much of the latter stages before finally heading to the pits on the penultimate lap of the event.

This saw Verstappen cross the line in fourth – with McLaren's Lando Norris taking victory ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and the other papaya car of Oscar Piastri – and Horner believes that the plan was the best call should there have been any incidents during the closing stages of the Grand Prix.

Verstappen took fourth place in Monaco, having spent much of the latter stages of the race in the lead owing to his offset strategy

“We rolled the dice a little bit today,” Horner explained after the race. “Starting on the hard [tyre] our tactic was always to go long, with the main opportunity being Safety Cars or red flags, which can sometimes be the case here.

“Max led large portions of the race, but it was one of those Monacos where everybody pretty much behaved. So, yeah, the first stop, we got pretty close to Oscar at one point. He had a wobble on his second lap out after his pit stop but we would have been at best alongside, so we decided, look, we'll keep going, let's keep going.

MONDAY MORNING DEBRIEF: How Red Bull rolled the dice to give Verstappen the chance of an against-the-odds victory in Monaco

“The upside was, if there'd have been a Safety Car or red flag, Max would have led. Then, again, we had the medium tyre [for the second stint], went very, very long, obviously stopped on the last lap, and again, you're just hanging out for a Safety Car or VSC [Virtual Safety Car] or red flag at that point.”

Reflecting on the strategy of Verstappen's team mate Yuki Tsunoda – who started from P12 on the grid and ended the race down in P17 – Horner added: “For Yuki, we did the inverse – Lap 1 initially looked like he would get a significant benefit from it, but then everybody started to drive extremely slowly as they started to play around with the tactics.

It was a difficult race in Monte Carlo for Verstappen's team mate Tsunoda

“So he was basically on the same set of tyres for the whole race and did his fastest laps at the end there when he finally got some clear traffic. He was just sat in a queue the entire race, so a very difficult day today.”

In terms of how much the two pit stop rule affected the action of the race, Horner commented: “It was strategically more interesting [than last year]. There was more jeopardy to it.”

And when pushed on how much more of a challenge the squad had faced in trying to plan for their strategy beforehand, the Team Principal continued: “It was very dynamic.

“You're looking at all the different scenarios and it's starting to play out in front of you, what the others are doing with Williams and obviously Racing Bulls, and the teams that worked as a pair that had cars close together benefitted today, most of them.

“Usually you make the one stop and then you've just got your fingers crossed for reliability to the end of the race, [but] here there was a bit more going on.”

Race Highlights: 2025 Monaco Grand Prix

Now the attentions of the paddock switch to the Spanish Grand Prix – marking the final stop of a triple header sequence – and Horner is hopeful that Red Bull can repeat the success they experienced in Imola, where Verstappen scored his second victory of the season.

“Let's see,” Horner answered when asked how confident he was feeling about the team's prospects in Barcelona. “We always knew coming here [to Monaco] would expose some of our car's…. it was never going to be our strongest circuit.

“So going back to Barcelona, I hope we can replicate closer to what we did in Imola. We only gave away three points to the championship leader today, so we're still within a race win with, what,16 races still to go.

“There's an enormous amount of racing [left], plus the Sprint races, etc, etc, so there's a long, long way to go in this championship.”

Ferrari Team Principal Fred Vasseur has downplayed any suggestion of there being a rift between Lewis Hamilton and his race engineer Riccardo Adami, as he reflected on a Monaco Grand Prix weekend where the Scuderia performed better than anticipated, after Charles Leclerc finished just three seconds adrift of race winner Lando Norris in P2.

Coming to Monte Carlo off the back of a difficult race on home soil in Imola, where neither driver was able to make Q3, Ferrari played down their chances of a good result in Monaco. Yet as soon as Leclerc took to the track, he was fast and was only denied pole by a blistering lap from Norris.

Second place on race day was Leclerc's best finish of the season – and his second rostrum after picking up P3 in Jeddah.

“It's true that after Imola, the level of expectation was not mega high, because we were struggling [since] Miami, probably,” Team Principal Fred Vasseur explained.

Leclerc grabbed his second podium of the season in Monaco

“In Miami and Imola, we were struggling a lot in the low-speed corners, we were struggling in Quali. And the low-speed corners in Quali, it's key in Monaco. That means that the level of expectation was not mega high coming to Monte Carlo.

“But it's true also that after FP1, FP2, FP3, Q1, that the level of expectation was a bit different and we were a bit frustrated [Saturday] evening with P2. I think today, honestly, we did the job. It was difficult to expect much more starting from P2, except if something happened in front, but we can't ask much more to Charles and to the team today.”

Ferrari have had a number of struggles this year, both cars suffering with brake issues at times, as well as with bouncing and tyre warm up – especially in Qualifying. They have often found themselves behind some midfield cars on merit, and as such, Vasseur was pulling no punches when he analysed the first third of the season for his team.

“I think we didn't do a mega strong first part of the season... We underperformed compared to expectations, this is mega clear and we have to be honest with ourselves.”

But another positive from Monaco was Hamilton's performance, as one of very few drivers who managed to make up positions in the top 10. He jumped from seventh to fifth thanks to overcutting Isack Hadjar and Fernando Alonso in the first pit stops, but found himself too far back to challenge Max Verstappen for fourth.

“He lost almost 10 seconds more than the others when he joined the group of cars who were lapped,” explained Vasseur. “I don't remember who was in this group, but it was a difficult time for him.

“They were aware of the [lead] guys coming and a bit less with Lewis and he was alone. And compared to Verstappen who was ahead at this stage, we lost something like 10 seconds in this sequence.”

Hamilton finished fifth in Monaco, but was a long way behind the leaders 

The other thing Vasseur was asked to explain was a radio message from Hamilton to his race engineer Riccardo Adami – with Hamilton heard to ask Adami after crossing the line “are you upset with me or something?” to which he appeared to receive no answer.

But Vasseur was swift to dispel any rumours of discord between those two.

“Because when the driver is asking something between Turn 1 and Turn 3, we have to wait to the tunnel to reply, to avoid to speak with him during the corners. It's not that we are sleeping, it's not that we are having a beer on the pit wall, it's just because we have a section of the track where we agreed before to speak with him.

“And honestly, it's not a tension that the guy is asking something. He's between the walls... he's under pressure, he's fighting... he's at 300kph between the walls and I'm perfectly fine [with it],” he concluded.

""This is called 'The Handmaid's Tale.' It's her time as a handmaid. And at the end, she's nobody's handmaid: She's Onjune,"" says Miller, who spoke to THR along with star Elisabeth Moss about the Hulu series' ending and how sequel series 'The Testaments' comes into play.

[This story contains MAJOR spoilers from The Handmaid's Tale series finale, titled “The Handmaid's Tale.”]


The Handmaid's Tale‘s creator Bruce Miller always knew how he was going to end the series. A key location detail changed along the way and he didn't know how many seasons it would take to get there, or that Margaret Atwood would write a sequel novel in 2019. But he knew that when the show reached its ending, June's story would circle back to where it began, but with new perspective.




	“This is definitely not a story where you get what you want most of the time — or where June gets what she wants. It's a story about how to live with the things you can't get,” Miller explains to The Hollywood Reporter about the series finale.

	The 2017 pilot of the Emmy-winning Hulu series had introduced viewers to Elisabeth Moss as June, the woman readers first met as Offred in Atwood's best-selling 1985 novel of the same name. The pilot flashed back to June being separated from her husband Luke (O-T Fagbenle) and daughter Hannah (Jordana Blake) before reintroducing her as a handmaid, wearing a red cloak and white bonnet, while sitting in a windowsill in the home of Gilead Commander Fred (Joseph Fiennes) and his wife, Serena Waterford (Yvonne Strahovski).


	Viewers who listened carefully could hear a click before June then said in voiceover: “A chair. A table. A lamp. There's a window with white curtains, and the glass is shatterproof, but it isn't running away they're afraid of. A handmaid wouldn't get far. … My name is Offred. I had another name, but it's forbidden now. So many things are forbidden now.”


	Now with the series finale that began streaming on Tuesday, viewers understand that clicking sound was a tape recorder and that voiceover was a present-day June. In the series ender, aptly titled “The Handmaid's Tale” and written by Miller and directed by Moss, June is again sitting in that Waterford windowsill after revisiting the remains of the Boston home that burnt down midway through the series. Except now, Gilead's occupation is over and Boston is free, and June is beginning to record the tale we've been watching for six seasons.


	But this means that this tale has reached its end, and June (and viewers) didn't get the reunion they'd been hoping for since the start: The dystopian series doesn't end with June reuniting with her oldest daughter, Hannah. It ends with June continuing to fight for her.

	











	“When [Atwood's sequel novel] The Testaments comes out, you know certain things — you know that June's not dying, you know [her daughter] Hannah is still in Gilead. There's a whole other book about that story,” Miller explains of how the series finale sets TV's Gilead universe on its next course; Miller, also creator of The Testaments, began working on that adaptation ahead of the final season, with Eric Tuchman and Yahlin Chang showrunning season six. “You appreciate the end of the novel and why leaving you loose ends is still satisfying because you feel like, ‘This woman is still around. She made it this far,'” he adds. “If she didn't make it any further, that's okay, but what a story of her making it this far. It is the story of women through history.”


	The finale does — praise fucking be! — deliver the highly emotional mother-daughter reunion between Janine (Madeline Brewer) and Charlotte, facilitated by a revolutionized Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd) with Naomi's (Ever Carradine) consent; while Serena is handed a fate left open to interpretation, as she is once again a refugee without a home for her and son Noah. After the deadly penultimate episode with the High Commander deaths of Nick (Max Minghella), Lawrence (Bradley Whitford) and Wharton (Josh Charles), the finale updated viewers that Gilead will continue to fall across the once-United States and that June will be among the resistance, fighting undercover until she gets Hannah out. Luke vows to do the same.


	Following up on The Hollywood Reporter‘s oral history on the blazing success of the series and how it will launch The Testaments, THR spoke with Miller and Moss in separate conversations edited below about how they delivered a satisfactory yet realistic ending to the beloved, timely saga while also setting up the sequel series, which is currently in production. In that near future, Aunt Lydia is the starring character and Chase Infiniti plays Agnes, which we know is the Gilead name given to Hannah, June's daughter.

	











	***


Bruce, you recently told me that this is a story about living with what people can't get and how they survive. Before Margaret Atwood came to you with her plan to write sequel novel The Testaments, were you planning on reuniting June (Moss) with daughter Hannah? Or did that seem like too much of a neat ending for this world?


BRUCE MILLER It felt like it was tying it too much in a bow. Given where we started with June, that seemed like a whole other section of her life. This show was about June and her daughter and her husband and how she lost everything, and how she has gradually been pulling a lot of that back together. It's The Handmaid's Tale, not Hannah's Tale. It's focused on June's journey from handmaidness to freedom. The question of how she rebuilds her family felt like a whole other step, which we're seeing is a lot more complicated than just, “Let's all go to Alaska.” 


	We spent the season with June at first thinking, “I can dust off my hands and say, ‘I'm done.'” [If she stayed in Alaska with her mom and daughter Holly], that's what that would look like: The neat ending. But it didn't end up like that. June threw herself back in — she couldn't walk away from her daughter, Hannah. I think they say it in the book: There's plenty of stories from people who get their kids back. Those are the one-in-a-million stories we always tell. I want to tell the story about the 999,000 people who don't get their kids back. They have to go through life and live, and it's not easy. June is a good example of someone who doesn't ever take the easy way out, but this is as hard as things get in the world and you see what that does to somebody.

	











When Margaret said, “I'm writing The Testaments and this may influence what you do on The Handmaid's Tale,” she told me that she gave you a very small no-kill list: Aunt Lydia, and June's two daughters, Hannah and Nichole/Holly. 


MILLER Yes, a very small one. Lydia is a fucking cat. She has 900 lives, which is exactly how those people survived in those kind of regimes by being very good at stepping slightly out of the way when the shit starts to fall. Ann [Dowd] has taken that character in so many different directions and shown us doors to parts of her past and personality that we haven't opened yet. Aunt Lydia [by the end of The Handmaid's Tale] is just starting to realize that maybe Gilead was lying to her, and maybe it isn't just her “special girls” who deserve to be free. Ann has built that slowly, carefully in a believable way over time. Margaret and her are wonderful friends. It's a great pleasure to be able to continue that character [in The Testaments]. If you look at what happened just in this last season — Lydia's at the end of a rope and then she's back already in power by the end, which is totally her! 


	Margaret came to me as soon as she was having the inkling [of writing The Testaments], so it was very early for me to get the information. She let me know as the creator of the world that things might be shifting a little under my feet. The show went past the book, The Handmaid's Tale. So I was trying to come up with an ending that fit well and certainly I was playing with a lot of the things that she talked about doing in The Testaments. But this is called The Handmaid's Tale. It's not June's Tale. It's her time as a handmaid. And at the end, the final episode is that she's not a handmaid anymore in any way, shape or form. She's nobody's handmaid: She's Onjune.

	











ELISABETH MOSS I didn't have the task of writing [the ending], but I understand and I'm aware that that was the biggest challenge: The Testaments has Hannah not get out. That was definitely something we would have played with for the end of Handmaid's; June maybe getting her out. But we had to move towards the sequel that had been written. Now, I don't think that was a bad thing. But was it the thing that was probably most present? Yeah, I would say so.


Lizzie [Moss goes by “Lizzie”], did you know after season three that because of The Testaments [which released in 2019] that this show was going to end differently?


MOSS It was before I read it, because I spoke to Bruce about it. Then I read it and it was definitely like, “So that won't be our ending.”


Bruce, you have told me you always knew how the series would end. So, had you always imagined the final scene would be June saying those words that began her tale? Was that in your initial pitch for how you wanted to adapt the series?


MILLER Yes, it was in my pitch because it's really the story of the book. It was how you think about her as a character from the beginning. What is that voiceover? Where's it coming from? From the beginning, I was thinking, “So what we're watching is this box of tapes that someone found, just dramatized.” But it's this box of her story, her tale of being a handmaid. So I said that what I really wanted to do was that when you get to the end, you feel like you understood what you just saw and what it was as a full piece. I'm hoping that it felt satisfying as an ending for this story. 

	











MOSS What I connected to with June at the beginning was the same thing I connected with at the very end. She has this quality of wanting to survive, not only as herself, but to create a better future specifically her children but also for the next generation. That is her goal in life. I saw that in episode one, in that first script. I remember calling my mom and telling her that. And it's the same thing in the very last scene.


	For whatever reason, I'm not a stranger to doing work that somehow ends up becoming a part of the zeitgeist or becoming relevant in a very present way. Those aren't choices that I'm necessarily making on purpose. I've just gravitated towards material that is, for me, personal. This story was personal and my job is to tell the personal side of things, the human side of things. When it then goes out into the world and becomes political or something on such a larger scale, I'm grateful and moved by that.


Lizzie, when we spoke at the beginning of the final season, you said this ending was true to Bruce's vision, but that the location shifted. Now I understand why the location was so important.


MOSS The original idea was that June would maybe go to that cabin in the woods [that Luke and June hid out in near the border] from [a flashback in] season one, episode seven. June, Luke and Hannah were making pancakes — we call that the “pancake episode.” Originally, the idea was that June was going to go back there. And actually, before we started shooting, we established that cabin was still there. But then Bruce wrote a different location, and I think it's so much better.

	











	Originally, it was written that June goes and sits on the front steps of the Waterford house. And I said, “I want her to go inside. I think it would be so much more powerful if she goes into that room.” So I talked to Bruce and asked, “Can we go inside the house?” And he said, yes. He loved it, and so he wrote it so June goes inside the house.


MILLER I really wanted the ending to be June back and kind of reclaiming Boston. That old neighborhood was taken away from her, so reclaiming it and going back there is the end of that part of her story. She's back in the same place, but in a very different position. 


	In the book, she records [the tale] in a cabin in Maine and buries it in the ground. Lizzie and I had talked about that and we could have done that here, with her going back into Gilead at the end. But so much of the show had a sense of place and was so connected to Boston. Seeing her walk back through those streets and those places now as a free person is something that, as Alexis Bledel's character says, was impossible. And look, it happened. So we should adjust what's possible and what's impossible.


I understand the finale scripts were redacted for the cast, who were only privy to their parts in the episode. Did you, as director, close the set when filming this final scene to keep it under wraps?


MOSS I did close the set. Not to keep it secret, but mostly because I needed the set to be a very quiet space that day. When you're shooting the final scene of a show, it tends to attract some attention. So it was actually me as a director protecting my actor, who is me. I needed to be able to do my job that day, which was a very difficult job of ending a series as an actor and pulling off that final moment. So I closed the set for that reason. I also closed the set for the final scene inside the plane in episode nine [Whitford and Minghella's final scene before Lawrence and Nick's deaths].

	











MILLER It was a big thing to rebuild this [Waterford house] set. You have to make a commitment to the things you really want, and for Lizzie as director and me as a writer and both of us as executive producers, this was one of the things. Budgets are shrinking in Hollywood; our show is not any exception. When you get to the end of a show, you don't have money flying around, so we had to be careful with what we planned because we weren't going to be able to pick anything up afterwards. So we thought very long and hard from the beginning of the episode to make sure we protected that. You reduce the cost by giving [production designer Elisabeth Williams and her team] lots of lead time. But they had a lot of fun building the house interiors again. [The hallway to her room] goes up and down — there's a step up and then a step down. It feels like a [claustrophobic] funhouse staircase.


I can't think of another director who filmed themselves in the final scene of a long-running series.


MOSS That's a good question. That would be a fun fact to find out. But this cast, this crew has made me a better director. They made me a better actor. They made me a better producer. That post team made me better at what I do because of them. Every time I've been talking with [season six showrunners] Eric Tuchman and Yahlin Chang I tell them how I miss collaborating with them. I don't see why we couldn't at some point come back and do something. What's so great about the landscape now is that we could do something in a few years if we wanted to. There's nothing saying we can't. There are no rules anymore. But I do think where we end it is right. They did a brilliant job of wrapping it up.

	











MILLER Lizzie did such a great job. In these last couple of episodes, she pulled out new elements of her performance as June. It's amazing to do that, six seasons in. That scene with her and Serena [where June forgives her in the finale] is some of the best work [she and Yvonne have] done.


	It was very natural [for Lizzie to direct and act in the final episode], I think because we had been talking about it for a long time. You'd imagine it being a very internal situation, but she was as communicative with the crew as she always is. It was a group effort so for Lizzie, it was that collective experience she loves. I think there's very few people you can compare to, just on the amount that the show rests on them. In addition to directing and being an executive producer who is ingrained with the show — creatively, she works on so many different levels — I think it makes it easier in that final scene. Both Lizzie and I we're really confident about it. We knew what it was going to be. I wasn't even there. I was very happy for her to do it on her own. I knew she'd get it right, and she did.


Lizzie, were you listening to yourself [from the pilot] as you were saying your final lines?


MOSS I realized about 10 minutes before we shot it that I wanted to make sure that when I was speaking the final voiceover it matched the original voiceover from episode one. I wasn't sure if I wanted to do that or not, but I realized that I needed to match my mouth to [the pilot words]. We're setting up the final shot of the series, and I went on the Hulu app on my phone to episode one, and I just played it over and over and over again and memorized it in the cadence that I said it. I told our script supervisor that I can't get one word wrong. This has to be word-perfect. Then we did it, and it matches almost perfectly. There's a slight cadence change, when my body's going back and I lean forward, that we were able to fix in post. But what's in the finale is my voiceover from nine years ago.

	











Bruce always told us this show was June's tale, so she survives. Even still, the audience wasn't sure she'd make it through. I rewatched the pilot and knowing what you just said, that's wild and very meta.


MOSS Oh, that's awesome. [Using the pilot voiceover] is an idea that I had and I didn't know if it would work, and then it ended up working and it's so cool because there's something slightly disconnected about it that's really interesting. I think almost subconsciously as an audience member, you feel the meta nature of it, especially when she says, “My name is Offred.” And the [tape recording click] is in the pilot. After the door slams, you hear the click.


MILLER The click of the recording at the beginning, we put in the pilot. So we have been thinking about this particular moment since then.


I also don't know that there's another IP that got a sequel midway through, which then tasked the show with landing the plane but keeping the world open. 


MILLER That's the key here. I'm going to have to beg some flexibility. Most of the time, when you're adapting a book, the person who wrote it is not continuing the books. Sometimes they are with Game of Thrones. But most of the time, it was a book written in the past. In this case, there are great things about having Margaret around that outweigh the problem of her being able to change her world a little bit when she wants to. Of course she can do that. 


	But I think the way to look at The Testaments is that The Testaments book is a sequel to The Handmaid's Tale book, and there are things that are different between that and the show; timeline things that end up mattering because you want it to be consistent within the TV world. So [as creator of The Testaments], I'm trying to make a sequel to the TV show The Handmaid's Tale and make that work cleanly. There are things that actually contradict from the book to the TV show, but each adaptation has to be its own thing.

	











You left June — and also Luke, and likely Rita (Amanda Brugel) and Moira (Samira Wiley) — still out there in the ether of this TV universe fighting against Gilead. Moss is an executive producer on The Testaments, but there's no word about an onscreen role. What would you say to people who are hoping June will show up in The Testaments?


MILLER That's a good thing to hope for. I hope she shows up there, too. She's still doing her job, still doing what she was doing in The Handmaid's Tale. Luke and Moira are still out there somewhere, ringing the bell to get Hannah back. The beauty of having watched The Handmaid's Tale is that you understand there's this huge operation of people who are out there who care and who are risking themselves to get to reunite with their children. The people in The Testaments show don't feel that. But from experiencing Handmaid's, you know there's this whole operation. So is June influencing The Testaments? Absolutely. She's out there. She's trying to get Hannah back. Do we see her? I would love to see her. I love Lizzie Moss, she's awesome! She's very involved behind the scenes.


MOSS You're just going to have to watch the show. [Moss is currently filming the forthcoming Apple series Imperfect Women.] I won't be there [on set of The Testaments], which is different as a producer. But I can't not be hands on. I don't know how to do it any other way. And it certainly feels hands on, given the amount of emails!

	











So if we weren't going to get Hannah back, did you always know you were going to give Janine Charlotte back? Thank you for that!


MILLER Oh, my gosh. Yes. One of the things I always thought is that little girl looks so much like her. We had talked from the beginning, and a lot of it was about building Naomi and Janine to the point where that would happen. Building to where Naomi knows the one thing about Janine is that Janine is really tough, which she needs to know when she's [giving her daughter back]. Listen, I hope June does get Hannah back. But I'm hoping that people feel like this is the ending to Janine's story [that she deserves]. The fact that I'm not going to be able to work with or see Maddie Brewer every day is impossible to say out loud. 


MOSS Ever wasn't in that scene originally, and I asked if she could be there. I really wanted her to be a part of it. I felt that it was really important that Naomi is the one who hands Charlotte over to Janine. I felt like that was a story for Ever and for that character that needed to be her ending in the show. That Janine scene just kills me.


Could there be a place for Janine in the background fight in The Testaments?


MILLER I would be thrilled. I think you should imagine that all these people are in the background still fighting to save these girls you see in The Testaments. Fighting, fighting, fighting. As calm as it will seem in Gilead, as sweet and human and beautiful as Gilead is in The Testaments, you know that there are people pounding on the walls from the outside — and you've met those people. 

	











One character who may not be in that fight is Serena. I understand you had a different ending for her than the one that we saw. 


MILLER I don't believe “what people deserve” and all that stuff, but I wanted to kill her. Because I think she was such a horrible person and being dead on the side of the road completely anonymously [after she was pushed from the train in the beginning of the season] would have been a fitting end. I had to be convinced not to throw her off that train, along with the kid. 


Wow. 


MOSS Bruce did tell me his thoughts and he told me that he was toying with certain things. I'm not the writer, and I respect the role of the writer very much. So he told me what he was thinking and I thought, “Okay, that's interesting. Wow, that would be kind of crazy if she didn't make it.” But in my heart, I really wanted to see her survive because I'm Serena's biggest fan. I'm her biggest supporter and defender. I want her to live. I just think she deserves that, and I think Noah [her son] deserves that.


MILLER If it was Eva Braun and it was Hitler's kid, what would you do? I don't think anybody would hesitate. But I love what we ended up doing because what I really wanted for most of the characters is to get exactly what they wanted and see what happened. June got a ton of what she wanted and a ton of stuff she didn't expect, including Emily[‘s return], including reuniting with Luke, who she thought was dead at the beginning of the show. Serena's story really feels like the end of Serena's story, that she is someone who's never going to admit that she did wrong. But you can see how holding onto the illusion that she did right is getting very, very difficult. I love Serena. I love her to the point where I'm so much more mad at her because she should know better.

	











But to see June forgive her in the end felt like it gave the audience permission to accept that as well.  


MOSS That scene also kills me. I think it's beautiful. I couldn't read [Serena's ending] without crying. I can't watch it without crying. Yvonne's performance is magnificent. Each and every single one of these actors is at the top of their fucking game this season. And she did it in one take. That whole speech when she's talking to the baby. I get chills talking about it.


MILLER Circling back to their performances and the new things they all brought out in the final episode, they all did exceptional work. It's unfathomable that they would have these moments that you really feel are completely new and see different sides of the characters at the very last minute. 


MOSS Yvonne had the idea that she wanted to get to this place of acceptance and place of peace at the end. It would have been very easy to cut that scene shorter, but when we were in the edit I protected it because Yvonne wanted her character to find peace. You see this peace on her face where she realizes Noah is all she needs. That's all Serena ever wanted: Having a baby. I think her ending is my favorite ending in the series. It's so perfect.


Did Alexis Bledel [who left the series after season four] need convincing to come back or was she excited when she got the call from you?


MILLER We were both thrilled that it might work out. I think she was really excited when we talked. The only thing that was hard was the logistics to get her up for the time we needed. But no, it was not hard at all, and it wasn't hard to decide to try to see if she was going to be available. It was great having her back that day — except she cried and hugged people every four feet, it seemed emotionally difficult! But it was wonderful to see her and Lizzie get right back into it after all that time. It's like watching the fucking Yankees bullpen every day with these guys. They're so good.

	











MOSS Bruce talked to me about bringing her back a while ago, before there was even an outline or script. I think I said to him at the time, “You realize now that you've told me that, we have to do it.” It's not the easiest thing in the world to call an actor and be like, “Can you come back for this one episode?” They're busy. But I was like, “She has to do it.” I get very passionate about these things! And she wanted to do it from the beginning. She didn't need convincing at all. My first official scene on day one [on set] was with Alexis. So it meant a lot to get to work with her again. (Bledel spoke to THR about her return.)


Were there characters along the way who you considered killing but let live?


MILLER No, I don't really think about it that way. I think, do they end up in some place where they would die or not? By definition, the handmaid told this story. She had to live to the end, so the story is about her dodging explosions and stuff. That's part of the story. But the other people — I don't ever want to kill anybody, but I know that if I was in this group of people and Janine died, I would never recover. if Janine died and Alma [Nina Kiri] died, I would never recover. TV people die willy nilly. When people in your life die, it changes you. I don't know that June would be the same June if those people would have all been killed off. One of the reasons those people are in her memories is because they didn't die.


MOSS I hope people see the positivity [in the ending]. The final piece of music that plays over the credits is so hopeful. The piece of music [we chose] is from season four, when June tells Luke that she's pregnant. It's so much about the future and the future being brighter, and the next generation having a better chance. So the final decision that we made on the series is about the future. 

	











Does that mean we should find hope in June and Luke's final conversation? Because it was ambiguous.


MOSS Yes. I don't think I was so ambiguous! I definitely felt like there was hope in that future when I was standing there with him. We had this idea to play it like they were flirting with each other, like they had crushes on each other. Like, did they almost go back to the beginning? There's such a circular nature to the finale and absolutely I think there's a lot of hope for the two of them. But I think they have to kind of start again.

A war hero who worked with Otis Redding and The Furys, he appeared in four Clint Eastwood movies and portrayed lots of cops during his career. 


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	James McEachin, who wrote and produced songs for Otis Redding before turning to acting to portray cops on his own NBC Mystery Movie series and in 18 of the popular Perry Mason telefilms, has died. He was 94. 


	McEachin died Jan. 11 and was interred last month at Los Angeles National Cemetery.




	The familiar character actor also appeared in four films opposite Clint Eastwood: Coogan's Bluff (1968), Play Misty for Me (1971) — as the deejay Sweet Al Monte — Every Which Way But Loose (1978) and Sudden Impact (1983).

All in the Family aficionados know him for his turns as the IRS tax examiner who won't be bribed on the 1972 episode “Archie's Fraud” and as Solomon Jackson, a Black Jew whom Carroll O'Connor's character invites into his lodge to check off some diversity boxes, on the 1977 installment “Archie the Liberal.”

	











	A onetime contract player at Universal, McEachin starred as family man Harry Tenafly, a Los Angeles cop turned private detective, in Tenafly, created by Richard Levinson and William Link of Columbo and Mannix fame.


	One of the rotating, once-a-month NBC Mystery Movie shows that in 1973-74 included Dan Dailey's Faraday & Company and The Snoop Sisters, starring Helen Hayes and Mildred Natwick, Tenafly was the rare TV series back then to star a Black actor, but it lasted just five episodes.


	Later, McEachin played Lt. Ed Brock on the NBC Perry Mason telefilms that starred Raymond Burr (and, after his 1993 death, Hal Holbrook) from 1986-95. And he portrayed another police lieutenant, Frank Daniels, on the first season (1986-87) of NBC's Matlock, starring Andy Griffith.


	James McEachin was born on May 20, 1930, in Rennert, North Carolina, and raised in Hackensack, New Jersey. At 17, he joined the U.S. Army in August 1947.


	“When I saw those signs saying ‘Uncle Sam Wants You,' I swear I thought that bony index finger of his was pointing right at me,” McEachin told the Los Angeles Daily News in November 2021.


	McEachin spent more than two years in Japan as part of his first three-year term, then re-enlisted for another three years. As a member of the 2nd Infantry Division, he was wounded in an ambush and left for dead before being rescued. (He was awarded both the Purple Heart and Silver Star in 2005.)

	











	After the service, McEachin worked as a firefighter and a cop in Hackensack, then left for Southern California. Known as Jimmy Mack, he became a songwriter, composer, record producer, talent manager and label owner who worked with the doo-wop group The Furys (“Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart”) and Redding, whom he “brought into the business,” he said in a 2014 interview.


	He didn't think he was the “Jimmy Mack” in the hit 1967 song from Martha and the Vandellas. “I couldn't have been,” he said, “even though there are people who say to this day, ‘He's just trying to hide from it.' What is there to hide from?” (Songwriter Ronnie Mack was said to have been the inspiration for the tune.)


	McEachin was walking along Melrose Avenue one day when someone asked him if he wanted to be in a movie. He asked his wife if she thought he should do it. “She said, ‘Well, you might as well. You've bombed out on everything else you've ever done,'” he recalled with a laugh.


	That movie, shot in Bakersfield, California (not in the Deep South, as the poster said), was I Crossed the Color Line (1966), also known as The Black Klansman, produced and directed by Ted V. Mikels.


	“I didn't know you had to memorize dialogue,” he said. “I didn't know that you didn't have to just pose and do things naturally. It took me forever to learn that. Even though I didn't know anything about acting, I knew what bad acting was. I think I had a patent on bad acting.”


	However, before the decade was done, McEachin had signed with Universal and appeared in films including Uptight (1968), If He Hollers, Let Him Go! (1968), True Grit (1969) and Hello, Dolly! (1969) and on such TV shows as Dragnet, It Takes a Thief, Adam-12, The Name of the Game, Mannix, The Wild Wild West, Hawaii Five-O and Burr's Ironside.

	











	McEachin worked in the 1972 films Fuzz, Buck and the Preacher and The Groundstar Conspiracy before starring on Tenafly.


	After showing up on Insight, The Rockford Files, Police Story, Emergency!, Columbo, T.J. Hooker, St. Elsewhere, Murder, She Wrote and Hill Street Blues, McEachin signed up for his first Perry Mason movie, 1986's The Case of the Notorious Nun. He stuck around through 1995's The Case of the Jealous Jokester.


	He said he turned down a role in Steven Spielberg's The Color Purple (1985) because he was offended at how his character was written.


	In 2002, McEachin played a liberal Supreme Court justice on First Monday, a short-lived CBS drama from Donald P. Bellisario that starred James Garner and Joe Mantegna.


	McEachin was appointed a U.S. Army Reserve Ambassador in 2005 to spend time speaking with soldiers and veterans. A year later, he wrote, produced and starred (with David Huddleston, a castmate on Tenafly) in a 23-minute video called Old Glory that the military community embraced.


	His one-man play, Above the Call; Beyond the Duty, opened at the Kennedy Center in Washington in 2008 and played L.A.'s Mark Taper Forum three years later. He portrayed Old Soldier, a character who “pries open tough issues left in the wake of battle, boldly confronting challenges that are facing those serving in our military today while reconciling the spirit of one who has killed in war.”


	McEachin also wrote several books, including 1996's Tell Me a Tale: A Novel of the Old South, 1997's Farewell to the Mockingbirds, 1999's The Heroin Factor, 2000's Say Goodnight to the Boys in Blue and 2021's Swing Low My Sweet Chariot: The Ballad of Jimmy Mack, a memoir.

	











	His wife, Lois, whom he married in 1960, died in July 2017.

The two films delivered the biggest Memorial Day picnic in history at the box office, while 'Lilo' supplanted Tom Cruise's 'Top Gun: Maverick' as the holiday's top opener of all time, among numerous other feats.

Senior Film Writer


	Stichin: Mission!


	Disney's live-action redo of Lilo & Stitch and Tom Cruise's final Mission: Impossible movie, from Paramount and Skydance, fueled the biggest Memorial Day weekend of all time as attendance skyrocketed across all demos.




Lilo & Stitch blew away all expectations with a record-smashing, four-day domestic debut of $92.7 million, and a jaw-dropping $361.3 million globally, while Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning opened to a series-best $79 million domestically and nearly $200 million worldwide, according to final weekend actuals (M:I's tally was up from Sunday's estimate of $77.5 million). The numbers include a three-day weekend gross of $145.5 million for Lilo and $64 million for Final Reckoning. On Memorial Day itself, Lilo earned a near-record $37 million.

	The previous best Memorial Day in terms of overall revenue belonged to the $306 million in ticket sales collected in 2013 when Fast & Furious 6 zoomed to $117 million, followed by The Hangover Part III with $50 million. This year also marked the best showing for two Memorial Day titles going up against each other.  In 2007, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End opened to $140 million over the holiday frame, followed by Shrek the Third with $67 million.


	While the mashup isn't quite the same cultural phenomenon that Barbenheimer was in July 2023, the potent combo of the two movies can't be ignored in terms of conquering and dividing.


	The female-fueled Lilo was always expected to beat the latest male-driven M:I title, but no one imagined it would hit these heights and, in an ironic twist, see Lilo & Stitch supplant Cruise's Top Gun: Maverick ($160 million) to rank as the biggest Memorial Day opener of all time, not adjusted for inflation. That's not the only irony: Cruise-starrer Minority Report barely beat the original animated Lilo & Stitch when they opened opposite each other in June 2002. In North America, Lilo also zoomed to the second-biggest gross of all time for any four-day holiday weekend behind the $242 million opening of Marvel and Disney's Black Panther ($242 million) and the third biggest debut ever for a Disney live-action title, both domestically and globally, behind Beauty and the Beast and crown-holder The Lion King, not adjusted for inflation. The film also saw Disney become the first studio of the year to cross $2 billion in worldwide ticket sales

	











	Three weeks ago, Lilo & Stitch was tracking to open to $120 million. On Thursday, that number had grown to $165 million. Then it came in even higher. The reason? Thank members of the Gen Z generation and younger Millenials.


Stitch isn't just drawing interest from families; to the contrary, 60 percent of ticket buyers were non-parents and kids, far higher than the norm. Interest exploded among teenage girls and younger women adults who grew up on the first movie and resulting TV show about a Hawaiian girl with a fraught family life who adopts an adorable, albeit trouble-making, dog-like alien. Box office pundits say the nostalgic factor ran red-hot, just as it did among millennials and Gen Z'ers for Disney's live-action Aladdin, which made $1.1 billion in global ticket sales after getting non-families. Rideback produced both Lilo and 2019's Aladdin.


	It is also playing to a notably diverse audience. Latinos, the most frequent moviegoers in the U.S., made up 33 percent of ticket buyers, while the film scored the biggest opening ever for a live-action Disney reimagining across Latin America.


	Both films benefited from strong scores from critics and glowing audience exits, including five-out-of-five stars from moviegoers polled by industry-leading service PostTrak. Lilo has a Rotten Tomatoes critics score of 70 percent and nabbed an A CinemaScore from audiences.


Final Reckoning — which had a lock on Imax screens — more than made up for the lackluster $54.7 million five-day bow of Dead Reckoning, as well as supplanting the $61.2 million three-day launch of Fallout to set a new franchise opening record. M:I movies have never been big openers since diehard fans are usually older adults, and particularly older males. Ticket buyers over the age of 55 made up the largest chunk of the audience (or a whopping 58 percent), followed by the coveted 18 to 24 demo, according to PostTrak. Cruise's film, directed by his go-to partner Christopher McQuarrie, boasts a current Rotten Tomatoes score of 80 percent and earned an A- CinemaScore.

	











	“Mission accomplished,” says Paramount domestic chief of distribution Chris Aronson. “This is a remarkable result for the eighth title in a franchise that's 30 years in the making.”


	A major challenge in terms of Final Reckoning‘s financial success is its $400 million net budget before marketing — making it one of the most expensive films ever made — although Paramount insiders note that each new installment increases the value of the entire library, including a spike in home entertainment sales and rentals of previous titles. Lilo & Stitch cost a modest net $100 million to make.


	Overseas, Lilo & Stitch likewise went up against Final Reckoning nearly everywhere, although the M:I movie began rolling out in a handful of major markets last weekend via previews.


More to come.

""It felt right to bring closure to her journey,"" says the actor about their cameo.


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


[This story contains specific spoilers from The Handmaid's Tale series finale, titled “The Handmaid's Tale.”]


	While looking into a window marked with the words, “Freedom,” June (Elisabeth Moss) and viewers of The Handmaid's Tale heard a familiar voice.




	“Blessed be the fruit.”


	The voice belonged to Alexis Bledel, who returned as Emily in the series finale of the Hulu series, which began streaming Tuesday.


	Her arrival was as much of a surprise to June (Elisabeth Moss) as it is to the audience who hasn't seen the OG handmaid since Bledel left the series after season four. Bledel, an original star who earned four nominations for her role on the Hulu dystopian series, departed without a specific explanation.

					Streaming Ratings: 'You' Final Season Hits No. 1		
			









	While the fifth season was in production, Bledel had said, “After much thought, I felt I had to step away from The Handmaid's Tale at this time. I am forever grateful to [showrunner] Bruce Miller for writing such truthful and resonant scenes for Emily, and to Hulu, MGM, the cast and crew for their support.”


	The series then explained her character Emily's absence in the fifth season premiere, when June is told by Emily's wife, Sylvia (Clea DuVall), that Emily decided to go back to Gilead to fight and find Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd), and that she called to say goodbye to her family, which included a young son. When June pushes to go save Emily, Sylvia tells June not to go after her, convinced they'll never see Emily again. “It's what she needed to do,” says Sylvia. “She's gone.”


	Bledel spoke to The Hollywood Reporter for a recent oral history on the series and about her return, which was an idea from series creator Bruce Miller, who wrote the final episode, “The Handmaid's Tale,” which was directed by Moss.


	“It was an immediate yes,” she says of coming back for the series ending cameo. “It felt right to bring closure to Emily's journey and offer the audience a sense of completion. Bruce put together such a kind and talented group, and so many of the original crew were still there in season six. The production runs like a well-oiled machine — everyone brings their best. I'm excited to see what they create in [sequel series] The Testaments.”


	In Emily's return, she and June continued the full-circle theme of the final season by walking — in two — through the streets of a freed Boston after an embrace that called back their very first scene of the series (when, in voiceover, June called Emily a “pious little shit”). Long gone are their red cloaks as their city is now out from under Gilead's rule after success from the guerrilla resistance Mayday movement to take down the (fictional) fascist regime.

	











	Emily filled in the lost time, telling June she was a Martha for a Commander who was a friend and that she kept in touch with Sylvia and her son. “So, you weren't just gone?” says June. “Of course not,” says Emily. “They're the reason I'm fighting.”


	The friends stopped in front of the wall and Emily pointed out the miracle of them being alive, together, to read the hopeful and inspiring words before them written by women who are now free from Gilead. Next to the messages are two hanging guardians — instead of the familiar sight of two hanging handmaids, or Marthas, or “traitors.”


	Emily urged June to adjust her definition of “impossible,” and Bledel's cameo then ended with a dream sequence where June imagined if there never was a Gilead. June, Emily, Moira (Samira Wiley), a two-eyed Janine (Madeline Brewer), Rita (Amanda Brugel) and killed handmaids Alma (Nina Kiri) and Brianna (Bahia Watson) are seen laughing, embracing and singing Fleetwood Mac's “Landslide” in a karaoke bar.


	“I hope viewers take away to keep hope alive when things seem impossible,” Bledel adds to THR of her cameo. “Even if it seems like seeds you plant couldn't possibly grow, plant seeds of hope anyway. You never know; they might find a way.”


	When speaking to THR about the series finale, Moss said that once Miller shared his early idea of bringing Bledel back for the final episode she was seton making it happen. Turns out, Bledel agreed. “I said to him at the time, ‘You realize now that you've told me that, we have to do it.' It's not the easiest thing in the world to call an actor and be like, ‘Can you come back for this one episode?' They're busy. … And she wanted to do it from the beginning. She didn't need convincing at all. My first official scene on day one [on set] was with Alexis. So it meant a lot to get to work with her again,” said Moss.

	











	Miller added that her day back on set was a hug-fest. “She cried and hugged people every four feet,” he said, adding that “it was wonderful to see her and Lizzie get right back into it after all that time. It's like watching the fucking Yankees bullpen every day with these guys. They're so good.”

Welcome to Hogwarts.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



HBO's Harry Potter TV series has found its Harry, Ron and Hermione. The trio of Hogwarts freshmen are newcomers to Hollywood.


	This time, Dominic McLaughlin will play Harry Potter, Arabella Stanton is Hermione Granger and Alastair Stout is the new Ron Weasley. In the films, those roles were played by Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, respectively. There were eight Harry Potter films and a series of three Fantastic Beasts movies — a spinoff of the original IP. Author J.K. Rowling wrote seven Harry Potter books; the eighth book in the series was split into two movies.

	“After an extraordinary search led by casting directors Lucy Bevan and Emily Brockmann, we are delighted to announce we have found our Harry, Hermione, and Ron,” showrunner and executive producer Francesca Gardiner and executive producer and director (of multiple episodes) Mark Mylod said in a joint statement. “The talent of these three unique actors is wonderful to behold, and we cannot wait for the world to witness their magic together onscreen. We would like to thank all the tens of thousands of children who auditioned. It's been a real pleasure to discover the plethora of young talent out there.”


	HBO very publicly hosted an open casting call to find this next installment's new kids. Previously-announced cast can be found here.


	The Harry Potter series, not (yet?) officially titled “Harry Potter,” to be clear, will be “a faithful adaptation of the beloved Harry Potter books,” HBO says. The series will stream on HBO Max (fka Max, ffka HBO Max — it's a whole thing).


	The HBO series is produced in association with Brontë Film and TV and Warner Bros. Television. It is executive produced by Rowling, Neil Blair and Ruth Kenley-Letts of Brontë Film and TV, and David Heyman of Heyday Films.


Harry Potter the series will begin production this summer for a 2026 rollout.


	See the new kids below; you can probably figure out who is who.

Wallen earns his fourth Hot 100 No. 1, and McRae her first.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, blasts in at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.


	The collaboration between the country and pop stars – from Wallen's new album, I'm the Problem, which soars in at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with 2025's biggest week by equivalent album units – is Wallen's fourth Hot 100 leader and McRae's first. She surpasses her prior No. 3 best set by “Greedy” in January 2024. In March, McRae notched her first Billboard 200 No. 1 with So Close to What; she's the first artist this year to lead both lists for the first time.


	Wallen previously topped the Hot 100 with “Love Somebody,” also on I'm the Problem, for a week upon its debut in November; as featured on Post Malone's “I Had Some Help,” which bowed at No. 1 in May 2024 and led for six weeks; and with “Last Night,” for 16 weeks beginning in March 2023, before wrapping as the chart's top hit that year.


	Wallen boasts six songs in all in the latest Hot 100's top 10, with “I Got Better” also debuting, at No. 7, and “Superman” flying 16-8 in its second week on the chart. He has now charted nine top 10s from I'm the Problem; only Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department and Midnights (10 top 10s each) have yielded more, with Drake's Certified Lover Boy also having generated nine.


	Meanwhile, Wallen claims the top three spots on the Hot 100, with “What I Want” followed by “Just in Case” at No. 2 and “I'm the Problem” at No. 3 – as he becomes the first artist that primarily records country music to have monopolized the top three in a single week over the chart's 66-year history.


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated May 31, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, May 28 (a day later than usual due to the Memorial Day holiday May 26). For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“What I Want,” on Mercury/Big Loud/Republic (with Wallen and McRae two of its six writers), becomes the 1,180th No. 1 in the Hot 100's archives, and the 83rd to debut on top. It tallied 31.2 million official streams, 3.9 million radio airplay audience impressions and 2,000 sold in the United States in its first week of release (May 16-22).


	The track also launches at No. 1 on Streaming Songs, where it's Wallen's fifth leader and McRae's first. Being promoted to pop and adult radio, it enters Adult Pop Airplay at No. 32 and Pop Airplay at No. 38, as well as Country Airplay at No. 55.


	“What I Want” concurrently debuts as Wallen's 11th No. 1, and record-extending eighth to open at the summit, on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart. McRae leads in her first visit to the genre ranking.


	The single is the 30th to have topped both the Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs, dating to 1958, when the former originated and the latter became the country genre's singular Billboard songs chart. It's the first such hit of 2025, following four each in 2024 and 2023, the most in a year since 1975; it's the 10th this decade, after only two led over the previous 36 years.


	Wallen adds his record-extending fourth shared Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs No. 1. Glen Campbell, John Denver, Dolly Parton, Kenny Rogers and Taylor Swift follow with two each.


	While Wallen is from Sneedville, Tenn., McRae is from Calgary, Alberta (a mere 2,136 miles away). Billboard's Paul Grein recently chronicled every Hot 100 No. 1 by a Canadian artist, with McRae becoming the 29th such act to rule. She's the seventh woman, joining Celine Dion (four No. 1s), Nelly Furtado (three), Carly Rae Jepsen, Avril Lavigne, Alannah Myles and Anne Murray (also one each).


	Wallen boasts six songs in the Hot 100's top 10. After “What I Want” at No. 1, he follows with “Just in Case,” up from No. 11 to a new No. 2 high, surpassing its prior No. 4 peak; “I'm the Problem” (6-3, after reaching No. 2); “I Got Better” (a debut at No. 7); “Superman” (which leaps 16-8 in a single bound for a new best); and “Love Somebody” (18-10, following a week at No. 1 upon its debut last November). With three new top 10s, he ups his count to 18 in his career – the most for any artist that has primarily recorded country music.


	Wallen is the first core country artist to infuse the Hot 100's top 10 with at least six songs simultaneously; Taylor Swift (a record 10 in both 2024 and 2022, following her mid-2010s segue from country to pop), Drake, Kendrick Lamar and 21 Savage have also achieved the feat.


	Wallen also becomes the first country act to hold the Hot 100's top three spots simultaneously. Only five other acts have tallied such triples: The Beatles, for five weeks in 1964; Swift (three, 2022-24); Drake (three, 2021-23); Lamar (two, 2024-25); and Ariana Grande (one, 2019).


	Meanwhile, “What I Want” is Wallen's first song released with a woman artist. Collaborations by men and women have topped the Hot 100 for all but three weeks this year, as “What I Want” follows Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” (13 weeks at No. 1) and Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” (five). The current streak of 14 weeks on top, as “What I Want” dethrones “Luther,” marks the longest by collaborating male and female acts since a record 25-week run in 2016 via Drake's “One Dance,” featuring WizKid and Kyla (nine), Sia's “Cheap Thrills,” featuring Sean Paul (four), and The Chainsmokers' “Closer,” featuring Halsey (12).


	Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, Alex Warren's “Ordinary” dips to No. 4 from its No. 2 high.


	Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” falls to No. 5 after 13 weeks atop the Hot 100. It adds a 22nd week at No. 1 on both the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts – tying Lamar's “Not Like Us” (in 2024-25) for the longest command on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (dating to October 1958, when it became the genre's singular songs ranking).


	Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” slips 3-6 following five nonconsecutive weeks atop the Hot 100 beginning in January.


	Plus, Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” slides 4-9 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning last July.

					By Max Goldbart 

International TV Co-Editor


	The HBO Harry Potter series has found its three leads.


	Newcomers Dominic McLaughlin, Alastair Stout and Arabella Stanton have been cast as Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. They will play the starring roles in a TV epic that will span at least a decade. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint did the same for the hit blockbuster movies.


	Showrunner Francesca Gardiner and director Mark Mylod said: “After an extraordinary search led by casting directors Lucy Bevan and Emily Brockmann, we are delighted to announce we have found our Harry, Hermione, and Ron. The talent of these three unique actors is wonderful to behold, and we cannot wait for the world to witness their magic together onscreen. We would like to thank all the tens of thousands of children who auditioned. It's been a real pleasure to discover the plethora of young talent out there.”

	











	A whopping 32,000 kids had auditioned for what are undoubtedly three of the biggest TV roles of the coming decade. 


	McLaughlin, Stanton and Stout will now prepare for cameras to roll, which will happen this summer at Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden with the first season set to air in 2026. They are all relative TV newcomers. McLaughlin has a role in the BBC's upcoming action adventure series Gifted while Stanton played Matilda in Matilda The Musical in London's West End across several months.


	The process to find the Boy Who Lived and his two best friends has gone on for months and months, we revealed in our deep dive several weeks back, following a much-publicized open callout published by the show's casting director Bevan, which asked for children aged between nine and 11 as of April 2025 who were residents of the UK and Ireland. The call specified a commitment to “inclusive, diverse casting” and asked that, for each role, agents “submit qualified performers, without regard to ethnicity, sex, disability, race, sexual orientation and gender identity.” The initial round asked candidates to submit two videos, one performing a short story or poem and the second asking them to talk about themselves as well as “a family member, friend or pet that you are particularly close to.”


	Adult cast so far revealed for the high-profile HBO adaptation include Paapa Essiedu taking on potions master Snape, John Lithgow as head master Albus Dumbledore, Janet McTeer as Minerva McGonagall and Nick Frost as Rubeus Hagrid.

	











	Given the number of audition tapes that were submitted for Harry, Ron and Hermione, sources have previously told us it is likely that many other young cast members will be drawn from said tapes, allowing Bevan's team to more easily locate the future Draco Malfoy, Dean Thomas and Cho Chang. Some of the Weasley's in particular, of which there are six brothers including mischievous twins Fred and George, could be drawn from those who didn't quite make the cut as Ron.


	The series has been described as a “faithful adaptation” of the beloved books and is being exec produced by the source material's author J.K. Rowling, who has attracted controversy aplenty for remarks around trans rights over the past few months. It will land on the recently re-rebranded HBO Max (formerly HBO Max then Max). The series is written and executive produced by Gardiner. Mylod will executive produce and direct multiple episodes of the series for HBO in association with Brontë Film and TV and Warner Bros. Television. The series is executive produced by Rowling, Neil Blair, and Ruth Kenley-Letts of Brontë Film and TV, and David Heyman of Heyday Films.


	Stanton is represented by Gavin Mills and Julie Gordon at Olivia Bell, and Public Eye.

	See the IG post below.


	“This weekend was one for the history books!” Cruise writes. “Congratulations and thank you to every filmmaker, every artist, every crew member and every single person who works at the studios.

	“To everyone that works at Paramount Pictures and Skydance, thank you for your many years of partnership and unwavering support,” the actor continued. 


	“And most of all, THANK YOU to audiences everywhere for whom we all serve and for whom we all LOVE to entertain. Sincerely, Tom.”


	In addition to M:I, Disney's Lilo & Stitch had a massive $341M global opening, with the two films combined setting a four-day Memorial Day weekend record.


	At this month's Cannes Film Festival, Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning was just greeted with a 7½-minute ovation inside the Grand Théâtre Lumière. 


	“I'm just very grateful, very grateful for 30 years to be able to entertain you with this franchise,” Cruise told the crowd afterward the applause. “Grateful for my friend [director Christopher McQuarrie] every step of the way — what you've done, how you've expanded it, how we just went beyond our expectations. Your absolute care, your talent. You're an amazing human being. It's been a real privilege, a real pleasure, and I look forward to making a bunch of other kinds of movies with you.”


	Cruise then told the audience, “We just want to thank you all. Thank you so much for everything, for allowing us to entertain you. It's very special.”


Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning is playing in theaters nationwide from Paramount.

					By Jake Kanter 

International Investigations Editor


Pierce Brosnan may be Irish by blood, but his MobLand accent has been met with a chorus of disapproval following the premiere of the Paramount+ series.


The Irish Times pilloried his “mangled” vocal work as a “horror for the ages,” while other critics have bemoaned the performance as a “distraction” from the Guy Ritchie-directed gangster drama.


	Brosnan was born in Drogheda, County Louth, but the James Bond star has spent much of his life in England and the U.S. 


	In an interview with Radio Times, Brosnan was asked about the backlash and said that mob boss Conrad Harrigan's accent is quite different from his own native tongue.

	“My own accent is very soft … Conrad's accent is a million miles away from me,” he explained, adding that his performance was the result of a suggestion from his dialect coach. 


	“I told him that I needed a Kerry accent,” he added. “So he gave me the name of a man, and I Googled the guy and that was it. It was a Kerry accent. And so, I just gave it full tilt.”


	Brosnan, who admits his Irish accent has “dissipated to the mists of time,” previously told Dave Moore on Today FM that he had raised concerns about his task with Ritchie.


	“Last summer I spoke to Guy for the first time about it and having read the five episodes he said not to worry about it,” the actor added. 


	It's not all bad news for Brosnan. Irish GQ writer Ben Allen said critics are “being a little harsh” on the performance, and he is “largely pulling off what seems to be a semi-thick Kerry accent.”

It's been a disappointing night for Taylor Swift fans, as the pop superstar appeared to be snubbed at the 2025 American Music Awards.

Swift was a no-show at the star-studded event on Monday, May 26, despite much anticipation from her avid supporters. Many had been awaiting a major announcement from the singer after fans supposedly spotted clues hinting at a big reveal during the awards show.

But even if she had attended, Swift would still have walked away empty-handed, even though she earned six nominations this year.

A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)

For this year's AMAs, Swift was nominated for six categories, including, Artist of the Year, Album of the Year (“The Tortured Poets Department”), Collaboration of the Year (“Fortnight” feat, Post Malone), Favorite Touring Artist, Favorite Female Pop Artist, and Favorite Pop Album.

However, the “Anti-Hero” singer failed to take home any awards, much to fans' surprise. It marks the first time Swift has been shut out of all categories she was nominated for at the AMAs.

Swift has won a record-breaking 40 American Music Awards over the years, Billboard noted.

The singer's absence at the 2025 AMAs may not come as a surprise to some, though. This year, Swift has only been present at two major events, the Grammy Awards and the Super Bowl.

A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)

Meanwhile, Swifties rallied behind the singer amid the AMAs snub. One fan wrote on Instagram, “That was the worst awards show ever y'all made us watch,” while another chimed in, “I'm so confused about our chairwoman not winning anything tonight.”

A disappointed fan wrote, “I watched the AMAs for nothing it seems,” while another added, “This is not adding up. Not even one award?!”

One user also commented, “Thank you Taylor, for your music and inspiration and the delight of being your fan. I'm sorry the awards didn't reflect the incredible joy you give to us all.”

Some fans were even more disappointed after speculating that the singer would announce “Reputation” (Taylor's Version) at the awards show.

One fan wrote, “Well nothing was announced. I'm just gonna cry myself to sleep now.”

Another noted, “I guess why we didn't get the announcement of rep tv is because AMA didn't give any single award to Taylor. How is she going to announce the new album without going to the stage?”

A fan also commented, “Can you guys please stop giving Easter eggs when nothing is coming? It's literally getting so annoying. We wouldn't expect anything if the eggs weren't egging.”

Prior to the AMAs, Swifties have been searching for clues about Swift's highly-anticipated re-recording of her 2017 album, “Reputation.”

The Robertsons announced the passing of patriarch Phil Robertson on May 25. He was 79. The family has used social media as a way to pay tribute to the man who touched their lives in numerous ways. Phil's son, Willie Robertson, shared his thoughts on the loss of his father in an emotional message, which he posted on Instagram on May 26.

Willie posted a collection of photos of himself and his father from throughout the years. There are some pictures from his childhood, as well as other, more recent photos. In the caption, he reflected on their time together and the bond they shared.

A post shared by Willie Robertson (@realwilliebosshog)

“Looking back at pics I noticed he was always looking at me funny, prolly trying to figure out, ‘How did this boy turn out like this?' I remember in 8th grade bringing my boombox in the living room and doing a break dance routine for him as he sat on his recliner,” Willie wrote. “He just looked strangely at me and said, ‘Well, I've never seen anything quite like that!' I took it as a compliment.”

The moment was repeated decades later, when Willie shared that toward the end of his father's life, he did another dance for him. “In a much weaker voice, he simply said, ‘Will, you got moves I didn't know you had.' Not sure why I was always dancing in front of Phil. Maybe I figured it was the last thing he would think I would do, so I just did it.”

Willie also reflected on the things that his dad taught him. “I watched him, and knew he had figured out so many things,” he wrote. “Most importantly, he taught me the value of sharing my faith with others. He was the Real Deal, the same on Sundays as Fridays. Most of our conversations were not about hunting or business, but about sharing the Gospel. I was never more proud that when I printed my book, Gospeler, for him to read first. I wanted him to know what he had passed down to me. He read it in one sitting and said, ‘That's the best explanation of the Good News I have ever read…and you were so nice about it!' That made me laugh because sometimes he would forget about the nice part.”

A post shared by Korie Robertson (@korie.robertson)

Willie's post also highlighted the last words that his father said to him, telling him, “You're my brother.” Willie continued, “It made total sense to me. He always told me we were coworkers in the Kingdom of God. Maybe that's why I always just called him Phil. Not sure if he is up in Heaven now doing his own dance moves for our Father.”

He concluded his post by expressing his love for his dad and how much he would miss him. But also thanked him for the values he instilled in him. “Thank you for raising me the right way and teaching me the most important lesson to prepare me for the day you passed on,” Willie wrote. “Not sure how people deal with loss without the Lord. We may be wrong about all this….but I doubt it! Sleep well Dad, can't wait to see you.”

Fans reacted to the post with condolences and mentions of how “Duck Dynasty” had positively impacted their lives.

It was previously announced that Phil had Alzheimer's Disease. “Dad's not doing well at all. It's definitely progressing,” Willie told Us Weekly on May 20. “And mom has shown the same type of symptoms of Alzheimer's or dementia. It's just part of life — and mom has her good days.”

The Robertsons will make their reality TV comeback with “Duck Dynasty: The Revival,” set to air on June 1 at  9 p.m. ET on A&E.

“Elio” (opening theatrically June 20), Pixar‘s first intergalactic buddy comedy, takes an animated leap into space with imaginative design and visual splendor, utilizing a mixture of old and new techniques. The footage screened at Pixar was funny and, in one tender scene, very moving.

It's about 11-year-old orphan Elio (Yonas Kibreab), who's obsessed with getting abducted by aliens and finally gets his wish when he's mistaken for Earth's leader. Elio beams up to the candy-colored interplanetary space station of peace and security called the Communiverse, where he bonds with worm-like alien Glordon (Remy Edgerly), who's just as lost and friendless. That is, until Elio's found out and sent back home to the Air Force base where he lives with his stressed-out aunt Olga (Oscar winner Zoe Saldaña).

“Elio” is very much a post-COVID film about loneliness and the search for belonging that afflicts many children. Still grieving the loss of his parents, Elio has trouble fitting in socially with the other kids on the Air Force base, while his aunt has difficulty coping with her new role as an adoptive parent. The film was the brainchild of Adrian Molina (co-director of “Coco”), who conceived it as a personal coming-of-age story about youthful alienation. He grew up on a military base and didn't find “his people” until studying animation at CalArts.

But Molina's first solo opportunity ran into some speed bumps, and he was taken off “Elio” by chief creative officer Pete Docter and reassigned to “Coco 2” as co-director with director Lee Unkrich. Madeline Sharafian (the “Burrow” short) and Domee Shi (“Turning Red”) jumped aboard as the new directors. Sharafian, who contributed storyboards to “Elio,” previously served in that capacity on both “Coco” and “Turning Red.”

“We were really trying to infuse that feeling of loneliness into ‘Elio' and his wanting to belong somewhere, his deep desire to connect but not really knowing how,” Sharafian told IndieWire. “I think a lot of young people just want to make friends, they want to find their people. But they think if I'm in the perfect place where everyone thinks like me, acts like me, then I can belong. That will be the solution to all my problems.”

“But really that solution comes from within,” Shi told IndieWire. “It's about making that first step — reaching out to someone. It's more than that typical ‘I want to go into space and explore.' It's much deeper.”

 










Here's what we learned about “Elio”:

For his last Pixar film before retiring, veteran production designer Harley Jessup (“Coco,” “Ratatouille,” “Monsters, Inc.”) devised an experimental process to find the look of Communiverse in collaboration with visual effects supervisor Claudia Chung Sanii (“Zootopia,” “Brave”). He called it the “College Project” in the spirit of exploration. They utilized VR and macro photography in water tanks similar to his early work on ILM's “Inner Space.” One test shot was actually recorded sideways in a drinking glass at a Pixar party. Another took oil and water in a glass bowl set on top of a sheet of sequins and glitter.

“I   was able to bring some of that back into research on tiny, microscopic plants and animals,” Jessup told IndieWire. “And how alien they look is still part of the natural world that the audience would recognize and feel believable.  And everybody just picked up on that and ran with those ideas. Tests from every corner that were just astounding: oceanic characters that are outside of the ocean that are in our space, swimming through the atmosphere rather than water because their gravity is different.”

The goal was to create a unique, dazzling version of space that hasn't been seen on film before, made of  luminescent and translucent materials with gravity that is very fluid to accommodate the different species. The result was a space station housing 16 member planets that live in four different ecosystems that are represented on a series of rotating discs. There's a volcanic hot disc, an icy cold disc, an aquatic disc, and a verdant blush disc. 

 










The rotating discs are often shown backlit like colorful stained glass.  The embassies are situated on the disc that most closely matches the climate of the delegation's home planet. The basic construction of the four parabolic discs starts with topographic layering similar to 3D computer-generated relief maps. This precise sculptural quality adds a sense of technology to all the universe sets.

On “Elio,” Pixar brought lighting and camera together at the same time, thanks to a new interactive lighting toolset called Luna. This enabled them to crack the aesthetic much earlier to guide our eyes and tell the story.

 ”When we first started seeing artwork from Harley and his team, we really sought out to build this space we've never seen before, and, to me, the only way to do that was to bring everybody on the crew together into one room,” Chung Sanii told IndieWire. “And we quickly realized lighting happens last in CG, which is strange because, in live action, lighting and camera happen at the same time.

“So Pixar was developing Luna, which bring lighting to all interactive workflows,” she continued. “We got that pre-alpha of a look at that, and that's when we discovered this universe could really work: all the luminance and the translucency that Harley was putting in there. Although the tool wasn't ready for prime time, I think future movies are using it even more. It forced us to have our lighting DP, Jordan Rempel, start at the same time as Derek Williams, our layout DP. So they were always designing and planning and working on shots together. It made such a huge difference to be able to have that time to create with the lighting team and the layout team to see the potential, and we would change things on the set to plus what they had roughed out.”

 










The worm-like Glordon from the volcanic planet was one of Pixar's favorite aliens. Like Elio, he's lonely and doesn't fit in with his culture, where he's expected to don military armor and become a fierce warrior, like his father, Lord Grigon (Brad Garrett).  Gordon's design was influenced by Pixar's studies of larval insects and microbiotic creatures such as the tardigrade. Finding the right balance of disturbing and adorable was a big challenge. Another was finding expression in a creature without eyes.

“ I think part of what was special for me comes out in the first moments that you meet [Glordon],” animation supervisor Jude Brownbill told IndieWire. “He's sort of mysterious, creepy, off-putting, a work with a bunch of teeth.” But then one of the creepiest-looking characters becomes the one who puts the biggest smile on our face. “ Elio and Glordon develop into this really charming, heartfelt, empathetic friendship,” he added

Then there's OOOOO (Shirley Henderson), the liquid, shapeshifting supercomputer. Because of the dynamic effects involved, she marked an unprecedented technical and artistic challenge. Indeed, OOOOO is described as a Swiss Army knife made of droplets moving in space with moving circuitry inside her. The fluidity and charm came as a result of 2D testing. 

 










“She's so flexible as a character,” animation supervisor Travis Hathaway told IndieWire. “ She can become a screen, she can become a vinyl player, she can become a projector, she can manifest as a pen for Elio to write with. We leveraged some facial rigging and animation techniques that we learned on ‘Win or Lose.' You can use different forms and have them come together at render time.”

Directors Sharafian and Shi wanted to deepen Elio's motivation for wanting to be abducted by aliens. This meant raising the emotional stakes for his loneliness and making him more empathetic. A part of this was turning him into an orphan, shifting Olga from mother to aunt.

“ Knowing that Elio was going to have to decide where he wanted to be, it felt like a relationship with a mother and son was a bit too much,” Sharafian said. “Maybe they have an argument and they storm off, but, at the end of the day, you still kind of believe in your heart as an audience member that they're gonna come back together. But an aunt and a nephew [relationship] is a lot more tenuous.  There's a chance that they'd split off and lose that connection forever. And that tension for the audience watching these two characters who are missing connections, you're really rooting for them, that added a lot of juice.”

 










“ And I feel like I identified more with Olga as an aunt,” added Shi, “who suddenly has to like be saddled with this huge responsibility, and she's trying her best, but she wasn't prepared for it. And she's trying to navigate it day by day. It just felt really compelling. And she's lost too.”

Luca Guadagnino continues his visionary stamp of approval on rising artists — like Sundance Grand Jury Prize winner Hailey Gates' “Atropia” or recent arthouse favorite “April” from director Dea Kulumbegashvili —  with another festival favorite newcomer. Giovanni Tortorici, who brought his writing/directing feature debut “Diciannove” to the Venice Horizons section last year, is Guadagnino's latest find. And he's about the U.S. audiences' find, too, as this restless coming-of-ager about a reckless young man is coming to stateside theaters on July 25. IndieWire shares the exclusive trailer. Watch in the video above.

 










Here's the synopsis: “A bold, brash and unflinching coming-of-age drama, ‘Diciannove‘ (the film's title translates to ‘nineteen' in Italian) follows the highs and lows of a restless youth as it collides headlong into the concrete realities of adulthood when Leonardo (Manfredi Marini), a teenager from Palermo leaves home for the first time. His studies land him in Siena, by way of London, where he clashes with his instructor, the curriculum, and most chaotically, with himself.” (Read IndieWire's review here.)

Guadagnino discovered Gen Z Sicilian filmmaker Giovanni Tortorici when he worked as an assistant director on Guadagnino's HBO miniseries “We Are Who We Are.” Tortorici's slippery debut “Diciannove” is an exuberantly directed coming-of-age story about a 19-year-old (hence the title) on a journey from a dead-end stint at business school to discovering his love of the Italian classics — and beautiful men and women.

Leonardo will remind you of the great coming-of-age characters, like Jean-Pierre Léaud as Antoine Doinel in the films of François Truffaut, as Tortorici crafts a bildungsroman about his hero's sentimental and literary education. He's got strong opinions about filmmakers, including Pasolini — whose “Salò” Leonardo jerks off to in a scene that plants the seed for a much darker film beneath the surface — and is eventually labeled as someone incel-adjacent by a literary mentor. Leonardo's sexuality is also ambiguous, with an interest in men and women hinted at, and also a fascination with a group of Siena teenagers who you can't tell if he wants to fuck them, kill them, or be them. At one point, Leonardo looks up Justin Bieber's nudes, which the filmmakers used without any permission or clearance, knowing the pop star will probably never see this film.

 










But Tortorici doesn't necessarily identify with the darker impulses you might read into the character, while explaining in an IndieWire interview at Venice last year that this film is torn directly from the pages of his own life. Look out for “Diciannove” in theaters from Oscilloscope July 25.

[Editor's note: The following contains spoilers for ‘Final Destination Bloodlines.']

The secret to directing the Skyview from “Final Destination Bloodlines” hides in plain sight. But for Adam Stein and Zach Lipovsky, striking the right tone was as much about the big picture horror as it was the funny little details. The pair met while making Steven Spielberg's “On the Lot,” a reality competition show from 2007. Now, they're on-track to deliver the highest-grossing chapter in a treasured 2000s franchise.

“What make the guys so successful is casting that wide net and seeing what they get,” said editor and frequent collaborator Sabrina Pitre. Fresh off another victory with Eli Craig's “Clown in a Cornfield,” she's already hard at work cutting Lipovsky and Stein's next film, “Freaks 2.”

Pitre says the directors' knack for truly valuing talent is what helped capture so many moments that make “Bloodlines” feel special. Warner Bros. and New Line's triumphant sequel is a win for so-called “fans” of freak accidents everywhere — and a testament to the style Stein and Lipovsky have been developing since before “Final Destination” went dormant.

“They trust us all as professionals and they want all of these different departments to give their A game, so we can all bring something new to the table and find things they otherwise wouldn't have thought of,” said Pitre.

Kicking off in 1968, “Bloodlines” opens on a high-rise restaurant disaster. The structural collapse at the Skyview is in strong contention for the all-around best massacre of the series — featuring an ocean of slapstick visual effects and essential backstory that makes the core of the movie. Yes, the scene boasts some outrageously entertaining kills, but also anchored in a pitch-perfect showing from star Brec Bassinger, it's more emotional than the sum of its “Looney Tunes”-like parts.

“We have all sorts of different ways that we like to keep the performances feeling fresh,” said Lipovksy. “Whenever possible, we always shoot the movie as written, and we'll also do takes where we let them say other things in the moment. There's a lot of that in this movie. We have really funny jokes and things that came from improvs, but we also do silent takes where we run the scene and no one talks.”

 










Fan-favorite character Erik Campbell sees the magnetic Richard Harmon ripping through one-liners faster than you can pull a Prince Albert piercing through flesh — but Bassinger's dreamy first impression as a scream queen was essential to the entire script's success. Introduced and killed off over the course of “Bloodlines,” Iris Campbell (also played by 70-year-old Gabrielle Rose) steps in as a legacy final girl à la Jamie Lee Curtis for a universe that's never had a main character.

“We would do an improv take, where they'd be like, ‘Don't say any words! Just say what you're feeling,'” Bassinger told IndieWire. “Then, we would do a silent take, which I had never done that before. I'd never even heard of that, where we do the entire scene, but we didn't speak.”

Dovetailing Iris's “Final Destination” debut with the late Tony Todd's bittersweet exit, Bassinger found her character's most important beat during a silent take. “Bloodlines” hinges on a soap opera-like investigation into a family tree that only exists because Iris, her husband Paul (Max Lloyd-Jones), and their unborn baby escape the Skyview. Her premonition also saves jazz singer Evie (Natasha Burnett) and her son, the legendary William Bludworth. (5-year-old Jayden Oniah plays Todd's iconic role here.)

 










“There's this moment where Evie catches me about to throw up and she's like, ‘How far along are you?' I'm like, ‘Oh, I'm not pregnant!' And then there's a moment where I look down, I see that my hand is on my stomach, and then I look back up,” said Bassinger. “It feels silly, but in the moment when you're taking away the words and you're just focused on the intent, I think there are some really great moments created from that.”

“There's so much power behind an expression,” said Pitre. “There's a tendency with dialogue to over-explain things and not let the audiences figure it out for themselves. Silent takes allow that. They allow the actors to get outside of their heads and live in the moment, and as an editor, I really pick up on that. They're little bits of gold, honestly.”

On creating emotional tension while editing the scene, Pitre continued, “We spent so much time with the buildup in the Skyview to make sure that we were in love with these characters and I feel like the second we see Brec on camera, I was just like, ‘Oh, wow.' There's something about her presence that just blew me away. She's just a natural and it really comes across. Your heart just breaks for her.” 

Not too uptight but still plenty exacting, “Bloodlines” boasts an almost bouncy scare style and an intuitive pop-comic feel. Lipovsky said, “One of the things we've learned over the years is often when you're writing the script and you're putting everything in there and you're making sure it's all explained carefully, sometimes an actor can just give you all that information without saying anything.” 

 










He continued, “Because it's cinema and the person's face is 70 feet across in the movie theater, that can be often more powerful. We love trying that in all our movies.

Speaking on Death's Design as an opportunity to exemplify craft, Stein said, “What comes for these characters are little insert closeup shots that all connect to each other in this mousetrap Rube Goldberg way, which is so much fun as a filmmaker because it's really the filmmaking that's coming for the characters.”

“It's the way the shots are designed and planned that creates the suspense that leads to the deaths,” he said. “It was such a joy as a director to get to play in that sandbox.”

Bludwurth's farewell speech was original dialogue too, spoken straight from the heart of the actor. Asked about working with Todd, Lipovsky noted the “Candyman” was nothing like his often-menacing character. Stein confirmed that with another spur-of-the-moment story.

“His favorite thing about being on set was meeting his mom and the kid who played the younger self,” Stein said. “They weren't shooting that day, but they came to meet Tony because he so wanted to meet them. He was like, ‘I get to meet my mom today!' It just tickled him so much and he was so excited. He was a little kid.”  

 










From Warner Bros. and New Line, “Final Destination Bloodlines” is now in theaters.

Cyberpunk movies are certain that in a near-distant future, AI will conquer humans by discreetly simulating reality, trading digitally archived POV memories, or cloning us entirely. As we crawl closer to—or even surpass—cinema's fictional predictions each decade, those doomsday themes remain the same. It's not hard to imagine why. But synth-punk mavericks MSPAINT don't subscribe to leather-clad assassins or red-pill propaganda as salvation. From its inception in 2019, the Mississippi band has crafted galvanizing, anthemic records about using positivity to push back against the world's harms. Not to be mistaken for blind optimism or egotism, their earnestness is instead candid and community-oriented. No Separation, their latest EP, ups the stakes of their digitized punk, offering an urgent call-to-arms befitting our own dystopia offscreen.

No matter how blown-out the bass or experimental the synths were on Post-American, their 2023 debut album, MSPAINT were bound to become louder and more hardwired on their eventual follow-up. Following three tours of Europe last year alone, a dream that they never imagined happening, the four-piece returned to the sticky air of home—Hattiesburg, Mississippi—both exhausted and energized. No Separation sounds like MSPAINT clawed their way out of the mainframe to get there, hair jolted upright and fingertips singed, fueled by determination. Buffering the band's sound with metal bristles are producers Julian Cashwan Pratt and Harlan Steed of Show Me the Body, who accentuate MSPAINT's flirtations with industrial music. “Wildfire” rattles with Randy Riley's sliding bass and a thundering beat from Quinn Mackey, their amped-up rhythm section begging to soundtrack a Strange Days chase scene through a seedy '90s nightclub. Nick Panella is the star of the EP, though, with synth manipulations that evoke Arabic maqam melodies (“Surveillance”), pixelated chords that turn into cascading fuzz (“Drift”) and retro dream sequences (“Angel”); Cyberpunk 2077 developers will retroactively wish they commissioned MSPAINT to score the video game.

MSPAINT preach the power of community, one they've built alongside other bands—like Militarie Gun and Soul Glo, whose vocalists both appear on Post-American—and various outspoken punks they've met on tour. This strength helps Deedee, the band's free-spirited vocalist, express unabashed hope in spite of a world desperate to snuff the quality out, whether yelling about profit margins benefitting evil, our own complicity in broken systems, or the refusal to cede your power as a worker. “If this world is falling apart, why don't we just fall together?” Deedee proposes; draped with skittering hi-hats and synth effects, the view from up there looks stunning. Across No Separation, Deedee preaches words of revolution that could double as sci-fi movie poster pull-quotes: “We were not born to form in lines,” “It's not your world. It's been bought,” “Are you not tired of waiting for nothing to save you?” If MSPAINT rooted their past music in mindfulness, this EP posits that civil disobedience is the foundation of collective enlightenment.

“Disillusioned by the truth/that you're a part of the problem/and that scares you to death/but don't be afraid,” Deedee yells on “Wildfire” before the next song cues up a distilled lesson on Marxism and communism. It's both an admittance of a wrong and a promise to do better. MSPAINT haven't deluded themselves into thinking they hold the operations manual for our global ticking time bomb, nor do they frame themselves as the heroes of our modern-day cyberpunk story. No Separation acts more as a trusted narrator prompting reminders on the screen: You don't have to cave to hierarchical pressure. The workers hold the power. Take it one day at a time. “This is just today,” Deedee sings during the EP's final seconds. The same will be true tomorrow and a century from now.

Donald Trump announced on Monday that he pardoned a MAGA sheriff right before the sheriff was set to serve a 10-year sentence for federal bribery crimes. 


	Former Culpeper County, Virginia, Sheriff Scott Jenkins was found guilty of giving civilians police badges in exchange for thousands of dollars, amassing more than $75,000 in bribes. According to prosecutors, he made unvetted D.C.-area business owners unpaid auxiliary deputies, which gave them police powers. The business owners wanted to be able to avoid traffic tickets and be able to carry concealed firearms without a permit. 


	Jenkins was sentenced in March after a jury convicted him of all counts in December. He was indicted in 2023 on counts of conspiracy, wire fraud, and bribery. 


	“Sheriff Scott Jenkins, his wife Patricia, and their family have been dragged through HELL by a Corrupt and Weaponized Biden DOJ,” Trump posted on Truth Social. 


	“This Sheriff is a victim of an overzealous Biden Department of Justice, and doesn't deserve to spend a single day in jail. He is a wonderful person, who was persecuted by the Radical Left ‘monsters,' and ‘left for dead.' This is why I, as President of the United States, see fit to end his unfair sentence, and grant Sheriff Jenkins a FULL and Unconditional Pardon. He will NOT be going to jail tomorrow, but instead will have a wonderful and productive life.”

	











	Prosecutors said Jenkins put some of the bribe money in his campaign fund, but he kept the rest for himself. He has denied any wrongdoing. “I believe wholeheartedly in the president,” Jenkins said in April during a webinar hosted by the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association. “I believe if he heard the information, I know he would help if he knew my story,” he added.


	During the trial, Fairfax County business owner Rick Rahim testified that he was barred from owning a firearm. In exchange for $25,000 in cash and a $17,500 home-construction loan that was never repaid, Jenkins deputized him so he could own a gun.

	Two undercover FBI agents said they were made auxiliary deputies and then gave Jenkins $5,000 and $10,000 cash. 


	“Scott Jenkins violated his oath of office and the faith the citizens of Culpeper County placed in him when he engaged in a cash-for-badges scheme,” Acting United States Attorney Zachary T. Lee said at the time of Jenkins' sentencing. “We hold our elected law enforcement officials to a higher standard of conduct and this case proves that when those officials use their authority for unjust personal enrichment, the Department of Justice will hold them accountable. I am grateful to the FBI for their tireless work on this investigation.”

	











	In 2019, Jenkins said he would deputize county residents if the legislature were to enact more gun control rules. “I plan to properly screen and deputize thousands of our law-abiding citizens to protect their constitutional right to own firearms,” he wrote on Facebook.

	Trump has pardoned other supporters, including to about 1,500 defendants who participated in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. 


	“No MAGA left behind,” Ed Martin, the pardon attorney at the Department of Justice and former interim U.S. attorney for D.C., posted on X. He added: “Thank you, @potus Trump, for pardoning Sheriff Jenkins!”

	When Rage Against the Machine‘s Tom Morello took the stage at Boston Calling Music Festival on Sunday evening, his solo set featured a pointed message. On the screen behind him, a graphic compiled nearly two dozen buttons that read and spelled out “Fuck Trump,” labeled the president a “tyrant,” and referred to him as the “Hater in Chief.” Addressing the crowd, Morello said: “Welcome, brothers and sisters, to the last big event before they throw us all in jail.”


	Morello used the performance to join the legion of musicians backing Bruce Springsteen in the musician's recent standoff with Donald Trump. “Bruce is going after Trump because Bruce, his whole life, he's been about truth, justice, democracy, equality,” Morello said. “And Trump is mad at him because Bruce draws a bigger audience. Fuck that guy.” The guitarist performed a cover of Springsteen's “The Ghost of Tom Joad” in solidarity. 

Trump is gonna love Tom Morello's backdrop for his set @bostoncalling at Harvard's athletic complex 🔥….btw Tom is a Harvard alum!📷by @CallItAsISeeIt7 pic.twitter.com/fE5vOOfnnr


	Elsewhere in his set, Morello performed Woody Guthrie's “This Land Is Your Land,” a song he learned in the third grade only to later discover that essential lyrics were removed from the version he knew. “It's a beautiful song, but they censored out all the verses that explain what the song is really about,” Morello said. “This is a revolutionary anthem. Woody Guthrie knew that music could be … an uplifting, unifying, transcendent thing; a defensive shield, and a weapon for change. Authoritarians and billionaires think this country belongs to them. Woody Guthrie knew that this land is yours.”

	











	His account of the song mirrors recent sentiments that Neil Young shared in his own stance against Trump. “Bruce and thousands of musicians think you are ruining America. You worry about that instead of the dyin' kids in Gaza. That's your problem. I am not scared of you. Neither are the rest of us,” Young said last week. “You are forgetting your real job. You work for us.” 


	Morello isn't only representing musicians in this battle. He also showed support for his alma mater, Harvard University, at the festival, which is held at the Harvard Athletic Complex. The Ivy League school recently sued the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, and the Department of Justice in response to the Trump administration's attempt to block the university from enrolling international students. Earlier this month, the Department of Education froze all federal grant funding to Harvard over their refusal to bend to their demands.

	The musician put a spotlight on the free course “We the People: Civic Engagement in a Constitutional Democracy,” which is available online through the university. Morello explained that the course is “basic U.S. government, understanding the Constitution, and how to recognize a dictatorship takeover of your country.” An honors student, he graduated from Harvard in 1986 with a B.A. in political science.

	At another moment in his set, Morello flipped his guitar over to reveal a message printed on the back that read: “Fuck I.C.E.” Since taking office, the Trump administration has shown repeated noncompliance with court orders mandating due process for migrants in its immigration practices that have led to the detainment and deportation of U.S. citizens, too. 


	“No retreat baby,” Morello wrote on X, referencing his set. “No surrender.”

	Into every generation, a hangout sitcom is born — light on plot, and heavy on the chemistry of a group of young adults spending way too much time together in the big city. Gen X had Friends. The millennials had too many to count, including New Girl, How I Met Your Mother, and Happy Endings. Gen Z hasn't quite had its own moment yet, in part because most show creators are at least in their thirties, in part because the TV business assumes that most of Gen Z is getting their video on nontraditional platforms. (Maybe there's a Gen Z equivalent of Happy Endings appearing in quick bites on TikTok?) There have been a few recent college sitcoms created by millennials, including The Sex Lives of College Girls and Overcompensating, but the territory is mostly wide open to be explored, especially by writers who aren't that much older than the characters they create. 


	The new FX/Hulu comedy Adults will have a hard time becoming a generational touchstone, if only because everyone consumes media in so many different ways today. But it's a promising addition to the legacy, written by and about twentysomethings, full of silliness and friendly vibes in equal measure. 

	











	Created by Tonight Show writers Ben Kronengold and Rebecca Shaw, who were 27 when they sold it to FX, Adults follows a group of friends who are all spending their post-college years living in the Queens childhood home of Samir (Malik Elassal), whose parents are off on a seemingly never-ending world tour. Samir grew up with Billie (Lucy Freyer), and went to college with Issa (Amita Rao) and Anton (Owen Thiele, who's also in Overcompensating). Relatively new to the group is Paul Baker (Jack Innanen), Issa's easygoing boyfriend and someone who is — like Will Tippin on Alias, Colin Robinson on What We Do in the Shadows, and Jordan Catalano on My So-Called Life — only ever referred to by his full name. 


Adults wastes no time getting its tone across, with an opening scene where Issa decides the best way to combat a subway masturbator is to loudly gratify herself at the same time, not noticing or caring that everyone else in the car is now filming her — and that the pervert she's trying to shame is aroused by her stunt. The series is loaded with stories where the quintet takes the worst possible approach to solving a problem, while also having no real interest in privacy or decorum.

	When Issa learns that an outer-circle friend may have been molested, she grabs her phone and does talk-to-text dictation: “Kyle, comma, molested, question mark?” In another episode, she finds herself in a hospital chapel while Billie is getting a procedure and vents to a “nondenominational god” about the fact that Paul Baker seems capable of having fun without her. She's having the worst day, she laments, “and I know that sounds cringe, because there are cancer kids here.” 


	Issa is the most narcissistic, least self-aware of the group, but they're all in their own bubbles to varying degrees. In the season's third episode, the housemates are both shocked and not shocked that Anton has become friendly with local menace “the Bayside Stabber” because he has a tendency to be “a friend slut,” acting intensely interested in total strangers, swapping a few texts with them, then forgetting they exist. (He has 4,000 unread texts in his phone.) In a subplot, Paul Baker and Samir visit a pawn shop to try to sell a gun Samir doesn't want in the house, but Paul Baker struggles to talk to the owner, who seems progressive in his actions and beliefs, and completely retrograde in his language. (After the man non-judgmentally uses an old slur to describe a developmentally disabled sister he clearly loves, Paul Baker tells him that nobody uses that word anymore: “The cast of Glee kinda did that through the power of song.”)

	That episode is the high point of what I've seen of the eight-episode debut season, an impressive blend of farce, social satire, and character comedy, and an excellent spotlight on what all five actors do well. Other installments are more hit-or-miss, particularly in their use of cringe comedy. The fifth episode, where Billie makes an ass of herself in front of the friends of her much older boyfriend (played by Daredevil himself, Charlie Cox), while Samir tanks a job interview, is so uncomfortable that I pondered several times whether I had the intestinal fortitude to finish it. 


	Mostly, though, the chemistry among the leads, and the sense of extreme, detailed intimacy the writers give the characters, makes it all work. The second episode begins with Billie on the toilet, as the other housemates walk in on her one by one, all of them not only comfortable being in the room while she's there, but asking whether she's peeing or pooping. (They also have Billie's menstrual cycle committed to memory.) Another episode establishes that the group periodically gathers to assign unilateral rules to one another, like Issa ordering Billie to stop going back to her old high school whenever she feels sad. (Given that Cox is her former English teacher, this clearly doesn't work.)  

	











	No good comes from a comedy trying to declare itself a standard-bearer for its entire generation. (When the first episode of Girls had Hannah wonder if she was “a voice of a generation,” many viewers assumed they were meant to take this as a statement by Lena Dunham, rather than a sign of Hannah's self-delusions.) Fortunately, Adults doesn't try. There are occasional references to the characters' age bracket and how older generations feel about them — Bille thinks everyone believes “we're neurotic, irresponsible, directionless, [and] that we lie about using menstrual cups” — but not so much that it feels like the intended point of Adults. All it wants to be about is five funny people being funny together.

	“Always thought the world was gonna be waiting for me,” laments Samir at one point, “and instead, everyone's annoyed that I'm here.” Anyone who watches this show (all at once on Hulu or weekly on FX) will be much more amused than annoyed. 


The first two episodes of Adults debut May 28 on FX, with later episodes releasing weekly. All eight episodes begin streaming May 29 on Hulu. I've seen the first six episodes.

Benson Boone brought the magic to the American Music Awards stage today. The singer performed a characteristically spirited rendition of his recent single “Mystical Magical” at the 2025 awards.


	Boone came out onstage wearing a Seventies-inspired purple floral suit, dazzling the audience from his very first note. During his performance, the singer made sure to fully engage fans and attendees alike when he walked off the stage into the crowd. Boone gave a cheeky nod to his 2025 Grammys performance by stopping by to say hi to Nikki Glaser and Heidi Klum, who were sitting front row, and got the rest of the audience dancing.


	Of course, the singer managed to incorporate a perfectly executed flip into his performance.

	This is Boone's first time at the AMAs, with the musician up for five awards, including New Artist of the Year and Favorite Male Pop Artist. His breakthrough hit, “Beautiful Things,” was also nominated for Song of the Year, Favorite Music Video, and Favorite Pop Song.

	











	As for “Mystical Magical,” Boone released the song last month after debuting it at Coachella. It's slated to appear on his second album, American Heart, which is arriving June 20. Before releasing “Mystical Magical,” Boone teased the album with “Sorry I'm Here for Someone Else,” while more recently he dropped the soulful tribute, “Momma Song.” 


	In a recent Rolling Stone cover story, Boone spoke about American Heart, describing the album as “very Bruce Springsteen, Americana, like a little more of a retro vibe.” While he admitted he's not sure the album has another hit as massive as “Beautiful Things,” he also said achieving that wasn't his top priority as an artist.

Authorities investigating a strange sphere that could be a UFO

Residents of Buga, Colombia were minding their business when the sky decided to drop a plot twist right into their backyard: a mysterious metallic sphere with no explanation, no owner, and absolutely no chill.

This thing landed like a statement piece. Now, authorities are investigating, scientists are scratching their heads, and the internet is doing what we does best: losing our damned minds.

In early 2025, residents of Buga (a small city in western Colombia) spotted a blue metallic orb flying overhead. There was no sonic boom, no fiery trail, no “ET phone home”… just a solid sphere falling quietly, like it missed its spaceship's last stop and bailed.

When authorities recovered it, they found a basketball-sized object weighing around 4.5 pounds, with no visible seams, welds, screws, or panels. Just bowling ball smooth. Like it had been forged by gravity-defying space elves or printed by a 3D printer from the year 3047.

Inside, X-rays revealed a cluster of 18 smaller spheres arranged neatly around a central chip. That's either:

Adding to the weirdness, the sphere was reportedly cold to the touch, and had ancient-looking symbols etched around the surface —some said runes, others said Mesopotamian, and one guy on Reddit swore it was a message from Atlantis.

Naturally, the word UFO got tossed around faster than conspiracy theories in a Facebook comment thread. After all, it's 2025. We've had Congressional hearings on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). We've had former Air Force officials claim the U.S. is reverse-engineering recovered “craft.” So yeah, the public is primed for mystery or, at the very least, a good plot twist.

But while the sphere looks like it belongs in a sci-fi museum, there's nothing (yet) to prove it's from another world. No propulsion system, no energy signature, no attempt to abduct anyone's livestock.

Enter Dr. Julia Mossbridge, physicist, biophysicist, and potential buzzkill—unless she's right. “It looks to me like a really cool art project,” she said. The materials, the perfect shape, the “symbolic” interior—all of it screams conceptual installation with a hint of techno-mysticism.

Her argument? If it's art, then it's doing exactly what art's supposed to do: make you question your reality, your place in the universe, and what kind of budget modern artists have these days.

“If an artist is doing this, why?” she asked. “Because we're learning we don't understand what's in our skies. Or in our backyards, apparently.”

Of course, not all theories require aliens or artists. Some require only a little caffeine and a love of absurd math. What if —and hear us out— this sphere is just the tip of a giant BIC pen?

We ran the numbers. A regular BIC pen tip is about 0.7 mm wide. If this sphere (about 24.6 cm in diameter) is the ballpoint scaled up… the pen would be 52 meters long. That's 172 feet. That's a skyscraper-sized pen. Imagine the kind of galactic bureaucracy that requires that much ink.

We call it: BIC Titan™ — Made to Sign Treaties from Orbit.

Right now, the Colombian government hasn't ruled anything out—or in. They're running tests, scanning materials, and trying to figure out who, if anyone, wants to claim responsibility.

No agency has stepped forward to say, “Oops, that's ours.” No companies, no defense contractors, not even an anonymous Banksy-type artist trying to cash in on the viral moment. Just crickets, confusion, and conspiracy threads.

Until someone fesses up, or it starts glowing and sending GPS coordinates, the Buga Sphere will remain part of that wonderful category of modern phenomena: “unexplained, weird, and kind of beautiful.”

Scientists in Colombia are currently studying a mysterious sphere, dubbed the Buga Sphere, believed by some to be an unidentified flying object (UFO). The object was spotted flying over Buga, in the Valle del Cauca department of western Colombia, on March 2 and was later recovered in the area. The sphere's unusual characteristics have sparked global attention and fueled speculation about its origins.Researcher Jose Luis Velasquez, who inspected the object, noted that it shows no welds or joints, features that would typically indicate human manufacturing. ""It is a very rare piece ... I've never seen a piece like this,"" Velazquez said, according to People magazine. He and his team conducted X-ray scans on the sphere and discovered it consisted of three metal-like layers and contained nine microspheres in its interior.  Velazquez believes that the lack of welds or joints bolsters the theory of the sphere's extraterrestrial origin. He added that the sphere appears to have mysterious symbols carved on its surface. Witnesses reported seeing the orb floating erratically in the sky, zigzagging before crashing near a forest. These observations have led some to conclude that the object could be a UFO.Dr. Julia Mossbridge, a member of the University of San Diego Department of Physics and Biophysics and the founder of the Institute for Love and Time (TILT), expressed skepticism about the sphere's origins. ""It looks so human made to me,"" she told Fox News. Mossbridge suspects the Buga Sphere might be a piece of artwork rather than an object of alien technology. Advertisement""It looks to me like a really cool art project,"" Mossbridge said, advising against jumping to conclusions too quickly. She urged thorough vetting before declaring anomalies in mysterious discoveries. ""Before you decide something's anomalous or a UFO, bring the object to a group like the Galileo Project,"" she suggested, referring to the international research initiative founded by Harvard University astrophysicist Avi Loeb, which aims to rigorously study potential extraterrestrial artifacts.Mossbridge framed the mysterious object as part of a bigger picture in which humanity must confront its own limitations. ""We are entering a time when we don't have the control that we thought we had,"" she noted. She explained that prior grandiose beliefs in total mastery blind society when ""something shows up that doesn't fit our model of the world."" The physicist emphasized the importance of using non-governmental, non-partisan research groups like the Galileo Project and the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies to investigate such phenomena. ""They are all trying to get rigorous information themselves, not necessarily waiting on the federal government, about what's going on in our skies, what's going on in our waters, and actually trying to get international cooperation around these things,"" Mossbridge told Fox News.

AdvertisementShe also highlighted the potential for discoveries like the Buga Sphere to foster international collaboration. ""Because, for instance, the sphere in Colombia is in a different country. So, what are the rules about how we deal with something that's interesting that's found there?"" she asked.While the sphere is currently being studied by researchers in Mexico, the next steps for identifying its origin remain unclear.The Pentagon and NASA have recently addressed the topic of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP). A November 2022 report from the Pentagon documented numerous instances where balloons, birds, and satellites were mistakenly identified as UAPs. Similarly, a NASA report in 2023 concluded that most UAPs are likely attributable to balloons, aircraft, or sunlight reflections, rather than evidence of extraterrestrial life.  Officials at the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), established in 2022 to track UAPs, have stated there is no evidence suggesting that any cases they examined have extraterrestrial origins.

Researcher Jose Luis Velasquez, who inspected the object, noted that it shows no welds or joints, features that would typically indicate human manufacturing. ""It is a very rare piece ... I've never seen a piece like this,"" Velazquez said, according to People magazine. He and his team conducted X-ray scans on the sphere and discovered it consisted of three metal-like layers and contained nine microspheres in its interior.  Velazquez believes that the lack of welds or joints bolsters the theory of the sphere's extraterrestrial origin. He added that the sphere appears to have mysterious symbols carved on its surface. Witnesses reported seeing the orb floating erratically in the sky, zigzagging before crashing near a forest. These observations have led some to conclude that the object could be a UFO.Dr. Julia Mossbridge, a member of the University of San Diego Department of Physics and Biophysics and the founder of the Institute for Love and Time (TILT), expressed skepticism about the sphere's origins. ""It looks so human made to me,"" she told Fox News. Mossbridge suspects the Buga Sphere might be a piece of artwork rather than an object of alien technology.

Post

The High Court has prevented parties from using voluntary deregistration as a loophole to avoid accountability.

The Australian Electoral Commission's refusal to accept the United Australia Party's re-registration for the 2025 election has been unanimously upheld by the High Court.

The party had voluntarily deregistered after the 2022 election, and their re-registration was blocked to prevent the party from avoiding financial transparency rules for party donations.

Section 135(3) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth) says that a party which voluntarily deregistered cannot re-register until after the next federal election, in this case the 2025 election.

Given the looming election, on 12 February, just 5 days after hearing oral arguments, the High Court ruled against the UAP and decided to publish its reasons later. Those oral arguments were covered in this series at the time. The reasons have now been published.

The UAP, represented by Senator Ralph Babet and Clive Palmer, relied on an unlawful burden or limitation on the informed choice of voters and the implied freedom of political communication.

Ironically, while bringing a case based on the ‘informed choice' of voters, the UAP refused to inform the High Court why they de-registered, which several judges called them out for.

Sections 7 and 24 of the Australian Constitution state that Senators and Members must be “directly chosen by the people,” with the “democratic theme of the Constitution” giving rise to the need for a ‘free and informed choice' about the candidates.

Contrasted with that are sections 10 and 31, which allow Parliament to determine all aspects of the electoral process.

The broader implied freedom of political communication limits this power to ensure that voters can engage in the political process and discuss political issues, involving some elements of ‘free speech.' The test for this has been explored in detail in other articles.

Led by the joint judgment of Chief Justice Gageler and Justice Jagot (the remaining judges made individual judgments), the High Court identified several legitimate purposes and upheld the legislation.

The court was also asked to reopen Ruddick v Commonwealth (2022), briefly covered here. There, the AEC gave the Liberal Democrats notice under section 137(1)(ca) that an objection had been raised by the Liberal Party to their registered name.

There, Justices Gordon, Edelman, Steward and Gleeson upheld the provision on a ‘broad' approach that considered it in context, finding that there was no burden on the implied freedom or informed choice, while Chief Justice Kiefel and Justices Keane and Gageler dissented by ruling against it under the ‘narrow' approach of considering just that provision.

Here, all the judges agreed on section 135(3), refused to reopen Ruddick and rejected the implied freedom argument , but the Ruddick split on informed choice was not fully resolved.

The narrow approach

Chief Justice Gageler and Justice Jagot, joined by Justices Gleeson and Beech-Jones, formed the majority.

The joint judgment maintained that the majority in Ruddick was wrong to find that there was no burden on informed choice in that case, and held that there was a “substantial burden” here there was a disadvantage to the voters as the party affiliations of some candidates would be removed. However, there were legitimate purposes for that burden, and the burden was a reasonable one:

Transparency - registered parties have to disclose large political donations and their finances. Without section 135(3), a party could deregister, receive massive non-disclosed donations, and then re-register to spend that money at the next election. Transparency is necessary to keep voters informed.

Avoidance - Under section 136, a party will be deregistered if it does not endorse or nominate a candidate for 4 years. Without section 135(3), voluntary deregistration and then immediate re-registration to ‘reset the clock' defeats the purpose of section 136.

Section 135(3) also prevents parties from deregistering and then reregistering under a similar name to avoid those consequences.

Justice Gleeson, a member of the majority in Ruddick, “readily” accepted a burden on the ‘informed choice' ground. Her Honour agreed with the joint judgment that the “ballot paper can be expected to be an important source of information about party affiliation.”

It was different from Ruddick, because Her Honour argued that similar party names led to confusion for voters. However, despite the burden, section 135(3) was sufficiently narrow in scope to be allowed, especially as it would rarely be relevant

Justice Beech-Jones agreed with the joint judgment about the consequences of ‘obscuring' certain “political viewpoints” by removing some party names and logos, “especially if the law advantaged incumbents.” However, he accepted the above purposes, and added that the deregistration is only limited to one term of Parliament, so isn't disproportionate.

The broad approach

Justices Gordon, Edelman and Steward were members of the majority in Ruddick v Commonwealth, where they held that there was no burden. Here, they maintained their “broad approach” that section 135(3) shouldn't be considered on its own, but as part of the “whole structure” of the legislative scheme, which includes sections 136 and 137.

It should be noted that they recognised the legitimate purposes, but not the narrow approach.

Justice Gordon held that there was a “very slight burden.” The UAP, not the legislation, had affected the informed choice of the voters because the UAP decided to voluntarily de-register. Further, the party's name and logo could still be used “in the parliamentary process, election campaigning and broader political debate.”

Taking a slightly different approach, Justice Edelman said the test was whether the whole “scheme” imposed a burden, and then if that burden changed by removing section 135(3).

Given His Honour's reasoning that there was no burden by the scheme in Ruddick, he identified a “narrow and shallow” burden here.

Justice Steward agreed with Justice Gordon's reasoning, but found no burden whatsoever. His Honour also directly criticised the joint judgment, saying that there is no rule that “the existence of a burden must be measured only from the perspective of the voter.”

The position taken by His Honour and Justice Gordon, which placed the burden on the UAP's actions, was also the Commonwealth's argument.

Although the UAP was unsuccessful, the High Court once again endorsed the implied right to informed choice, separate from the implied freedom of political communication, repeating its stance in Ruddick here.

DULUTH — With Memorial Day behind us, summer has officially landed in Duluth. Time to pitch a tent!

A news release announcing Paranormal Cirque's impending arrival in Duluth calls it ""a very unique show."" That's notwithstanding the fact that when the traveling circus opens its tent flaps here on Friday, May 30, there will also be a Paranormal Cirque II playing in Yakima, Washington; a Paranormal Cirque III in Hanover, Maryland; and a Paranormal Cirque IV in Canada. Look at it this way: The best movies always inspire sequels.

Leo Kottke was born in Georgia, but made his first musical splash in Minnesota. The acoustic guitar wizard emerged on the West Bank music scene in Minneapolis, just a few years after Bob Dylan passed through the neighborhood. Now, Kottke is coming to Dylan's original hometown of Duluth, where he'll play the NorShor Theatre on Wednesday, May 28.

Kottke even had an impact on one of Dylan's most cherished records, ""Blood on the Tracks."" The rhythm section Dylan used while recording songs for that album in Minneapolis — bassist Billy Peterson and drummer Bill Berg — credited their cohesion to what they learned working with Kottke in the very same studio.

Years later, Berg declared that ""Leo Kottke taught us everything we needed to know""

Astrology, tarot cards and seances are not often associated with the pragmatism and sobriety of the Royal Family.

But Princess Diana - in moments of personal crisis - often turned to the spiritual realm for reassurance, cramming her diary with appointments in the late 1980s and 90s.

Andrew Morton wrote in the authorised biography Diana Her True Story: 'When she first began investigating the possibilities of the spiritual world, Diana was very open, almost too open, to belief.

'She was so much at sea in her world that she clutched at any prediction, in the way that a drowning man clutches at flotsam.'

But a former palace official told royal author Sally Bedell Smith that this was a 'cry for help'. 

Diana was first encouraged to speak with a spiritual advisor by Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York.

In 1986, the couple referred Diana, tortured over her failing marriage to Prince Charles and the pressures of royal life, to astrologer Penny Thornton.

'I just wanted to see,' she told Thornton, 'if there is light at the end of the tunnel.'

Andrew Morton wrote: 'When she first began investigating the possibilities of the spiritual world, Diana was very open, almost too open, to belief.' Diana is pictured in Japan in February 1995

Diana began seeing psychic Betty Palko, naturopath Roderick Lane, celebrity psychic Sally Morgan, astrologer Debbie Frank, clairvoyant Vasso Kortesis, medium Rita Rogers and homeopathic dowser healer Jack Temple.

Morton wrote that Prince Charles, who himself is known for his interest in holistic medicine and philosophy, was not supportive of Diana's many spiritual appointments.

He said: 'When Charles saw her reading a book called Facing Death while she was on holiday he asked her bluntly what she was doing wasting her time reading about all those issues.'

Diana became close friends with San Lorenzos restaurant owners Lorenzo and Mara Berni, who Morton wrote 'had a reputation of an Indian earth mother'.

They encouraged Diana's interest in astrology, tarot cards and 'other realms of alternative metaphysics such as clairvoyance and hypnotism'.

It was around this time that Diana was introduced to Debbie Frank who - as Morton wrote - 'combines general counselling and analysis concerning the present and the future as they relate to the conjunction of planets appropriate to Diana's birth time and date'. 

'Born under the sign of Cancer, Diana has many qualities typical of that sign: protective, tenacious, emotionally attuned and nurturing.

'As her confidence in herself grew, Diana started to see these methods of self-analysis and forecast as tools and guides rather than as a lifeline to gab on to.'

As depicted in season six of The Crown, Diana and Dodi visited psychic Rita Rogers - one of the UK's best-known mediums just weeks before they died in the fatal car crash in Paris.

They were put in touch by a mutual friend in 1994, and Rogers did an initial reading over the phone before they met in person.

'You couldn't pull the wool over Diana's eyes,' she said.

'She could spot a fraud from 20 paces, and would have quickly sussed me if I hadn't been genuine.'

Christopher Andersen, author of The King, said: 'Over the years Diana went through a revolving door supply of astrologers, faith healers, numerologists, tarot card readers, clairvoyants, psychics, and 'spiritual advisors.

'Most told her what she already knew: that her husband was cheating on her with his old flame.'

Bodyguard Ken Wharfe agreed. 'Diana was in the thrall of all these mad psychics,' he told Tina Brown in The Diana Chronicles.

At the inquest into Diana's death it was noted that Diana's reliance on spiritual advisors offered companionship and a sense of comfort during a difficult time - but also fueled her paranoia. 

The inquest heard Diana was obsessed with clairvoyants - including one she dubbed 'Fergie's witchwoman', whose identity was not revealed.

Mr Jephson, a former lieutenant commander in the Royal Navy, worked for Diana between 1990 and 1996.

He said he was worried that she put so much faith in astrologers and soothsayers because this 'fed the paranoia that never lurked far beneath the surface'.

By the time of her Panorama interview in 1995, he said, Diana 'saw plots everywhere', even claiming that someone had taken a 'pot-shot' at her with a gun in Hyde Park.

'Needless to say, I had all the accusations checked out, but the threats were, as I had known all along, all in her imagination.'

The psychic bloodline of the royal family can be dated back to the days of Queen Victoria. 

Rogers said: 'You couldn't pull the wool over Diana's eyes. She could spot a fraud from 20 paces, and would have quickly sussed me if I hadn't been genuine'

Occult expert J.H. Brennan claimed that Queen Victoria, who reigned from 1837 to 1901, was 'fascinated by spiritualism' and would invite mediums to Buckingham Palace and hold seances

In his book Whisperers: The Secret History of the Spirit World, occult expert J.H. Brennan claimed that Victoria, who reigned from 1837 to 1901, was 'fascinated by spiritualism' and would invite mediums to Buckingham Palace and hold seances.

Brennan also claimed that Victoria's servant John Brown, whom she was rumoured to have a romantic relationship with, actually acted as a medium to help her channel the spirit of her beloved late husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

Many other members of the Royal Family, such as the Queen Mother, the late Queen and Prince Philip have also reportedly attended seances and other investigations into the paranormal.

In the documentary The King of UFOs, paranormal historian Richard Felix claimed that Queen Elizabeth II attended a seance in 1953 hoping to connect with her then-recently deceased father. 

The queen's mother, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, sister, Princess Margaret, and husband, Prince Philip, were also reportedly in attendance. 

Last year Diana's former butler revealed that the late royal haunts his mansion in Cheshire and that the late Queen also believed in the supernatural.

Paul Burrell, pictured with Diana in 1994, started working in the Princess's royal household in 1987 and was her personal butler until her death in 1997

In his memoir Spare, Harry said that he once sought help from a woman who claimed to have powers to connect with his late mother

Paul Burrell started working in Charles and Diana's royal household in 1987 and was the Princess's personal butler until her death in 1997.

He was having his home inspected by a group of ghost hunters on an episode of Celebrity Help! My House is Haunted when he made the claims.

Prince Harry wrote about exploring the occult to feel connected to his late mother.  

In his memoir Spare he said that he once sought help from a woman who claimed to have powers to connect with his late mother.

'Your mother says that you are living the life that she couldn't live,' Harry recalled the woman telling him. 

'You're living the life she wanted for you.'

It is all speculation now in the GTA community as to whether or not UFOs and alien encounters will ever make it to the soaringly anticipated GTA 6. Rockstar has not commented on the cryptic alien Easter eggs that have entertained the masses in past Rockstar titles. Recent viral hints have led gamers to search for signs of alien activity in Leonida.

Rockstar is one of those developers that likes to drop utterly weird, unexplained things into their games, and aliens are not an uncommon theme. Rockstar has consistently left its player base in awe with its games, from the mysterious UFOs in GTA: San Andreas to the elaborate alien sightings and conspiracy in GTA V and GTA Online. 

That history has conditioned the fans to expect the unexpected, and many believe GTA 6 won't be any different.

The latest spark igniting this fervent speculation is the minutest reference, tucked away unnoticed, in a promotional image and reportedly containing the phrase ‘Alien activity in the area.' This short and mysterious statement has spread like wildfire across Reddit, Discord, and various fan forums. Many are convinced that Rockstar has planted this as the first breadcrumb leading toward alien content in the new game. 

Despite the hype abounding, to this day, Rockstar has not once officially gone on about any alien-themed features. No announcements, trailers, or interviews with a developer have even touched on the subject of UFOs or extraterrestrial encounters. That deliberate silence from Rockstar just lends strength to the rumors, as it is what that rockstar is famous for: letting players find their own secrets and mysteries.

The community takes every frame of leaked gameplay footage and promotional material to start dissecting it for more clues. Whether these turn into concrete gameplay elements or some elaborate Easter egg or a whole storyline, the excitement is palpable.

Some fans imagine the possibilities of alien missions, abductions, and ray guns, which could push the boundaries of what a GTA game has offered so far. Others anticipate a more subtle approach, with cryptic hints scattered throughout the vast open world of Vice City, adding to the game's environmental storytelling.

History with Rockstar suggests that should aliens ever make an appearance, they will certainly be living and breathing entities rather than just static set pieces. In the past, the company has mastered its evolving mysteries, where the community often works with the developer to discover the truth. 

Community puzzles and stories about alien life could very well be the new sauce for GTA 6, providing not just another level of immersion but also replayability. 

Until Rockstar Games makes an official statement, the GTA 6 UFO and alien topic will remain an intriguing mystery, fueling community speculation and fascination with the unknown in Grand Theft Auto lore. One thing is certain: the gaming world is screaming for something out of this world.

GTA 6 alien/UFO speculation has gone so far due to Rockstar's history of weird extraterrestrial-type Easter eggs and recent viral hints of ‘alien activity in the area.' While unconfirmed, the players cannot wait for the possibility of being able to play and learn. Rockstar's silence only builds up the hype that spoils nothing but a fascinating mystery waiting for players in Leonida.

	A trailer for the feature, entitled ""Holiguards,"" was shown in Cannes.


								By 

	Alex Ritman



Kevin Spacey has directed his first feature film in more than 20 years. 


Variety understands that the two-time Oscar winning actor — who fell from grace in Hollywood following multiple accusations of sexual misconduct — has directed a supernatural action-thriller in which he stars alongside Dolph Lundgren (“Rocky IV,” The Expendables”), Tyrese Gibson (the “Fast & Furious” franchise, “Morbius”), Brianna Hildebrand (“Deadpool,” “Lucifer”), Disha Patani (“Kalki 2898 AD,” “Bharat”) and Eric Roberts (“Runaway Train,” “The Righteous Gemstones”).

	The indie film, which has the working title of “Holiguards,” is planned to be the first in a franchise known as “Statiguards vs. Holiguards” and also stars Harry Goodwins (“The Gentlemen”), Swen Temmel (“The Clean Up Crew”) and Sonia Pim Couling (“Operation Bloodhunt”). It also marks the first feature to be produced by Elledgy Media, owned by Portugal-based Ukrainian entrepreneur Elvira Gavrilova Paterson.


	As per the description, “Holiguards” is set against the backdrop of a near-future world fractured by hidden supernatural forces, where two ancient warrior factions — the Holiguards and the Statiguards — wage a secret war for control of humanity's fate. Amid this conflict, a young woman discovers that she's the daughter of two rival leaders and could end the conflict. Meanwhile, a Statiguard strategist prepares a catastrophic attack in Paris using a nuclear device and an army of mind-controlled civilians, channeling energy from a cosmic portal to awaken an ancient force known as the Prime. 


	The film, which has a budget of around $10 million, shot in Mexico last year and is now in post-production. Elledgy Media Group produces “Holiguards” alongside Lado Film. Producers include Paterson, Vadim Vadim Degtyarev and Vitaly Kucherov. The script was written by Sergey Torchilin and Lado Okhotnikov. Variety hears a trailer was being screened to potential interested parties at this year's Cannes Film Festival. 


	It was actually in Cannes where Spacey made his boldest return to the limelight since his career nosedived in the wake of the MeToo scandal, and since he was found not guilty of multiple allegations of sexual misconduct in a high-profile court trial in 2023. The actor — whose last trip to the south of France during the festival was in 2016 — hit the carpet at several events, most notably the amfAR gala dinner and also the Better World Fund gala, where he was given a lifetime achievement award and, in a fiery 10-minute speech, took aim at his own blacklisting from Hollywood, declaring that it was “nice to be back.”

	











	“Holiguards” wasn't the only film of Spacey's in Cannes. The actor was also in town to help promote the British indie “The Awakening,” a conspiracy action-thriller in which he appears as the head of sinister global cabal that controls the world, which was selling in the market.

Local fiction: Megan Giddings' “Meet Me at the Crossroads” is about a family and two sisters who make wildly different choices.

By Chris Hewitt

In her “Meet Me at the Crossroads” Megan Giddings thanks people you'd expect a writer to acknowledge, including readers and University of Minnesota English department colleagues V.V. Ganeshananthan and Julie Schumacher. There's also at least one you might not expect: an Uber driver.

That driver, who drove the creative writing and literature professor to a New Orleans bar, claimed to be a psychic. She told Giddings personal things that left her shaken.

The psychic also gave Giddings the ending of “Crossroads,” a speculative fiction novel about twins who are faced with the appearance of a mysterious door near their Michigan home (Giddings' editor compares it to Carl Sagan's bestselling “Contact”). Olivia passes through the door and possibly into another world. The other twin, Ayanna, spends years struggling with the disappearance of her sister.

Giddings, 40, and husband Jon Cameron live in Minneapolis. We chatted about her third novel (the others are “Lakewood,” one of New York magazine's 10 best books of 2020, and “The Women Could Fly”). We began with that crazy car ride:

Q: No spoilers but the book ends with a scene in which Ayanna's ride-share driver conveys a key message to her. That happened in real life?

A: Yes. In New Orleans, this woman started telling me things, some a little vague and some uncomfortably like what was going on in my life at the time. She was a nurse and apparently a psychic — this is the most New Orleans thing I can think of — and she kept saying that someone had a message for me, someone from the other side. It was so unnerving.

Q: You knew right away you were going to use it?

A: I still have no idea how to interpret what went down but I realized, “This is the next book.” There's only one other moment in my fiction that is drawn so directly from real life. But I knew, “This is something I'm going to use.” It happened in 2021 and I was just finishing up “The Women Could Fly.”

Q: You grabbed a notebook and started writing stuff down?

A: I posted about it on social media. I immediately told people at dinner about it. The other thing is my husband was in the Uber, too, and he was like, “What the [expletive]?” I was saying, “That really happened, didn't it? I didn't have some complete break from reality?” And he said, “Yeah, that was the craziest Uber ride I've ever had in my life.” It's also the only Uber ride where the driver hugged me. I was crying. It was an emotional situation.

Q: Did you give a good tip?

No Section

No Section

No Section

A: Oh, 25% tip. Five stars. “Thank you for finishing my future book. Thank you for making me feel weird for three days.”

Q: What did you want to accomplish with “Crossroads”?

A: I knew for a long time I wanted to write about two things. A number of my friends were having kids and were really worried about, “How do I teach my kid to be a good person? How do I give them a foundation of caring about other people?” Even my own roots — I was raised strictly Catholic and I have really mixed feelings about having faith now but I can see that there's where I learned even to want to care about other people, which is one thing I'm really grateful for.

Q: You said there were two things?

A: I was interested in writing about my fear of death and the unknown. I thought by the time I was 35 or 40 I would feel less lost, or the world would make more sense, but I think it's gotten even more inexplicable.

Q: The idea of being a good person really comes through. I counted 79 uses of the word “kindness” in the book.

A: It's been interesting to see it called a coming-of-age novel. I have some hesitations around that but if it's a coming-of-age novel about learning to be kind in an unkind world, and that's part of the progress to being an adult, that would make me really happy.

Q: That's probably even trickier for young people who are, like you, Black. The sisters in the book are Black, too, and its treatment of race feels very subtle. Can you speak about that?

A: I get a lot of pleasure out of them but a lot of the books that get published seem to be catered to the idea that the primary concern of being a Black person is being a Black person in a country that doesn't want Black people. They are important and necessary — I get sent so many books that are Black horror or speculative fiction that deal with repercussions of race. They're often very good. But I felt like there's not always room for fun or kindness or thinking deeply about living a long life.

Q: And we should say it is a really funny book. What was the hardest part to get right?

A: The ending. And, also, all of it.

Q: Say more about that, please.

A: A lot of books, especially around death or kindness themes, can be scolding. I felt like the book should feel comfortable, like you're being invited in to think about all of these things, so there were times I had to work really hard not to scold. I changed a lot of my diction to feel more informal and I tried to emphasize play, have jokes.

Q: You've said the writing of your books often overlaps. Did that happen here?

A: Very slowly. I'm doing research and writing very poorly. But it is nice to be thinking about the next one.

Q: And now you know that if you get stuck, all you have to do is go to New Orleans and hop in an Uber?

A: I'll email and let you know if she ever gives me a new book.

The story, centering on a man who can predict murders, has 'The Gentlemen' producer Ivan Atkinson on board for a feature adaptation.


							By 

	Aaron Couch


Film Editor


	The Kick-Ass team is getting back together, with prolific comic book scribe Mark Millar and artist John Romita Jr. reteaming for the new comic book Psychic Sam.


	The book launches on Kickstarter today, and centers on a man who knows about murders before they happen, with a voice in his head telling him the name and address of future killers.




	“It's about a guy with a big gun who goes out and solves problems. He hears voices in his head that tell him to kill bad guys,” Millar says in a video announcing the comic. “The only trouble is, the bad guys haven't done anything yet. But every time he ignores it, someone innocent dies. It's only a matter of time before the bodies pile up.”

	Millar and Romita struck gold 15 years ago with Kick-Ass, the comic that centered on a regular teenager who decided to become a vigilante, despite having no powers and no special skills. The zeitgeisty book spawned the hit 2010 movie that helped establish Mathew Vaughn as an in-demand director in the comic book space.


	Now, the pair hope to repeat the success, with producer Ivan Atkinson coming aboard to develop Psychic Sam as a feature. Atkinson is known for his work with Guy Ritchie, producing films such as The Gentlemen and Wrath of Man. If the movie comes to fruition, it'd be the latest in a string of Millar titles to hit the big screen, with Wanted and Kingsman also on the list. Meanwhile, his genre-breaking 2000s work at Marvel on The Ultimates and Civil War helped inspire the Marvel Cinematic Universe.


Psychic Sam is noteworthy for Millar, as it does not fall under Netflix, where he has been exclusive since 2017, when the streaming giant purchased his company Millarworld in a splashy deal that brought titles to the screen such as Jupiter's Legacy and The Chosen One. Millar says Psychic Sam will not affect his output at the Netflix-owned Millarworld, with books still slated through 2026. 


	Millar says the desire to do Psychic Sam came after receiving offers from Marvel to do a big summer event series, ala Civil War, as well as from DC, to take on a big Superman project. Instead, he carved out 12 weeks at the end of last year to write the project.


	With the Kickstarter now live, Millar and Romita are offering a number of incentives, including the chance to be drawn into the book. Said Romita in the video announcing the project: “I have to do justice to all of you.”

The injured were still lying in the road when conspiracy theories started circulating online.

Not even an hour had passed after a driver rammed his car into Liverpool fans celebrating their club winning the Premier League, when prolific users of X, formerly Twitter, took to the site to speculate on the motive and identity of the driver.

At 6.55pm, less than an hour after the incident occurred Tommy Robinson, a far-Right activist, wrongly described it as a “suspected terror attack,” despite Merseyside Police making no such mention in their statement.

An hour later, Ant Middleton, former Special Forces soldier and Reform UK supporter, pushed the theory further, writing: “When you have leaders normalising terrorist attacks by saying that they're part and parcel of big city living, you open yourself up to these types of national threats!”

Undoubtedly mindful of the disorder in Southport last summer, by 8pm Merseyside Police announced they had arrested a 53-year-old white British man.

Conspiracy theorists' posts had frightening echoes of the hours after Axel Rudakabana's murdering of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport last July.

Reporting restrictions had prevented Rudakubana, then aged 17, from being named. The lack of information about the suspect's identity saw riots engulf the seaside town after rumours spread he was a Muslim asylum seeker.

This time the force poured cold water on rumours, releasing the suspect's details just two hours after the incident. By 10.30pm they'd held a press conference with further details, saying at 10.56pm, undoubtedly mindful of the disorder last summer, that it was not being treated as a terror attack.

That should have put conspiracy theories to bed. But sceptics have raised questions over videos which show a young man driving what appears to be the offending vehicle despite the man arrested being aged 53.

Writing on X, James Goddard said: “Media announce driver is a 53-year-old White British male but in the footage the driver looks in his early 30's not 50's

“No doubt the authorities are working overtime to piece a dishonest narrative together to feed the public.”

Numerous anonymous accounts on X began questioning whether this was a media and government plan to keep the truth from the public.

People began speculating whether it was a false-flag attack, while others continued to insist that a man seen lying on the ground wrestling with police officers was in fact the driver of the car.

As more details about the alleged attach emerged late on Tuesday, including the fact he was arrested on suspicion of being high on drugs at the time, the conspiracy theorists seized upon one detail still missing from reports: a name.

The fact that there was no name was to many, on social media at least, proof that something was being hidden from them.

“Until the name of the man is made public, don't believe anything”, one X user posted.

The reality is that police never name a suspect until they are charged.

Merseyside Police said on Tuesday, during a second press conference, that they had been granted an extension to question the suspect until Wednesday lunchtime.

At that point they will either have to release the man on bail, or make a charging decision.

Whether even that will stop the manic, unfounded speculation that now seems to inevitably follow mass-casualty incidents such as Southport and Liverpool, remains unknown.","{'href': 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}","other"

Fans of true-crime shows have undoubtedly come to learn that Netflix features a treasure trove of programming that will satisfy the urge to learn more about some of the most infamous murder cases in history. Their newest hit, Cold Case: The Tylenol Murders, was released yesterday and is already skyrocketing up the charts, taking the #2 slot right behind their dark comedy series Sirens. It's no surprise, really, as the three-part docuseries traces one of the biggest unsolved cases in U.S. history. 

Directed by Yotam Guendelman and Ari Pines, Cole Case: The Tylenol Murders takes an in-depth look at one of America's largest criminal investigations that changed the way pharmaceuticals were distributed. Taking place in the early 80s in Chicago, the case began when several people died from cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules. This led to widespread panic about public health as authorities raced to find a culprit, with the biggest suspect being James William Lewis, who was never charged and died in 2023 at the age of 76. 

Let us be your personal Netflix curators so you can find the kind of shows you'll wish lasted twice as long but can't wait to start over, once again!

While no one was ever caught, the case changed the way that Tylenol and other drugs were forever packaged and distributed. No longer was it as simple as opening up the bottle and shaking a couple of capsules into your hand. Johnson & Johnson introduced tamper-resistant packaging to include induction seals and child-proof caps, and stricter quality control methods were also put in place in factories across the country.

Cold Case: The Tylenol Murders joins another recently-released true-crime documentary in the Top 10 list of TV shows on Netflix, as Fred and Rose West: A British Horror Story still sits in the #8 slot after being released on May 14, 2025. Like The Tylenol Murders, it also stretches across three episodes, and tells the tale of two of the UK's most prolific murderers.

The popularity of these two shows highlights the fact that the true-crime genre as a whole shows no signs of slowing down any time soon. It seems that as soon as a docuseries is released, it immediately climbs the charts as fans flock to get their fix. HBO Max is another great streaming service that offers a lot of content by way of Investigation Discovery, including their newest series, Sherri Papini: Caught In the Lie.

True-crime fans will recall the Papini case being everywhere in 2016 after the young wife and mother disappeared in broad daylight. Appearing three weeks later, she infamously lied to the FBI about being kidnapped, and was later sentenced to 18 months in prison. The case was previously examined last year in the three-part Hulu docuseries Perfect Wife: The Mysterious Disappearance of Sherri Papini.

Needless to say, there's no shortage of true-crime mysteries out there to consume, with Cold Case: The Tylenol Murders being just the latest in a string of shows this year that have been all the talk around the social media water cooler. You can check out the three-part docuseries streaming now on Netflix, but be warned: if you have a headache, it might make you think twice about taking a couple of Tylenol.

Researchers have found fresh evidence that Africa is breaking apart because of a deep mantle superplume of hot rock beneath the East African Rift System.

Researchers have found new evidence that a gigantic superplume of hot rock is rising beneath Africa, causing intense volcanic activity and splitting the continent in two.

Geologists have long known that Africa is slowly breaking apart in a region called the East African Rift System (EARS), but the driving force behind this massive geological process was up for debate. Now, a new study has presented geochemical evidence that a previously theorized superplume is pressing up against — and fracturing — the African crust.

Scientists found that gases at the Meengai geothermal field in central Kenya have a chemical signature that comes from deep inside Earth's mantle, likely from between the bottom of the mantle and the core. The signature matches those of gases found in volcanic rocks to the north, in the Red Sea, and to the south, in Malawi, indicating all of these places are sitting on the same deep mantle rock, according to a statement from the University of Glasgow in Scotland.

""The deep mantle signatures observed in different segments of EARS are remarkably similar, suggesting that they all originate from a common deep source,"" study first-author Biying Chen, a postdoctoral research associate in the School of Geosciences at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, told Live Science in an email.

The researchers published their findings May 12 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

EARS is the largest active continental rift system on Earth, ripping through around 2,175 miles (3,500 kilometers) of Africa. The lithosphere, Earth's rocky outer shell of crust and upper mantle, has been gradually breaking apart across the rift for around 35 million years. This has left a network of valleys that carve through the top of the continent from the Red Sea off northeastern Africa to Mozambique in southern Africa.

Previous studies identified signs of a deep mantle plume beneath EARS in noble gas signatures. Noble gases, such as helium and neon, are rare and inert, which means they usually don't chemically react with other substances. As a result, they stick around for a long time, so researchers can use them to trace long-term geological processes. However, Chen noted that these geochemical tracers have been sparse and often controversial beneath EARS.

To help clarify what's going on beneath EARS, the team used high-precision instruments to look for neon (Ne) isotopes in Kenyan gases — and they detected a deep mantle signature. The signature in the gases is very similar to those of the most primordial (ancient) surface signatures in Hawaii, which is also thought to be sitting on a deep mantle plume.

""We were very excited to see the preliminary Ne isotope data showing the primordial deep mantle signature,"" Chen said. ""But the deep mantle signature is small and we had to work hard to disentangle it — truthfully there was no Eureka moment, we frequently questioned the result and spent many hours checking and re-checking the data.""

Once the team had rigorously assessed the data, they became confident that the signature was genuine and matched signatures found in other parts of the rift. Chen noted that the EARS plume likely originates from the core-mantle boundary, about 1,800 miles (2,900 km) deep inside the Earth.

While the EARS signatures are similar to those found in volcanic rocks on Hawaii, Chen noted that the Hawaii plume is proposed to be a discrete rising stream of hot mantle, a bit like a lava lamp, while the EARS plume is probably a different shape.

""More likely a large mass of upwelling of hot buoyant material from deep within the Earth has replaced the mantle that was originally beneath the EARS,"" Chen said. ""As it has risen and meets the solid colder lithosphere it spreads out generating enough force to fracture the thin lithosphere, leading to intense volcanic activity in the region.""

Lord Abbett & Co. was dealt a more than $60 million blow on a commercial mortgage-backed security tied to an office campus in suburban Kansas City, after the underlying loan was sold at a steep discount.

The money manager owned the vast majority of the $233 million CMBS, which was backed by the mortgage on the Aspiria office campus, formerly the headquarters of telecom giant Sprint Corp. The riskiest portion of the securitization, with a face value of more than $65 million, was wiped out earlier this month after the loan's sale left just $164 million to distribute to creditors, according to the latest monthly remittance report.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Germany would consider supporting a suspension of EU funding to Slovakia and Hungary if the countries continue to oppose the bloc's sanctions policy against Russia, Chancellor Friedrich Merz has warned.

Bratislava and Budapest have also taken a critical stance towards Western policies regarding the Ukraine conflict. On Monday, the German chancellor lifted Kiev's restrictions on firing long-range German weapons deep inside Russia, a move the Kremlin has described as a “serious escalation.”

Referring to Hungary and Slovakia, Merz warned that EU member states violating the rule of law could face infringement proceedings, adding that “withdrawing European funds is always an option…If it is necessary, then we will deal with it.”

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban have repeatedly criticized EU leaders and argued that the West's military and financial backing of Kiev only prolonged the conflict, without yielding any progress. Fico survived an assassination attempt in May 2024, when he was shot at close range by a pro-Ukraine activist.

”We will not be able to avoid this conflict with Hungary and Slovakia if we continue on this course,” Merz said. “We cannot allow the decisions of the entire EU to depend on a small minority. And there could certainly be clearer words and possibly also harder conflicts.”

Fico rejected Germany's threat to cut funding, calling it unacceptable and a breach of the bloc's democratic values.

”If someone wants to push a policy where only one opinion is allowed, that's the end of democracy in Europe,” Fico told reporters on Tuesday during a visit to Armenia.

Slovakia took what Fico calls a “constructive” and pragmatic approach towards Russia since he came to power in 2023. Under his leadership, Bratislava has cut military assistance to Kiev and pledged to veto any new EU sanctions that could harm Slovakia's economy. Fico has visited Moscow twice since December to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, drawing criticism from both the EU and NATO.

“Europe needs Russia, and Russia needs Europe,” he said in a video message last week, reflecting on his visit to Moscow earlier this month.

Ukraine's allies have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia and its supporters over the full-scale war, but experts say there's room for more

U.S. President Donald Trump may follow the EU after all and impose more sanctions on Russia, already the world's most sanctioned country, days after saying he wouldn't. Ukraine's allies have imposed sanctions on Russia, as well as thousands of individuals and entities both in the country and around the world for aiding Moscow's full-scale invasion. But there is still room for more sanctions to be introduced, experts told the Kyiv Independent. While Russia's economy hasn't crashed and burned as some expected, the three years of sanctions are eroding the country's fiscal stability, despite Moscow claiming otherwise. Russian GDP growth has dropped precipitously this year as sanctions hamper its main sources of income — oil and gas revenue — and curb imports of components needed for its military-industrial complex. Sanctions on their own won't end the war, but they are a crucial tool in the West's efforts to pressure Putin to the negotiation table. Washington's seesawing on its sanctions strategy has alarmed Brussels, but Europe and others remain united on the effort. “All the other partners that we've been talking to, including Switzerland, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea, all think that Russia should be stopped with the help of the sanctions, and they're ready to do it,” Ukraine's sanctions chief Vladyslav Vlasiuk told the Kyiv Independent. 

“The EU has a lot of leverage in not just maintaining the sanctions pressure, but even increasing sanctions pressure,” he said.

Trump initially rejected joining the EU in further sanctioning Moscow for fear of derailing future trade and business opportunities with Russia, the New York Times reported on May 20. The previous week, Brussels said it was gearing up for a massive sanctions package after Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to attend peace talks in Istanbul on May 15.Russia's colossal three-day drone and missile campaign on May 23-26 appeared to change Trump's mind. Speaking to reporters on May 25, he said he was considering sanctions after Putin had “gone absolutely crazy.”

Western sanctions have impeded Russia's energy, financial, and military sectors, even if they haven't stopped the war. Russia still has loopholes to get around sanctions, such as importing prohibited goods through Central Asia, but they are generally costly and time-consuming. Ukraine and its allies have three key objectives when it comes to sanctions, according to Vlasiuk. To deny Russian state revenues, reduce its military capabilities, and undermine Putin's regime. The first two have yielded substantial results, with Russia losing $150 billion in oil revenues in three years due to energy sanctions and its military sector facing shortages in critical components, said Vlasiuk. The third hasn't been successful as Putin still has widespread support from the Russian public, and that doesn't look set to change, Vlasiuk added.This year, Russia's economy has started to contract for the first time since the start of the full-scale invasion in the first quarter of the year, shrinking by 0.4% compared to the previous quarter. In the same period, Russia's gross domestic product (GDP) growth saw a precipitous drop from 4.5% to just 1.4%.  While it's hard to paint a fully accurate picture of Russia's economy, due to the Kremlin restricting and manipulating data, Sussex University economics professor Richard Disney estimates that Russia's economy is around 10% below what it would have been if it hadn't invaded Ukraine. ""There's a shortage of workforce, there's the depletion of bank reserves, there's the collapse of certain investments. Foreign investment has dried up in Russia,"" Disney told the Kyiv Independent. 


“The West is not willing to impose the sort of sanctions on Russia that would indeed be 'massive' because those sanctions would inevitably have a blowback on European economies and this would be weaponized by nationalist politicians.” 
    

“Russia has gone from being close to a first-world country to heading in the direction of the third world,” he added. Moscow has batted away claims that sanctions are impacting Russia, pointing to its economic growth over the last three years. In reality, it has divested spending from things like education and infrastructure towards the military. This distorts actual GDP figures, and consumer spending and public investments have likely dropped by 15-20% compared to pre-war estimates, leaving Russians much poorer in reality, said Disney. Western policymakers, particularly in Europe, have fed into Moscow's propaganda by bigging up the impact of sanctions while holding back full force, said Tom Keatinge, director of the Center for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a think tank. Instead, policymakers need to “manage expectations” on sanctions, he said. The sanctions have also been imposed gradually over the three years instead of all at once, due to political hesitations and concerns about disruptions to global markets. While this gives governments time to fully prepare for the consequences of the sanctions, it means they are less effective.“The West is not willing to impose the sort of sanctions on Russia that would indeed be 'massive' because those sanctions would inevitably have a blowback on European economies and this would be weaponized by nationalist politicians,” Keatinge said.  “The result is that Russia can adapt, shape-shift, and continue to gather the income and resources it needs to conduct its illegal war in Ukraine.”

Sanctions on Russia's energy sector have often been criticized for being too loose, as Moscow exploits loopholes to export oil and gas and skirt the $60 oil price cap set by the West. Still, Russia's fossil fuel sector continues to hemorrhage profits, and Europe has largely banned Russian energy, although it continues to import Russian liquid natural gas (LNG). Russia earned around 242 billion euros ($275 billion) from fossil fuels last year, a 3% drop from 2023, according to the Helsinki-based Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). Sweeping sanctions at the start of the year helped tie up loose ends and targeted Russia's opaque and uninsured shadow fleet, which carried 61% of its seaborne oil exports in 2024. Once a vessel is sanctioned, ports will refuse to allow it to dock. In turn, Russia must spend more money finding new vessels to expand the fleet, piling up the costs and running down the profits. ""Selling oil through tankers is a lot more expensive than selling it through a pipeline,” said Disney. Alongside energy sanctions, the West also went after Russia's financial institutions at the start of the full-scale invasion. Most Russian banks, including its Central Bank, are barred from the Western financial world and cannot be used for trade or capital operations. In 2022, Europe kicked major Russian banks off the SWIFT interbanking system, which pushed Moscow towards the Chinese banking system. But Chinese banks began limiting Russian transactions from December 2023 after Washington threatened to cut dollar access to institutions supporting Russia's military suppliers. 

In November 2024, Washington imposed even more sanctions on 50 Russian banks, making transactions between China and Russia even more arduous. Moscow has repeatedly tried to lift financial sanctions and restore access to SWIFT, like in March, when it demanded a ceasefire in the Black Sea in return, which ultimately failed to materialize. The West also froze some $300 billion in Russian Central Bank (CBR) assets at the start of the invasion, equating to around half of its foreign currency reserves. While there has been a hot debate about whether to mobilize these assets for Ukraine, simply taking so much money out of Russia's reach was one of the most impactful sanctions, said Keatinge. “Of course, this has been undermined by the Kremlin's ability to continue to raise foreign income via the sale of oil, so the effectiveness of the CBR asset freeze is reduced every day a Russian tanker is able to deliver oil,” he added. In terms of tangible impact on the battlefield, Vlasiuk points towards the coalition of countries that prevents critical weapons components from entering Russia, known as the Common High Priority (CHP) item list. It covers everything from microelectronics to CNC machines and extends beyond Western nations to include countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan. “It imposes extra export controls over certain categories of products from the CHP list. And that makes it much more difficult for Russia to get those items imported,” Vlasiuk said. Imports of these components are still flowing into Russia via third countries, largely in Asia. It is just harder to get them and more costly, leaving the Russian arms sector scrambling to find alternatives.

Amid Washington's oscillating policy, EU sanctions chief David O'Sullivan warned of disunity on the sanctions front, German media Suddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) reported on May 27. Although even if the U.S. doesn't end up imposing new sanctions, its current ones should remain in place, Vlasiuk said. Fortunately for Ukraine, the EU is much more definitive on its sanctions policy. Brussels believes they are working and threatened “massive” sanctions if Russia rejects ceasefire proposals, which Moscow has so far. “We are continuing to work on a new package of sanctions, precisely because that seems to be the only language that is understood by President Putin,” European Commission Chief Spokesperson Paula Pinho told the Kyiv Independent. The 18th package will be ready “as soon as possible,” Anita Hipper, European Commission Foreign Affairs Spokesperson, said at a press briefing on May 22. It could take time, however, to get signed off by the EU's problem child, Hungary, which has slowed down previous sanction efforts. Details on the package have not yet been announced. But Hipper said the now destroyed Nord Stream pipelines connecting Europe and Russia would be included, likely to prevent their resurrection, as well as shadow fleet vessels, and crude oil. 

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on May 16 that Russia's banking sector would also be included, with potentially 20 more banks disconnected from SWIFT. The EU may also propose lowering the oil price cap from $60 to $45 to further hit Russia's energy sector. Some are sceptical that the EU will actually deliver the blow that is really needed. “The problem is that Europe has continuously overpromised and under-delivered,” said Keatinge. If Brussels is serious, then sanctions really need to tighten up the loopholes, said Vlasiuk. This means not just lowering the oil price cap but also sanctioning shadow fleet captains, prohibiting all maritime services for Russian oil exports, and a total ban on Russian LNG imports to Europe, which hit record levels last year, he said. Europe should also continue to disconnect the remaining Russian banks from SWIFT, Vlasiuk said. Russia uses cryptocurrencies and third countries' financial systems to circumvent sanctions, and these should be cracked down on too, he added. There are also raw material imports that Europe could go after to stop them from getting to Russia's military sector. Ukraine has identified materials such as titanium, antimony, beryllium, lithium, and carbon fiber as potential targets. “The Russian military defense sector is also very dependent not just on the microelectronics and cutting-edge technologies but also on selected raw materials and critical minerals,” Vlasiuk said. “Sanctions work and we just need more,” he added.Alex Cadier contributed reporting to this story.

The executive chair of InterRent Real Estate Investment Trust IIP-UN-T, Mike McGahan, is offering to acquire the apartment owner for $2-billion with the backing of Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC. 

On Tuesday, Ottawa-based InterRent announced CLV Group, a private company owned by Mr. McGahan, and GIC are bidding $13.55 per unit for InterRent, which owns more than 12,000 apartment units in three provinces. Mr. McGahan is the REIT's former chief executive officer. 

The offer to take InterRent private comes after the REIT faced an activist campaign from Toronto-based asset manager Anson Funds, which built a 9-per-cent stake in the company. The takeover bid is priced at a 35-per-cent premium to the price of InterRent units on March 7, when media first reported on Anson's campaign. 

InterRent said the takeover offer is worth $4-billion, including the REIT's debt. InterRent is widely held, with Mr. McGahan owning 4 per cent of units. 

Anson pushed for a sale or restructuring of InterRent because its units were trading well under their net asset value, which analysts pegged at approximately $16 per unit.

A special committee of InterRent's board members hired National Bank Financial (NBF) to do a valuation of the REIT. On Tuesday, InterRent said NBF estimated the fair value of the company is between $12.75 and $14 per unit. 

InterRent's board has set up a 40-day “go-shop” period to allow the REIT to solicit a better offer. The Globe and Mail previously reported a number of real estate companies approached InterRent with potential takeover offers. The go-shop process ends on July 6. 

“While we are pleased to see the InterRent Board take a concrete step towards closing its valuation discount, we will see how the go-shop process unfolds as we believe there is potential for more value to be realized,” said a spokesperson for Anson in an e-mail. 

“We are pleased to provide immediate and certain premium value to our unitholders through this all-cash transaction with CLV Group and GIC, while also allowing InterRent to solicit superior proposals through a go-shop period of 40 days,” said Brad Cutsey, InterRent's CEO, in a press release.

“We are delighted to partner together with GIC on this transformative transaction,” said Mr. McGahan in a press release. 

InterRent will pay the buyers a $49-million fee if the transaction is terminated during the go-shop period, and a $79-million fee if the purchase is shut down after July 6. 

CLV Group and GIC will pay the REIT $89-million in a reverse break fee if their offer is terminated. The transaction is expected to close by early 2026. 

Mr. McGahan is CEO of CLV Group, which served as property manager for InterRent until 2018. He previously served as CEO of the REIT for 12 years, and was the Ottawa Business Journal's CEO of the Year in 2023. 

GIC is one of the world's largest fund managers, with approximately US$800-billion of assets under management. 

BMO Capital Markets and National Bank Financial are advising InterRent on the transaction, with law firm Norton Rose Fulbright Canada LLP advising the REIT's special committee and Gowling WLG (Canada) LLP working for InterRent.

Bank of Nova Scotia is advising the buyers, while law firm Goodmans LLP is working for CLV Group and Stikeman Elliott LLP is in GIC's corner. In addition, law firms LaBarge Weinstein LLP and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP are advising the two buyers on their joint venture.

The road to El Zonte was, quite literally, paved by Bitcoin.

Just a few years ago, surfers sniffing out the region's world-class waves would have to drag their boards down dirt roads to reach this stretch of tropical shoreline.

But after Nayib Bukele, the self-described “world's coolest dictator”, announced in 2021 that El Salvador would become the first country to make Bitcoin a legal tender, this small seaside town of 3,000 people was transformed.

The region had already been branded “Bitcoin Beach” – ground zero of the country's cryptocurrency experiment – but Mr Bukele's controversial crypto-policies turned what had been a trickle of interest into a tsunami.

Roads were quickly laid to welcome the influx of crypto-enthusiasts descending on their decentralised fiscal mecca, with almost every sign lining the streets boasting some form of Bitcoin reference.

The letter “B” no longer exists in El Zonte – all over the town it has been usurped by the Bitcoin symbol – and everyone from the owners of tamale stands to street vendors selling jewellery are happy to accept it.

Hotels, restaurants, apartment complexes have all cropped up – with construction sites on every corner as builders struggle to keep up with demand.

But Mr Bukele's Bitcoin bubble now appears to have burst.

The populist Salvadorian leader, who has fashioned himself a Silicon Valley-style disrupter, signed a $1.4 billion-deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the bogeyman of Bitcoiners, in which he agreed to scale back the country's Bitcoin policies.

As part of the agreement, Salvadorian merchants are no longer compelled to accept the cryptocurrency as payment and Mr Bukele agreed on paper to stop buying Bitcoin with public cash – the country currently owns more than 6,000 Bitcoin – although he has since said their strategy is not stopping.

So what will this gear-change mean for “Bitcoin Beach”?

“It's gonna keep some people away, definitely,” says Ronny Avendano, who runs the Bitcoin Hardware Store, which sells all the Bitcoin bells and whistles including tech and books about the cryptocurrency.

“The IMF is definitely a governing body that you want to stay as far away from as possible... It might be detrimental to the business,” he adds.

While he does not think the IMF deal will impact life in El Zonte, where Bitcoin is already enmeshed in the community, he worries it could cause some Bitcoiners to get “cold feet”.

Mr Avendano, whose parents fled El Salvador for Canada during the civil war, gave up his six-figure job in finance in Toronto to travel Latin America in response to Justin Trudeau's vaccine mandates. His first stop was El Zonte in March 2021. He has been here ever since.

After learning about Bitcoin, he became a “Bitcoin maximalist”, investing all of his savings in the cryptocurrency. Right now, he says, he only has around $9.

When Mr Bukele announced Bitcoin would be a legal tender, he saw an “influx” of Bitcoiners from all over the world arrive.

Talking to The Telegraph after giving a short lesson on investing in the courtyard outside his shop, he adds: “From a tourist perspective, you know, I don't feel that excitement anymore... It used to be ‘I can't wait to come to El Salvador' to now ‘tell you what's going on with this deal'.”

He adds: “For me, nothing's changed. People in town still accept Bitcoin, and I still love the Bitcoin farmers market. Yesterday, I went to buy food at the grocery store in Bitcoin.

“I don't know what's gonna happen over the next six months if it were to change... I'd have to close my business down.”

Mr Avendano believes it's not just Bitcoin pulling foreigners to El Salvador, but the country's safety.

To combat gang violence, Mr Bukele enforced a “state of exception” in 2022, rounding up and imprisoning more than 80,000 people without due process. The streets are safer, but the Bukele administration has faced allegations of human rights abuses.

His administration also built the notorious Cecot mega-prison, where Donald Trump has since deported Venezuelan migrants the White House claims are gang members.

Walter Mena, a Salvadorian lawyer, was reluctant to open a business before Mr Bukele, when even El Zonte was overrun by gangs and it was not uncommon for people to be shot dead on the beach.

But now Mr Mena, 49, who returned to El Salvador in 2019 after living in France for 15 years, is in the midst of constructing apartments he hopes to rent to wealthy Bitcoiners

Mr Mena, who accepts Bitcoin payment for his legal services, does not think the IMF deal will make any difference.

“Now people know what Bitcoin is and how to use it... Bukele is pretty smart, and the IMF is full of dinosaurs,” he said.

“People probably will turn back, but the people who understand, who are already here, they're not leaving.”

For locals in El Zonte, the sudden arrival of foreign Bitcoiners has been a blessing and a curse. Wealthy foreigners have been investing in the area, buying land, building homes and starting businesses.

But prices have increased, and for each tale of one local making enough money to buy a new motorcycle with Bitcoin, there are stories of those who lost thousands in the volatile market.

Surf teacher Isaac Reyes, 28, who is from El Zonte, says there have been more positive impacts than negative on the local community. He is sometimes paid in Bitcoin but he and most of the locals transfer it straight into dollars using an app on their phone.

He said he believes the novelty of Bitcoin Beach had already reached its “peak” and is now “going back down”.

“Now the difference is the people, not the currency… less people are coming,” he said.

From speaking to the Europeans who have already moved to El Salvador in search of Bitcoin freedom, there is no hesitation – they are here to stay.

M moved to El Salvador from London in 2021 after he broke up with his girlfriend and read about Mr Bukele.

Talking to The Telegraph as he sips on a can of beer with a friend, purchased with Bitcoin, he says he did not know El Salvador existed before he read about the Salvadorian president.

M, 28, who did not want to give his full name, now lives in San Salvador. He first bought Bitcoin almost a decade ago when he was at university and now works for a hardware Bitcoin devices firm.

Asked what he likes most about the country, he said: “The fact that I can just easily use my Bitcoin everywhere.”

Danny, a retired Belgian housebuilder who also did not want to give his last name, made his fortune in Bitcoin before moving to El Zonte 20 months ago in search of a crypto haven to retire to.

You wouldn't know it by looking at him, as he sits on a stool wearing a vest and flip flops, but Danny, 59, is a Bitcoin millionaire.

He invested his life savings in 2014, when one Bitcoin was worth around $311. The value has since swelled to over $108,000.

He believes Europe is becoming a “police state” and part of the reason he has relocated to El Zonte is to provide a base for his nine grandchildren to escape to if they wish.

El Salvador, by contrast, he says is like the Wild West. “There are not many rules, or not many rules that you really need to follow... there is almost no control.”

James Bosworth, the founder of Hxagon, a firm which provides political risk analysis with a focus on Latin America, is also unconvinced the IMF deal will have much of an impact.

He puts the apparent dwindling numbers of people visiting Bitcoin Beach down to the town losing its sheen, rather than the IMF deal.

“It's probably more a function of the initial hype cycle about El Salvador's Bitcoin drawing down and global macro factors (likely recession hits all tourism),” he says.

He adds: “There are only so many people who might relocate and most of them jumped early. For anyone still considering it, the IMF agreement didn't change much.”

Dr Peter Howson, an assistant professor at Northumbria University who has written books on cryptocurrency, thinks Mr Bukele's Bitcoin experiment has been a “failure”.

In 2023, eight out of 10 Salvadorians did not use cryptocurrency, according to a survey by the University Institute of Public Opinion (Iudop) at the José Simeón Cañas Central American University (UCA).

Meanwhile, only a fraction of remittances sent back to El Salvador from relatives abroad, which accounts for 25 per cent of the country's GDP, were sent with Bitcoin.

“It might be popular with tourists that have come for the novelty of being able to do something useful with their Bitcoin, but other than that it was a failure,” Dr Howson says.

He adds: “I think just because there's this IMF deal in place, I think there's still going to be some fondness for Bitcoin and silly policies down the road.

“I don't think this is the end of the line for Bitcoin in El Salvador, by any means.”

Doctors have kept Adriana Smith on breathing machines for three months due to the state's “heartbeat law.”

A 30-year-old Black woman in Georgia has been kept on life support for three months against her family's wishes because of the state's “fetal heartbeat” anti-abortion law. Adriana Smith was declared legally dead in February after a medical emergency caused her brain function to cease. Smith, a nurse, had been initially turned away when she first sought medical care. She was nine weeks pregnant at the time. But because her medical providers would face legal consequences including jail time if they were to end the pregnancy, Smith's body is still being kept on breathing machines despite the fact that Smith herself can no longer be resuscitated. The case demonstrates once again that “it is deadly to be Black and pregnant,” says Monica Simpson of the reproductive justice organization SisterSong.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.

We turn now to Georgia, where there's growing concern about the plight of a pregnant woman who's been declared brain dead but has kept on life support for three months against the wishes of her distraught family because of Georgia's abortion ban. Adriana Smith is a 30-year-old mother and nurse who suffered a medical emergency in February due to blood clots in the brain, was declared legally dead. At that point, she was about nine weeks pregnant. She's now about 22 weeks pregnant, but doctors have kept her on breathing machines because her fetus was old enough to have detectable cardiac activity. Georgia's “heartbeat law” bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected.

This comes as Georgia's attorney general has said Georgia's heartbeat bill does not require medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death, and issued a terse statement that, quote, “Removing life support is not an action ‘with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy.'”

Georgia's maternal and infant mortality rates are among the worst in the country, with Black women dying at twice the rate of white women.

We're joined now by two guests. In Washington, D.C., Mini Timmaraju is with us, president of Reproductive Freedom for All, formerly NARAL Pro-Choice America. And in Atlanta, we're joined by Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong, the national women of color reproductive justice collective that's based in Georgia, has a lawsuit against Georgia, arguing its six-week abortion ban is denying people in Georgia lifesaving care.

We welcome you both back to Democracy Now! Monica Simpson, let's begin with you. Can you talk about the situation right now, what the family wants for their beloved, brain-dead loved one who is pregnant and who doctors are keeping on life support?

MONICA SIMPSON: Thank you so much for having me.

It is a dire situation that we're dealing with here in Georgia. And we are constantly having to navigate this system that keeps showing us over and over again that it is deadly to be Black and pregnant in this state, where access to care is so far out of reach for so many people, and the limitations and the criminalization that we are constantly navigating now with this abortion ban is something that Georgians did not want, and it's something that we are constantly doing all that we can to push back against.

Adriana deserved to be here. What we know about her story is that she did what she knew what to do as a nurse. When she found out and she could feel in her own body that something was wrong, she went to the doctor. She went to get the care that she needed, and she was sent home. Now, if the doctors would have been — did everything they could, maybe we would have been able to get a different outcome for Adriana. But, unfortunately, that's not what happened, because, unfortunately, that's not what happens for so many Black women in this country. They are not trusted when they are going into their doctor's offices. They're not trusted when they are saying that there's something wrong with their bodies. They're not trusted when they are saying that they need access to care. And, unfortunately, that's what happened to Adriana.

And so, now her family is battling such a hard time. They should be able to grieve. They should be able to take care of themselves and all of the family members who are having to deal with this ordeal. But, unfortunately, they're having to navigate so many unanswered questions. They're having to navigate something they shouldn't have to, which is an abortion ban that's connected to this issue, that should not even be at play at this particular moment.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And in Georgia, we're talking about one of the states that has among the worst maternal and infant mortality rates in the country, particularly for African American women and children. Could you talk about that?

MONICA SIMPSON: Absolutely. We are dealing in Georgia with maternal health deserts, right? Over half of our counties do not have access to an OB-GYN, so care is out of reach for so many. We are also a state that has yet to expand Medicaid, and we know, federally, we are still fighting for Medicaid to be something that Americans have access to, which means that there are thousands of people upon thousands of people who are falling in the cracks every single day, not having access to basic healthcare needs. So, when you add that to a state that has now put a six-week abortion ban in place, it makes it a very, very harsh environment for folks to be able to get access to what they need in terms of their reproductive healthcare.

AMY GOODMAN: I mean, it is amazing. Georgia's Attorney General Chris Carr released a statement declaring that the six-week abortion ban doesn't require medical professionals to keep women alive on life support after they've been declared brain dead, Monica.

MONICA SIMPSON: What I find very interesting about the times that we are in is that this abortion ban has created so many obstacles for people. There has been too many people who have tried to figure out what it means, when it means that, and that is the problem that we're dealing with here. It is not cut and dry. It is not black and white. It is something that we're having to constantly navigate over and over again.

At the end of last year, we lost two more Black women because of what this abortion ban put in place for them in terms of a barrier. We lost Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, right? These are two Black women who were also pregnant in our state that wanted to terminate a pregnancy and came up against the very real barriers that this abortion ban puts in place for folks.

And so, what is happening constantly, as we are getting these stories, as we're understanding what the landscape is really looking like for people in Georgia because this abortion ban is in place, is that it is not a cut and dry — we're not getting cut-and-dry answers here. We are dealing with folks who are in real time having to navigate too many questions, whenever it should be that we should have access to the real-time healthcare that we need in order for us to be able to thrive and to live our most healthy lives in Georgia. And that is not the case with this abortion ban that is currently in place.
