                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>William Duplessie, accompanied by his lawyers, surrendered to the NYPD's Major Case Squad detectives. The victim, an Italian citizen and another business associate of the two men, was reportedly held captive inside a townhome for over two weeks. When the 28-year-old refused, police said Woeltz and the other person pistol-whipped the victim, held a gun to his head, used a chainsaw on his leg, urinated on him, tied his wrists, dangled him out of a building and threatened his family in various attempts to get him to comply. The victim finally escaped captivity on Friday morning, more than two weeks after first being taken captive. He immediately went to police, who arrested Woeltz the same day. A gun and several torture implements consistent with the man's allegations were also found within. Officials say that Woeltz is a big-name cryptocurrency trader from Kentucky with an estimated net worth of around $100 million. Authorities did not say what part of Kentucky Woeltz is from. Woeltz is facing multiple charges, including kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, and assault.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The online gambling marketer's raise was led by blockchain technology firm Consensys, with participation from Galaxy Digital, ParaFi Capital, Ondo, and Pantera Capital, among other investors, SharpLink Gaming said Tuesday in a statement. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) The newly raised funds will go toward acquiring Ethereum, which will serve as the company's primary treasury asset—a move that emulates the playbook of Michael Saylor's software company, Strategy, which has amassed $64 billion worth of Bitcoin since 2020 and inspired a growing list of crypto-stashing followers. SharpLink Gaming's private equity deal is expected to close on May 29. “This is a significant milestone in SharpLink's journey and marks an expansion beyond our core business. On closing, we look forward to working with Consensys and welcoming Joseph to the Board,” said Rob Phythian, founder and CEO of SharpLink, in a statement. SharpLink Gaming shares are trading at $35 as of writing time, soaring 420% in the past day. SharpLink Gaming did not disclose how much Ethereum it aims to acquire. Medical device company Semler Scientific and Japanese investment firm Metaplanet began employing aggressive Bitcoin-based strategies in 2024, for example, with many other firms similarly following the Strategy model. Meanwhile, Upexi and DeFi Development Corp. (formerly Janover) have raised millions of dollars for acquiring Solana for their respective corporate treasuries over the past few months, and Canadian firm Spirit is gunning to become the “Strategy of Dogecoin.” The announcement comes after a recent surge in Ethereum's price following months of declines, with ETH even falling as Bitcoin continued to push to new highs earlier this year. Ethereum has faced an identity crisis amid other concerns from developers and community members, with the Ethereum Foundation recently undergoing leadership changes as a result.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (ETH) is up 4% on Tuesday following Sharplink Gaming's plan to raise $425 million in a private placement, led by Consensys, to purchase ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset. The firm announced it has entered a private investment in public equity (PIPE) agreement for the issuance and sale of 69.1 million of its shares to investors. The sale is expected to generate proceeds of $425 million, which Sharplink intends to use in purchasing Ether as part of its new treasury strategy. "On close, Consensys looks forward to partnering with SharpLink to explore and develop an Ethereum Treasury Strategy and to work with them in their core business as a strategic advisor," said Lubin in the press release. Notably, Sharplink is not the first company to adopt an Ethereum treasury plan. Healthcare firm BioNexus Gene Lab (BGLC) announced in March that it would be adding ETH as its treasury asset. The development comes as more corporate firms are veering towards a digital asset treasury strategy, particularly for Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL). These tokens have seen increased institutional exposure in the past few months, with companies like Strategy and DeFi Development Corp consistently purchasing BTC and SOL, thereby boosting their market demand. As a result, both tokens largely outperformed ETH in the past year. However, ETH's status quo could be set for a boost with Sharplink's $425 million buying pressure. The company prioritizes developing tools that promote the application of Ethereum in financial markets, with a focus on tokenization and secure asset trading. Ethereum experienced $68.43 million in futures liquidations over the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass data. If ETH can sustain a high-volume bullish move to flip $2,850 into a support level, it could rally to test the symmetrical triangle's upper boundary. A decline below this level could bring the support range between $2,250 and $2,100 into focus. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram bars are above their neutral levels, indicating dominant bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) has slightly tilted into its overbought region, signaling rising chances of a short-term pullback.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week at Bitcoin 2025, Square is piloting real-time bitcoin payments, letting attendees scan and spend crypto for T-shirts, hoodies, and hats at the BTC Inc. pop-up store. Behind it all is Miles Suter, a longtime product leader at Block, who flew in early to oversee setup with his team. Suter joined the company in 2017, when Cash App's bitcoin integration was still a hackweek experiment. Eight years later, he's helping "connect the Blocks" — working across Cash App, Spiral, Bitkey, and Square to embed bitcoin into every layer of the company's ecosystem. The Square rollout, he says, is a natural next step. At the same time, stablecoin legislation is advancing in Congress, and more fintech giants are aligning behind tokenized dollars. Block is taking a different path — one that centers on bitcoin. Asked about the lingering perception that bitcoin is better suited for holding than spending, Suter pointed to a familiar pattern. When Cash App first introduced bitcoin trading, he said, it was met with hesitation and doubt. "But again, somebody's got to be first," he said. He called the new Square rollout "a really significant milestone" in Block's broader mission to make bitcoin more accessible and usable. The product builds on Square's "Bitcoin Conversions" tool, launched last year, which lets merchants automatically convert a portion of their daily sales into bitcoin. Block says it has rolled out the feature to more than 1,000 sellers so far — and those who opted in have seen their bitcoin holdings grow by roughly 70% over the past year. This latest feature goes a step further, enabling sellers to accept bitcoin directly at the point of sale. For businesses that don't want to hold bitcoin, there's no exposure risk. "If you just want to have it as another payment method — like Amex, MasterCard, or Visa — bitcoin is now potentially another option for you," Suter said. For those that do want to hold it, Block is building out what Suter calls a "Bitcoin for Business" stack — a full suite of tools to accept, convert, manage, and self-custody bitcoin. That means being able to convert your daily sales, buy and sell from your U.S. dollar balance into bitcoin, and withdraw to self-custody at any time. It's about giving our merchants more options and making sure they never miss a sale." The announcement comes amid renewed attention on corporate bitcoin strategy, as some publicly traded firms adopt the cryptocurrency as a treasury reserve asset. But Block is targeting a different segment of the market. "There's a lot of talk about corporate bitcoin right now," Suter said. "But like we did on Cash App — which is very much about the little guy and bringing accessibility to everyone — we want small and medium-sized merchants to also be able to get the benefits of bitcoin." While Block hasn't released specific metrics yet, Suter said merchants who participated in the Bitcoin Conversions pilot have all profited. "Every single seller is in the money and has made money based on converting a certain percentage of their daily sales," he said. Square's bitcoin push joins a broader ecosystem at Block that includes Bitkey, its self-custody wallet; Proto, a line of bitcoin mining hardware and software; Spiral, its open-source development arm; and Cash App's bitcoin trading functionality. "We're focused on making bitcoin everyday currency," Suter said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Circle, the issuer of USDC, has filed for an IPO with hopes of a $5.65 billion valuation, aiming to boost institutional trust through transparency and U.S. regulatory compliance. To evolve beyond a stablecoin issuer, Circle launched the Circle Payments Network (CPN) to support cross-border payments and diversify its business as it navigates regulatory uncertainty. Last week, it was the news Thursday (May 22) that J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup are exploring the launch of a jointly operated stablecoin. Circle is betting that the credibility conferred by becoming a public company will help the company in a financial environment skeptical of opaque crypto firms. Transparency is a key pillar of Circle's pitch to institutional clients as outlined in its S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. By going public, Circle will subject itself to the scrutiny of U.S. securities laws, quarterly earnings reports and regulatory disclosures, all elements designed to engender trust from risk-averse enterprises, banks and governments. Elements such as programmable money services, secure identity layers, robust compliance automation and user-friendly APIs could be crucial since institutional trust is hard-won and easily lost. See also: Keeping Stablecoins Stable is Complicated: Why CFOs Need to Pay Attention Circle must now contend with legacy finance and FinTech upstarts. PayPal launched PYUSD, and traditional banking consortia are mulling their own. But whether that will be enough to ward off better capitalized or more broadly distributed competitors is uncertain. The potential IPO valuation and capital war chest may help, but only if Circle is able to move quickly to entrench itself as the preferred partner for enterprises. Circle's S-1 offers insight into its revenue model, revealing an interest-sensitive business. That figure underscores how tightly Circle's fortunes could be tied to interest rate policy. As a practical matter, Circle earns this income by parking USDC reserves in short-term U.S. Treasury securities and overnight reverse repurchase agreements. The downside is that if interest rates fall, so too does Circle's revenue. Additionally, stablecoin market capitalization reached an all-time high amid strong performance across crypto sectors in April. The SEC, for example, said it is eying regulatory changes to accommodate on-chain securities and other crypto assets. Still, the GENIUS Act could include a provision prohibiting interest-bearing stablecoins. Designed to facilitate the use of stablecoins for mainstream cross-border payments, the network and coordination protocol enables financial institutions to exchange payment instructions and settle transactions on open, public blockchains. Early adopters of CPN include Alfred Pay, which is using the network to enable stablecoin-to-fiat offramps via PIX and SPEI; Tazapay, which is using it to support compliant fiat disbursements into Hong Kong; RedotPay, which is using the network to initiate USDC-based payments into Brazil; and Conduit, which is using it to onramp fiat into USDC in the U.S. and Europe to support B2B flows into Mexico. We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum ETH$2,673.58 has staged an impressive recovery in the past 24 hours, climbing 3.8% amid significant market volatility. The second-largest cryptocurrency found solid support at $2,530, where exceptional trading volume (242,521 ETH) created a clear bottoming pattern. This was followed by a decisive breakout during the early trading hours, supported by massive volume surges exceeding 550,000 ETH that pushed prices above key resistance levels. The recent price action confirms a short-term trend reversal, with ETH now trading above $2,575 after establishing new local highs. Institutional interest remains robust, with spot Ethereum ETFs recording $248 million in total net inflows over the past week, suggesting growing confidence from larger investors despite relatively subdued retail participation. Market analysts point to the $2,800 level as a critical resistance zone where many investors who previously bought at that level may look to exit at break-even. However, with ETH breaking out of its recent consolidation pattern and the broader crypto market showing signs of strength, bulls are now targeting the $2,650-$2,745 range as the next significant hurdle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As part of its 24 million-share IPO, Circle will be offering 9.6 million shares of Class A common stock, while selling stockholders will offer the remaining 14.4 million shares. Circle, the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, has launched an initial public offering (IPO) of 24 million shares of its Class A common stock, the company said on May 27. As part of the offering, Circle is issuing 9.6 million shares of Class A common stock, the company said in a news release. The remaining 14.4 million shares of Class A common stock will be offered by selling stockholders. The IPO involves participation from several major US investment banks, with JPMorgan, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs acting as joint lead active bookrunners, the announcement added. The offering will also feature European banks, including Barclays, Deutsche Bank Securities and Societe Generale acting as bookrunners. Circle currently expects to offer IPO shares at a price ranging from $24 to $26 per share, potentially raising between $576 million and $624 million. In its Form S-1 filing on Tuesday, Circle said it will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of Class A common stock by the selling stockholders. Crypto-focused investors like Cathie Wood's ARK Invest have indicated an interest in purchasing up to $150 million of IPO shares, Circle noted in the filing, adding: “For Circle, becoming a publicly traded corporation on the New York Stock Exchange is a continuation of our desire to operate with the greatest transparency and accountability possible,” Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire wrote in a letter accompanying the Form S-1. “Operating as a US-listed public company represents our continued dedication to transparency and accountability, as we will become subject to the reporting, corporate governance, and other requirements,” he added. At the time of writing, USDC has a market cap of $61.5 billion, while its main competitor, USDT, has a $152.7 billion market cap, according to CoinGecko. Though a significantly bigger player than Circle, El Salvador-based Tether is apparently not looking to launch an IPO.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following its successful mainnet launch and Mobius Hackathon, where they received over 250 unique project submissions – Sonic has attracted a diverse set of innovative protocols leveraging its high-performance infrastructure to build next-generation Web3 applications. “The rapid development of our ecosystem demonstrates the versatility and performance advantages of Sonic SVM,” said Chris Zhu, CEO and co-founder at Sonic. “These projects represent the beginning of a vibrant, interconnected ecosystem that's building critical infrastructure across DeFi, NFTs, and social applications.” “SEGA is built to capitalize on Sonic's superior performance, allowing us to create trading experiences that weren't possible on other chains,” said a SEGA representative. Chaos Finance has launched the first liquid staking protocol designed specifically for Sonic SVM, enabling users to participate in network security while maintaining liquidity. Built on StaFi LSaaS technology, Chaos offers seamless staking with deep DeFi integrations. Now, there are over 765k+ SONIC staked through chaos, and 754k+ sSONIC circulating in the market. FoMoney, the fully onchain game has teamed up with Chaos, and integrated sSONIC as an in-game currency. “Liquid staking is critical infrastructure for any blockchain ecosystem,” noted a Chaos Finance representative. “Our protocol allows users to simultaneously secure the network and participate in DeFi opportunities, maximizing capital efficiency while supporting Sonic's decentralization.” Originally launched as Sonic SVM's first meme token launchpad, Goodr is evolving into the world's first UGC IP token platform for anime fans. The platform will enable fans to mint tokens inspired by official anime content through partnerships with Japanese IP holders. This innovative technology allows users to seamlessly convert between NFTs and fungible tokens, solving liquidity challenges while preserving digital collectibles' unique identity and rarity. “By allowing seamless conversion between NFTs and tokens, we're creating a new asset class that combines the best of both worlds.” Since launching on Sonic testnet, FoMoney have onboarded 1 million+ on-chain players and created 200+ millions transactions. These flagship projects form the foundation of a rapidly expanding ecosystem on Sonic SVM. With complementary functionalities spanning trading, staking, meme culture, and digital collectibles, they demonstrate the versatility of Sonic's infrastructure for supporting diverse Web3 applications. “What's particularly exciting is how these projects are already beginning to integrate with each other,” added Freiheit, Head of DeFi from Sonic. Sonic SVM is the first chain extension SVM to launch on Solana – developing a groundbreaking blockchain protocol that serves as a programmable attention settlement layer. Built on the HSSN network, it offers consensus-level validation of attention-related transactions, granular on-chain access to user activity across dApps, and composable primitives that eliminate the need for each project to build bespoke attention infrastructure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sati, a Bitcoin payments app and Lightning infrastructure provider, today announced the launch of its Lightning integration with Xverse, a Bitcoin wallet used by over 1.5 million people worldwide. Initially designed in 2017, the Lightning Network has grown to become Bitcoin's leading layer-2, with a current BTC capacity of over $465M. Sati is now leveraging this technology to bring the world's favorite digital currency into the pockets of almost 3 billion users worldwide, thanks to its powerful API integration with WhatsApp. “Bitcoin was not meant to be an asset for Wall Street—it was built for peer-to-peer money, borderless and accessible,” said Felipe Servin, Founder and CEO of Sati. “Integrating Lightning natively into Xverse brings that vision back to life, making Bitcoin usable at scale for billions.” Thanks to the integration, every Xverse user now gets a Lightning Address instantly. That means they can receive tips, pay invoices, and use Bitcoin for microtransactions—all without having to manage channels or switch between different apps. By leveraging its API-based solution, the company provides plug-and-play backend services to wallets and platforms looking to add Bitcoin payments without compromising on security or UX. The Xverse launch follows the debut of Parasite Pool, a new mining pool leveraging Sati and Xverse's tech stack and focused on democratizing Bitcoin mining. Parasite Pool charges 0% fees and pays out instantly over Lightning, making it ideal for small-scale miners, especially those running ultra-low-power hardware like Bitaxe. Sati recently closed a $600K pre-seed round backed by Bitcoin-focused investors, including Draper Associates, BitcoinFi, Arcanum, BoostVC, and Ricardo Salinas. Sati will be conducting live product demos at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on May 27-29. Launched in 2025 with investors of the likes as Draper Associates and Ricardo Salinas, Sati powers fast, seamless Bitcoin payments on applications such as WhatsApp to fuel the next wave of adoption. Trusted by over 1.5 million users, Xverse is launching a unified portfolio platform for Bitcoin L1 and Layer 2s, alongside developer infrastructure to power seamless Bitcoin-native apps.

Monadverse, a whimsical NFT ecosystem on the Monad blockchain, reports record-breaking testnet stats with over 3.2 million MON traded and 1.08 million NFTs minted, signaling a vibrant future for Web3 users as Chapter 10 looms. On May 26, 2025, Monadverse reported a total combined volume of over 3.2 million MON tokens traded and more than 1.08 million NFTs minted during its Story Testnet phase. Additionally, 240,000 Chapter 9 Soulbound NFTs were airdropped to participants, marking a significant milestone for the platform. These figures, accompanied by a vibrant collage of Monanimal characters, highlight Monadverse's growing appeal among NFT collectors and Web3 enthusiasts. Chapter 9, titled “Guardians in the Cave,” is the latest installment in Monadverse's Story Testnet, a narrative-driven campaign designed to engage users through gamified NFT minting and trading. Chapter 9 introduced Soulbound NFTs, non-transferable assets that ensure authenticity and prevent identity spoofing among participants. Unlike the tradable NFTs from Chapters 1 through 8, which are listed on Magic Eden, these Soulbound NFTs are locked to users' wallets, symbolizing their commitment to the Monadverse ecosystem.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares in Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) tumbled Tuesday as the company behind President Donald Trump's Truth Social app said it is planning to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin. Trump Media stock is down 8% in intraday trading Tuesday and has lost almost a quarter of its value so far this year entering Tuesday. Trump Media said it would sell around $1.5 billion in shares and $1 billion in zero-coupon convertible bonds to approximately 50 institutional investors in a private placement. “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets," Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said. The $2.5 billion offering is expected to close on Thursday, the company said, and will "place Bitcoin on Trump Media's balance sheet alongside existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaling $759.0 million as of the end of the first quarter of 2025." The Financial Times earlier Tuesday reported the plan by Trump Media to sell stock and convertible bonds to buy bitcoin. Business intelligence and bitcoin treasury company Strategy (MSTR), formerly known as MicroStrategy, has acquired billions of dollars in the digital currency in the past year by selling stock and convertible bonds. Strategy shares are up almost 30% so far this year entering Tuesday. UPDATE—May 27, 2025: This article has been updated to include the confirmation by Trump Media of its plan to raise funds to buy bitcoin. “Trump Media Announces Approximately $2.5 Billion Bitcoin Treasury Deal.”</p>

SharpLink Gaming (NASDAQ:SBET) has announced a significant $425 million private placement through a PIPE offering, selling approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 per share ($6.72 for management). Upon the offering's closing, expected around May 29, 2025, Joseph Lubin, Ethereum Co-Founder and Consensys CEO, will become SharpLink's Chairman of the Board. The private placement is being conducted under Securities Act exemptions, with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners serving as the sole placement agent. La collocazione privata viene effettuata in base alle esenzioni previste dal Securities Act, con A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners come unico agente di collocamento. La compañía planea utilizar los fondos para adquirir Ethereum (ETH) como su principal activo de reserva en tesorería. La colocación privada se realiza bajo exenciones de la Ley de Valores, con A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners como único agente colocador. 회사는 조달 자금을 주요 재무 준비 자산으로 이더리움(ETH)을 매입하는 데 사용할 계획입니다. 2025년 5월 29일경로 예상되는 이번 발행 마감 시 Joseph Lubin 이더리움 공동 창립자이자 Consensys CEO가 SharpLink 이사회 의장으로 취임할 예정입니다. 이번 사모 발행은 증권법 예외 조항에 따라 진행되며, A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners가 단독 배정 대행사로 활동합니다. Le placement privé est réalisé sous les exemptions de la Securities Act, avec A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners en tant qu'agent unique de placement. SharpLink Gaming (NASDAQ:SBET) hat eine bedeutende Private Placement in Höhe von 425 Millionen US-Dollar im Rahmen eines PIPE-Angebots angekündigt und verkauft etwa 69,1 Millionen Aktien zu je 6,15 US-Dollar (für das Management 6,72 US-Dollar). Das Unternehmen plant, die Erlöse zur Anschaffung von Ethereum (ETH) als Hauptreservevermögen der Treasury zu verwenden. Nach dem voraussichtlichen Abschluss des Angebots um den 29. Die Privatplatzierung erfolgt unter Ausnahmen des Securities Act, wobei A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners als alleiniger Platzierungsagent fungiert. SharpLink's $425M fundraise to adopt Ethereum as treasury reserve represents a significant strategic pivot with major crypto industry backing. SharpLink Gaming's announcement of a $425 million private placement represents a dramatic strategic shift for this online performance-based marketing company. The company is effectively implementing a Bitcoin-style treasury strategy but with Ethereum instead, positioning ETH as its "primary treasury reserve asset." What makes this particularly notable is the investment consortium. The round is led by Consensys Software (founded by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin) and includes participation from nearly every major cryptocurrency venture capital firm including ParaFi, Electric Capital, Pantera, Galaxy Digital and others. The $6.15 per share pricing ($6.72 for management) represents a specific valuation decision point that the crypto investment community has deemed appropriate. This treasury strategy essentially transforms SharpLink into a publicly-traded vehicle with significant Ethereum exposure. While the company states it will continue its core business serving sports betting and iGaming industries, this move effectively creates a new investment thesis for the stock as an Ethereum proxy on public markets - similar to how MicroStrategy has become a Bitcoin proxy. The distinction is that SharpLink appears to have attracted significant backing from Ethereum ecosystem insiders, suggesting possible additional strategic developments beyond simply holding ETH in treasury. SharpLink continues its online performance-based marketing company serving the U.S. sports betting and global iGaming industries MINNEAPOLIS, May  27, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SharpLink Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:SBET) (the "Company" or "SharpLink") today announced that it has entered into securities purchase agreements for a private investment in public equity (PIPE) for the purchase and sale of 69,100,313 shares of common stock (or common stock equivalents in lieu thereof) at a price of $6.15 per share ($6.72 per share for certain members of the Company's management team), for expected aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $425,000,000, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. ETH will serve as the Company's primary treasury reserve asset. “This is a significant milestone in SharpLink's journey and marks an expansion beyond our core business. On closing, we look forward to working with Consensys and welcoming Joseph to the Board,” said Rob Phythian, Founder and CEO of SharpLink.

Turning his attention to the payments platform Stellar (XLM), Martinez says that it could witness a correction after moving below a diagonal support. “XLM could be breaking out of an ascending channel, potentially targeting $0.26!” XLM is trading for $0.28 at time of writing, a 1.5% decrease on the day. TON is trading for $3.00 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day. Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.
