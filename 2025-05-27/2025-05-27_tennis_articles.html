                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sonay Kartal made quick work of Erika Andreeva on Tuesday at Roland Garros, cruising to a 6-0, 6-2 win in just over an hour. She also had a tattoo appointment to reschedule. ‚ÄúI actually had one booked tomorrow at 11,‚Äù she said with a grin, when asked how she might celebrate. My sister just texted me and she's changed [the appointment] to 4. Kartal, a 23-year-old from Great Britain, revealed it would be her 14th tattoo, finally breaking past a number she wasn't exactly eager to sit on. ‚ÄúSo I'm happy to get it off No. Yeah, I've been stuck on that one. I haven't been able to get it. As for what the new ink will be, she's leaving that decision to her sister. ‚ÄúNot actually sure what I'm going to get,‚Äù Kartal said. Kartal, currently the 56th-ranked player, didn't rule out marking the occasion more specifically once her tournament run is done. And if you're wondering how she balances tattoo pain with professional tennis? ‚ÄúHonestly, the niggles I carry on the court every day are much more painful than that,‚Äù Kartal said. ‚ÄúSomewhere on my arm is not too sore. ‚ÄúNo, it's nothing like a tennis niggle.‚Äù</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Joao Fonseca made a sparkling Roland Garros debut on Tuesday when he ousted the in-form Hubert Hurkacz 6-2, 6-4, 6-2. He left the 30th-seed Hurkacz searching for answers, overpowering him from the baseline and matching that heavy hitting with watertight consistency. Hurkacz was a finalist at last week's ATP 250 event in Geneva, where he fell to Novak Djokovic in a three-hour, five-minute final. Fonseca now boasts an 11-7 tour-level season record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. At the Australian Open, he earned a memorable first main-draw win at a major by stunning ninth seed Andrey Rublev. Fonseca won his maiden tour-level title the following month in Buenos Aires. 57 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, Fonseca will next face French veteran Pierre-Hugues Herbert, 16 years his senior. In other Paris action, Jack Draper's clay-court evolution continued when he overcame a tricky start to notch his maiden match win at Roland Garros.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iga Swiatek is searching for a fourth consecutive French Open title at this year's event. The Polish star hasn't had the best of starts to her 2025 campaign, and traveled to Paris having failed to win any of the eight WTA tournaments she's played. Swiatek beat Rebecca Sramkova in her opener, 6-3, 6-3, to send her through to the second round in convincing fashion. ‚ÄúWhen I compare it to Wimbledon, for example, at Wimbledon I always feel this tension that I am not sure what is going to happen, but here at Roland Garros it feels like home. ‚ÄúI just hope that I am going to play well enough to stay here as long as possible.‚Äù ‚ÄúRebecca [Sramkova] played much better than in Australia, so for sure she worked on some stuff and changed some stuff. Just as she did in Melbourne, Swiatek will return to take on Emma Raducanu after beating Sramkova. Only time will tell who will come out on top in their fifth career meeting when Swiatek and Raducanu battle it out for a place in the third round on Wednesday, May 28. Swiatek mentioned how she feels ‚Äòtension' when playing at Wimbledon, but how has she fared on the grass during her career to date? The world number five came closest to victory in 2023, when she lost to Ukraine's Elina Svitolina in the quarterfinals. Her results at Roland Garros are far more impressive, winning the tournament on four of her six visits to the French capital. It's perhaps no surprise that the French Open has been Swiatek's most successful Grand Slam event, as she continues to produce her best tennis on the clay. It remains to be seen if Swiatek can improve upon her underwhelming Wimbledon record when the tournament begins on Monday, June 30.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>8 ranking, British tennis stalwart Cameron Norrie remains a prominent figure in the sport. While his ranking has seen recent shifts, Norrie's journey reflects his resilience as he continues to compete on the Grand Slam stage. Tennis Head has everything you need to know about this accomplished player. She is an American who works as a textile designer and has her own homeware and fashion accessory shop called Studio Virgo. Cameron Norrie and Louise Jacobi have been together for around four years. The couple were introduced by mutual friends at a New York City bar in 2019. 8 in the ATP singles ranking in September 2022, he has since moved down the rankings to his current position of No. His rise to the top 10 was a result of consistent performances, including his first ATP title win in Los Cabos in 2021, followed by a victory at the Indian Wells Masters later that year. While Norrie remains a formidable player, recent results have not consistently matched his peak level from 2021 and 2022, leading to the current drop in his ranking. Across his appearances, he holds a 7-7 win-loss record at the Australian Open. His performance in the earlier rounds has varied, but the 2024 run marked his deepest journey in this Grand Slam. French Open: Roland Garros has seen Norrie reach the third round on three occasions: in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Wimbledon: His most successful Grand Slam tournament is Wimbledon, where he achieved his best major result by reaching the semi-final in 2022. US Open: At Flushing Meadows, Norrie's best performance was reaching the fourth round in 2022. His overall win-loss record at the US Open is 9 wins and 7 losses, although he did not take part in 2024. Norrie was born in 1995 in Johannesburg, South Africa, to British microbiologist parents: his father, David, is from Glasgow and his mother, Helen, is from Cardiff. In 1998, when Norrie was three, he and his family moved to Auckland, New Zealand, after being victims of a burglary in South Africa. His parents lived in New Zealand until 2023 when they moved back to the United Kingdom. In June 2017, he ended his studies at TCU to turn professional during the grass court season of the 2017 ATP Tour. Norrie is 29 years old and was born on August 23, 1995. He began playing tennis at the age of six, with his mother introducing him to the sport, and he supposedly started playing in the driveway of their family home in New Zealand. Norrie's estimated net worth is around ¬£4.43 million as of July 2024, mainly built through his tennis career. His total prize money earnings exceed ¬£8.75 million (as of January 2025). Beyond on-court earnings, lucrative endorsements greatly contribute to his wealth. He has partnered with the likes of Babolat, Rado, Maui Jim and Lexus UK. Other endorsements include Ralph Lauren, Uber, Athletic Brewing, Waterdrop, PGIM, and Illuvium.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ROLAND GARROS, PARIS ‚Äî He's a young Italian tennis player, but not Jannik Sinner or Lorenzo Musetti. He's an up-and-coming On athlete, but not Ben Shelton or Joao Fonseca. And he's so softly spoken, that at times it's impossible to hear him without leaning in close. Flavio Cobolli, an understated but self-assured 23-year-old Italian, has flown under the radar during his fledgling tennis career. That is now much harder, because he just won the biggest title of his career. Before the French Open, Cobolli beat former world No. 5 Andrey Rublev in straight sets to claim the Hamburg Open in Germany, an ATP 500 event, a couple of rungs below the Grand Slams. Cobolli said he felt ‚Äúa little bit confused‚Äù in an interview at Roland Garros on Sunday as he explained the feeling of winning a big title and then heading straight to another one, trophy in hand. ‚ÄúI like it,‚Äù he said of the attention before a first-round match against lucky loser and 2014 U.S. Open champion Marin ƒåiliƒá. It was deflating after his breakthrough season in 2024, which saw his ranking rise from outside the world's top 100 to the top 30. Going back to last year, Cobolli partly credits his progress to doing pre-season training in Spain with an old friend, Carlos Alcaraz. During an interview at the Laver Cup in September, Cobolli proudly referenced that junior victory, and said of their training block together at the Ferrero Tennis Academy in Alicante that he ‚Äúlearned a lot from Alcaraz and his lifestyle.‚Äù Still, Alcaraz has been impressed by what he's seen from his near-contemporary. ‚ÄúHe has the level to be there, really,‚Äù Alcaraz said during a news conference Monday in Paris. I'm pretty sure he's gonna keep building his path and (will) become a really good tennis player.‚Äù Six months before that training block, Cobolli drew Alcaraz in the first round of the 2023 French Open ‚Äî his first main-draw match at a major. Carlos on clay, first time main draw,'‚Äù Cobolli said of a match he ended up losing in straight sets, including a 25-minute bagel in the first. Cobolli said that ‚ÄúCarlos is a bit higher level‚Äù than anyone he'd faced, including Novak Djokovic. Sponsored by Lotto at the time, Cobolli formally joined On four months later. The Swiss sportswear company's roster also includes four-time Roland Garros champion Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek, top-20 American Shelton and Fonseca, who is considered the sport's most exciting youngster. Joining has raised Cobolli's profile, and with a game based more on style than power ‚Äî he's only 6 feet ‚Äî his matches can catch fire. At last year's French Open, he played out a barn-burner against Holger Rune, as their late-night, second-round match on Court 14 turned into one of the matches of the tournament. Cobolli was ultimately edged out in a final set tie-break that he had led 5-0, before Rune hit a slap-shot backhand return that changed the complexion of the match's final minutes. Does Cobolli ever watch Roma and think he could be playing? ‚ÄúOf course ‚Äî every match, I think it,‚Äù he said matter-of-factly. A number of his friends have gone on to play for the Roma first team, many of whom he plays padel with. Though born and raised in Florence, Roma is Cobolli's biggest passion. When he won the French Open boys' doubles title as an 18-year-old in 2020, Cobolli celebrated by hoisting a Roma scarf into the sky. He has the Italian phrase ‚Äúsei tu l'unica mia sposa, sei tu l'unico mio amor,‚Äù which translates as ‚Äúyou are my only wife, you are my only love,‚Äù inked on his chest. It's a quote about Roma from club legend Daniele De Rossi, who wrote it on the captain's armband when he was managing the team between January and September 2024. Cobolli describes De Rossi as his ‚Äúidol outside the court.‚Äù Another of Cobolli's friends from his Roma days is Riccardo Calafiori, the swashbuckling defender who signed for Arsenal from Bologna last summer. ‚ÄúI texted him then just to say, ‚ÄòCongrats for your move.' ‚ÄúWe played in the same team at Roma, and he was amazing with his feet. Another of their team-mates was Edoardo Bove, whom Cobolli met aged seven and now plays for Fiorentina. They became great friends playing together at the Roma academy, and Bove was also a gifted tennis player. Cobolli was watching the game and broke down in tears. ‚ÄúI froze immediately,‚Äù Cobolli told the ATP Tour in December. In Paris, Cobolli said that Bove had surprised him by showing up at the Hamburg final. He still enjoys playing football tennis with some of his peers on the ATP Tour, including other talented footballers Alcaraz and Sebastian Korda, who he cites as one of the best in the locker room. Korda is close to footballing royalty, too ‚Äî his girlfriend Ivana is the daughter of Pavel Nedvƒõd, the former Ballon d'Or winner. Cobolli treasures these friendships from his Roma days, but ultimately chose tennis over football because, as well as his greater talent with a racket, he prefers the responsibility of an individual sport. ‚ÄúI don't like to play with a team,‚Äù he said. I don't like to lose because of someone else.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff broke down in tears during a tense French Open moment at last year's tournament. Attempting to advance to the 2024 women's finals, Gauff challenged a controversial call while playing No. Knowing that she needed to rally in the second set, Gauff dug in and played more aggressive. 3 seed held a 2-1 lead in the second when play abruptly stopped. "Coco Gauff is not happy," an announcer said. "Wow terrible call," one fan tweeted. So argumentative and often terrible calls. When is this going to stop?" While TV announcers discussed the "emotional aspect" of tennis and sports psychologists, Gauff was shown coldly staring straight ahead while sitting down. But Swiatek battled back to move ahead 5-3 in the second set. "She is progressing a lot," Swiatek said. "I'm sure we're going to have plenty more matches at a high level." Gauff became highly emotional in 2022 when she almost won the French Open as an 18-year-old. Wowing Paris fans with her power and precision on the clay courts, Gauff ended up just two sets away from becoming a French Open champion. "This is the first time for me, so let's try to get through this," an emotional Gauff said in the aftermath. With fans standing and applauding inside the venue, Gauff paid tribute to Swiatek and joked that she hoped to one day end as a winner when playing the game's No. "What you've done on tour the past couple months have truly been amazing and you totally deserve it," Gauff told Poland's superstar. "Hopefully we can play each other in more finals." As Gauff referenced her supporters, tears began to flow. Gauff turned her head and wiped her eyes while holding a microphone, then publicly praised all those who helped her reach the finals at 18. She made amends in the women's doubles final alongside partner Katerina Siniakov√°, lifting her first Grand Slam tournament doubles trophy after defeating 11th seeds Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini. Gauff grew up admiring Serena Williams and had a poster of the tennis legend on her wall. After a tough start to 2025, the world No.2 began her French Open singles campaign on Tuesday against Australian Olivia Gadecki. She was in scintillating form and reeled off a straightforward 6-2, 6-2 victory.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu once made a surprise revelation when asked how she would spend her U.S. Open winnings. Raducanu shocked the sporting world in September 2021 by coming through qualifying to defeat Leylah Fernandez in the final as a teenager. Moreover, Raducanu received the ¬£1.8million ($2.5m) grand prize for her U.S. Open triumph. Many may have expected the teenager to splash out on big-money purchases, but she took a more low-key approach. When asked how she planned to spend her new fortune, replacing a pair of lost AirPods was Raducanu's top priority. ‚ÄúThere's a running joke in my team because before my first round qualifying match I lost my AirPods and I was basically running around the changing room like three minutes before my call to go on trying to find it but I lost it,‚Äù she told ESPN after her U.S. Open victory. Before her U.S. Open success, Raducanu's career earnings stood at just over ¬£200k. Fun moment as Raducanu tells ESPN her first goal at the #usopen was to earn enough prize money to replace her lost Airpods pic.twitter.com/Ewsvki49Z8 In an interview on BBC Breakfast days after her Grand Slam win, Raducanu explained: ‚ÄúI will just leave that to my parents and my team, to be honest. It was likely a wise move, as both her parents work in finance. I know that there are a lot of taxes and expenses.‚Äù This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Raducanu, 22, has yet to secure another major titlle, but she defeated Xinyu Wang to progress in the French Open on Monday. She is scheduled to face defending champion Iga Swiatek in the second round tomorrow. The British number two was recently asked about the possibility of hiring Andy Murray as a coach following his recent split from working with Novak Djokovic. The pair planned to team up in mixed doubles at Wimbledon last year, but Raducanu withdrew due to injury, denying Murray one last chance at Wimbledon glory. ‚ÄúI'm looking forward to seeing him around and having a conversation. ‚ÄúI think he would give great advice, he's been in a similar situation and would probably understand a lot of things that I'm also going through. But as to anything more, I don't know, that's very far out of thought.‚Äù See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crowd behaviour at Roland-Garros this year has come into focus after Iga Swiatek and David Goffin expressed displeasure over treatment from fans in 2024, with Goffin declaring the atmosphere "is becoming like football." Moretton also defended French officials against complaints men's matches were being played in the prime-time spot at night in Paris ahead of the women's games which have been played in the morning. READ MORE: 'Shouldn't have any bearing': The curious case of Terrell May READ MORE: Gould whacks Sexton's agent while Mahoney request confirmed READ MORE: 'Struggling' star among six most under pressure in Origin Yet when it came to the fans and whether they're more boisterous than those seen at other tournaments, Moretton shut down the claim. "You're talking about the French players playing? I was in Australia," the French Tennis Federation chief said. We feel like that atmosphere is good for tennis. If it goes too far, we will have to say something. I hope it not bother too much the players. Watch all the action from Roland Garros 2025 live & on-demand on Stan Sport, with two courts in 4K UHD. Australian Adam Walton, who plays German Maximillian Marterer in an opening round match on Tuesday night, agreed with Moretton, staying he copped it from the crowd when he played Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech last year. "When I played the Australian Open, it was all for me and then obviously here, it was all against me," he said. Regarding men's matches taking precedence over women in the prime time night slot, Moretton said tournament boss and former world No.1 Amelie Mauresmo had a duty to schedule the match of the day at night. The issue of scheduling comes up every year at every grand slam and it's no different at Roland-Garros this year, when Swiatek posted her 22nd straight win at Roland Garros in front of a half-empty crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday morning (local time). "But on the other hand, people just try to look for, like, not even things between men and women. You can find that in the schedule a little bit, and you can ask us all the time, but honestly, my answers are not going to change, so I don't mind." French veteran Gael Monfils has the night match on Tuesday (Wednesday morning AEST).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aussie Jordan Thompson has revealed Nick Kyrgios is 'pretty down' after another knee injury forced him to withdraw from the French Open, while Naomi Osaka broke down in tears during her press conference after a first-round loss. Kyrgios surprised the tennis community having announced he was building his match fitness in order to play doubles at Roland Garros with Thompson. Clay has never been Kygrios' favourite surface and in the past he has opted to skip a number of the major events to save his body for the grass court season. Unfortunately, Thompson revealed Kyrgios injured himself while training in Australia. And in a sad revelation Thompson claimed Kyrgios was finding it harder and harder to return from each injury. "I know he was back home in Australia training on clay, but a few days ago, Nick told me that he's done something to his knee, so unfortunately, he just couldn't be here. Thompson will now partner fellow Aussie Jason Kubler for a first-round match on Tuesday against French pair Quentin Halys and Albano Olivetti. After dealing with a number of wrist and knee injuries that ruled him out for around 18 months, Kyrgios made his comeback at the Australian Open where he went down in the first round. Unfortunately, Kyrgios has only played four singles matches in 2025 having won his only match in Miami earlier this year. Last year, Kyrgios turned his attention to commentary having been ruled out for SW19. Nadal's shock admission as fans erupt over Federer and Djokovic moment Fans shattered over 'very sad' news as Alex de Minaur cops brutal draw Jelena Dokic's difficult message as estranged father Damir dies Unfortunately for Osaka, she was left frustrated after Paula Badosa came from behind to clinch a three-set victory in their first round encounter. Osaka won the first set, but wasn't able to lift her game when Badosa rallied with the Spaniard prevailing 6-7 6-1 6-4 in an exciting clash. However, Osaka was hard on herself after the loss and broke down in tears when talking about her trainer and the people she felt she had let down. Even with Patrick I was thinking just now that he goes from working with like the greatest player ever to like‚Ä¶ what the f**k this is," she said fighting back tears. Traditionally, she has never had much success on clay having reached the third round at the event three times, but never advancing beyond that. And she will be looking to do even better at Wimbledon with plenty of fans rallying around the tennis star after her latest setback. Naomi Osaka should be reminded that she's won four majors - more than all but one active WTA player - and is only 27. While Kyrgios won't be taking part in the tournament, he will feature as a commentator in Paris. Kyrgios hasn't competed at Roland Garros since 2017 having reached the second round. And while he won't get another chance to better that record in 2025, he will be on the sideline offering his analysis. Kyrgios is increasingly turning his attention to media opportunities in recent years having made an appearance as a commentator at Wimbledon last year. The Aussie's guest appearances were met with plenty of praise. And after Thompson's latest comments about Krygios' setback, it appears a media career could be a future path for the 30-year-old. Unfortunately for Thompson and the Aussie contingent it was not a great opening day on clay in Paris. Aleksandar Vukic, Chris O'Connell, Daria Saville, Kim Birrell and a battered Thompson all went down in the opening round. But Alexei Popyrin managed to reach the second round of Roland Garros having broken his drought of first round exits. Those places that always seem to bring pain. For Naomi Osaka, it's Roland Garros, and it goes far beyond the red clay courts that have always felt unnatural to a self-described ‚Äúhard-court kid.‚Äù She has never made it past the first week here. The next year, she pulled out, following a standoff with tournament organizers over mandatory appearances at post-match news conferences while she managed the impact One specific detail in the scene drew sharp criticism from a concerned onlooker. As his hopeful doubles partner revealed why Nick Kyrgios had to pull out of the French Open, a trio of Aussies got on the winners' list.
